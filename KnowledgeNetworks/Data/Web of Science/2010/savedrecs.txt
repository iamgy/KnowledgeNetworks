Irradiation of synthetic garnet by heavy ions and alpha-decay of Cm-244	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							SELF-RADIATION DAMAGE; BEAM-INDUCED AMORPHIZATION; NUCLEAR-WASTE; ACTINIDE MATRICES; IMMOBILIZATION; PYROCHLORE; PLUTONIUM; STABILITY; MINERALS; DISORDER	Garnet, A(3)B(2)X(3)O(12), has a structure that can incorporate actinides. Hence, the susceptibility of the garnet structure to radiation damage has been investigated by comparing the results of self-radiation damage from alpha-decay of Cm-244 and a 1 MeV Kr2+ ion irradiation. Gradual amorphization with increasing fluence was observed by X-ray diffraction analysis and in situ transmission electron microscopy. The critical dose, D-c, for an yttrium aluminum garnet (Y3Al5O12) doped with 3 wt.% Cm-244 is calculated to be 0.4 displacements per atom (dpa). While the doses obtained by ion irradiation experiments of garnets with different compositions (Y2.43Nd0.57)(Al4.43Si0.44)O-12, (Ca1.64Ce0.41Nd0.42La0.18Pr0.18Sm0.14Gd0.04)Zr1.27Fe3.71O12, and (Ca1.09Gd1.23Ce0.43)Sn1.16Fe3.84O12, varied from 0.29 to 0.55 dpa at room temperature. The similarity in the amorphization dose at room temperature and critical temperature of the different garnet compositions suggest that the radiation response for the garnet structure is structurally constrained, rather than sensitive to composition, which is the case for the pyrochlore structure-type.

J	Trummer, M; Dahlgren, B; Jonsson, M				Trummer, Martin; Dahlgren, Bjorn; Jonsson, Mats			The effect of Y2O3 on the dynamics of oxidative dissolution of UO2	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							SPENT NUCLEAR-FUEL; RADIATION-INDUCED DISSOLUTION; WASTE-DISPOSAL CONDITIONS; FISSION-PRODUCTS; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; RADIOLYSIS PRODUCTS; AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; HYDROGEN; KINETICS; SOLUBILITY	In this work, we have studied the impact of Y2O3 on the kinetics of oxidative dissolution of UO2 and the consumption of H2O2. The second order kinetics of catalytic consumption of H2O2 on Y2O3 was investigated in aqueous Y2O3 powder suspensions by varying the solid surface area to solution volume ratio. The resulting second order rate constant is 10(-8) m s(-1), which is of the same magnitude as for the reaction between H2O2 and UO2. Powder experiments with mixtures of UO2 and Y2O3 show that Y2O3 has no effect on the oxidative dissolution of UO2, whereas the consumption of H2O2 seems to be slightly slower in the presence of Y2O3 and H-2 respectively. UO2 pellets with solid inclusions of Y2O3 show a decrease in oxidative dissolution by a factor of 3.3 and 5.3 under inert and hydrogen atmosphere, respectively. The rate of H2O2 consumption is similar for all cases and is well in line with kinetic data from powder experiments. The effects of H-2 and Y2O3 on the oxidative dissolution of UO2 under gamma irradiation are similar to those found in experiments with H2O2. No significant difference in dissolution between inert and reducing atmosphere can be observed for pure UO2. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effect of surface water on tritium release behavior from Li4SiO4	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			Li4SiO4; Tritium; Surface water	PURGE GAS	The tritium release model to represent the release behavior of bred tritium from solid breeder materials has been developed by the blanket group of Kyushu University. It has been found that water is released to the purge gas from solid breeder materials and that this water affects the tritium release behavior. In this study, the amount of surface water released from Li4SiO4 is quantified by the experiment. In addition, the tritium release behavior from Li4SiO4 are estimated based on the tritium release model using parameters obtained in our studies under conditions of commercial reactor operation and ITER test blanket module operation. The effect of the surface water on tritium release behavior is discussed from the obtained results. Moreover, the tritium inventory of Li4SiO4 is discussed based on calculation under the unsteady state condition. Further, the effects of grain size and temperature on distribution of tritium inventory under the steady state condition are evaluated, and the optimal grain size is discussed from the view point of tritium release from Li4SiO4.

The EU joins the discussions and assessment of the R&D results. As the recent activities on the tritium technologies of the BA program, a multi-purpose RI facility, where the above R&D subjects will be carried out, has been designed in detail. A preliminary safety study has also been carried out for the amount of tritium released to the environment and for the radiation dose of workers. The facility is now under construction at Rokkasho in Aomori. The main subjects of the R&D of tritium analysis are the technologies for real-time analysis for hydrogen isotopes, gas, liquid and solid (such as microGC and calorimeter). The materials of interest include F82H, SiC, ZrCo, solid and liquid advanced breeder and multipliers. In the tritium durability tests, organic materials and metals planned to be used in a DEMO plant are studied for the radiation and the corrosion damage. A series of preliminary studies for the above subjects has been started. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Using pure tritium at a pressure of 0.6 Pa on the front side of the composite, the steady-state tritium permeation flux was estimated to be 9.5 x 10(-12) mol m(-2) s(-1). In experiments with tritium diluted with hydrogen, it was found that the steady-state permeation fluxes went down with a decrease of tritium fraction in tritium-hydrogen gas mixture, although the partial pressure of tritium on the front side was fixed at 0.6 Pa.

In this study, two different honeycomb-type adsorbents (honeycomb-K and honeycomb-N) and pebble-type adsorbents were used as samples and the water vapor adsorption performance of each adsorbent was examined by changing temperature, concentration of water vapor and flow rate. The honeycomb-K and honeycomb-N adsorbents included zeolite-4A or zeolite-5A with a 50% clay binder and with a 15% sepiolite binder, respectively. The shapes of cells in honeycomb-K and honeycomb-N are triangles with 1 mm sides and squares with 1 mm sides, respectively, and the cell densities of the both adsorbents were 200 CPSI (cells/in.(2)). The adsorption capacity for water vapor on the honeycomb-K adsorbent was comparable to that on the pebble-type adsorbent, while the adsorption capacity on the honeycomb-N adsorbent was lower. The adsorption rates of honeycomb-K and honeycomb-N adsorbents were higher than that of the pebble-type adsorbent. The honeycomb-K adsorbent containing zeolite-5A showed a higher adsorption rate than that containing zeolite-4A. Thus, honeycomb-K containing zeolite-5A adsorbent could be applicable to air cleanup systems in terms of both adsorption capacity and rate. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Use of alumina coating is one of the most promising methods to solve this problem. In the present study, well-adhered alumina coatings on ferritic steel substrates were prepared by the sol-gel method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field-emission scanning electron microscope (FSEM) were employed to identify the phase and examine the microstructure of the coating. The coating prepared at 500 degrees C is amorphous, while that prepared at 650 degrees C is gamma-Al2O3. When calcination temperature is elevated to 1100 degrees C, alpha-Al2O3 is formed. The surface of the well-adhered coating was smooth and uniform. No spallations and cracks were observed in the coating or at the scale/alloy interface. The grain size of the coating remains very small even at 1100 degrees C (in the range 30-40 nm for 1100 degrees C). The thickness of the coating can be controlled by changing aging time and the number of dipping cycles. The flexibility to coat complex geometries by this method, even inside tubes, is guaranteed.

The radiation analyses of ITER lower ports	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			ITER; Lower ports; Neutronics; Radiation streaming		The ITER Vacuum Vessel has upper, equatorial, and lower ports used for equipment installation, diagnostics, heating and current drive systems, cryo-vacuum pumping, and access inside the vessel for maintenance. At the level of the divertor, the nine lower ports for remote handling, cryo-vacuum pumping and diagnostic are inclined downwards and toroidally located each every 40 degrees. The cryopump port has additionally a branch to allocate a second cryopump. The ports, as openings in the Vacuum Vessel, permit radiation streaming out of the vessel which affects the heating in the components in the outer regions of the machine inside and outside the ports. Safety concerns are also raised with respect to the dose after shutdown at the cryostat behind the ports: in such zones the radiation dose level must be kept below the regulatory limit to allow personnel access for maintenance purposes. Neutronic analyses have been required to qualify the ITER project related to the lower ports. A 3-D model was used to take into account full details of the ports and the lower machine surroundings. MCNP version 5 1.40 has been used with the FENDL 2.1 nuclear data library. The ITER 40 degrees model distributed by the ITER Organization was developed in the lower part to include the relevant details. The results of a first analysis, focused on cryopump system only, were recently published. In this paper more complete data on the cryopump port and analysis for the remote handling port and the diagnostic rack are presented; the results of both analyses give a complete map of the radiation loads in the outer divertor ports. Nuclear heating, dpa, tritium production, and dose rates after shutdown are provided and the implications for the design are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Risk mitigation strategy for the ITER electron cyclotron upper port launcher	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			Electron cyclotron heating; Risk analysis; ITER		A basic requirement for ITER equipment to meet is a high level of reliability, because ITER operation time is precious and radioactive operation leaves limited scope for repair. In order to reduce the risk of failure during ITER operation an effective risk mitigation strategy is necessary. This paper presents such strategy for the ITER electron cyclotron upper port launcher (ECUPL). A preliminary ECUPL risk analysis identifies possible failure modes. A probabilistic risk assessment quantifies the risk of failure using a 4 x 4 impact-likelihood matrix. Impact is quantified through technical, cost and schedule elements. Likelihood depends on the risk mitigation strategy adopted. A cost benefit analysis determines the most cost effective risk mitigation strategy. An essential element in risk mitigation is the testing of equipment prior to installation on the ITER machine. This paper argues the need for low- and highpower millimetre wave tests carried out on the fully assembled ECUPL It presents a conceptual design for a dedicated on-site test bed that can handle 2 of 8 microwave beams at 2 MW long pulse operation.

Out of pile tritium release behaviour and microscopic investigation of lithium metatitanate irradiated in the High Flux Reactor in Petten	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			Fusion; HCPB; Pebble bed; Tritium release; Inventory	CERAMIC BREEDER	The irradiation experiment EXOTIC 9/1 is the latest in a series of EXOTICs that has been irradiated in the high flux reactor in Petten and studies tritium release and inventory in ceramic pebbles containing lithium, which are key properties for the fusion fuel cycle. New production routes of pebbles are developed, leading to different thermomechanical and tritium release properties. The pebbles, produced by an extrusion-spheroidisation-sintering process at CEA in 2004, differ in porosity and density from the Li(2)TiO(3) ceramics tested in the previous EXOTIC 8 programme. The pebbles have a diameter in the range from 0.6 to 0.8 mm, a high density (93% TD) and an open porosity of 1.7%. The pebbles mainly differ in enrichment (7.5% and 30% (6)Li-enrichment). During irradiation of 300 Full Power Days in the HFR in Petten, the temperature in EXOTIC 9/1 was varied between 340 and 580 degrees C. The final irradiation (EOL) temperature is 480 degrees C and the average total (6)Li burn-up is 3%. The total measured activity from tritium during irradiation is 220.42 Ci. After the completion of the irradiation, the out of pile release behaviour was studied by temperature programmed desorption (TPD). More specifically, the remaining tritium inventory in the pebbles and the activation energy of different release mechanisms were studied. The TPD was carried out for Li2TiO3 samples with 7.5% (natural) and 30% (enriched) (6)Li-abundance and revealed very different curves, indicating that the materials have different release mechanisms. Dissolving the irradiated samples in hydrogen peroxide indicates that no tritium is left in the pebbles after TPD. Results from optical microscopy show it is likely that more intense bubble formation has taken place in the enriched samples, compared to the natural samples. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Thermal-mechanical and thermal-hydraulic integrated study of the Helium-Cooled Lithium Lead Test Blanket Module	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			HCLL; TBM; Thermal-mechanical analyses	ITER	The Helium-Cooled Lithium Lead Test Blanket Module (HCLL-TBM) is one of the two TBM to be installed in an ITER equatorial port since day 1 of operation, with the specific aim to investigate the main concept functionalities and issues such as high efficiency helium cooling, resistance to thermo-mechanical stresses, manufacturing techniques, as well as tritium transport, magneto-hydrodynamics effects and corrosion. In particular, in order to show a DEMO-relevant thermo-mechanical and thermal-hydraulic behavior, the HCLL-TBM has to meet several requirements especially as far as its coolant thermofluid-dynamic conditions and its thermal-mechanical field are concerned. The present paper is focused on the assessment of the HCLL-TBM thermal-mechanical performances under both nominal and accidental load conditions, by adopting a computational approach based on the Finite Element Method. A realistic 3D finite element model of the whole HCLL-TBM, in the horizontal first wall design has been set up, consisting of about 597,000 elements and 767,000 nodes. In particular, since the thermal fields of both the module and the coolant are strictly coupled, the helium flow domain has been modeled too and a thermal contact model has been set up to properly simulate the convective heat transfer between the structure wall and the coolant. Pure conductive heat transfer has been assumed within the Pb-Li eutectic alloy of the breeder units. The volumetric density of the nuclear deposited power, recently calculated at Department of Nuclear Engineering of the University of Palermo by the MCNP 4C code, has been applied as distributed thermal load in order to assess the potential influence on the module thermo-mechanical performances of the markedly non-uniform poloidal and toroidal distributions that have been predicted within the Segment Box. Different loading scenarios have been considered as to the heat flux onto the module First Wall. Steady state and transient thermal-mechanical analyses have been carried out and the detailed spatial distributions of the thermal and mechanical fields obtained as to the considered loading scenarios are reported, together with a critical analysis intended to verify their compliance with the agreed design criteria and the DEMO relevance requirements.

It was implied that a AlO(OH) layer was formed on the surface of the gamma-LiAlO2 ceramics, at the same time LiAl2(OH)(7)center dot xH(2)O was obtained in the water. The process of the interaction between gamma-LiAlO2 ceramics and water was deduced. The attempts to improve the water compatibility of gamma-LiAlO2 ceramics were made. It was confirmed that the surface modification by LiAl5O8 decreased the surface alkalinity and restrained the hydrolysis of the gamma-LiAlO2 ceramics in water due to the low hydrolysis of the lithium deficient phase LiAl5O8. The experimental results revealed that the introduction of the lithium deficient phase. LiAl5O8, effectively improved the water compatibility of the gamma-LiAlO2 ceramics. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Wet scrubber technology for tritium confinement at ITER	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			ITER; Tritium confinement; Air detritiation		Operation of the ITER machine with tritium plasma requires tritium confinement systems to protect workers and the environment. Tritium confinement at ITER is based on multistage approach. The final stage provides tritium confinement in building sectors and consists of building's walls as physical barriers and control of sub-atmospheric pressure in those volumes as a dynamic barrier. The dynamic part of the confinement function shall be provided by safety important components that are available all the time when required. Detritiation of air prior to its release to the environment is based on catalytic conversion of tritium containing gaseous species to water vapour followed by their isotopic exchange with liquid water in scrubber column of packed bed type. Wet scrubber technology has been selected because of its advantages over conventional air detritiation technique based on gas drying by water adsorption. The most important design target of system availability was very difficult to meet with conventional water adsorption driers.

Modification of a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) electrolyser to ensure tritium compatibility	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			Water detritiation; Solid polymer electrolyte electrolyser; Tritium compatibility; CECE	SYSTEMS; WATER	A Water Detritiation System (WDS) is required for the ITER Tritium Plant in order to process tritiated water which is accumulated in various subsystems (e.g. the hall ventilation systems). For the ITER-WDS, the Combined Electrolysis Catalytic Exchange (CECE) process with an electrolyser unit as one of the major components is envisaged. An experimental WDS was built and commissioned at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (ILK) for the investigation of various subsystems of the CECE process in tritium environment. The TLK-WDS consists of an 8 m Liquid Phase Catalytic Exchange column and two Solid Polymer Electrolyte electrolysers, each with a maximum hydrogen output of 1 m(3)/h. The commercially available Hogen40 electrolyser units from Proton Energy Systems are not tritium compatible concerning materials, joints and quality documentation (e.g. necessary certificates). In order to process tritiated water with tritium concentrations up to 370GBq/kg, tritium compatibility had to be ensured by appropriate modifications. Up to now, the modified system has been operated with tritiated water for 3500 h, the maximum tritium concentration in the electrolysers being 190 GBq/kg. This contribution reports on the necessary modifications of the electrolyser units and the experiences gained thereby. The results are equally important for the ITER-WDS, where the maximum tritium concentration in the feed water of the electrolyser units will be even higher with 11 TBq/kg. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Isotopic exchange between hydrogen and deuterium in the process of permeating through Li0.17Pb0.83	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			Tritium; Hydrogen isotopes; Permeation; Recovery; Lithium lead	LI-PB	The permeation process of hydrogen isotopes through Li0.17Pb0.83 has been investigated experimentally. We obtained the overall D permeation rates that take into consideration of the effects of the H-D isotopic exchange reaction on the surface and diffusion in the Li-Pb layer. It was proved that the rate-determining step was not the surface reaction but the diffusion in the Li-Pb bulk. We proposed a system of gas-liquid counter-current extraction using a packed column for continuous tritium recovery. The concentration profiles through the column and tritium extraction rates are calculated. It is estimated that the column height of 5 m is sufficient to achieve the tritium recovery ratio of 99.999%. This counter-current extraction method is easy to operate and efficient to recover tritium from Li-Pb. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Tritium is the radioisotope of protium, and is easily taken into the human body, and thus the behavior of tritium accidentally released in fusion power plants should be studied for the safety design and radioprotection of workers. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the behavior of tritium released into large rooms with objectives. since complex flow fields should exist in such rooms and they could influence the ventilation of the air containing released tritium. Thus, tritium release experiments were conducted using Caisson Assembly for Tritium Safety Study (CATS) in TPL/JAEA. Some data were taken for tritium behavior in the ventilated area and response of tritium monitors. In the experiments, approximately 17 GBq of tritium was released into Caisson with the total volume of 12 m(3), and the room was ventilated at the rate of 12 m(3)/h after release of tritium. It was found that placement of an objective in the vessel substantially affects decontamination efficiency. With regard to an experimental result, numerical calculation was performed and the experimental result and the result of numerical calculation were compared, which indicates that experimental results are qualitatively reproduced by numerical calculation. However, further R&D needs to be carried out for quantitative reproduction of the experimental results. (c) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Effects of simultaneous transfer of heat and tritium through Li-Pb or Flibe blanket	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			Liquid blanket; Tritium; Permeation; Lithium lead; Flibe	HYDROGEN; PERMEATION; TRANSPORT; DATABASE; REACTOR; F82H	Transport of tritium (T) and heat is calculated to estimate the performance of liquid Li(17)Pb(83) (Li-Pb) or Li(2)BeF(4) (Flibe) as a T-breeder in a fusion reactor blanket. T is bred in such a way of low leak to facilities outside and continuous recovery by a removal system, and heat is transferred through structural walls to He coolant efficiently. In this paper, T permeation in a blanket composed of structural materials and liquid Li-Pb or Flibe is calculated based on data of previous experiment. The effects of T recovery ratio by the outside removal apparatus and fluid-film T diffusion resistance in the liquid blanket on overall T permeation rates are analytically clarified. Design of a liquid blanket with low T leak and high T recovery is discussed here. In addition, possibility in that microbubbles may be generated at interfaces between a liquid blanket and a structural wall is investigated. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Search for reality of solid breeder blanket for DEMO	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			DEMO; Blanket; TBR; Solid breeder; SlimCS	EFFECTIVE THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; PEBBLE BEDS; PLANT; REACTOR; DESIGN; JAERI	For a tokamak fusion DEMO reactor with the fusion output of 2.95 GW, neutronic and thermal design of blanket is under way to find a feasible blanket concept. For the continuity with the Japanese ITER-TBM options, this study considered water-cooled blanket with solid breeding materials of Li ceramics (Li(4)SiO(4), Li(2)TiO(3) and Li(2)ZrO(3)) and Be multipliers (Be and Be(12)Ti). Based on a neutronics-heat coupled analysis, the tritium breeding ratio was evaluated so as to satisfy constraints of the operating temperature of <= 900 degrees C for Li ceramics and Be12Ti, and <= 600 degrees C for Be. Cooling water condition was assumed to be 23 MPa and 290-360 degrees C. The result indicates that surplus tritium production in lower neutron wall load (P(n)) blanket compensates a shortfall in higher P(n) blanket and thus the overall tritium production can marginally satisfy fuel self-sufficiency.

Preliminary studies on MHD simulation and heat transfer analysis for LLCB TBM	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			LLCB TBM; MHD; Heat transfer	FLOW CHANNEL INSERT; TEST BLANKET MODULE; PRESSURE-DROP; DESIGN; ITER	The assessment of performance of tritium breeding and high-grade heat extraction in Test Blanket Modules (TBM) is one of the prime goals of ITER mission. India has proposed Lead-Lithium cooled Ceramic Breeder (LLCB) as the blanket concept for testing in ITER. The LLCB blanket concept consists of lithium titanate as ceramic breeder material in the form of packed pebble beds, lead-lithium as breeder and coolant. The Pb-Li flows separately around the pebble bed to extract heat from the breeder zones. The Pb-Li flow velocity is moderate enough such that its self generated heat and the heat transferred from ceramic breeder is extracted effectively. Helium is used as coolant for the external box structure. The main design objective is to obtain efficient blanket performance by limiting the structural material temperature to <550 degrees C, the Pb-Li to FMS interface temperatures within the corrosion limit of <480 degrees C. ceramic breeder temperatures window between 450 and 920 degrees C for tritium extraction and to prevent sintering of ceramic pebbles. The Pb-Li flow in presence of high magnetic field (similar to 4 tesla) is expected to be laminar but may impose some stringent conditions on the heat transfer properties due to magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects. Hence, preliminary MHD and thermal analysis of the LLCB TBM is performed by numerically solving the Navier-Stokes equation coupled with the continuity and induction equations over the cross section of a rectangular duct having transverse dimensions of the TBM to determine the pressure drop, fully developed axial velocity (u) and induced magnetic field (Bx). A control volume based iterative scheme and a Hartmann number sensitive non-uniform collocated grid is used in this study to evaluate the flow and electrical parameters for the LLCB TBM both with and without insulation coatings. The calculated velocity profile is then used as an input to the energy equation to obtain the temperature distribution and heat flow properties for a single channel within the TBM. For this study the average volumetric heat generated within each zone (layer) surrounding the channel is fed as the source term to the energy equation to study the temperature distribution in different zones of the TBM.

The current DS as the Safety Important Component (SIC) has been discussed and mainly consists of catalytic reactors, wet scrubber columns (SCs), and blowers. The functional failure of the DS designed with SC was evaluated using a database of failure experiences of various valves, controllers, and components. Regarding the tritium release into the biggest confinement sector of the Tokamak gallery, this design is improved by more than two orders of magnitude compared to the original DS designed with molecular sieves (MSs) dryer beds in the 2001 design report. This improvement is achieved mainly by the reduction of frequency of valve operation, like MS dryers requiring periodical regeneration, and by the standardized module arrangement of the DS with SC.

JET operating experience: Global analysis of tritium plant failure	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			Failure rates; Fusion machines; JET; Tritium system	COMPONENT FAILURE; COLLECTION; SYSTEMS	The objective of the activity was to build up an overall data collection about the existing experience on the performances and management of the system dedicated to handle the tritium at the Joint European Torus (JET). At first, the analysis performed in 2002 on data related to JET Active Gas Handling System (AGHS) failures was reviewed considering failures and system updating occurred in the AGHS between 2002 and 2006. Main reliability parameters associated to the components (i.e.: failure rate and the corresponding standard errors and confidence intervals) were estimated by means of investigation on failure modes of components and, where possible, causes and consequences of the failures. About 460 failures/malfunctions on a set of more than 6200 components, operating for about 215,000,000 h, were pointed out since 1995 up to 2006. By the comparison between this statistical assessment and the old one performed in the 2002 it is possible to note, apart few cases, the slight increase of failure rate values because of a slight deterioration of components, due to the ageing. The evaluated failure rates were also compared with failure rates existing in literature for similar applications (e.g.: nuclear power plants, tritium processing laboratories). A good agreement between the values from the different sources came out. Second step of the work was the detailed analysis of some relevant maintenance operations performed to repair significant failures in the plant. Unavailability of components and systems, possible impact on workers' doses and possible environmental releases related to the maintenance activities were scrutinized. The investigation highlights the very low consequences for workers in terms of doses and the negligible effects on environmental releases. The investigation also highlights essential key elements of procedures undertaken to perform maintenance on the AGHS. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Erbium oxide ceramic is a promising candidate material for a TPB coating because of its high electrical resistance and high compatibility with liquid lithium. In this paper, an Er(2)O(3) coating was fabricated by using a magnetron sputtering method to deposit it on a China Low Activation Martensitic (CLAM) steel substrate. Er was performed as the buffer in order to improve the adhesive property of the Er(2)O(3) ceramic. The crystallinity of the coating was observed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) after annealing. A dominant orientation (440) presented with a thickness more than 1.5 mu m. The structural properties, surface morphology and other physical properties of the coating were also studied.

Operating experiences from existing fusion facilities in view of ITER safety and reliability	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			Fusion; Failure rate; Availability; Operating experience	RADIATION-EXPOSURE DATA; COMPONENT FAILURE; DATA-COLLECTION; JET; DATABASE; TOKAMAK; SYSTEMS	The objective of this ongoing activity is to develop a fusion specific component failure database useful to quantify probabilistic safety assessment, support design activity, quantify reliability, availability, maintainability, and inspectability (RAMI) analyses, and support any other uses where field experience can provide feedback to fusion facility design and operation. The data collection began in 1989. At first, it was to "harvest" already-published data from high-technology industries. Later, attention was also directed to collecting and analyzing operating experience data from existing tokamaks and other fusion experiments. Operating experience of European. American and Japanese facilities are being investigated. The main studies performed thus far have been on JET systems (such as Vacuum, Active Gas Handling (AGH), Neutral Beam Injectors, Power Supply and Ion Cyclotron Resonant Heating systems), ASDEX Electron Cyclotron Resonant Heating system, and the Tore Supra cryogenics, superconducting magnet and water cooling system of plasma facing component for Europe; DIII-D, TFTR, Tritium Systems Test Assembly and other facilities for the United States; and the Tritium Processing Laboratory for Japan. Additional systems will be investigated in the future. The paper is dedicated to give an overview on the overall activity, with indication of references, and a global overview on availability of different fusion devices. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Phase analysis and microstructure of the samples were determined by XRD and SEM, respectively. Complex electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to evaluate the electrical conduction properties of the sintered ceramics. The experimental results showed that Ta(2)O(5) could dissolve in Li(2)TiO(3) and reached the saturation degree of about 25% at 1100 degrees C. The doped samples possessed much higher ionic conductivity than the primitive Li(2)TiO(3) with the most favorable doping level of 25%. At 300 degrees C, the ionic conductivity of the doped Li(2)Ti(0.75)Ta(0.25)O(3.125) (x = 0.25) ceramics achieved 9.00 x 10(-5) S cm(-1), more than 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the primitive Li(2)TiO(3) ceramics (7.75 x 10(-7) S cm(-1)).

The advantage of using the plastic scintillator would be not expected to produce waste of liquid scintillator. Following the process of catalytic oxidization in the tritiated gas sampling system, a combined nebulizer and denuder tube was considered instead of a moisture absorber. The scintillation produced by exposure beta particle of tritium in the recovered water to the plastic scintillator was detected with a photomultiplier tube. The sensitivity to measure the tritium concentration in water was experimentally obtained. Then good linear relationships between the count rate and radioactivity were observed. Also the sensitivity to tritium and high-energy beta decay nuclides such as (14)C and (90)Sr in water were compared. The detection efficiency depended on the range of beta particle and the surface area of the plastic scintillator attached to the solution. Improving the effective surface area of the plastic scintillator would lead to a useful monitor. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Removal rates of hydrogen isotope from liquid Li by HF-treated Y plate	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			Tritium; Li; IFMIF; Recovery; Purification; Yttrium; Blanket	TRITIUM; DESIGN	The International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF) is designed to provide an intense neutron source for the development of fusion reactor materials. Neutron is supplied by the D-(7)Li reaction, and at the same time tritium (T) is generated as its by-product. Therefore, the removal of T generated in Li becomes inevitable. It is proved in the present study that HF pretreatment of Y getter materials leads to enhance hydrogenating rates of Y placed in Li. The ratio of the H removal rate of HF-treated Y to that of non-treated Y is determined under the conditions of three different temperatures of 573 K, 553 K and 523 K. The effect of enhancement of hydrogenating rates is quantitatively determined. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The perfomances are analyzed based on two different fuel cycles. The first fuel cycle assumes separation of all Transuranics elements (TRU) from Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) and then burning in FBF1N; the second fuel cycle considers a first burning of fissile TRUs in Light Water Reactors (LWR) using an Inert Matrix Fuel (IMF). It is found that the FBFW (1 GWe) can support 5.8 LWR plants (1 GWe) or 19 LWR plants (1 GWe) for IMF fuel cycle. The neutron-dependent characteristics of the system, such as k(eff) and Tritium Breeding Ratio (TBR), are investigated. The TBR is found to be strongly dependent on k(eff) and a three-batch strategy is proven to be sufficient to maintain a moderate fusion power (<200 MW) and a satisfactory batch burn-up for IMF fuel cycle.

Li(2)TiO(3) and Li(4)SiO(4) ceramic spheres with favorable sphericity were obtained by a newly developed method, the water-based sol-gel process, which was expected to lead to a scale up to a low cost and efficient manufacturing process for mass production. The ionic conductivity of Li2TiO3 was enhanced significantly by introducing appropriate dopants to the matrix materials, which was probably helpful to the release and inventory performance of the tritium. Gel-casting and plastic forming process were conducted to fabricate gamma-LiAlO(2) ceramic bars and ceramic rings, respectively. It was found that the rheological and chemorheology behaviors of the precursors were influential to the fabrication process. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this work, we developed a self-healing composite coating to address this problem. The coating composed of TiC + mixture(TiC/Al(2)O(3)) + Al(2)O(3) was deposited on martensitic steels by means of atmospheric plasma spraying (APS). Before and after heat treatment, the morphology and phase of the coating were comparatively investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). In the experiment, NiAl + Al(2)O(3). mixture(TiC/Al(2)O(3)) + Al(2)O(3) and NiAl +TiC + mixture(TiC/Al(2)O(3)) + Al(2)O(3) films were also fabricated and studied, respectively. The results showed that the TiC + mixture(TiC/Al(2)O(3)) + Al(2)O(3) coating exhibited the best self-healing ability and good thermal shock resistance among the four samples after heat treatment under normal atmosphere. The SEM images analyzed by Image Pro software indicated that the porosity of the TiC + mixture(TiC/Al(2)O(3)) + Al(2)O(3) coating decreased more than 90% in comparison with the sample before heat treatment. This self-healing coating made by thermal spraying might be a good candidate for tritium permeation barrier in fusion reactors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Configuration and operation of detritiation systems for ITER Tokamak Complex	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			Tritium; Detritiation; Confinement; Safety; Modelling	TRITIUM; CONFINEMENT; DESIGN	The ventilation systems design for the ITER nuclear buildings ensures radioactive contamination is confined so that workers, the public and the environment are protected. Nuclear buildings are divided into confinement sectors which connect to the Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system and detritiation system (DS). The Tokamak Complex DS provides centralized air purification for the building confinement sectors. A distributed arrangement of ventilation piping provides networks necessary for two key functions, these being Vent Detritiation (VD), to maintain sub-atmospheric pressure, and Air Detritiation (AD) to collect tritium released into the confinement sector. For the VD function, air extracted from the particular confinement sector is directed to the DS for processing prior to exhaust to the environment. This paper presents the configuration of the DS of the Tokamak Complex and addresses details of the design of the distributed piping network. Dynamic flow and pressure drop modelling has been applied to support the development of the system configuration and provide data for sizing the system and selecting components. Further design development is discussed in view of the safety requirements for operation of the system during design basis events such as earthquake or fire. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Progress on an integrated multi-physics simulation predictive capability for plasma chamber nuclear components	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			Blanket technology; ITER; Design analysis; Simulation		Understanding the behavior of a plasma chamber component in the fusion environment requires a simulation technique that is capable of integrating multi-disciplinary computational codes while appropriately treating geometric heterogeneity and complexity. Such a tool should be able to interpret phenomena from mutually dependent scientific disciplines and predict performance with sufficient accuracy and consistency. Integrated multi-physics simulation predictive capability (ISPC) relies upon advanced numerical simulation techniques and is being applied to ITER first wall/shield and Test Blanket Module (TBM) designs. In this paper, progress in ISPC development is described through the presentation of a number of integrated simulations. The simulations cover key physical phenomena encountered in a fusion plasma chamber system, including tritium permeation, fluid dynamics, and structure mechanics. Interface engines were developed in order to pass field data, such as surface deformation or nuclear heating rate, from the structural analysis to the thermo-fluid MHD analysis code for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) velocity profile assessments, or from the neutronics analysis to the thermo-fluid analysis for temperature calculations, respectively. Near-term effort toward further ISPC development is discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Integrated simulation of tritium permeation in solid breeder blankets	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			Tritium permeation; Purge convection; Breeding blanket; 3D Model	FLOW	Numerical simulation of co-permeation of tritium and hydrogen from breeding zones to the coolant in the helium cooled pebble-bed blanket is performed in this paper. 3D multi-species convection-diffusion models integrated with thermal-fluid analysis in porous media are assessed and then used to estimate the associated tritium permeation for a solid breeder blanket module. Benchmark calculations give a reasonable agreement on the co-permeation rates with the experimental data. Simulation in a TBM unit show that purge gas flow can strongly affect tritium transport, increasing the purge flow velocity is an effective method to reduce tritium permeation to the coolant. In the case where hydrogen is added to the purge gas stream to promote tritium release, the co-permeation of H(2), T(2), and HT are taken into account in the permeation simulation, results show that permeation flux of T-T molecules is reduced due to the effect of co-permeation of hydrogen.

The release behavior was simulated based on a diffusion model. Characteristic deuterium releases of three types were found: (1) release by isotope exchange reaction of surface -OD(-) with a H(2) or H(2)O molecule in the atmosphere, (2) release as HDO by recombination with surface hydroxyls (-OD(-) and -OH(-)) on the surface, and (3) release as HDO or D(2)O by recombination with surface hydroxyls from the bulk at high temperatures. Release (1) occurred at room temperature, but release (2) occurred at about 600 K. The temperature range at which release (3) takes place depends on the diffusion path length: the plate specimen thickness and the grain specimen size. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The simulation results well reproduced the reported experimental observation that thermal conductivity decreases as temperature increases. However, the calculated values displayed some discrepancies from the experimental values obtained at high temperatures. Regarding the effect of Li vacancy, the thermal conductivities of systems containing 0.39 and 0.78 at.% of Li vacancies were evaluated. The thermal conductivity decreased a little as the Li-vacancy concentration increased. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Radiation deep penetration calculations for the IFMIF test cell wall	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			IFMIF; Shielding; Radiation dose; Coupled calculations		Deep radiation penetration calculations were performed for the IFMIF test cell wall on the basis of two different approaches employing the Monte-Carlo technique and a coupled Monte-Carlo/deterministic computational scheme called MCDO. For the Monte-Carlo calculations, the McDeLicious code was used which is an extension to MCNP-5 with the capability to simulate the d-Li neutron source on the basis of tabulated d-Li cross-section data. Use was made of a three dimensional geometry model of the IFMIF test cell representing in detail its interior and the shielding 3 m thick heavy concrete walls. The interface program MCDO, which couples McDeLicious and the 3D discrete ordinate code TORT, was used to transport the neutrons and photons through the wall and to obtain spatial distributions of the doses in the adjacent rooms. These coupled calculations have revealed hot spots of the radiation doses in the access room neighbouring the test cell in the d-beam downstream direction. The dose rate there exceeds several times the limit of 100 mu Sv/h for the work personnel. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Simakov, S.

India has developed two breeding blanket concepts such as, lead lithium cooled ceramic breeder (LLCB) and helium cooled ceramic breeder (HCCB) for its DEMO. LLCB concept will be tested in ITER where Li(2)TiO(3) ceramic breeder (CB) in the form of packed pebble beds is used as a tritium breeding material and PbLi eutectic is used as multiplier, breeder, and coolant for the CB zones. A detail engineering design and analysis has been executed for the LLCB TBM to optimize the flow parameters for helium and PbLi circuits, to estimate the temperature distribution in the various breeding zones and to ensure the thermal design limits for structural material and temperature window in ceramic breeder for effective tritium extraction. The detailed thermo-hydraulic CFD using Fluent and FE simulation studies will also be discussed in this paper. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The recovery of tritium from the moderator of operating Candu reactors and from the reactors to operate, represents a good opportunity for Romania to be involved in international collaboration programs in the field of nuclear fusion. Our interest is especially focussed on tritiated waste water with low activity resulted from the maintenance work performed on reactors with the purpose of reducing their volume and their reprocessing. The system presented in this work is based on the catalytic isotopic exchange and molecular dissociation CECE (Combined Electrolysis Catalytic Exchange). It has been noticed a growing interest regarding the electrolysers having polymer membranes as electrolyte SPM (solid polymer membrane). The advantage of using polymer membranes consists in the fact that membranes are actually the electrolyte and performs in the same time hydrogen and its isotopes separation. The present paper presents a conceptual design scheme for a tritium concentration system resulted from the tritiated waste water. This conceptual design represented the basis for the development of the installation for the tritiated waste water concentration, and the experiments to be performed will represent a support for promoting this technology. For designing the system and for analysing its functionality, a theoretical model for calculating tritium separation and concentration, has been developed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
