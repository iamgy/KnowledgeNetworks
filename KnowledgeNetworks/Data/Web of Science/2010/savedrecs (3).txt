ERROR ANALYSIS FOR THE IN-VIVO MEASUREMENT OF RADIONUCLIDES IN WOUNDS: MONTE CARLO STUDY	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						accident analysis; Am-241; Monte Carlo; radiation, gamma	PLUTONIUM; CALIBRATION; PHANTOMS	This paper describes calculation of error associated with the direct in-vivo measurements of radionuclides in a wound. A typical radiation injury to a hand with Am-241 radionuclide is illustrated for error analysis. A Monte Carlo model was developed and the detector pulse spectrum studied with a custom-designed HPGe detector. A pinhole collimator was designed, and its performance with a wide area detector was studied. The results show that significant errors might propagate if the lowest energy peaks of 241Am are used during in vivo measurements of the wound. In comparison to that, less uncertainty was found for 26.3 and 59.5 keV gamma peaks, and those levels are recommended for estimation of wound depth and activity.

PREDICTING INDUCED RADIOACTIVITY FOR THE ACCELERATOR OPERATIONS AT THE TAIWAN PHOTON SOURCE	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						electron storage ring; environmental impact; Monte Carlo; waste management	PARTICLE ACCELERATORS; LHC MATERIALS; FLUKA; BENCHMARK; CODE	This study investigates the characteristics of induced radioactivity due to the operations of a 3-GeV electron accelerator at the Taiwan Photon Source (TPS). According to the beam loss analysis, the authors set two representative irradiation conditions for the activation analysis. The FLUKA Monte Carlo code has been used to predict the isotope inventories, residual activities, and remanent dose rates as a function of time. The calculation model itself is simple but conservative for the evaluation of induced radioactivity in a light source facility. This study highlights the importance of beam loss scenarios and demonstrates the great advantage of using FLUKA in comparing the predicted radioactivity with corresponding regulatory limits. The calculated results lead to the conclusion that, due to fairly low electron consumption, the radioactivity induced in the accelerator components and surrounding concrete walls of the TPS is rather moderate and manageable, while the possible activation of air and cooling water in the tunnel and their environmental releases are negligible.

Radiation Effects in Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Thin-Film-Transistors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	NUCLEAR AND SPACE RADIATION EFFECTS CONFERENCE (NSREC)	JUL 19-23, 2010	Denver, CO			Carbon electronics; carbon nanotube field effect transistor; radiation effects; SWCNT-TFT; total ionizing dose (TID)	FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTORS; ALIGNED ARRAYS; ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES; NETWORKS; IRRADIATION; PERFORMANCE; ELECTRONICS; HYSTERESIS; CIRCUITS; RAMAN	The fabrication, characterization, and radiation response of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) thin-film field effect transistors (SWCNT-TFTs) has been performed. SWCNT-TFTs were fabricated on SiO2-Si substrates from 98% pure semiconducting SWCNTs separated by density gradient ultracentrifugation. Optical and Raman characterization, in concert with measured drain current I-on/I-off ratios, up to 10(4), confirmed the high enrichment of semiconducting-SWCNTs. Total ionizing dose (TID) effects, up to 10 MRads, were measured in situ for a SWCNT-TFT under static vacuum. The results revealed a lateral translation of the SWCNT-TFT transfer characteristics to negative gate bias resulting from hole trapping within the SiO2 and SiO2-SWCNT interface. Additional TID exposure conducted in air on the same device had the opposite effect, shifting the transfer characteristics to higher gate voltage, and increasing the channel conductance. No significant change was observed in the device mobility or the SWCNT Raman spectra following a TID exposure of 10 Mrad(Si), indicating extrinsic factors dominate the transfer characteristics in the SWCNT-TFT devices during irradiation. The extrinsic effects of charge trapping and the role that gas adsorption plays in the radiation response are discussed.

This technique widely used in standard laboratories allows measurements of the helium balance and reduced diffusion coefficients, and a preliminary evaluation of helium locations (related to defects and thermal annealing). In our system implemented in a hot cell, small samples are annealed at up to 1100 degrees C in controlled atmosphere. They are inserted in a 10 to 20 cm(3) vessel connected to a micro gas chromatography detector. Initial system calibration allowed concentration measurements within about 10%. Comparisons with the CNRS/CRPG rare gas analysis laboratory at Nancy, France, were applied on natural uranium oxides originating from Oklo (Gabon) and Mistamisk (Canada). The latest results obtained on Mistamisk samples are in good agreement, with a maximum relative deviation of 14%. The data were used to determine the activation energy of about 1 eVcdotat(-1). On (U, Pu)O(2) and PuO(2) samples the experiments highlight the impact of defects (up to 100 dpa) on He mobility. The defect population must now be characterized to improve our knowledge of He/defect interactions and mechanisms. In addition and synergy to the macroscopic release measurements by gas chromatography, positron annihilation spectroscopy, an effective nondestructive technique for vacancy defect investigation, was also developed and nuclearized in our hot cell laboratory as part of a project supported by the NOMADE and MATINEX research groups. Specific protocols for doped sample analysis were also developed and validated with UO(2) and (U, Pu)O(2) samples.

Passive and active non-destructive methods are well-adapted to this problem and their coupling can be extremely useful in order to optimize data analysis. Photon activation analysis (PAA), based on the photofission process and on the detection of delayed particles emitted after this reaction, is a powerful tool for the analysis of bulky concrete waste packages. Methods developed around PAA allow to locate, identify and quantify the mass of actinides ((235)U, (238)U, (239)Pu) present in a given package in order to estimate its alpha activity. In this article, we present experimental and simulated results obtained in PAA during the characterization of a real nuclear waste package in the SAPHIR facility (Active Photon and Irradiation System). For the first time, several non-destructive methods (passive gamma-ray spectrometry, high-energy radiography) are combined with traditional PAA techniques (altitude scan, global photofission, photofission tomography) in order to optimize the characterization process.

Monte Carlo Shielding Comparative Analysis Applied to TRIGA HEU and LEU Spent Fuel Transport	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Photon dose rates; shielding analysis; shipping cask; spent fuel transport; TRIGA HEU and LEU fuel		The paper is a comparative study of LEU and HEU fuel utilization effects for the shielding analysis during spent fuel transport. A comparison against the measured data for HEU spent fuel, available from the last stage of spent fuel repatriation fulfilled in the summer of 2008, is also presented. All geometrical and material data for the shipping cask were considered according to NAC-LWT Cask approved model. The shielding analysis estimates radiation doses to shipping cask wall surface, and in air at 1 m and 2 m, respectively, from the cask, by means of 3D Monte Carlo MORSE-SGC code. Before loading into the shipping cask, TRIGA spent fuel source terms and spent fuel parameters have been obtained by means of ORIGEN-S code. Both codes are included in ORNL's SCALE 5 programs package. The actinides contribution to total fuel radioactivity is very low in HEU spent fuel case, becoming 10 times greater in LEU spent fuel case. Dose rates for both HEU and LEU fuel contents are below regulatory limits, LEU spent fuel photon dose rates being greater than HEU ones. Comparison between HEU spent fuel theoretical and measured dose rates in selected measuring points shows a good agreement, calculated values being greater than the measured ones both to cask wall surface (about 34% relative difference) and in air at 1 m distance from cask surface (about 15% relative difference).

A Framework for the Solution of Inverse Radiation Transport Problems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Inverse problems; radiation detector; spectral analysis		Radiation sensing applications for SNM detection, identification, and characterization all face the same fundamental problem: each to varying degrees must infer the presence, identity, and configuration of a radiation source given a set of radiation signatures. This is a problem of inverse radiation transport: given the outcome of a measurement, what source terms and transport medium caused that observation? This paper presents a framework for solving inverse radiation transport problems, describes its essential components, and illustrates its features and performance. The framework implements an implicit solution to the inverse transport problem using deterministic neutron, electron, and photon transport calculations embedded in a Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear optimization solver. The solver finds the layer thicknesses of a one-dimensional transport model by minimizing the difference between the gamma spectrum calculated by deterministic transport and the measured gamma spectrum. The fit to the measured spectrum is a full-spectrum analysis-all spectral features are modeled, including photopeaks and continua from spontaneous and induced photon emissions. An example problem is solved by analyzing a high-resolution gamma spectrometry measurement of plutonium metal.

Noise-Adjusted Principal Component Analysis for Buried Radioactive Target Detection and Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Buried target detection; classification; Gammaray spectral analysis; noise-adjusted principal component analysis; principal component analysis		We present a noise-adjusted principal component analysis (NAPCA)-based approach to the detection and classification of buried radioactive targets with short sensor dwell time. The data used in the experiments is the gamma spectroscopy collected by a Sodium Iodide (NAI) scintillation detector. Spectral transformation methods are first applied to the data, followed by NAPCA. Then kappa-nearest neighbor (kappa NN) clustering is applied to the NAPCA-transformed feature subspace to achieve detection or classification. This method is evaluated using a database of 240 spectral measurements consisting of background (construction sand), benign material measurements (uranium ore), and target measurements (depleted uranium) at various depths. Compared to other widely used algorithms for depleted uranium, the proposed technique can provide better performance.

Neutron Detection via the Cherenkov Effect	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Cherenkov detectors; neutron activation; neutron detectors		We have incorporated neutron-absorbing elements in transparent, nonscintillating glasses and used the Cherenkov effect to convert neutron-induced beta-gamma radiation directly into light. Use of the Cherenkov effect requires glasses with a high index of refraction (to lower the threshold and increase the number of Cherenkov photons) and neutron absorbers resulting in radioactive products emitting high-energy beta or gamma radiation. In this paper, we present a brief description of the requirements for developing efficient Cherenkov-based neutron detectors, show the results of measurements of the response of representative samples to thermal and fast neutron fluxes, and give the results of a calculation of the expected response of a detector to a moderated fission spectrum.

Recent campaigns include Ti gettering, the installation of a set of internal flux rings, and RMF frequency scans. The Ti gettering campaign was successful, reduced impurities, and reduced deuterium recycling from the walls allowing density control and hotter FRCs [J.A. Grossnickle et al., Phys.

Activated carbon is selected because of its good adsorption performance at the cryogenic temperature. The carbon used in the present study is covered with mesopores or micropores from 1 to 10 nm in diameter. The adsorption and desorption of their respective gases proceed independently, and the desorption behavior of each component is well expressed in terms of a Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm. Since desorption curves under different heating conditions can be correlated to the same one on a (T-p(t)) plot, it is considered that gas desorption proceeds under equilibrium condition between the adsorbent and gaseous phases. Two- or three-component desorption of He, H-2, and CH4 from activated carbon can be described using an extended multicomponent Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm without any correction. Desorption curves calculated for their respective gases are in comparatively good agreement with experimental data.

After a cooling time of 12 years it's made of copper beam dump was cut and samples were taken for analytical purposes. The sampling collected about 500 g of high active copper chips that can be used for separation of exotic radionuclides. The analyses by gamma spectrometry, LSC and AMS showed main nuclides present to be Co-60, Mn-54, Na-22, Zn-65, Al-26, Mn-53, Ni-59, Ni-63, Fe-55 and Fe-60 and Ti-44 with a daughter nuclide Sc-44. In the frame of ERAWAST project a procedure combining selective precipitation and ion exchange for the separation of the rare radionuclides from the copper beam dump was developed. The proposed separation procedure is easy for remote controlled implementation in a hot cell. The ion exchange separation of Ni, Al, Mg, Ti and Fe was complete and high decontamination factors for copper and cobalt were achieved. Based on the developed procedure a remotely controlled system for separation of exotic radionuclides from the copper chips was set up. The full scale system was installed in a hot cell where high activity levels can be handled. In order to evaluate the reliability and functionality of the system extensive tests have been done. During the test period 13.86 g in total of the proton irradiated copper beam dump were processed for separation of Al-26, Ni-59, Mn-53, Ti-44 and Fe-60. The results showed that the system was operational and the radionuclide separation was selective with high chemical yield. The procedure manages as well the generated liquid wastes containing high level of Co-60 activity.

A combined radiochemical procedure that enables the simultaneous determination of some "difficult-to-measure" nuclides in medium and low level radioactive wastes has been developed in our laboratory. Recently, this method has been extended for determination of Np-237 and Zr-93. Np-237 and Zr-93 are pre-concentrated by co-precipitation on iron(II) hydroxide and zirconium oxide, separated by extraction chromatography using UTEVA, and measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). As even traces of polyatomic ions and isotopes at m/z 237 or 93 cause considerable interferences during ICP-MS detection, a purification step by extraction chromatography was needed. Analyzing real samples (evaporation concentrates of a nuclear power plant) 66-99% and 31-99% chemical yields were achieved for Np and Zr, respectively.

Thus, the study of U(VI) speciation in these solutions is of practical significance. The spectra of UO(2)(NO(3))(2) + Na(2)SO(4) solutions of different Phi(S) = [SO (4) (2-) ]/[U(VI)] ratio at pH = 2 were recorded for this purpose. As the presence of uranyl-nitrate complexes should be expected under these experimental conditions, the spectra of UO(2)(NO(3))(2) + NaNO(3) solutions with different Phi(N) = [NO (3) (-) ]/[U(VI)] ratio at pH = 2 were also measured. The effects of Phi(S) and Phi(N) ratios value were most pronounced in wavelength interval 380-500 nm. Therefore, these parts of experimental overall spectra were used for deconvolution into the spectra of individual species by the method proposed. It enabled to calculate stability constants of anticipated species at zero ionic strength. The Specific Ion Interaction Theory (SIT) was used for this purpose. Stability constants of UO(2)SO(4), UO(2)(SO(4)) (2) (2-) , UO(2)NO(3) (+) and UO(2)(NO(3))(2) coincided well with published data, but those for UO(2)(SO(4)) (3) (4-) and UO(2)(NO(3)) (3) (-) were significantly lower.

Arylesters of imidodiphosphoric, imidothiodiphosphoric, imidodithiodiphosphoric acids and tetraphenylimidodithiodiphosphine are used as representatives of bidentate organophosphoric extractants. From the group of tridentate agents, pentaphenyldiimidotriphosphate, was used. The extraction properties of tetraphenyl imidodiphosphates and their sulphur analogues for trivalent americium in 0.1 mol L-1 HNO3 into toluene also in the presence of tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) were investigated. The dependences of equilibrium ratios of the americium on analytical or equilibrium concentration of chelating agents, pH, initial concentration of nitric acid and initial concentration of TOPO were studied. The structures of the complexes in the organic phase were determined and the values of extraction constants were calculated. The extracted species were AmA(3), AmA(3) (HA), the addition of TOPO induced synergistic extraction of AmA(3) TOPO. The utilization of sulphur analogues was marginal.

The main part of the research is directed to the experimental results of bentonite and bentonite leachate samples obtained for the bentonite interaction under laboratory experiments. Computer-modeling methods were used to calculate equilibrium thermodynamic principles, the distributions of predominant aqueous species, and potential solubility controls for the environmentally important oxidation states of each investigated radioactive contaminants. The Eh-pH diagrams of individual chemical species of the tested radionuclides were calculated by the geochemical software tool Geochemist's Workbench that included the actual chemical compositions of the solid-liquid systems under the given experimental conditions. It was confirmed that smectites are transformed to more stable silicate phases, such as illite/smectite mixed layers, illite. The data obtained from the model calculations conform with experimental results. The effect of the variable aqueous phase composition on bentonite stability using Ca-Mg and Na-Ca bentonites for the experiments was studied. The synthetic granitic waters with the higher concentration of the K(+) and Mg(2+) cations were applied for the study of bentonite stability.

The typical gas production rates were 0.05-0.2 STP litre gas/day for CO(2) and CH(4) generation, and less for H(2). No explosive gas mixture was indicated in the L/ILW drums during the investigated storage period. Compositions of headspace gases in closed L/ILW vaults were in agreement with gas generation processes observed in L/ILW drums. The stable carbon isotope measurements show that the main source of the CO(2) gas is the degradation of organic matter and indicates microbial degradation processes as the main sources of CH(4). Typical tritium activity concentrations were < 10 Bq/l gas in the drums and < 1,000 Bq/l gas in the vaults.

An approach for acquiring data for description of diffusion in safety assessment of radioactive waste repositories	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Diffusion; Migration; Sorption; Waste repository	COMPACTED BENTONITE; CESIUM SORPTION; COEFFICIENTS; ADSORPTION; BATCH	Repositories for radioactive wastes are sited in the environment with very low permeability. One of the most important processes leading to the release of radionuclides to the environment is therefore diffusion of radionuclides in both natural and engineered barriers. Data for its description are crucial for the results of safety assessment of these repositories. They are obtained usually by comparison of the results of laboratory diffusion experiments with analytical and/or numerical solution of the diffusion equation with specified initial and boundary conditions. Results of the through-diffusion experiments are obviously evaluated by the "time-lag" method that needs for most of sorbing species unfortunately very long time of the experiment duration. In this paper a modified approach is proposed for the evaluation of diffusion data for safety assessment, which decreases the influence of propagation uncertainties using incorrect data and reduces time for acquiring data for safety assessment. This approach consist in the following steps: (i) experimental measurement of material diffusion parameters under various conditions using non-sorbing tritiated water or chlorine for which it is easy to reach conditions under which the "time-lag" method of evaluation of the result of the through-diffusion experiment is applicable-this step provides well established diffusion characteristics of materials for neutral species and anions, then (ii) to evaluate sorption isotherms for sorbing radionuclides from batch experiments under conditions corresponding to composition of material pore water, (iii) to assess the values of effective and apparent diffusion coefficients for sorbing radionuclides from well-defined diffusion coefficients of species in free water and (iv) to verify the obtained results using relatively short-term diffusion experiments with sorbing radionuclides, which will be evaluated using the time dependent decrease of the concentration in the input reservoir of the diffusion cell. A numerical model of the diffusion cell can model the decrease of concentration of species. The code, which we used for this type of evaluation of diffusion experiment, is based on the same approach to modelling that we use for modelling of the diffusion transport in performance assessment studies. The advantage of this approach consists in the compatibility of the approaches used for both evaluation and verification of the laboratory diffusion experiments and performance assessments and in considerable less time needed for experiments.

The surfaces of a type 304 stainless steel plate and of pipe waste sampled from the prototype advanced thermal reactor (Fugen) were dissolved in mixed acid solution (HNO(3):HCl:H(2)O = 1:1:4). The resulting solution was evaporated to dryness and dissolved with 2 mol/dm(3) of HNO(3) to prepare sample solutions. In order to analyze trivalent actinide elements in the sample solution containing a large amount of Fe(III) (> 0.1 g) using TRU resin, the effect of Fe(III) concentration on the recovery of Am(III) and reduction effect of Fe(III) to Fe(II) with ascorbic acid were studied. On the basis of results of this study, chemical separation scheme was constructed and Pu and Am in the sample solutions were separated. Thorium and U in the sample solutions were separated with UTEVA resin. High recoveries for all experimented elements were obtained from the analysis of spiked sample solutions, the effectiveness of the method was confirmed.

Characterization of Portuguese geomaterials, the clay component of raas, as potential liners for low and intermediate radioactive disposal sites	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Radioactive wastes; Rana deposits; Radiocaesium; FES; RIP	RADIOCESIUM; CESIUM; MONTMORILLONITE; SEDIMENTS; RETENTION; BEHAVIOR; BARRIERS; ILLITE; SOILS	Safety assessment of low and intermediate level waste (LILW) repositories requires the understanding of radionuclides sorption-desorption mechanisms, mainly the degree of interaction between radionuclides and mineral surfaces. Among the different radionuclides that are part of the Portuguese radwastes' inventory (137)Cs is one of the most important from the radiological point of view due to its high radiotoxicity. The clay component of natural geomaterials termed raas, originated from an area located in the NE Mainland of Portugal, was studied for their potential as effective barriers. These geomaterials (grains-size fractions < 63 mu m, < 36 mu m) were characterized in terms of cationic exchange capacity (CEC), frayed edge sites (FES) and radiocaesium interception potential (RIP). Organic matter content and pH were also determined. The fractions were mineralogically analyzed by X-ray diffraction and by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) for chemical elemental composition. Smectite (montmorilonite), illite, kaolinite were identified. The capacity of FES is related to the samples granulometry as opposed to what was observed for CEC and RIP. The behavior of raas was not similar for all samples which may be related to differences in mineralogy. Future studies with regard to the behaviour of radiocaesium are expected to clarify the possible application of these geomaterials as liner/backfill/buffer for a LILW repository.

Macro- and micro-scale studies on U(VI) immobilization in hardened cement paste	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Uranium; Cement; Micro-spectroscopy; Diffusion	RAY-ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY; SILICATE; DIFFUSION; IFEFFIT; BINDING; EXAFS	Wet chemistry and synchrotron-based (micro-)spectroscopic investigations have been carried out to determine the uptake and speciation of U(VI) in hardened cement paste (HCP). The wet chemistry experiments included kinetic studies and the determination of the sorption isotherm. The latter measurements allowed conditions for linear sorption to be distinguished from those where precipitation occurred. Micro-X-ray fluorescence and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (mu-XRF/XAS) were used to determine the elemental distribution and the coordination environment of U(VI) in an intact HCP sample at the atomic level. The sample was prepared by in-diffusion of U(VI) into HCP over 9 months. Micro-XRF maps revealed a heterogeneous distribution of U(VI) in a ten micron thick layer on the surface of the HCP disk. Micro-XAS measurements on a U(VI) hot spot showed that the coordination environment of U(VI) is similar to that in U(VI) doped HCP and in C-S-H sorption samples. To the best of our knowledge this is the first synchrotron-based micro-spectroscopic study on the speciation of diffusing uranyl ions with micro-scale spatial resolution.

Electro-fluid analysis of a molten-salt electrorefiner with rotating cruciform anode baskets	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Uranium; Molten-salt electrorefiner; Pyrochemical nuclear waste treatment; Multiphysics model; Computational fluid dynamics	FUEL	A computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based multiphysics model of a molten-salt electrorefiner is presented for the computational electro-fluid analysis. A target model of the electrorefining cell presented here has a structure arranged concentrically with the cathode annulus surrounding a rotating cruciform anode inside it. This comprehensive approach of a multiphysics model solves the convective and diffusive transport of ionic uranium and allows for a prediction of the concentration present in the LiCl-KCl eutectic electrolyte between the electrodes at a current driven condition. The coupling of the local overpotential distribution and uranium concentration gradient makes it possible to predict the local current density distribution at the electrode surfaces.	[Kim, K.

Study of thermal stability for tertiary pyridine ion exchange resin and anti-corrosion property of structural material toward eluents used in the advanced ORIENT cycle process	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Adv.-ORIENT Cycle; Actinide; Tertiary pyridine resin; Corrosion; Thermal stability	SEPARATION; ACTINIDES	A multi-functional separation process is proposed as one of the technologies for implementing the Adv.-ORIENT (Advanced Optimization by Recycling Instructive ElemeNTs) Cycle concept [1]. The tertiary pyridine-type anion exchange resin (TPR) embedded in silica beads (silica-supported TPR) was demonstrated suitable for the separation process of actinides from spent fuel. In this process, hydrochloric acid (HCl) and a mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and methanol (MeOH) are used as eluents. In order to apply this process to an engineering plant scale, two important issues must be evaluated to prove the system suitability. One is an environmental aspect represented by the use of HCl solution which is corrosive to many materials. The other is clarification of the reactive safety of silica-supported TPR and the HNO3-MeOH solvent mixture. Four types of metals, Ta, Zr, Nb, and Hastelloy-B (28%Mo-Ni) were selected as candidate materials which are anti-corrosive toward HCl. Corrosion experiments were conducted in HCl type simulated high level liquid waste (SHLLW) solution at room temperature for a maximum 720 h and at 90 A degrees C for 336 h. Ta showed an all-round anti-corrosion property in HCl type SHLLW solution, and Hastelloy-B was only acceptable at room temperature. Thermal analysis by differential scanning calorimetry was done to investigate the thermal stability of silica-supported TPR-NO3/MeOH/HNO3 mixtures. Heating experiment results on a gram scale were also obtained and evaluated to determine the conditions necessary to avoid runaway reactions. As a result, it was confirmed that a vigorous exothermic reaction can be avoided by controlled decrease of temperature.

Exhaustive electrolysis for recovery of actinides from molten LiCl-KCl using solid aluminium cathodes	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Exhaustive electrolysis; Electrochemistry in molten salt; Actinide-aluminium alloys; Spent nuclear fuel reprocessing; Pyrochemical reprocessing	ALLOY FUEL	An electrorefining process in molten chloride salts using solid aluminium cathodes is being developed in Institute for Transuranium Elements in order to separate actinides (An) from spent nuclear fuel. In this process, the fuel including fission products (FP) is dissolved into an electrolyte. Without purification of the salt, the process would have to be stopped when the FP concentration would become too high to allow a selective deposition of An on the cathode. Exhaustive electrolysis is proposed as the first purification step, consisting of a group-selective recovery of An on solid aluminium cathodes. On the anodic side, chlorine gas is produced by electrochemical decomposition of the salt. In order to prove the feasibility of the method, two galvanostatic electrolyses were carried out and the potentials of both electrodes were constantly monitored. Uranium was recovered from LiCl-KCl melts containing UCl(3) and a mixture of UCl(3)-NdCl(3), in which its concentration decreased from 1.7 to 0.1 wt% with no co-deposition of neodymium. Although the maximum applicable current densities were relatively low, the results are promising, demonstrating high current efficiency and selectivity of the proposed method. A design and application of a special chlorine gas producing inert anode is also discussed.

The method includes (1) tritium labeling of biomolecules by tritium thermal activation method and (2) scintillation phase step with organic phase, which can be concerned as a model of cellular membrane. Two globular proteins lysozyme and human serum albumin tested. We have determined the conditions of tritium labeling when labeled by-products can be easy separated by means of dialysis and size-exclusion chromatography. Scintillation phase experiments were conducted for three types of organic liquids. Thus, the influences of the nature of organic phase on proteins adsorption and its distribution in the bulk of aqueous/organic liquid system were determined. It was found that proteins possess high surface activity at aqueous/organic liquid interface. Furthermore, values of hydrophobicity of globular proteins were found by the experiment.

Traditional oil bath heating was compared to microwave heating. Various radioanalytical methods, radio-Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC), High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Mass Spectrometry (MS), were compared in the evaluation of the labelled product(s). The crude reaction mixture consisted of p-[F-18]MPPF and 2-4 radioactive by-products eluting after the product fraction, and the reverse-phase HPLC method failed occasionally to separate p-[F-18]MPPF from the radioactive by-product with close retention time. The heating method had no significant effect on the composition of labelled by-products. In LC-(ESI)-MS analysis of p-[F-18]MPPF the labelled product was identified with m/z ratio of 435 ([M + H+]). The other HPLC fractions were measured to have following m/z ratios: (1) 327; 349; (675) (2) 402; 407/408; (791) and (3) 436, suggesting different kind of decomposition of the labelled product and/or the inactive precursor. The ion trap mass spectrometer was sufficient for the qualitative analysis of p-[F-18]MPPF. However, differentiation of by-products arising from the decomposition of p-[F-18]MPPF or from its precursor p-MPPNO2 proved to be challenging.

TU-20 and its scFv were labeled with (125)I and (123)I by chloramine-T (with radiochemical yield 75 and 50%, respectively). Radiochemical purity and stability was revealed by gel filtration (decrease to 80 and 50% in 2 months, respectively). Immunoreactivity of the labeled TU-20 was determined by ELISA-the range of the preserved immunoreactivity varies from 60 to 95% in accordance to the used radiolabeling process. RIA and affinity coupling analytic methods were specifically designed with focusing on specifics of the antibody and its fragment. The results of RIA differ in depandance on the type of the reaction vessel (glass or polystyrene) and the affinity coupling results depend on the experimental arrangement-in the batch or on the column. Fragmentation of the labeled antibody and its fragment was estimated by bis-tris gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining and autoradiography (over 95% of radioactivity bound in the substances). The antibody binding in tissue slices was studied in vitro by immunohistochemistry. The Purkinje cells were observed conjugated with the radiolabeled substances, either TU-20 or its ScFv fragment in the area of the cerebellum. In vivo biodistribution of (125)I-TU-20, (125)I-scFv TU-20, (123)I-scFv TU-20 and Na(125)I was proceeded in normal mice (wild type C57B/6/J). Both biomolecules labeled by (123)I were also proved in an imaging biodistribution study with use of the SPECT camera. Finally, a transgene population G93A1 Gur was used for comparative study to show the different behaviour of the substances in a normal mouse and in the modified organism with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The most part of differences is observed in the area of the muscles, rostal and caudal spinal cord. In summary, the monoclonal antibody TU-20 and its scFv were successfully radioiodinated and afterwards analysed by several quality control methods and biodistribution studies which confirmed their preserved or expected immunoanalytical characteristics in normal and genetically modified organism.

Technology of DTPA and immunoglobulins conjugation and their attachment to Y-90 and Lu-177 radionuclides	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Immunoglobulin G; Y-90; Lu-177; Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid	ANTIBODIES; RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY; PROTEINS	The aim of the study of labeling of ligand-antibody conjugates was to find optimal conditions of preparing of these conjugates and appropriate radioactivity of selected nuclide for applications in nuclear medicine. Conjugation of the gamma-immunoglobulin G (human or bovine IgG, polyclonal antibodies) and bifunctional chelating agent, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid dianhydride (cDTPAA), was carried out. Various values of the cDTPAA/antibody ratio, the weight concentration of polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies (MEM-97) and buffers were used. Further, the labeling conditions of the DTPA-IgG conjugate by radionuclides Y-90 and Lu-177 were optimized, and the labeling yield and the conjugation ratio of prepared radionuclide-DTPA-IgG conjugates was determined. Optimal incubation time of the immunoglobulin conjugation was obtained at 30 min from mixing of individual components. The labeling yield of radionuclide-DTPA-antibody conjugate higher than 95% was achieved. Higher values of conjugation ratio of radionuclide-DTPA-antibody conjugate were achieved in 0.1 mol L-1 carbonate buffer, pH 8.5, and the 0.1 mol L-1 carbonate buffer is suitable for studied conjugation systems. This study showed that the labeling yield as well as the conjugation ratio of tested systems depend on the amount of antibody substance, bifunctional chelating agent/antibody molar ratio and pH value of the buffer used.

J	Pavelka, S				Pavelka, Stanislav			Radiometric enzyme assays: development of methods for extremely sensitive determination of types 1, 2 and 3 iodothyronine deiodinase enzyme activities	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Iodothyronine deiodinase; Radiometric assay; Thyroid hormone	ASTROGLIAL CELLS; INDUCTION	We elaborated novel, reliable radiometric methods for extremely sensitive determination of enzyme activities of iodothyronine deiodinases (IDs) of types 1, 2 and 3 in microsomal fractions of different rat and human tissues, as well as in homogenates of cultured mammalian cells. These radiometric enzyme assays were based on the use of high-specific-radioactivity I-125-labeled iodothyronines as substrates; TLC separation of radioactive products from the unconsumed substrates; film-less autoradiography of radiochromatograms using storage phosphor screens; and quantification of the separated compounds with a BAS-5000 laser scanner. This methodology enabled us to determine IDs enzyme activities as low as 10(-18) katals. The applicability of our sophisticated methods was demonstrated by following the alterations of IDs activities induced in cultured astroglial cells by a series of purinergic agonists, retinoic acid, and their combination. In addition, in case of ATP as a representative of purinergic agonists, we determined time-course and dose-response curves to characterize in more details the induction of each type of deiodinase by purines.

J	Pavelka, S				Pavelka, Stanislav			I-125-labelled iodothyronines: useful tools for studies of effects of an antidepressant drug fluoxetine in the rat	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Antidepressant drug; Radiometric enzyme assay; Thyroid hormone	THYROID-HORMONES; AUGMENTATION; DEPRESSION; LIVER	Thyroid hormones (TH) are supposed to control the activity of some neurotransmitters (e.g., serotonin), which are hypothetically involved in the pathogenesis of depressive illness. A new group of non-tricyclic antidepressant drugs includes selective serotonine re-uptake inhibitors. The most frequently used representative of this group is fluoxetine (Fluox). We followed in the present paper the effects of Fluox, administered subchronicaly (for 25 days) to Wistar rats by itself, or in combination with 3,3',5-triiodo-l-thyronine (T-3). In studies of the interaction of Fluox with the metabolism of TH, we applied adapted radiometric enzyme assays for iodothyronine sulfotransferases (ST) and uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronyltransferase (UDP-GT), as well as our newly developed radiometric assays for iodothyronine deiodinases (IDs) of types 1, 2 and 3 (D1, D2 and D3), using I-125-labelled iodothyronines of high specific radioactivity as substrates. We found about two-fold higher UDP-GT enzyme activities in samples of liver microsomes of rats treated with Fluox, in comparison with control rats. In contrast, the radiometric determination of ST activities in liver and kidney cytosolic fractions did not demonstrate any significant effects of the administration of Fluox, alone or together with T-3, on the induction of these enzymes. However, profound changes in enzyme activities were determined in case of IDs, especially in the pituitary and cerebellum of treated rats.

J	Haywood, SM				Haywood, S. M.			A method for displaying imprecision in early radiological emergency assessments	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article							RESPONSE ASSESSMENTS; MODEL	This paper presents an approach to estimating and displaying the imprecision associated with predictions from early emergency response calculations based on a limited number of off-site measurements and incomplete information about the nature of the release. The method enables key elements of imprecision to be included in the assessment in a simple and transparent manner, notably those arising from alternative weather evolutions, release durations, and factors influencing the amount of radioactivity deposited to ground. The presentation of assessment results incorporating lack of knowledge in a way that is easily understandable is important in the context of emergency decision making, and options for alternative styles of display are presented and discussed. A new system of early emergency response for radiological releases to atmosphere based on this approach is under development.

Therapeutic whole lung lavage for inhaled plutonium oxide revisited	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article							PULMONARY ALVEOLAR PROTEINOSIS; BRONCHOPULMONARY LAVAGE; RADIATION; EXPOSURE; WORKERS; PNEUMONITIS; BENEFITS; DISEASES; RISK	Two reviews in the last 12 years have differed widely in their indications for the use of whole lung lavage (WLL) to remove plutonium from the lung, one recommending its use at relatively low radiation doses to prevent stochastic effects and the other recommending restricting its use to high doses to prevent deterministic effects only. Since the publication of these reviews significant data have accumulated demonstrating the increased safety of WLL, and there are additional data on stochastic and deterministic effects. We discuss deterministic and stochastic risks and the practical aspects of undertaking WLL. We recommend that each case be assessed individually.	[Bingham, D.; Jones, D. M.; Lewis, N.

Radium isotopes in Estonian groundwater: measurements, analytical correlations, population dose and a proposal for a monitoring strategy	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article							VENDIAN AQUIFER SYSTEM; DRINKING-WATER; RADIOACTIVITY; RADIONUCLIDES; FINLAND; URANIUM; ORIGIN; WELLS	In some areas of Estonia, groundwater contains a significant number of natural radionuclides, especially radium isotopes, which may cause radiation protection concern depending on the geological structure of the aquifer. Indeed, the parametric value of 0.1 mSv y(-1) for the total indicative dose established by European Directive 98/83/EC, adopted as a limit value in Estonian national legislation, is often exceeded. A Twinning Project between Estonia and Italy was carried out within the framework of the Estonian Transition Facility Programme, sponsored by the European Union. Its aims were to assess the radiological situation of Estonian groundwater and related health consequences. The first step was a study of Estonian aqueducts and the population served by them, and a thorough analysis of the radiological database for drinking water, from which the relevant effective doses for the population were obtained. Particular attention was devoted to doses to children and infants. Correlations between the chemical parameters were investigated, in order to suggest the best possible analytical approach. Lastly, a monitoring strategy, i.e. sampling points and sampling frequencies, was proposed.

The results achieved, using the SNAP (spectral non-destructive assay platform) system, were generally within a few per cent of the true activities and gave confidence in the ability to allocate wastes to the correct categories in accordance with national legislation. This is important for reasons of public safety and also for minimisation of the amount of RSA (Radioactive Substances Act) Exempt material categorised as LLW (low level waste) as the UK's LLW storage capacity diminishes.

In the proposed methodology, the height and the number of assemblies were scaled down based, respectively, on the integral scaling criteria by Ishii and Kataoka (1984) for a natural-circulation loop under single phase flow and on the concept of an insulator on the surface of the basket. The controlling scaling parameters for the TN24P cask (the scaling ratio of the heat flux, 1.6; the thickness and conductivity of the insulator, 9 mm and 0.05 W/m K, respectively) were estimated by comparing the results of a TN24P cask experiment (Creer et al., 1987) with those of a CFD simulation of a TN24P cask scaled down, using Fluent code. Based on the proposed scaling methodology and its scaling parameters. a thermal-hydraulic experiment with a half-height single assembly was carried out. The experiment was analyzed in comparison with a CFD simulation to validate the proposed CFD models in Fluent code. The results showed good agreement for the peak cladding temperature (215 degrees C from the experiment, 212 degrees C from the CFD). It is regarded that the proposed scaling methodology was reasonably validated as maintaining the similarity of the temperature gradient and the peak cladding temperature. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

After re-canalized for four weeks, tissue specimens from bilateral nasolacrimal ducts are obtained, and the Bcl-2 and Bax protein expression levels are evaluated by immunohistochemical staining analysis. Comparing with the blank control, the expression levels of the Bcl-2 and Bax in the nasolacrimal duct stenosis and the mechanical probing are significantly up-/down-regulated (p<0.05), but in the I-125 radioactive probing are down-/up-regulated (p<0.05) and can be used to re-canalize the stenostic lacrimal passage.

The fabricated MOX fuels were instrumented with temperature and pressure gauges that enabled one to measure the fuel temperature and rod internal pressure online. An irradiation test in the Halden reactor was performed to investigate the in-pile behavior of the fabricated MOX fuel. The irradiation of 1020 effective full-power days was successfully accomplished with good integrity of the test fuel rods. The rod average burnup reached 50 MWd/kg HM, and the measured fuel centerline temperature was similar to 1000 degrees C for the MOX fuels. A significant fission gas release was observed due to the high power level. The online measured in-pile performance data of the two attrition-milled MOX fuel rods were analyzed and compared with the fuel performance code COSMOS. COSMOS simulated the fuel centerline temperature and rod internal pressure for both MOX fuel rods. The analysis by COSMOS showed good agreement with the online measured in-pile behavior of MOX fuel.

This paper suggests a new method as a dechlorination approach to the immobilization of salt waste. The inorganic composite consists of SiO(2), Al(2)O(3), and P(2)O(5) (SAP), which can generate a series of reactive sites for metal chlorides when in contact with molten salt. Under an oxidative condition, metal chlorides were successfully dechlorinated and converted into metal aluminosilicate, metal aluminophosphate, and metal orthophosphate, which are manageable at a high temperature. The optimum mixing ratio of SAP/salt in weight is about 2, and a borosilicate glass shows good compatibility with the reaction products containing phosphate compounds. By using a glass, a highly monolithic waste form was successfully fabricated at 1100 degrees C, and more than 33 wt% of mixing ratio of glass as a chemical binder increased the chemical durability of the waste form. Use of SAP as an effective stabilizer can offer a chance to avoid Cl-induced problems and control the vaporization of volatile elements. This allows a high degree of freedom in the fabrication of monolithic waste form.

The objective is to reduce the treatment time for deep-seated brain tumors to similar to 1 h. The paper describes the optimal SCM design and two optimal beam-shaping assemblies (BSAs)-one designed to maximize the dose rate and the other designed to maximize the total dose that can be delivered to a deep-seated tumor. The neutron beam intensity amplification achieved with the optimized SCM and BSA results in an increase in the treatment dose rate by a factor of 18: from 0.56 Gy/h without the SCM to 10.1 Gy/h. The entire SCM is encased in an aluminum structure. The total amount of 20% enriched uranium required for the SCM is 8.5 kg, and the cost (not including fabrication) is estimated to be less than $60,000. The SCM power level is estimated at 400 W when driven by a 1012 n/s D-D neutron source. This translates into consumption of only similar to 0.6% of the initially loaded (235)U atoms during 50 years of continuous operation and implies that the SCM could operate continuously for the entire lifetime of the facility without refueling. Cooling the SCM does not pose a challenge; it may be accomplished by natural circulation as the maximum heat flux is only 0.034 W/cm(2).
