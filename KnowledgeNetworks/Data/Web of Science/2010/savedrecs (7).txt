Safety analysis of irradiated RBMK-1500 nuclear fuel transportation in newly developed container	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Topical Meeting on High Temperature Reactor Technology	SEP 28-OCT 01, 2008	Washington, DC				SPENT-FUEL	Ignalina NPP (Lithuania) comprises two Units with RBMK-1500 reactors. After the Unit 1 of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant was shut down in 2004, approximately 1000 fuel assemblies from Unit 1 were available for further reuse in Unit 2. The fuel-transportation container, vehicle, protection shaft and other necessary equipment were designed in order to implement the process for on-site transportation of Unit 1 fuel for reuse in the Unit 2. The developed equipment can be used also in decommissioning phase for fuel transportation to fuel storage facilities. The set of this equipment can be applied for NPPs with RBMK type reactors. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the content and main results of safety analysis, focusing attention on the container used for spent fuel transportation. The structural integrity, thermal, radiological and nuclear criticality safety calculations are performed to assess the acceptance of the proposed set of equipment. The safety analysis demonstrated that the proposed nuclear fuel-transportation container and other equipment are in compliance with functional, design and regulatory requirements, assure the required safety level for both normal operation and accident conditions and can be used for fuel transportation.

J	Yang, YH; Kang, DW; Lee, GB				Yang, Yang-Hee; Kang, Duk-Won; Lee, Gab-Bock			Evaluation of C-14 release characteristics in Korean standard pressurized water reactor	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Topical Meeting on High Temperature Reactor Technology	SEP 28-OCT 01, 2008	Washington, DC					This paper focuses on evaluation of the characteristics of organic and inrganic C-14, which is purged to the environment via purge line of each building in Korean standard reactor. C-14 has a half-life of 5730 years and emits pure beta rays. C-14 is a radioactive element that is easily transferred to the environment and has considerable environmental biological effects. According to recent research, organic C-14 compounds are produced in reactor coolants via deoxidizing pathways. However, in oxidizing conditions, C-14 changes to an oxidized carbon form and finally to (CO2)-C-14. The radioactivity in purge lines and the purged quantity of organic and inorganic C-14 in each building at Yonggwang #5unit were measured and evaluated during the three-year period from 2006 to 2008. During normal operation the annual purge quantity is about 100 GBq/GWe-yr, lower than the annual purge quantity in European pressurized water reactors. During normal operation inorganic C-14 shows a higher purge rate than organic C-14 in the purge line. During the outage period, the purge of C-14 shows a slightly higher rate than the purge rate in normal operation. In Korean standard reactors the portion of C-14 in inorganic chemical form is higher than those in foreign nuclear power plants, and this is attributable to operation characteristics such as volume control tank purge operation during normal operation. From the evaluation of the purge quantity through the purge line, it was found that considerable C-14 was purged to the environment via the fuel handling building. This evaluation study will provide useful information for establishing radiocarbon (C-14) control policy and for purge management. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Yun, H; Mi, X; Kan, W				Yun, Hu; Mi, Xu; Kan, Wang			Study on integrated TRU multi-recycling in sodium cooled fast reactor CDFR	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Topical Meeting on High Temperature Reactor Technology	SEP 28-OCT 01, 2008	Washington, DC					In view of recently proposed closed fuel cycle strategy which would recycle the integrated transuranics (TRU) from PWR spent fuel in the fast reactors, the neutronics characteristics of TRU recycled in China Demonstration Fast Reactor (CDFR) are studied in this paper. The results show that loading integrated TRU to substitute pure Pu as driver fuel will mainly make the influence on sodium void worth and negligible effects on other parameters, and hence TRU recycling in CDFR is feasible from viewpoint of core neutronics. If TRU is multi-recycled, the variation of TRU composition depends on fuel types and the ratio of TRU and U when recycling. It is indicated that, when TRU is multi-recycled in CDFR with MOX fuel, the minor actinides (MA) fraction in TRU will firstly decrease to similar to 7.24% (minimum) within 8 TRU recycle times and then slowly increase to similar to 7.7% after 20 TRU recycle times; while when TRU is multi-recycled in CDFR with metal fuel (TRU-U-10Zr), the MA fraction in TRU will gradually approach to an equilibrium state with the MA fraction of similar to 3.8%, demonstrating better MA transmutation effect in metal fuel core. No matter 7.7 or 3.8%, they are both lower than similar to 10% in PWR spent fuel with burnup of 45 GWd/tU, which presents satisfying effect of MA amount controlling for TRU multi-recycling strategy. On the other hand, the corresponding recycling parameters such as TRU heat release and neutron emission rate are also much lower in metal fuel than those in MOX fuel. Moreover, TRU recycled in metal fuel will bring greater fissile Pu isotopes equilibrium fraction due to better breeding capability of metal fuel. Finally, it could be summarized that integrated TRU multi-recycling in fast reactor can make contributions to both breeding and transmutation, and such strategy is a prospective closed fuel cycle manner to achieve the object of effective control of cumulated MA amount and sustainable development of nuclear energy.

This study is to find an environmental-friendly process to treat theses spent resins. The test samples were prepared by diluting the slurry made by wet ball milling the spent cationic exchange resins for 24 h. The spent cationic exchange resins were separated from mixed ion exchange resins by a fluidized bed gravimetric separator. The decomposition of the samples was investigated with super-critical water oxidation (SCWO) equipment. A statistical test method the central composite design as a statistical design of experiments was adopted to find the optimum condition to decompose the spent exchange resins. The optimum condition was 60% of excess oxygen, 22.5 min of residence time, 0.615 wt% of NaOH, 358 of reaction temperature, and 3600 psi of reaction pressure, which is a sub-critical condition. The liquid product of the decomposition has the characteristics of 80-185 ppm of COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand), 4.0-6.0 of pH, and <1.0 ppm of corrosive components (Ni, Fe, Cr, and Mo). The exhaust gas from the SCWO equipment contained NOx of 0 ppm, SOx of 3 ppm (environment exhaust standard in Korea: NOx 200 ppm, SOx 300 ppm). Co-substituted mock samples were prepared to simulate spent cationic exchange resins from nuclear power plants which can contain radioactive Co isotopes. The conditions to obtain organic compound destruction ratio which conforms the effluent stand for the mock samples were found. The treated water filtered with 0.2-filter contained less than 1 ppm of Co. Thus Co recovery rate of more 99% was achieved. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Levy, S				Levy, Salomon			Need for USA high level waste (HLW) alternate geological repository (AGR) and for a different methodology to enhance its acceptance	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Topical Meeting on High Temperature Reactor Technology	SEP 28-OCT 01, 2008	Washington, DC					In early February 2010, the administration stopped work and withdrew the Department of Energy (DOE) application for a construction permit for the Yucca Mountain geological repository from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Also, a "blue ribbon" Commission was appointed to explore alternatives for storage, processing, and disposal, including evaluation of advanced fuel cycles and to provide a final report in 24 months. That decision, however, failed to recognize that: (1) the U.S. will need an early alternate geological repository (AGR) for its HLW irrespective of the findings of the "blue ribbon" Commission; (2) the once-through spent fuel inventory from commercial nuclear power reactors will continue to rise and so will the damages against the government for its failure to remove spent fuel from reactors sites, as specified in contracts; (3) there are prepackaged DOE and nuclear weapons HLW ready for shipment to a repository which must be taken into account because of government penalties for failure to do so; (4) the current Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) needs to be modified to allow the early search and approval of Alternate Geological Repository (AGR) and for an interim centralized HLW storage facility to reduce government liabilities; and (5) the methodology used to license Yucca Mountain needs to undergo serious modifications, including a different non-politicized management and siting credo. This paper reviews and discusses all the preceding shortcomings and proposes significant changes to pursue AGR as soon as possible and to get site approval by the NRC first under a formal, stepwise, well-structured risk-informed decision approach as recommended by the (National Academy, 2001).

J	Dennis, ML; Usman, S				Dennis, Matthew L.; Usman, Shoaib			Feasibility of Ru-106 peak measurement for MOX fuel burnup analysis	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Topical Meeting on High Temperature Reactor Technology	SEP 28-OCT 01, 2008	Washington, DC					Simulations were performed using ORIGEN-ARP to investigate Cs-137 and Ru-106-Rh-106 as suitable fission products for non-destructive analysis of irradiated MOX. The simulations confirm that both Cs-137 and Ru-106 will provide a linear correlation with burnup when exclusively applied to MOX fuel assemblies. Moreover, Ru-106 can also be used in conjunction with cesium to form a ratio almost independent of enrichment and power history. Simulations were conducted using three different uranium enrichments and one MOX enrichment over a burnup range of 20,000-60,000 MWD/MTHM. Comparison of the three uranium enrichments indicates the Ru-106 ratio is consistent in predicting burnup with a maximum standard deviation of 0.046. Two MOX cases were simulated confirming operational history independence of Ru-106 in predicting total burnup. The Ru-106 burnup ratio also has the benefit of enabling distinction between UO2 and MOX fuel because of its significantly larger (similar to 11 times) fission yield from Pu-239. To investigate the detectability of Ru-106 and other cesium peaks, data was collected using a HPGe detector at the Missouri S&T nuclear reactor (MS&TR) beam port. Gamma spectra were obtained immediately following reactor shutdown with the most promising spectrums obtained 3-5 h after shutdown. Even for relatively high enrichment (similar to 20%) fuel at MS&TR, cesium peaks were prominent and easily discernable from the intense Compton continuum. The Ru-106 peak was weak, though still distinguishable from the background, suggesting that with an appropriately designed collimator, suitable detector and electronics it might be feasible to reliably measure Ru-106 in even UO2 fuel. For MOX and LEU LWR fuels one would expect a more intense Ru-106 signature. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Sorption characteristics of an economical sorbent material used for removal radioisotopes of cesium and europium	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Radiotracer method; Europium; Cesium; Sorption; Sawdust; Kinetics; Thermodynamics	SAWDUST ACTIVATED CARBON; DARK COLORED COMPOUNDS; HEAVY-METAL IONS; AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; SURFACE-CHEMISTRY; METHYLENE-BLUE; WOOD SAWDUST; PINE SAWDUST; WASTE-WATER; ADSORPTION	Application study for the evaluation of sorption characteristics of sawdust as an economical sorbent material used for decontamination of radioisotopes cesium and europium from aqueous solution has been carried out in the present work. In this respect, sawdust (untreated and treated by HNO(3)) has been prepared from the commercial processing of wood for furniture production. Pore properties of the activated carbon such as BET surface area, pore volume, pore size distribution, and pore diameter were characterized by N(2) adsorption and DFT software. Radiotracer method onto sawdust from aqueous solutions was studied in a batch technique with respect to pH, contact time, temperature. The kinetics of adsorption of Eu(3+) and Cs(+) have been discussed using five kinetic models namely, pseudo-first-order model, pseudo-second-order model, Elovich equation, intraparticle diffusion model, and modified Freundlich equation that have been tested in order to analysis the experimental data. Kinetic parameters and correlation coefficients were determined. It was shown that the second-order kinetic equation could describe the sorption kinetics for two metal ions. The metal uptake process was found to be controlled by intraparticle diffusion.

Uptake behavior of titanium molybdophosphate for cesium and strontium	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Cesium; Strontium; Titanium molybdophosphate; Uptake; Breakthrough	COMPOSITE ION-EXCHANGER; RADIOACTIVE CESIUM; WASTE SOLUTIONS; REMOVAL; SORPTION; COBALT; SR-90; WATER; SODIUM	This study investigates uptake of cesium and strontium from aqueous solution similar to nuclear waste on three samples of titanium molybdophosphate (TMP) synthesized under various conditions. Effects of concentration of sodium nitrate, pH and contact time on the uptake of cesium and strontium have been studied by bath method. The results showed that TMP has high affinity toward cesium and strontium at pH > 2 and relatively low concentration of sodium nitrate. Kinetic data indicated that cesium uptake process to achieve equilibrium was faster than strontium. Cesium and strontium breakthrough curves were examined at 25 A degrees C using column packed with H(3)O(+) form of TMP and breakthrough curves showed symmetrical S-shaped profiles. At the same time, the calculated breakthrough capacity for cesium was higher than strontium. The results of desorption studies showed that over 99% of cesium and strontium was washed out of column by using 4 M NH(4)Cl solution. This study suggests that TMP can have great potential applications for the removal of strontium and specially cesium from nuclear waste solution.	[Yavari, R.; Huang, Y. D.; Ahmadi, S.

MCNPX Monte Carlo burnup simulations of the isotope correlation experiments in the NPP Obrigheim	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						MCNPX; Burnup; Isotope correlation experiment	CROSS-SECTION	This paper describes the simulation work of the Isotope Correlation Experiment (ICE) using the MCNPX Monte Carlo computer code package. The Monte Carlo simulation results are compared with the ICE-Experimental measurements for burnup up to 30 GWD/t. The comparison shows the good capabilities of the MCNPX computer code package for predicting the depletion of the uranium fuel and the buildup of the plutonium isotopes in a PWR thermal reactor. The Monte Carlo simulation results show also good agreements with the experimental data for calculating several long-lived and stable fission products. However, for the americium and curium actinides, it is difficult to judge the predication capabilities for these actinides due to the large uncertainties in the ICE-Experimental data. In the MCNPX numerical simulations, a pin cell model is utilized to simulate the fuel lattice of the nuclear power reactor. Temperature dependent libraries based on JEFF3.1 nuclear data files are utilized for the calculations.

In the Monte Carlo depletion approach, the McCARD multi-cycle core depletion calculation was performed up to an equilibrium cycle, involving a great details of core geometry and material inventory. ORIGEN-2 performs only the decay cooling calculation with the full scope of ORIGEN-2 nuclides inventory provided by the McCARD depletion calculation. The accuracy of the decay heat analysis procedure developed in the previous work by using HELIOS and ORIGEN-2 codes was also verified. The HELIOS/ORIGEN-2 procedure showed a good accuracy for a short period of cooling time. However, a relatively large discrepancy between the two was observed for a long period of cooling time. As expected, the decay heat of a TRU fueled DB-MHR core was much higher than that of uranium fueled PMR200 core due to the fuel composition difference, which means that more attention for effective removal of the decay heat should be paid in designing the TRU fueled deep burn cores to ensure the safety of the deep burn core during the conduction cooling events.

The reactor used for the study was the IAEA's 10 MW benchmark reactor. Simulations were carried out to calculate core excess reactivity, neutron flux spectrum, prompt neutron generation time and effective delayed neutron fraction. Nuclear reactor analysis codes including WIMS-D4 and CITATION were employed to carry out these calculations. It was observed that in comparison with the beginning-of-life values, at end-of-life, the neutron flux increased throughout the core, the prompt neutron generation time increased by 3.68% while the effective delayed neutron fraction decreased by 0.35%.

The possibility of a fully automated procedure for radiosynthesis of fluorine-18-labeled fluoromisonidazole using a simplified single, neutral alumina column purification procedure	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						[(18)F]FMISO; Neutral-alumina purification; Non-radioactive impurities; NITTP	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; TUMOR HYPOXIA; PET; F-18; MARKERS; FLUORINE-18-FLUOROMISONIDAZOLE; RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS; PRECURSOR; ONCOLOGY; CANCER	A novel fully automated radiosynthesis procedure for [(18)F]Fluoromisonidazole using a simple alumina cartridge-column for purification instead of conventionally used semi-preparative HPLC was developed. [(18)F]FMISO was prepared via a one-pot, two-step synthesis procedure using a modified nuclear interface synthesis module. Nucleophilic fluorination of the precursor molecule 1-(2'-nitro-1'-imidazolyl)-2-O-tetrahydropyranyl-3-O-toluenesulphonylpropanediol (NITTP) with no-carrier added [(18)F]fluoride followed by hydrolysis of the protecting group with 1 M HCl. Purification was carried out using a single neutral alumina cartridge-column instead of semi-preparative HPLC. The maximum overall radiochemical yield obtained was 37.49 +/- 1.68% with 10 mg NITTP (n=3, without any decay correction) and the total synthesis time was 40 +/- 1 min. The radiochemical purity was greater than 95% and the product was devoid of other chemical impurities including residual aluminum and acetonitrile. The biodistribution study in fibrosarcoma tumor model showed maximum uptake in tumor, 2 h post injection. Finally, PET/CT imaging studies in normal healthy rabbit, showed clear uptake in the organs involved in the metabolic process of MISO. No bone uptake was observed excluding the presence of free [(18)F]fluoride. The reported method can be easily adapted in any commercial FDG synthesis module. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Kilislioglu, A; Aras, G				Kilislioglu, Ayben; Aras, Gozde			Adsorption of uranium from aqueous solution on heat and acid treated sepiolites	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Sepiolite; Adsorption; Uranium; Acidic treatment; Porosity; Surface area	SORPTION; KINETICS	In this work adsorption of uranium on natural, heat and acid treated sepiolite was studied. For acid treatment HCl and H(2)SO(4) were used separately. Heat and acid treatment caused some, changes in sepiolite such as surface area, micropore volume (cm(3)/g) and average pore diameter (A). Different amounts of Mg ions were extracted from the lattice depending on the type of acid. After acid treatment with MCl, the amount of Mg left in the sepiolite changed a little. During H(2)SO(4) treatment the sepiolite structure was progressively transformed into amorphous silica. These heat and acid treatments changed adsorption capacity and mechanism of uranium on sepiolite. Data obtained from the adsorption experiments were applied to Langmuir and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) adsorption isotherms. Using these isotherms different adsorption capacities were found for natural and treated sepiolite samples. The capacity values were 3.58 x 10(-3), 3.14 x 10(-3), 2.78 x 10(-3) and 1.55 x 10(-3) mol/g for HCl treated, heat treated, natural and H(2)SO(4) treated sepiolite samples, respectively. In order to evaluate the adsorption mechanism adsorption energies were calculated by the D-R isotherm. According to the adsorption energy values uranium fixed to the natural and heat treated sepiolite surface with ion exchange (12.75 and 12.12 kJ/mol, respectively).

Evaluation of heat generation by radioactive decay of sedimentary rocks in Eastern Desert and Nile Valley, Egypt	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Gamma-ray spectrometry; Heat-producing; Sedimentary rocks	GAMMA-RAY SPECTROMETRY; NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; FLOW; FERTILIZERS; ELEMENTS; PROFILE; CRUST; ARC	Radioactive heat-production (RHP) data of sedimentary outcrops in Gebel Anz (Eastern Desert) and Gebel Sarai (Nile Valley) are presented. A total of 103 rock samples were investigated, covering all major rock types of the areas. RHP were derived from uranium, thorium and potassium concentrations measured from gamma-radiation originating from the decay of (214)Bi ((238)U series), (208)Tl ((232)Th series) and the primary decay of (40)K, obtained with a Nat (Tl) detector. The heat-production rate of Gebel Anz ranges from 0.94 (Nubai Sandstone) to 5.22 mu W M(-3) (Duwi Formation). In Gebel Sarai it varies from 0.82 (Esna Shale) to 7 mu W m(-3) (Duwi Formation). The contribution due to U is about 62%, from Th is 34% and 4% from K in Gebel Anz. The corresponding values in Gebel Sarai are 69.6%, 26.9% and 3.5%, respectively. These data can be used to discuss the effects of the lateral variation of the RHP rate on the heat flux and the temperature fields in the upper crust. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ASSESSMENT OF COLLATERAL EFFECTS OF THERMO-OXIDATION ON DIII-D IN-VESSEL COMPONENTS IN PREPARATION FOR IN SITU OXIDATION IN DIII-D	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						thermo-oxidation; tritium removal; carbon codeposits	C-D-LAYERS; DEUTERATED CARBON-FILMS; TOKAMAK CODEPOSITS; HYDROGEN RELEASE; D DIVERTOR; REMOVAL; EROSION; OXYGEN; TILES; DEPENDENCE	Carbon-based codeposits formed in carbon-containing fusion devices have the potential to dominate tritium retention in the torus. One of the tritium removal techniques currently being studied is thermo-oxidation, which is unique in its ability to remove tritium from codeposits without mechanical intervention in the torus and in its ability to remove tritium from codeposits in tile gaps and shaded areas. In preparation for an oxidation experiment planned to be performed in DIII-D, we have investigated the potential collateral effects of thermo-oxidation on DIII-D in-vessel components. Laboratory oxidation experiments were performed at 2 Torr (similar to 270 Pa) and 15 Torr (similar to 2 kPa) O(2) pressure and temperatures in the range 100 to 350 degrees C (373 to 623 K) for 2 to 8 h. After oxidation, components were examined for visual or mechanical change, and when appropriate, mass changes were also obtained. In some cases, optical diagnostics were also performed. The specimens were mostly spare/surplus components and spanned a wide variety of materials and functions, e.g., cryopump components; structural, mechanical, and diagnostic components; and fast-wave antennas. The effect of oxidation was found to be negligible for nearly all DIII-D components and materials tested.	[Fitzpatrick, B. W. N.; Davis, J. W.; Haasz, A. A.; McLean, A. G.; Stangeby, P.

STUDY OF JET SOFT HOUSEKEEPING WASTE TREATMENT BY PLASMA ARC CENTRIFUGE COMBUSTION AND GASIFICATION IN COUNTERCURRENT REGIME	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						tritium-contaminated waste; waste incineration products; polychlorinated dibenzodioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDF)	TRITIUM; POLYETHYLENE; POLYSTYRENE; PYROLYSIS; CHLORINE; EXPOSURE; KINETICS; GAS	Maintenance of the Joint European Torus (JET) reactor led to generation of soft housekeeping materials contaminated with tritium and comprising various polymeric materials. Some of the wastes fall into the category of intermediate-level waste and require processing to reduce the volume and/or change the category to low-level waste. Plasma arc centrifuge (PAC) combustion and countercurrent regime of gasification have been studied as candidates for a future waste treatment facility for JET tritium-contaminated wastes. This study was carried out for JET wastes that did not contain tritium. Mass reduction factors from 8 to 46 and from 35 to 143 for countercurrent regime of gasification and PAC combustion, respectively, have been demonstrated to be dependent on waste composition. Volume reduction factors from 20 to 100 and from 95 to 400 for countercurrent regime of gasification and PAC combustion, respectively, have been also estimated to be dependent on waste composition. The wastes and combustion products including chlorine-containing combustion products have been characterized using standard procedures and various analytical procedures developed for this study. The formation of water as a secondary waste was estimated for countercurrent regime of gasification, which was important for the ultimate processing of tritium-contaminated wastes.	[Bernstein, L.

ASDEX Upgrade Team	INTEGRATED DATA ANALYSIS OF PROFILE DIAGNOSTICS AT ASDEX UPGRADE	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						integrated data analysis; ASDEX Upgrade; Bayesian probability theory	FUSION	A major challenge in nuclear fusion research is the coherent combination of measurements from heterogeneous diagnostics. Different measurement techniques for measuring the same subset of physical parameters provide complementary and redundant data for, e.g., improving the reliability of physical parameters, increasing the spatial and temporal resolution of profiles, and resolving data inconsistencies. The concept of integrated data analysis within the framework of Bayesian probability theory was applied to the combined analysis of lithium beam emission spectroscopy (LIB), deuterium cyanide laser interferometry, electron cyclotron emission (ECE), and Thomson scattering spectroscopy. The four heterogeneous diagnostics enable the simultaneous estimation of electron density and temperature profiles with high spatial and temporal resolution. The coherent analysis of the profile diagnostics allows one to consider diagnostic interdependencies correlating density and temperature profiles, e.g., ECE shine-through, and diagnostics alignment. The benefits of a combined analysis of diagnostics will be shown in a modular way by successively increasing the set of diagnostics starting with the LIB diagnostics.	[Fischer, R.; Fuchs, C.

A MOBILE BIOASSAY LABORATORY FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL DOSES BASED ON IN VIVO AND IN VITRO MEASUREMENTS	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						accidents; handling; bioassay; dosimetry; internal; monitoring; personnel		Internal exposures may occur in nuclear power plants, radioisotope production, and in medicine and research laboratories. Such practices require quick response in case of accidents of a wide range of magnitudes. This work presents the design and calibration of a mobile laboratory for the assessment of accidents involving workers and the population as well as for routine monitoring. The system was set up in a truck with internal dimensions of 3.30m x 1.60m x 1.70m and can identify photon emitters in the energy range of 100-3,000 keV in the whole body, organs, and in urine. A thyroid monitor consisting of a lead-collimated NaI(Tl)3 '' x 3 '' (7.62 x 7.62 cm) detector was calibrated with a neck-thyroid phantom developed at the IRD (Instituto de Radioprotecao e Dosimetria). Whole body measurements were performed with a NaI(Tl)8 '' x 4 '' (20.32 x 10.16 cm) detector calibrated with a plastic-bottle phantom. Urine samples were measured with another NaI(Tl)3 '' x 3 '' (7.62 x 7.62 cm) detector set up in a steel support. Standard solutions were provided by the National Laboratory for Metrology of Ionizing Radiation of the IRD. Urine measurements are based on a calibration of efficiency vs. energy for standard volumes. Detection limits were converted to minimum committed effective doses for the radionuclides of interest using standard biokinetic and dosimetric models in order to evaluate the applicability and limitations of the system. Sensitivities for high-energy activation and fission products show that the system is suitable for use in emergency and routine monitoring of individuals under risk of internal exposure by such radionuclides.

QUANTITATIVE PLUTONIUM MICRODISTRIBUTION IN BONE TISSUE OF VERTEBRA FROM A MAYAK WORKER	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						exposure; occupational; plutonium; radiation; alpha; skeleton	NEUTRON-INDUCED AUTORADIOGRAPHY; ORGAN DISTRIBUTION; FALLOUT PLUTONIUM; PU-239; BEAGLES; RETENTION; INDUCTION; SKELETON	The purpose of this study was to obtain quantitative data on plutonium microdistribution in different structural elements of human bone tissue for local dose assessment and dosimetric models validation. A sample of the thoracic vertebra was obtained from a former Mayak worker with a rather high plutonium burden. Additional information was obtained on occupational and exposure history, medical history, and measured plutonium content in organs. Plutonium was detected in bone sections from its fission tracks in polycarbonate film using neutron-induced autoradiography. Quantitative analysis of randomly selected microscopic fields on one of the autoradiographs was performed. Data included fission fragment tracks in different bone tissue and surface areas. Quantitative information on plutonium microdistribution in human bone tissue was obtained for the first time. From these data, the quantitative relationships of plutonium decays in bone volume to decays on bone surface in cortical and trabecular fractions were defined as 2.0 and 0.4, correspondingly. The measured quantitative relationship of decays in bone volume to decays on bone surface does not coincide with recommended models for the cortical bone fraction by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. Biokinetic model parameters of extrapulmonary compartments might need to be adjusted after expansion of the data set on quantitative plutonium microdistribution in other bone types in humans as well as other cases with different exposure patterns and types of plutonium.

A PHYSIOLOGICAL SKELETAL MODEL FOR RADIONUCLIDE AND STABLE ELEMENT BIOKINETICS IN CHILDREN AND ADULTS	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						bones; human; dose; bone; intake; radionuclide; internal dose	TRABECULAR BONE; DOSE COEFFICIENTS; KINETIC-MODEL; CORTICAL BONE; PLUTONIUM; RADIATION; CALCIUM; RETENTION; DOSIMETRY; SURFACES	A physiological skeletal model (PSM) is described that represents the skeletal uptake, retention, and clearance of both bone-surface-seeking and bone-volume-seeking radionuclides and stable elements. A key objective of the PSM is to model the higher skeletal growth and bone turnover in infants and children (compared to adults) in order to account for their greater uptake and cancer risk from bone-seeking contaminants such as lead and plutonium. The PSM is a compartmental model that allows for the incorporation of organic and inorganic material in the bone volume via quiescent bone surfaces, forming bone surfaces and the lacuno-canaliculi system. The model uniquely incorporates a tertiary phase of mineralization via bone fluids. The PSM's structural concepts and biokinetic parameters-such as realistic mass transfers, organ and tissue masses, and bone remodeling half-times-are selected mainly on the basis of physiological and anatomical criteria. For brevity, model parameter values are evaluated for adults only. The PSM is an improvement on existing skeletal models that are based more on compartment structures and pathways that rendered good fits to biokinetic data rather than on being anatomically and physiologically accurate.

Surgical excisions in the week following reduced the long-term residual wound activity to 5.4 kBq, and 164 DTPA chelation therapy administrations over 17 mo resulted in urinary excretion of about 7 kBq. The case was published in 1988, but now 24 y of follow-up data are available. Annual bioassays have included in-vivo measurements of Am-241 in the wound, skeleton, liver, lung, and axillary lymph nodes, and urinalyses for plutonium and Am-241. These measurements have shown relatively stable levels of Am-241 at the wound site, with gradually increasing amounts of Am-241 detected in the skeleton. Liver measurements have shown erratic detection of Am-241, and the lung measurements indicate Am-241 but as interference from activity in the axillary lymph nodes and skeleton rather than activity in the lung. Urine excretion of (239)+Pu-240 since termination of chelation therapy has typically ranged from 10 to 20 mBq d(-1), with Am-241 excretion about 10% of that for Pu239+240. Annual routine medical exams have not identified any adverse health effects associated with the intake.

Recent miner epidemiological studies, which include low levels of exposure, long duration of follow-up, and good quality of individual exposure data, suggest higher risks of lung cancer per unit exposure than assumed previously by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). Although risks can be managed by controlling exposures, dose estimates are required for the control of occupational exposures and are also useful for comparing sources of public exposure. Currently, ICRP calculates doses from radon and its progeny using dose conversion factors from exposure (WLM) to dose (mSv) based on miner epidemiological studies, referred to as the epidemiological approach. Revision of these dose conversion factors using risk estimates based on the most recent epidemiological data gives values that are in good agreement with the results of calculations using ICRP biokinetic and dosimetric models, the dosimetric approach. ICRP now proposes to treat radon progeny in the same way as other radionuclides and to publish dose coefficients calculated using models, for use within the ICRP system of protection.

INTEGRATION OF UNCERTAINTIES INTO INTERNAL CONTAMINATION MONITORING	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						computer calculations; contamination; internal; effective dose; plutonium	IDEAS GUIDELINES; DOSIMETRY	Potential internal contaminations of workers are monitored by periodic bioassays interpreted in terms of intake and committed effective dose through biokinetic and dosimetric models. After a prospective evaluation of exposure at a workplace, a suitable monitoring program can be defined by the choice of measurement techniques and frequency of measurements. However, the actual conditions of exposure are usually not well defined and the measurements are subject to errors. In this study we took into consideration the uncertainties associated with a routine monitoring program in order to evaluate the minimum intake and dose detectable for a given level of confidence. Major sources of uncertainty are the contamination time, the size distribution and absorption into blood of the incorporated particles, and the measurement errors. Different assumptions may be applied to model uncertain knowledge, which lead to different statistical approaches. The available information is modeled here by classical or Bayesian probability distributions. These techniques are implemented in the OPSCI software under development. This methodology was applied to the monitoring program of workers in charge of plutonium purification at the AREVA NC reprocessing facility (La Hague, France). A sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the important parameters for the minimum detectable dose. The methods presented here may be used for assessment of any other routine monitoring program through the comparison of the minimum detectable dose for a given confidence level with dose constraints.

THREE PLUTONIUM CHELATION CASES AT LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						chelation; dose assessment; exposure; occupational; plutonium	THERAPY	Chelation treatments with dosages of 1 g of either Ca-DTPA (Trisodium calcium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate) or Zn-DTPA (Trisodium zinc diethylenetriaminepentaacetate) were undertaken at Los Alamos Occupational Medicine in three recent cases of wounds contaminated with metallic forms of Pu-239. All cases were finger punctures, and each chelation injection contained the same dosage of DTPA. One subject was treated only once, while the other two received multiple injections. Additional measurements of wound, urine, and excised tissues were taken for one of the cases. These additional measurements served to improve the estimate of the efficacy of the chelation treatment. The efficacy of the chelation treatments was compared for the three cases. Results were interpreted using models, and useful heuristics for estimating the intake amount and final committed doses were presented. In spite of significant differences in the treatments and in the estimated intake amounts and doses amongst the three cases, a difference of four orders of magnitude was observed between the highest excretion data point and the values observed at about 100 d for all cases. Differences between efficacies of Zn-DTPA and Ca-DTPA could not be observed in this study. An efficacy factor of about 50 was observed for a chelation treatment, which was administered at about 1.5 y after the incident, though the corresponding averted dose was very small (LA-UR 09-02934).

CASE STUDY: THREE ACUTE Am-241 INHALATION EXPOSURES WITH DTPA THERAPY	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						Am-241; bioassay; dosimetry; internal; inhalation	URINARY-EXCRETION; PLUTONIUM	Three workers incurred inhalation exposures to Am-241 oxide as a result of waste sorting and compaction activities. The exposure magnitudes were not fully recognized until the following day when an in-vivo lung count identified a significant lung deposition of Am-241 in a male worker, and DTPA chelation therapy was initiated. Two additional workers (one female and one male) were then identified as sufficiently exposed to also warrant therapy. In-vivo bioassay measurements were performed over the ensuing 6 mo to quantify the Am-241 activity in the lungs, liver, and skeleton. Urine and fecal samples were collected and showed readily detectable Am-241. Clinical lab tests and medical evaluations all showed normal results. There were no significant adverse clinical health effects from the therapy. The estimated Am-241 inhalation intakes for the three workers were 1,800 Bq, 630 Bq, and 150 Bq. Lung retention showed somewhat longer pulmonary clearance half-times than standard inhalation class W or absorption Type M assumptions. The three subjects underwent slightly different therapy regimens, with therapy effectiveness factors (defined as the ratio of the reference doses without therapy relative to the final assessed doses) of 4.5, 1.9, and 1.7, respectively.

The decorporation prevents accumulation in organs and results in a dosimetric benefit, which is difficult to quantify from bioassay data using existing models. The development of a biokinetic model describing the mechanisms of actinide decorporation by administration of DTPA was initiated as a task in the European COordinated Network on RAdiation Dosimetry (CONRAD). The systemic biokinetic model from Leggett et al. and the biokinetic model for DTPA compounds of International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication 53 were the starting points. A new model for biokinetics of administered DTPA based on physiological interpretation of C-14-labeled DTPA studies from literature was proposed by the group. Plutonium and DTPA biokinetics were modeled separately. The systems were connected by means of a second order kinetics process describing the chelation process of plutonium atoms and DTPA molecules to Pu-DTPA complexes. It was assumed that chelation only occurs in the blood and in systemic compartment ST0 (representing rapid turnover soft tissues), and that Pu-DTPA complexes and administered forms of DTPA share the same biokinetic behavior. First applications of the CONRAD approach showed that the enhancement of plutonium urinary excretion after administration of DTPA was strongly influenced by the chelation rate constant. Setting it to a high value resulted in a good fit to the observed data. However, the model was not yet satisfactory since the effects of repeated DTPA administration in a short time period cannot be predicted in a realistic way. In order to introduce more physiological knowledge into the model several questions still have to be answered. Further detailed studies of human contamination cases and experimental data will be needed in order to address these issues.

STRUCTURE OF A SINGLE MODEL TO DESCRIBE PLUTONIUM AND AMERICIUM DECORPORATION BY DTPA TREATMENTS	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						Am-241; biokinetics; modeling; biological; pharmacokinetics	CA-DTPA; ZN-DTPA; INHALATION; RAT; CONTAMINATION; RETENTION; THERAPY; PUO2; BIOKINETICS; SPECIATION	The aim of this study is to propose a single modeling structure to describe both plutonium and americium decorporation by DTPA, which is based on hypotheses mostly validated by experimental data. Decorporation efficacy of extracellular retention depends on the concentration ratio of DTPA vs. actinides and varies in each compartment according to the amount of biological ligands and their affinity for actinides. By contrast, because the relatively long residence time of DTPA after its cell internalization and the stability of actinide-DTPA complexes, intracellular decorporation efficacy is mainly controlled by a DTPA/actinide ratio, which is specific to each retention compartment. Although the affinity of DTPA is much lower for americium than for plutonium, a larger decorporation of americium can be obtained, which is explained by different biological ligands and/or their affinity for the actinide. Altogether, these results show that the relative contribution of intra vs. extracellular decorporation varies depending on the actinide, the chemical form of radionuclides, the galenic formulation of DTPA, and the treatment schedule.

A CASE OF WOUND INTAKE OF PLUTONIUM ISOTOPES AND Am-241 IN A HUMAN: APPLICATION AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE NCRP WOUND MODEL	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						Am-241; biokinetics; modeling; dose assessment; plutonium	PARTICLES	Plutonium isotopes (Pu-239 and Pu-238, and Am-241) with a total activity of 269 kBq were accidentally deposited in a puncture wound of the right index finger of a nuclear worker at the Mayak Production Association. Tissues surrounding the wound site contaminated with radionuclides were excised 4.5 h after the injury. Residual contamination within the wound amounted to 0.05% of the initial contamination. The 10-d therapy with CaNa3-diethylene triamine pentaacetate acid (CaNa3-DTPA) was performed in parallel with in vivo measurements of the wound site and daily urine bioassays. The wound intake of radionuclides was consistent with two forms of radioactive materials detected within the wound site, i.e., soluble compounds and a large fragment, which was completely removed by excision. On day 9 after the injury, the clearance rate from the wound site was 1.8 times higher than the rate predicted by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) model for soluble compounds of plutonium and americium. The NCRP model parameters of transfer rates from the colloid and intermediate state (CIS) into soluble, and particles, aggregates and bound state (PABS) compartments were modified to eliminate any difference. As a result, a difference between the observed wound site radionuclide content and the value predicted by the modified wound model did not exceed 14% up to 9 days after the injury. For a longer period from 7 to 24 months, the value predicted by the modified model was consistent with results of the corresponding in vivo measurements. The treatment reduced the effective dose (50 years) from internal exposure by at least 480 times. The dose estimated (without accounting for a contribution of exposure dose to the regional lymph nodes draining the wound site) did not exceed 11 mSv.

This software will allow them to have a rapid dosimetric assessment in the event of a skin contamination by radioactive particles and will help them in their diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. A standardized data sheet was created allowing the exhaustive collection of adequate information in order to evaluate the skin dose. The selection of appropriate monitoring equipment with a 1 cm(2) detector, depending on the place and on the surface of the contaminated area, will allow the evaluation and the quantification of the surface activities. A tool has been made as a software package, named Cutadose (R), allowing the assessment of the skin dose in situ as well as the efficacy of the prescribed therapy.

J	Klein, W; Breustedt, B; Urban, M				Klein, Wolfgang; Breustedt, Bastian; Urban, Manfred			ANALYSIS OF THE VARIABILITY OF BIOKINETIC MODEL PARAMETERS DUE TO INTER-INDIVIDUAL VARIATION	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						bioassay; biokinetics; biostatistics; Monte Carlo	ICRPS DOSE COEFFICIENTS; PLUTONIUM EXCRETION; URINARY-EXCRETION; RELIABILITY; UNCERTAINTY; MEMBERS	Biokinetic models for the assessment of individual internal doses represent the physiological processes of a standardized human, which affect the internal distribution of the radionuclide of interest. The flow from one compartment into another is specified by transfer rates, which may vary from person to person. The rate constants are then representing the mean values for the population as a whole, around which individual parameters fluctuate according to given probability densities. Analytical distribution propagation can be calculated only for very simple models. The influence of inter-individual variation can be studied with Monte Carlo simulations, which compare the simulated compartment content distributions using different initial distributions for the parameters. The simulations indicate that the form of test distributions affect the distributions of compartment contents only for very simple models in the early stages. Later on, the distributions converge to a lognormal shape. The coefficients of variation of the initial distributions can be adjusted so that the resulting distributions resemble each other. Due to the lack of significant differences, lognormal distributions-which are found in most measurable body parameters-were used for further studies. The range of inter-subject variability can be estimated by comparing data generated with Monte Carlo simulations with observed data. For the plutonium model, data retrieved long times post intake are most suitable for this purpose when the redistribution of the radionuclide in the compartments is in a state of quasi-equilibrium and the ratio of plutonium in different compartments is nearly constant. For the estimation of inter-individual variability, the ratios of the main excretion paths and the organs of main burden can be used. The comparison of observed and simulated standard deviations indicates a value of 0.6 for the coefficient of variation for all transfer rates. The generated distributions show good agreement with the available data and thus confirm that the simulations can represent the inter-individual variation in the biokinetic plutonium model.

Comparison of 3D OS-EM and 4D MAP-RBI-EM Reconstruction Algorithms for Cardiac Motion Abnormality Classification Using a Motion Observer	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Cardiac motion observer; motion abnormality classification; myocardial perfusion SPECT	MYOCARDIAL-PERFUSION; IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION; GATED SPECT; EMISSION; COMPENSATION; TOMOGRAPHY; PHANTOM; MODELS; HEART; CT	Using a heart motion observer, we compared the performance of two image reconstruction techniques, a 3D OS-EM algorithm with post Butterworth spatial filtering and a 4D MAP-RBI-EM algorithm. The task was to classify gated myocardial perfusion (GMP) SPECT images of beating hearts with or without regional motion abnormalities. Noise-free simulated GMP SPECT projection data was generated from two 4D NCAT beating heart phantom models, one with normal motion and the other with a 50% motion defect in a pie-shaped wedge region-of-interest (ROI) in the anterior-lateral left ventricular wall. The projection data were scaled to the clinical GMP SPECT count level before Poisson noise was simulated to generate 40 noise realizations. The noise-free and noisy projection data were reconstructed using the two reconstruction algorithms, parameters chosen to optimize the tradeoff between image bias and noise. As a motion observer, a 3D motion estimation method previously developed was applied to estimate the radial motion on the ROI from two adjacent gates. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were computed for radial motion magnitudes corresponding to each reconstruction technique. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated as an index for classification of regional motion. The reconstructed images with better bias and noise tradeoff were found to offer better classification for hearts with or without regional motion defects. The 3D cardiac motion estimation algorithm, serving as a heart motion observer, was better able to distinguish the abnormal from the normal regional motion in GMP SPECT images obtained from the 4D MAP-RBI-EM algorithm than from the 3D OS-EM algorithm with post Butterworth spatial filtering.

The liquid scintillation detector used in this system enables the easy preparation of sources without self-absorption. A special beta-beta coincidence technique is implemented to suppress large thermal and electronic noises, resulting in a higher coincidence efficiency and reduced uncertainty in the measurements of low-energy beta-emitting radionuclides. The system is commissioned with the activity measurement of (60)Co. The measured activity is derived with 90% efficiency for the beta-ray detection.	[Lee, K.

Reactor Neutrino Detection for Non-Proliferation With the NUCIFER Experiment	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Advancements in Nuclear Instrumentation, Measurement Methods and their Applications (ANIMMA 2009)	JUN 07-10, 2009	Marseilles, FRANCE	IEEE NPSS		Detection; neutrino; reactor; safeguard	FISSION-PRODUCTS; POWER OUTPUT	The major advances achieved over the last decades in the understanding of fundamental neutrino physics allow us to apply the detection of reactor antineutrino signals to automatic and nonintrusive nuclear power plant surveys. Here, we present the NUCIFER experiment, a 1-ton Gd-doped liquid scintillator detector to be installed a few 10 m from a reactor core for measurements of its thermal power and plutonium (Pu) content. The design of such a small volume detector has been focused on high detection efficiency (similar to 50% and good background rejection. Detailed simulations of reactor-emitted antineutrino spectrum and detector response have been developed and used to calculate the NUCIFER sensitivity to illicit retrieval of Pu from the core. These results have been presented in October 2008 to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has expressed its interest in the potentialities of this detector as a new safeguard tool.

Many neutron detectors are plagued by large backgrounds from X-rays and gamma rays, and most current neutron detectors lack single-event energy sensitivity or any information on neutron directionality. Even the best detectors are limited by cosmic ray neutron backgrounds. All applications would benefit from improved neutron detection sensitivity and improved measurements of neutron properties. Here, we show data from a new type of detector that can be used to determine neutron flux, energy distribution, and direction of neutron motion. The detector is free of backgrounds from X-rays, gamma rays, beta particles, and relativistic singly charged particles. It is relatively insensitive to cosmic ray neutrons because of their distinctive angular and energy distributions. It is sensitive to thermal neutrons, fission spectrum neutrons, and high-energy neutrons, with detection features distinctive for each energy range. It is capable of determining the location of a source of fission neutrons based on characteristics of elastic scattering of neutrons by helium nuclei. A portable detector could identify 1 g of reactor grade plutonium 1 m away with less than 1 min of observation time.

Depth Determination of Buried Caesium-137 and Cobalt-60 Sources Using Scatter Peak Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Advancements in Nuclear Instrumentation, Measurement Methods and their Applications (ANIMMA 2009)	JUN 07-10, 2009	Marseilles, FRANCE	IEEE NPSS		Gamma distributions; gamma rays; nuclear measurements; radioactive pollution		An investigation into an alternative approach to 3-D source mapping is proposed by combining the insights of two existing techniques. The first of these is a 3-D "imaging" tool, N-Visage, that has been developed by REACT Engineering, Ltd. (Whitehaven, U. K.). This technique is efficient and robust, but is not a true 3-D technique as it relies on user-supplied 2-D manifolds to constrain source locations. The second technique uses the gamma-photopeak and an X-ray peak to determine radionuclide source depth using a relative attenuation method. We look at the possibility of combining both techniques to constrain both the location and depth of a radiological source buried under shielding. It is believed a combined method using spectra recorded above the shielding object will be of use in the nuclear decommissioning and land contamination industries. N-Visage has previously been used to map source distributions of mixed radionuclides with complex geometries through shielding media. The software works by producing a computer model that recreates the experimental setup. A survey is imported, comprising a set of gamma-spectra recorded with an instrument of known efficiency and isotropy taken at a variety of locations around the area of interest. A survey plan recording the location and orientation of the instrument for each reading is also reconstructed. N-Visage is then able to determine the locations of the source(s) without prior knowledge of exactly where they are located, by building and inverting a simple physical model relating potential source locations to the recorded spectra. This research sets out to investigate the possibility of combining the geometric insights of N-Visage with a method of extracting depth information from scatter data, rather than the X-ray peak. By combining the gamma-photopeak and scatter areas of a spectrum, the thickness of the shielding media between source and detector can potentially be inferred. Using scattered photons rather than X-ray attenuation is preferable where depths are of a sufficient thickness to effectively eliminate a measurable X-ray photopeak.

In k(0)-standardized NAA (k(0)-NAA), it is possible to correct for this effect through the introduction of k(0)-fission factors. In this work, the aim was to determine the feasibility of k(0)-NAA as a screening technique for accurate and isotopic ratio determination (we further refer to the technique as k(0)-UNAA) and where k(0)-UNAA could be positioned versus the other screening techniques. In k(0)-UNAA, we use an adapted formalism to determine the n(U-235)/n(U-238)-ratio. Several swipe samples spiked with different isotopic ratios were analyzed and demonstrate the feasibility of k(0)-UNAA as a accurate and reliable screening method for the quantification of environmental samples up to several tens of ng. At these levels the uranium concentration can be quantified with a reasonable uncertainty and reliable n(U-235)/n(U-238) isotopic ratio analysis could also be performed.

Smoothing Low Resolution Gamma Spectra	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Bias; spectral analysis; variance smoothing		The energy spectra of gamma-rays emitted by radioisotopes act as finger prints that enable identification of the source. Such identification from low-resolution NaI detectors over short time periods is challenging for several reasons, including the Poisson fluctuations in the recorded counts. Smoothing the data over neighboring energy bins can reduce the noise in the raw counts, at the cost of introducing a bias that de-emphasizes the peaks and valleys of a spectrum. This paper describes a new two-stage smoothing procedure that uses a multiplicative bias correction (MBC) for adjusting initial smoothed spectra. Applying the MBC to an initial smoother reduces bias of the initial smoother in the peaks and valleys with no or negligible increase in its variance. We illustrate the benefit of this new method on example real and simulated spectra.

The ASIC aims for the readout of strip or pixel (pad) detectors utilizing silicon and cadmium telluride (CdTe) as detector materials. Each readout channel includes a charge-sensitive amplifier, bandpass filters and a sample-and-hold circuit. It also includes a leakage current compensation and pole-zero cancellation circuits to meet the various detector requirements. The equivalent noise level of a typical channel reaches 89 @ 0 pF (rms) and shows an input-capacitance characteristic of 7.5 c(-)/pF between 0 pF and 10 pF with a power consumption of 3 mW per channel. We mounted the ASIC on a low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) package and evaluated the spectral performance by combining with a CdTe diode detector. As a result, the gamma-ray spectrum of radioactive source (241) Am was obtained with a good energy resolution of 2.23 keV (FWHM) for gamma rays of 59.5 keV at 20 degrees C.

The produced N-13 is a short-lived radioisotope with a half-life of 9.97 min and threshold energy of 0.28 MeV.

TRISO fuel because of capable of high burn up and very neutronic performance is conducted in a D-T fusion driven hybrid reactor. In this study, TRISO fuels particles are imbedded body-centered cubic (BCC) in a graphite matrix with a volume fraction of 68%. The neutronic effect of TRISO coated LWR spent fuel in the fuel rod used hybrid reactor on the fuel performance has been investigated for Flibe, Flinabe and Li(20)Sn(80) coolants. The reactor operation time with the different first neutron wall loads is 24 months. Neutron transport calculations are evaluated by using XSDRNPM/SCALE 5 codes with 238 group cross section library. The effect of TRISO coated LWR spent fuel in the fuel rod used hybrid reactor on tritium breeding (TBR), energy multiplication (M), fissile fuel breeding, average burn up values are comparatively investigated. It is shown that the high burn up can be achieved with TRISO fuel in the hybrid reactor.

Based on the test data obtained in the CABRI test reactor and nuclear safety research reactor, the model takes into account the effect of the five parameters: pellet average burnup, peak fuel enthalpy, the ratio of peak fuel enthalpy to pulse width, fission gas release during base-irradiation, and grain size of a fuel pellet. The parametric study of the model, producing a physically reasonable trend of FGR for each parameter, shows that the pellet average burnup and the ratio of peak fuel enthalpy to pulse width are two of the most important parameters. Depending on the combination of input values for the five parameters, the application of the model to a fuel rod under typical RIA conditions of light water reactor produces 1.7-14.0% of FGR for the pellet average burnup ranging from 20 to 70 MW d/kg U.

Removal of the deposition on JT-60 tile by nano-sec pulsed-laser irradiation	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							REDEPOSITION LAYERS; TRITIUM REMOVAL; SCANNING LASER; GRAPHITE TILE; CARBON TILES; CO-DEPOSITS; ABLATION; DETRITIATION; CODEPOSITS; RETENTION	To clarify the property of tritium removal from carbon codeposition by using pulsed-laser induced desorption, hydrogen removal from co-deposits on JT-60 divertor tile using a fourth-harmonic emission (266 nm) of a nano-sec Nd:YAG laser was demonstrated. The threshold laser fluence for ablation was similar to 0.3 J/cm(2), which was slightly higher compared to that of the pico-sec laser irradiation. The energy absorption coefficient for the nano-sec laser, which was obtained by fitting the removal rate by so-called Beer's law, was larger than the pico-sec laser. Since the time constant of thermal wave propagation into the target is of the order of nano-sec, such differences between nano- and pico-sec lasers could be attributed to thermal effects. The ablation threshold of the deposited layer was lower than that of a pure graphite, which could be attributed to the difference of thermal conductivity between deposited layer and pure graphite. The removal rate of the nano-sec laser was higher than that of pico-sec laser in the fluence range of >similar to 0.5 J/cm(2). On the other hand, the production ratio [hydrocarbon species]/[H-2] continuously increased with the laser fluence, and no significant ionization of carbon was observed in this fluence range. This indicated that the fluence range in this study was "weak"-ablation range, which was still not sufficient to minimize the hydrocarbon production. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Meiliza, Y; Saito, M; Sagara, H				Meiliza, Yoshitalia; Saito, Masaki; Sagara, Hiroshi			Denaturing Generated Pu in Fast Breeder Reactor Blanket	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						protected Pu production; denaturing Pu; proliferation resistance; FBR; fuel cycle; minor actinides; multicycle	PLUTONIUM	Protected Pu production (P-3) is a recently developed concept to enhance the proliferation resistance properties of Pu by increasing the fraction of even-mass-number Pu isotopes thus leading to the denaturing of Pu. The present paper deals with the possibility of denaturing Pu by consideration of Pu and minor actinides (MAs) multicycling in medium-size fast breeder reactors (FBRs). It was found that multicycling of Pu and MAs in FBRs enhances the proliferation resistance of Pu by increasing the fraction of even-mass-number Pu isotopes. The proliferation resistance of Pu in P-3 recycling options satisfied criteria based on Kessler's proposal, i.e., 6% Pu-238 content, and Pellaud's proposal, i.e., 30% Pu-240 content. The normalized attractiveness of Pu in P-3 recycling options satisfied both criteria in the core as well as in the blanket with the combination of even-mass-number Pu isotopes. At the initial introduction, two P-3 FBRs (714 MWth class) with the addition of 5 wt% MA into the blanket can be operated using the annual discharged spent fuel in Japan.

Thick Target Yields (TTYs), obtained irradiating both thick metal W targets of natural isotopic composition and highly enriched powdered (186)W targets, were measured at different particles energies taking into account high accuracy and precision. The evaluation of radionuclidic purities of (186g)Re obtained activating highly enriched (186)W by both p and d were also carried out and accurately compared. The thin-target excitation functions for all Re (A = 181, 182, 183, 184, 186 and their metastable levels), and W and Ta coproduced radionuclides will be presented elsewhere in deep details.

In this method, first, uranium (IV) is determined using fiber optic aided spectrophotometry then same solution is used for determination of free acidity and hydrazine. Free acid is titrated with standard sodium carbonate solution after uranium (IV) is masked with EDTA. Once the end point for the free acid is determined at pH 3.0, an aliquot of formaldehyde is added to liberate the acid equivalent to hydrazine which is then titrated with the same standard sodium carbonate solution using an automatic titration system. The described method is simple, accurate and reproducible. The overall recovery of uranium (IV), nitric acid and hydrazine is 98% with 3% relative standard deviation respectively. The major advantage of the method is that it uses sodium carbonate a primary standard as titrant and generation of corrosive analytical wastes containing oxalate or sulphate is avoided. Valuable metals like uranium and plutonium can easily be recovered from analytical waste before final disposal.
