Neutron induced background gamma activity in low-level Ge-spectroscopy systems	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Low background gamma spectroscopy; Muon induced neutrons; Neutron capture and inelastic scattering in Ge; Lead and iron shield	RAY SPECTROMETER; PRODUCTION RATES; RADIOACTIVITY	Two high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors were located in two different passive shields: one in pre-WW II iron and the second in commercial low background lead. Gamma lines emitted after neutron capture, as well as after inelastic scattering on the germanium crystal were detected and then analyzed. The thermal and fast neutron fluxes were calculated and their values were compared for the two different kinds of detector shield. Several materials having different neutron slowing-down properties were packed in Marinelli geometry, positioned on the lead shielded detector and measured for around 10(6) s. The main goal was to estimate a possible influence of the sample on the intensity of the neutron induced Ge gamma lines. On the iron-shielded detector a massive (3 in. thick) Nal Compton suppression system showed a measurable activity from neutron capture and inelastic scattering on sodium and iodine nuclei.

In the framework of a project aiming to establish an unattended measurement station at isotope enrichment facilities (Lebrun, 2007) [1], a study was carried out to describe the state-of-the-art of non-destructive assay methods applicable to UF6 cylinders. The objective of the present work is to provide a feasibility assessment study of all known NDA techniques applicable to the quantitative verification of all uranium categories involved in an enrichment processing plant. Based on this investigation, the most appropriate techniques were then investigated for suitability of use in an unattended measurement station. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Transmission measurements of guides for ultra-cold neutrons using UCN capture activation analysis of vanadium	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Ultra-cold neutrons; Neutron guides; Transmission; UCN detection	SOLID DEUTERIUM SOURCE; REACTOR; MIRRORS; TUBES	The efficient transport of ultra-cold neutrons (UCN) from their source to the experimental site is a major issue for various kinds of precision experiments. Neutron guides often have to transport the UCN several tens of meters with acceptable losses. In order to qualify the guides, their UCN transmission properties have to be determined with high precision. For this purpose we have developed a novel method. The transmitted UCN were absorbed at the end of the guide in a vanadium disc producing the beta-emitter V-52 (half life 3.74 min). The intensity of the 1434 keV gamma-ray following the P-decay was measured. UCN guides of non-magnetic nickel alloys made by the replication technique were studied. They show a high Fermi pseudopotential V-F for UCN and a low surface roughness. For these guides the transmission per meter was determined with a relative error of +/- 0.6%, resulting in values above 0.95/m. By an absolute calibration of the gamma-ray detection system we also deduced the absolute value of the UCN current absorbed in the vanadium plate. Possible applications of this method are discussed.

Measuring total reaction cross-sections at energies near the coulomb barrier by the active target method	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Heavy ions; Total reaction cross-section; Active target; Microchannel plate	NUCLEAR-REACTION PROBABILITIES; SCATTERING; SILICON; HE-3; SI	An experimental technique is described that is able to measure reaction cross-sections at energies around the Coulomb barrier by using low intensity beams and a Si detector as an active target. Set-up optimization was carefully investigated in terms of collimation, detector efficiency and pile-up rejection. The method has been tested by measuring the total reaction cross-section sigma(R)(E) for the (7)Li + (28)Si system in the energy range of E(lab) = 12-16 MeV. The deduced excitation function sigma(R)(E) agrees with the data obtained in a previous experiment. The presented technique can also be applied in order to determine total reaction cross-sections for low intensity radioactive beams at energies around the Coulomb barrier. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The decrease in measured magnetic flux density at the center of the magnets were 0.6%, 6.9%, 25.2% and 47.3% after continuous irradiation of 1.1 kGy, 3.7 kGy, 5.6 kGy and 7.4 kGy, respectively. On the other hand, the decrease due to non-continuous irradiation, in which the magnet was first irradiated at 3.7 kGy, then irradiated again at 3.7 kGy nine months later, was 14% smaller than that of continuous irradiation, even for the same total dose. The temperature coefficient of the magnetization did not change with irradiation. Some radioactive materials, such as (147)Nd, (151)Pm, and (54)Mn, were detected in the magnet after irradiation.

J	Ganda, F; Greenspan, E				Ganda, Francesco; Greenspan, Ehud			Analysis of Reactivity Coefficients of Hydride-Fueled PWR Cores	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article								A thorough investigation was performed to understand the physics behind the calculated trends in the reactivity coefficients of hydride-fueled pressurized water reactor cores. A two-step procedure was developed for this purpose: ranking the contribution to a reactivity coefficient of each of the system's constituents; investigating, for each of the more important constituents, the spectral reasons for their specific response to the temperature perturbation. This procedure was applied to understand (a) the difference in the beginning-of-life and end-of-life fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity, (FTC) behavior of hydride- as compared to oxide-fueled cores; (b) the different effect integral fuel burnable absorber (IFBA) and erbium burnable poisons have on the FTC and coolant temperature coefficient of reactivity (CTC); (c) the effects on the FTC and CTC of inclusion of thorium hydride in the fuel; (d) the effects of plutonium on the FTC and CTC in hydride- as compared to oxide-fueled cores. It is found that the physics characteristics of hydride-fueled cores are fundamentally different from those of oxide-fueled cores as particularly manifested by the behavior of the FTC. In oxide-fueled cores the main phenomenon affecting the FTC is the well-known Doppler broadening of the fuel resonances. Hydride cores feature an additional unique phenomenon of spectral shift in the thermal energy range; it is the result of upscattering of the thermal neutrons due to the increase in the fuel hydrogen temperature. The interplay between the spectral shift and the shape of the low-energy cross sections of the fuel isotopes is responsible for the sometimes very different values of the calculated FTC for hydride- versus oxide-fueled cores and even for the same fuel type at different burnups. It is also concluded that fissile plutonium can have different effects on the FTC and, although the physics phenomena are quite different, on the CTC in hydride-fueled cores. If the plutonium is present in sufficiently large quantities, its effect can be negative, while if it is present in relatively small quantities, it is more likely to give a positive contribution. An additional finding is that the buildup of (135)Xe makes the FTC less positive in hydride-fueled cores, while it has little effect on the FTC of oxide-fueled cores. Also concluded is that thorium-containing hydride fuel cores feature a smaller FTC than that of oxide-fueled cores. This is due to a harder neutron spectrum in the Th-containing hydride-fueled cores leading to a smaller spectral shift, combined with the buildup of (233)U the contribution to the FTC of which in hydride-fueled cores is mostly negative. The insight gained through the analyses reported in this work facilitated the identification of an optimal, safe uranium-based hydride-fueled core design; it consists of U-ZrH(1.6) fuel in which 25% (volumetric) of the ZrH(1.6) is replaced by ThH(2). Burnable poisons have to be used to compensate part of the excess reactivity; IFBA is the preferred choice.

Ivan			Power Distribution Analysis for the ORNL High Flux Isotope Reactor Critical Experiment 3	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article								The mission of the Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactors Program is to minimize and, to the extent possible, eliminate the use of highly enriched uranium (HEU) in civilian nuclear applications by working to convert research and test reactors, as well as radioisotope production processes, to low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel and targets. Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is currently reviewing the design bases and key operating criteria including fuel operating parameters, enrichment-related safety analyses, fuel performance, and fuel fabrication in regard to converting the fuel of the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) from HEU to LEU. The purpose of this study is to validate Monte Carlo methods currently in use for conversion analyses. The methods have been validated for the prediction of flux values in the reactor target, reflector, and beam tubes, but this study focuses on the prediction of the power density profile in the core. Power distributions were calculated in the fuel elements of the HFIR, a research reactor at ORNL, via MCNP and were compared to experimentally obtained data. This study was performed to validate Monte Carlo methods for power density calculations and to observe biases. A current three-dimensional MCNP model was modified to replicate the 1965 HFIR Critical Experiment 3 (HFIRCE-3). In this experiment, the power profile was determined by counting the gamma activity at selected locations in the core. "Foils" (chunks of fuel meat and clad) were punched out of the fuel elements in HFIRCE-3 following irradiation, and experimental relative power densities were obtained by measuring the activity of these foils and comparing each foils activity to the activity of a normalizing foil. This analysis consisted of calculating corresponding activities by inserting volume tallies into the modified MCNP model to represent the punchings. The average fission density was calculated for each foil location and then normalized to the reference foil. Power distributions were obtained for clean core (no poison in moderator and symmetrical rod position at 44.536 cm withdrawn with respect to the core axial midplane) and fully poisoned moderator (1.35 grams of boron per liter in moderator and rods fully withdrawn) conditions. The observed deviations between the experimental and calculated values for both conditions were within the reported experimental uncertainties except for some foils located on the top and bottom edges of the fuel plates.

ENHANCED THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY FOR LWR FUEL	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						uranium dioxide and silicon carbide; enhanced effective thermal conductivity; nuclear fuel	COMPOSITE-MATERIAL; CONTACT RESISTANCE; URANIUM DIOXIDE; LATTICE; MATRIX; MODEL	The thermal conductivity of the fuel in today's light water reactors, uranium dioxide (UO(2)), can be improved by incorporating a uniformly distributed heat-conducting network of a higher-conductivity material: silicon carbide (SiC). The higher thermal conductivity of SiC along with its other prominent reactor-grade properties makes it a potential material to address some of the related issues when used in UO(2) (97% theoretical density). This ongoing research, in collaboration with the University of Florida, aims to investigate the feasibility and development of a formal methodology for producing the resultant composite oxide fuel. Calculations of the effective thermal conductivity (ETC) of the new fuel as a function of percent SiC for certain percentages and as a function of temperature are presented as a preliminary approach. The ETCs are obtained at different temperatures from 600 to 1600 K. The corresponding polynomial equations for the temperature-dependent thermal conductivities are given based on the simulation results. The heat transfer mechanism in this fuel is explained using a finite volume approach and validated against existing empirical models. FLUENT 6.1.22 was used for the thermal conductivity calculations and to estimate the reduction in centerline temperatures achievable within such a fuel rod. Later, the computer codes COMBINE-PC and VENTURE-PC were employed to estimate the fuel enrichment required to maintain the same burnup levels corresponding to a volume percent addition of SiC.

The interior and outside of the fuel assembly can be clearly observed on any cross section from any angle. These images make it possible to analyze deformations and microstructural changes in the fuel pins and abnormalities in the fuel assembly. An analysis was made for 12 7 central voids, i.e., one in each fuel pin of the traverse cross section, and the void sizes were tentatively related to the linear heat rating. Compared with conventional nondestructive and destructive postirradiation examinations (PIEs), this X-ray CT technique has great advantages including acquiring large numbers of PIE data in a short time, reducing PIE costs, reducing the amounts of radioactive waste generation, and physically protecting nuclear materials.

The paper presents a study of ICWC discharge performance and optimization of the conditioning output in the largest tokamak JET using the standard ICRF heating antenna A2 in a scenario envisaged at ITER full field, B-T=5.3 T: on-axis location of the fundamental ICR for deuterium, omega=omega(cD+).

MULTILAYER BIMETALLIC MEDIA AS PROTECTION METHOD FROM RADIOACTIVE RADIATION	PROBLEMS OF ATOMIC SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			Russian	Article							TRANSITION RADIATION	Multilayer bimetallic media as means of protection of the earth's space vehicle from radioactive space radiation is described in the proposed paper. Evaluation of radiation losses of electron energy in inhomogeneous media is carried out; these media may be formed by layers of materials with different dielectric constants or they may be simulated by dielectric permittivity varying in space by harmonic law. It is shown that in such media the radiation losses of electron are proportional to the square of parameter of inhomogeneity, that is the losses are low. In the case when in periodic laminar medium with sharp boundaries the conditions of parametric union of self-waves of medium are satisfied, the losses of electron are proportional to the inhomogeneity parameter to first power and are comparable with losses that are caused by elementary events of scattering. The mean length of radiation losses of electron with energy 2(6) MeV in multilayer bimetallic medium tungsten-aluminum with period L approximate to 0,3.10(-6) cm is comparable with mean path of electron in such medium. The characteristic angles of radiation have the discrete character and are directed from 0 to 180 degrees. The power of losses increases with the radiation angle increase and is maximal for characteristic angles approaching 90 degrees.	[Borts, B. V.; Tkachenko, V. I.; Tkachenko, I.

DEPENDENCE OF RATE OF N-13 AND O-15 RADIONUCLIDES PRODUCTION IN AIR FROM THE MAXIMAL ENERGY AND THE SPECTRUM OF BREMSSTRAHLUNG	PROBLEMS OF ATOMIC SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			Russian	Article								While using electron beams in physical experiments, medicine and industry their converting in bremsstrahlung takes place which leads to air radiolysis practically in all accelerating chamber (ACH). Forbidden period of an entrance to ACH at energy of accelerated electrons above 30 MeV is determined by the concentration of N-13 and O-15 in ACH air. However, now in the literature and normative documentation there is no data for concentration calculation of radioactive gases in ACH in an operational mode of accelerating setup with bremsstrahlung. By means of GEANT 4 package spectra of bremsstrahlung and neutron radiations are calculated, which are formed at interaction of an electron beam with a thick target. Also the dependence of constant rate for N-13 and O-15 radionuclides production in air are estimated at the energy of accelerated electrons from 25 up to 100 MeV. Obtained results can be used for calculation of concentration of radioactive gases in ACH and in atmospheric emissions.	[Gann, A. V.; Gann, V. V.; Pugachev, G. D.; Shapoval, I. I.; Shapoval, I.

SPECTROSCOPIC INVESTIGATION OF PF-1000 DISCHARGES UNDER DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS	PROBLEMS OF ATOMIC SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							HYDROGEN	The emission from free-propagating plasma streams was studied in experiments with a 1-MJ plasma-focus PF-1000 facility operated at the IPPLM in Warsaw, Poland. The machine was filled up with a pure deuterium or a mixture of deuterium and argon. Optical spectra were recorded at a distance of 30 cm from the electrodes, at different experimental conditions, i.e. initial pressures, charging voltages and acquisition times, in the wavelength range of 350 ... 1000 nm. The most intense lines originated from the applied working gases. In some cases distinct CuI and FeI lines resulted from the electrodes and the insulator were observed. From the Balmer lines, D(beta) and D(gamma), an electron density as a function of time was estimated. The application of this finding made it possible to perform some experiments concerning spectroscopic research on the interaction of free-propagating plasma streams with tungsten targets. In the recorded spectra some WI and WII lines were identified, but the resolution of the spectrometer was not good enough for their quantitative analysis.

Improvement of the European thermodynamic database NUCLEA	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd European Review Meeting on Severe Accident Research	2008	Nesseber, BULGARIA			Corium; Severe accidents; Thermodynamic; Database	PHASE-EQUILIBRIA; SYSTEM; LIQUIDUS; DIAGRAM; STEEL; MELTS; UO2	Modelling of corium behaviour during a severe accident requires knowledge of the phases present at equilibrium for a given corium composition, temperature and pressure. The thermodynamic database NUCLEA in combination with a Gibbs Energy minimizer is the European reference tool to achieve this goal. This database has been improved thanks to the analysis of bibliographical data and to EU-funded experiments performed within the SARNET network, PLINIUS as well as the ISTC CORPHAD and EVAN projects. To assess the uncertainty range associated with Energy Dispersive X-ray analyses, a round-robin exercise has been launched in which a UO(2)-containing corium-concrete interaction sample from VULCANO has been analyzed by three European laboratories with satisfactorily small differences.

Recent advances in understanding ruthenium behaviour under air-ingress conditions during a PWR severe accident	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd European Review Meeting on Severe Accident Research	2008	Nesseber, BULGARIA			Ruthenium; SARNET; Severe accidents; Air ingress; Fission products; PWR	UO2 FUEL; OXIDATION; CODE	In a hypothetical severe accident in a Pressurised Water Reactor (PWR), Fission Products (FPs) can be released from the overheated nuclear fuel and partially transported by gases, composed of a mixture of superheated steam and hydrogen, to the reactor containment. Subsequent air ingress into a damaged reactor core may lead to enhanced fuel oxidation, affecting some FP release, especially that of ruthenium. Ruthenium is of particular interest because of its high radiotoxicity and its ability to form very volatile oxides. In the reactor containment, such volatile forms are very hazardous as they are much less efficiently trapped than particulate forms by emergency filtered venting. In the four and a half years of SARNET, collaborative research dedicated to the "ruthenium story" has been performed by several partners. This paper presents the main achievements over the whole project period. Starting from experimental observations showing that fuel could be extensively oxidised by air to, and that a significant fraction of ruthenium inventory can be released, rather satisfactory models have been developed. In addition, the effect of the air interaction with Zircaloy cladding, as well as with UO(2) itself, has been studied. Experiments on the complex transformations of ruthenium oxides upon cooling through the reactor circuit have been performed. An unexpectedly large effect of temperature on the decomposition rate of gaseous ruthenium compounds has been found. as well as effects of the nature of circuit internal surfaces and other FP deposits. So it has been highlighted that various forms of ruthenium can reach the containment, but the most probable gaseous species under these conditions is ruthenium tetroxide. Preliminary analysis of ruthenium transport supports these conclusions. Experiments and analysis have also been launched on the radio-chemical reactions undergone by these ruthenium oxides in the reactor containment. Competing effects of gaseous decomposition to solid particles and re-volatilization from these ruthenium deposits have been demonstrated and modelled. The paper concludes by identifying the remaining work needed to achieve full resolution of the ruthenium Source term issue. Recommendations are made for future research activities in the follow-up programme SARNET2. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Presently there is no information available about radioactivity levels in Ordu soil and building materials. For this reason, activity concentrations in soil and building material samples collected from different sampling stations in Ordu were measured using gamma-ray spectrometry. In addition to natural radionuclides, (137)Cs was detected in the soil samples and the possible origins of this radionuclide were discussed. The activity concentrations of soil samples ranged from 13.4 to 151.7 Bq kg(-1) for (226)Ra, from 14.3 to 98.5 Bq kg(-1) for (232)Th, from 303 to 1107 Bq kg(-1) for (40)K and from 67.4 to 275.3 Bq kg(-1) for (137)Cs. The mean concentrations of (226)Ra, (232)Th and (40)K in selected building materials were 34.5, 26.9 and 378.4 Bq kg(-1), respectively. The results were compared with the reported data from different works. From the measurements, radium equivalent activity, terrestrial absorbed dose, annual effective dose rate, external hazard indices and internal hazard indices were calculated, and were found to be within the acceptable limits.

Measurement of doses to the extremities of nuclear medicine staff	RADIATION EFFECTS AND DEFECTS IN SOLIDS			English	Article						radiation dose; extremities; TLDs; nuclear medicine	RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS; HANDS; I-131	Medical uses of ionizing radiation now represent >95% of all man-made radiation exposure, and is the largest single radiation source after natural background radiation. Therefore, it is important to quantify the amount of radiation received by occupational individuals to optimize the working conditions for staff, and further, to compare doses in different departments to ensure compatibility with the recommended standards. For some groups working with unsealed sources in nuclear medicine units, the hands are more heavily exposed to ionizing radiation than the rest of the body. A personal dosimetry service runs extensively in Egypt. But doses to extremities have not been measured to a wide extent. The purpose of this study was to investigate the equivalent radiation doses to the fingers for five different nuclear medicine staff occupational groups for which heavy irradiation of the hands was suspected. Finger doses were measured for ( 1) nuclear medicine physicians, ( 2) technologists, ( 3) nurses and ( 4) physicists. The fifth group contains three technicians handling (131)I, while the others handled (99m)Tc. Each staff member working with the radioactive material wore two thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) during the whole testing period, which lasted from 1 to 4 weeks. Staff performed their work on a regular basis throughout the month, and mean annual doses were calculated for these groups. Results showed that the mean equivalent doses to the fingers of technologist, nurse and physicist groups were 30.24 +/- 14.5, 30.37 +/- 17.5 and 16.3 +/- 7.7 mu Sv/GBq, respectively. Equivalent doses for the physicians could not be calculated per unit of activity because they did not handle the radiopharmaceuticals directly. Their doses were reported in millisieverts (mSv) that accumulated in one week. Similarly, the dose to the fingers of individuals in Group 5 was estimated to be 126.13 +/- 38.2 mu Sv/GBq. The maximum average finger dose, in this study, was noted in the technologists who handled therapeutic (131)I (2.5 mSv). In conclusion, the maximum expected annual dose to extremities is less than the annual limit (500 mSv/y).

During the evaluation of the efficiency of decontamination, the impact of contaminants on the coating was not examined but the amount of contaminants residual after decontamination was, and was determined by activity measurements of the surface. The samples for testing were painted aluminum plates contaminated by liquid solutions of radioactive isotopes (60)Co, (133)Ba, (152)Eu and (241)Am (A = 12297.91 Bq/ml). Decontamination of contaminated samples was performed with 0.5% detergent solution on the basis of synthetic surfactants. The activity measurements of samples were conducted using gamma spectroscopy system with a high-resolution high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector of relative efficiency of 50% at (60)Co (1.33 MeV). The degree of removal of the radioactivity on the samples was observed as an indicator of the efficiency of decontamination. A comparison of the results is presented in relation to the retention time of the contamination on the surface coating, which is an important factor for the efficiency of decontamination. The samples with an alkyd coating system showed better efficiency of decontamination than the samples with the epoxy-urethane coating system, although the coatings based on epoxy and urethane resin were superior in relation to the alkyd in terms of protection, decorative characteristics and chemical resistance. The difference in the efficiency of decontamination for the examined coatings increases almost linearly in relation to the retention time of the contaminants in the coating.

External and internal radiation exposure of herbal plants used in Egypt	RADIATION EFFECTS AND DEFECTS IN SOLIDS			English	Article						herbal plants; gamma ray spectroscopy; radioactivity; annual absorbed dose; annual ingestion dose	NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; PAKISTAN; SOIL	Herbs in Egypt are imported from different countries and widely used in different forms. Owing to their different origins, the measured radioactivity levels show a broad range. For example, the radium concentrations in the studied herbs ranged from 7.71 +/- 0.25 Bq/kg in green tea to 115.08 +/- 0.49 Bq/kg in gawafa. (137)Cs concentrations were found to be quite different from one herb to another, ranging from below the minimum detectable limit to 12.62 +/- 0.42 Bq/kg. Some values are much greater than the UNSCEAR reported values for grain products and vegetables. The external exposure and the uptake of naturally occurring radionuclides were studied in terms of the annual effective absorbed dose and the annual ingestion dose, respectively. The herb store workers are externally exposed due to natural radiation in the herbs. The annual effective absorbed dose was calculated as 282.8 mu Sv for tilia, a dose which is over half the total annual effective dose due to terrestrial radiation (which is 410 mu Sv). Thus, it is potentially possible to accumulate excess doses from all herbs in the store which constitute a health hazard to the workers. For internal exposure, assuming a 1 kg/year annual intake for each herb, the annual ingestion doses are lower than the global value and can be further diminished if herbs with lower concentrations of radionuclides are consumed.

Two sharp bands at 617 and 660 cm(-1) are attributed to the SbO3- symmetric stretching mode. The reason for two symmetric stretching vibrations depends upon the bonding of the SbO3- units. The band at 617 cm(-1) is assigned to bonding through the Sb and 660 cm(-1) to bonding through the oxygen. The low intensity band at 508 cm(-1) is ascribed to the SbO antisymmetric stretching vibration. Low intensity bands were found at 503, 526 and 578 cm(-1). Sharp Raman bands observed at 204, 230, 307 and 315 cm(-1) are assigned to OSbO bending modes. Raman spectroscopy enables a better understanding of the molecular structure of the mineral brizziite.

Sixteen samples from three different origin fabricates were used. The estimation of radiation hazard indices were based on the evaluation of the concentration activities of the natural radionuclides (238)U, (232)Th and (40)K. The radium equivalent activity, external hazard index, internal hazard index and the annual dose equivalent associated with the radionuclides were calculated and compared with international recommended values to assess the radiation hazard. The values of internal and external radiation hazard indices were found to be less than unity. The annual effective dose rate obtained, E(eff), and the annual gonadal dose equivalent (AGDE) are found to be less than the limit of the doses recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection for the general public.

Study of plasma produced from deuterized-titanium irradiated by intense laser pulses	RADIATION EFFECTS AND DEFECTS IN SOLIDS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Workshop on Pulsed Plasma Laser Ablation (PPLA)	JUN 18-20, 2009	Monte Pieta, Messina, ITALY	Messina Univ, Inst Nazl Fis Nucl, Salento Univ Lecce, Bonino Pulejo Fdn Messina	Monte Pieta	titanium; laser irradiation; deuterium-saturated Ti; spectral lines of Ti-ions; D	ABSORPTION; EXPANSION; ABLATION; IONS	The paper reports on experimental studies of plasma generated by the irradiation of pure titanium (Ti) and deuterium-saturated (Ti+D 2) targets with intense laser beams from a Nd:YAG system operated at 1063nm (0.5J) or at 355nm (0.1J). The FWHM of laser pulses was 3ns and the laser power density on the target surface amounted to (0.7- 3)x1010W/cm2. Spectroscopic studies of plasma plumes were performed with a Mechelle (R) 900 spectrometer in the wavelength range of 300-1100nm, at a variable exposition time. The recorded spectra showed numerous lines originating from different Ti-ions and D+ desorbed from the (Ti+D 2) target. Estimates of electron temperatures during the plasma expansion gave Te=1.4-2eV for 0.1J pulses and 2.3-3eV for 0.5J ones. In the Ti+D 2 experiment, the electron density, as estimated from the D line, was Ne=(1.8- 4.6)x1016cm-3 and (1.9- 2.1)x1017cm-3 for 0.1 and 0.5J pulses, respectively. For the given Te, it was estimated that the Ti-I component density was about one order lower. The emission of D+ and various Ti-ions (ranging from Ti+ to Ti+14) was confirmed by corpuscular measurements, which gave higher values of energy < ETi >=420-1200eV and electron temperature Te=12-34eV for the initial hot-plasma phase.

For removal of the co-deposit layer a repetitive Nd:YAG laser was used. Determination of the characteristics of ions emitted from the laser-illuminated targets was performed using ion collectors (on the basis of a time-of-flight method) and an optical spectrometer. The main ion stream parameters and spectral lines of deuterium and carbon or tungsten ions were measured depending on laser pulse parameters. The research proved that optical spectroscopy could be a convenient method for on-line observation of the co-deposited layer removal by means of laser ablation. In combination with the investigation of collected co-deposit dust, the performed study made it possible to state that laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy can be useful as a diagnostic method for the ablative co-deposited layer removal and the wall conditioning. The properties of modified surfaces of samples and collected dust (evaporated co-deposit) were determined using different measuring methods.

Mass loss effect and the related outgassing are major concerns for its application in space. The changes in mass loss, outgassing and chemical structure under 120keV proton exposure were investigated for the AG-80 epoxy resin. The variation in chemistry was characterised by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Experimental results show that by increasing the proton fluence, the surface colour of specimens becomes darker. Mass loss ratios ascend remarkably until the fluence of approximately 6.3x1015cm-2 and then tend to level off. The surface roughness of specimens exhibits an increasing trend followed by a decreasing trend as a function of proton fluence. Under the exposure, the C-C, C-H, C-N and C-O bonds are broken, a variety of molecule ions with smaller molecular weight are formed and carbon is enriched in the surface layer of the specimens. The changes in mass loss and surface roughness of the AG-80 epoxy resin could be attributed to the formation of the molecule ions and the enrichment of carbon content in the surface layer due to proton radiation.

A comparison is made with the spectra of uranyl oxyhydroxide hydrates. Observed bands are attributed to the (UO2)2+ stretching and bending vibrations, U-OH bending vibrations and H2O and (OH)- stretching, bending and libration modes. U-O bond lengths in uranyls and O-H center dot center dot center dot O bond lengths are calculated from the wavenumbers assigned to the stretching vibrations. Raman bands of betafite are comparable with those of the uranyl oxyhydroxides. The mineral betafite is metamict as is evidenced by the intensity of the UO stretching and bending modes being of lower intensity than expected and by bands that are significantly broader.

Evaluation of natural recharge of Chingshui geothermal reservoir using tritium as a tracer	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article						Tritium tracer; Residence time; Age; Recharge; Geothermal reservoir	ENVIRONMENTAL TRACERS; GROUNDWATER SYSTEMS	Naturally existing tritium in groundwater was applied as a tracer to evaluate the natural recharge of the Chingshui geothermal reservoir. The residence time (or, age) of Chingshui geothermal water was first determined with tritium data at 15.2 and 11.3 year using the plug flow and dispersive model, respectively. The annual natural recharge was then estimated by combining the use of the residence time and the fluid-in-place of the Chingshui geothermal reservoir. The natural recharge for Chingshui geothermal reservoir was estimated at 5.0 x 10(5) and 6.7 x 10(5) m(3) year(-1) using the plug flow and dispersive model, respectively. Chingshui geothermal water is largely from a fractured zone in the Jentse Member of the Miocene Lushan Formation. The dispersive model more adequately represents the fracture flow system than the simple plug flow model. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This group of springs lies within a geothermal zone having exceptionally high heat flow about 230 mW/m(2), resembling young oceanic ridges. The spring gas has a high radon activity (similar to 885 kBq/m(3)) and is rich in helium (similar to 1.4 vol.%) with appreciably large flow rate. The measured radon exhalation rates in the soils of the spring area show extensive variations from 831 to 4550/mBqm(2) h while Rn-222 concentrations in the different spring waters vary from 3.18 to 46.9 kBq/m(3). Surface air at a radius of 40 m around the springs, within which is situated the Bakreswar temple complex and a group of dwellings, has radon concentration between 450 and 500 Bq/m(3). In the present paper we assess the radon activity background in and around the spring area due to the different contributing sources and its possible effect on visiting pilgrims and the people who reside close to the springs.

Considerable deterioration in mechanical properties was observed when the Nafion membranes swelling in electrolyte solution were irradiated. A reason is the promotion of degradation with oxygen molecules produced by the irradiation of electrolyte solution. The concentration of electrolyte solution influenced strongly the radiation deterioration in mechanical properties. Keeping the concentration of metal ions to be negligible is important when electrolyzed highly radioactive solution in the light of the durability of polyperfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) membrane. A sort of cation in electrolyte solution negligibly influenced radiation deterioration in mechanical properties. A sort of anion in electrolyte solution had negligible effect on radiation deterioration in mechanical properties and ion-exchange capacity. The discrepancy in the radiation deterioration in mechanical properties of Nafion membranes swelling in NaCl solution was observed between the specimens irradiated with gamma-rays and electron beams. This discrepancy can be explained from the low diffusivity of oxygen from bulk into the membrane. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A SURVEY OF GROSS ALPHA AND BETA ACTIVITY CONCENTRATIONS IN GROUNDWATER FROM KATSINA AREA OF NORTHERN NIGERIA	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							DRINKING-WATER; RADIOACTIVITY; RADIONUCLIDES; TURKEY; RIVER	Stratified sampling procedure was employed to collect a total of 40 samples; 2 front each stratum, measuring an approximate dimension of 3.25 km(2) of the actual sample site. Appropriate volumes were then evaporated and transferred into clean stainless steel planchets (ISO 9696 and ISO 9697). An eight channel gas-flow proportional counting system connected to a microprocessor loaded with a spreadsheet programme (Quarttro-Pro) and graphic programme (Multiplan) initially calibrated for efficiency was employed to count the background and the prepared samples. A mean efficiency of 33.44 and 41.24 % for the respective alpha and beta sources was obtained. A low background activity was also observed with a mean of 0.165 Bq for alpha and 1.119 Bq for beta. The gross alpha and beta activity concentrations in the water were found to range from 80 +/- 0.05 to 2300 +/- 0.41 Bq m 120 +/- 0.08 to 4970 +/- 0.78 Bq m(-3), respectively. This clearly indicate areas of elevated alpha and beta activity concentrations of 37.5 and 47.5% respectively when compared with the International Commission for Radiological Protection (1991) maximum acceptable values of 500 Bq m(-3) for alpha and 1000 Bq m(-3) for beta.

Direct dose measurement using a survey meter was carried out simultaneously. The present study, which is part of the survey, analysed the activity concentrations of U-238, Th-232 and AUK in granitoid samples from all over the region by HPGe gamma spectrometry. The activity concentrations of Ra-226 ranged from 94 to 637 Bq kg(-1), those of Th-232 ranged from 120 to 601 Bq kg-land those of K-40 ranged from 1074 to 1527 Bq kg(-1) in the analysed rock samples from different parts of the pluton. To evaluate the radiological hazard of the natural radioactivity in the samples, the absorbed dose rate (D), the annual effective dose rate, the radium equivalent activity (Ra-eq) and the external (H-ex) hazard index were calculated according to the UNSCEAR 2000 report. The thorium-to-uranium concentration ratios were also estimated.	[Canbaz, Buket; Cam, N.

For data acquisition and analysis, a high-purity germanium detector and a PC-based MCA were used. The mean activity concentrations of (40)K, (226)Ra and (232)Th were measured to be 2001 +/- 521, 329 +/- 491 and 414 +/- 309 Bq kg(-1), respectively, in rock samples, while in soil samples the activity concentrations were found to be 1482 +/- 280 Rq kg(-1) for (40)K, 134 +/- 64 Bq kg(-1) for (226)Ra and 177 +/- 102 Bq kg(-1) for (232)Th. The average outdoor absorbed dose rates in air, I m above the ground surface due to soil samples, were estimated to be 218 +/- 61 and 250 +/- 97 nCy h(-1) in the locations of Ngombas and Bikoue, respectively. The corresponding annual effective dose rates in air were determined to be 0.267 rnSv y(-1) in Ngornbas and 0.307 mSv y(-1) in Bikoue.

URANIUM CONTENT AND DOSE ASSESSMENT FOR SEDIMENT AND SOIL SAMPLES FROM THE ESTUARINE SYSTEM OF SANTOS AND SAO VICENTE, SP, BRAZIL	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							ARTIFICIAL RADIOACTIVITY LEVELS; RADON EXHALATION RATE; NATURAL RADIONUCLIDES; GRANITE AREA; RADIATION; TURKEY; RIVERS; SERIES; U-238; RATES	In this work, the uranium (U) content in sediment and soil samples collected near the Santos and Sao Vicente estuaries was determined using the fission track registration technique (SSNTD). The sediment and soil samples after men-dried and pulverised were prepared in the solution form. About 10 mu l of this solution was deposited on a plastic detector and irradiated at the IPEN-IEA-R1 (3.5 MW) nuclear reactor. After the irradiation and chemical etching of the plastic foils, the fission tracks were counted with a system consisting of an optical microscope together with a video camera and a PC. The U content in the analysed samples ranged from 3.12 +/- 0.55 to 18.3 +/- 1.2 ppm for sediments and from 3.21 +/- 0.63 to 11.5 +/- 1.1 ppm for soils or in terms of (238)U equivalent activity from 38.5 +/- 6.8 to 226 +/- 15 and 39.6 +/- 7.8 to 142 +/- 14 Bq kg(-1) sediments and soils, respectively. These results were compared with other values reported in the literature for sediments and soils collected in environments similar to the ones studied in this work. Most of the values obtained in this work are higher than the world mean and are in reasonable agreement with results found by other authors for sediments and soils from regions considered as polluted or with a high level of radioactivity.

This paper reports a new set of Phi values for internal electron emitters ranging from 10 keV to 4 MeV from various internal organs of the mother to the fetus based on three newly developed pregnant female tomographic models, called RPI-P3, RPI-P6 and RPI-P9. The results show a linear log relationship between Phi values and electron energy. The linear log coefficients have been derived and reported. The relationship between Phi values and mean distances between source organs and the fetus were also determined to allow for individual dosimetry. Since the RPI-P models have finer details of human anatomy and more realistic organ volumes and geometries, which follow the latest ICRP reference values, the newly derived Phi values could be used as reference values in determination of the dose to the fetus front internal electron emitters.

Radon concentrations in indoor air were determined using CR-39 nuclear track detectors. and the average (222)Rn activity was found to be 86 Bq m(-3) (equivalent to an annual effective dose of 2.2 mSv). Measurements of gamma doses in air were performed using plastic scintillators and the average absorbed gamma dose rates for indoor and outdoor were found to be 5.7 and 5 mu R h(-1), respectively, corresponding to an annual effective dose of 300 mu Sv. The radionuclide activity concentrations in soil samples collected from the study area were measured through gamma-ray spectrometry and the average activities were determined as 29, 39 and 580 Bq kg(-1) for the natural radionuclides (238)U, (232)Th and (40)K, respectively, and 5.2 Bq kg(-1) for the fission product (137)Cs. The natural radioactivity sources resulted in an annual effective dose of 75 mu Sv. The radioactivity levels of drinking water samples were measured as 0.044 and 0.1 Bq l(-1) for gross alpha and gross beta activities using a low-background counting technique (equivalent to an annual effective dose of 9 mu Sv). The results of this study showed that the region's background radioactivity level is in agreement with most Turkish cities.

PUBLIC EXPOSURE TO HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY IN OPEN-PIT MINING IN GHANA	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								The results or studies carried out on public exposure contribution from naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORMS) in two open-pit mines in the Western and Ashanti regions of Ghana are reported. The studies were carried out under International Atomic Energy Agency-supported Technical Co-operation Project GHA/9/005. Measurements were made on samples of water, soil, ore, mine tailings and air using gamma spectrometry. Solid-state nuclear track detectors were used for radon concentration measurements. Survey was also carried out to determine the ambient gamma dose rate in the vicinity of the mines and surrounding areas. The effective doses due to external gamma irradiation, ingestion of water and inhalation of radon and ore dusts were calculated for the two mines. The average animal effective dose was found to be 0.30 +/- 0.06 mSv. The result was found to be within the levels published by other countries. The study provides a useful information and data for establishing a comprehensive framework to investigate other mines and develop guidelines for monitoring and control of NORMS in the mining industry and the environment as a whole in Ghana.

RADIO-TOXICITY OF SPENT FUEL OF THE ADVANCED HEAVY WATER REACTOR	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								The Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR) is a new power reactor concept being developed at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai. The reactor retains many desirable features of the existing Pressurised Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR), while incorporating new, advanced safety features. The reactor aims to utilise the vast thorium resources available in India. The reactor core will use plutonium as the make-up fuel, while breeding (233)U in situ. On account of this unique combination of fuel materials, the operational characteristics of the fuel as determined by its radioactivity, decay heat and radio-toxicity are being viewed with great interest. Radio-toxicity of the spent fuel is a measure of potential radiological hazard to the members of the public and also important from the ecological point of view. The radio-toxicity of the AHWR fuel is extremely high to start with, being similar to 10(4) times that of the fresh natural U fuel used in a PHWR, and continues to remain relatively high during operation and subsequent cooling. A unique feature of this fuel is the peak observed in its radio-toxicity at similar to 10(5) y of decay cooling. The delayed increase in fuel toxicity has been traced primarily to a build-up of (229)Th, (230)Th and (226)Ra. This phenomenon has been observed earlier for thorium-based fuels and is confirmed For the AHWR fuel. This paper presents radio-toxicity data for AHWR spent fuel up to a period of 10(6) y and the results are compared with the radio-toxicity of PHWR.	[Anand, S.; Singh, K. D. S.; Sharma, V.

The Poisson parameter is assumed to be given by the quantity if interest in the inference process multiplied by a lognormally distributed normalising coefficient plus an additional lognormal background that might he correlated with the normalising coeflicient (shared uncertainly). The example of lognormal environmental background in uranium urine data is discussed. An additional uncorrelated background is also included. The uncorrelated background is estimated from a background count measurement using Bayesian arguments. The rather complex formulas arc validated musing Monte Carlo. An analytical expression is obtained for the probability distribution of gross counts coming from the uncorrelated background, which allows straightforward calculation of a classical decision level in the form of a gross-count alarm point with a desired false-positive rate. The main purpose of this paper is to derive formulas for exact likelihood calculations in the case of various kinds of backgrounds.

Effect of ionic strength on complexation of Pu(IV) with humic acid	RADIOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Plutonium; Humic acid; Analogy; Complexation; Conditional interaction constant (beta)	CHARGE NEUTRALIZATION MODEL; PLUTONIUM OXIDATION-STATES; NUCLEAR WASTE-DISPOSAL; SILICA-GEL; ACTINIDES; SOIL; SUBSTANCES; SOLUBILITY; SPECIATION; THORIUM	Successful geochemical modelling of the migration of radioactive materials, such as the transuranic elements, from nuclear waste repositories is dependent upon an Understanding of their interaction with biogeopolymers such as humic acids, the most likely complexing agents in ground-waters. An established silica/humic acid composite has been evaluated as a model substrate for naturally Occurring humate-coated minerals that are likely to be present in the vicinity of the repositories. The binding of Pu(IV), the highly likely oxidation station, by the silica/humic substrate was examined at pH 4 in the range 0.02 to 3.00 M NaClO(4) by the titration method. Pu(IV)-humate conditional stability constants have been evaluated from data obtained from these experiments by using non-linear regression of binding isotherms. The results have been interpreted in terms of complexes of 1 : 1 stoichiometry. Analysis of the complex formation dependency with ionic strength shows that the effect of ionic strength on humate complexation of Pu(IV) is not dramatically pronounced. The complexation constants are evaluated for the humate interaction with Pu(4+) and Pu(OH)(3)(+) at pH 4. The complexation constants are found, respectively, to be log (HA)beta(0) (Pu(4+)) = 16.6 +/- 0.3 and log beta(0)(1.3.1) = 46.6 +/- 2.3. The estimations through analogy from previous results are in agreement with these new experimental data.

Factors influencing plutonium sorption in shale media	RADIOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Plutonium; Sorption; Distribution coefficient; Grain size; pH; Water/solid ratio; Complexation	DISTRIBUTION COEFFICIENTS K(D)S; FISSION-PRODUCTS; IONIC-STRENGTH; PU; SPECIATION; ACTINIDES; TRANSPORT; WATER; AM; NP	The extent and factors influencing sorption of plutonium (Pu) in shale media have been studied in batch-type experiments. The equilibrium time and isotherm of Pu sorption have been firstly determined. The effect of shale grain size, aqueous pH, water/solid ratio, co-existing ions (cations and anions) and temperature were studied as the factors likely to influence Pu sorption. The experimental variables included the following: grain sizes in five ranges, 0.12 to 0.15 mm, 0.15 to 0.18 mm, 0.18 to 0.25 mm, 0.25 to 0.38 mm, and 0.38 to 0.83 mm; solution pH values of 4, 6, 8, and 10; water/solid ratios of 10 : 0.25, 10 : 0.5, 10 : 0.75, and 10 : 1; temperatures of 20 degrees C, 40 degrees C, and 60 degrees C); and selected coexisting conventional cations including Na(+), Fe(+), Al(3+), Ca(2+), and K(+) and anions including SO(4)(2-), CO(3)(2-), NO(3)(-), and Cl(-) in each case in solutions of the same total ionic strength. The experimental results demonstrate that the equilibrium time of Pu sorption is 9 d, that the sorption behavior of Pu in the solution is well described by the Freundlich sorption isotherm (C(s) = kC(eq)(N)), and that Pu is strongly sorbed on shale media. The extent of Pu sorption increased with decreasing grain size, apparently in response to the increase in specific surface area and total pore volume. The results also show that Pu sorption increases with increasing solution pH and with increasing water/solid ratio. The influence of co-existing anions on Pu sorption was much stronger, under the same conditions, than that of the cations; this was attributed to Pu complexation in solution, i.e., the complexing apparently weakened the sorption of Pu on shale particles in the solution. Finally, the influence of varying temperature on Pu sorption is found to be less important than that of other factors, but should never be ignored.
