The concentrations and activity ratios of uranium isotopes in the downstream decreased with increasing distances from the point of discharge and reached the reference value after 4 km The concentrations of uranium isotopes in the brook around LWR fuel fabrication facilities were lower than those in the downstream around HWR and LWR fuel fabrication facilities, while the activity ratios of U-234/U-238 in the brook were higher than those in the downstream. The concentrations of uranium isotopes in the ground water measured quarterly were variable depending on the sampling time. The concentrations of the gross alpha of airborne particulates collected around the nuclear facilities were found to be in the narrow range of 0.02 to 0.10 mBq/m(3) with a mean value of 0.05 mBq/m(3). Both the concentrations and activity ratios of Cs-137, Pu-239,Pu-240 and Sr-90 around the nuclear facilities were not very different from the worldwide fallout. The concentrations of uranium isotopes in the soil samples around the nuclear facilities were very close to natural background levels.

Other major industries associated with NORMs are the coal, copper and heavy mineral sectors. Legislation in South Africa addresses the allowed yearly radiation dose to the general public, and adheres to the most common internationally accepted standard of 1 mSv/a. The yearly dose is obviously the sum of the contributions from every individual nuclide from all possible sources. Accordingly, for members of the public, the individual sources are to be evaluated at much lower levels. This imposes severe constraints on the radioanalytical laboratory to offer an affordable routine service due to the required sensitivity to analyse these NORMs and the variety of matrices involved. For fish one is faced with an LLD requirement of around 1 mBq/kg, which poses problems with dissolution to allow radiochemical separations as direct measurements by gamma -ray spectrometry are not adequately sensitive for all nuclides of interest to assess the yearly dose.

Four stages of analyses were involved in the radiostrontium determination, namely scavenging-precipitation as a pre-purification step, separation of 90Sr and Ca from the matrix constituents, separation of Sr-90 from calcium and finally the purification of Sr-90. Both the detection and chemical efficiencies were performed using standard Ra-226 solution in the gross alpha -particle activity determination. The Sr-90 and gross a-particle activities were measured using a Canberra Alpha/Beta System Model 2400 low alpha/beta counter. The average activity reported for Sr-90 for the drinking water samples was 0.52 0.07 Bq/l, which is lower than the maximum permissable level (MCL) of 1.11 Bq/l allowed by WHO. The average reading recorded from 12 water samples from different treatment plants for gross a-particle activity was 0.396 +/- 0.039 Bq/l and this is much lower than the maximum contaminant level (MCL) suggested by the USEPA which is 0.555 Bq/l. However the specific activity for Ra-226 for clean water was 0.268 +/- 0.035 Bq/l, higher than the MCL of 0.185 Bq/l. Generally the treatment process has effectively reduced the natural radioactivity concentrations in all water samples taken at various stages of the process. The results obtained from this study were also discussed in the context of the source of raw water and its environment.

Typical oc-activities ranged from several mBq to 15 Bq. We use the term "geoaerosols"(2) to describe the particles' unique transport and propose a distinct quantum phenomenon mechanism to explain the radiation accumulation. If confirmed by subsequent experiments, the technique has potential for many practical applications such as locating faults or fractures, earthquake prediction, mineral and energy resource exploration, verification of underground nuclear testing, and refining risk estimates from environmental exposure to particles.

Two edible mushrooms species were selected for a long-term investigation in order to evaluate the Cs-137 contamination over a long time. Samples of Suillus variegatus and Cantharellus spp. were collected from 1986 to 1998 and their Cs-137 contents assessed. The results show that the activity of Cs-137 remained more or less constant in Suillus variegatus, while it increased in Cantharellus spp. This reflects the forest ecosystem of the mushrooms, where nutrient-poor substrates, rich in organic substance and with high pH maintain Cs-137 available for uptake. A decay-correction of the time distribution shows that radioactive decay appears to be the main factor affecting the content of Cs-137 in mushrooms, at least in the medium term.

Envisaging the uses of phosphogypsum, a characterization of this material in terms of spatial distribution of radionuclides was carried out by core samples taken from stacks of two important Brazilian phosphoric acid facilities. Samples were analyzed for U-238, U-234, Th-232, Ra-226, Ra-221, Pb-210 and Po-211 using alpha- and gamma-spectrometry and UV-VIS spectrophotometry. Specific activities of U-238, U-234, Ra-226 and Po-211 obtained were comparable with data reported in the phosphogypsum literature, while higher values were found for Th-232 and Ra-228.

This essentially comprises two mutually independent circuits of the radiation/material transport and the heat/energy conversion, centered at the integral reactor assembly, which enables one to utilize maximum benefits of nuclear energy under minimum risks of nuclear radiation. The entire reactor system resides in a thin and large Hastelloy vessel, the internal part of which is divided into a number of equipment compartments with neither connection pipings nor active valves necessary. As the reactor operates at very low FP inventory throughout its designed lifetime and there is no primary heat transport pipings outside the reactor vessel, significant release of radioactive materials due to any equipment failure should be incredible. The nuclear-thermalhydraulic characteristics of the molten ThF4-(UF4)-U-233 fuel salt extend the self-sustainability of the AMBIDEXTER fuel cycle to enhance the resource security and safeguard transparency. While maintaining the break-even conversion ratio criterion, a flexible fuel management strategy using a certain choice of denaturants should improve its own proliferation-resistance characteristics. As the core technologies associated with developing the AMBIDEXTER concept are mostly available in commercialized forms at present, investigating the integral performance of the concept should be the prime research topic in ongoing 250 MWth prototype design studies.

The INEEL's Advanced Test Reactor (ATR), the third generation of test reactors at the TRA, has base programs planned for the first half of the 21st century. As the role of nuclear technologies unfolds in the coming decades, past and future testing at the ATR will continue to contribute to technical, operational, and public issues facing the industry. System improvements have been completed or planned that will support operation of the ATR for many more decades. Optimal use of the past and future experience base will provide opportunities for continual improvement in reactor operations and performance. New programs at the ATR support plant aging studies for several international sponsors, disposition of excess weapons grade plutonium in MOX fuel, development of proliferation resistant fuels, and increased isotope production.

In order to reach this objective, a defect engineering technique was employed resulting in the development of Oxygen enriched FZ silicon (DOFZ), ensuring the necessary O-enrichment of about 2 x 10(17) O/cm(3) in the normal detector processing. Systematic investigations have been carried out on various standard and oxygenated silicon diodes with neutron, proton and pion irradiation up to a fluence of 5 x 10(14)cm(-2) (1 MeV neutron equivalent). Major focus is on the changes of the effective doping concentration (depletion voltage). Other aspects (reverse current, charge collection) are covered too and the appreciable benefits obtained with DOFZ silicon in radiation tolerance for charged hadrons are outlined. The results are reliably described by the "Hamburg model": its application to LHC experimental conditions is shown, demonstrating the superiority of the defect engineered silicon. Microscopic aspects of damage effects are also discussed. including differences due to charged and neutral hadron irradiation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

For this demanding task the hybrid pixel detector with silicon sensors has to work in a very harsh radiation environment with up to 3.5 x 10(14)n(eq)/cm(2) per year. On the basis of the known radiation effects a dual-track strategy wets followed for the development of radiation tolerant silicon pixel sensors. The ATLAS pixel collaboration successfully developed the radiation hard sensor design which meets the challenging requirements for the ATLAS pixel detector. In parallel, the hardening of the silicon itself was followed within the ROSE collaboration, which developed the radiation tolerant DOFZ-silicon with oxygen enrichment by diffusion. Taking all the results together the radiation tolerant silicon sensors have been designed, produced and showed excellent performance before and after irradiation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The microprobe consisting of a single stage Van de Graaff accelerator and two microbeam lines will be described. Simultaneous detection (X-rays, gamma -rays, charged particles, etc.) and imaging are routinely performed by a PC-based multiparameter data acquisition system. Telescope mounting is frequently used for particle identification particularly when performing nuclear reaction analysis (NRA). A unique feature of the Pierre Sue Laboratory nuclear microprobe is the ability to analyze radioactive samples. One of the two beamlines has been specifically designed for that purpose. Radioactive environment requires suited target handling and detection setups. Main application fields of the microprobe are material, earth, planetary, environmental sciences and electronuclear related topics. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The objective was to check the feasibility of hydrogen (and deuterium) profiting with an external beam of 3-MeV helium ions. The standard scattering geometry (incident beam at 15 degrees with respect to sample surface and emerging protons or deuterons at 15 degrees in the forward direction) was kept, but the thin foil absorber was replaced by helium gas filling the space between the beam spot and the detector over a distance of about 84 mm. Several standards prepared by ion implantation, with well known H or D depth profiles, were first analysed, which indicated that the analytical capability was as good as under vacuum. A striking feature is the much lower surface peak than under vacuum, a fact that enhances the sensitivity for H analysis near the surface. The same type of measurement was then performed on different materials to show the usefulness of the technique. As a first example, we have checked that the incorporation of H or D into sapphire crystals during mechanical polishing is below the detection limit. Another example is the measurement of the H content in emeralds which can be used as an additional compositional criterion for determining the provenance of emeralds set in museum jewels. The advantages and limitations of our set-up are discussed and several possible applications in the field of cultural heritage are described. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Surprisingly, a non-uniform artificial pattern on the surface of samples annealed above 1150 degreesC was observed. Nuclear reaction microprobe analysis and scanning electron microscopy were applied to reveal the origin and composition of the pattern. The surface topology and the maps of the light elements were studied. The backscattered signals in the NRA data provided maps of Si and variations in the elemental compositions at the surface of the specimens. With both techniques, significant differences in the elemental make-up within the pattern were obtained. The light elements were found to be enriched differently in the centre of the nonuniform patterns and the surrounding ring-like structures, suggesting the formation of compounds of C, N, O and Si.

This makes it a potential crystalline host matrix to immobilize actinides issued from separation of nuclear wastes. Irradiation induces amorphization of the crystalline structure (the metamictization process) and thus may decrease the chemical durability of the material. Leaching tests have been conducted on natural zircons from Brazil and Madagascar at 96 degreesC for a period of 1 month, using deionized water. Leachates have been analysed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and UV-visible spectrophotometry. Zircon solid surfaces have been investigated by coupling scanning electron microscopy and X-ray microanalysis (SEM-EDX) with nuclear microprobe analysis (mu PIXE, mu RBS and mu ERDA). From the mass balance between leachates and hydrated surfaces, the probable mechanisms of zircon aqueous alteration are presented and discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The average rare earth elements (REE) abundances of the Iceland spar calcite revealed a concave shape with positive Eu and Tb anomalies. All samples show comparable average REE abundances compared to average chondrites standard. The REE signal in hydrothermal solution seems to be similar for the different locations and age of formation although the absolute REE concentration in the solution was certainly different. The CL-properties of investigated Iceland spar varied from orange to green. The orange luminescence is based on Mn2+ in Ca-position of calcite while this uncommon green luminescence is most likely attributed to UO22+ complex ions associated with electron-hole centres.

The conventional scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray specrometry (SEM-EDS) was also applied to identify a U-bearing phosphate as saleeite, and to examine the distributions of the above elements to clarify relative advantages of mu -PIXE. The advantages of mu -PIXE are as follows: (1) the spatial resolution of mu -PIXE, about 0.8 mum(2) is higher than that of SEM-EDS, about 7 mum(2) (2) the contrast of elemental maps by mu -PIXE is better than that by SEM-EDS, (3) mu -PIXE detection of U using its L-line gives more reliable U distribution when clay minerals containing potassium are present. It is concluded that mu -PIXE is one of the best techniques that allows U to be accurately analyzed and mapped in K-bearing minerals, using its L-line. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

At the same time, fission products such as I-129 are implanted by recoil. Until 1995, the cladding tube pieces called hulls were embedded in concrete. The concrete medium being very basic, this study simulates the corrosion of hulls in the perspective of a long-term disposal in these severe pH conditions. This paper is dedicated to the study of the partial dissolution of the oxide layer, which is the responsible mechanism for the activity release. In order to follow the solid-liquid interface, europium was implanted into the material surface as a marker. Next, the corrosion induced in autoclave at 300 degreesC, 140 bars and in alkaline water was studied. The determination of europium. profiles using Rutherford backscattering spectrometry analysis (RBS) allows to deduce the fraction of dissolved ZrO2. It was shown that this dissolution is not homogeneous in porous zirconia and gives rise to the formation of crevices. Using the nuclear microprobe of Pierre Sue laboratory, a more precise study of the specimen surface was performed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A high-energy He2+ beam delivered by a cyclotron (CERI-CNRS) goes through the thin oxide and emerges in the water with 20 MeV energy. First results are reported here showing that the release of uranium increases by three orders of magnitude in aerated deionized water under high flux (greater than or equal to ,3.3 x 10(10) alpha cm(-2) s(-1)).

This paper presents new experimental results carried out with U samples embedded in a concrete matrix.

It is difficult to detect trace level uranium without concentrating wastewater. This study is a discussion of particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) analysis that is used to find concentration of uranium easily. In the procedure discussed here, the quantity of solution and backing material are examined to determine how they affect the practicality of taking measurements. Our study resulted in findings that show higher sensitivity, shorter measurement time and wider range of concentration than those obtained by usual methods. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Luthi, A; Chawla, R; Rimpault, G				Luthi, A; Chawla, R; Rimpault, G			Improved gamma-heating calculational methods for fast reactors and their validation for plutonium-burning configurations	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article								A new calculational scheme has been developed for the accurate assessment of gamma heating in fast reactors, its special feature being the determination of the gamma source distribution that is formulated in a near-to-exact manner. The improved methodology, which has been implemented into the ERANOS (European Reactor Analysis Optimized System) code package, is currently validated for Puburning configurations, for which gamma-heating target accuracies are particularly high. This has been accomplished through comparisons with new integral measurements conducted at the MASURCA facility, as well as with reevaluated earlier experiments. In the new measurements, absolute gamma-heating rates were determined in PuO2/UO2-fueled cores surrounded by a steel/sodium reflector mainly using TLD-700 thermoluminescent dosimeters. Thereby, a considerable effort was undertaken to minimize systematic errors. The calculation/experiment values determined from the analysis of the critical experiments are 0.90 for the PuO2/UO2 core region, 0.84 for the steel/sodium reflector, and 0.89 for an internal steel/sodium diluent zone. The most plausible causes for the observed discrepancies have been identified to be data related, i.e., too low fission gamma energies and too low capture cross sections for the structural elements. The transferability of the current validation findings to a modified Superphenix configuration, in which the radial fertile blanket is replaced by a steel/sodium reflector, and to the 1500 MW(electric) Pu-burning CAPRA 4/94 reference design has been demonstrated.

We have investigated the detection performance of detectors with different sizes of the Schottky contact pad (0.2-1.0 mm), using different gamma radioactive sources (Am-241, Ba-131 and Eu-152 With peak energy 60, 81 and 122 keV, respectively) and a laser source (lambda = 813 nm, pulse width = 43 ps, pulse energy 4 pJ). CCE Values up to 80% and minimum DeltaE/E of 6% at 60 keV were observed. For SI-GaAs Schottky diodes, evidence of the dependence of electrical and spectroscopic performance on the side of the pixel ("small pixel effect") is presented. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The number of photoelectrons (p.e.) per MeV deposited energy has been determined with a hybrid photomultiplier tube (HPMT). In response to radioactive sources a LY between 1.7 and 1.9 p.e./MeV was measured with 4% statistical and 5% systematic error. The LY optimization with appropriate wrappings and couplings was investigated by means of the HPMT. Furthermore, a fast Monte Carlo simulation based on the GEANT code was employed to calculate the characteristics of Cherenkov light in the PbF2 crystals. The computing time was reduced by a factor of 50 compared to the regular photon tracking method by implementing detection probabilities as: a three-dimensional look-up table. For a single crystal a LY of 2.1 p.e./MeV was calculated. The corresponding detector response to electrons between 10 and 1000 MeV was highly linear with a variation smaller than 1%.

Although the utilization of an intense pulsed muon beam is essential for X-my detection against a huge bremsstrahlung background from tritium beta -decay (Nagamine et al., Hyperfine Interactions 85 (1994) 343; 101/102 (1996) 521), a large number of emitted neutrons cause a pileup event in the detection system. We developed the neutron detection system, which had sufficient performance to determine Y-n and lambda (n) even in such a condition. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The applied method is based on modeling total effective cross-section of gamma radiation in the natural materials in function of the atomic number (Z from 1 to 92), in terms of the photoelectric and Compton cross-sections. Also. a new parameter (composition factor k) given by the ratio of the linear attenuation coefficients from the two tomograms is introduced. We investigated 16 materials with effective atomic number Z(eff) between 6 and 72.2 and bulk density ranging from 2.15 to 10.51 g/cm(3), using 310.5 and 469.1 keV gamma radiation. Our results show very good accuracy of the dual-energy CT method for most materials. The error in determining the effective atomic number is less than 5% for Z(eff) > 25 and less than 10% for light materials (Z(eff) < 15), while the error in density estimation is always smaller than 3%.

In the concept, several ordinary fuel pins in all fuel assemblies of a core are substituted by pins containing only zirconium hydride (ZrH). A parametric survey for the ZrH fraction from about 1 to about 5% was performed in this study to investigate the reactivity coefficients and the associated demerits in order to search the optimum fraction of ZrH. The metallic fuel core containing about 3% of ZrH showed the good results for all parameters. Following the parametric study, the effect of hydrogenous material in a metallic fuel core was experimentally confirmed. Doppler reactivity, sodium void reactivity and sample reactivity worths of plutonium and B4C were measured in a series of critical experiment at FCA of JAERI. The experimental results showed that the hydrogenous material significantly improved the Doppler and the sodium void reactivities. Analysis of experimental results was performed to check the applicability of the present design codes for a fast reactor with hydrogenous materials. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Kelly, M; Thorne, MC				Kelly, M; Thorne, MC			An approach to multi-attribute utility analysis under parametric uncertainty	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								The techniques of cost-benefit analysis and multi-attribute analysis provide a useful basis for informing decisions in situations where a number of potentially conflicting opinions or interests need to be considered, and where there are a number of possible decisions that could be adopted. When the input data to such decision-making processes are uniquely specified, cost-benefit analysis and multi-attribute utility analysis provide unambiguous guidance on the preferred decision option. However, when the data are not uniquely specified, application and interpretation of these techniques is more complex. Herein, an approach to multi-attribute utility analysis (and hence, as a special case, cost-benefit analysis) when input data are subject to parametric uncertainty is presented. The approach is based on the use of a Monte Carlo technique, and has recently been applied to options for the remediation of former uranium mining liabilities in a number of Central and Eastern European States.

Several hundreds fission product isotopes are included in partially depleted fuel as a result of direct yield from nuclear fission reaction, radioactive decay of fission products and/or neutron capture. The algorithm of the suggested method was coded and compared with both the analytical method and the international ORIGEN2 code system. The accuracy and speed of the calculations as obtained by implementing the method in a PCs with Linux system are found to be acceptable and faster than their resemblance. The effect of the calculated fission product concentrations on the reactivity of the reactor has been included. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The radiation damage of the polymer produced by gamma -doses of up to 1.05 MGy from Re-186 and Re-188 was examined by scanning electron microscopy and size exclusion chromatography. At a thermal neutron flux of 1.5 x 10(13) n/cm(2)/s the microspheres melted after 3 h in the nuclear reactor, but suffered little damage after 1 h of radiation and released less than 5% of the radioactivity during incubation in buffer at 37 degreesC. The radioactive microspheres produced in this manner have a specific activity too low for radioembolization for treatment of liver tumors, but could be injected directly into tumors or applied topically to the wound bed of partially resected tumors.

The synthesis and separation of the [F-18]bromofluoromethane were automated. [F-18]Bromofluoromethane was used to convert a phenolic and a thiophenolic precursor into a labelled ether and thioether, respectively. The specific radioactivity of these labelled products was determined with both high-performance liquid chromatography (with UV-absorbance detection) and liquid chromatography (with mass spectrometric detection). The median for the specific radioactivity, corrected at the end of radionuclide production, was 934 GBq/mu mol (range 40-9900 GBq/mu mol; n = 83). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The uranium content in the ashes of the organs was measured by the neutron-fission track counting technique. The most striking result is that the transfer coefficients, as a function of the uranium concentration, exhibit a concave shape with a minimum around 20ppm-U for all organs. Explanations to interpret this finding are tentatively given. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The implications of these results for the production of enhanced U-234/U-238 activity ratios in Cornish groundwaters are discussed. It is suggested that the U-234/U-238 lab data can be used to interpret activity ratios from Cornwall, even when the observed inverse relationship between dissolved U and U-234/U-238 in leachates/etchates is taken into account.

Proceeding from the basic requirements (safety: fuel supply; and nonproliferation of fissioning materials), inherently safe fast reactors of the BREST type can be used as the basis for large-scale nuclear power. Thermal reactors, which cart burn enriched uranium, thorium-uranium fuel, or mixed uranium plutonium fuel with makeup with fissioning materials front fast reactors, will operate for a long time simultaneously with fast reactors in the future nuclear power. VVER-1000 and CANDU reactors are examined as representatives of thermal reactors; for each of these reactors the operation in various variants of the fuel cycle is simulated It is shown that with respect to radiation characteristics of the,fuel and wastes the thorium-uranium fuel cycle has no great advantages over the uranium-plutonium cycle.

Their main concentrators (for uranium) in the samples are phases with fluorite type structure (zirconolite, pyrochlore, murataite), and brannerite. The critical dose for the transition of the crystal lattice of these phases into an amorphous state under irradiation with 1 MeV Kr+ tit room temperature was 3.10(18) m(-2) for zirconolite, (1.8-2.4).10(18) m(-2) for pyrochlore, (1.7-1.9).10(18) m(-2) for murataite, and 1.4.10(18) m(-2) for brannerite. The forms of murataite with 3-, 5-, and 8-fold motif of the fluorite cell all have close radiation resistance. These data make it possible to estimate the transition time of the murataite structure into the amorphous state to be 6-7 hundred yr and 6-7 thousand yr with hypothetical content of Pu-239 in it of 10% and 1%, respectively: The same values of the radiation resistance were obtained previously for titanates with pyrochlore structure, which were proposed by American researchers as matrices. for immobilization of excess weapons plutonium.

Using such devices for examining radioactively contaminated equipment and enclosures makes it possible to develop maps of the distribution of the radioactive contamination. Knowing the radioactivity distribution it is possible to calculate the exposure dose rate at any point of the enclosure and therefore to simulate the safest methods for performing decontamination work. In the present paper, decontamination work is simulated for an enclosure of a nonoperating research reactor at the Russian Science Center Kurchatov Institute. This reactor was shutdown for decontamination and disassembly. It is shown that the worker dose loads can be substantially decreased by performing the decontamination work in the correct sequence.

As a span of approximately five years must be bridged until the interim stores now planned and filed for will be commissioned and, at the same time, transport activities are to be reduced, a kind of anticipated interim storage, or temporary storage, on power plant sites is unavoidable. The concept for the temporary storage of spent fuel elements is described in the article. On the basis of this concept, the Neckar Joint Nuclear Power Station recently was awarded a storage permit for nuclear fuels under Sec. 6 of the German Atomic Energy Act. Temporary stores following the same concept have been filed for, and are now in the licensing procedure, for another four sites (Philippsburg, Biblis, Krummel, Brunsbuttel).

J	Kiener, E				Kiener, E			The importance of nuclear power to energy supply in Switzerland	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								The use of nuclear power is a matter of dispute also in Switzerland. The first opposition to plans for the Kaiseraugst nuclear power station near Basel sprang up in the seventies. In Switzerland, referenda are a popular expression of political disputes. On a federal level, a total of six referenda have been conducted about nuclear power since 1979. As a rule, antinuclear projects were rejected by a slim majority, except for the 1990 moratorium initiative. As a consequence, there was a ten-year ban on the construction of new nuclear power plants. Despite efforts by many parties it was not possible to develop a general consensus on an energy supply strategy. Because of the considerable importance to the power economy, and the economy at large, of nuclear power in Switzerland, where the five nuclear power plants in operation generate approx. 38 % of the country's electricity, while 58 % is produced in hydroelectric plants, a new Nuclear Power Act was adopted by Parliament in late February 2001. It constitutes the framework for the continued safe operation of nuclear power plants, keeps the nuclear option open for future planning, and handles spent fuel and waste management, final storage, and decommissioning. Also possible international solutions of final storage outside of Switzerland are taken into account. In this way, the Swiss government and parliament have advocated the continued use of nuclear power as one element of energy supply.

The RERTR program was conducted to develop new fuel for the use of low enriched uranium (LEU) in research reactors. As the unique properties of the FRM-II in research and application are based also on achieving a very compact reactor core with highly enriched uranium (HEU), additional irradiation tests were performed on the basis of the RERTR program. They were run in close cooperation with the French Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique (CEA) in its SILOE and OSIRIS facilities, among others. After extensive evaluation, also of other studies, these tests confirm the RERTR findings about fuel swelling behavior and, consequently, the suitability of U3Si2-Al (HEU) for use in the compact core of the FRM-II.

Program participants receive medical examinations and kt vivo and irt vitro bioassay measurements of residual radioactivity. Radiation doses to participants are largely a result of internal depositions of plutonium and its radioactive decay products. The causes of many of the higher internal doses were accidents that generally are well documented, Former radiation workers are invited to participate in the program if they meet specific criteria for radiation exposure. Informed consent is documented using a consent form approved by an Institutional Review Board.

J	Hjerpe, T; Finck, RR; Samuelsson, C				Hjerpe, T; Finck, RR; Samuelsson, C			Statistical data evaluation in mobile gamma spectrometry: An optimization of on-line search strategies in the scenario of lost point sources	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						spectrometry, gamma; emergency planning; Cs-137; radioactive materials		There is a potential risk that hazardous radioactive sources could enter the environment, e,g,, via satellite debris, smuggled radioactive goods, or lost metal scrap. From a radiation protection point of view there is a need for rapid and reliable methods for locating and identifying sources. The methods could also be used to locate hot spots after radioactive fallout. Carborne and airborne gamma spectrometry systems are suitable for the task. This work focuses on a situation where the radionuclide to search for is known, which is not an unlikely scenario. The possibility that the source is located near a road can be high, and thus motivating a carborne spectrometer system. The main object is to optimize on-line statistical methods in order to achieve a high probability for locating the point source and still have reasonably few false alarms caused by variations in the natural background radiation. Data were obtained from a carborne 3-L NaI(TI) detector and two point sources located at various distances from the road, The nuclides used were Cs-137 and I-131, Spectra were measured stationary on the road. From these measurements we have reconstructed counts in spectral windows applicable to different speed and sampling times; the time 3 s and speeds 32 and 54 km h(-1) are used in this work, The maximum distance a source can be located from the road and still be detected is estimated with four different statistical analysis methods. This distance is called the critical distance, CD, The method is applied on gross counts in the full energy peak spectral window. For each method alarm levels have been calculated from background data obtained in Scania (Sk (a) over circle ne), in the south of Sweden. The results show large differences in CD, With the best approach, the two sources could be detected from about 180 m (Cs-137, 6 GBq) and 170 m (I-131, 4.5 GBq).

J	Saito, M				Saito, M			Dose absorbed by mouse red bone marrow after oral administration of tritiated water	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						dose, absorbed; bone marrow; tritium; ingestion	ORGANICALLY BOUND TRITIUM; MICE; METABOLISM	Tritiated water (HTO) was given to mice orally. Dose accumulation patterns in various organs and tissues after oral HTO intake were compared with those after intraperitoneal injection. The accumulated dose was 10-20% higher after intraperitoneal injection than after oral administration. A new technique was developed to isolate mouse red bone marrow from tibia. The absorbed beta-ray dose in the red bone marrow after oral tritium intake was lower than the body-averaged dose that was estimated based on the tritium concentration in the urine or the blood and higher than the absorbed dose in the liver and testis.

This paper presents different studies and applications of this type of detector for qualification and quantification of radon and its progeny in laboratory and in the field, Since photodiodes are sensitive to environmental electromagnetic fields, protecting cells were adapted for use around the detector, A small three-channel (2-5.5 MeV; 5.5-6.5 MeV; 6.5-8.2 MeV) portable alpha counter was developed that allows the determination of the radon concentration and the radon exhalation rate. Numerous field applications were conducted in different conditions (uranium waste storage, dwellings, etc.) where this simple and inexpensive instrumentation demonstrated very good performance, reliability, and easiness of operation while measuring radon concentrations from 50-100 Bq m(-3) to several MBq m(-3).
