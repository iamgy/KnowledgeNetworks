K-H zeolite (K2Al2Si4O12. nH(2)O) was produced under optimum conditions of 160 degreesC, 3 d, 1 M (=mol/dm(3)) KOH and liquid-solid ratio of 15 cm(3)/g. The uptake behavior of radioactive cesium for the products was investigated by batch and column methods. The uptake equilibrium of Cs+ for the above product was attained within 2 h yielding the distribution coefficient of above 10(4) cm(3)/g. The uptake of Cs+ was followed by a Langmuir adsorption isotherm and the maximum uptake capacity was estimated to be 3.34 mmol/g. The successive removal of Cs+ was accomplished through the column packed with granular composites of product-alginate gel polymer.

Iron hydroxide Fe(OH)(2)-Fe(OH)(3) is used for preliminary pre-concentration of neptunium. Secondly, neptunium Np4+ and Pu3+ are separated by tri-isooctylamine-(TIOA) extraction in 8-10M HCl by redox with SO32--Fe3+. Neptunium Np4+ and uranium U6+ are separated by back extraction the Np4+ with 2M HCl. Finally, the neptunium is purified from the uranium and thorium by anion exchange in 8M HNO3 and 12M HCl. The stripping of 6M HCl + NH2OH . HCl further separates the neptunium Np3+ and uranium. Reduction by SO32--Fe3+ appeared to be an efficient way to obtain Np4+. The decontamination factors of the procedure are 4.0 . 10(4) for Th-232. 5.6 . 10(4) for uranium and 1.6 . 10(4) for plutonium.

Ni, Cd, Co, Pb, Al, Fe, Cr, Zn, Cu and Ca. Heavy metal concentrations in the samples were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy, laser excited fluorescence, and radon collector chamber. Factor analysis was used to describe the relationship among 16 elements. Four factors were extracted and they account for 67% of the total variance in the data. These factors are named as industry, sea, agriculture and geology. According to this result, not only industrial plants but also geological structure and agricultural activities were seen to contribute in polluting of the river water. Beside, these factors have shown that a lot of agricultural activities and a sharp increase in the population of the Gediz basin, and industrial development related to above reasons speed up pollution of water sources and become a potential risk on the unpolluted sources.

Results indicated that the major contribution to terrestrial background radiation is the natural radioactive series notably K-40, U-238 and Th-232. Estimated exposure rate at 1 m above the soil surface ranged from 0.9 to 20.6 muR/h in soils and 0.6 to 17.8 muR/h in rocks. Granitic rocks at Dodowa contain higher levels of the naturally occurring radioactive elements. The relatively low concentration around the Shai Hills may be due to the predominance of sand.

The amount of uranium retained in the organic phase depends on the type of TBP/diluent. Destruction of spent TBP is of high interest in waste management. The use of the oxidative degradation of TBP diluted with kerosene, carbon tetrachloride, benzene and toluene using potassium permanganate as oxidant was carried out to produce stable inorganic dry particle residue which is then immobilized in different matrices. The different factors affecting the destruction of spent waste were investigated. The uptake and decontamination factor for both Eu-152,Eu-154 and Hf-181 and the analysis of the final product have been studied.

The thermistor probe method developed by the authors was used to measure the thermal conductivity of bentonite and mixture of bentonite and silica sand with changing their density, water content and the volume of sand. The present and existing measured thermal conductivity was compared with various correlations and the correlations predicting well the thermal conductivity of them were identified. The correlation proposed by Sakashita and Kumada is recommended for the prediction of the thermal conductivity of bentonite. The thermal conductivity of mixtures is well predicted with Fricke correlation by simulating the real shape of sand particles to a spheroid and Bruggeman correlation.

This program is devoted to the source term of fission products (FP) released from PWR fuel samples during a sequence representative of a severe accident. The analytical experiments are conducted in a shielded hot cell of the LAMA facility of the Grenoble center of CEA (Commissariat l'Energie Atomique); as simplified tests addressing a limited number of phenomena, they give results complementary to those of the more global in-pile PHEBUS experiments. Six VERCORS tests have been conducted from 1989-1994 with higher fuel temperatures (up to 2600 K) compared with the earlier HEVA tests in order, in particular, to quantify better the release of lower volatile FPs. This paper gives an overview of the experimental facility, a synthesis of FP release from these tests and exhibits, as an example, some specific results of the VERCORS 6 test, performed with high burn-up fuel (60 GWd tU(-1)). The on-going VERCORS HT-RT program, designed to reach fuel liquefaction temperatures, is described before conclusions are drawn. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This burnup credit will make it possible to use the devices for spent fuels which are initially relatively high enriched. For that purpose, a method was developed considering: (i) partial Uranium-and-Plutonium burnup credit in the criticality studies, and (ii) a conservative assumption concerning the axial profile; this actinides-only method was supported by an experimental program called HTC. The method was accepted by the French Safety Authority. Moreover, in order to reduce again the calculated values of the reactivity for irradiated fuels, a French working group was set up in 1997 to define a conservative method which enables industrial companies to take burnup credit into account with some of the fission products and using a more precise profile. The work of this group has been divided into four tasks related to: the determination of (i) the composition of the fuel, (ii) a conservative profile, (iii) a conservative irradiation history, and (iv) the calculation scheme. This work is also supported by experimental programs related to the validation of the fission products effects, in terms of reactivity. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Chung, HM; Strain, RV; Shack, WJ				Chung, HM; Strain, RV; Shack, WJ			Tensile and stress corrosion cracking properties of type 304 stainless steel irradiated to a very high dose	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								Certain safety-related core internal structural components of light water reactors, usually fabricated from Type 304 or 316 austenitic stainless steels (SSs), accumulate very high levels of irradiation damage (20-100 displacement per atom or dpa) by the end of life. Our databases and mechanistic understanding of the degradation of such highly irradiated components, however, are not well established. A key question is the nature of irradiation-assisted intergranular cracking at very high doses, i.e. is it purely mechanical failure or is it stress-corrosion cracking? In this work, hot-cell tests and microstructural characterization were performed on Type 304 SS from the hexagonal fuel can of the decommissioned EBR-II reactor after irradiation to approximate to 50 dpa at approximate to 370 degreesC. Slow-strain-rate tensile tests were conducted at 289 degreesC in air and in water at several levels of electrochemical potential (ECP), and microstructural characteristics were analyzed by scanning and transmission electron microscopies. The material deformed significantly by twinning and exhibited surprisingly high ductility in air, but was susceptible to severe intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC) at high ECP. Low levels of dissolved O and ECP were effective in suppressing the susceptibility of the heavily irradiated material to IGSCC, indicating that the stress corrosion process associated with irradiation-induced grain-boundary Cr depletion, rather than purely mechanical separation of grain boundaries, plays the dominant role. However, although IGSCC was suppressed, the material was susceptible to dislocation channeling at a low ECP, and this susceptibility led to a poor work-hardening capability and low ductility.

J	Ashoub, N				Ashoub, N			The effect of high pressure test loop (HPTL) on the reactivity of ET-RR-2 reactor	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								The second Egyptian Research Reactor ET-RR-2 is a multipurpose research reactor. It is an open pool type, with nominal power of 22 MW water-cooled. The reactor pool is designed to accommodate two fuel test loops mainly 500 and 20 KW loop in the reactor reflector to enable performing experiments on the behavior of fuel rods for nuclear reactors under their operating conditions. For that, inserted high-pressure test loop (HPTL) loaded with suggested CANDU type fuel element in the reactor core is important to achieve the above reason. From the neutronic safety point of view, it is necessary to study the mutual neutronic and reactivity effect between the reactor core and HPTL. This paper aimed at the study of the temperature coefficients of fuel and moderator of the CANDU type fuel element at different U-235 enrichments, and the effect of HPTL on the reactor core reactivity. The effect of flooding the contact second shut down system (SSS) chamber with water and gadolinium nitrate on the reactor core reactivity in the presence of HPTL. All analysis was performed with the WIMSD4 and DIXY2 codes, This study shows that, an unacceptable change of reactor core reactivity was found due to the presence of the HPTL and the maximum inserted reactivity does not exceed 527 pcm at high possible U-235 enrichment (10%).

More than one CM for 4d states of Pol metal were obtained in photoemission experiments and reproduced by atomic and solid-state density functional calculations. Similar effects are predicted for the 4d bands of Ag, 5d bands of Au, and 5f bands of U metals. One of the solid-state CM for the U 5f states is found to superimpose the 5d --> 5f Fano resonance in Uranium metal. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The stacks were Calculated from the concentrations of elements which were determined by Synchrotron Radiation X-Ray Fluorescent Analysis and Neutron Activation Analysis. The profiles of Be-10 concentrations and flux suggest that the main reason or the fluctuations was the changing extents of dilution with terrigenous matter and diatom algae in layers belonging to warm and cold periods marked by the peaks of geochemical stacks. Contrary to the explanations proposed for other records, the rate of production of cosmogenic Be-10 is not the principal reason of Be-10 fluctuations in the sediments of Lake Baikal, however, the minor peak of Be-10 flux at ca. 40 ky BP may be partly due to the global increase in the production of Be-10 around the Laschamp excursion. The concentrations of Be-10 in the terrigenous fraction, as well as values of the warm geochemical stack, abruptly decreased at the wake of the cold stages, suggesting an increased rate of production of clastic matter which was the source of the terrigenous fraction of the lake sediments, Hence, they are candidates for the proxy of the accumulation rate of terrigenous materials in Lake Baikal sediments.

Factors complicating the evaluation of deuteron-lithium reaction characteristics and weak points of previous calculations and evaluations are discussed. A new method to obtain double differential cross sections of particles emitted in d+Li reactions is described. The method is based on the diffraction approach, a modified intranuclear cascade model, and the usual evaluation techniques. The cross sections predicted by this method are in good agreement with existing experimental data for deuteron interactions in thick lithium targets. The study of neutron-lithium interactions is performed on the basis of different approaches: coupled channels, diffraction scattering, and direct breakup models.

J	Pain, CC; De Oliveira, CRE; Goddard, AJH; Umpleby, AP				Pain, CC; De Oliveira, CRE; Goddard, AJH; Umpleby, AP			Criticality behavior of dilute plutonium solutions	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							ELEMENT	Numerical modeling of criticality transients in dilute plutonium solutions is presented. The solutions concerned may be expected to have an overall positive temperature coefficient of reactivity at ambient temperatures. Simulations were performed using the FETCH coupled radiation transport-multiphase hydrodynamics code for the cases of step and ramp reactivity insertions. The code has been developed for modeling scenarios beyond the reach of experiment and has been extended to cover the coupling of radiolytic gas behavior and pressure. It is demonstrated that dilute plutonium criticality, excursions may be terminated by radiolytic gas evolution provided that the gas is allowed to evolve freely, and that this may result in modest fission yields. However, it is also demonstrated that suppression of radiolytic gas bubbles by pressure may give rise to considerably energetic excursions with consequent large yields.

J	Lebrun, A; Bignan, G				Lebrun, A; Bignan, G			Nondestructive assay of nuclear low-enriched uranium spent fuels for burnup credit application	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								Criticality safety analysis devoted to spent-fuel storage and transportation has to be conservative in order to be sure no accident will ever happen. In the spent-fuel storage field, the assumption of freshness has been used to achieve the conservative aspect of criticality safety procedures. Nevertheless, after being irradiated in a reactor core, the fuel elements have obviously lost part of their original reactivity. The concept of taking into account this reactivity loss in criticality safety analysis is known as burnup credit. To be used, burnup credit involves obtaining evidence of the reactivity loss with a burnup measurement. Many nondestructive assays (NDA) based on neutron as well as on gamma-ray emissions are devoted to spent-fuel characterization. Heavy nuclei that compose the fuels are modified during irradiation and cooling. Some of them emit neutrons spontaneously, and the link to burnup is a power link. As a result, burnup, determination with passive neutron measurement is extremely accurate. Some gamma emitters also have interesting properties in order to characterize spent fuels, but the convenience of the gamma spectrometric methods is very dependent on the characteristics of the spent fuel. In addition, contrary to the neutron emission, the gamma signal is mostly representative of the peripheral rods of the fuels. Two devices based on neutron methods but combining different NDA methods which have been studied in the past are described in detail: 1. The PYTHON device is a combination of a passive neutron measurement, a collimated total gamma measurement, and an online depletion code. This device, which has been used in several nuclear power plants in western Europe, gives the average burnup within a 5% uncertainty and also the extremity burnup. 2. The NAJA device is an automatic device that involves three nuclear methods and an online depletion code. It is designed to cover the whole fuel assembly panel (active neutron interrogation, passive neutron counting, and gamma spectrometry).

J	Takahashi, M				Takahashi, M			An estimation method for off-gas sources in a boiling water reactor with nondefective fuel	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							FISSION-PRODUCT RELEASE; NUCLEAR-FUEL; CHEMICAL BEHAVIOR; UO2 FUEL; IODINE; ELEMENTS; RECOIL	A new method for off-gas source estimation in plants with nondefective fuel is proposed. This method based on the activity ratio between Xe-138 and Kr-88 is able to directly estimate the off-gas source using only measurement data. The Xe-138 to Kr-88 activity ratio is decided on the basis of the fissile irradiation with the different neutron spectrum in the core region and the fission fragment emission rate into coolant. This method was applied to actual plant data, and it was demonstrated that the dominant source of off-gas in a plant with nondefective fuel is Pu produced by the burnup of uranium impurities in the core structure. The concentration of uranium impurities in cladding estimated by this method is consistent with the result of neutron activation analysis.

J	Subbaiah, KV; Sunny, CS				Subbaiah, KV; Sunny, CS			KAMINI reactor south beam port shield-structure optimization	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								KAMINI is the Kalpakkam Mini Reactor, and its main purpose is to cater to experimental needs and for neutron radiography. It is a water-cooled reactor with U-233 as the fissile material. Using the Monte Carlo n-particle transport code MCNP, shielding optimization calculations are carried out for the south beam port tube, which is meant for neutron radiography of spent-fuel subassemblies of the fast breeder test reactor. The neutron beam port is a graded cylindrical aluminium channel starting from the center of the reactor core; it pierces through the biological shield and is 2 m long. The diameter of the channel at the core center is 54 mm, at the other end it is 25 cm, and it is 0.5 m below the floor level. The latter end serves as the neutron surface source for these calculations. The calculations have been carried out in cylindrical geometry (r, z) of shield structures. From results of the analysis, a movable shield 50 cm thick (25 cm paraffin and 25 cm lead), 75 cm wide, and 172 cin long extending similar to 95 cm into the demineralizer room (cooling water purification room) is proposed to replace the existing temporary shield structure. In addition, fixed shields of the same thickness and width of 50 cm on either side of the beam is recommended to reduce the dose levels to a few tens of microsieverts per hour in the accessible areas. Further, the lead-shielded cylindrical tube meant for insertion of irradiated fuel subassemblies for neutron radiography needs to be covered with 20 cm of paraffin up to a height of I m from ground level to avoid streaming of neutrons through the air column.

J	Liu, LC; Neretnieks, I				Liu, LC; Neretnieks, I			A coupled model for oxidative dissolution of spent fuel and transport of radionuclides from an initially defective canister	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							SENSITIVITY	An earlier model for oxidative dissolution of spent fuel was developed by including the release behavior of actinides from the fuel surface and the barrier effect of Zircaloy claddings. The aim here is to explore the possibility and consequences of precipitation in the water film around the fuel pellets due to solubility, and transport limitations of nuclides. The model has been applied in the performance assessment of a damaged canister under natural repository conditions, by coupling to a redox-front-based model for transport of nuclides. The simulation results identify? that the time of penetration of the canister, the size of the damage, and the initial free volume of the fuel rods are important factors that dominate the dissolution behavior of the fuel matrix and thus the transport behavior of actinides in the nearfield of a repository.

The fuels were then coated with boron carbide by chemical vapor deposition. Boron carbide was produced from the reaction of carbon tetrachloride and boron trichloride with excess hydrogen, in a tube furnace at 1000, 1100, and 1175 degreesC. The Fourier transform infrared data of boron carbide deposited on a silica glass were in agreement with the ones in the literature. The experiments showed that the composition of the coating changed with deposition temperature. There was boron-rich coating at low-temperature deposition, and carbon-rich coating at high-temperature deposition. The morphology and the thickness of the coating have been investigated by using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy.

Three different radon emanation technologies were used in these studies. The first was the "traditional" method of dissolving the sample. The second was an extraction of Rn from a melted sample and finally a technique of heating fine-grained powder was used. It is shown that there is good agreement of the data received with the emanation method and low background high purity germanium detectors. The sensitivity of this method is 0.02 mBq/1 of solution (for the "standard" emanation method) or 0.02 mBq/kg (for methods in which radon is extracted from a powder or melt).

If a rapid knowledge of Rn-222 levels is required and if a detection system is not available in situ, it is possible to obtain concentration of radioactive gas by determining of "delayed" counts of Po-214. The "delay" time consists of two or three hours. The method is based on the use of cellulose filters for particulate collection and on the analysis of samples by alpha spectroscopy. It is also possible to obtain concentrations of short-lived radon daughters Po-218, Pb-214, Bi-214, which are very important quantities in a medical framework. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The gas-filled linear radiofrequency ion trap system is installed at the Penning trap mass spectrometer ISOLTRAP at ISOLDE/CERN. Its purpose is to accumulate the 60-keV continuous ISOLDE ion beam with high efficiency and to convert it into low-energy low-emittance ion pulses. The efficiency was round to exceed 10% in agreement with simulations. A more than 10-fold reduction of the ISOLDE beam emittance can be achieved.

The deposition is carried out at a constant weak voltage of 30 V and starting current intensity of 3A. The deposition yields of uranium is investigated as a function of the amounts of various carriers and impurities such as Fe, Al, Bi, La and Ca as well as acetic, nitric and hydrochloric acids. All solutions containing up to 900 ppm of Ca2+ and 100 -150 mug of the foreign ions namely: Fe, Bi or La can be used with no chemical separation. Uranium and thorium recoveries between 80 and 96% are obtained and the resolution is typically 25-40 keV.

AD values of target radionuclides were determined from the in situ spectra collected at two disparate sites. A linear relationship between the two sets of A(D)s was found and the ratio between these two sets is equal to the square root of the ratio of the two respective absorbed dose rates measured at the sites at 1 m height. Absorbed dose rates were calculated using the concentration of potassium, thorium and uranium in the soils at the sites and found to agree well with the measured values. A(D) values can be predicted easily in in situ gamma spectrometry applying a simple experimental procedure that is based on the linear relationship. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The influence of the alpha -particle initial energy on the SSNTD detection efficiencies was investigated. Radon (Rn-222) and thoron (Rn-220) alpha -activities per unit volume were evaluated inside and outside the natural material samples by exploiting data obtained for the detection efficiencies of the SSNTD utilized for the emitted alpha -particles, and measuring the resulting track densities. Results obtained were compared to those obtained by other methods. Radon emanation coefficients have been determined for some of the considered material samples. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The counting rates (R) of photoelectric peaks of gamma -rays from nuclides with the same radioactivity divided by their emission probability (B) are expressed as a function of gamma -ray energy. The radioactivities of Th-234 and Pa-234 and 21.72 times that of U-235 are equal to the radioactivity of U-238 in natural uranium. Therefore, the plot of 21.72-fold R/B for U-235 should be on a curve fitted to the points fur Th-234 and Pa-234m in natural uranium. Depleted uranium with a U-235 isotopic composition of less than 0.68% could be discriminated from natural uranium in the case of a reagent containing 4.0 g of uranium. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The detector had the advantages of low noise level (1.7 +/- 1.0 cpm) and high sensitivity (32 +/- 1%) due to coincidence counting and large EGO crystals. Furthermore, the detector was easy to move, since a pair of the EGO housings coupled to photomultipliers was effectively arranged in parallel and a HPLC cell with different volume could be inserted between the EGO housing. This radio-HPLC system was useful for analyzing samples with low radioactivity. It was applied to the measurement of [C-11]FLB457 in plasma, having high affinity and high selectivity with dopamine D2 receptors. Extremely low radioactivity of [C-11]FLB457 (2500 dpm) could be analyzed by using the radio-HPLC system. The performance of this detector was compared with those of commercially available systems that had been used as sensitive detectors for HPLC. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The measurements were performed to evaluate which material was suitable for the construction of an enclosure, which would have a low background emission. The materials examined in this work showed concentrations of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 dramatically variable depending on the lithologies, particularly in the case of blocks, sands and aggregates commonly used in building materials in Sicily. The results are discussed and a criterion is indicated to reduce the radiation dose to humans. Since radon inlet is a major health problem, all the radiometric data and the geochemical features have been used to determine the radon exhalation, which arises from the disintegration of Ra-226 in soils and walls of houses, From our experimental data it can be seen out that one of the geochemical parameters, Total Alkali (TA), may be an appropriate index to select materials of low radiological risk.

Analysis of the results gives the basic parameters of the electronuclear system operating in a thorium-uranium fuel cycle. It is shown that an external neutron source (accelerator + target) makes it possible to switch to the thorium-uranium fuel cycle with expanded U-233 breeding without using fissioning uranium or plutonium isotopes. There are grounds for believing that with a higher accelerator current it is possible to achieve a regime where the heavy-water blanket can be replenished only with thorium with no U-233.

In 26 days of operation of the purification system the radioactivity of the water in both holding ponds decreased by approximately a factor of 100. Activity amounting to 6920 Ci was removed from the two ponds and concentrated on 1 m(3) of the sorbent Termoksid-3A, and 62.9 Ci remained in the pond water. Removal of spent sorbent was successfully performed by hydrotransport into a special container located directly in BV-1 under the water layer A new batch of Termoksid-3A was loaded into the sorption filter. A second purification cycle was performed for the holding pond water As a result, the radioactivity of the water of both ponds decreased to 2.10(-6) Ci/liter, which decreases the potential danger for the service workers and the environment in the case of leakage.

The combined use of gamma spectrometer and radar-tracer method, which "visualizes" a radioactive cloud, makes it possible to switch from qualitative analysis of gamma spectra to determination of quantitative content of radionuclides in the emission. Schemes for radar-spectrometric probing and the basic computational relations for determining the activity of radionuclides are examined.

J	Tokmantsev, VI				Tokmantsev, VI			Potential and local efficiency of the separation of nonisotopic binary gas mixture by centrifuge	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The balance of value, the separation potential, and the separation efficiency for nine isotopic binary mixture of gases are studied on the basis of a systematic application of local nonequilibrium thermodynamics and the Dirac axioms. In the first approximation of the kinetic theory, a universal classical expression for the potential is substantiated; this expression is valid for nonisotopic mixtures with arbitrary and not only weak or symmetric separation. It is established that the transition from molar to mass terms changes the potential. In contrast to the potential, the observed separation power of a system is invariant under a change of variables.

J	Posser, H				Posser, H			Legal issues associated with transports of spent fuel	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								Transports of spent fuel from German nuclear power plants to the reprocessing plants at La Hague, France, and Sellafield, UK, were affected by contamination of the outer surfaces of shipping casks above the existing limits. These findings were the subject of political and public debate. In the meantime, the technical questions have been settled, and transports have been resumed also on the basis of changed and optimized administrative and technical measures. These events have given rise to a number of legal issues, among them the legal nature of the applicable contamination limits and the question of who is responsible for observing them in this chain of transports. The legal basis of contamination limits in national law and international agreements and recommendations, respectively, and their definition and measurement are under discussion. As these limits are extremely conservative, it needs to be said that merely exceeding them is not associated with any radiological hazard; on the basis of commensurability, the existing precautionary levels, with the major safety reserves they incorporate, merely result in the obligation to remove contamination, but do not constitute a borderline to a health hazard. The responsibility for observing the appropriate limits is another point under dispute. At first sight, this responsibility rests with the sender, obviously the nuclear power plant operator. However. in the terminology of the Ordinance of Shipments of Hazardous Goods, the operators are not the senders but only the forwarders, which raises other problems about responsibility in the further course of the transport process.

J	Renneberg, W				Renneberg, W			Opting out of the commercial use of nuclear power in Germany and challenges arising to nuclear supervision	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								The governing majority in Germany has decided to opt out of the commercial use of nuclear power and to terminate this use in a safe and managed way. In the opinion of the federal government, the reasons for this decision include the potential for severe accidents, which is considered intolerable in the long run even though the probability of occurrence is low. In addition, there are the problems of final storage of radioactive waste, issues associated with the risk of proliferation, and the need to end a deep-seated societal conflict in Germany. In its function as the Top Regulator, the department responsible for nuclear matters of the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, and Nuclear Safety (BMU) has two important functions: It acts as the federal supervisor of the federal states which execute the Atomic Energy Act on behalf of the federal government, and it exercises the duty of preparing the nuclear policy outlined in the norms established by the federal government. After lengthy discussions with the operators of nuclear power plants an agreement was elaborated in preparation of a solution acceptable to all participants, which essentially defines an electricity quota for nuclear power plant operation and deals with spent fuel and nuclear waste management problems. This implies a number of challenges arising to the BMU as a consequence of the need to further ensure a high safety standard. If also means international efforts as well as the need to counteract the impending loss of competence in the nuclear field.

J	[Anonymous]				[Anonymous]			ILK recommendations on the use of probabilistic safety analyses in nuclear regulatory procedures	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								The International Nuclear Technology Committee (ILK), consultant to the German federal states of Baden-Wurttemberg, Bavaria, and Hesse, is an independent body of experts advising in matters of nuclear safety and the management of radioactive waste. Adapting nuclear power plants to the current state of the art so far has been difficult to ascertain quantitatively as far as gains in safety were concerned. Probabilistic safety analyses (PSA) are able to contribute to the necessary quantitative evaluation of safety. In addition, PSA can be employed in measures and decisions in nuclear regulatory procedures under a number of aspects. Accordingly, the ILK recommends the increased inclusion of probabilistic safety analyses in efficient regulatory processes of nuclear power plants. Moreover, in order to generate further knowledge from PSA, the necessary analytical tools are to be developed further, also in the light of international practice.									0	0	0	1	1	VERLAGSGRP HANDELSBLATT GMBH	DUSSELDORF	POSTFACH 10 11 02, D-40002 DUSSELDORF, GERMANY	1431-5254			ATW-INT Z KERNENERG	ATW-Int.

J	Iwatschenko-Borho, M; Lin, R; Keller, C				Iwatschenko-Borho, M; Lin, R; Keller, C			Safe detection of Co-60 new perspectives in contamination and clearance measurements	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								Consistent application of a newly developed coincidence technique to determine activation products in the operation and demolition of nuclear facilities results in very new perspectives in contamination monitoring and clearance measurement of plant components. In particular, it is possible to avoid the critical spread of point-source Co-60 contamination, the so-called hot particles. The CCM (Cobalt Coincidence Measurement) technique includes the coincident detection of prompt-prompt gamma cascades with Co-60 and other activation products (Ag-110m, Sb-124, Na-22) with low mass-specific limits for unrestricted clearance. Special features of the technique are the short measurement times, excellent signal-to-noise ratio, and focusing in space achieved. Compared to conventional integral gamma-measurements, the signal-to-background ratio can be improved by 1-2 orders of magnitude. The method can be employed especially where conventional integral or spectroscopic methods suffer from increased external gamma incidence fluctuating with time, or from natural radioactivity in the objects measured. In many cases, there is no need for lead shielding, which is a major advantage in the flexible use of this measuring technique. The article explains the special characteristics of the CCM method on the basis of elementary considerations in nuclear physics and mathematics. Comparisons are made with conventional techniques. The versatility of the method is demonstrated in a presentation of a number of monitor variants used in measuring persons, small parts, and surface contamination.
