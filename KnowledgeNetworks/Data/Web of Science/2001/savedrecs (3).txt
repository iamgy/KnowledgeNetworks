The capacity of the novel crown ion exchanger was found to be 2.25 meq/g dry resin. The heavier isotopes of magnesium were enriched in the solution phase, while the lighter isotopes were enriched in the resin phase. The separation factor was determined according to the method of GLUECKAUF from the elution curve and isotopic assays. The separation factors of Mg-24(2+)-Mg-25(2+) Mg-24(2+)-Mg-26(2+), and Mg-25(2+)-Mg-26(2+) isotope pair fractionations were 1.00095, 1.00857, and 1.00014, respectively.

The results were compared to gamma-ray spectroscopy measurements made in the laboratory on soil samples collected at the radon measurement sites. An assessment of the degree of disequilibrium of uranium and thorium was also made by comparison with neutron activation analysis, delayed neutron counting and equivalent uranium and thorium measurements. The results to date for equivalent uranium and radon show a strong correlation and indicate the possibility of soil radon mapping in Jamaica using gamma-ray spectroscopy. Three anomalous sites have been identified.

Uranium and polonium alpha-emitters belong to the most radiotoxic elements for human. In the paper, a study of the radioactive content of drinking (public) water in Gdansk agglomeration (Poland) was carried out. U-238, U-234 and Po-210 activity concentrations were determined by alpha-spectrometry with low-level-activity silicon detectors. The results revealed that the mean concentration of U-238, U-234 and Po-210 in analyzed water sample were 2.76, 2.86 and 0.48 mBq(.)dm(-3), respectively. Finally, effective doses due to uranium and polonium emissions were calculated for drinking water samples for the inhabitants of the agglomeration.

Investigation revealed that polonium is non-uniformly distributed within tobacco plant. Tobacco leaves constituting about 50% of the wet mass, contain 87.1% of the total burden of Po-210. Among the analyzed leaves about 66% of polonium is located in the oldest, over-ground part. The data obtained here indicate that Po-210 is generally taken up by tobacco from the dry or wet deposition of the radioactive fall-out onto the plant. Moreover, Po-210 concentration in tobacco leaves from Poland are higher than that in the other countries.

This method has been done in dry state (without catalyst and in presence of acetamide), in dimethyl formamide (DMF) as a solvent (without catalyst and in presence of tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (TBAB) as phase transfer catalyst (PTC)). In dry state, a trial to reduce the reaction temperature from 170 to 120 degreesC for the reaction between 5-Cl-MNPP and (NaI)-I-125 in presence of acetamide. as a molten medium was tested. Using some organic solvents such as ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), acetonitrile, and DMF, it was found that DMF gave low radiochemical yield of 5-I-125-MNPP (25%) within 30 min. However, the addition of 1 mg of TBAB to DMF increased the radiochemical yield of 5-I-125-NINPP from 25 to 95 within 30 minutes. The product 5-I-125-MNPP was purified by reverse phase, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), with radiochemical purity of greater than 98.0%. The biodistribution of 5-I-125-MNPP was demonstrated in normal mice through intravenous injection in the tail vein. The data show high uptake in the target organs equal to 2.5 +/- 0.22, 10.5 +/- 0.21, 4.3 +/- 0.27, 3.2 +/- 0.18 and 48.5 +/- 0.26 for brain, intestines, heart, kidneys and liver respectively.

The (k(HH)/k(DD)) KEE values between 5.7 and 7.0 indicate that the tunnelling is not involved in oxidation of deuteriated aliphatic carboxylic acids with chromium trioxide in acidic media and the oxidation KIE is determined by the zero point energy difference corresponding to the C-H/C-D stretching vibrations lost in the transition state. The results were compared with the large D-KIE observed in the oxidation of butyrate-D-7 with alkaline manganate caused by the simultaneous operation of zeropoint energy effect and tunnelling.

Absorbance was measured in I cm cell and the complex has a sensitive absorption peak at 654 run. The complex is formed instantly in perchloric acid and remains stable for 45 minutes. with constant absorbance. Beer's law is obeyed in the range 1-60 mug.g(-1) of thorium concentration with a molar absorptivity at 654 nm = 3.07.10(5) M-1-cm(-1) at 24 +/- 2 degreesC. The foreign ions interference in thorium determination have been checked. The cations were tested at > 60-fold excess of thorium, Mn(H), Fe(In), Co(E) and Ni(H) interfere negatively, whereas only Ce(R has increased the absorbance. Among the anions, cyanide, phosphate, thiocyanate and acetate at 150-fold excess of thorium cause significant interference. However, thorium can be determined in the presence of nitrate, chloride, oxalate, tartrate, ascorbate, thiosulphate, and citrate. The method has been applied on certified reference material for thorium determination after extractive separation and the result was found in good agreement with the certified value. The method has been also applied successfully to determine thorium at mug.g(-1) level in local ore samples with a precision of 0.04%.

J	Sauer, G				Sauer, G			Finite element computation of fission gas release from UO2 grains	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article								Fission gas release from the fuel is an important aspect of mechanical fuel rod design. It is required by design rules that gas release be limited. To predict the release in advance for arbitrary power conditions, a reliable computational tool must be available. A procedure based on the finite element method for evaluating the gas release is presented. The differential equation governing the diffusion process is approximated by a system of one-dimensional elements leading to small equation systems with few unknowns These systems can rapidly be solved allowing the computation of the diffusion and gas release for any power history in short time. The results obtained with the finite element approach are compared with analytical results for constant conditions. Additionally, the gas release under varying conditions is studied and the influence of the grain size on the gas release is discussed. Finally, some methods are described that enable the estimation of gas release based on the temperature histories of grain or fuel pellet centre.

J	Ashoub, N; Saleh, HG				Ashoub, N; Saleh, HG			The upgrade and conversion of the ET-RR-1 research reactor using plate type fuel elements	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article								The ET-RR-1 research reactor has been operated at 2 MW since 1961 using EK-10 fuel elements with 10% enriched uranium. The reactor has been used for nuclear applied research and isotope production. In order to upgrade the reactor power to a reasonable limit facing up-to-date uses, core conversion by a new type of fuel element available is necessary. Two fuel elements in plate type are suggested in this study to be used in the ET-RR-1 reactor core rather than the utilized ones. The first element has a dimension of 8 x 8 x 50 cm and consists of 19.7% enriched uranium, which is typical for that utilized in the ET-RR-2 reactor, but with a different length. The other element is proposed with a dimension of 7 x 7 x 50 cm and has the same uranium enrichment. To accomplish safety requirements for these fuel elements, thermal-hydraulic evaluation has been carried out using the PARET code. To reach a core conversion of the ET-RR-1 reactor with the above two types of fuel elements, neutronic calculations have been performed using WIMSD4, DIXY2 and EREBUS codes. Some important nuclear parameters needed in the physical design of the reactor were calculated and included in this study.

In various large-scale experiments, melts in the Mg-range with real corium compositions and temperatures around 2000 degreesC were tested using different substratum materials (concrete, ceramics, cast iron). These tests were carried out at Siempelkamp's CARLA melting facility for radioactively contaminated metal scrap supported by laboratory experiments at Siemens, Erlangen. The COMAS results indicate that for a sufficiently high melt release rate a quick and homogeneous coverage of an ex-vessel spreading compartment as realized in the Franco-German EPR project can be expected. Regarding the analytical assessment, it can be concluded that some spreading codes have reached a sufficient level to provide guidelines for the evaluation of spreading concepts. Open questions are mainly related to segregation and immobilization of the melt. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In most severe accident sequences, the ability of the containment boundary to maintain its integrity is determined by two factors: (1) the magnitude of the loads; and (2) the response to those loads of the containment structure and the penetrations through the containment boundary. Severe accident phenomenology and consequences has been the subject of worldwide intense research for more than 20 years. In this paper, the main threats to the containment integrity are reviewed, the state of knowledge and remaining uncertainties are briefly described, and the links with the relevant Community research activities are made. Finally, areas in which further research may be needed are listed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This combination makes them attractive cost-wise for countries with small and medium size grids that cannot afford larger units. For others, their fuel flexibility gives them extra attraction as burners of Plutonium (from weapons or LWR reprocessing) or to decrease minor actinide build-up by use of thorium. Extrapolation of existing technologies, mostly materials, are needed to bring the concept to life. The EU framework programme and collaboration with the Japanese and Chinese developments should help realise this wish. Two industrial groupings have launched the PBMR and GT-MHR concepts. Promotion of such forward looking concepts will also help attract talented young people to nuclear industry. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

With this background. defect spectroscopy data is presented for oxygen-rich detector materials using deep-level transient spectroscopy, photoluminescence. and electron-paramagnetic resonance. Among other observations, a defect level at E-C -0.067 eV is reported to be introduced at an enhanced rate in oxygen-rich material. The limitations of the spectroscopic techniques in identifying the microscopic origins for damage-induced doping changes are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We propose that the bulk effects of B on the grain boundary include the positive effect on the Ni enrichment at the grain boundary, i.e. the B atoms induce Ni atoms to substitute into Al sites, the negative effect on it, i.e. the B atoms substitute into Ni sites, and the neutral effect on it, i.e. the B atoms insert into interstices in the grain boundary. Our calculations show that owing to combination of the positive effect and the negative effect, corresponding to B-enrichment increasing, the Ni-enrichment and the Al-depletion become more and more obvious, when x increases from 0.1 to 0.5. Then, corresponding to B-enrichment decreasing, the Ni-enrichment and the Al-depletion also become more and more obvious, when x decreases from 0.9 to 0.5. Thus, between low (x = 0.1) and high (x = 0.9) B bulk concentrations, there is a B bulk concentration (x = 0.5), at which the Ni-enrichment and the Al-depletion become the most obvious, even if Ni is approximately saturated.

This effect, which can be accompanied by a thermal recovery, is accounting for the crystalline state of natural calcium phosphate apatites containing long lifetime actinide isotopes. The aim of the present study is to determine the influence of the silicate-phosphate grouping substitution, on the alpha -annealing efficiency. In addition, measurements have been performed on hydroxyapatite Ca(10)(PO(4))(6)(OH)(2) and compared with those obtained on fluoroapatite Ca(10)(PO(4))(6)F(2) to evaluate the influence of the OH(-)/F(-) substitution on the annealing efficiency. Using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) on line with an ion implanter, the main result obtained in this study is that alpha -annealing is strongly dependent on the chemical composition of the mineral. Our results show that this effect is decreasing when the SiO(4)/PO(4) ratio increases and when F(-) is substituted for OH(-) anions. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Sekimoto, H; Ryu, K; Yoshimura, Y				Sekimoto, H; Ryu, K; Yoshimura, Y			CANDLE: The new burnup strategy	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							REACTORS; FUEL	The new burnup strategy CANDLE (Constant Axial shape of Neutron flux, nuclide densities and power shape During Life of Energy production) is proposed. With this burnup strategy, distributions of fuel nuclide densities, neutron flux, and power density move with the same constant speed and without any change in their shapes. The excess reactivity is constant during the burnup. Therefore, any control mechanisms for the burnup are not required Calculation procedures are presented to find these shapes and the speed of the burning region with the neutron multiplication factor of a reactor employing this burnup strategy. To demonstrate the CANDLE burnup strategy, it is applied to a fast reactor with excellent neutron economy. Only the initially built reactor requires some fissile material such as plutonium or enriched uranium for the nuclear ignition region of its core, but only natural uranium or depleted uranium is required for the other region. Succeeding reactors require only natural or depleted uranium since the burning region of the previous reactor can be utilized for the ignition region. The life of a reactor can be made longer by elongating the core height. The drift speed of the burning region for the presented fast reactor design is similar to4 cm/yr, which is a preferable value for designing a long-life reactor. The burnup of spent fuel is similar to 40%. It is equivalent to 40% utilization of natural uranium without reprocessing and enrichment.

In this method, neutron sensitivity of LPRMs is obtained from alpha-ray current of U-234. The uncertainty of the calibration for neutron sensitivity using alpha-ray current was 2.1%, and the correlation coefficient of these neutron sensitivities was 0.868 (sample: 50 cases). Using this method, the neutron sensitivity can be obtained without irradiation tests of LPRMs in reactors.

In groundwater, the bicarbonate ion is the predominant and common anion; this work investigated radiation-induced chemical reactions of (bi)carbonate aqueous solutions with steady-state irradiation and pulse radiolysis methods. Aqueous solutions of sodium (bi)carbonate as high as 50 mmol.dm(-3) were used. The formation of formate, oxalate, and H2O2 were measured under different conditions. A complete set of reaction steps and reliable kinetic data for the radiolysis of (bi)carbonate aqueous solutions at ionic strength close to the groundwater were proposed. Kinetic calculations were completed based on the proposed reaction steps and the kinetic data obtained in the present work. The results from the calculation are in good agreement with the experimental results. With these proposed reaction steps and kinetic data, computer simulation can be performed to predict the yield of radiolytic products of (bi)carbonate aqueous solutions as a function of irradiation time and used to evaluate the safety of geological disposal options of spent fuel.

Originally, MAB were used for the treatment of pulp and paper wastewater. The interaction between radionuclides and bacteria was evaluated by determining distribution coefficients (K-d) over 10 days and at 5 degreesC and 35 degreesC. K-d for Np at 35 degreesC after 5 days had a low value around 10(-2). After 10 days, however, K-d was > 100-fold higher. On the other hand, Kd at 5 degreesC was low (10-2) throughout, without any significant increase over time. The interaction between Pa and MAB was found to be stronger than that for Np, with K-d for Pa about 100 times higher. The Kd was controlled by some basic factors; the activity of MAB, the complexing capacity of MAB, and the chemical conditions in the solution such as pH and Eh. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Chao, JH; Hsu, PC; Liu, HM				Chao, JH; Hsu, PC; Liu, HM			Measurement of high dose rates by photon activation of indium foils	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article								Photon activation of indium foils is proposed as a dosimetry technique for high dose rate measurements in a Co-60 irradiation facility. The irradiated indium nuclei may be raised to its metastable isomers of In-113m and In-115m. The isomer In-115m, with appreciable induced radioactivity, was selected for dose-rate measurements. Based on the photon flux distribution and the derived dose rates, which were simulated by the MCNP code, the dependence of dose rate measurement sensitivity of indium. foils with respect to photon energy at various irradiation distances is described. For practical uses, the radioactivity of In-115m was linearly related to the dose rate response at the specified irradiation positions. By comparing with a calibrated dosimetry system, the measurement deviation of the indium dosimeter, over dose rates ranging from 10 to 10(4)Gy/h, was evaluated and exhibited an uncertainty of +/- 7%. Other related characteristics including measurement sensitivity and range, linearity with respect to the variation of dose rate, and limitations of the indium dosimeter were evaluated to justify it as an alternative for monitoring dose rate in an irradiation field.

Measurements employing active and passive electromagnetic as well as seismic techniques are considered particularly suitable for detecting undeclared activities in a repository. The article contains an evaluation of the possibilities and limits associated with these techniques. Estimates conducted so far have been based mainly on experience with geophysics in exploring raw materials deposits, solving problems of geo-engineering, and in mine safety. This shows that there are hardly any studies specifically of the use of these techniques in nuclear safeguards. No general assessment exists of any of the methods proposed, as site-specific conditions and different emplacement and storage concepts have a major impact on the applicability of these techniques. In this respect, work focusing on specific aspects will have to be carried out in the future, such as the studies planned in Germany of the use of passive seismics in saline host rock. The results of a modeling study of using active seismics are presented. These studies showed that it is possible in principle to employ seismic techniques below ground. However, the expense in terms of technology and manpower is very great, Consequently, the envisaged use of this technique for inspection purposes seems to be impossible.

J	Lohrey, K; Max, A				Lohrey, K; Max, A			Classic nuclear fuel trading and new ways of doing business	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			English	Article								Nuclear fuel trading is a complex, dynamic, and innovative business segment. After the end of the East-West conflict in the early nineties it began to assume global dimensions. Yet, the volume of the nuclear fuel market is relatively small: In 2000, natural uranium worth approx. euro 1.2 billion was produced, and the value of the fuel freshly loaded in nuclear power plants amounted to approx. euro 8.0 billion. For comparison: The crude oil produced worldwide in that same year had a market value of approx. euro 715 billion. As a consequence of the strategic importance of uranium in the military sector, processing and using it as a nuclear fuel as well as trading it are subject to political influences. This also applies to the recycling of weapon-grade nuclear material into the civilian nuclear fuel cycle, which is already being practiced on an industrial scale. The deregulation of the electricity markets and the resultant cost pressure on electricity producers have initiated major changes in the nuclear fuel market. On the supply side, there is more and more concentration on a few large producers and trading companies. On the demand side, especially in the United States of America, more and more nuclear power plant operators merge into bigger enterprises with a considerable demand potential. Electronic trading over the Internet is going to supplement conventional trading in nuclear fuels, but is not going to replace it. The relatively small volume of the nuclear fuel market, the small number both of transactions and of active market participants, as well as individual wishes of customers, make it likely that electronic trading will remain restricted to a few market segments with standardized products.

J	Barthel, F; Wellmer, FW				Barthel, F; Wellmer, FW			Uranium resources and uranium supply	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								The availability of natural uranium is currently considered unproblematic. Out of concern about the sufficient availability of uranium, an international working group of OECD-NEA, in which the Federal Office for Geosciences and Resources (BGR) participates as a German partner, has conducted analyses of uranium availability since 1965. Its findings are published biannually in the so-called "Red Book," "Uranium, Resources, Production, and Demand." Changes in the political situation worldwide have profoundly influenced the military importance of uranium and thus also greatly improved its accessibility. As a consequence, there was a decline in production in the nineties from approx. 57,000 t of U in 1989 to, at present (2001), approx. 35,000 t annually. Estimates of the worldwide requirement of natural uranium in 2015 range between approx. 55,000 t and 80,000 t of U, because of the unforeseeable extent of the use of nuclear power, as against approx. 63,000 t of U in 2001. The most recent statistics published in the 1999 Red Bock show low-cost reserves (up to $40 per kg of U) of 1325 million t, and 2234 t of uranium at extraction costs of up to t $80 per kg. This indicates a statistical range of reserves of approx. 35 years. It should be noted that these figures are snapshots of a dynamic system. A resumption of extensive exploration and technical developments could greatly influence the resource situation. In the nineties, for instance, there is a net increase in uranium reserves of approx. 700,000 t of U as a consequence of exploration activities.

J	Bernhard, G; Friedrich, H; Nitsche, H				Bernhard, G; Friedrich, H; Nitsche, H			Radiochemistry building for actinides research - Technology, radiation protection, methods	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								A new building devoted to radiochemical work was commissioned in 1998. It was designed for studying the behavior of radionuclides such as thorium, uranium, neptunium, plutonium, americium, curium, radium, technetium, carbon -14 and tritium, which are important for the environment and for the life sciences. In accordance to the German Radiation Protection Ordinance (3) we are licensed to handle 170 different radionuclides with a maximum of activity for each nuclide of 1011 Bq. The laboratory building has 24 radiochemical laboratories and 10 service rooms (rooms for short-term storage of solid and liquid radioactive waste, and waste water, a room for safely storing radioactive samples in special safes, a control room with devices for measuring and signalization of safety and radiation protection relevant data, a separate top floor which houses all equipment for air conditioning, ventilation and filtering). The ventilation system guarantees an increasing negative pressure gradient from the hall-ways to the laboratories and from the laboratories to the glove boxes and hoods. The laboratories are equipped with 22 alpha-boxes, laminar boxes, hoods, dish washers for cleaning glass-ware, refrigerators, and drying cupboards. Glove box systems are installed for handling gram amounts of various actinide elements under air or inert gas. Several boxes are foreseen for experiments under special gas atmosphere (humidity, various carbon dioxide content e.g.), All rooms are located in one controlled area. Radioactivity and the dose rate of the air are constantly monitored. The exhaust air is automatically surveyed for tritium, carbon-14, radioactive iodine, alpha-, beta- and, gamma -activity in aerosols. All safety related data are monitored by an automated survey system. The entrance system to the building is controlled by an automated dosimetry system. This ensures a permanent overview and radiation exposure record for the personnel. Modern analytic methods are established in the laboratories. The building provides laboratory space for about 50 scientists and technicans to work with radioactive materials.

J	Shatalov, G				Shatalov, G			DEMO blanket testing in ITER. Influence on reaching DEMO	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	21st Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-21)	SEP 11-15, 2000	MADRID, SPAIN			DEMO blanket testing; ITER; non-fusion tests		ITER goal was specified as one step between now and the DEMO fusion reactor. One of the major issues is the tritium breeding blankets test relevant to future reactors. The major objectives of blanket modules (TBM) experiments in ITER are reduced in comparison with proposed test objectives in ITER-FDR. Thus, results of DEMO blanket designs testing in ITER will provide limited (but still useful) information that will need strong support from non-fusion facilities testing. The role of non-fusion tests is increased now to provide additional data required for DEMO blanket construction and qualification. A strategy of testing steps to DEMO blanket qualifications has to include parallel testing in ITER and in non-fusion devices. Experiments in fission reactors are able to provide essential data on materials radiation properties; tritium release, inventory and permeation; and thermomechanical behavior of the blanket breeder/multiplier. However, the volume in fission reactors is rather small and neutron spectra differ from the fusion reactor one. Nonetheless in the near future one depends primarily on fission reactor irradiation. The powerful accelerator based neutron source IFMIF could also provide useful information on radiation material properties. Plasma based neutron sources of different fusion devices could be the best choice for testing DEMO materials and blanket mock-ups. Timetable and costs of these devices are not clear now.

The external costs are in the range of a few mEuro/kWh depending on the plant model. The external costs are in general not dominated by the impacts due to radioactive emissions and releases. All stages of the life cycle contribute significantly to the external cost value. The external costs of fusion are in the same range as the external costs of photovoltaics and wind energy.

In addition, a peak heat flux as high as 20 MW m(-2) and a plasma flux of 10(18)-10(20) cm(-2) s(-1) are expected in the divertor zone during the normal operation of the reactor. The divertor materials have to withstand the neutron damage, the high heat fluxes and the high erosion caused by the interaction with the high flux plasma. The sputtered particles are co-deposited with plasma, which may contribute significantly to the total tritium inventory in the PFM. Furthermore, the interaction of steam with the sputtered particles (with usually high specific surfaces) could produce large amounts of hydrogen. All of the above topics represent critical issues for plasma performance, safety and economy, as they could limit the use of some PFM materials in next generation fusion devices. Therefore, substantial R&D effort is needed to elucidate the effects of the neutron induced damage on microstructure, erosion/deposition, tritium retention and dust formation, as well as on hydrogen production. In the framework of the European Fusion R&D program, an extensive effort on neutron effects of the material properties: namely, thermal conductivity, mechanical properties, dimensional stability, tritium trapping, erosion/deposition, co-deposition, dust formation/removal, chemical reactivity with steam and oxygen, outgassing, baking and tritium removal from PFM have been undertaken during the past several years. In this paper, the recent progress achieved within the European Fusion R&D program and contributions to the development of ITER PFMs are presented and critically discussed.

Accumulation of this particulate engenders potential safety problems, the main ones being chemical reactivity (hydrogen), mobilisation of radioactive dust in a loss of vacuum event, and tritium retention within the plasma chamber. The present prediction for the annualised particulate generation rate is many times more than the currently foreseen safety limits for in-vessel dust inventory. Thus, means may have to be provided to remove particulate on a routine basis. If a vacuum break is needed for batch particulate removal, the resulting reduction in tokamak availability may be unacceptable. Ideally, means should be provided to collect and remove particulate without breaking the vacuum, on a quasi-continuous, intra-shot basis. Vibratory conveying (VC) is one approach to particulate removal.

The surface temperatures of the un-irradiated, 0.3 and 0.4 dpa mockups at 5 MW/m(2) were about 300, 700 and 1200 degreesC, respectively. Surface temperatures of the irradiated mockups was increased by the degradation of CFC's thermal conductivity caused by neutron irradiation. No damage could be observed in the mockups up to 1000 cycles x 10 s at 5 MW/m(2) in this thermal cycle test. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Whilst the integrity of these Tile Assemblies has been monitored during previous man access shutdowns, with the introduction of tritium to the machine in May 1996, the majority had not been checked since March 1996. This paper reviews typical plasma facing Tile Assembly designs within the JET torus and summarises the experience gained for use in future machine applications. This includes loosening processes/mechanisms and their prevention, applications of surface coatings to avoid seizing of un-lubricated assemblies, and the use of vibration resistant thread profiles. The design of attachments to minimise combined mechanical and thermal stresses in the tiles, material selection and other engineering aspects are also discussed.

In order to further increase the beam power and extend the beam pulse duration time, a few issues concerning the negative ion source have to be solved. The most serious issue of them is non-uniformity of source plasma in the arc chamber. Two out of some countermeasures for improving the non-uniformity have been tried. The first is changing the spatial distribution of the arc discharge through regulating are current resistors which connect in series to each of eight filament groups. The second is masking both ends of the plasma grid with thin molybdenum plates to block beam extraction at the edges. Owing to these countermeasures, the acceleration efficiency of the deuterium negative ion beams in the accelerator has improved by more than 30% from 0.55 to 0.74. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The ITER radiation environment and the fact that the bushing forms part of the tritium barrier demand a component of great reliability and safety. An R&D task has been launched for the fabrication of a prototype bushing based on the SINgle GAP, SINGle APerture (SINGAP) 1 MeV accelerator being developed in the EU. We present the design of this prototype, which is to be tested at Cadarache, and compare it with the SINGAP bushing proposed for the ITER injectors. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.
