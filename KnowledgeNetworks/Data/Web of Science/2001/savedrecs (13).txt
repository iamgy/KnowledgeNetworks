J	Coates, JT; Fjeld, RA; Paulenova, A; DeVol, T				Coates, JT; Fjeld, RA; Paulenova, A; DeVol, T			Evaluation of a rapid technique for measuring actinide oxidation states in a ground water simulant	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Methods and Applications of Radioanalytical Chemistry (MARC-V)	APR 09-14, 2000	KAILUA-KONA, HAWAII	Amer Nucl Soc Top			SOLVENT-EXTRACTION; SEPARATION; PLUTONIUM	A system using an ion chromatograph coupled to a now-cell scintillation detector for rapidly measuring the oxidation states of actinides at low concentrations < 10(-6)M) in aqueous solutions was evaluated. The key components of the system are a cation-anion separation column (Dionex CS5) and a flow cell detector with scintillating cerium activated glass beads. The typical procedure was to introduce a 0.5 ml aliquot of sample spiked with actinides in the +III to +VI oxidation states into a 5 mi sample loop followed by 4 mi of synthetic groundwater simulant. Separation was achieved at a now rate of 1 ml/min using an isocratic elution with oxalic, diglycolic, and nitric acids followed by distilled water. Tests were first conducted to determine elution times and recoveries for an acidic solution (pH approximate to 2) and a ground water simulant (pH approximate to 8) containing Am(III)), Pu(IV), Th(IV), Pu(V), and U(VI). Then, an analysis was performed using a mixture of Pu(IV), Pu(V), and Pu(VI) in the ground water simulant and compared to results using the DBM extraction technique. Approximate elution times were the same for both the acidic solution and the ground water simulant. These were as follows: Pu(V) at 10 min, Am(III) at 15 min, Pu(IV) at 25 min, Th (IV) at 28 min and U(VI) at 36 min. Recoveries for the acidic solution were quantitative for U(VI) and Th(IV) and exceeded 80% for Am(III). Recoveries for the ground water simulant were quantitative for U(VI), but they were generally not quantitative for Th(IV), Pu(IV), and Am(III). For Th(IV) and Pu(IV), less than quantitative recoveries were attributed to the formation of neutral hydroxides and colloids; for Am(m) they were attributed to insoluble carbonates and/or hydroxycarbonates. When applied to the measurement of plutonium in the ground water simulant, the technique provided showed good agreement with the dibenzoylmethane (DBM) extraction technique, but it could not distinguish between Pu(V) and Pu(VT). This was likely due to the reduction of Pu(VI) to Pu(V) in the sample by the oxalic acid eluent. However, in spite of this limitation, the technique can be used to distinguish between Pu(IV) and Pu(V) in aqueous environmental samples within a pH range of 4 to 8 and an E-H range of -0.2 to 0.6 V, the predominance region for Pu(III), (IV), and (V). In addition, this technique can be used to corroborate oxidation state analysis from the dibenzoylmethane (DBM) extraction method for environmental samples.

Considerable improvement, especially in the textbooks of science studies, was found in comparison with the previous review carried out for the 236 textbooks which were published before, during 1991 through 1996. In these books, scientifically correct and appropriate descriptions are being made for the fundamental knowledge nuclear energy, radiation units, natural radiation and radioactivity, radiation effects for human bodies, and radiation utilization. On the other hand, however, it was found that fear for nuclear or radiation safety still prevails in several textbooks of social studies. For example, nuclear accident of Chernobyl nuclear power station is cited in 70% of the books reviewed, as the large demerit of nuclear power as an energy source, and some description are made based on incorrect scientific data and biased information. The authors analyzed the present situation from various educational standpoints, and presented several proposals for improving the situation.

These were then combined with the computer systems for planning and management of reactor decommissioning (COSMARD) as a database to estimate decommissioning project management data such as manpower needs and radiation exposure to workers. The Tokai Power Station decommissioning program, which will be conducted by the Japan Atomic Power Company as the first project on decommissioning a commercial nuclear power plant in Japan, was characterized by evaluating the project management data using COSMARD and the database. It was found from the study that COSMARD and unit productivity factors were applicable to planning and evaluation of reactor decommissioning programs.

The BWR cores studied have hydrogen to heavy metal ratio (H:HM) of 5.9 with increasing water rods and 7.0 with reducing a fuel rod diameter based on a reference 9x9 fuel (H/HM=4.9) of ABWR. The PWR cores studied have H/HM of 5.0 and 6.0 with reducing a fuel rod diameter based on a reference 17x17 fuel (H/HM= 4.0) of APWR. Equilibrium core design and plant safety analyses showed that those high moderation cores have compatibility with ABWR and APWR. The fissile Pu consumption rate is 22% larger than the full MOX cores with reference fuel of ABWR and 50% for APWR. The core performance and compatibility has been also evaluated in the condition of multi-recycle of Pu in these high moderation cores. Study has been conducted to evaluate the effect of introducing these high moderation cores in the fuel cycle of Japan. It shows that the high moderation cores produce 26% more cumulative electricity and reduce 22% stock of the fissile Pu by 2050 than the reference cores.

The air sampling systems at these stations require high technical standards regarding robustness, calibration and reliability. These systems are and will be deployed at locations where very different and often very, harsh environmental conditions can dominate. An overview of sampling systems is given taking in consideration environmental and operational constraints. Because of lack of experience running radionuclide stations at the required standards, several issues are still open and need consideration for future installations and operation.

The main purpose of the OSI is to find evidences of a nuclear explosion conducted anyplace in the world, however, the technical methods described in the paper might be employed for a suspected underground explosion. Various technical methods are described but they can be classified into two categories, namely, technical methods, 1) to identify fission products, and 2) to identify, underground evidences. Fission products can be identified by, conventional gamma spectrum analysis, however, for the OSI, radioactive Xe and Ar are important nuclides since they, are supposed to leak to the ground surface even when the explosion is conducted in deep underground. The seismic and various other technical methods, which might be commonly used by, mining industry, can identify the underground evidences, such as a cavity. However, these technical methods might be necessary, to be verified to confirm the applicability and effectiveness to OSI objectives.

On the basis of measured potentio-dynamic anodic polarization curves and the results of cyclic polarization tests, it was Found that both types of steel, as well as the corresponding welds, had a high pitting potential and a high protective potential, which means that they have a strong tendency to form a compact and corrosion-resistant passive film. The repassivation capability of both types of steel prevents the occurrence of stress corrosion cracking at the level of concentration of chloride ions which corresponds to the described type of waste. whereas absorbed atomic hydrogen does not reduce toughness or cause hydrogen embrittlement. The results of the research work confirmed that it is possible to use AISI 304L structural steel for the construction of containers for the temporary, 30-year storage of low and medium level radioactive waste.

Other samples were exposed to pure deuterium gas (0-1 MPa) at temperatures in the range 800-1100 K. Thermal desorption spectrometry (TDS) revealed two main trapping sites for deuterium in the buried oxide, The first releases deuterium at similar to 900 K (activation energy similar to2.5 eV) and the second at similar to 1250 K (activation energy similar to3.4 eV), They are attributed to dissociation of Si-D and Si-OD groups, respectively. The first peak is dominant in the implanted samples while the second is the dominant one for samples exposed to deuterium gas. The formation of the Si-OD groups is a temperature-activated process. The trapping of deuterium in the implanted samples is related to implantation-induced vacancy-like defects that are detected by means of positron beam analysis (PBA). Annealing at 900 K leads to a complete defect recovery. Deuterium profiling by SIMS confirms the trapping in the defects. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V, All rights reserved.

The use of radioactive Ni-59, which decays mostly by the nuclear K-electron capture to cobalt and the low-probability processes of ejection of the other K-electron allowed the observation of decays among very pure double inner-shell-hole states. The measurements were made using a pair of high-purity germanium detectors in conjunction with a fast-slow coincidence system and a 128 x 512 x 512-channel three-parameter pulse-height analyzer. The results for the hypersatellite shifts are Delta (K alpha (h)) = 274.9 +/- 1.6 eV and Delta (K beta (h)) = 354.5 +/- 4.6 eV, and for the satellite shifts Delta (K alpha (s) L-1) = 25.1 +/- 1.4 eV, Delta (K beta (s) L-1) = 39.1 +/- 4.8 eV and Delta (K alpha (s) M-1) = 8.8 +/- 4.2 eV. The results for the intensity ratios are I(K beta (h))/K alpha (h)) = 0.119 +/- 0.006, I(K beta (s) L-1)/I(K alpha (s) L-1) = 0.114 +/- 0.007, and I(K beta (s) M-1)/I(K alpha (s) M-1 = 0.092 +/- 0.023.

Both fibre optic sensors and communication fibres. were subjected to prolonged treatment in heavy water at temperatures up to 250 degreesC and pressures of 40 bar, Deuterium penetration is measured by a nuclear reaction technique based on a He-3 micro-focussed inn beam, which permits two-dimensional mapping of the deuterium penetration into cleaved fibres. Water penetration can be detected whilst still confined to the cladding, well before any optical effects become apparent, permitting prediction of likely fibre lifetime under down-hole conditions after realistic experimental times.

J	Porras, E; Sanchez, F; Reglero, V				Porras, E; Sanchez, F; Reglero, V			Background noise read out by CsI(Tl) detectors irradiated with high energy protons	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						CsI(Tl) detectors; proton-induced background; background modelling	CROSS-SECTION CALCULATIONS; ASTROPHYSICAL APPLICATIONS; STRUCTURAL-MATERIALS; RADIOACTIVITY; RADIONUCLIDES; CRYSTALS	Protons generate one of the most important contributions to the background noise in space gamma-ray telescope observations. This contribution comes from their direct intel actions with the detector as well as surrounding materials. Cosmic and geomagnetically trapped protons are the main sources of this proton flux, An accurate estimation of this background component before the construction of a telescope is a keg, point in order to ensure the foreseen instrument performances. In this paper ale present a comparison between experimental spectra acquired by CsI(Tl) detector units irradiated with 0.2 and 1.0 GeV protons and the results provided by a complete modelling of these units using different data of unstable isotope production cross-sections (experimental, semiempirical expressions of Silberberg and Tsao and the package GEANT/GCALOR based on Monte Carlo techniques). In all cases a better reproduction of the experimental spectra has been obtained by using the experimental production cross-sections, Data obtained from Silberberg and Tsao expressions generate a more accurate modelling than the GEANT/GCALOR approximations.

J	Rozon, D; Shen, W				Rozon, D; Shen, W			A parametric study of the DUPIC fuel cycle to reflect pressurized water reactor fuel management strategy	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							CANDU; REACTIVITY	For both pressurized water reactor (PWR) and Canada deuterium uranium (CANDU) tandem analysis, the Direct Use of spent PWR fuel In CANDU reactor (DUPIC) fuel cycle in a CANDU 6 reactor is studied using the DRAGON/DONJON chain of codes with the ENDF/B-V and ENDF/B-VI libraries. The reference feed material is a 17 x 17 French standard 900-MW(electric) PWR fuel. The PWR spent-fuel composition is obtained from two-dimensional DRAGON assembly transport and depletion calculations, After a number of years of cooling, this defines the initial fuel nuclide field in the CANDU unit cell calculations in DRAGON, where it is further depleted with the same neutron group structure. The resulting macroscopic cross sections are condensed and tabulated to be used in a full-core model of a CANDU 6 reactor to find an optimized channel fueling rare distribution on a time-average basis. Assuming equilibrium refueling conditions and a particular refueling sequence, instantaneous full-core diffusion calculations are finally performed with the DONJON code, from which both the channel power peaking factors and local parameter effects are estimated A generic study of the DUPIC fuel cycle is carried out using the linear reactivity model for initial enrichments ranging fr om 3.2 to 4.5 wt% in a PWR. Because of the uneven power histories of the spent PWR assemblies, the spent PWR fuel composition is expected to differ from one assembly to the next. Uneven mixing of the powder during DUPIC fuel fabrication may lead to uncertainties in the composition of the fuel bundle and larger peaking factors in CANDU. A mixing method for reducing composition uncertainties is discussed.

The code has been developed to simulate criticality transients in multiphase media and is applied here to fissile solution transient criticality. The predicted fission and pressure transients obtained by the enhanced numerical model are benchmarked against the results from the SILENE series of experiments on criticality transients in uranium solutions. The amplitude and the form of the first pressure peak, following a step reactivity change, are well represented, and insight is gained into the form of subsequent pressure oscillations. An explanation is given on the absence of these oscillations in. move energetic transients.

J	Choi, H; Ko, WI; Yang, MS				Choi, H; Ko, WI; Yang, MS			Economic analysis on direct use of spent pressurized water reactor fuel in CANDU reactors - I: DUPIC fuel fabrication cost	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						DIPIC fuel; fabrication cost; OREOX process		A preliminary conceptual design of a Direct Use of spent Pressurized water reactor (PWR) fuel In Canada deuterium uranium (CANDU) reactors (DUPIC) fuel fabrication plant was studied which annually converts spent PWR fuel of 400 tonnes heavy element (HE) into CANDU fuel. The capital and operating costs were estimated from the viewpoint of conceptual design. Assuming that the annual discount I-ate if 5% during the construction (5 yr) cmd operation period (40 yr) and contingency is 25% of the capital cost, the levelized unit cost (LUC) of DUPIC fuel fabrication was estimated to be 616 $/kg HE, which is mostly governed by annual operation and maintenance costs that correspond to 63% of LUC. Among the operation and maintenance cost components being considered, the waste disposal cast has the dominant effect on LUC (similar to 49%). From sensitivity analyses of production capacity, discount rate, and contingency, it was found that the production capacity of the plant is the major parameter that affects the LUC.

The conceptual design study has shown that fresh DUPIC fuel can be transferred to the core following the existing spent-fuel discharge route, provided that new fuel-handling equipment, such as the manipulator, opening/sealing tool of shipping casks, new fuel magazine, new fuel ram, dryer, gamma-ray detector, etc., are installed. The reverse path loading option is known to minimize the number of additional pieces of equipment for fuel handling, because it utilizes the existing spent-fuel handling equipment, and the discharge of spent DUPIC fuel can be done through the existing spent-fuel handling system without any modification. However, because the decay heat of spent DUPIC fuel is much higher than that of spent natural uranium fuel, the extra cooling capacity should be supplemented in the spent-fuel storage bay. Based on the conceptual design study, the capital cost for DUPIC fuel handling and extra storage cooling capacity was estimated to be $3750000 (as of December 1999) per CANDU plant. The levelized unit cost of DUPIC fuel handling was then obtained by considering the amount of fuel that will be required during the lifetime of a plant, which is 5.13 $/kg heavy metal. Compared with the other unit costs of the fuel cycle components, it is expected that DUPIC fuel handling has only a minor effect on the overall fuel cycle cost.

The cost estimation was carried out by the normalization concept of total electricity generation. Therefore, the future electricity generation scale was analyzed to evaluate the appropriate capacity of the high-level waste disposal facility in Korea, which is a key parameter of the disposal cost estimation. Based on the total electricity generation scale, it is concluded that the disposal unit costs for spent CANDU natural uranium,, CANDU-DUPIC, and PWR fuels are 192.3, 388.5, and 696.5 $/kg heavy element, respectively.

J	Ko, WI; Choi, H; Yang, MS				Ko, WI; Choi, H; Yang, MS			Economic analysis on direct use of spent pressurized water reactor fuel in CANDU reactors - IV: DUPIC fuel cycle cost	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						DUPIC fuel; fuel cycle cost; uncertainty analysis		This study examines the economics of the DUPIC fuel cycle using unit costs of fuel cycle components estimated based on conceptual designs. The fuel cycle cost (FCC) was calculated by a deterministic method in which reference values of fuel cycle components are used. The FCC was then analyzed by a Monte Carlo simulation to get the uncertainty of the FCC associated with the unit costs of the fuel cycle components. From the deterministic analysis on, the equilibrium fuel cycle model, the DUPIC FCC was estimated to be 6.21 to 6.34 mills/kW.h for DUPIC fuel options, which is a little smaller than that of the once-through FCC by 0.07 to 0.27 mills/kW.h. Considering the uncertainty (0.40 to 0.44 mills/kW.h) of the FCC estimated by the Monte Carlo simulation method, the cost difference between the DUPIC and once-through fuel cycle is negligible. On the other hand the material balance calculation has shown that the DUPIC fuel cycle can save natural uranium resources by similar to 20% and reduce the spent fuel arising by similar to 65% compared with the once-through fuel cycle. In conclusion, the DUPIC fuel cycle is comparable with the once-through fuel cycle from the viewpoint of FCC. In the future, it should be important to consider factors such as the environmental benefit owing to natural uranium savings, the capability of reusing spent pressurized water reactor fuel, and the safe guardability of the fuel cycle when deciding on an advanced nuclear fuel cycle option.

J	Nilsson, H; Rameback, H; Skalberg, M				Nilsson, H; Rameback, H; Skalberg, M			An improved method for alpha-source preparation using neodymium fluoride coprecipitation	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						alpha-spectrometry; actinides; coprecipitation; neodymium fluoride; electrodeposition; alpha-source preparation	SPECTROMETRIC DETERMINATION; ELECTRODEPOSITION; ACTINIDES; URANIUM	Coprecipitation on neodymium fluoride of actinides is a well known method for the production of sources intended for a-spectrometry. The procedure is based on the fact that trivalent neodymium fluoride complexes form microprecipitates in hydrochloric acid. This precipitate is membrane filtered and retained on a filter. Fluoride complexes of the measured actinides are kept in another hydrochloric acid solution. When the latter solution is filtered, the actinide complexes are retained onto the neodymium fluoride. The filters are placed on planchet trays and spectra are measured using a semiconductor detector in a vacuum chamber. According to the literature, the standard filtration method is vacuum filtration. In this work, a method based on plastic filter holders and disposable syringes operated by a direct current motor has been developed. Control of the filtrate flow rate and the use of disposable equipment are attractive features of the method. Sources produced with this method have been compared with sources prepared both by using vacuum filtration and by using electrodeposition. The results show that the method has a high and reproducible yield. In addition, spectrawith good resolution quality are obtained. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Sohn, KY; Yang, JW; Kang, CS				Sohn, KY; Yang, JW; Kang, CS			Assimilation of public opinions in nuclear decision-making using risk perception	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						public acceptance; decision-making; public participation; risk perception; multi-attribute utility analysis; AHP; fuzzy set theory; factor analysis		A method of assimilating public opinions in the decision-making process has been developed in this study. The proposed method will resolve the major shortcomings of existing decision-making models, which are deficient in, or missing public participation during the process. In the nuclear-related decision-making process, a particular concern of the public is nuclear safety, which is numerically characterized by risk. In reality, it is the risk that each individual perceives that is very important. Hence, the public perception of risk has been employed as a key decision-making element in representing public opinions. To quantify the public perception of risk, the psychometric model is used. Psychological risk dimensions are first assessed using factor analysis and a set of factors is identified for optimized computation. Expert opinions formulated by a group of selected professionals and experts are then aggregated with the public opinions. To gather public and expert opinions, separate polls were conducted in this study. In the aggregation, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and multiattribute utility analysis (MAUA) were employed, and for uncertainty analysis, a fuzzy set based approach was adopted. This method has been applied to analyze six options for spent fuel management in Korea for a case study. As expected, the results of the case study show that public risk perception is an important element in nuclear-related decision-making processes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The general range of Po-210 activity levels in all the dietary components (excluding milk and drinking water which are reported in mBq l(-1)) ranged widely from less than or equal to 10 to 112,641 mBq kg(-1) fresh, the minimum being in vegetables and maximum being in the edible portions (muscle) of crab samples. Po-210 levels in drinking water and milk samples ranged between 0.6-2.6 and 8-12 mBq l(-1) respectively. Po-210 content in cereals ranged from less than or equal to 32 to 745 mBq kg(-1) and in pulses it was found to vary between less than or equal to 32 and 294 mBq kg(-1). The range of Po-210 activity in different types of vegetables was found to be less than or equal to 10-653 mBq kg(-1). Among the different varieties of vegetables, Po-210 was significantly higher in leafy vegetables (28-653 mBq kg(-l)) as compared to rooty and other types of vegetables which ranged from less than or equal to 10-180 mBq kg(-1). In food of animal origin, the observed minimum activity of Po-210 was 8 mBq l(-1) in milk and the maximum observed was 122.641 mBq kg(-1) in the muscles: of crab. It was also observed that Po-210 activity was found to be in higher levels in the food of aquatic animal origin (1414-122,641 mBq kg(-1)) than in the food of terrestrial animal origin (other than milk) which varied from 41 to 963 mBq kg(-1). It is evident from the present study that the foods of animal origin especially crab, fish and prawn deliver significantly greater dose (93-3364 mu Sv yr(-1)) to the public compared to foods of plant origin whose mean dose ranged 0.08-128 mu Sv yr(-1). The study showed evidence to suggest that the total ingestion dose due to Po-210 received by the Kalpakkam public through dietary sources is significantly higher than the ingestion dose received due to fallout sources such as Cs-137 and Sr-90.

The specific concentrations for Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40, from the selected building materials, ranged from (12-65 Bq kg(-1)). (7-51 Bq kg(-1)) and (36 675 Bq kg(-1)), respectively. The measured activity concentrations for these natural radionuclides were compared with the reported data of other countries and with the world average activity of soil. Radium-equivalent activities were calculated for the measured samples to assess the radiation hazards arising from using those materials in the construction of dwellings. All building materials showed Ra,, activities lower than the limit set in the OECD report (370 Bq kg(-1)), equivalent to external gamma -dose of 1.5 mSv yr(-1). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Putin, President of the Russian Federation, at the Millenium Summit is analyzed and explained in detail. This speech proposes initiatives for improving nuclear power by working within an international project. The concept examined introduces into nuclear power a higher degree of safety and at the same time precludes accidents requiring the evacuation of the population. It introduces a new technology for handling nuclear radioactive materials for solving ecological problems and a general solution for the problem of nonproliferation by eliminating the separation of plutonium in pure form, U-233,U-235, and so on. 5 references.

J	Brejora, S				Brejora, S			Some thoughts on risk acceptance and nuclear power	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								Risks are assessed very differently in our modern society, While a number of everyday risks, some of which are hardly perceptible while others are quite spectacular, are accepted to a considerable extent, many other risks, often minor ones, are overemphasized and rejected. Risk assessment in the minds of people is a function of a number of subjective, emotional Factors with decisive psychological components which lead to irrational assessment especially of a number of manmade risks, including nuclear power. Factors to be mentioned in the assessment of the risks of nuclear power, among others. are the imaginary phenomenon of radioactivity and nuclear fission; the growing intrusion of technology into our living environment: the need to fall back upon expert knowledge; and the intuitive, wrong correlation of technical expense for safety with the perceived risk. As is seen, opinions are formed not solely on the basis of rational findings, but are influenced by many factors. some of which cannot be reproduced in a rational way. This makes it imperative to include in the debate about risks of technology, specifically the discussion about the use of nuclear power, the psychological aspect in order to arrive at a reasonable way for society to handle technology.

Early engagement of stakeholders in the identification and assessment of risks and in communications about risk management will be beneficial in most cases. Putting specific environmental problems into broader public health and ecologic context will be helpful to all parties and will improve decisions about how best to utilize precious resources and enhance public confidence in the process and the outcomes.

J	Blix, H				Blix, H			What views and uses of radiation sources in the 21(st) century?	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	36th Annual Meeting of the National-Council-on-Radiation-Protection-and-Measurements	APR 05-06, 2000	ARLINGTON, VA			National Council on Radiation Protection and; measurements; waste disposal; nuclear power industry; nuclear weapons		Considering that in 1899 neither biotechnology nor the electronic revolution were foreseen, some humility might be advisable when one looks into the crystal ball for the future role of radiation sources. In the past 50 years, nuclear medicine, nuclear weapons, and nuclear power have had a huge impact in the world. In the next 50 years, nuclear weapons may be phased out, nuclear power revived, and nuclear medicine may continue, especially for diagnostic purposes. Conflicts between great powers and blocks will no longer be about territorial or ideological domination but about trade, finance, information, and the environment and the weapons used will not be bombs but investments, credits, and control of information. Nuclear power-still based on fission-will be relaunched and get more uses, e.g., to propel ships, to produce heat for industry and for space heating, and perhaps to desalinate water. The public will be more at ease with radiation as it is better educated, as nuclear safety continuously improves and new types of nuclear power plants emerge, as waste sites fail to cause any problems, and as no other energy source is found to deliver so much energy at reasonable cost with negligible impact on climate and environment. One kilogram of oil corresponds to 4 kWh of electricity. One kilogram of uranium fuel corresponds to 50,000 kWh, and 1 kg of plutonium 6,000,000 kWh! In nuclear medicine, radiation may give way to other treatments as the understanding of cancer advances. On the other hand, the extreme ease with which sources of radiation can be identified is unmatched and likely to make them useful tools as tracers and markers in medicine-and other fields-for a long time. For certain uses-perhaps food irradiation-radiation sources, such as cobalt, may be replaced by accelerators which may be switched on and off at will. As more sources are used, registration and control of them must be made very effective around the whole world. Very high natural emissions of radon will continue to call for cautionary measures, but many other nonradiating substances will be identified as hazardous to health and call for vigorous intervention.

The results indicate that the proposed reconstruction algorithm is accurate, yielding the error due to the reconstruction scheme of less than 0.5%.

Materials and methods: TL that arose in untreated, X-ray-irradiated and ENU-treated B6C3F1 mice were examined both for K- and N-ras mutations by PCR-SSCP and DNA sequencing and for LOH by PCR with polymorphic microsatellite markers. Results: (1) ras gene mutations were found in a proportion of TL from X-ray-exposed (similar to 20%) and ENU-treated (30-40%) mice while no ras gene mutations were found in spontaneous TL. N-ras mutations were rare. (2) The spectrum of ras gene mutations was diverse and seemed to differ little between X-ray-induced and ENU-induced TL, even though there was a higher frequency of ras mutations in ENU-induced TL that clustered to K-ras condon 12. (3) The X-ray-induced TL showing K-ras mutation were associated with LOH on chromosome 6, while those showing no K-ras mutation were associated with high frequency of LOH on chromosomes 4, 11 and 12. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that, in the B6C3F1 mouse TL, X-ray-induced lymphomagenesis showed both the co-expression, yet low occurrence of allelic imbalance on chromosome 6 and K-ras mutation, and exclusive expression of frequent allelic imbalance on chromosomes 4, 11 and 12 and K-ras mutation.

In this study, the effect of soluble fission products (FPs) was first examined, and then the C-p measurement technique was improved to obtain reliable data for irradiated pellets of smaller than the standard size. A differential scanning calorimeter was applied to the C-p measurements. From the measurements of standard size alpha -Al2O3, the inaccuracy of the apparatus was estimated to be about 4%. The C-p data of undoped and simulated FPs-doped UO2 pellets of standard size were measured in the temperature region from 325 to 1673 K. From these results, the effect of impurities on the C-p values of UO2 pellets and the presence of the C-p anomalies in the simulated FPs-doped UO2 pellets were investigated. For measurements of small size specimens, the sample-side crucible was modified. The inaccuracy of the apparatus was estimated to be 5% using a small size of the alpha -Al2O3 sample. This improved technique was applied to obtain the C, data of UO2 and UO2-10 wt%Gd2O3 specimens with small sizes from 325 to 1673 R, which had been irradiated at isothermal conditions in a test reactor.

J	Kleykamp, H				Kleykamp, H			Phase equilibria in the UO2-PuO2 system under a temperature gradient	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Themodynamics of Nuclear Materials	AUG 06-11, 2000	HALIFAX, CANADA				OXIDE FUEL; OXYGEN; PINS	The phase behaviour of U0.80Pu0.20O1.95 was investigated under a steady-state temperature gradient between the solidus and liquidus by a short-time power-to-melt irradiation experiment. The radial U, Pu, Am and O profiles in the fuel pin after redistribution were measured by X-ray microanalysis. During irradiation, an inner fuel melt forms which is separated from the outer solid only by one concentric liquid-solid-phase boundary, The UO2 concentration increases to 85% and the PuO2 concentration decreases to 15% on the solid side of the interface, Opposite gradients occur on the liquid side of the interface, The concentration discontinuity is a consequence of the necessary equality of the chemical potentials of UO2 and PuO2 on both sides of the phase boundary which corresponds to a 2750 degreesC isotherm. The radial oxygen profile results in an O/(U + Pu) ratio of 2.00 at the fuel surface and 1.92 at the central void of the fuel. The redistribution is caused by the thermal diffusion of oxygen vacancies in the lattice along the temperature gradient. This process is quantified by the heat of transport et which ranges between -10 kJ/mol at the central void and about -230 kJ/mol near the fuel surface. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this study, mechanisms of this phenomenon were modeled for vapor transport concurrently occurring with thermal diffusion. Further improvement was modeled by accounting for the effects of the oxygen to metal ratio. Additionally, to evaluate more precisely the fuel temperature history during irradiation, the thermal conductivity in the fuel-cladding gap was evaluated by including the thermal effects of fission-product (FP) compounds. The calculated plutonium distribution in MOX fuel irradiation tests, with the linear heat rate (LHR) gradually decreasing with irradiation, agreed well with the measured data. improvement by considering the effect of the oxygen to metal ratio was considered to be effective and indispensable for the evaluation of plutonium migration in the MOX fuel.

The thermal conductivity of 45% U-ZrH1.6 in the range of room temperature -773 K was evaluated to be about three times higher than that of UO2 and nearly independent of temperature. Such a high thermal conductivity is favorable when this material is used as nuclear fuel. The pressure-composition-temperature (P-C-T) characteristics of UZr alloy hydrogen system were different from that of pure Zr. A plateau of the hydrogen pressure was found for H concentration (relative to the Zr concentration) between 0.2 and 0.6 for all temperature below 1173 K. This plateau region was attributed to UZr hydride formation from the UZr alloy. Over the plateau region in H concentration from 1.0 to 1.4, the equilibrium hydrogen pressure was a little higher than that of pure Zr, which was attributed to the reduced activity of Zr in UZr alloy. The activity of Zr calculated from the equilibrium hydrogen pressure was 0.90 at 1073 K, and 0.83 at 973 K. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Dubourg, R; Taylor, P				Dubourg, R; Taylor, P			A qualitative comparison of barium behaviour in the PHEBUS FPT0 test and analytical tests	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Themodynamics of Nuclear Materials	AUG 06-11, 2000	HALIFAX, CANADA				REACTOR ACCIDENT CONDITIONS; FISSION-PRODUCT RELEASE; OXIDE FUELS	Thermochemical considerations have been used to understand the difference between the barium releases observed in the PHEBUS FPT0 in-reactor severe accident test (<1%) and those observed in the ORNL and VERCORS analytical experiments (> 40%). BaO is slightly soluble in UO2, and BaUO3 may also be formed as a separate phase, as may BaZrO3 and more complex solid-solution phases. Barium vapour pressure is generally a monotonic function of the mole fraction of BaO in the fuel; however, the Ba vapour pressure decreases in the region between the solidus and the liquidus, because of a simultaneous decrease of Ba concentration in both liquid and solid phases. Zirconium and iron can also reduce the Ba volatility. These phenomena may be used to rationalize the low release of Ba observed in the PHEBUS FPT0 experiment.

J	Hiernaut, JP; Ronchi, C				Hiernaut, JP; Ronchi, C			Fission gas release and volume diffusion enthalpy in UO2 irradiated at low and high burnup	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Themodynamics of Nuclear Materials	AUG 06-11, 2000	HALIFAX, CANADA				FUEL PELLETS; RIM REGION; XENON	Samples of UO2, irradiated in LWRs at burnups from 25 000 to 95 000 MWd/t at in-pile temperatures below 800 K, were submitted to Knudsen-effusion experiments. In addition to the equilibrium vapour pressure of non-volatile species, release of fission gas was measured as a function of temperature and time up to approximately 2700 K, where complete vaporisation of the sample was eventually achieved. The fractional release curves of the main isotopes of Kr and Xe were measured and analysed with an algorithm adequate to discriminate between the relevant release stages, one of which, controlled by atomic diffusion, is analysed in this paper. The obtained enthalpy of diffusion - the same for all the examined nuclides - decreases from 4.6 eV/atom, at low burnup, to 2.95 eV/atom, at the highest burnup, Furthermore, the fraction of fission gas released via atomic diffusion markedly increases with increasing burnup, indicating a dramatic attenuation of the intragranular sink strength.

J	Hocking, WH; Verrall, RA; Muir, IJ				Hocking, WH; Verrall, RA; Muir, IJ			Migration behaviour of iodine in nuclear fuel	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Themodynamics of Nuclear Materials	AUG 06-11, 2000	HALIFAX, CANADA				FISSION-GAS DIFFUSION; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; OXYGEN DIFFUSION; RADIATION-DAMAGE; UO2 FUEL; IRRADIATION; RELEASE; COEFFICIENTS; OXIDES; XE	A novel out-reactor method has been further developed for investigating the migration behaviour of fission products in UO2 nuclear fuel, which allows the effects of thermal diffusion, radiation damage and local segregation to be independently assessed. Tailored concentration profiles of any desired species are first created in the near-surface region of polished samples by ion implantation. The impact of either thermal annealing or simulated fission is then precisely determined by depth profiling with high-performance secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). Comparison of iodine migration in UO2 wafers that had been ion-implanted to fluences spanning five orders of magnitude has revealed subtle radiation-damage effects and a pronounced concentration dependence for thermal diffusion. At concentrations above similar to 10(16) atoms/cm(3) much of the iodine became trapped, likely in microscopic bubbles. True thermal diffusion coefficients for iodine in polycrystalline UO2 have been derived by modelling the low-fluence data. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

The oxidation state of each sample used was conditioned to the 'uranium dioxide stage' by heating in the Knudsen cell under an atmosphere of 10%, CO2 in CO. The mass spectra were analyzed to obtain the vapour pressures of the lanthanum and uranium species. II was found that the vapour pressure of lanthanum oxide follows Henry's law, i.e., its value is directly proportional to its concentration in the solid phase. Also, the vapour pressure of lanthanum oxide over the solid solution, after correction for its concentration in the solid phase, is similar to that of uranium dioxide.

J	Manenc, H; Mason, PK; Kissane, MP				Manenc, H; Mason, PK; Kissane, MP			The modelling of fuel volatilisation in accident conditions	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Themodynamics of Nuclear Materials	AUG 06-11, 2000	HALIFAX, CANADA				STEAM	For oxidising conditions, at high temperatures, the pressure of uranium vapour species at the fuel surface is predicted to be high. These vapour species can be transported away from the fuel surface, giving rise to significant amounts of volatilised fuel. as has been observed during small-scale experiments and taken into account in different models. Hence, fuel volatilisation must be taken into account in the conduct of a simulated severe accident such as the Phebus FPT-4 experiment. A large-scale in-pile test is designed to investigate the release of fission products and actinides from irradiated UO2 fuel in a debris bed and molten pool configuration. Best estimate predictions for fuel volatilisation were performed before the test. This analysis was used to assess the maximum possible loading of filters collecting emissions and the consequences for the filter-change schedule. Following successful completion of the experiment, blind post-test analysis is being performed; boundary conditions for the calculations are based on the preliminary post-test analysis with the core degradation code ICARE2 [J.C. Crestia, G. Repetto, S. Ederli, in: Proceedings of the Fourth Technical Seminar on the PHEBUS FP Programme. Marseille. France, 20-22 March 2000]. The general modelling approach is presented here and then illustrated by the analysis of fuel volatilisation in Phebus FPT4 (for which results are not yet available). Effort was made to reduce uncertainties in the calculations by improving the understanding of controlling physical processes and by using critically assessed thermodynamic data to determine uranium vapour pressures. The analysis presented here constitutes a preliminary, blind, post-test estimate of fuel volatilised during the test. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Viswanathan, R; Krishnaiah, MV				Viswanathan, R; Krishnaiah, MV			Vaporization chemistry of hypo-stoichiometric (U,Pu)O-2	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Themodynamics of Nuclear Materials	AUG 06-11, 2000	HALIFAX, CANADA					Calculations were performed on hypo-stoichiometric uranium plutonium di-oxide to examine its vaporization behavior as a function of O/M (M = U + Pu) ratio and plutonium content. The phase U(1-y)PuyOz was treated as an ideal solid solution of (1-y)UO2+yPuO((2-x)) such that x=(2-z)/y. Oxygen potentials for different desired values of y,z, and temperature were used as the primary input to calculate the corresponding partial pressures of various O-, U-, and Pu-bearing gaseous species. Relevant thermodynamic data for the solid phases UO2 and PuO(2-x) and the gaseous species were taken from the literature. Total vapor pressure varies with O/M and goes through a minimum. This minimum does not indicate a congruently vaporizing composition. Vaporization behavior of this system can at best be quasi-congruent. Two quasi-congruently vaporizing compositions (QCVCs) exist, representing the equalities (O/M)(vapor)=(O/M)(mixed-oxide) and (U/Pu)(vapor)=(U/Pu)(mixed-oxide), respectively. The (O/M) corresponding to QCVC1 is lower than that corresponding to QCVC2, but very close to the value where vapor pressure minimum occurs. The O/M values of both QCVCs increase with decrease in plutonium content. The vaporization chemistry of this system, on continuous vaporization under dynamic condition, is discussed.

The longitudinal and shear sound velocities of BaUO3 were measured by an ultrasonic pulse-echo method at room temperature, which enabled us to calculate the elastic properties and the Debye temperature. Microhardness measurements were made for BaUO3 at room temperature using a micro-Vickers hardness tester. These mechanical properties of BaUO3 differed from those of UO2. The thermal conductivity was calculated from the measured density and thermal diffusivity and literature values of heat capacity. The thermal conductivity of BaUO3 was about one-tenth that of UO2. The thermophysical properties of BaUO3 were found to be glass-like rather than like those of typical ceramics. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The solubility of magnesium in Ce0.1U0.9O2+x was about y = 0.05, and above this concentration MgO precipitated, forming a two-phase mixture. In MgyCezU1-y-zO2+x with y less than or equal to 0.05, a part of the dissolved magnesium atoms occupy the interstitial 4b position of Fm (3) over barm. The ratio of the interstitial magnesium to the total magnesium increases from about 0.3 to 0.6 as the oxygen partial pressure decreases to 10(-19)-10(-21) atm. The rates of change of the lattice parameter, partial derivativea/partial derivativey, partial derivativea/partial derivativez and partial derivativea/partial derivativex, for x greater than 0 were somewhat smaller in absolute values than literature values. For x < 0, the rates partial derivativea/partial derivativez and partial derivativea/partial derivativex were in good agreement with the literature values. However, partial derivativea/partial derivativey was much smaller as absolute value due to interstitial magnesium, A plot of oxygen potential vs O/M ratio at 1000 degreesC showed a marked shift to lower x for the MgyCezU1-y-zO2+x solid solution. The shift rate was -0.01 per 1 mol% magnesium, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TC-DTA) showed that the apatite was stable up to about 800 K. The thermal conductivity of the hot-pressed sample, with the theoretical density of 82%, increased gradually with increasing temperature from 0.65 W m(-1) K at room temperature to 0.78 W m(-1) K-1 at 523 K. The micro-Vickers hardness and Youngs modulus were lower than those of a typical glass waste form. The leaching rate of iodine for apatite was two orders of magnitude higher than that of an AgI glass waste form. Despite the high leaching rate (compared to AgI embedded in glass), the high chemical stability up to 800 K and acceptable mechanical properties of this apatite suggest that it will be a good waste form when embedded in a suitable matrix material.

It was found that Pu was soluble to at least 20 mol% in CaTiO3 in Ar-8% H-2. Solubility of Pu in CaTiO3 was extremely limited (below 5 mol%) under oxidizing condition. The thermal expansion of(Ca1-xPux)TiO3 (x = 0-0.15) was investigated in the temperature range from room temperature to 1273 K by high-temperature X-ray diffraction. The linear thermal expansion coefficients showed considerable anisotropy for the orthorhombic Pbnm structure and decreased with increasing Pu content. The structural phase-transition temperatures were estimated from the lattice constants and were relatively insensitive to the content of Pu dopant. The estimated melting point increased with increasing Pu content, indicating that the thermodynamic stability of CaTiO3 increased with the addition of Pu. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.
