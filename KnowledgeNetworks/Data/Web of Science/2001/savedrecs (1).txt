Two materials have been studied: a fire retarding EPR/EVA cable sheathing compound with the thickness of 4.4 mm and a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) (20 mm thick) which was studied for potential use as a material for radioactive waste disposal containers. Both materials have been irradiated using Co-60 gamma-ray source at different dose rates in the interval from 8.5 to 8550 Gy/h. Irradiated samples have been cut into very thin slices and the thermo-oxidative stability (OIT) has been measured using differential scanning calorimeter. In this way the dependence of OIT values on the distance from the surface has been obtained for both samples and at applied dose rates. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This has made intensity modulated electron and photon beams almost as powerful as conventional uniform beam proton therapy. To be able to cure also the most advanced hypoxic and radiation resistant tumours of complex local spread, intensity modulated light ion beams are really the ultimate tool and only slightly more expensive than proton therapy. The aim of the new centre for ion therapy and tumour diagnostics in Stockholm is to develop radiobiologically optimised three-dimensional (3D)-pencil beam scanning techniques. Beside the 'classical' approaches using low ionisation density hydrogen ions (protons, but also deuterons and tritium nuclei) and high ionisation density carbon ions, two new approaches will be developed. In the first one lithium or beryllium ions, that induce the least detrimental biological effect to normal tissues for a given biological effect in a small volume of the tumour, will be key particles. In the second approach, referred patients will be given a high-dose high-precision 'boost' treatment with carbon or oxygen ions during one week preceding the final treatment with conventional radiations in the referring hospital. The rationale behind these approaches is to reduce the high ionisation density dose to the normal tissue stroma inside the tumour and to ensure a microscopically uniform dose delivery. The principal idea of the centre is to closely integrate ion therapy into the clinical routine and research of a large radiotherapy department. The light ion therapy centre will therefore be combined with advanced tumour diagnostics including MR and PET-CT imaging to facilitate efficient high-precision high-dose boost treatment of remitted patients. The possibility to do 3D tumour diagnostics and 3D dose delivery verification with the same PET camera will be the ultimate step in high quality adaptive radiation therapy where alterations in the delivered dose can be performed by subsequent treatments. The increased knowledge in turnout and molecular biology will hopefully further improve the efficiency of this very unique new treatment modality that will be planned and delivered by radio biologically optimised 3D-pencil beam scanning techniques to maximise the complication-free turnout cure and minimise normal tissue side effects. Finally, the design, cost, time scale and treatment capacity of the centre are reviewed. After a few years of running, the centre will be capable of treating 1000 patients/year with light ions and almost 3000 patients/year with the high-precision boost techniques.

The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) modified FRAPCON-3, a U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission-sponsored software package developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory for use on mixed thoria-urania fuels. The modifications constituted the first stage of fuel performance evaluations supported by the Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (NERI) project titled Advanced Proliferation Resistant, Lower fe Cost, Uranium-Thorium Dioxide Fuels for Light Water Reactors. The goal of this NERI project is to develop mixed ThO2/UO2 fuels that can be operated to a relatively high burnup level in current and future commercial power reactors. This paper describes in detail the INEEL's modifications to the FRAPCON-3 thermal conductivity subroutine FTHCON and the techniques used to validate the modifications. The paper presents the general fuel design criteria used to model mixed thoria-urania fuel and a steady-state analysis of a mock thoria-urania fuel using the FRAPCON-3Th code. The paper also presents the data analyses for the mock thoria-urania fuel and offers suggestions for future upgrades and improvements to the code.

A model has been developed regarding the pressure vessel with its auxiliary parts plus the fuel elements as the zone, with the six steam generators as one single unit. The stream from the steam generator is split, with its larger part returning to the zone through the main circulating pump and the smaller one passing through the purifier column. Based on this flowchart, the formation kinetics of corrosion products and of radioactive substances are evaluated. Correlation analysis is applied to reveal any eventual interdependence of the processes, whereas the range-per-scatter (RIS) method is used to characterize the random or deterministic nature of a process. The evaluation of the t --> infinity limits of the kinetic equations enables one to conclude that (a) the total amount of corrosion products per element during one cycle is almost always < 15 kg and (b) the zone acts as a highly efficient filter with an efficiency of similar to 1. The RIS results show that the fluctuations in the concentrations of the corrosion products are persistent; this finding indicates that random effects play here little if any role and that the processes in the coolant are under control. Correlation analyses show that the variations of the concentrations are practically uncorrelated and that the processes are independent of each other.

In this process, the actinide oxides in the spent fuel are reduced using lithium at 650 degreesC in the presence of molten LiCl, yielding the corresponding actinides and Li2O. The actinides are then extracted from the reduction product by means of electrorefining. Associated with the reduction step is an ancillary salt-recovery step designed to electrochemically reduce the Li2O concentration of the salt and recover the lithium metal. Experiments were performed at the laboratory scale (50 to 150 g of fuel and 0.5 to 3.5 l of salt) and engineering scale (3.7 to 5.2 kg of fuel and 50 l of salt). Laboratory-scale experiments were designed to obtain information on the fundamental factors affecting process rates. Engineering-scale experiments were conducted to verify that the parameters controlling process scaleup are sufficiently understood, and to test equipment and operating concepts at or near full scale. All indications are that the electrochemical-based process should be workable at practical plant sizes.

J	Matsuo, T; Yoshida, T				Matsuo, T; Yoshida, T			Influence of finite absorption of radionuclides on radionuclide migration in an engineered barrier system	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							MODELS	This study, which develops a safety assessment code for radioactive waste disposal, consists of two-dimensional analyses of underground water infiltrated flow and nearfield radionuclide migration, one-dimensional analyses of far-field migration, and the dose equivalent. The study takes into account the influence of a finite absorption amount of radionuclides in an engineered barrier system (EBS). The safety assessment code is applied to C-14 migration calculations. The near-field cylindrical model consists of an equally mixed region of wasteforms and backfill, bentonite, and rock. Carbon-14 coexists with 3.1 x 10(6) times as much C-12 in the wasteforms. The distribution coefficient, maximum absorption amount, and solubility of CO32- against the equally mixed region are 3 assumed to be 2.0 m(3)/kg, 3.06 mol/kg, and 544 mol/m(3), respectively. Then, the release rate from the wasteforms (10(-4) to 10(-6)/yr) and underground water detachment period from the wasteforms are examined to lower the dose equivalent by the intake of well water. The C-14 concentration on the EBS boundary is 20 times as large in the case of EBS finite absorption as in the case of infinite absorption. So, the EBS finite absorption leads to absorption saturation and accelerated release of the radionuclides.

J	Williams, DF; Del Cul, GD; Toth, LM; Collins, ED				Williams, DF; Del Cul, GD; Toth, LM; Collins, ED			The influence of Lewis acid/base chemistry on the removal of gallium by volatility from weapons-grade plutonium dissolved in molten chlorides	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								It has been proposed that GaCl3 can be removed by direct volatilization from a Pu-Ga alloy that is dissolved in a molten chloride salt. Although pure GaCl3 is quite volatile (boiling point: 201 degreesC), the behavior of GaCl3 dissolved in chloride salts is quite different because of solution effects and is critically dependent upon the composition of the solvent salt (i.e., its Lewis acid/base character). In this technical note, the behavior of gallium in prototypical Lewis acid and Lewis base salts is contrasted. It is found that gallium volatility is suppressed in basic melts and promoted in acidic melts. These results have an important influence on the potential for simple gallium removal in molten salt systems.

J	del Campo, CM; Francois, JL; Lopez, HA				del Campo, CM; Francois, JL; Lopez, HA			AXIAL: a system for boiling water reactor fuel assembly axial optimization using genetic algorithms	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								A system named AXIAL is developed based on-the genetic algorithms (GA) optimization method, using the 3D steady state simulator code Core-Master-PRESTO (CM-PRESTO) to evaluate the objective function. The feasibility of this methodology is investigated for a typical boiling water reactor (BWR) fuel assembly (FA). The axial location of different fuel compositions is found in order to minimize the FA mean enrichment needed to obtain the cycle length under the safety constraints. Thermal limits are evaluated at the end of cycle using the Haling calculation; the hot excess reactivity and the shutdown margin at the beginning of cycle are also evaluated. The implemented objective function is very flexible and complete, incorporating all the thermal and reactivity limits imposed during fuel design analysis; furthermore, additional constraints can be easily introduced in order to obtain an improved solution. The results show a small improvement in the FA average enrichment obtained with the system related to the reference case that has been studied. The results show that the system converge to an optimal solution, it is observed that the mean fuel enrichment decreases while all the constraints are satisfied. A comparison was also performed using one-point and two-points crossover operator and the results of a sensitivity study for different mutation percentage are also showed.

The application of liquid plutonium-uranium metallic alloys used as a nuclear fuel demonstrated high potential to reach excellent reactor shutdown characteristics against anticipated transients without scram such as unprotected loss-of-flow and unprotected transient overpower. The calculations indicated that the thermal expansion of liquid fuels would cause the negative reactivity insertion that would be larger in magnitude than any other thermally induced reactivity changes. This created the reactivity balance for the passive shutdown and power stabilization capabilities of the MPFR core. It was found that MPFR satisfies such design characteristics to be a potential candidate providing the replacement of fossil fuels by alternative energy sources in the next century.

In the first method a gamma ray activity ratio method was employed. An experimental setup was established for gamma ray scanning using prior calibrated high purity germanium detector. The computer software KORIGEN gave the theoretical support. In the second method reactivity difference technique was used. At the same location in the same core configuration the fresh and burned fuel element's reactivity worth was estimated. For theoretical estimated curve, group cross-sections were generated using computer code WIMS-D/4, and three dimensional modeling was made by computer code CITATION. The measured burnup of different fuel elements using these methods were found to be in good agreement. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The sampler processed hundreds to thousands of liters of natural waters with variable suspended sediment and salinity loads at flow rates of 10-201/min. Extraction of most radionuclides in the water column was accomplished through the combination of physical filtration down to 0.1 mum particle size and chemical separation of dissolved species on cellulose-based inorganic sorbent beds without recourse to complex, or hazardous chemistry. Performance and extraction efficiencies for suites of radioisotopes were deter-mined in the laboratory and in the field with river and coastal ocean water samples. Extraction and recovery efficiencies are better than 90% for most fission and activation product radioisotopes. This methodology has broad application to the study of the distribution and fate of radioisotopes in coastal waterways. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Discharge of the springs is 50-12001 per minute with the surface temperature from 40 to 94 degreesC. Environmental isotopes and chemical concentrations have been used to investigate the origin and subsurface history of thermal water. Four sets of water samples were collected and analyzed for various isotopes including O-18, H-2 and H-3 of water; S-34 and O-18 of dissolved sulphates and chemical contents. Isotopic and chemical data show that the origin of thermal water is meteoric water. On the delta -diagram, delta O-18 and delta H-2 data plotting below the local meteoric water line with a slope around 12.3 show that the original thermal water receives recharge from precipitation at higher altitude (3000m) and undergoes delta O-18 shift of about 1% due to exchange with rocks. Different correlations between isotopes, temperature and Cl indicate that the observed isotopic compositions have evolved due to mixing of different proportions of shallow water at different spring paths during movement of thermal water towards the surface. It is also inferred from the tritium data along with delta O-18 and delta H-2 that the circulation time is long and is estimated to be more than 50 years. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

U is spatially related to both Th and K and the Th/U ratio is on average 3.1-3.5. The magmatic evolution is reflected by the concentration of the three radioelements, as they are more abundant within the more felsic units of the volcanic series. The higher values of U (15.7-20.0 ppm) coincide with higher Th (48.3-65.9 ppm) and K (4.9-6.1 %) concentrations associated with rhyolitic rocks of the third cycle (< 50 ky). The air absorbed dose rate varies from 20 to 470 nGy h(-1). The highest values (> 350 nGy h(-1)) are observed on outcrops of rhyolitic obsidian lava flows. The cosmic-ray contribution is also evaluated to estimate the total background radiation dose rate. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Comparing open and closed nuclear cycles with multiple recycling of plutonium in fast reactors according to the criterion of potential proliferation risk ("exposure risk") shows that the present methodological approach does not confirm the idea that proliferation is of a greater danger in a closed cycle, which has become the foundation for long-time nuclear policy of the US.

In the course of this work, the physical-mechanical and technological characteristics of granular UO2 and UPuO2 fuel were studied, radiation tests and materials-engineering investigations of experimental and test fuel elements were performed in BOR-60, BN-350, and -600 reactors. More than 30,000 fuel elements were fabricated. Maximum burnup similar to30% heavy atoms was attained in BOR-60 using fuel assemblies with the standard construction and 32.3% heavy atoms was obtained using experimental fuel elements with a collapsible fuel assembly. In testing fuel elements with vibrationally compacted UPuO2 in BN-600, maximum burnup of 9.6% (similar to10.8% heavy atoms for individual fuel elements) was achieved. Postreactor investigations showed that the service life of the fuel elements is determined only by the choice of the cladding material. In accordance with the concept developed at the Ministry of Atomic Energy of Russia for the utilization of weapons plutonium, the Institute set about to implement in practice a technology for converting the metallic weapons-grade plutonium into mixed uranium-plutonium oxide fuel on the basis of pyroelectrochemistry and vibrational compaction.

The BWR plant generated approx. 2 million kWh of electricity in 150,000 hours of operation at a gross power of 16 MWe. After the operator, VAK GmbH, had filed an application for decommissioning, the first of four decommissioning permits was issued in 1988. The plant is to be demolished completely so that the site will no longer be within the scope of the Atomic Energy Act. By 2001, demolition work covered by the first decommissioning permit had been finished, also the 2nd and 3rd decommissioning permits had largely been completed, and work under the 4th decommissioning permit had been begun. To acquire technical and organizational experience and know-how, the decommissioning and demolition phases are accompanied by research and development work carried out by the operators and by VAK shareholders RWE and E.ON. After the bulk of the work had been completed, the radioactive inventory had been removed from the plant, and the end of the project was in sight, RWE NUKEM GmbH was commissioned to carry on. The main objectives now are speedy completion of the jobs still to be finished, further development for other projects of the know-how acquired, and job protection. The main work still to be carried out includes dismantling of systems no longer needed and of the biological shield as well as decontamination of building structures accompanied by the clearance of buildings and open areas for subsequent conventional demolition. The waste arising will be packaged in accordance with its classification, and will be removed into interim storage or managed in the conventional way. The project is to be completed in the 3rd quarter of 2006.

J							ILK	ILK statement on the July 5, 2001 Draft Amendment to the German Atomic Energy Act	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								The International Committee on Nuclear Technology (ILK) is an independent body of experts advising the federal states of Baden-Wurttemberg, Bavaria, and Hesse in matters of nuclear safety and radioactive waste management. In a topical statement, ILK evaluates the federal government's draft amendment to the Atomic Energy Act especially with a view to new technical aspects. Here are the main findings of ILK: No re-evaluation of the factors contributing to the risk posed by nuclear power is given by the federal government to explain its termination of the use of nuclear power. Moreover, there is no comparative assessment of the risks associated with different sources of energy. The evaluation of the safety standards of nuclear power by the federal government, which differs considerably from the evaluations by other countries, is detrimental to international cooperation. The draft legislation contains contradictory statements about risk assessment and the consequences to be derived from it. Final storage, reprocessing, and proliferation are topics practically not dealt with at all. The consequences of opting out of the peaceful uses of nuclear power are evaluated and dealt with insufficiently. Accordingly, ILK sees no new reasons, especially no material reasons, for the evaluation of nuclear power in the existing draft legislation.

J	Boning, K				Boning, K			Uranium of high enrichment in FRM-II	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								In recent years neutrons have become increasingly more important also in many areas other than their traditional applications in fundamental research, i.e. industry, environmental technology, and medicine. The Technical University of Munich (TUM) built the new FRM-II neutron source in order to ensure, at the present stage of development, that high-level research and applications will be possible in Germany and for international partners over the next few decades. The technical concept developed, which uses highly enriched uranium (HEU), is the optimum technical solution; other degrees of fuel enrichment discussed in the course of planning turned out to incur a number of disadvantages. The use of low-enriched uranium while retaining the same thermal neutron flux density is associated with grave technical drawbacks in operation and with negative impacts on research possibilities. Another fuel strategy under investigation is the use of a core with medium-enriched uranium (MEU); this is still in a phase of technical development. The EURATOM Treaty and the Non-proliferation Treaty as well as the studies and development programs on non-proliferation conducted with German participation since the seventies support the general understanding that there must be a possibility to operate a number of particular ly powerful high-flux research reactors, such as the FRM-II.

The developed injector, which does not make use of moving parts, is equipped with 20 molybdenum elements coated with titanium for the interim storage of deuterium/tritium in a chemically bound way. Gas generation is accomplished by electrically heating these elements. The pressure of the generated gas flow is comparable to the gas pressure in tokamaks. To feed tokamaks of ITER-FEAT size with deuterium/tritium the individual elements must be replaced by packages of 16 elements. 20 packages constitute a module with a volume of about 3 x 10(-2) m(3). The module can deliver a deuterium flow of 3.7 x 10(-6) kg/s during 100 s or 2 x 10(-6) kg/s during 400 s. The electrical power consumption is estimated to be approx. 2 kW. To maintain the plasma density in a tokamak constant a combination of a single element with packages of elements is proposed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In START NBI, heated plasmas fuelled with deuterium pellets; high normalized density (Greenwald number N-G < 1.1) with good energy confinement time (tau (E)/tau (ITER97)(Eelmf) less than or equal to 1.3) both at high beta (beta (T) less than or equal to 25%, beta (N) less than or equal to 4.9) have been obtained for time scales close to the energy confinement time (similar to tau (E)). In addition, high fuelling efficiency (similar to 100%) have also been simultaneously observed. A complete pellet injection programme is currently under development in MAST, including the commissioning of a eight pellet injector, technical aspects of launching pellets through guide tubes, dedicated diagnostics, and modelling.

The injector can eject trains of up to 40 cubic (1.9 mm)(3) deuterium pellets at frequencies of 1-10 liz and velocities of 0.2-1.0 km/s. Pellet injection experiments into ohmic heating (OH) plasma were performed. From plasma density measurement, central fueling and enhanced fueling rate compared to gas puffing were observed for magnetic low-field side (LFS) injections. The results of HFS injection through the guide tube connected to the upper port of the vessel showed that the pellet velocity exceeding 220 m/s caused. pellet destruction inside the tube.

A detailed assessment of this feed system coupled to the centrifugal launcher has been carried out in a dedicated test bed at Cadarache, to complete and understand the first results obtained at ORNL and to improve them. The results presented in this paper;are related to the study of the pellet trajectory from the deuterium ice cutting to the collection of the accelerated pellets in a guide tube. The overall reliability of the injector has been shown to be very sensitive to deviations in the free flight part of the trajectory, before capture by the rotating launcher.

A novel adaptation of a new 2000 l/s turbo-drag pump has been developed to meet the present and future requirements. Two of these pumps have been installed and are used to pump the torus. These pumps offer a number of advantages, and systems on JET will continue to be upgraded to incorporate such pumps. These should be an effective solution for other large fusion experiments.

Gas chromatography with a cryogenic separation column is one of the most extensively used methods for the analysis of hydrogen isotopes. Micro gas chromatograph (micro GC) with a cryogenic column is expected to improve the analysis time, that is a major disadvantage of conventional GC. The present authors have modified the micro GC to use its separation column at cryogenic temperature. In previous work a micro packed column has been tested and indicated fairly good performance. In this work a capillary column was tested at cryogenic temperature for more improvement of analysis time. Obtained retention time of H(2), HD and D(2) were about 43, 47 and 5.4 s, respectively, for the column with 0.53 mm of I.D., 4.0 m of length and 0.08 mm of film thickness. Peak resolution between H(2) and HD was about 1.12. These results suggest that the column developed in this work attained the practical level for the separation and short analysis time. The estimation of the retention time was carried out using the dispersion model. The retention times of HT, DT and T(2) were also estimated using the reduced. mass. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The resolution of an Omegatron increases with decreasing mass and it can easily discriminate between all the 20 + species of ions between masses 1 and 9, except between T(+) and He(3)(+) ions. The Omegatron is a candidate device for gas analysis, it is small, simple to operate and relatively inexpensive. The disadvantages are the upper pressure limit of about 1.0E - 6 mbar and low output currents, typically less than 1.0E - 11 A, which give slow response times. The Omegatron at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe is well established and has been used successfully for qualitative analyses of tritiated gas mixtures. Quantitative measurements on known gas mixtures up to mass 28 have revealed several anomalies, particularly when helium is present. Work to, explain this effect is reported. The gas in the mass spectrometer has to be a representative sample and be introduced in a reasonable timescale. A potential pumping and expansion arrangement is described. The Omegatron is highly suited to computer control as the cyclotron frequencies of the various ions are precisely known and techniques to control the Omegatron and evaluate the results are proposed.

Therefore, the,getter is necessary for the recovery of the tritium gas on in-pile functional test. In this study, ZrNi alloys added other elements, i.e. Fe, Co, etc. were selected as a getter. The equilibrium hydrogen pressure of these alloys and breakthrough properties of hydrogen with the particle packed bed were estimated for its application. Resulting of the examination on plateau pressure of the P-C-T, the same plateau pressure as the uranium was obtained in the Zr(1)Ni(0.2)Co(0.7)Fe(0.1) and Zr(1)Ni(0.3)Co(0.5)Fe(0.2) in which the pressure was about 4 x 10(-4) Pa at 298 K. The absorption band and amount of hydrogen absorption in the packed bed were about 0.7 cm and 170 cm(3)/g Zr(1)Ni(0.3)Co(0.5)Fe(0.2) in 3 cm/s with 9940 ppm H(2) + Ar gas at 298 K, respectively. From these results, it was obvious that Zr(1)Ni(0.3)Co(0.5)Fe(0.2) was the preferable material for the recovery of tritium gas for in-situ irradiation test of fusion blanket.

The satisfactory structural compatibility of Pb-17Li with SiCf/SiC and the large hydrogen rates through it, suggest the use of a high-porosity-matrix (HPM) 2D-SiCf/SiC as permeator membrane for the recovery of tritium dissolved in Pb-17Li. Uncertainties concerning Pb-17Li with SiCf/SiC interaction are identified in order to analyze the main feasibility issues of SiCf/SiC extractors. For a wide range of operating modes the ideal recovery efficiencies of a HPM 2D-SiCf/SiC column are obtained by the numerical implementation of a general dispersion model. The comparison of the obtained efficiencies with those of the actual bubbling columns demonstrates the potential attractiveness of the proposed extractor concept.

For the first time a laser Raman experiment was assembled with an actively controlled resonator which yields a 50 times higher Raman signal and with all components (laser, optics, Raman cell and spectrometer) installed inside a glove box. Three gas chromatographs, each with up to six detectors, can determine the gases and their tritiated fractions expected in fusion devices down to the sub-ppm range. Tritium in solids, liquids and gases is determined by means of three calorimeters with a dynamic ranges of up to five orders of magnitude and a lower detection limit of 1 GBq. Since any of these techniques has its shortcomings the best analytical approach is to analyse a sample by more than one method. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Due to an original column design, very short cycles can be achieved. A dynamic simulation tool of the TCAP has been developed in order to propose an optimized sequence of production. The simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental results obtained with protium-deuterium separations. Modeling of a ternary system indicates that high purity tritium can be recoverable from a 'poor' mixture. This simulation tool has been applied finally to propose optimized separation sequences.

The process step envisaged for tritium extraction as well as for coolant purification includes a cryogenic cold trap as main component for the removal of tritiated water vapour (mainly HTO, H(2)O). The concentrations of water in the gas streams are expected to be extremely small, i.e. of the order of 10 ppm by volume. In this paper, we describe first rums with a cold trap using helium as the carrier gas at flow rates of 0.1 and 1.0 m(3)/h. The range of water vapour concentration in the helium carrier gas was 0.5 to > 200 ppm(v). The experiments have demonstrated the ability of the cold trap to remove water vapour efficiently from the He stream down to concentrations of less than 0.02 ppm(v) when the inlet water concentration is in the range of 300-650 ppm(v) or higher.

Bipolar electrolysis, based on the electrochemical permeation of hydrogen and its isotopes through Pd-Ag alloy membranes, allows tritiated water enrichment together with negligible gaseous tritium release. Our purpose is to enrich water from 500 Ci/l (1.85 x 10(13) Bq/l) to more than 2000 Ci/l (7.40 x 10(13) Bq/l). We first describe the principle of bipolar electrolysis and its application to isotopic enrichment. The experimental part of this work consists of the determination of the isotopic separation factors. From these experimental values, we simulated the working of an operational cell and we demonstrate the feasibility of the process. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The main parts of the plant are a 100-mm diameter exchange column of 6.9 m overall height, alkaline electrolytic cells and catalytic burners. The separation performance of the column was determined. The computer code makes it possible to carry out the calculation over a wide range of conditions and to forecast a concentration profile within the column when the values of flow rates are changed. The experience gained during the plant operation shows a high efficiency of isotope separation by CECE process and allows regarding CECE process as a considerable promise for the industrial use, in particular, for water purification from tritium.

To enable often complex engineering activities to be performed, a number of novel audio and visual and communications systems have been designed. The paper describes these systems which give freedom of visual and audio communication between suited personnel, supervisors, operators and engineers. The system enhances the safety of the working environment as well as helping to minimise the radiation dose to personnel. It is concluded, from a number of years experience of using the audio and visual communications systems for suited operations, that safety and the progress of complex engineering tasks have been significantly enhanced.

Central to this maintenance approach are the PFC-to-cassette attachments which must be readily assembled/disassembled by remote handling methods and withstand severe mechanical and thermal loading conditions during machine operation. This paper describes the facilities, equipment and methods used to carry out extensive testing of two attachment schemes, shear keys and multi-links, in order to assess their in-service performance and suitability to remote maintenance operations.

A technique based on frequency modulated coherent laser radar (FM CLR) for such remote metrology is described. Since the FM CLR relies on frequency shift to measure distances, the results are largely insensitive to surface reflectance characteristics. Results of measurements in TFTR and NSTX fusion devices using a prototype FM CLR unit, capable of remotely measuring distances (range) up to 22 m with better than 0.1-mm precision, are provided. These results illustrate that the FM CLR can be used for precision remote metrology as weld as viewing,. It is also shown that by conducting Doppler corrected range measurements using the CLR, the motion of objects can be tracked. Thus, the FM CLR has the potential to remotely measure the motion of plasma facing components (PFCs) during plasma disruptions. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

The calculated and experimental data are given on helium and tritium accumulation, swelling, micro-hardness and thermal conductivity. The microstructural investigation results of irradiated beryllium are also presented. It is shown that the rate of helium and tritium accumulation in beryllium in the SM and BOR-60 reactors is high enough, which is of interest from the viewpoint of modeling the working conditions of the DEMO fusion reactor. Swelling of beryllium at irradiation temperature of 70-150 degreesC and neutron fluence of 2.8 x 10(22) cm(-2) (E > 1 MeV) makes up 0.8-1.5%, at 400 degreesC and fluence of 8 x 10(22) cm(-2) (E > 1 MeV) - 3.2-5.0%. Irradiation hardening and decrease of thermal conductivity strongly depend on the irradiation temperature and are more significant at reduced temperatures. All results presented in the paper were analyzed with due account of the supposed working parameters of the DEMO fusion reactor blanket. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.
