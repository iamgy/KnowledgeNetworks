The measurement of surface contamination by an indirect method is subject to various kinds of error depending on the sampling person and consumes much time and effort in the sampling of large nuclear facilities. In this research, an automatic smear sampler is developed to solve these problems. The developed equipment is composed of a rotating sampling part, a sample transferring part, a power supply part a control part, and vacuum part. It improved the efficiency of estimation of the surface contamination level achieved periodically in a radiation-controlled area. Using an automatic smear sampler developed in this research, it is confirmed that radioactive contaminated materials are uniformly transferred to smear paper more than any sampling method by an operator.

The concentrations of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 range from 158.3 to 1087.6, 91.7 to 1218.4, and 473.8 to 1031.3 Bq kg(-1) for glaze, and from 63.5 to 131.4, 55.4 to 106.5, and 386.7 to 866.8 Bq kg(-1) for ceramic tile, respectively. The measured activity concentrations for these radionuclides were compared with the reported data of other countries and with the typical world values. The radium equivalent activities (Ra-eq), external hazard index (H-ex) and internal hazard index (H-in) associated with the radionuclides were calculated. The Ra-eq values of all ceramic tiles are lower than the limit of 370 Bq kg(-1). The values of H-ex and H-in calculated according to the Chinese criterion for ceramic tiles are less than unity. The Ra-eq value for the glaze of glazed tile collected from some areas are >370 Bq kg(-1).

RPL glass is known to be virtually insensitive to neutrons. The aim of the study, was therefore to determine the neutron response of a dosemeter designed to combine n/gamma conversion with RPL detection capability. Monte Carlo calculations as well as measurements using monoenergetic beams and isotopic neutron sources showed this response to be constant, to within 30% in terms of H-*(10), and independent of neutron energy from 250 keV to 10 MeV. For area monitoring, tests carried out in nuclear facilities (around PuO2 glove box and shipping casks containing PWR, MOX spent fuels or vitrified fission product) demonstrated that dosemeter response was accurate to within 15%. where the gamma component of the mixed n,gamma field remained below 1 MeV. When exposed in the Silene reactor simulating a criticality accident (10(17) fissions- liquid U-235-e.g. 1 Gy neutron and 1 Gy photon), the dosemeter exhibited good correlation with reference values and other measurement technologies (again to within 30%). for both neutron and gamma absorbed dose.

Uranium in the ashes of bones was determined by neutron activation analysis. It was found that the uranium concentration in the bones. as a function of A, exhibits a change in its slope at similar to20 ppm-a probable consequence of the malfunctioning of kidneys. The uranium transfer coefficient was obtained and an analytical expression was fitted into the data. thus allowing extrapolation down to low doses. Internal and localized doses were calculated. Absorbed doses exceeded the critical dose. even for the lowest uranium dosage.

Foodstuffs made of fresh-water fish or mushrooms from regions in Sweden of high Cs-137 deposition was ingested together with a (CsCl)-Cs-134-solution mixed with soft drinks. Whole-body countings of Cs-134 and Cs-137 were performed in the Malmo whole-body counter during a period of similar to50 d prior to, and 200-300 d after the ingestion. Urine and faeces were collected the day before and up to 7-10 d after the test meals, and analysed for Cs-134 and Cs-137. No significant difference in the gastrointestinal uptake fraction, f(0) = 0.98 between caesium incorporated into a foodstuff matrix and caesium in ionic form was detected. Cumulated faecal excretion during 7 d after ingestion accounted for 2-3% of the intake. No significant difference in the long-term biological half-time was found between caesium present in a food matrix and in an aqueous solution in any of the volunteers.

A large number of such measurements were per-formed in Belarus in May-June 1986. Owing to the short half-life of 1311 and to the intake and accumulation of caesium radioisotopes (mainly (134)Cls and Cs-137) in the body, the thyroid doses derived from thyroid measurements made after the beginning of June 1986 have so far been often considered to be unreliable. To evaluate the influence of the caesium radioisotopes to the signal recorded by an instrument performing measurement of I-131 activity in the thyroid, a Monte Carlo method was used to calculate the calibration factors of that instrument. These calculations were made for males of six reference ages: newborn, 1, 5, 10 and 15 years old, and adult. The calibration factors were combined with estimated time-dependent intake functions for 1311 and caesium radioisotopes. The fractions of the instrument indications that were due to 1311 in thyroid were thus estimated as a function of the age of the subject that was measured and of the time elapsed since the accident. Using this information when processing the thyroid measurements made in May 1986 would improve the accuracy of the thyroid dose estimates, and may make it possible to use a larger proportion of the thyroid measurements made in June 1986.

The present work involved a Iona-term (1997-2000) passive monitoring of Rn-222 and Rn-220 in the indoor environment of Shillong, Meghalaya. The north-east region of India being a zone of high seismicity, the indoor radon and thoron map of the region will provide a better insight and a valuable database for any study related to radon and thoron anomalies.

Measurements have been done using a multi-element, high sensitive dosemeter system composed of three solid, properly filtered, sintered CaSO4:Dy thermoluminescent detectors, and one low-atomic number, MgB4O7:Dy,Na thermoluminiscencent detector produced at the Vinca Institute. The dosemeters were deployed quarterly I in above ground level at locations within 20 km of the power plants. Twenty urban and suburban measured stations were established. Measurements were carried out over one year period, from the beginning of the summer of 1995 to the end of the spring of 1996. The registered annual absorbed dose in air, from all of the 20 stations, vary from 0.91 to 1.46 mGy a(-1). One of the highest values of the annual absorbed dose was measured at the station near to the plant. i.e. at the place the most exposed to the lighter fly ash from the plant stack, as it was expected. The annual absorbed dose registered at the measuring stations that were selected as a control because they were situated practically away from possible influence of the plants were from 0.91 to 0.98 mGy a(-1) The above values of absorbed doses become very important, by concurrence of the circumstances. because they represent the zero background radiation level before the incidence of depleted uranium over former Yougoslav territory in tire Kosovo region in the spring of 1999. These measured absorbed dose exposures have to be compared with corresponding absorbed dose rates from the natural sources, such as soil having an exposure of 18-93 nGy h(-1) (average 35 nGy h(-1)) according to the UNSCEAR 2000 Report. This investigation has been primarily done in order to check the impact of coal-fired power plants on the background radiation level in its vicinity. According to the experimental results, influence was confirmed both qualitatively and quantitatively.

A computer code was developed for the calculation of microdosimetric spectra, dose and hit probabilities for alpha particles emitted from uniform and non-uniform source distributions in cylindrical and Y-shaped bronchial airway geometries. Activity accumulations at the dividing spur of bronchial airway bifurcations produce hot spots of cellular hits, indicating that a small fraction of cells located at such sites may receive substantially higher doses. While presently available data on in vitro transformation frequencies suggest that the relative biological effectiveness for alpha particles ranges from about 3 to 10, the effect of inhomogeneous activity distributions of radon progeny may slightly increase the radiation weighting factor relative to a uniform distribution. Thus a radiation weighting factor of about 10 may be more realistic than the current value of 20, at least for lung cancer risk following inhalation of short-lived radon progeny.

These models can make use of the full dosimetric information when extracting information on, say, age-at-exposure, protraction or fractionation effects. It is found that irradiation by radon and its progeny does act on the initiating event of carcinogenesis (e.g. mutation), but its dominating effect is via promoting the division of already initiated cells. Data show that the concept of a unit of exposure giving, in an additive way, a unit of lung cancer risk is too limited, while relatively simple mechanistic assumptions described in this article do yield an adequate description of observations. Exposures in epidemiological data sets are measured with error. For various error models it has been shown that likelihood-based techniques of correction work reliably; likewise for biologically based cancer models. When several parameters are allowed to be exposure dependent, for example, initiation and promotion, then their relative importance is influenced.

However, this exposure is the subject of continuing debate concerning the validity of risk assessment and recommendations on how to act in radon-prone areas. The purpose of this contribution is to situate the radon issue in Spain in two very different settings. The first is a uranium mining industry located in Saelices el Chico (Salamanca), which is under strict control of the Spanish Nuclear Safety Council (CSN). We have measured radon concentrations in different workplaces in this mine over a five-year period. The second setting comprises four tourist caves, three of which are located in the province of Cantabria and the fourth on the Canary Island of Lanzarote. These caves are not subject to any administrative control of radiation exposure. Measured air Rn-222 concentrations were used to estimate annual effective doses due to radon inhalation in the two settings, and dose values were found to be from 2 to 10 times lower in the uranium mine than in the tourist caves. These results were analysed in the context of the new European Basic Safety Standards Directive (EU-BSS, 1996).

Nevertheless, local variations in the radiation exposure may differ by orders of magnitude. In this paper, we study a rural area in western Salamanca (Spain) where doses are potentially well above the stated average value. Its geology consists mostly of granite and schist, presenting various uranium mineralisations, some of which were exploited in former years. Water samples, both surface and groundwater, were collected in selected villages and measured by liquid-scintillation spectrometry. Rn-222 in dwellings was determined in dwellings by means of short-term measurements, using Picorad vials and long-term measurements with CR-39 detectors. The committed effective doses to the inhabitants due to indoor Rn-222 and Rn-222 and Ra-226 in drinking water were assessed using the dose conversion factors proposed in the UNSCEAR 2000 report.

However, not all the mass of the mushroom ingested is digested and assimilated completely by man. To analyse the degree of assimilation of the radioactive content of mushrooms, we have carried out culture under controlled laboratory conditions for Pleurotus eryngii mushrooms to which we added known activities of Cs-134, Sr-85 and Pu-239. We then applied the Van Soest method to the fruiting bodies, which were obtained in order to determine the fraction of these radionuclides associated with the major components of the cell that are assimilable by man. Finally, on the basis of the results, we determined the dose due to Cs-137, Sr-90 and Pu239+240 for several mushroom species collected in different natural and semi-natural ecosystems in Spain.

There are about three to four patients per year. A total of 31 patients were treated with a tumour dose in the range of 40-60 Gy using 8 seeds of I-125 each from 1994 to 2002. This study determines the trend of occupational doses received by surgeons, anaesthesiologists and nurses and the dose rate profile around the eves. Only 3% of the 275 persons monitored for Hp(10) have measurable doses with a weighted average of 4 muSv and 7% of the 175 persons monitored for Hp(0.07) have measurable doses with a weighted average of 0.3 mSv. The dose rate is maximum (110 muSv h(-1)) at the point of contact with the eye plaque and reduces to similar to40% on the side of the other eye.

External exposure results from gamma emitter radionuclides existing in the walls, floor and ceiling. Mathematical models can be used to predict external dose rates inside a room, provided the compartment geometry and the radionuclide concentration activities are known. This paper presents a methodology and a computer code for theoretical evaluation of indoor external gamma doses in the air. The room was modelled as three pairs of rectangular slabs of finite thickness. Doses were evaluated by applying a photon transport model, taking into account self-absorption and radiation build-up. Calculations were performed for (40)K, (226)Ra and (232)Th, considering concrete walls. The results obtained show good agreement with those reported in the literature.

The mean activities of Th-232 U-238 and K-40 are 144.18, 29.25 and 267.48 Bq kg(-1) respectively. In situ measurements were also carried out using environmental radiation dosemeter. The linear correlation coefficient was obtained. The average activity of concentration of Th-232 in the present study is 2.5 times higher than the world median value while the activity of U-238 and K-40 were found to be lower. This may be due to the heavy minerals present in the study area. In the present study, the calculated activity ratio (Th/U) is higher than the crustal rocks. This may be due to changes in the crustal composition through time (mafic to felsic) that are reflected by a change in the Th and U abundances in sedimentary rocks, and also increase in carbon content with time resulted in the decrease in U content and increase in Th/U ratio.

The method is based on the Gaussian plume model, in which the plume parameters including the source term exhibit a 'random walk' process. The embedded parameters of the Kalman filter are determined through maximum-likelihood estimation making the filter essentially free of external parameters. The method is tested using both real and simulated radiation monitoring data. For simulated data, the method is shown to retrieve the embedded parameters employed in generating the data and to reconstruct the plume model parameters, including the source term. When tested against experimental radiation monitoring data the method is found accurately to uncover the known source term.

In order to estimate afterwards the lung cancer risk for the workers, the thoron daughter (Pb-212) levels were assessed and the committed effective and lung committed equivalent doses for workers in place. A total of 28 air filter samples were measured by total alpha counting through the modified Kusnetz method, to determine the Pb-212 concentraion. The committed effective dose and lung committed equivalent dose due to Pb-212 inhalation were derived from compartmental analysis following the ICRP 66 lung compartmental model, and ICRP 67 lead metabolic model.

The radioactive characteristics, assumed in depth, are due, in particular, to radon gas, which when released during the therapies in the indoor thermal room, determines exposure for the workers. The preliminary results of the project, the purpose of which is to analyze the totality of thermal springs, are presented. The concentrations, obtained by gamma spectrometry, show a high variability, and are comparable to those in other thermal springs in Italy and abroad. Possible correlations with geophysical factors, such as the temperature and depth of springs, have been investigated. A gedstatistical analysis of the radon data has also been carried out, through the study of the experimental variogram, obtained by kriging one map of the radon concentration: such an approach is useful not only for mapping but also for giving one possible interpretation of the examined phenomenon through structural geologic characteristics.

Measurements were accomplished by gamma spectrometry over large samples of water that were drained in a single place and concentrated by ion exchange resin treatment. More recently a regular, periodical monitoring was started using liquid scintillation measurements. In this manner, gross alpha and beta activities, uranium, Ra-226 and Rn-222 concentrations are determined at present. Nevertheless, a single-point sampling may be not fully representative of the whole Milano aqueduct, significantly extended and fed by a number of wells. As a control, an extended monitoring of the aqueduct was planned and variations of water radioactivity in different Milano areas have been assessed.

The moderators are annular cylinders made of polymethyl methacrylate and steel. The neutron energy spectrum at the reference calibration point was evaluated from the calculations by MCNP-4B and the measurements by the Bonner multisphere spectrometer and the hydrogen-filled proportional counters. The calculated neutron spectra were in good agreements with the measured ones. These fields can provide the realistic neutron spectra similar to those encountered around the glove-boxes of the fabrication process of MOX (PuO2-UO2 mixed oxide) fuel.

The CANEL assembly was set-up at IRSN to produce such neutron fields. It comprises a depleted uranium shell, to produce fission neutrons, then iron and water to moderate them and a polyethylene duct. The new presented CANEL facility is used with 3.3 MeV neutrons. Calculations were performed with the MCNP4C code to characterise this mixed neutron-photon expanded radiation field at the position where calibrations are usually performed. The neutron fluence energy and the direction distributions were calculated and the operational quantities were derived from these distributions. The photon fluence and corresponding ambient dose equivalent were also estimated. Comparison with experimental results showed an overall good agreement.

SIGMA consists of six Am-Be radioactive sources located in a 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 m(3) graphite moderator block. The neutron field at the calibration position, situated at 50 cm from the west surface of the assembly was characterised experimentally and by Monte Carlo calculations. The thermal neutron fluence was determined by the activation of gold foils; the neutron fluence energy distribution above 240 keV was measured with proton recoil spectrometers and the neutron fluence energy distribution from thermal energies to 20 MeV was measured with a Bonner spheres spectrometer. A Monte Carlo simulation of the SIGMA assembly was undertaken using the MCNP4C code, and the calculated neutron fluence energy distribution was compared with the measurements. As a whole, the experimental data and the MCNP calculation are in a good agreement.

These detectors make it possible to exploit the excellent characteristics of the fission reactions for the measurements of high-energy neutrons. Most of the investigations have been carried out at the quasi-monoenergetic neutron beam facility at The Svedberg Laboratory-TSL of the Uppsala University in cooperation with the Khlopin Radium Institute (KRI). The responses of different fission detectors in the neutron energy range 35-180 MeV have been evaluated: a region where the predictive power of available nuclear reaction models and codes is not reliable yet. For neutron energy >200 MeV, the fission-detector responses have been derived from the data of the proton fission cross sections. By using the ratio of the responses of these detectors, a simple and accurate way to evaluate the spectrum hardness can be obtained, thus providing a tool to obtain spectral information needed for neutron dosimetry without the need to know the entire spectrum. Extensive data have been already obtained for the high-energy neutron spectrum from the CERN concrete facility. In the present paper, the measured values of the response ratios for different fissile detectors exposed at the CERN facility are compared with those calculated for the spectra from the same facility and from different altitudes in the atmosphere, respectively.

J	Scherpelz, RI; Traub, RJ; Pryor, KH				Scherpelz, RI; Traub, RJ; Pryor, KH			Methodology for worker neutron exposure evaluation in the PDCF facility design	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th Symposium on Neutron Dosimetry	SEP 28-OCT 03, 2003	Delft Univ Technol, Delft, NETHERLANDS		Delft Univ Technol			A project headed by Washington Group International is meant to design the Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility (PDCF) to convert the plutonium pits from excessed nuclear weapons into plutonium oxide for ultimate disposition. Battelle staff are performing the shielding calculations that will determine appropriate shielding so that the facility workers will not exceed target exposure levels. The target exposure levels for workers in the facility are 5 mSv y(-1) for the whole body and 100 mSv y(-1) for the extremity, which presents a significant challenge to the designers of a facility that will process tons of radioactive material. The design effort depended on shielding calculations to determine appropriate thickness and composition for glove box walls, and concrete wall thicknesses for storage vaults. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) staff used ORIGEN-S and SOURCES to generate gamma and neutron source terms, and Monte Carlo (computer code for) neutron photon (transport) (MCNP-4C) to calculate the radiation transport in the facility. The shielding calculations were performed by a team of four scientists, so it was necessary to develop a consistent methodology. There was also a requirement for the study to be cost-effective, so efficient methods of evaluation were required. The calculations were subject to rigorous scrutiny by internal and external reviewers, so acceptability was a major feature of the methodology. Some of the issues addressed in the development of the methodology included selecting appropriate dose factors, developing a method for handling extremity doses, adopting an efficient method for evaluating effective dose equivalent in a non-uniform radiation field, modelling the reinforcing steel in concrete, and modularising the geometry descriptions for efficiency. The relative importance of the neutron dose equivalent compared with the gamma dose equivalent varied substantially depending on the specific shielding conditions and lessons were learned from this effect. This paper addresses these issues and the resulting methodology.

Nuclei are produced by fragmentation or fission of the impinging heavy ions with energies of similar to1 GeV per nucleon. The major part of the primary beam and the produced nuclei is deposited in the components of the Fragment Separator (FRS) and generates neutron radiation. Thermoluminescence dosemeters (TLDs) ((LiF)-Li-6/(LiF)-Li-7 pairs in PE spheres) were exposed in neutron fields produced by uranium beams with energies between 100 and 1000 MeV per nucleon during an irradiation period in the year 2002. Two-dimensional dose distributions are obtained using these TL measurements in combination with model calculations. The applied model describes the dose distribution as a superposition of dose patterns of 20 single sources equally distributed along the FRS. The single source distribution is based on a measured double differential neutron distribution for a 1 GeV per nucleon uranium beam.

In particular, new spectrometry methods are developed that provide the energy and direction distribution of the neutron fluence from which the reference dosimetric quantities are derived and compared to the readings of dosemeters. The final results of the project will be a comprehensive set of spectrometric and dosimetric data for the workplaces and an analysis of the performance of dosemeters, including novel electronic dosemeters. This paper gives an overview of the project and focuses on the results from measurements performed in calibration fields with broad energy distributions (simulated workplace fields) and on the first results from workplaces in the nuclear industry, inside a boiling water reactor and around a spent fuel transport cask.

This is the perspective in which the development of ASTRID methodology and tool is performed. The methodology maps out, for several reactor types as well as reactor containments, relevant process parameters and indicators, what and how to calculate and a structured way to summarise and conclude on potential source term and likely time projections. A computer tool is proposed to support the methodology, to suite different user situations, both on-site and off-site as well as size of staff, priority and work order. The output from such an assessment is intended to, first, give bases for decisions on necessary urgent protective actions pre-release, and, second, an input for the sophisticated dispersion calculation codes.

It discusses the extent to which current national plans and international advice address the needs of decision makers following contamination of inhabited areas and food production systems. Based on this the following recommendations are made: (1) the issues that will arise at the start of the late phase response to a radioactive release require preparation work in advance of any release; (2) this preparation should consider the adequacy of legislation, technical data and modelling, options for waste storage and disposal, resources for monitoring and implementing clean up; (3) late phase preparedness requires regular exercising and (4) the possibility of terrorist releases adds further emphasis to the need for preparedness for the late phase.

The determination of contamination levels requires accredited laboratories, approved and certified procedures and methods, transparency and above all prompt results, as stakeholders in general cannot afford waiting. Adequate decisions require fixed norms, stable in time, and accepted internationally. Moreover, an effective policy relies on traceability of products as well. There are huge requirements of harmonisation of procedures, traceability of data, database management, priority settings etc. Accredited laboratories tend to make use of reliable techniques but these have been optimised for low radiation levels and high accuracy for routine analyses, often in the framework of radiological surveillance of the territory, drinking waters or the food chain. It is obvious that such procedures, although very accurate and sensitive, are not suited for urgent decisions in crisis situations. Similarly, accredited analysis methodologies may start from large quantities of product in order to decrease limits of detection; however, this involves sometimes long times for drying or chemical treatment, introducing important delays. Furthermore, large quantities of samples would simply result in the saturation of the analytical capabilities of one country. Adequate actions and informed decisions during a nuclear accident will require an analytical infrastructure that individual countries do not have; hence there is a clear need to establish regional collaboration and co-operation. This paper includes an example of such collaborative work and mutual assistance, and also touches on how sharing tools for decision making, analytical resources, sample collection procedures and analysis would promote trust, reliablity in the results, a common approach toward minimizing the effects of a radiological disaster and above all unity. Last but not least, this paper also poses a challenge: Nuclear accident management implies that all responsible parties have to guarantee that decision support systems have access to data and information in the best available and consistent manner. This will not be achieved in an independent and isolated manner.

Progress has been made in recent years towards methodological convergence and cooperation between European teams. Recently, an international comparison was undertaken in SW Scotland in 2002 to evaluate AGS and ground-based methods. Teams from 18 institutions in 10 European countries attended, collecting some 140,000 AGS spectra, with 750 laboratory gamma spectrometry analyses and 120 in situ observations from the ground sites. Comparisons between AGS and ground-based methods have confirmed the validity of AGS protocols. A composite mapping task, where AGS teams recorded data over adjacent parts of a 90 x 40 km(2) area within a few days, confirmed the ability of teams to work together in an effective manner. This paper provides a summary of the results of the exercise. These demonstrate the operational capabilities of European AGS teams and confirm the quantitative nature of the method.

To utilise existing European airborne monitoring capabilities for multilateral assistance in an accident is a complex administrative and technical matter. Several international exercises have been organised demonstrating the capability to cooperate. However, efficient mutual assistance between European countries requires conceptual work, standards and harmonisation of software. A unified radiological vocabulary and data exchange format in XML need to be developed. A comprehensive database is essential for data assimilation. An operations centre is needed for management and planning of surveys.

J	Smart, R				Smart, R			Task-specific monitoring of nuclear medicine technologists' radiation exposure	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							STAFF	Many studies have demonstrated that the exposure of nuclear medicine technologists arises primarily from radioactive patients rather than from preparation of radiopharmaceuticals. However, in order to devise strategies to reduce staff exposure, it is necessary to identify the specific tasks within each procedure that result in the highest radiation doses. An ESM Eberline FH41B-10 radiation dosemeter, which records the ambient dose equivalent rate, was used to monitor the radiation exposure of a technologist and to record the dose rate in muSv per hour every 32 s throughout a working day. The technologist recorded the procedures that were being performed so that the procedures that resulted in higher doses could be identified clearly. The measured doses clearly showed that the major contributions to the technologist's dose were the following: (1) transferring incapacitated patients from the imaging table to a hospital trolley; (2) difficult injections without syringe shields; and (3) setting up patients for gated myocardial scans. The average dose to the technologist from transferring patients after a bone scan was 0.54 muSv, 40% of the total dose of 1.3 muSv for the complete bone scan procedure. The average dose received injecting 900 MBq of Tc-99(m)-HDP using a tungsten syringe shield was 0.57 muSv, but the highest dose was 1.6 muSv, in a patient in whom the injection was difficult. A 0.5 mm lead apron was found to reduce the dose when setting up a patient for a gated stress Tc-99(m)-sestamibi myocardial scan by approximately a factor of 2. The average dose per patient for this task was reduced from 1.1 to 0.6 muSv. It is recommended that staff waiting for assistance with patient transfers stand away from the patient, that tungsten syringe shields be used for all radiopharmaceutical injections and that a 0.5 mm lead apron be worn when attending patients containing high activities of Tc-99(m) radiopharmaceuticals, such as those having myocardial imaging.

A total of 115 representative soil samples were collected from all over the bedrock surface of the island, based on the different lithological units of the study area, sieved through a fine mesh, sealed in 1000 ml plastic Marinelli beakers and measured in the laboratory with respect to gamma radioactivity for a counting time of 18-h each. From the measured spectra, activity concentrations were determined for Th-232 (range from 1.0 X 10(-2) to 39.8 Bq kg(-1)), U-238 (from 1.0 X 10(-2) to 39.3 gq kg(-1)) and K-40 (from 4.0 x 10(-2) to 565.8 Bq kg(-1)). Gamma absorbed dose rates in air outdoors were calculated to be in the range from 1.1 X 10(-2) to 51.3 nGy h(-1), depending on the geological features, with an overall mean value of 8.7 nGy h(-1) and a standard deviation of 8.4 nGy h(-1). This value is by a factor of about seven below the corresponding population-weighted world-averaged value of 60 nGy h(-1) and one of the lowest that has been reported from similar investigations worldwide. Assuming a 20% occupancy factor, the corresponding effective dose rates outdoors equivalent to the population were calculated to be between 1.3 x 10(-2) and 62.9 muSv y(-1), with an arithmetic mean value of 10.7 muSv y(-1) and a standard deviation of 10.3 pSv y(-1).

The reference method for red marrow dosimetry in radiometabotic therapy is based on the measurement of radioiodine kinetics, particularly the activity/time curve in blood. Such a measurement requires withdrawal of blood samples at various times after I-131 administration. This procedure involves some potential risk from the radiation protection point of view, such as possible contamination of personnel with blood and disposal of the radioactive blood samples (and syringes). We present here a minimally invasive method to evaluate radioiodine kinetics in the blood, which only requires one blood sample and a set of measurements,on the patient's thigh made with a collimated Nal(TI) probe. The method has been validated in four patients treated with I-131 for thyroid cancer.

These companies mainly carry out radiography in open areas using Ir-192 radioactive sources, ranging from 0.07 to 3 TBq (2-80 Ci). The radiation accidents that occurred in these companies led to acute radiation syndrome in 13 workers and overexposure of 36 workers since 1998. The facilities and operating procedures of the Iranian private IRCs have been investigated during the past 5 y. According to this study, in spite of the fact that most of the accidents were found to be due to the failure of critical components of GRDs, the main parameters affecting overexposures and deterministic effects were found to be incorrect or there was insufficient implementation of the monitoring programme, training and local rules in the IRCs.

It also has the highest radiation-induced cancer incidence risk factor of any organ (although mortality is very low). The ICRP and NCRP have, particularly over the past 15 y, been able to set dose limits for the exposure of the skin on the basis of an extensive body of radiobiological, clinical and epidemiological data. Some of the main advances in skin dose limitation in radiological protection and some of the remaining unresolved issues are reviewed.

J	James, AC; Birchall, A; Akabani, G				James, AC; Birchall, A; Akabani, G			Comparative dosimetry of BEIR VI revisited	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							RADON DECAY PRODUCTS; LUNG; PROGENY; EXPOSURE; HOMES	The BEIR VI Committee applied recent developments in the comparative dosimetry of radon exposures in mines and homes to evaluate the so-called K-factor used to extrapolate the excess relative risk of lung cancer determined for underground uranium miners to exposures in homes. This paper describes methodological aspects of these developments that were specified ambiguously in the BEIR VI report. Specifically, in the section dealing with dosimetry (Appendix B of the BEIR VI report), the K-factor was unusually defined in terms of exposure to radon gas (K-gas), and not in terms of exposure to potential alpha energy (K). An incorrect value of unity was calculated for K-gas. This implies a value of 0.44 for K. In this paper, we describe how application of the ICRP Publication 66 lung and dosimetric models to evaluate the regional lung dose per unit exposure to potential alpha-energy in mines and homes yields the value of K = unity. This confirms the BEIR VI Committee's choice of K = 1 for application in their risk extrapolation model. The paper also reviews the use of doses to specific sub-cellular targets in the evaluation of K. This yields a somewhat greater divergence in the corresponding estimates of K, but again an overall average value of K = unity. The paper describes the methods used to calculate alpha particle hit probabilities for specific subcellular targets, and the resulting estimates of single- and multiple-hit probabilities obtained for exposures in mines and homes, as a function of the respective exposure rates.

Parameters affecting the determination of absorbed dose to cells in the shape of a small cell pellet in a centrifuge tube, irradiated by 28 keV mono-energetic photons from a synchrotron, were investigated. Thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD), diode and ion chambers were utilized to monitor the irradiations. The distribution of the absorbed dose and such parameters as scatter, attenuation and interface dosimetry in the target, which influence the dose, were studied. A method for inter-calibrations of two different calibration sources by using TLD and TLD readers is given. Characteristics of the TLD, that is, fading, supralinearity, energy response, self-attenuation and mini-dosimetry were considered for the dosimetry. A method for correcting photon fluence attenuation in cylindrical TLDs is presented. The study shows that the absorbed dose to cells irradiated at low photon energy at a synchrotron irradiation facility can, using accurate dosimetry protocol, be correctly and reproducibly determined.

In the western trace of the Chernobyl accident, the measurement of airborne I-131 fractions (aerosol-associated, gaseous reactive and gaseous organic) indicates that airborne gaseous reactive and, especially, organic I-131 fractions were the major contributors to thyroid exposure due to inhalation. The contribution of inhaled short-lived radioiodines was negligible. To attain more precise thyroid exposure evaluation, 1 31 1 dose factors were determined as a function of age and prevalence of stable iodine deficiency. The results demonstrate that children with a stable iodine deficiency experienced at least two times higher thyroid doses than did children with a dietary iodine sufficiency. The results of these investigations demonstrate that in thyroid dosimetry it is important to know the stable iodine status as well as to have a standardised method for airborne radioiodine measurements, especially for consideration of stable iodine prophylaxis based on the inhalation exposure pathway.

Intakes of radioiodines, mainly I-131 in milk, were the principal sources of radiation doses to thyroids of residents of the contaminated areas, but those radionuclides decayed before detailed contamination surveys could be performed. As a result, Cs-137 deposition density is the primary measure of the contamination due to the accident and there are relatively few measurements of the ratio of I-131 to Cs-137 in vegetation or soil samples from this area. Although many measurements of radiation emitted from the necks of residents were performed and used to estimate thyroidal I-131 activities and thyroid doses, such data are not available for all subjects. The semi-empirical model was selected to provide a dose calculation method to be applied uniformly to cases and controls in the study. The model was developed using dose estimates from direct measurements of I-131 in adult thyroids, and relates settlement average thyroid doses to Cs-137 contamination levels and ratios of I-131 to Cs-137. This model is useful for areas where thyroid monitoring was not performed and can be used to estimate doses to exposed individuals. For application to children in this study, adjustment factors are used to address differences in age-dependent intake rates and thyroid dosimetry. Other individual dietary factors and sources (private/public) of milk consumed are reflected in the dose estimates. Countermeasures that reduced thyroid dose, such as cessation of milk consumption and intake of stable iodine, are also considered for each subject. The necessary personal information of subjects was obtained by interview, most frequently of their mothers, using a questionnaire developed for the study. Uncertainties in thyroid dose, estimated using Monte Carlo techniques, are presented for reference conditions. Thyroid dose estimates for individual children made using the semi-empirical model and questionnaire data compare reasonably well with dose estimates made for 19 children whose thyroid burdens of I-131 were measured from May to June 1986.

J	Mokobia, CE; Balogun, FA				Mokobia, CE; Balogun, FA			Background gamma terrestrial dose rate in Nigerian functional coal mines	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							RADIOACTIVITY	Measurements of the background terrestrial gamma radiation dose rates at different indoor and outdoor locations on the surfaces of Okpara underground and Okaba open cast mines in Nigeria were made. Two duly calibrated low-level gamma survey metres were held I in above the ground surface for these measurements. Measurements were also made at various locations inside the mine tunnel at the Okpara mine. Results indicate that the indoor background gamma radiation is comparable for both mining environments. The mean outdoor gamma dose rate determined for the Okaba mining environment is 10.4 nGy h(-1) as against 11.7 nGy h(-1) for Okpara. The ranges are 8.5-16.5 nGy h(-1) for the Okpara measurements and 7.5-14.0 nGy h(-1) for Okaba. Thus, the outdoor gamma dose rates appear to be generally lower at the Okaba open cast mine than at Okpara. The indoor dose rate values range from 11.0 to 17.0 nGy h(-1) in both environments. These indoor measurements have nearly the same mean values 14.4 and 14.5 nGy h(-1) for Okpara and Okaba environments, respectively. The indoor to outdoor dose rate ratio is 1.2 for Okpara and 1.4 for Okaba. These values are in consonance with the corresponding ratio given in literature. Dose rate measurements inside the mine tunnel at the Okpara mine are higher than the surface indoor measurements ranging from 13.5 to 20.5 nGy h(-1) with a mean of 16.5 nGy h(-1). The higher dose rate values measured in the mine tunnel are attributable to the concentration of radon in the 'closed' environment of the mine tunnel.

The average consumption of these is 0.36 1 d(-1) per person in Europe. A considerable segment of the population drinks almost only mineral water as drinking water, which is about 1 l d(-1). As is known, some kinds of mineral waters contain naturally occurring radionuclides in higher concentration than the usual drinking (tap) water. The WHO (1993) legislation concerning the drinking waters does not include the mineral waters. In our work, the concentrations of Ra-226, U-238 and Po-210 were determined in mineral waters available in Hungary. To determine the Ra-226 concentration the emanation method was used. The U-238 and Po-210 concentrations were determined by alpha spectrometry using semiconductor detector. The dose contribution was calculated using the radionuclide concentrations and the dose conversion factors from the Basic Safety Standard IAEA (1995), for 11 d(-1) mineral water consumption. In some cases the calculated doses were considerable higher than the limit for drinking waters. Especially for children the doses can be remarkably high.
