USTUR Case 1002 was an adult male who died from an acute cerebellar infarct at the age of 83. He worked as a power operator, utility operator, and metal operator for 28 years in a facility that processed and handled radioactive materials. Although he suffered a number of burns from hot metal and acids, cuts, abrasions, and puncture wounds during his many years of work, there were no corresponding health physics or medical records to indicate that these occurrences needed or required excision or decontamination due to the suspicion of the deposition of radioactive material. Over the course of his employment, USTUR Case 1002 submitted numerous urine samples for uranium, plutonium, and fission product analysis. The highest single uranium value measured during this time period was similar to30 mug L-1 recorded during the second year of his employment. A urinary bioassay sample taken before termination of employment measured 43 mug L-1. The mean urinary uranium concentration per liter per year calculated from the employee's bioassay records covering the first eleven years of monitoring averaged less than 3 mug L-1. The ratio of U-234/238 activity in the lung tissue was about 1, the same as that found in natural uranium. The highest concentration of uranium was found in a tracheobronchial lymph node. The uranium content in the various tissues of the body followed a rank order lung > skeleton > liver > kidney. Concentration of uranium in the kidney tissue was similar to1.98 ng g(-1), about 3 orders of magnitude less than the generally accepted threshold level for permanent kidney damage of 3 mug U g(-1) and roughly equal to the 1.4 ng g(-1) reported for Reference Man. The autopsy disclosed findings not uncommon in the aged: severe atherosclerosis, areas of sclerotic kidney glomeruli with stromal fibrous scarring, and moderate to severe arterio-nephrosclerosis. Lung sections contained parenchymal areas of acute vascular congestion and a mild degree of anthracosis.

A fission-track technique has been applied for the estimation of the uranium concentration in drinking water collected from natural springs of Muzaffarabad and hilly areas of Reshian, Azad Kashmir. The technique involved simultaneous irradiation with thermal neutrons of a sample and a standard in contact with a track detector, and the counting of the fission tracks in the detector from the (n, f) nuclear reaction. Uranium concentrations of the samples were determined by comparing fission-track density with that of a standard of known uranium concentration. Uranium concentration in water samples from the Muzaffarabad and Reshian area varied from 0.03 (+/-) 0.01 mugL(-1) to 6.67 +/- 0.14 mugL(-1) with an average of 1.36 +/- 0.05 mugL(-1). The observed concentrations of uranium in drinking water were found to be less than the Maximum Acceptable Concentration levels of 9-30 mugL(-1). Thus, the observed values are within safe limits as far as uranium related health hazards are concerned.

It is clear that the fertilizers vary widely in their heavy metals and uranium content. A shielded high purity germanium HPGe detector has been used to measure the natural concentration of U-238, Th-232, and K-40 activities in the phosphate fertilizer and its components collected from Abu-Zaabal fertilizers and chemical industries in Egypt. The concentration ranges were 134.97-681.11 Bq kg(-1),125.23-239.26 Bq kg(-1), and 446.11-882.45 Bq kg(-1) for U-238, Th-232, and K-40, respectively. The absorbed dose rate and external hazard index were found to be from 177.14 to 445.90 nGy h(-1) and 1.03 to 2.71 nGy y(-1), respectively. The concentrations of 22 elements (Be, Na, Mg, Si, P, S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Zr, Mo, Cd, Ba) in the samples under investigation were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical-emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The results for the input raw materials (rock phosphate, limestone and sulfur) and the output product as final fertilizer are presented and discussed.

The data, representing calendar year 1999 inspection activities, were then analyzed and the results compared to previously published studies for the same year in the states of Texas and Maine. Despite significant differences in regulatory program size, age, and geographic proximity, the most frequently cited violation for radioactive materials licensees were shown to be similar for all three states. Of particular note were the violations that were identified to be consistently issued in all three states. These included physical inventories and utilization logs not performed, not available, or incomplete; leak testing not performed or not performed on schedule; inadequate or unapproved operating and safety procedures; radiation survey and disposal records not available or incomplete; detection or measurement instrument calibration not performed or records not available; and radiation surveys or sampling not performed or performed with a noncalibrated instrument. Comparisons were made in an attempt to generate a summary of the most commonly issued violations that could be generalized to users of radioactive materials across the United States. A generalized list of common violations would be an invaluable tool for radiation protection programs, serving to aid in the reduction of the overall instance of program non-compliance. Any reduction in instances of non-compliance would result in the conservation of finite public health resources that might then be directed to other pressing public health matters.

Materials and methods : The microdistribution of 210 Pb-supported 210 Po and 226 Ra in 708 deciduous and permanent teeth and 32 foetal teeth was measured on 1442 TASTRAK alpha -particle track detectors. Results : Of the various findings, a number are of special interest. Around half of the 210 Pb activity in the outer enamel of deciduous teeth appears to have been acquired in utero as a result of transplacental transfer. In deciduous and permanent teeth, 226 Ra is concentrated mainly in the circumpulpal region, while the highest levels of 210 Po are on the highly calcified outer enamel surface. Furthermore, activity concentrations recorded on this surface were ln-normally distributed. Conclusions : 210 Pb-supported 210 Po activity on the outer enamel surface of permanent teeth constitutes an assay of cumulative environmental exposure with which to assess exposure in bone, both in utero and in childhood.

These fissionable fuels inserted as micro spheres into the first range quadratic channels at the immediate neighborhood of the first wall in the inboard blanket to amplify fusion power and breed fissile fuel. Neutron transport calculations were performed with the help of the SCALE4.3 system by solving the Boltzmann transport equation with the XSDRNPM code in 238 neutron groups and a S-8-P-3 approximation. Among the investigated fuels, UN showed the best neutronic performance while UO2 and U3Si2 had similar performances. Numerical results pointed out that inserting fissionable fuel zone even with a small thickness (10 cm) in a pure fusion reactor increased fusion power from 2170 MW to 4500, 5250 and 4150 MW depending on the fuel type. Furthermore significant amount of fissile fuel was produced to be charged to light water reactors.

For the first time, in situ (underwater) X-ray reflectometry has been used to investigate the alteration of this nuclear glass. A morphological evolution of alteration films is proposed and related to different steps of alteration kinetics. Initially a de-alkalinized glass layer is obtained, followed by the formation of a gel having an open porosity. Subsequently the gel densifies as the glass alteration rate decreases and finally the pore size increases upon formation of a dense and thin zone within the film. The latter dense zone within the gel could constitute a diffusive barrier. This hypothesis is also discussed for simplified glass gels. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An experiment of hydrogen (H-2) and deuterium (D-2) permeation was performed to obtain permeability of H, and D-2 of Hastelloy XR, which is adopted as heat transfer pipe of an intermediate heat exchanger of the HTTR. Permeability of H-2 and D, of Hastelloy XR were obtained as follows. The activation energy E-0 and pre-exponential factor F-0 of the permeability of H-2 were E-0 = 67.2 +/- 1.2 U mol(-1) and F-0 = (1.0 +/- 0.2) x 10(-8) m(3)(STP) m(-1) s(-1) Pa-0.5, respectively, in the pipe temperature ranging from 843 K (570 degreesC) to 1093 K (820 degreesC). EO and F-0 of the permeability of D-2 were respectively Eo = 76.6 +/- 0.5 kJ mol(-1) and F-0 = (2.5 +/- 10.3) x 10(-8) m(3)(STP) m(-1) s(-1) Pa-0.5 in the pipe temperature ranging from 943 K (670 degreesC) to 1093 K (820 degreesC).

The effect of the evolution is examined from viewpoints of fuel restructuring, gaseous FP release and retention and cesium migration behaviors. Its thermal impact on fuel pin performance is also studied by one-dimensional steady state thermal analysis. Threshold condition of the evolution depends on fuel pellet characteristics. burnup and probably temperature. The evolution directly relates to as-fabricated microstructures and to gaseous FP release and retention behavior. A comparison of fuel restructuring with predicted temperature profiles indicates that. even where large residual gaps are observed, non-gaseous filler always improves the heat transfer across the gaps.

J	Ahn, J				Ahn, J			An environmental impact measure for nuclear fuel cycle evaluation	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Nuclear Engineering	APR 20-23, 2003	Tokyo, JAPAN	Japan Soc Mech Engineers, Amer Soc Mech Engineers		environmental impacts; measure; repository capacity; compartment model		Review of the models and measures for repository performance assessment has revealed that dedicated measures for environmental impacts need to be developed for the purpose of nuclear-fuel-cycle evaluation from the viewpoint of environmental impact minimization. The present study proposes the total toxicity index of released radionuclides that have accumulated in the region exterior to the repository as an environmental impact measure. The measure is quantitatively evaluated by a radionuclide transport model that incorporates the effects of canister-array configuration and the initial mass loading in the waste canister. With the measure, it is demonstrated that the environmental, impact of the repository can be effectively reduced by reduction of the initial mass loading and change in the canister-array configuration in the repository. Environmental impacts of the mill tailings and the depleted uranium are as important as those from the high-level radioactive wastes repository. For a fair comparison of various fuel cycles, the sum of these impacts should be compared.

A simplified PUREX process, with the addition of a uranium crystallization step and a minor actinide (MA) recovery process was proposed as the NEXT process. For the simplified PUREX process and the SETFICS/TRUEX process for MA recovery, small-scale hot tests were conducted. The test results showed the decontamination factor (DF) of 10(5) for the U, Pu and Np product was a reasonable target for the simplified PUREX process. Concerning to the Am and Cm product, the DF of rare earth elements (REs) and the other fission products (FPs) were over 10 and over 10(2), respectively. For economical competitiveness, an aqueous reprocessing plant with the capacity of 200 tHM/yr cleared the target cost, while the plant with the capacity of 50 tHM/yr did not clear it. For efficient utilization of resources, the calculated U and TRU recovery of both plants was over 99 wt%. Using salt-free reagents and repeating concentration of waste Solutions, the environmental impact was reduced. Pu was not isolated through the whole processes in the NEXT process in order to keep the proliferation resistance.

An engineering system to support the decommissioning is being developed to create a dismantling plan using state-of-the-art software such as 3-dimensional computer aided design (3D-CAD) and virtual reality (VR). In particular, an exposure dose evaluation system using VR has been developed and tested. The total system can be used to quantify radioactive waste, to visualize radioactive inventory, to simulate the dismantling plan, to evaluate workload in radiation environments aid to optimize the decommissioning plan. The system will also be useful for educating and training workers and for gaining public acceptance.

J	Jones, SR; Lambers, B; Stevens, A				Jones, SR; Lambers, B; Stevens, A			Disaggregation of collective dose - a worked example based on future discharges from the Sellafield nuclear fuel reprocessing site, UK	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article								Collective dose has long been advocated as an important measure of the detriment associated with practices that involve the use of radioactivity. Application of collective dose in the context of worker protection is relatively straightforward, whereas its application in the context of discharges to the environment can yield radically different conclusions depending upon the population groups and integration times that are considered. The computer program PC-CREAM98 has been used to provide an indicative disaggregation into individual dose bands of the collective dose due to potential future radioactive discharges from the nuclear fuel reprocessing site at Sellafield in the UK. Two alternative discharge scenarios are considered, which represent a 'stop reprocessing early, minimum discharge' scenario and a 'reprocessing beyond current contracts' scenario. For aerial discharges, collective dose at individual effective dose rates exceeding 0.015 muSv y(-1) is only incurred within the UK, and at effective dose rates exceeding 1.5 muSv y(-1) is only incurred within about 20 km of Sellafield. The geographical distribution of collective dose from liquid discharges is harder to assess, but it appears that collective dose incurred outside the UK is at levels of individual effective dose rate below 1.5 muSv y(-1), with the majority being incurred at rates of 0.002 muSv y(-1) or less. In multi-attribute utility analyses, the view taken on the radiological detriment to be attributed to the two discharge scenarios will depend critically on the weight or monetary value ascribed to collective doses incurred within the differing bands of individual dose rate.

The requirement for the use of BPM is in order to ensure that doses from discharges are as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP). This facet is increasingly becoming the principal feature of discharge authorisations issued by the Environment Agencies under the Radioactive Substances Act, 1993 (RSA 93), which are enforceable by law. It is important to state at the outset, however, that scientific assessments to date indicate that there are no expectations of environmental harm from authorised discharges, even where those discharges have historically been up to two orders of magnitude higher than current levels. There is also no evidence to indicate that foreseeable future discharges from the Sellafield site will make any contribution to environmental harm.

J	Nancarrow, DJ; White, MM				Nancarrow, DJ; White, MM			Radioactive waste disposal implications of extending Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act to cover radioactively contaminated land	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article								A short study has been carried out of the potential radioactive waste disposal issues associated with the proposed extension of Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to include radioactively contaminated land, where there is no other suitable existing legislation. It was found that there is likely to be an availability problem with respect to disposal at landfills of the radioactive wastes arising from remediation. This is expected to be principally wastes of high volume and low activity (categorised as low level waste (LLW) and very low level waste (VLLW)). The availability problem results from a lack of applications by landfill operators for authorisation to accept LLW wastes for disposal. This is apparently due to perceived adverse publicity associated with the consultation process for authorisation coupled with uncertainty over future liabilities. Disposal of waste as VLLW is limited both by questions over volumes that may be acceptable and, more fundamentally, by the likely alpha activity of wastes (originating from radium and thorium operations). Authorised on-site disposal has had little attention in policy and guidance in recent years, but may have a part to play, especially if considered commercially attractive. Disposal at BNFL's near surface disposal facility for LLW at Drigg is limited to wastes for which there are no practical alternative disposal options (and preference has been given to operational type wastes). Therefore, wastes from the radioactively contaminated land (RCL) regime are not obviously attractive for disposal to Drigg. Illustrative calculations have been performed based on possible volumes and activities of RCL arisings (and assuming Drigg's future volumetric disposal capacity is 950 000 m(3)). These suggest that wastes arising from implementing the RCL regime, if all disposed to Drigg, would not represent a significant fraction of the volumetric capacity of Drigg, but could have a significant impact on the radiological capacity with respect to Ra-226 plus Th-232. The government's decision-making programme for managing solid radioactive wastes in the UK may possibly achieve a general consensus that the use of landfill for LLW from the RCL regime has a fundamental role to play. However, this is unlikely to change the situation within the next few years. No new national facility arising from this programme is likely to be available during the first decade of the operation of a new RCL regime. Hence it appears that Drigg will need to play an important role for some years to come.

Various pressurization levels were imposed and rupture times were noted. The data enabled an evaluation of Larson-Miller parameter and the present experimental results on Zircaloy-4 were in excellent agreement with those reported in the literature. The effect of 1% Nb addition to Zircaloy-4 was studied since these materials are now known to resist long-time corrosion in water reactors and are thus considered for high burn-up applications. Negligible differences were noted in the rupture characteristics between the standard Zircaloy-4 and Nb-added Zircaloy-4. In addition, a limited amount of testing was performed to characterize the hoop creep behavior of these materials using a creep tester with hoop strain monitored in situ by a Laser telemetric extensometer. Both the alloys followed an exponential stress variation of the creep-rate at high (>10(-3) E, E is the elastic modulus) stresses. At very low stresses, viscous creep was noted identifiable with Coble creep corresponding to small grain sized materials. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

During this time, an extensive study was conducted to characterize the neutron field in order to assure the accuracy and reliability of neutron fluence. Neutron flux for a given irradiation test was calculated using a core management code system based on three-dimensional diffusion theory. It was then corrected with the adjusted neutron spectrum by means of the multiple foil activation method. The neutron fluence calculation accuracy in the fuel region was evaluated within a 5% error by comparing the burn-up of spent fuel with the measured values, which had been obtained from their post-irradiation examination. At positions away from the fuel region, the neutron flux distribution was calculated using a two-dimensional transport code. A Monte Carlo code was also used to analyze the detailed neutron flux distribution within an irradiation test subassembly that had a heterogeneous internal structure. With the neutron flux results various irradiation parameters, such as displacement per atom (dpa) and helium production, could be evaluated. A helium accumulation fluence monitor has been developed to measure not only neutron fluence, but also helium production. Neutron flux and fluence obtained from the core management calculations were compiled as a database for users' convenience together with related irradiation information and fuel subassembly material compositions. These data are expected to be widely used in the post-irradiation analysis of fuel and structural material. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Its integrity must be demonstrated all along the fuel rod irradiation with increasing strenuous operating conditions. This paper deals with a study made with Electricite de France (EDF) in order to improve the understanding and modelling of the thermomechanical behaviour of fuel rods under these more arduous conditions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the separate influences of structural and material parameters variability on Pellet-Cladding Interaction (PCI). The following parameters have been tested by 3D simulations for a common ramping condition: axial and radial pellet cracks numbers, pellet fragment size, relative fragments displacement, non-symmetrical configuration, pellet-pellet friction and pellet-cladding friction. The second part of the article deals with the development of a model, which gives a better assessment of cladding stress concentration near radial fuel cracks. The implementation in the 1D fuel rod EDF code CYRANO3 and the validation of the model are presented. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Stopping power values were determined and (as no previous experimental data around the stopping power maximum existed) compared to the available semiempirical codes SRIM 2000, SRIM 2003, ATIMA and MSTAR. The experimental data seems to favor the new SRIM 2003 approach and will hopefully provide input to a further improvement of the parameter set. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The goal was to study N-fractionation in black shales during diagenesis and contemporaneous hydrothermalism. Light elements (N, C) together with heavier ones (K, Ca, Ni, Fe, Zn) were analyzed by PIXE. Due to the heterogeneous sample composition, a scanning mode was used. Each phase was identified before extracting the corresponding spectra for quantification. Six phases, carrying nitrogen (and C), have been identified. K-feldspars are the richest in N (1.0-2.4 wt.%), followed by organic carbon (0.67 wt.%). Quartz, biogenic and abiogenic sulfides and phosphates contain N in the range of 0.56-1.08 wt.%. The present N-distribution in the black shales is explained by a two-step nitrogen release: (1) organic matter decay produces N, P, S nutriments for the development of a hydrothermal vent fauna and (2) biomineralization of this vent fauna liberates nitrogen to early diagenetic fluids. The extreme N enrichment of feldspars is related to its crystal structure, favoring the potassium substitution by NH4+, and the N-uptake during organic matter replacement. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The contribution of the nuclear interfering elements - Hg and Pt - to the concentration of gold in the samples is minimum in the case of the nuclear reactions Au-197(n, 2n)Au-196, Au-197 (n, 2n)Au-196m and Au-197(n, n')Au-197m. As regards the spectral interferences, these are minimum in the case of using the reactions Au-197(n, n')Au-197m and Au-197 (n, 2n)Au-196 and are due to Rb, Ti and V for the short irradiation and to Se for the long irradiation. We propose two methods of gold determination in auriferous alluvial sands and rocks in the range 20-2500 ppm - the minimum value of 20 ppm being at the level of an economic extraction - in the optima conditions established by us so that the systematic errors of analysis due to the gold accompanying elements should be considerably diminished: a method using short irradiation (25 s) and NaI(T1) spectrometry for the measuring of the induced gamma radioactivity in the samples and a method using long irradiation (3000 s) and Ge(Li) spectrometry. The data presented in this paper can be adapted by other analysts to the rapid determination of gold in a variety of alluvial sands and rocks. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Most of the systems of RPWR can employ those of PWRs. The RPWR has no boric acid systems and has a small tritium removal system. The construction and operation costs would be similar to those of current PWRs. Heavy water cost has decreased drastically with up-to-date producing methods. The reliability of the systems of the RPWR is high, and the research and development cost for RPWR is very low because the core design is fundamentally based on the current PWR technology.

The SSR is a new type of water rod in which a water level is naturally developed during operation and changed according to the coolant flow rate through the channel. By taking advantage of the large size of the ABWR-II bundle, the enhanced spectral shift operation by eight SSRs allows operation of the ABWR-II with all control rods withdrawn. In addition, the uranium-saving factor of 6 to 7% relative to the reference ABWR-II core with conventional water rods can be expected due to the greater effect of spectral shift. The combination of these advantages means the ABWR-II with SSRs should be an attractive alternative for the next-generation nuclear reactor.

The HCBWR can be improved by the use of island-type fuel, which has mixed-oxide rods in the bundle interior and uranium rods only in the small region of the periphery, to have inherently negative void coefficient (i.e., negative void coefficient in infinite lattice configuration). The proposed reactor concept also has the sustainability to extend the light water reactor's period by similar to180 yr and the compatibility with a conventional BWR system such that only substitution of fuel bundles and control rods is required. As an example case, the high-conversion advanced boiling water reactor II (ABWR-II) is evaluated.

This flexibility is due to an uncoupling between the parameters of cooling geometry and the parameters that characterize neutronic optimization (moderation ratio or heavy nuclide concentration and distribution). Among other advantageous features, an HTR core has a better neutron economy than a light water reactor (LWR) because there is much less parasitic capture in the moderator (capture cross section of graphite is 100 times less than the one of water), in internal structures, and in fission products (because of a harder spectrum). Moreover, thanks to the high strength of the coated particles, HTR fuels are able to reach very high burnups, far beyond the possibilities offered by other fuels (except the special case of molten salt reactors). These features make HTRs potentially interesting for closing the nuclear fuel cycle and stabilizing the plutonium inventory. A large number of fuel cycle studies are already available today on three main categories of fuel cycles involving HTRs: (a) high-enriched uranium cycle, based on thorium utilization as a fertile material and high-enriched uranium as a fissile material; (b) low-enriched uranium cycle (LEU), where only LEU is used (from 5 to 15%); (c) plutonium cycle based on the utilization of plutonium only as a fissile material, with (or without) fertile materials. Plutonium consumption at high burnups in HTRs has already been tested with encouraging results under the DRAGON project and at Peach Bottom. To maximize plutonium consumption, recent core studies have also been performed on plutonium HTR cores, with special emphasis on weapon-grade plutonium consumption. We complete the picture by a core study for an HTR burning reactor-grade plutonium. Limits in burnup due to core neutronics are investigated for this type of core. With these limits in mind, we study in some detail the Pu cycle in the special case of a reactor fleet made of a mixture of LWRs and HTRs. It is reasonable to assume that if HTRs are to be deployed on an industrial scale, they will coexist during a long period of time with already existing LWRs.

J	Smith, BM; Anghaie, S				Smith, BM; Anghaie, S			Gas core reactor with magnetohydrodynamic power system and cascading power cycle	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Advanced Nuclear Power Plants (ICAPP)	JUN 09-13, 2002	Hollywood, FL			gas core reactor; magnetohydrodynamic power generator; nuclear power plants	HIGH-TEMPERATURES; DYNAMICS	The U.S. Department of Energy initiative Generation IV aim is to produce an entire nuclear energy production system with next-generation features for certification before 2030. A Generation IV-capable system must have superior sustainability, safety and reliability, and economic cost advantages in comparison with third generation light water reactors (LWRs). A gas core reactor (GCR) with magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) power converter and cascading power cycle forms the basis for a Generation IV concept that is expected to set the upper performance limits in sustainability and power conversion efficiency among all existing and proposed fission powered systems. A gaseous core reactor delivering thousands of megawatt fission power acts as the heat source for a high-temperature MHD power converter. A uranium tetrafluoride fuel mix, with similar to95% mol fraction helium gas, provides a stable working fluid for the primary MHD Brayton cycle. The hot working fluid exiting a topping cycle MHD generator has sufficient heat to drive a conventional helium Brayton cycle with 35% thermal efficiency as well as a superheated steam Rankine cycle, with up to 40% efficiency, which recovers the waste heat from the intermediate Brayton cycle. A combined cycle efficiency of close to 70% can be achieved with only a modest MHD topping cycle efficiency. The high-temperature direct-energy conversion capability of an MHD dynamo combined with an already sophisticated steam-powered turbine industry knowledge base allows the cascading cycle design to achieve breakthrough first-law energy efficiencies previously unheard of in the nuclear power industry. Although simple in concept, the gas core reactor design has not achieved the state of technological maturity that established high-temperature gas-cooled reactors and high-temperature molten salt core reactors have pioneered. However, the GCR-MHD concept has considerable promise; for example, like molten salt reactors the fuel is continuously cycled, allowing high burnup, continuous burning of actinides, and hence greatly improved fuel utilization. The fuel inventory is two orders of magnitude lower than LWRs of comparable power output, and fissile plutonium production is likewise lower than in spent LWR fuel. Besides these features, specific GCR-MHD design challenges such as fission enhanced gas conductivity of the MHD partially ionized gas, GCR safety issues and related engineering problems are discussed.

J	Ostroumov, PN				Ostroumov, PN			Heavy-ion beam dynamics in the RIA accelerators	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Charged Particle Optics (CPO)	OCT, 2002	Washington, DC			beam dynamics; superconducting linac; heavy ion; computer simulations		The Nuclear Science Community in the United States has unanimously concluded that developments in both nuclear science and its supporting technologies make building a Rare-Isotope Accelerator (RIA) facility for production of radioactive beams. The RIA development effort involves several US Laboratories (ANL, JLAB, LANL, LBNL, MSU, ORNL). The RIA project includes a continuous wave 1.4 GV driver linac and a 123 MV post-accelerator, both based on superconducting (SC) cavities operating at frequencies from 48 to 805 MHz. Several new conceptual solutions in physics design of heavy-ion SC linacs have been developed recently. In particular, the concept of multiple charge state beam acceleration in SC linacs was tested and will be used in the driver linac to increase available accelerated beam power. A detailed design has been developed for the focusing-accelerating lattice of the RIA linacs which are configured as an array of short SC cavities, each with independently controllable RF phase. Independent phasing allows the velocity profile to be varied: the linac can be tuned to provide higher energies for the lighter ions. For example, the reference design linac can be tuned to provide a uranium beam at an energy of 403 MeV/u and can be re-tuned to provide a proton beam at 900 MeV. The linac must provide 100 kW beam power with the possibility to upgrade up to 400 kW. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Nishikawa, M; Kinjyo, T; Nishida, Y				Nishikawa, M; Kinjyo, T; Nishida, Y			Chemical form of tritium released from solid breeder materials	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							ISOTOPE-EXCHANGE REACTION; HYDROGEN ADDITION; PURGE GAS; INVENTORY; BLANKET; LI2ZRO3; SURFACE; SYSTEM; WATER; BED	The fraction of HTO in total tritium was measured at release of the bred tritium to the purge gas with hydrogen using the thermal release after irradiation method, where neutron irradiation was performed at the Japan Research Reactor-3 (JRR-3) in Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI) or the Kyoto University Research Reactor (KUR reactor) in Kyoto University. It is experimentally confirmed in this study that not a small portion of bred tritium is released to the blanket purge gas in the form of HTO from ceramic breeder materials even when hydrogen is added to the purge gas. Observation in this study implies that it is necessary to have a bred tritium recovery system useful for both HT and HTO form tritium. The water formation properties from Li2TiO3 bed placed in the hydrogen atmosphere were also discussed in this study. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Rest, J				Rest, J			A model for fission-gas-bubble behavior in amorphous uranium silicide compounds	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							GRAIN SUBDIVISION; HEAVY-IONS; IRRADIATION; GLASSES; GROWTH; FUELS; U3SI2; FLOW; UO2	A model for the behavior of fission gas in irradiated amorphous materials is developed. The model proposes that gas bubble nucleation occurs within shear bands initiated around free volume regions. Small gas-atom clusters that form within these regions are susceptible to dissolution by forces generated by the plastic flow of material around the cluster. The bubble coarsening process depends on the materials viscosity and on irradiation-induced re-solution. The bubble distribution eventually reaches a point where larger bubbles from the tail of the evolving lognormal size distribution begin to contact the more numerous nanometer-sized bubbles from the peak region. This condition defines the knee in the swelling curve. The fission density at which the knee occurs is a function of fission rate. Calculations for the behavior of the knee, swelling, and the fraction of gas in bubbles in irradiated U3Si2 intermetallic compounds are compared to measured quantities. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

J	Finlay, MR; Hofman, GL; Snelgrove, JL				Finlay, MR; Hofman, GL; Snelgrove, JL			Irradiation behaviour of uranium silicide compounds	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							DISPERSION FUEL-ELEMENTS; U3SI2	A study of the irradiation behaviour of uranium silicide and other related inter-metallic uranium compounds is presented. This study was motivated by the recent discovery that U3Si2 undergoes a crystalline to amorphous transformation during irradiation. Such information renders a previously developed fuel swelling model based on the crystalline state of U3Si2 invalid. This is of particular significance since low enriched U3Si2 dispersion fuels are widely used in research reactors. While such a finding does not alter the well established, stable and benign behaviour of U3Si2 during irradiation, it does indicate that a different interpretation of that behaviour is required.

The (U,Gd)O-2 fuel pellets were oxidized at 475 degreesC, subsequently heat treated at 1300 degreesC, and then cooled to room temperature in air. The accompanying weight variations were measured using thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). The measured weight variations were mathematically analyzed with reference to the successive phase reactions during the heat treatment.

Large grains are obtained by addition of dopants like Nb2O5, TiO2, Cr2O3, V2O5 etc. However, presence of such dopants might affect the thermophysical and thermomechanical properties of the fuel. In the present investigation the effect of TiO2 addition on the hot hardness (H) of sintered UO2 fuel has been studied from ambient to 1573 K in vacuum. TiO2 content was varied from 0.01 to 0.15 w/o resulting in a grain size (G) variation of 9 to 94 mum. With increase in grain size (or TiO2 content) H first decreases, attains a minima and then increases further. The increase is more prominent at lower temperature (<773 K) than that at higher temperatures. H vs. G(-1/2) plots indicates the same type of variation like other oxide ceramics with H minima at an intermediate grain size at low temperature. The intrinsic hardness and softening coefficient of UO2 indicate cubic dependence on TiO2 content. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A specific experimental study has been conducted, the first part being devoted to thermal diffusion and applied on implanted samples. The analysis procedure used is based on the spreading (under thermal annealing conditions) of a helium-3 profile initially created in the material. The profile is investigated by the resonant nuclear reaction, He-3(d,p)He-4. The measured helium-3 diffusion coefficients obtained indicate two types of behavior between 1123 and 1273 K, depending on the fluence, with a common activation energy of 2 eV. The values determined experimentally demonstrate that the thermal component of helium diffusion in spent fuel will not be significant,over the time/temperature range of interim storage and disposal. Vacancy defects can lead to changes in the behavior and in the diffusion of helium. They will be quantified in the second part of this study. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The study indicated that by carefully controlling the feed composition and the heat treatment scheme, soft mixed oxide microspheres could be obtained which are amenable for pelletisation at relatively low compaction pressures (200-250 MPa). The green pellets could be sintered in air up to 97% of TD at 1350 degreesC. The fractured and polished surface of the pellets showed a smooth surface without any berry structure. The shrinkage behaviour of these pellets was also studied in Ar + 8% H-2 atmosphere using a dilatometer. These studies revealed that the densification starts at a low temperature of 1100 degreesC. The SEM studies indicated uniform microstructure in the pellets with 3-5 mum grain size with uniform pores (similar to1 mum) distributed homogeneously in the pellet. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

It was found that (D) over tilde is a decreasing function of the departure from stoichiometry, while the oxygen diffusion coefficient reported in literature is an increasing function in the same range of departure from stoichiometry. For x < 0.07, this behavior was attributed to the presence of the singly ionized (2:2:2)' Willis defects evidenced by electrical conductivity measurements. The enthalpy of formation of these clusters amounts to DeltaH(f) = -1.7 +/- 0.6 eV. For x greater than or equal to 0.07, the decreasing function of (D) over tilde with x can be explained either by Willis defects alpha time ionized or more complex defect aggregates or via a dynamic exchange between mobile small defects and larger clusters or domains.

The quasisteady-state temperature distribution in the cylindrical UO2 pellet under microwave heating was measured. If the heating rate was as high as 20-30 K/min, local sintering occurred and a large crack was formed around the circumference of the sintered pellet. An optimum condition to have intact crack-free pellets was to heat at a rate 7 K/min up to 1550 degreesC and then 3 K/min to final sintering temperature. The effect of sintering temperature and time on the density and grain size Of UO2 pellets was investigated for the microwave sintering process where the heating rate was properly controlled. The results were compared with those obtained by conventional sintering method. The microwave processing produced an enhancement in both densification and grain growth. The UO2 pellet without any cracks having more than 95% theoretical density and 5 mum grain size was obtained by the present microwave sintering in H-2 at 1600 degreesC for 1 h. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

J	Smith, DL; Naberejnev, DG				Smith, DL; Naberejnev, DG			Confidence intervals for the lognormal probability distribution	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						analysis; errors; uncertainty; probability; variables; symmetric confidence intervals		The present communication addresses the topic of symmetric confidence intervals for the lognormal probability distribution. This distribution is frequently utilized to characterize inherently positive, continuous random variables that are selected to represent many physical quantities in applied nuclear science and technology. The basic formalism is outlined herein and a conjured numerical example is provided for illustration. It is demonstrated that when the uncertainty reflected in a lognormal probability distribution is large, the use of a confidence interval provides much more useful information about the variable used to represent a particular physical quantity than can be had by adhering to the notion that the mean value and standard deviation of the distribution ought to be interpreted as best value and corresponding error, respectively. Furthermore, it is shown that if the uncertainty is very large a disturbing anomaly can arise when one insists on interpreting the mean value and standard deviation as the best value and corresponding error, respectively. Reliance on using the mode and median as alternative parameters to represent the best available knowledge of a variable with large uncertainties is also shown to entail limitations. Finally, a realistic physical example involving the decay of radioactivity over a time period that spans many half-lives is presented and analyzed to further illustrate the concepts discussed in this communication.

J	Notari, C				Notari, C			A PHWR with slightly enriched uranium. About the first core	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								Many different studies have been performed in Argentina regarding the use of slightly enriched uranium in PHWR nuclear plants. These referred mainly to operating plants so that a transition had to be considered from the current natural uranium fuel cycle to the slightly enriched one. The first argentine NPP, Atucha 1, commissioned in 1974 and designed to operate with natural uranium was converted to slightly enriched uranium in a process that was initiated in 1995 and culminated in 2001. In this analysis, where new PHWR plants are considered, technical and economical arguments are presented which favor the use of a natural uranium initial core. The levelized fuel costs are shown to be practically insensitive to the first core and a fast transition between the two cycles is more influential than an initial enriched core.

J	Woods, MJ				Woods, MJ			MRA calibration and measurement capabilities - radioactivity	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th International Conference on Radionuclide Metrology and Its Applications	JUN 02-06, 2003	Dublin, IRELAND			MRA; Mutual Recognition Arrangement; CMCs; MRA Appendix C; radioactivity; metrology		The practical realisation of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement relies on its two main Appendices, B and C. Appendix B relates to the equivalence of national measurement standards. The dissemination of these standards is achieved by the provision of physical standards and measurement services, where the associated measurement values are traceable to the SI. Appendix C specifies the quantities and ranges for which participating institutes recognise the validity of calibration and measurement certificates issued by other participating institutes and these are detailed in the database devoted to these standards and services, commonly referred to as calibration and measurement capabilities. Each participating institute has the opportunity to submit entries, via its Regional Metrology Organisation (RMO), to the database but, in order for users to be able to make informed choices, it is important that the data are entered to a common standard. The Joint Committee of the RMOs and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures is responsible for the coordination of data provided by the RMOs. It is for individual RMOs to ensure the correctness of their own entries and to review and comment on those from others. This paper details that process and describes the various entries in the tables. It also addresses some of the remaining issues that still need to be resolved, in particular, the magnitudes of uncertainties and the need for supporting comparisons, both of which still present some significant problems.

An IAEA publication in 1991 was dedicated to the evaluation of half-lives and specific gamma-ray emission probabilities for 39 selected radionuclides considered to be important for detector efficiency calibrations. A new exercise was initiated in December 1998 to update this previous evaluation and to include a number of new radionuclides of interest; 62 radionuclides were considered along with specific parent-daughter combinations (to give a total of 64 radionuclides). That work is now being completed and a new set of recommended data is being prepared for publication. A critical comparison of the 1991 and 2003 half-life data suggests that there has not been any significant improvement in the accuracy of the recommended data. The possible reasons for this situation are discussed together with the evaluation procedure and the quality of the available data. Proposals are made for concerted actions that could lead to a significant improvement in these recommended half-life data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The most accurate measurements by Jaffey et al. (Phys. Rev. C 4 (5) 1889) with 1sigma uncertainties of 0.054% (U-238) and 0.068% (U-235), are not confirmed by other measurements of comparable accuracy. In this work, we take a critical look at the 231 U and 215 U half-life measurements in the literature. Although we find that the Jaffey et al. data are concordant with other reliable results, generally much higher uncertainties of the latter cannot prove or disprove the Jaffey et al. results.

Some long-lived radionuclides have been measured for up to 28 years: Kr-85, Sr-90, Ag-108(m), Ba-133, Eu-152, Eu-154, and more recently Zn-65, Ru-106, Cd-109 and Cs-137; short-lived radionuclides have also been studied such as: F-18, Ga-67, Rb-81, Mo-99, Tc-99(m), Pd-103, In-111, I-123, I-131, Sm-153, Er-169, Lu-177, Re-186, Re-188, Tl-201, Rn-222 and Ra-224. Relative uncertainties of half-life values of the order of 5 x 10(-4) were obtained. These values are compared to the results of other measurements and evaluations, and the limiting systematic effects are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mendeleyev Institute for Metrology) and LNHB (Laboratoire National Henri Becquerel), special Ra-226 sources were prepared by VNIIM in order to determine as accurately as possible the absolute photon emission probabilities for the main X- and gamma-rays following the decay of Ra-226 and daughters. The main purpose of this work was to supplement a previous joint study by Laboratorio Nacional de Metrologia das Radiacoes Ionizantes (LNMRI) and LNHB to determine their relative values. Some specific point sources were produced for alpha-spectrometry measurements that were undertaken at VNIIM and also for gamma-ray spectrometry studies at VNIIM and LNHB. The Ra-226 activity for the gamma-spectrometric sources was measured relative to the alpha-spectrometric sources by comparing the counts of the main gamma-rays. The total uncertainty of the activity for these sources was 0.2% (k = 1). Using calibrated germanium detectors, several X- and gamma-ray spectra were analyzed to determine the absolute photon emission probabilities of Ra-226 in radioactive equilibrium with daughters. The results are presented and compared to other published values. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The beta-detector was inserted into the well of the gamma-detector. Since counting efficiencies in both the beta- and gamma-channels can be kept high, excellent counting statistics were attainable even when weak sources were measured. This configuration can also be used for radioactivity measurements based upon the direct integral counting of 4pibeta + 4pigamma logic sum signals, and two independent results can be obtained for every measurement. This technique is especially useful for the standardization of complex decaying nuclides. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
