The specific type of large LOCA is DECL (Double Ended Cold Leg) break which means a total guillotine type of break in cold leg pipe and is one of the most dangerous accidents in the reactor containment. In this paper, thermal hydraulic parameters (temperature and pressure) of WWER-1000 (Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant) containment in a DECL accident have been simulated by CONTAIN 2.0 code and a single cell model. The containment has been divided to 23 cells in CONTAIN code but for simplicity only one cell has been considered in modeling. The model has been programmed by MATLAB. The accident has been simulated for a short time (initial 200 s) and all of the results have been compared with Bushehr's Nuclear Power Plant FSAR. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An immersed body method for coupled neutron transport and thermal hydraulic simulations of PWR assemblies	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Immersed body method; Coupled neutron fluid solid modelling; Pressurised water reactor simulation	FISSILE SOLUTIONS; COBRA-TF; CRITICALITY; REACTOR; FLOW; VALIDATION; EXPANSION; KINETICS; UO2	A recently developed immersed body method is adapted and used to model a typical pressurised water reactor (PWR) fuel assembly. The approach is implemented with the numerical framework of the finite element, transient criticality code, FETCH which is composed of the neutron transport code, EVENT, and the CFD code, FLUIDITY. Within this framework the neutron transport equation, Navier-Stokes equations and a fluid energy conservation equation are solved in a coupled manner on a coincident structured or unstructured mesh. The immersed body method has been used to model the solid fuel pins. The key feature of this method is that the fluid/neutronic domain and the solid domain are represented by overlapping and non-conforming meshes. The main difficulty of this approach, for which a solution is proposed in this work, is the conservative mapping of the energy and momentum exchange between the fluid/neutronic mesh and the solid fuel pin mesh. Three numerical examples are presented which include a validation of the fuel pin submodel against an analytical solution; an uncoupled (no neutron transport solution) PWR fuel assembly model with a specified power distribution which was validated against the COBRA-EN subchannel analysis code; and finally a coupled model of a PWR fuel assembly with reflective neutron boundary conditions. Coupling between the fluid and neutron transport solutions is through the nuclear cross sections dependence on Doppler fuel temperature, coolant density and temperature, which was taken into account by using pre-calculated cross-section lookup tables generated using WIMS9a. The method was found to show good agreement with both the analytical and COBRA-EN solutions. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Jewer, S.; Buchan, A.

To analyze the atmospheric dispersion of radioactive materials, the AERMOD-PRIME model, CFD model and meteorological data from 2010 were used. The terrain and building effects on the atmospheric dispersion of radioactive materials within a 1 km radius of the site were statistically significant. The maximum concentration of the radioactive material increased by 7 times compared to the concentration when the terrain and building effects were not considered. It was found that the terrain and building influenced the decrease in the concentration of radioactive material in a concentric circle with a 914 m radius from the center of the site. The concentration of radioactive material in a concentric circle with a 350 m radius was two-times higher than the concentration estimated at the backside of the building, which is the downwind side, without any consideration of the terrain and building effects. In consideration of the Korean situation, in which multiple nuclear reactors are built on the same nuclear site, it is necessary to evaluate the risk that may affect workers and nearby residents by reflecting the terrain and building effects.

Finite difference analysis of the transient temperature profile within GHARR-1 fuel element	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Transient heat conduction; Shutdown heat generation; Finite difference method; Fuel element; Cladding	CORE	Mathematical model of the transient heat distribution within Ghana Research Reactor-1 (GHARR-1) fuel element and related shutdown heat generation rates have been developed. The shutdown heats considered were residual fission and fission product decay heat. A finite difference scheme for the discretization by implicit method was used. Solution algorithms were developed and MATLAB program implemented to determine the temperature distributions within the fuel element after shutdown due to reactivity insertion accident. The simulations showed a steady state temperature of about 341.3 K which deviated from that reported in the GHARR-1 safety analysis report by 2% error margin. The average temperature obtained under transient condition was found to be approximately 444 K which was lower than the melting point of 913 K for the aluminium cladding. Thus, the GHARR-1 fuel element was stable and there would be no release of radioactivity in the coolant during accident conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Atmospheric dispersion modeling and radiological safety analysis for a hypothetical accident of Ghana Research Reactor-1 (GHARR-1)	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Atmospheric dispersion modeling; Source term; MCNPX; HotSpot		Atmospheric dispersion modeling and radiological safety analysis were performed for a postulated accident scenario of the generic Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU) Ghana Research Reactor-1 (GHARR-1) core. The source term was generated from an inventory of peak radioisotope activities released by using the isotope generation code MCNPX. The health physics code, HotSpot, was used to perform the atmospheric transport modeling which was then applied to calculate the total effective dose and how it would be distributed to human organs as a function of distance downwind. All accident scenarios were selected from the GHARR-1 Safety Analysis Report (SAR), assuming that the activities were released to the atmosphere after a design basis accident. The adopted methodology was the use of predominant site-specific meteorological data and dispersion modeling theories to analyze the incident of a hypothetical release to the environment of some selected radionuclides from the site and evaluate to what extent such a release may have radiological effects on the public. The results indicate that all the values of Effective dose obtained, with the maximum of 2.62 x 10(-2) mSv at 110 m from the reactor, were far below the regulatory limits, making the use of the reactor safe, even in the event of severe accident scenario.

Performance of a total absorption clover detector for Q(beta) measurements of neutron-rich nuclei far from the beta-stability line	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Clover Ge detector; Total absorption detector; Q(beta) measurements; U-238 (p, f); On-line mass separator	BGO DETECTOR; DECAY; Q(BETA)-MEASUREMENTS; SPECTROMETER; SIMULATION; SPECTRA; VALUES	To measure beta-decay energies (Q(beta)s) of neutron rich nuclei far from the beta-stability line, we have improved upon the previously described total absorption detector, composed of a clover Ge detector (80 mm(phi) x 90 mm(L) x 4 crystals) and 4 pi BGO Compton suppressors. This detector can directly determine the Q(beta) from the end point of the measured spectrum. Nuclei of interest such as new isotopes have Q(beta) values over 4 MeV; therefore, high detection efficiencies are needed. This total absorption detector has a through hole (alongside its vertical axis) at the center of the four Ge crystals, and the radioactive sources can be placed in this hole to measure the total absorption spectrum. The beta- and gamma-rays are absorbed by the detector with almost 4 pi geometry while escaping radiations from the Ge detector can be detected by the 4 pi BGO Compton suppressors. We also developed a practical analytic procedure based on the folding method, in which response functions of gamma- and beta-rays were considered with an assumed decay scheme. The systematic uncertainty of the deduced Q(beta)s; was evaluated to be +/- 30 keV using 18 fission products whose Q(beta) values were precisely measured. With the detector and an on-line mass separator, we have determined the Q(beta) values of Eu-166 and Gd-165 for the first Lime, and have proposed more precise Q(beta) values for Eu160-165 and Gd-163 than previously found. Owing to the especially good energy resolution of the detector, the isomeric state in Gd-163 was also successfully observed for the first time through end-point analysis and analysis of the observed gamma-rays. This result contributes to the determination of reliable Q(beta) values for Gd-163 and Eu-163. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier EN.

Design and construction of a water target system for harvesting radioisotopes at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Radioisotope harvesting; NSCL; FRIB	NON-HODGKINS-LYMPHOMA; SILICA PRODUCTION; CU-67-2IT-BAT-LYM-1; RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY; SEPARATOR	A liquid water target system for harvesting radioisotopes at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) was designed and constructed as the initial step in proof-of-principle experiments to harvest useful radioisotopes from the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). FRIB will be a new national user facility for nuclear science, to be completed in 2020, at which radioisotopes will be collected synergistically from the water in cooling-loops for the primary beam dump that cycle the water at flow rates in excess of hundreds of gallons per minute. As part of the development of radiochemical expertise required to harvest long-lived radioisotopes of interest in this environment, the water target system described here was constructed and successfully used to collect a test beam of relativistic Na-24 ions produced at the NSCL. Future studies will involve collecting interesting transition metal isotopes such as Cu-67 from less purified secondary projectile fragment beams. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Currently, for monitoring the airborne contamination of nuclear fuel, only energy information measured by Si semiconductor detectors is used to distinguish nuclear fuel material from radon daughters. In some cases, however, such distinguishing is difficult when the radon concentration is high. In addition, a Si semiconductor detector is generally sensitive to noise. In this study, we developed a new alpha particle imaging system by combining a Si PM array, which is insensitive to noise, with a Ce-doped Gd3Al2Ga3O12(GAGG) scintillator, and evaluated our developed system's fundamental performance. The scintillator was 0.1-mm thick, and the light guide was 3.0 mm thick. An Am-241 source was used for all the measurements. We evaluated the spatial resolution by taking an image of a resolution chart. A 1.6 lp/mm slit was clearly resolved, and the spatial resolution was estimated to be less than 0.6-mm FWHM. The energy resolution was 13% FWHM. A slight distortion was observed in the image, and the uniformity near its center was within +/- 24%. We conclude that our developed alpha-particle imaging system is promising for plutonium detection at nuclear fuel facilities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Competing effects of electronic and nuclear energy loss on microstructural evolution in ionic-covalent materials	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Ceria; Silicon carbide; Ion irradiation	MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; SILICON-CARBIDE; DEFECT PRODUCTION; FUSION ENERGY; IRRADIATION; CEO2; DAMAGE; AMORPHIZATION; TEMPERATURE; RECOVERY	Ever increasing energy needs have raised the demands for advanced fuels and cladding materials that withstand the extreme radiation environments with improved accident tolerance over a long period of time. Ceria (CeO2) is a well known ionic conductor that is isostructural with urania and plutonia-based nuclear fuels. In the context of nuclear fuels, immobilization and transmutation of actinides, CeO2 is a model system for radiation effect studies. Covalent silicon carbide (SIC) is a candidate for use as structural material in fusion, cladding material for fission reactors, and an inert matrix for the transmutation of plutonium and other radioactive actinides. Understanding microstructural change of these ionic-covalent materials to irradiation is important for advanced nuclear energy systems. While displacements from nuclear energy loss may be the primary contribution to damage accumulation in a crystalline matrix and a driving force for the grain boundary evolution in nanostructured materials, local non-equilibrium disorder and excitation through electronic energy loss may, however, produce additional damage or anneal pre-existing defects. At intermediate transit energies where electronic and nuclear energy losses are both significant, synergistic, additive or competitive processes may evolve that affect the dynamic response of materials to irradiation. The response of crystalline and nanostructured CeO2 and SiC to ion irradiation are studied under different nuclear and electronic stopping powers to describe some general material response in this transit energy regime. Although fast radiation-induced grain growth in CeO2 is evident with no phase transformation, different fluence and dose dependence on the growth rate is observed under Si and Au irradiations. While grain shrinkage and amorphization are observed in the nano-engineered 3C SiC with a high-density of stacking faults embedded in nanosize columnar grains, significantly enhanced radiation resistance is attributed to stacking faults that promote efficient point defect annihilation. Moreover, competing effects of electronic and nuclear energy loss on the damage accumulation and annihilation are observed in crystalline 4H-SiC. Systematic experiments and simulation effort are needed to understand the competitive or synergistic effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Zhang, Y.; Weber, W.

Annealing of the defects observed by Raman spectroscopy in UO2 irradiated by 25 MeV He2+ ions	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Raman spectroscopy; Uranium dioxide; Irradiation	URANIUM-DIOXIDE; LATTICE-DEFECTS; CRYSTALS	Understanding the effect of irradiation in UO2 is a major issue for nuclear industry and for the design of irradiation resistant materials. We have previously evidenced irradiation induced defects in UO2 that can be characterized by Raman spectroscopy. Here we present the Raman characterization of these defects as a function of temperature. UO2 samples were irradiated with 25 MeV He2+ ions at room temperature and then heated at different temperature without irradiation. Some samples were also irradiated at high temperature. Heat treatment after irradiation evidenced one annealing temperature on Raman spectra. This annealing temperature is shifted to higher values when the samples are simultaneously heat treated and irradiated. It is compared to the annealing temperatures that are reported in literature on irradiated UO2. This indicates that Raman observed defects would be point defects on uranium sublattice. This attribution is consistent with the one we previously proposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A thermal modelling of displacement cascades in uranium dioxide	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Irradiation; Cascade; Thermal spike; Molecular dynamics; Uranium dioxide	MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; UO2; POTENTIALS; RADIATION; EVOLUTION; METALS	The space and time dependent temperature distribution was studied in uranium dioxide during displacement cascades simulated by classical molecular dynamics (MD). The energy for each simulated radiation event ranged between 0.2 keV and 20 keV in cells at initial temperatures of 700 K or 1400 K. Spheres into which atomic velocities were rescaled (thermal spikes) have also been simulated by MD to simulate the thermal excitation induced by displacement cascades. Equipartition of energy was shown to occur in displacement cascades, half of the kinetic energy of the primary knock-on atom being converted after a few tenths of picoseconds into potential energy. The kinetic and potential parts of the system energy are however subjected to little variations during dedicated thermal spike simulations. This is probably due to the velocity rescaling process, which impacts a large number of atoms in this case and would drive the system away from a dynamical equilibrium. This result makes questionable MD simulations of thermal spikes carried out up to now (early 2014). The thermal history of cascades was compared to the heat equation solution of a punctual thermal excitation in UO2. The maximum volume brought to a temperature above the melting temperature during the simulated cascade events is well reproduced by this simple model. This volume eventually constitutes a relevant estimate of the volume affected by a displacement cascade in UO2. This definition of the cascade volume could also make sense in other materials, like iron. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Helium behaviour in UO2 through low fluence ion implantation studies	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Helium; Uranium dioxide; Thermal desorption spectroscopy	URANIUM-DIOXIDE; DIFFUSION; NRA	In this work we focus on experiments involving implantation of 500 keV(3)He ions in sintered polycrystal-line material. Samples are implanted at low fluences (similar to 2 x 10(13) ions/cm(2)) and subsequently isothermally annealed in a highly sensitive thermal desorption spectrometry (TDS) device PIAGARA (Plateforme Inter-disciplinaire pour l'Analyse des GAz Rares en Aquitaine). The helium fluencies studied are two to three orders of magnitude lower than previous Nuclear Reaction Analysis (NRA) experiments carried out on identical samples implanted at identical energies. The fractional release of helium obtained in the TDS experiments is interpreted using a three-dimensional axisymmetric diffusion model which enables results to be quantitatively compared to previous NRA data. The analysis shows that helium behaviour is qualitatively independent of ion fluency over three orders of magnitude: helium diffusion appears to be strongly inhibited below 1273 K within the centre of the grains presumably as a result of helium bubble precipitation. The scenario involving diffusion at grain boundaries and in regions adjacent to them observed at higher fluencies is quantitatively confirmed at much lower doses. The main difference lies in the average width of the region in which uninhibited diffusion occurs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Experimental and numerical investigations of radiation characteristics of Russian portable/compact pulsed neutron generators: ING-031 ING-07, ING-06 and ING-10-20-120	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Portable neutron generators; Compact neutron generators; Pulsed neutron; Neutron shielding	SCATTERING	The present paper discusses results of full-scale experimental and numerical investigations of influence of construction materials of portable pulsed neutron generators ING-031, ING-07, ING-06 and ING-10-20-120 (VNIIA, Russia) to their radiation characteristics formed during and after an operation (shutdown period). In particular, it is shown that an original monoenergetic isotropic angular distribution of neutrons emitted by TiT target changes into the significantly anisotropic angular distribution with a broad energy spectrum stretching to the thermal region. Along with the low energetic neutron part, a significant amount of photons appears during the operation of generators. In the pulse mode of operation of neutron generator, a presence of the construction materials leads to the "tailing" of the original neutron pulse and the appearance of an accompanying photon pulse at similar to 3 ns after the instant neutron pulse. In addition to that, reactions of neutron capture and inelastic scattering lead to the creation of radioactive nuclides, such as Co-58, Cu-62, Cu-64 and F-18, which form the so-called activation radiation. Thus, the selection of a portable neutron generator for a particular type of application has to be clone considering radiation characteristics of the generator itself. This paper will be of interest to users of neutron generators, providing them with valuable information about limitations of a specific generator and with recommendations for improving the design and performance of the generator as a whole.

Several ancillary detection systems integral to the device's capabilities for charged-particle tagging and light-ion identification following a variety of nuclear reaction mechanisms have been constructed and characterized. In particular, a silicon PIN diode wall, an annular silicon segmented detector, and a CsI(T1) scintillator wall have together enabled particle-gamma correlations for reaction channel selectivity and precision kinematic reconstruction in recent measurements. We highlight the construction, characteristics, and implementation of the device's ancillary detectors as they enable a rich set of electromagnetic transition rate measurements via Doppler-shift lifetime techniques and low-energy Coulomb excitation.

The isotopic ratios of Cs-134/Cs-137 and Cs-135/Cs-137 were analyzed by thermal ionization mass spectrometry with a single filament method using a TaO activator. Samples containing 5 Bq of Cs-137 were analyzed with typical analytical errors of approximately 0.5% for Cs-134/Cs-137 and approximately 0.1% for Cs-135/Cs-137. Measurements of both ratios showed profiles that were characteristic of the measurements of among other environmental samples reported in the literature.

Part 4: turbulent flows and plume dispersion in an actual urban area	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						local-scale high-resolution atmospheric dispersion model; nuclear emergency response system; large-eddy simulation; spatially developing turbulent boundary layer flow; plume dispersion; complex urban structure; model performance evaluation	ARRAYS; BOUNDARY; FIELD	We have developed a local-scale high-resolution atmospheric dispersion model using large-eddy simulation (LOHDIM-LES) to assess the safety at nuclear facilities and to respond to emergency situations resulting from accidental or deliberate releases of radioactive materials (e.g., a terrorist attack in an urban area). In Part 1, the unsteady behavior of a plume dispersing over a flat terrain was successfully simulated. In Parts 2 and 3, LESs of turbulent flows and plume dispersion around an isolated building and in building arrays with different obstacle densities were performed, which showed the basic performance comparable to wind tunnel experimental technique. In this study, we apply the LES model to turbulent flows and plume dispersion in an actual urban area. Although some of the turbulence and dispersion characteristics are quantitatively different from the wind tunnel experimental data, the distribution patterns are generally similar to those of the experiments. It is concluded that our LES model simulates reasonably the unsteady behavior of turbulent flows and plume dispersion even for complex heterogeneous urban areas.

The system is actually designed for simultaneous measurement of gaseous elements like He, Xe, Kr, thermally released from nuclear fuel samples and also allows the determination of the release kinetics as a function of time. This system, called Quantitative GAs MEasurement System (Q-GAMES), is based on the principle of collecting, purifying and spiking the sample gas in a high-pressure chamber, and continuous sampling of the gas for mass spectrometric analysis without sample depletion during the experiment. It is equipped with its own spike generator and with different gas purification systems. It is shown that this system fulfills the requirement to work with two existing very high-temperature gas desorption facilities for nuclear materials. This paper describes the Q-GAMES principle, the spiking system, its calibration, its operative mode, the different quantification techniques, as well as its technical data, in combination with some examples of typical application.

The results demonstrated that the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident in early March 2011 resulted in high Xe-133 activity concentrations as well as elevated levels of Kr-85 activity; there was a striking increase in the concentrations of both isotopes over the week running from 14 to 22 March as the radioactive plume released from the plant was captured. At Chiba, following the accident, the Kr-85 activity concentration increased from 1.38 to 17.7 Bq/m(3), while the Xe-133 levels increased from below the minimum detectable concentration (MDC 1.9 x 10(-3) Bq/m(3)) to 1.3 x 10(3) Bq/m(3). Conversely, at Sapporo and Akita, high Kr-85 activity concentrations were not observed, due to differences in air transportation mechanisms based on wind directions. Duplicate samples were collected at Chiba to allow the simultaneous analyses of Kr-85 and Xe-133 at the Japan Chemical Analysis Center and the Bundesamt fur Strahlenschutz in Germany and the results were in good agreement. The external effective radiation doses resulting from Kr-85 and Xe-133 releases following the accident were estimated to be approximately 7.0 x 10(-3) and 1.3Sv, respectively, based on the activity concentrations of these nuclides from March to June in 2011 at Chiba.

Political instability in Ukraine that led to Russia's annexation of the Crimean peninsula has changed more than the political geography of the region. In March 2013, European Union and Russian leaders signed a 'roadmap' for energy cooperation until 2050. Russia has long been the largest oil, gas, uranium and coal exporter to the EU and the EU has been by far Russia's largest trading partner.

The uneven profile will usually result in higher cladding temperature which cannot meet the design limit for SCWR. In order to optimize bundle design, the analysis of coupled neutronics/ thermal-hydraulics was carried out. The neutronics code WIMS-AECL and the subchannel code ATHAS are selected to conduct the coupled neutronics/thermal-hydraulics analysis for the PT-SCWR 54-elements bundle design. The optimization was carried out through (1) adopting staggered radial uranium enrichment profile and (2) optimizing the pitch-circle radiuses of element rings. The results showed that the obtained optimized bundle can meet the demand of limiting criteria for peak cladding temperature and negative coolant temperature coefficient. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluation of containment venting strategy via VFS path for advanced passive PWR NPP	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Advanced passive PWR; Venting path; Containment depressurization; VFS; Filtered venting		Containment would be suffered by over-pressurization if passive containment cooling system (PCS) is failed to remove the heat for the advanced passive pressurized water reactor (PWR). Containment depressurization should be evaluated. Severe accident sequence induced by large break loss of coolant accident (LB-LOCA) at belt of vessel is selected to evaluate the effectiveness of containment venting strategy for advanced passive PWR with the integral safety analyses code, focusing on containment behaviors. Different sizes of the venting path and different open/close pressures of venting are investigated to evaluate CsI mass fraction released to the environment through Containment Air Filtration System (VFS). The results show that depressurization strategy by using the path of VFS can mitigate the high pressure risks and prevent the containment failure when PCS can't be initiated. High pressure at start of venting would reduce the operation times for operator to open the VFS path, reduce the radioactive released to the environment and delay the release time. The Containment Filtered Venting System (CFVS) used in generation II PWR can maintain the containment pressure below the design pressure and reduce the radioactive release for the advanced passive PWR. However much more steam is generated by In-Vessel Retention (IVR) measure, the venting capability is not enough to make the pressure at low value and the venting path should be enlarged.

J	Kamalpour, S; Khalafi, H; Mirvakili, SM				Kamalpour, Sarah; Khalafi, Hossein; Mirvakili, Seyed Mohammad			Conceptual design study of light water subcritical assembly	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Neutronic design; Subcritical reactor; MCNPX code; Core physics parameters	DELAYED NEUTRON FRACTION; RESEARCH REACTOR; SENSITIVITY	Due to high level of inherent safety, subcritical assemblies are widely used for research and training purposes. This paper presents the neutronic design of a typical research subcritical assembly with domestic fuel rods. This assembly consists of fuel sub-assemblies with 4 x 4 square arrays of fuel pins. Two types of fuel pins, metal uranium with Al cladding and uranium dioxide with Zr-Nb 1% cladding, are studied. It is cooled and moderated using ordinary water and is surrounded by Beryllium as reflector. According to sub-criticality of the assembly, a 5-curie Am-Be source was located in the center of the assembly to sustain chain reactions. The simulations were implemented by MCNPX code and neutronic parameters were calculated accordingly. Optimal fuel rod pitch and fuel rod radius were investigated and effect of different reflectors on the effective multiplication factor (k(eff)) were studied. Then thermal, epithermal, fast and total average flux were calculated. Considering the importance of subcritical assembly feedbacks, moderator and fuel temperature coefficients of reactivity were obtained. Since the effective delayed neutron fraction and neutron generation time play an important role in the reactor kinetics, they were also calculated for this subcritical assembly. Results of the simulation show that by arranging the fuel sub-assemblies in a 9 x 9 array, multiplication factor of about 0.8 for metal U and about 0.7 for UO2 is achieved for subcritical assembly. The optimum thickness of Beryllium reflectors was found to be 26 cm for metal U and 31 cm for UO2. Results also show that the subcritical assembly with metal U fuel has higher average total flux but the subcritical assembly with UO2 fuel has larger reactivity coefficient. However, the results also prove that the subcritical assembly with both fuels is inherently safe due to negative fuel and moderator temperature coefficients of reactivity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The environmental impact assessment process for nuclear facilities: A review of the Lithuanian practice and experience	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Review						Lithuania; Nuclear facilities; Environmental impact assessment; Regulatory review	RADIOACTIVE-WASTE MANAGEMENT; POWER-PLANT; PROGRESS	The only one nuclear power plant (NPP) in the Republic of Lithuania - Ignalina NPP has been shutdown and entered the phase of decommissioning. Decommissioning activities, along with dismantling works, include construction and operation of a new spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste management, storage and disposal facilities. The new NPP in Lithuania, if such would be constructed, are to be located adjacently to the existing plant. Current and future planned nuclear activities in Lithuania are concentrated in a single location, in the northeast of the country near the state borders with the Republic of Latvia and the Republic of Belarus. Number of different projects and participants involved, necessity to control and limit overall impact on the environment require for planning and coordination of activities and impacts, including consideration and updating of outcomes from the previous environmental impact assessment (EIA) studies. Regulatory review and coordination of EIA documents also demands substantial time resources, impacts schedule of activities and therefore must be properly planned and managed. The paper describes approach and progress in EIA for nuclear activities in Lithuania and examines experience gained in preparation, review and coordination of EIA studies. Emphasis is placed on approach that has been used to deal with cumulative radiological impact because acceptability of this impact is one of primary goal in demonstration of acceptability of the newly planned nuclear activities.

J	Sahin, S; Sarer, B; Celik, Y				Sahin, Sumer; Sarer, Basar; Celik, Yurdunaz			Neutronic investigations of a laser fusion driven lithium cooled thorium breeder	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Inertial confinement fusion; Thorium; TRISO particles; Natural lithium coolant; Tritium breeding	BED NUCLEAR-REACTOR; PRELIMINARY DESIGN; HYBRID BLANKET; FUEL	The paper investigates the main parameters of a Laser Inertial Confinement Fusion Fission Energy (LIFE) driven thorium breeder. A similar blanket to the (LIFE) engine design in Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is chosen in order to allow mutual feedback between two geographically separated teams towards a more advanced and improved design under consideration of totally independent views. In the basic design, frozen (D,T) fusion fuel ice is shot to the center of 5 m diameter spherical fusion reactor chamber cavity in pulsed mode (10-30 Hz). Fusion fuel burns through direct or indirect laser beam irradiation. The first wall surrounds the fusion chamber and is made of S-304 steel (2 cm). The fusion reactor cavity is kept in high vacuum. It is followed by a natural lithium coolant zone. A 2nd S-304 layer (2 cm) separates the lithium zone on the right side from the graphite reflector (30 cm). The outer boundary of the graphite reflector is also covered with a 3rd S-304 layer (2 cm). The calculations have been performed for a fusion driver power of 500 MWth with the last available version of MCNP, namely with MCNPX-2.7.0. In the first calculation phase, the thickness of the natural lithium coolant-tritium breeder zone (MU has been varied as 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 cm to select the coolant thickness Delta R-Li; to have a satisfactory tritium breeding ratio (TBR) for continuous fusion reactor operation. For a pure fusion blanket without any fissionable elements in the coolant, TBR values are calculated as 1.237, 1.312, 1.370, 1.415, 1.449 and 1.476, respectively, for corresponding coolant thicknesses. A Delta R-Li value of 50 cm would keep TBR > 1.05 for self-sustaining tritium supply. These Delta R-Li values lead to blanket energy multiplication values of M = 1.209, 1.216, 1.219, 1.222, 1.223 and 1.224, respectively, and have been calculated, as a result of exoenergetic neutron absorption in Li-6. For coolant thickness values >50 cm, the increase of "M" would remain minor. In the second phase, ThO2 has been suspended in the form of micro-size tristructural-isotropic (TRISO) particles in the lithium coolant for U-233 breeding. TRISO fuel has the great advantage of high mechanical stability. Furthermore, fission products will be separated from the coolant. TRISO particles have been dispersed homogenously in the lithium coolant with volume fractions V-tr = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10 vol-%. Calculations with Delta R-Li = 50 cm and by variable V-tr result with TBR = 1.229, 1.222, 1.214, 1.206, 1.1997 and 1.1622, respectively. Parasitic neutron absorption in Thorium decreases the TBR values. For V-tr < 5 vol-% TRISO in the coolant, the increase of the neutron absorption in thorium will be compensated to a great degree through neutron multiplications via Th-232(n,f) and Th-232(n,2n) reactions so that the sacrifice on TBR remains acceptable. However, for V-tr 5 TRISO vol-%, neutron absorption in thorium reduces TBR drastically. On the other hand, the blanket energy multiplication M increases with thorium volume fraction, namely as M = 1.2206, 1.2322, 1.2426, 1.2536, 1.2636, 1.3112 for respective TRISO volume fractions due to the contribution of fission energy. Fissile fuel productions in the blanket are calculated as 17.23, 33.09, 48.66, 64.21, 79.77 and 159.71 U-233 (kg/year), respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Objectives of the project included reconstruction of the accident progressions using computer models and accident data, and validation of MELCOR and the Fukushima models against plant data. In this study Sandia National Laboratories developed MELCOR 2.1 models of Fukushima Daiichi Units 1 (1F1), 2, and 3 as well as the Unit 4 spent fuel pool. This paper reports on the analysis of the 1F1 accident. Details are presented on the modeled accident progression, hypothesized mode of failures in the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) and containment pressure boundary, and release of fission products to the environment. The MELCOR-predicted RPV and containment pressure trends compare well with available measured pressures. Conditions leading up to the observed explosion of the reactor building are postulated based on this analysis where drywell head flange leakage is thought to have led to accumulation of flammable gases in the refueling bay. The favorable comparison of the results from the analyses with the data from the plant provides additional confidence in MELCOR to reliably predict real-world accident progression. The modeling effort has also provided insights into future data needs for both model development and validation.

Objectives of the project included reconstruction of the accident progressions using computer models and accident data, and validation of the MELCOR code and the Fukushima models against plant data. A MELCOR 2.1 model of the Fukushima Daiichi Unit 3 reactor is developed using plant-specific information and accident-specific boundary conditions, which involve considerable uncertainty due to the inherent nature of severe accidents. Publicly available thermal-hydraulic data and radioactivity release estimates have evolved significantly since the accidents. Such data are expected to continually change as the reactors are decommissioned and more measurements are performed. The MELCOR simulations in this work primarily use boundary conditions that are based on available plant data as of May 2012.

This melt-water interaction, called fuel-coolant interaction (FCI), may damage the structures and threaten the reactor integrity if there is a steam explosion. FCI occurs generally in two phases: a premixing phase, during which the molten corium jet is fragmented into large droplets and mixed with the water, and the explosion phase, during which the vapor film that has developed around the fuel droplets is destabilized and the droplets are finely fragmented. The presented work covers a set of experimental studies describing the morphology and nature of the solidified materials after interaction with water. Debris from experiments performed in the KROTOS (Commissariat a l' Energie Atomique, Cadarache, France); PREMIX, ECO (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany); and MISTEE (Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden) facilities have been characterized by metallographic, analytical, and microscopic techniques. These post-test analyses are able to provide important information on the solidification path and other main phenomena involved during FCI It was found that the behavior of metallic and oxide melts differs significantly from the standpoint of debris morphology. Oxide melts that underwent simple coarse fragmentation showed spherical or angular rocklike shape, unlike metallic melts. A statistical analysis was performed on the debris from the KROTOS tests; a data set of particles was described by the circularity, solidity, and porosity. The mechanism of water ingression (Kim and Corradini) inside the melt droplet was observed to be the key mechanism of fine (secondary) fragmentation. The particles participating in fine "thermal" fragmentation have significantly higher porosity, up to similar to 30% for prototypic corium in the KROTOS facility. It was calculated that only a part of the premixed melt participates in fine fragmentation, i.e., about one-third of the melt mass for the KROTOS tests using UO2-ZrO2 mixture.

Progression of the accident has been analyzed with the SAMPSON code. SAMPSON was originally designed as a large-scale simulation system with the maximum use of mechanistic models and theoretically based equations. In the progression analysis done for Unit 2, SAMPSON could reproduce the pressure transient of the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) reasonably well by assuming partial load operation of the reactor core isolation cooling system (RCIC). The pressure transient of the primary containment vessel was reproduced reasonably well by assuming torus room flooding. After the RCIC trip and manual opening of the steam relief valve, SAMPSON predicted the damage to the upper part of the fuel assemblies near the core center and RPV failure due to creep rupture. More than 91 wt% of the core debris relocated to the lower plenum was as particles, and the major constituents were UO2, Zr, and ZrO2 by SAMPSON analysis.

There was no release of radioactive material to the environment despite damage to several pieces of equipment, such as the toppling of a heavy oil tank, short-circuiting of non safety-related high-voltage metal-clad switchgear, and internal flooding of the reactor auxiliary building. While we conducted the plant control, people who lived in the neighborhood of the NPS, whose residences had been damaged by the tsunami, came to the plant seeking shelter and help with evacuation. We accommodated then? in the on-site gymnasium and provided necessities such as food and blankets. Within several days, the number of evacuees increased and surpassed 360, and we lived with them for nearly 3 months. The key points for safe cold shutdown were first, the plant site grade was higher than the maximum tsunami height and, second, an emergency diesel generator for each unit and one of the off-site electrical power lines remained available. In addition to these factors, preparedness (such as seismic reinforcements for all units, updating of tsunami predictions where appropriate, and regular fire drills and simulator training for loss of off-site-power) contributed greatly. However, we must still achieve higher standards of safety. First, we must conduct a detailed evaluation of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami and take necessary actions based on this evaluation. Second, we have to take proper countermeasures against severe accidents. We have learned many lessons from the Fukushima Daiichi accident, and we will continue to make efforts in order to avoid a similar severe accident again.

Thus, international consensus has been reached that inherent tolerance of nuclear fuel to severe accidents needs to be increased significantly to prevent accidents or to mitigate their consequences. In this respect, several countries have started to develop accident-tolerant fuel (ATF) that can tolerate loss of active cooling for a considerably longer time period than current fuels, while maintaining or improving performance during normal operations and operational transients and also enhancing fuel safety for beyond-design-basis events. The Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute is also developing ATF : surface-coated Zr cladding and metal-ceramic hybrid cladding for the purpose of suppressing hydrogen generation during severe accidents, and microcell UO2 pellets to enhance the retention of highly radioactive and corrosive fission products such as Cs and I, where all UO2 grains are enveloped by thin cell walls that act as chemical traps or physical barriers for the movement of fission products. When the screening of developing fuel materials has been peiformed through various out-of-pile tests, irradiation tests of the selected materials will be carried out in a research reactor to demonstrate their enhanced accident tolerance.

A diffusion model of the implanted H, D, T, and He species in a 1-mm-thick first wall of tungsten for the two initial phases of the proposed European laser fusion project HiPER (namely, phases 4a and 4b) has been implemented using the tritium migration analysis program TMAP7. The effects of the abrupt temperature increases, working temperatures, and the operational pulsing modes on the diffusion are studied. Although a detailed treatment of the different trapping mechanisms has been omitted, meaningful quantitative results on the accumulation, desorption, and time intervals to reach a stationary state are presented and discussed.

J	Tits, J; Gaona, X; Laube, A; Wieland, E				Tits, Jan; Gaona, Xavier; Laube, Andreas; Wieland, Erich			Influence of the redox state on the neptunium sorption under alkaline conditions: Batch sorption studies on titanium dioxide and calcium silicate hydrates	RADIOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Neptunium; Redox; Sorption; Cement; C-S-H phases; TiO2	RUTILE-WATER INTERFACE; DEGRADED CEMENT PASTES; SURFACE COMPLEXATION; IONIC-STRENGTH; CONTACT TIME; URANYL IONS; TH SORPTION; SOLUBILITY; ADSORPTION; SPECIATION	Wet chemistry experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of the redox state and aqueous speciation on the uptake of neptunium by titanium dioxide (TiO2) and by calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H) under alkaline conditions. TiO2 was chosen as a reference sorbent to determine the surface complexation behaviour of neptunium under alkaline conditions. C-S-H phases are important constituents of cement and concrete. They may contribute significantly to radionuclide retention due to their high recrystallization ratesmaking incorporation the dominating sorption mechanism for many radionuclides (e.g. the actinides) on these materials. The sorption of neptunium on both solids was found to depend strongly on the degree of hydrolysis. On TiO2 R-d values for Np(IV), Np(V) and Np(VI) are identical at pH = 10 and decrease with progressing hydrolysis in case of Np(V) and Np(VI). On C-S-H phases,R-d values for the three redox states are also identical at pH = 10. While the R-d values for Np(VI) sorption on C-S-H phases decrease with progressing hydrolysis, the R-d values for Np(IV) and Np(V) sorption are not affected by the pH. In addition to the effect of hydrolysis, the presence of Ca is found to promote Np(V) and Np(VI) sorption on TiO2 whereas on C-S-H phases, the present wet chemistry data do not give unambiguous evidence. Thus, the aqueous speciation appears to have a similar influence on the sorption of the actinides on both types of solids despite the different sorption mechanism. The similar R-d values for Np(IV, V, VI) sorption at pH = 10 can be explained qualitatively by invoking inter-ligand electrostatic repulsion between OH groups in the coordination sphere of Np(V) and Np(VI). This mechanism was proposed earlier in the literature for the prediction of actinide complexation constants with inorganic ligands. A limiting coordination number for each Np redox state, resulting from the inter-ligand electrostatic repulsion, allows the weaker sorption of the highest hydrolysed Np(V,VI) species to be explained.

J	Brockmann, S; Arnold, T; Bernhard, G				Brockmann, Sina; Arnold, Thuro; Bernhard, Gert			Speciation of bioaccumulated uranium(VI) by Euglena mutabilis cells obtained by laser fluorescence spectroscopy	RADIOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Euglenamutabilis; Uranium; Bioaccumulation; Laser; induced fluorescence spectroscopy (LIFS); AMD; Speciation	ACID-MINE DRAINAGE; ALGAE CHLORELLA-VULGARIS; HEAVY-METALS; ADENINE-NUCLEOTIDES; COMPLEX-FORMATION; URANYL IONS; WASTE PILE; U(VI); ENVIRONMENTS; COMMUNITIES	The ability of Euglena mutabilis cells -a unicellular protozoan with a flexible pellicle, which is typically found in acid mine drainage (AMD) environments -to bioaccumulate uranium under acid conditions was studied in batch sorption experiments at pH 3 and 4 using Na2SO4 and NaClO4 as background media. It was found that axenic cultures of Euglena mutabilis Schmitz were able to bioaccumulate in 5 days 94.9 to 99.2% of uranium from a 1 x 10(-5) mol/L uranium solution in perchlorate medium and 95.1 to 95.9% in sodium sulfate medium, respectively. The speciation of uranium in solution and uranium bioaccumulated by Euglena mutabilis cells, were studied by laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy (LIFS). The LIFS investigations showed that the uranium speciation in the NaClO4 systems was dominated by free uranyl(VI) species and that the UO2SO4 species was dominating in the Na2SO4 medium. Fluorescence spectra of the bioaccumulated uranium revealed that aqueous uranium binds to carboxylic and/or (organo) phosphate groups located on the euglenid pellicle or inside the Euglena mutabilis cells. Reduced uranium immobilization rates of 0.93-1.43 mg uranium per g Euglena mutabilis biomass were observed in similar experiments, using sterile filtrated AMD waters containing, 4.4 x 10(-5) mol/L uranium. These lower rates were attributed to competition with other cations for available sorption sites. Additional LIFS measurements, however, showed that the speciation of the bioaccumulated uranium by the Euglena mutabilis cells was found to be identical with the uranium speciation found in the bioaccumulation experiments carried out in Na2SO4 and NaClO4 media. The results indicate that Euglena mutabilis has the potential to immobilize aqueous uranium under acid condition and thus may be used in future as promising agent for immobilizing uranium in low pH waste water environments.

Radiolabeled particulates of appropriate size, wherein the radionuclide is irreversibly attached to the preformed particles, offer distinct advantages as the radiopharmaceuticals for use in RSV over other radiotherapeutic agents in terms of minimal leakage of radioactivity from the joint cavity. Hyroxyapatite (HA) particles, regarded as one of the most suitable carrier moiety for radiosynoviortheses applications, have been envisaged for labeling with Er-169 with an aim to developing an agent for RSV of digital joints. Erbium-169 was produced with a specific activity of 415 +/- 23 MBq/mg and radionuclidic purity of 99.22 +/- 0.17% ( both at the end of bombardment) by thermal neutron irradiation of enriched (98.2% in Er-168) erbium target at a flux of similar to 8 x 10(13) n/cm(2)s for 21 d. HA particles (1-10 mu m size), synthesized in-house, were labeled with Er-169 in high yield and radiochemical purity (> 99%) using 5mg of HA particulates at pH 7.5. The radiolabeled particulates showed excellent in vitro stability in normal saline and human serum. Biodistribution and imaging studies (using Er-171-HA) carried out in normal Wistar rats following intra-articular injection of Er-169-HA particulates in the knee joint showed near-complete retention of injected radioactivity within the synovial cavity with almost no activity leaching out to the other organs/ tissue.

Methodology and Results of Investigation of Radiation Creep in Large-Grain Uranium Dioxide Based Fuel	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article							IRRADIATION; UO2	Three series of investigations of the radiation creep of modified uranium dioxide with grain size a parts per thousand yen25 mu m were conducted, using methods and experimental means developed in this work, for reactor conditions at fission density 1.2 center dot 10(13) sec(-1) center dot cm(-3). Diagrams of radiation creep in the stress interval 10-40 MPa were obtained for three temperatures. At 747 A degrees C, the results are identical to the radiation creep of standard uranium dioxide. At this temperature, the deformation is controlled by radiation creep, which is confirmed by the linear dependence on the stress. The creep rates at 927 and 1028 A degrees C are higher than for standard uranium dioxide. The stress dependence of the creep rate can be represented by a power-law function or a combination of linear and power-law functions.	[Mikheev, E. N.; Fedotov, A. V.; Novikov, V.

The key question for HTR is therefore: how far are HTRs competitive against gas technologies? This simple question demands a complex response. First, the cogeneration scheme has to be discussed according the specificities in heat usage of every industry as they will impact the design. Second, the costs, revenues and risks of the different lifecycle phases for both a HTR and gas cogeneration plant have to be assessed and compared. These parameters will greatly depend on each location (personnel costs, gas local prices, CO2 pricing, etc.). A particular attention has to be given to the risk interactions between the cogeneration plant and the industrial facility it is supplying with heat and electricity (e.g. tritium contamination in industrial processes, explosion of flammable products in industrial site). This paper aims mainly at starting exchanges at international level with other equivalent initiatives in order to assess in general terms the economic viability of HTR worldwide, in relation to the evaluation of the HTR global market.

While TRISO coated particles have been proven as a very efficient barrier for a large range of fission products in HTR experimental reactors, some particular fission products could still diffuse at a considerable rate. Most importantly, radioactive silver Ag-110m was found to be released from coated particles. In future HTRs with active components like a gas turbine in the primary circuit, such silver contamination may severely limit maintainability of these parts with the result of reduced life-time performance. So far, experimental analyses on silver diffusion through silicon carbide have led to contradictory results. In this work, an alternative method was used to generate silicon carbide layers as a basis for analysis of silver diffusion. With pulsed laser deposition (PLD), it is possible to generate coatings of different materials and various kinds of compounds. In particular, this technology allows the generation of layers very well defined with respect to their composition, purity and density. The microstructure can precisely be manipulated through various parameters. Based on different silicon carbide coatings with well-defined properties, we are going to investigate the silver diffusion process. Our goal is to derive the properties of an ideal silicon carbide coating preventing silver diffusion entirely. In this paper we present the major aspects of our work creating crystalline SiC layers as well as silver and Csl layers both on plane and spherical substrates. Analyses with X-ray diffraction, X-ray spectrometry and secondary ion mass spectrometry show that complex multilayer systems comprising a graphite substrate, a crystalline SiC layer and an intermediate silver layer were successfully created. Major challenges to approach in the future are the handling of high-level intrinsic stresses forming in the layer structure as well as the high vapour pressure of silver and Csl, complicating subsequent crystalline SiC coating.

These results are also compared to those of the standard 9.6 wt% enriched 9 g/fuel sphere U/Pu fuel cycle. The weapons-grade and reactor-grade plutonium fuel cycles produced good burn-ups. However, the addition of the Minor Actinides to the reactor-grade plutonium caused a large decrease in the burn-up and thus an unacceptable increase in the heavy metal (HM) content in the spent fuel, which was intended for direct disposal in a deep geological repository, without chemical reprocessing. All the plutonium fuel cycles failed the adopted safety limits used in the PBMR400 in that either the maximum fuel temperature of 1130 degrees C during normal operation, or the maximum power density of 4.5 kW/sphere was exceeded. All the plutonium fuel cycles also produced positive uniform temperature reactivity coefficients, i.e. the reactivity coefficient where the temperatures of the fuel and the graphite moderator in the fuel spheres were varied together. These unacceptable positive coefficients were experienced at low temperatures, typically below 700 degrees C. This was due to the influence of the thermal fission cross-section resonances of Pu-239 and Pu-241. Weapons-grade plutonium produced the worst safety performance. The safety performance of the reactor-grade plutonium also deteriorated when the HM loading was reduced from 3 g/sphere to 2 g or 1 g. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thorium-based fuel cycles: Reassessment of fuel economics and proliferation risk	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Topical Meeting on High Temperature Reactor Technology (HTR 2012)	OCT 28-NOV 01, 2012	Japan Atom Energy Agcy, Tokyo, JAPAN	Soc Chem Engineers, Japan Soc Mech Engineers, Div Energy Engn, Atom Energy Soc Japan, Power & Energy Syst Div, Japan Atom Energy Commiss, Computat Sci & Engn Div, Minist Educ, Culture, Sports, Sci & Technol, Minist Econ, Trade & Ind	Japan Atom Energy Agcy			At current consumption and current prices, the proven reserves for natural uranium will last only about 100 years. However, the more abundant thorium, burned in breeder reactors, such as large High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactors, and followed by chemical reprocessing of the spent fuel, could stretch the 100 years for uranium supply to 15,000 years. Thorium-based fuel cycles are also viewed as more proliferation resistant compared to uranium. However, several barriers to entry caused all countries, except India and Russia, to abandon their short term plans for thorium reactor projects, in favour of uranium/plutonium fuel cycles. In this article, based on the theory of resonance integrals and original analysis of fast fission cross sections, the breeding potential of Th-232 is compared to that of U-238. From a review of the literature, the fuel economy of thorium-based fuel cycles is compared to that of natural uranium-based cycles. This is combined with a technical assessment of the proliferation resistance of thorium-based fuel cycles, based on a review of the literature. Natural uranium is currently so cheap that it contributes only about 10% of the cost of nuclear electricity. Chemical reprocessing is also very expensive. Therefore conservation of natural uranium by means of the introduction of thorium into the fuel is not yet cost effective and will only break even once the price of natural uranium were to increase from the current level of about $70/pound yellow cake to above about $200/pound. However, since fuel costs constitutes only a small fraction of the total cost of nuclear electricity, employing reprocessing in a thorium cycle, for the sake of its strategic benefits, may still be a financially viable option. The most important source of the proliferation resistance of Th-232/U-233 fuel cycles is denaturisation of the U-233 in the spent fuel by U-232, for which the highly radioactive decay chain potentially poses a large radiation as well as a detection risk to would-be proliferators. However, countries with proliferation ambitions could give the U-mixture to terrorist groups directly after chemical separation, before significant build-up of the radioactive decay chain, which would significantly reduce the proliferation resistance of the mixture. A roadmap for overcoming some of these barriers to market entry is suggested. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this third irradiation test, designated as AGR-3/4, is to measure fission product release and transport by irradiating compacts containing a small fraction of fuel particles that are intentionally designed to fail (DTF) early in the irradiation test. Transport of fission products released by the mixed uranium carbide/uranium oxide kernels within the DTF particles will be studied in the compact's carbon matrix and in cylindrical rings surrounding the compacts, which were made from either compact matrix material or structural graphite. Results will be used to refine fission product transport models. Coating of the 20-mu m-thick pyrocarbon-coated DTF and standard TRISO driver-fuel particles, fabrication of the fuel compacts containing these particles, and characterization of the key fuel properties are discussed in this paper.

First elevated-temperature performance testing of coated particle fuel compacts from the AGR-1 irradiation experiment	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Topical Meeting on High Temperature Reactor Technology (HTR 2012)	OCT 28-NOV 01, 2012	Japan Atom Energy Agcy, Tokyo, JAPAN	Soc Chem Engineers, Japan Soc Mech Engineers, Div Energy Engn, Atom Energy Soc Japan, Power & Energy Syst Div, Japan Atom Energy Commiss, Computat Sci & Engn Div, Minist Educ, Culture, Sports, Sci & Technol, Minist Econ, Trade & Ind	Japan Atom Energy Agcy			In the AGR-1 irradiation experiment, 72 coated-particle fuel compacts were taken to a peak burnup of 19.5% fissions per initial metal atom with no in-pile failures. This paper discusses the first post-irradiation test of these mixed uranium oxide/uranium carbide fuel compacts at elevated temperature to examine the fuel performance under a simulated depressurized conduction cooldown event. A compact was heated for 400 h at 1600 degrees C. Release of Kr-85 was monitored throughout the furnace test as an indicator of coating failure, while other fission product releases from the compact were periodically measured by capturing them on exchangeable, water-cooled deposition cups. No coating failure was detected during the furnace test, and this result was verified by subsequent electrolytic deconsolidation and acid leaching of the compact, which showed that all SiC layers were still intact. However, the deposition cups recovered significant quantities of silver, europium, and strontium. Based on comparison of calculated compact inventories at the end of irradiation versus analysis of these fission products released to the deposition cups and furnace internals, the minimum estimated fractional losses from the compact during the furnace test were 1.9 x 10(-2) for silver, 1.4 x 10(-3) for europium, and 1.1 x 10(-5) for strontium. Other post-irradiation examination of AGR-1 compacts indicates that similar fractions of europium and silver may have already been released by the intact coated particles during irradiation, and it is therefore likely that the detected fission products released from the compact in this 1600 degrees C furnace test were from residual fission products in the matrix. Gamma analysis of coated particles deconsolidated from the compact after the heating test revealed that silver content within each particle varied considerably; a result that is probably not related to the furnace test, because it has also been observed in other as-irradiated AGR-1 compacts. X-ray imaging of selected particles was performed to examine the internal microstructure. This examination revealed variable irradiation performance of the coating layers, but sufficient statistical sampling is not yet available to identify any possible correlation to variation in individual particle fission product retention.

These irradiations and fuel development are being accomplished to support development of the next generation reactors in the United States, and will be irradiated over the next several years to demonstrate and qualify new TRISO coated particle fuel for use in high temperature gas reactors. The goals of the irradiation experiments are to provide irradiation performance data to support fuel process development, to qualify fuel for normal operating conditions, to support development and validation of fuel performance and fission product transport models and codes, and to provide irradiated fuel and materials for post irradiation examination (PIE) and safety testing. The experiments, which will each consist of at least six separate capsules, will be irradiated in an inert sweep gas atmosphere with individual on-line temperature monitoring and control of each capsule. The sweep gas will also have on-line fission product monitoring on its effluent to track performance of the fuel in each individual capsule during irradiation. The first experiment (designated AGR-1) started irradiation in December 2006 and was completed in November 2009. The second experiment (AGR-2) started irradiation in June 2010 and is currently scheduled to be completed in April 2013. The third and fourth experiments have been combined into a single experiment designated AGR-3/4, which started its irradiation in December 2011 and is currently scheduled to be completed in November 2013. Since the purpose of this experiment is to provide data on fission product migration and retention in the NGNP reactor, the design of this experiment is significantly different from the first two experiments, though the control and monitoring systems are very similar. The purpose and design of this experiment will be discussed followed by its progress and status to date. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Grover, S.

The sol gel process for preparation of UO2 kernels have been improved and optimized at Institute of Nuclear and New Energy Technology (INET), Tsinghua University, PR China, and a whole set of facility was designed and constructed based on the process. This report briefly describes the main steps of the process, the key equipment and the production capacities of every step. Six batches of kernels for scale-up verification and four batches of kernels for fuel elements for in-pile irradiation tests have been successfully produced, respectively. The quality of the produced kernels meets the design requirements. The production capacity of the process reaches 3-6 kgU per batch. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Unqualified coated particles and spherical fuel elements unavoidablely occur during the processing of coating UO2 kernels and embedding the coated particles into the graphite matrix. So it is necessary to reprocess the UO2 in the unqualified coated particles and spherical fuel elements to maximize the use of the reactor core materials. In this work, we present several methods to: (1) separate the coated particles from the graphite matrix and, (2) expose and recover the UO2 kernels from the coated particles. The comparison of different methods shows that the thermal oxidation of graphite by a fixed bed burner and the jet grinding of the unqualified coated particles are prosing in practice for the separation of coated particles from the graphite matrix and recovering the uranium dioxide kernels, respectively. Some other methods, such as etching the SiC layer with the active fluorine species in plasma generated by the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) under the atmosphere also show their great potential values in the reprocessing of reactor core materials, especially for the activated and contaminated fuels.

Early HTR development employed thorium together with high-enriched uranium. After 1980, most HTR fuel systems switched to low-enriched uranium. After completing fuel development for AVR and THTR with BISO coated particles, the German program expanded efforts on a new program utilizing thorium and high-enriched uranium TRISO coated particles for advanced HTR concepts for process heat applications (PNP) and direct-cycle electricity production (HHT). The combination of LTI inner and outer pyrocarbon layers surrounding a strong, stable SiC layer greatly improved manufacturing conditions and the subsequent contamination and defective particle fractions in production fuel elements. In addition, this combination provided improved mechanical strength and a higher degree of solid fission product retention, not known previously with HTI-BISO coatings. The improved performance of the HEU (Th,U)O-2 TRISO fuel system was successfully demonstrated in three primary areas of development: manufacturing, irradiation testing under normal operating conditions, and accident simulation testing. In terms of demonstrating performance for advanced HTR applications, the experimental failure statistic from manufacture and irradiation testing are significantly below the coated particle requirements specified for PNP and HHT designs at the time. Covering a range to 1300 degrees C in normal operations and 1600 degrees C in accidents, with burnups up to 13% FIMA and fast fluences to 8 x 10(25) m(-2) (E> 16 fj), the results exceed the design limits on manufacturing and operational requirements for the German HTR Modul concept, which were: <6.5 x 10(-5) for manufacturing; <2 x 10(-4) for normal operating conditions; and <5 x 10(-4) for accident conditions. These performance statistics for the HEU (Th,U)O-2 TRISO fuel system are in good agreement with similar results for the LEU UO2 TRISO fuel system. 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For HTR, one of the key components is the ceramic fuel element. During the preparation of spherical fuel elements, the radioactive effluent treatment is necessary. Referring to the current treatment technologies and methods, the conceptual flowsheet of low-level radioactive effluent treatment during preparing spherical fuel elements was established. According to the above treatment process, the uranium concentration was decreased from 200 mg/l to the level of discharged standard. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These irradiations and fuel development are being accomplished to support development of the next generation reactors in the United States, and will be irradiated over the next several years to demonstrate and qualify new TRISO coated particle fuel for use in high temperature gas reactors. The goals of the irradiation experiments are to provide irradiation performance data to support fuel process development, to qualify fuel for normal operating conditions, to support development and validation of fuel performance and fission product transport models and codes, and to provide irradiated fuel and materials for post irradiation examination (PIE) and safety testing. The experiments, which will each consist of at least six separate capsules, will be irradiated in an inert sweep gas atmosphere with individual on-line temperature monitoring and control of each capsule. The sweep gas will also undergo on-line fission product monitoring to track performance of the fuel in each individual capsule during irradiation. The first experiment (designated AGR-1) started irradiation in December 2006 and was completed in November 2009. The second experiment (AGR-2), which utilized the same experiment design as well as control and monitoring systems as AGR-1, started irradiation in June 2010 and is currently scheduled to be completed in April 2013. The design of this experiment and support systems will be briefly discussed, followed by the progress and status of the experiment to date. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Grover, S.
