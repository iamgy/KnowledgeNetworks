Knowledge of these exit charge distributions is critical for interpreting g-factor measurements on exotic nuclei produced as radioactive beams. The data for both targets are in agreement with the empirical parameterization of the mean charge state proposed recently by Schiwietz and Grande. The distribution widths are in agreement with the formula of Baudinet-Robinet. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The isotopes of interest were produced by 93-120 MeV O-16, N-14 beams from Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre. Kolkata. Since direct interaction of primary heavy ion beams with the fullerene film was avoided in our experimental condition, the damage or degradation of the fullerene matrix could be reduced to insignificant level. The endohedral fullerenes formed were separated radio-chemically and the probabilities of formation of radioactive endohedral fullerenes from different isotopes were determined by gamma-spectrometry.

Resonance ionization of stable isotopes of Sri. Ge and Ni has been studied in a Ta hot cavity. Efficient three step resonant ionization schemes applying frequency tripling for the first excitation step and using auto-ionizing or atomic Rydberg states in the ionizing step have been identified for all three elements, resulting in laser ion beams of typically around 100 nA. By saturating most of the optical excitation steps involved, ionization efficiencies of 22%, 3.3% and 2.7% have been measured for Sri, Ge and Ni, respectively. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Favorite, JA				Favorite, JA			Variational estimates of internal interface perturbations and a new variational functional for inhomogeneous transport problems	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							EQUATIONS	Variational perturbation theory is applied to internal interface perturbations in neutral-particle inhomogeneous transport problems. The leakage from a radioactive system is the quantity of interest. The Schwinger and Roussopolos variational functionals are used with volume- and surface-integral formulations of the integrals of perturbed quantities. In numerical one-dimensional spherical tests of source radius perturbations, the Roussopolos functional in the surface-integral formulation worked better when the source was large, and the Schwinger functional in the volume-integral formulation worked better when the source was small. A new variational functional is presented that formally allows a combination of the Schwinger and Roussopolos functionals; the contribution of each to the total estimate is adjusted with a parameter introduced in one of the trial functions. When the parameter is correctly chosen, the new functional is generally more accurate than either the Schwinger or Roussopolos functional alone. An analytic monodirectional slab transport problem is also considered.

Sensitivity calculations were also performed for various physics design parameters such as the plutonium volume fraction of the fuel, fuel burnup, core material volume fraction, and the power density. The results showed that the initial breeding gain of -0.04755 is sufficient to sustain the recycling of the actinides with a reasonable amount of natural uranium and plutonium feed material. The comparative calculation on the core power density has shown that it is feasible to reduce the amount of minor actinides and spent fuel in the high power density core (98.4 MW/m(3)) compared to the reference core (58.2 MW/m(3)). It was also found that the fuel cycle cost is saved by 0.4 mills/kW.h for the high power density core compared to the reference core.

The interaction between heavy rare gases and low-energy electrons excited by the irradiation effect is very important for understanding the gas release mechanism and for developing the collecting method of radioactive fission product gases. Two types of plasma-testing apparatuses for the opened and closed low-energy plasmas were arranged using the radio frequency exciting source. The excitation behavior was evaluated by measuring the density and the temperature of the excited electrons. The electron density in the opened plasma increased with increase of the ionization energy of each rare gas. However, the electron density in the closed plasma of heavy rare gases (At, Kr and Xe) was enhanced nearly a thousand times higher than that of light rare gases (Ne and He). The difference was interpreted as based on the cross section for energy transfer to the low-energy electron formed by the multisputtering effect on wall surfaces in the closed plasma.

J	Choi, H; Park, CJ				Choi, H; Park, CJ			A physics study on thorium fuel recycling in a CANDU reactor using dry process technology	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						thorium recycle; dry process; CANDU reactor		Dry process fuel technology has high proliferation resistance, which is one of the important goals of the Generation-IV nuclear energy system developments. It is expected that dry process fuel technology can be applied not only to existing but also to future nuclear systems. In this study, the homogeneous ThO2-UO2 fuel cycle and the heterogeneous ThO2-DUPIC fuel cycle options of a Canada deuterium uranium (CANDU) reactor were assessed, which included a neutronic feasibility analysis of recycling spent fuels. Parametric calculations were also performed for reactivity coefficients and isotopic content changes for various initial fuel conditions. The results of the physics calculations have shown that it is feasible to recycle the thorium fuel through the dry process option in the CANDU reactor, which in turn significantly improves natural uranium savings and diminishes spent fuel. However,further investigation of the dry process option, which is technically and economically feasible for thorium-abundant dioxide fuel, is required.

J	Fridman, E; Shwageraus, E; Galperin, A; Todosow, M				Fridman, E; Shwageraus, E; Galperin, A; Todosow, M			Recycle of transuranium elements in light water reactors for reduction of geological storage requirements	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						transuranium element recycle; sustainable LWR cycle; thorium fuels		This paper presents results of a feasibility study aimed at developing a zero-transuranic-discharge fuel cycle based on the U-Th-TRU ternary cycle. The design objective is to find a fuel composition (mixture of thorium, enriched uranium, and recycled transuranic components) and fuel management strategy resulting in an equilibrium charge-discharge mass flow In such a fuel cycle scheme, the quantity and isotopic vector of the transuranium (TRU) component is identical at the charge and discharge time points, thus allowing the whole amount of the TRU at the end of the fuel irradiation period to be separated and reloaded into the following cycle. The TRU reprocessing activity losses are the only waste stream that will require permanent geological storage, virtually eliminating the long-term radiological waste of the commercial nuclear fuel cycle. A detailed three-dimensional full pressurized water reactor (PWR) core model was used to analyze the proposed fuel composition and management strategy. The results demonstrate the neutronic feasibility of the fuel cycle with zero-TRU discharge. The amount of TRU and enriched uranium loaded reach equilibrium after about four TRU recycles. The reactivity coefficients were found to be within a range typical for a reference PWR core. The soluble boron worth is reduced by a factor of similar to 2 from a typical PWR value. Nevertheless, the results indicate the feasibility of an 18-month fuel cycle design with an acceptable beginning-of-cycle soluble boron concentration even without application of burnable poisons.

The single-channel analysis provides the fuel. channelflow rate, pressure drop, critical channel power, and the channel exit quality, which are assessed against the thermal hydraulic design requirements of the CANDU-6 reactor. The single-channel analysis by the NUCIRC code showed that the thermal-hydraulic performance of the DUPIC fuel is not different from that of the standard CANDU fuel. Regarding the local flow characteristics, the subchannel analysis also showed that the uncertainty of the critical channel power calculation for the DUPIC fuel channel is very small. As a result, both the single and subchannel analyses showed that the key thermal hydraulic parameters of the DUPIC fuel channel do not deteriorate compared with the standard CANDU fuel channel.

J	Ronen, Y; Aboudy, M; Regev, D				Ronen, Y; Aboudy, M; Regev, D			Breeding of Am-242m in a fast reactor	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Am-242m production; MONJU reactor	NEUTRON-CAPTURE; NUCLEAR-FUEL; OPTIMIZATION; DESIGN; MONJU	There is growing interest in the use of (242m) Am as a nuclear fuel. Since the thermal absorption cross section of Am-242 is very high (sigma(a) = 8950 b), the best way to obtain Am-242 is by the capture of fast or epithermal neutrons in Am-241. As a result, we have considered replacing the radial blanket of a fast reactor, which is usually depleted uranium, with (AmO2)-Am-241. We chose a 714-MW(thermal) MONJU reactor, and we replaced some of the radial blanket and the outer core assemblies with 10 676 kg of (AmO2)-Am-241 fuel. We calculated the reactor core by, using the MCNP Monte Carlo code. The total amount of Am-242m becomes stabilized after 16 yr, but the enrichment does not. In our calculation, similar to 7.2% enrichment is obtained after 18 yr. Obtaining higher enrichments might indicate that Am-242m nuclear fuel can be used without further enrichment in many cases. The results presented in this paper are considered an upper limit scenario. In particular the target Am-241 loading is not likely to be available soon, but Am-242 production from lesser amounts is easily scaled down proportional to the actual mass irradiated.

J	Kalchgruber, R; Wagner, GA				Kalchgruber, R; Wagner, GA			Separate assessment of natural beta and gamma dose-rates with TL from alpha-Al2O3 : C single-crystal chips	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article						luminescence dating; Al2O3 : C; dose-rate	SEDIMENTS; DEPOSITS; AL2O3-C; GRAINS	A measurement procedure was developed for fast and separate assessment of beta and gamma dose-rates in natural sediments using highly sensitive alpha-Al2O3: C single-crystal chips. The dosemeters were buried for periods from two days to three weeks in sediments with different layer structure and homogeneity. For each measurement, a pair of dosemeters was buried, in order to assess beta and gamma dose-rates separately. One dosemeter was wrapped only in thin plastic foil to shield it from alpha radiation, thus measuring beta + gamma components. The second one, used for the gamma component only, was packed additionally in a 1 mm copper container for absorption of beta radiation. For calibration, another set of dosemeters was buried in reference soil with a well-known dose-rate and similar content of radioactive nuclides. By comparing the thermally stimulated luminescence signals from the dosemeters the gamma dose-rate and also, by subtraction, the beta dose-rate in the unknown soil could be determined. The calculated uncertainties were 5-7% and 10%, respectively. The resulting dose-rates for homogeneous and inhomogeneous media were compared with the results obtained by Ge- and on-site NaI-gamma-ray spectrometry. An agreement within 2 sigma-error limits was found for homogeneous media after only few days of exposure. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The workers inside these tombs exposed to natural radiations from natural Gamma emitters (external exposure) and inhale unknown radon doses (internal exposure) for long periods. The external exposure in all studied tombs is lower than the maximum recommended action level. The internal exposure in terms of annual effective dose in the south tomb is equal to 28.83 mSv/year which highly exceed the recommended level (3-10 mSv/year). In this tomb, the external exposure is equal to 21.43 mu Sv/year. This reflects the hazards of radon over the other natural radiations in the closed area. Among the workers inside the studied tombs, the expected morality is equal to 0.0033%, 0.0199% and 0.0724% for the south entrance of Zoser pyramid, the Serapeum tomb, and the south tomb respectively.

Furthermore, the method evaluates the solid angle subtended by the detectors at this part of the object and allows an optimised positioning of the detectors in order to achieve a maximum possible solid angle. Photon self-absorption within the object is demonstrated to be an important parameter which, depending on the photon energy, geometry and the material of the object, may affect the size of the volume of intersection and hence the solid angle.

Following the European Union suggestion, a reference level for radon concentration in the air at workplaces was established in several European countries. In Hungary, the relevant legislation has come into effect on 1 January 2003. The determination of average radon concentration might present a problem, especially in places where the monthly average concentrations vary to a great extent. For example, the monthly averages measured in a hospital cave used for treating respiratory diseases showed a 24-fold difference depending on the chosen month. In such cases, attention should be paid when choosing the months and using the results of measurements for dose assessment. Another uncertainty emerges when estimating the annual dose, based on the data coming from long-term measurements, usually using integrated methods such as track detectors. There is a considerable difference between the averages measured during the working hours and over the total time (including nights and weekends), mostly in the cases of rooms with frequent air change like schools, kindergartens and ventilated workplaces. This can lead to a significant overestimation in dose calculation. Special attention needs to be paid to workplaces such as mines, tunnels and open air uranium tailings sites. This paper discusses the possible inaccuracies caused by the improper selection of time periods and methods in the measurements of the average radon concentration at workplaces.

The fate of adsorption of radionuclide (e.g. U(VI)) on chelating cloth filter (CCF) from radioactive waste was investigated. The adsorption ability of the CCF increases as pH increases from 6 to 10. The predominant composition of the resulting complex was determined. A chemical adsorption mechanism was confirmed by examining the relationships between the adsorbed amount of radionuclide and the contact time. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The target used an Atomic Beam Source (ABS) to inject a flux of highly polarized atoms into a thin-walled, coated storage cell. The polarization of the electron beam was determined using a Compton laser backscattering polarimeter. The target polarization was determined using well-known nuclear reactions. The ABS and storage cell were embedded in the Bates Large Acceptance Toroidal Spectrometer (BLAST), which was used to detect scattered particles from the electron-target interactions. The target has been designed to rapidly (similar to 8h) switch operation from hydrogen to deuterium. Further, this target was the first to be operated inside a magnetic spectrometer in the presence of a magnetic field exceeding 2 kG. An ABS intensity 2.5 x 10(16) at/s and a high polarization (approximate to 70%) inside the storage cell have been achieved. The details of the target design and construction are described here and the performance over an 18 month period is reported. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lee, JY; Hwang, GS; Kim, M; No, HC				Lee, JY; Hwang, GS; Kim, M; No, HC			Experimental analysis of off-take phenomena at the header-feeder system of CANDU	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								An experimental study has been performed to investigate the off-take phenomena at the T-junction installed between the header and feeder pipes in CANadian Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) reactor. Previous works have been made to correlate the onset condition and the quality at the branch for the representative directions such as top, side and bottom. However, for the actual branches with specific direction such as +/- 36 degrees and +/- 72 degrees to the horizontal header in the header-feeder system of CANDU, the direct application of the conventional correlations to the safety analysis needs experimental verification. A 1/2 scaled test facility from the prototype plant of Wolsong Units 2, 3 and 4 (CANDU 6 type) is used to measure the onset conditions for the gas pull though and liquid entrainment in the seven different orientations of the branch pipe with 0 degrees, +/- 36 degrees, +/- 72 degrees and +/- 90 degrees angles. The horizontal pipe has a diameter of 184 mm. The branch pipes are attached on the horizontal pipe with, and have diameters of 16.7, 20.7 and 24.8 mm, respectively. Air and water are used as working fluids under the conditions of room temperature and of pressures up to 0.95 MPa. The present experimental data were compared with the existing experimental data set such as UCB and KfK and with the horizontal stratification entrainment model (HSEM) in RELAP5/MOD3.3. It was found that The HSEM does not show good agreements with the present data obtained from the specific branch angles, +/- 36 degrees and +/- 72 degrees. At the bottom branch, the quality data are compared with the previous data in terms of h/D. The present data can be used for an improvement of the off-take model in order to predict the onset of off-take and the branch quality at specific angles between -90 degrees and +90 degrees in CANDU.

J	Talamo, A				Talamo, A			Managing helium the reactivity excess of the gas turbine-modular reactor by burnable poison and control rods	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							DEEP-BURN; MONTE-CARLO; NUCLEAR-WASTE; FUEL; HTR; TRANSMUTATION; FEATURES; PROJECT; CORE	The gas turbine-modular helium reactor coupled to the deep burn in-core fuel management strategy offers the extraordinary capability to incinerate over 50% of the initial inventory of fissile material. This extraordinary feature, coming from an advanced and well tested fuel element design, which takes advantage of the TRISO particles technology, is maintained while the reactor is loaded with the most different types of fuels. In the present work, we assumed the reactor operating at the equilibrium of the fuel composition, obtained by a 6 years irradiation of light water reactor waste, and we investigated the effects of the introduction of the burnable poison and the control rods; we equipped the core with all the three types of control rods: operational, startup and shutdown ones. We employed as burnable poison natural erbium, due to the Er-167 increasing neutron capture microscopic cross-section in the energy range where the neutron spectrum exhibits the thermal peak; in addition, we utilized boron carbide, with 90% enrichment in 1013, as the absorption material of the control rods. Concerning the burnable poison studies, we focused on the k(eff) value, the Er-167 mass during burnup, the influence of modifying the radius of the BISO particles kernel and the fuel and moderator coefficients of temperature. Concerning the control rods studies, we investigated the reactivity worth, the changes in the neutron flux profile due to a partial insertion, the influence of modifying the radius of the BISO particles kernel and the beta(eff), at the beginning of the operation.

J	Park, MS; Moon, JH; Kang, CS				Park, MS; Moon, JH; Kang, CS			A study on the degree of deliberation and meditation of cyber poll respondents for nuclear-related decision making	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							SETS	Public participation is essential in each step of the nuclear-related decision-making process. Recently, the electronic systems using the Internet have become quite popular, and have emerged as a good medium for communicating with the public. In this study, a comprehensive utilization of electronic public participation was used to analyze public opinion on a given nuclear-related decision-making process. The degree of deliberation and meditation of the public participating in an electronic poll survey was evaluated, and the decision-making factors representing the personal characteristics of the poll respondents such as age, income, education, residence, degree of knowledge and concern were carefully incorporated when preparing the poll-survey questionnaire for its evaluation. Fuzzy analysis was used to assess and aggregate the responses to each decision-making factor. As a case study, this procedure was used to analyzing public opinion on the location of a low-level radioactive waste disposal facility on the campus of Seoul National University. The results show that there is a tendency of respondents who are on the negative side of the argument to be more deliberate and meditative in their decision-making process than those on the positive side. Knowledge and residence were found to be important decision-making factors. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Jatuff, F; Macku, K; Chawla, R				Jatuff, F; Macku, K; Chawla, R			On the accuracy of reactor physics calculations for square HPLWR fuel assemblies	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							LIGHT-WATER REACTOR; CONCEPTUAL DESIGN	Although the supercritical-pressure or high-performance light water reactor (HPLWR) concept is largely based on the well-established technological experience available with conventional light water reactors, there is still no consensus on various key design features such as an optimal layout for the fuel assembly. This results mainly from the very large density variations of supercritical-pressure water in the core, which render it difficult to ensure reliable values for parameters such as power peaking factors and reactivity worths. The present paper describes studies carried out to compare deterministic and Monte Carlo codes for analysing a representative square HPLWR lattice with uniform 5%-enriched UO2 fuel. The main purpose has been to assess the prediction accuracies achievable for integral parameters such as the multiplication factor, control absorber effectiveness, moderator/coolant density reactivity feedback and pin power distributions. The results show good agreement between the deterministic and stochastic calculations for the unperturbed lattice. However, for certain perturbed situations involving, for example, local coolant density changes in the assembly or control absorber insertion, the observed discrepancies are large enough to question the basic viability of the reactor physics design, e.g. with respect to the thermal performance.

Estimation of the mean-residence time of atmospheric aerosols could be based on measurements of the activities and ratios of activities of cosmic-ray produced radionuclides, such as 7 Be and the radioactive decay products of radon-222 emanated from soil into the atmosphere, such as Pb-210, Po-210 and Po-210. It was found that a mean value of about 8 days could be applied to aerosol particles in the lower atmosphere below precipitation cloud levels as resulted by the application of two different methods, i.e. the 7 Be-associated atmospheric aerosols and the radon decay product aerosols at two different locations, i.e. at Thessaloniki, Greece 40 degrees 38'N 22 degrees 58E with dry (precipitation free) climate and at Oak Ridge.. Tennessee, USA 35 degrees 58'N 84 degrees 17'W with high precipitation (wet climate), roughly at similar temperate latitudes, but the first one at East longitude and the other at West longitude, respectively.

The gamma-rays emitted from the decay of K-40, and the series of Th-232 and U-238, were used to describe the radioactive water source around the NaI crystal. The simulated gamma-ray spectra were compared with real data recorded in situ by a newly constructed NaI spectrometer and were found to be in good agreement. The NaI spectrometer was calibrated in the laboratory in a water tank, before its deployment in seawater. Activity concentrations were deduced from the gamma-ray spectra and discussed in comparison with results from the literature. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Samples were analysed using a low level gamma-ray spectrometer (HPGe) in the laboratory. A total of 205 rock samples were investigated, covering all major rock types of the area. The heat-production rate of igneous rocks ranges from 0.11 (basalt) to 9.53 mu W m(-3) (granite). In metamorphic rocks it varies from 0.28 (serpentinite) to 0.91 mu W m(-3) (metagabbro). The contribution due to U is about 51%, as that from Th is 31% and 18% from K. The corresponding values in igneous rocks are 76%, 19% and 5%, respectively.

In order to characterize and determine their structures, X-ray diffraction and infrared spectrometry were carried out for each sample. The selective absorption properties of each zeolite were found by calculating the distribution coefficient (K-d) of various simulated wastes which were prepared by spiking the radionuclides with I-131, Mo-99, Sm-153, La-140 and Nd-147. All the zeolite samples used in this study had extremely high absorption value towards La-140; clinoptolite from Mianeh and analsite from Ghalehkhargoshi showed good absorption for Nd-147; clinoptolite from Semnan and clinoptolite from Firozkoh showed high absorption for Sm-153; mesolite from Arababad Tabas showed good absorption for Mo-99; and finally mesolite from Arababad Tabas, clinoptolite from Semnan and clinoptolite from Firozkoh could be used to selectively absorb I-131 from the stimulated waste which was prepared. The natural zeolites chosen for these studies show a similar pattern to those synthetic ion exchangers in the literature and in some cases an extremely high selectivity towards certain radioactive elements. Hence the binary separation of radioactive elements could easily be carried out. Furthermore, these zeolites, which are naturally occurring ion exchangers, are viable economically and extremely useful alternatives in this industry. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The intense interaction of the fuel with the matrix material is considered as the main factor limiting the operability of fuel elements in power-dense high-flux nuclear reasearch reactors. It is concluded that low-enrichment high-density uranitan-molybdenym fuel can provide reliable operation of dispersion fuel elements in low- and medium-power research reactors. Such fuel can be used in power-dense high-flux research reactors if the fuel load is decreased below the maximum admissible amount, the compatibility of the uranium-molybdenum alloy with. an aluminum matrix is radically improved, or fuel elements with a different construction, for example, monolithic, are used.

J	Hilden, W				Hilden, W			Nuclear power and sustainable energy supply for Europe	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								Developing and promoting a farsighted energy policy is a key aspect in achieving sustainable development in the European Union. Factors to be coped with in this context are the Union's increasing dependence on energy imports, and the threats facing the climate. Moreover, it is imperative that the Lisbon strategy be pursued, according to which Europe is to be made the world's most dynamic knowledge-based economic region by 2010. As early as in 2000, the EU Commission published its Green Paper, "Towards a European Strategy of Continuity in Power Supply." Continuity of supply, in this context, not only stands for maximized self-sufficiency or minimized dependencies. What is at stake is a reduction of the risks stemming from dependence on imports and from changes in the environment. This goal can be achieved through a balanced and diverse structure both of energy resources and of the geographic origins of fuels. The right energy mix is decisive. The European Commission feels that nuclear power can make an important contribution towards sustainable energy supply in Europe. Nuclear power should keep its place in the European energy mix. One important aspect in this regard is improved public acceptance through communication, transparency, and confidence building. High safety standards and a credible approach to the safe long-term management of radioactive waste are major components of this sustainable energy source.

J	Laaksonen, J				Laaksonen, J			Licensing and supervision of nuclear facilities in Finland	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								In Finland, the licensing process of all nuclear facilities is specified in the Nuclear Energy Act. The licensing procedure comprises three steps, each of which requires a decision by the government: basic decision, construction permit, and operating license. All licensing decisions are taken upon application to the Ministry of Trade and Industry. The Ministry invites comments and opinions on a broad basis and drafts a statement for the government. The basic decision by the government is political, pre-supposing a positive statement by the Central Office for Nuclear Safety (STUK) and a positive decision by the local government of the planned plant location. The construction permit and the operating license are mainly based on points of nuclear safety. STUK is the independent nuclear supervisory agency with administrative powers; its staff has the technical and scientific competence required for safety assessments and for supervision. STUK operates under the supervision of the Ministry for Social Affairs and Health which, to demonstrate its independence, has no duties in the energy sector and, in addition, supervises STUK in administrative matters, not in scientific and technical decisions. Internal rules of STUK ensure neutrality also of its staff in matters of energy policy. The activities of STUK as a supervisory and licensing authority in Finland are described in detail for the management of spent nuclear fuel and the new Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant currently under construction.

J	Bayer, A				Bayer, A			Monitoring systems and reporting in the Federal Republic of Germany	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								In 1955, the German Weather Service (DWD) was commissioned by law to monitor the air and precipitations for radioactive components. Measurements were started in late 1956. On the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of this government commission, an event was organized in June 2005 under the heading of "Fifty Years of Atmospheric Radioactivity Monitoring by the German Weather Service." This contribution summarizes the development of monitoring systems over the past five decades, from the beginnings to dealing with the consequences of the Chernoblyl accident to the present situation. The discussion, also on the basis of historical developments, covers the boundary conditions, treaties, and European and international links and networks. Details are given of the precise duties of monitoring systems for the environment in general and for that of nuclear installations in particular, and of the evaluation of the data so accumulated up to and including the determination of radiation exposures. The Nuclear Reactor Remote Surveillance System (KFU) and the installation and expansion of the Integrated Measurement and Information System for Monitoring Environmental Radioactivity (IMIS) are other key items in the report. The national and the European and international information pathways of the results of measurements and other technical and scientific findings are presented in a comprehensive review also including experience from the Chernobyl accident.

J	Heller, W				Heller, W			Fifty years of German nuclear legislation	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Editorial Material								The political situation and the state of legislation after World War 11 make it difficult to pinpoint a precise date of origin of Gentian nuclear legislation. The restrictions imposed by the Allied High Commission (AHC) without any exception put a ban on the production of uranium and thorium metal as well as the construction of nuclear reactors. These restrictions were lifted expressly when the German Atomic Energy Act (AtG) entered into force on January 1, 1960, i.e. much later than the formal step of gaining sovereignty, which was marked by the protocol of May 5, 1955 terminating the Occupation Statute. In October 1955, the German federal government established the then Federal Ministry for Atomic Matters also in an attempt to reconnect to developments in nuclear fission in other parts of the Western world. To supersede the AHC law, the German federal government in December 1956 publicized a draft Atomic Energy Act. It is safe, therefore, to consider that year the starting point of German atomic legislation. This step was followed by deliberations preparatory to the adoption of the Atomic Energy Act. In 1957, however, adoption failed because no two-thirds majority was reached to amend the Basic Law, i.e. the Constitution. As a consequence, some federal states saw the need to adopt state legislation to regulate this area. On December 3, 1959, a new draft Atomic Energy Act was adopted by the German federal parliament after the second and third readings - coupled with an amendment to the Basic Law on that same day - with the votes of the opposition and with one abstention.									0	0	0	1	2	VERLAGSGRP HANDELSBLATT GMBH	DUSSELDORF	POSTFACH 10 11 02, D-40002 DUSSELDORF, GERMANY	1431-5254			ATW-INT J NUCL POWER	ATW-Int.

The design contains many innovative features to improve both the physics and engineering performance of the system. From the safety and environmental perspective, there is greater depth to the overall analysis than in past ARIES studies. For ARIES-AT, the overall spectrum of off-normal events to be examined has been broadened. They include conventional loss of coolant and loss of flow events, an ex-vessel loss of coolant, and in-vessel off-normal events that mobilize in-vessel inventories (e.g., tritium and tokamak dust) and bypass primary confinement such as a loss of vacuum and an in-vessel loss of coolant with bypass. This broader examination of accidents improves the robustness of the design from the safety perspective and gives additional confidence that the facility can meet the no-evacuation requirement under average weather conditions. We also provide a systematic assessment of the design to address key safety functions such as confinement, decay heat removal, and chemical energy control. In the area of waste management, both the volume of the component and its hazard are used to classify the waste. In comparison to previous ARIES designs, the overall waste volume is less because of the compact design. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Attaining high plant availability is difficult because the fusion power core has a limited service lifetime. Moreover, the core components are radioactive and very large. To assess these issues, the maintainability of the ARIES fusion power core is analyzed and integrated into the early power core design process, which results in a maintainability approach capable of attaining a relatively short refurbishment time. The developed timelines are presented for the scheduled maintenance of the power core. The short core refurbishment time coupled, with evolutionary improvements in the maintainability of the reactor plant equipment and the balance-of-plant equipment, infer an attractive plant availability in the range of 90%.

The hohlraum absorbs ion beam driver energy and emits this energy uniformly around the capsule in the form of X-rays. High-atomic-number materials are necessary in the walls of the hohlraum to contain the X-ray energy around the capsule during the implosion process. These high-atomic-number hohlraum materials affect many aspects of an HIF power plant operation. A systematic review of available information for all high-atomic-number elements was conducted to select candidate hohlraum materials. The effects of materials on target fabrication, energy cost, target gain, radioactivity, chemical toxicity, and potential for recycle were considered. Lead and tungsten are the lowest-cost acceptable materials in the primary coolant. The combination of lead and tungsten provide better target gain than either material alone. Seeding the primary coolant with submicron-sized tungsten particles can minimize tungsten growth in small openings in power plant components such as vacuum tritium disengagers. Concerns remain for possible tungsten particle agglomeration, settling, or erosion caused by tungsten particles. Tungsten could be replaced by several lanthanide elements if tungsten proves unacceptable.

As an alternative to recycling or disposal in repositories, many countries are proceeding successfully with the process of developing clearance guidelines that allow solids and building rubble containing traces of radioisotopes to be cleared from regulatory control and unconditionally released to the commercial market after a specific storage period. With the emergence of new clearance standards, we took the initiative to compare U.S. to European and other international limits. This exercise is proving valuable in understanding the differences between the clearance standards and their implications for the radwaste management of fusion power plants. While clearance standards now exist for most radionuclides that are mainly important to the fission industry, no such standards are in place for many radionuclides of interest to fusion facilities. Before fusion penetrates the energy market, fusion-specific standards should be developed to address the safe release of fusion materials with trace levels of radioactive contamination.

One component of that effort was an examination of the possible transport of radioactivity from sludge into the local environment and the subsequent exposure of humans. A stochastic environmental pathway model was applied separately to seven hypothetical, generic sludge-release scenarios, leading to the creation of seven tables of Dose-to-Source Ratios (DSR), which can be used in translating from specific activity in sludge into dose to an individual. These DSR values were then combined with the results of an ISCORS survey of sludge and ash at more than 300 publicly owned treatment works, to explore the potential for radiation exposure of sludge workers and members of the public.

The activities, ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 mBq m(-3), varied seasonally and were evaluated in terms of meteorological factors. Cosmogenic beryllium (Be-7) concentrations were determined quarterly on the air filters and weekly in deposition collected at one site. Over 98% of the air filters contained observable activity concentrations of Be-7 (mean of 3 mBq m(-3)) and Pb-210 (mean of 1 mBq m(-3)). However, only 20% of deposition samples contained Be-7 concentrations above analytical detection limits. Tritium (H-3) concentrations were below detection limits in deposition samples at the background site, but were present on most samples collected near a 3 H-processing facility. Measurements of I-131 were conducted weekly on charcoal canisters, with only one site showing observable concentrations (mean of 1 mBq m(-3)), due to nearby incineration of dried municipal sludge containing patient waste from hospital treatments.

The model uses a time-dependent growth equation of a plant so that it can predict the contamination level of tritium depending on the stage of the growth of the plant, which is a major difference from some other compartment models using a constant crop yield. The model is able to calculate the time variable concentrations of the compartments representing the atmosphere, soil, and plants of four categories including leafy vegetables, root vegetables, grains, and tuber plants. Experimental results include the tissue free water tritium (TFWT) and the organically bound tritium (OBT) concentration of rice, soybean, cabbage, and radish exposed to HTO vapor for I h in the daytime at different growth stages. The model predictions showed that the model could simulate well not only the time-dependent tritium concentration of the plants but also the effect of the growth stage of the plant at the exposure time. Comparison of the model predictions with the experimental results suggested that the model could predict reasonably well the observed TFWT and OBT concentrations of the plants considered.

Materials and methods: Separated PBL were exposed in G(0) to 0.5 Gy Pu-238 alpha-particles, stimulated to divide and harvested similar to 48-50 hours after exposure. Metaphase cells were assayed by m-FISH and chromosome breaks identified. The observed distribution of breaks were then compared with expected distributions of breaks, calculated on the assumption that the distribution of breaks is random with regard to either chromosome volume or chromosome surface area. Results: More breaks than expected were observed on chromosomes 2 and 11, however no particular region of either chromosome was identified as significantly contributing to this over-representation. The identification of hot or cold chromosome regions (pter,p,cen,q,qter) varied depending on whether the data were compared according to chromosome volume or surface area. Conclusions: A deviation from randomness in chromosome breakpoint distribution was observed, and this was greatest when data were compared according to the relative surface area of each individual chromosome (or region). The identification of breaks by m-FISH (i.e., more efficient observation of interchanges than intrachanges) and importance of territorial boundaries on interchange formation are thought to contribute to these differences. The significance of the observed non-random distribution of breaks on chromosomes 2 and 11 in relation to chromatin organization is unclear.

The H2O2 species is either added to water or produced by radiolysis at UO2/H2O interfaces. The concentrations vary in the range 10(-5)-10(-1) mol l(-1). The radiolysis is induced by irradiating the UO2/H2O interfaces with a He2+-beam emerging from the UO2 discs into the solutions. Both the evolution of the aqueous solutions and the UO2 surfaces are characterised. In both types of experiments, the alteration Of UO2 results in the formation of the same secondary phase, an hydrated uranium peroxide called studtite (UO2(O)(2) center dot 4H(2)O). However, the uranium release at the interface differs strikingly. It is much higher when H2O2 is produced by irradiation than when it is simply added. Furthermore, it varies in opposite direction as a function of the H2O2 concentration. This gives evidence that the chemistry at the UO2 interface under irradiation differs significantly from the chemistry induced by simply adding H2O2 to the solution. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry is used to determine the growth rate of the corrosion layer. For H2O, addition, the layer thickness increases with increasing leaching time, although as time increases, the U release tends towards zero. It is possible to establish the first empirical equation relating the corrosion rates to the added H2O2 concentrations.

Ion energies of deuterium and helium were taken at 1.7 and 5 keV, respectively. The retained amount of deuterium in the sample irradiated at 380 K increased with the ion fluence and was not saturated to fluence of up to 1 x 10(23) D/m(2). For the irradiation at 773 K, 0.1% of implanted deuterium was retained at the highest fluence. For the helium ion irradiation at room temperature, three groups of desorption peaks appeared at around 500, 850, and 1200 K in the TDS spectrum. In the lower fluence region (< 1 x 10(21) He/m(2)), the retained helium desorbed mainly at around 1200 K. With increasing fluence, the amount desorbed at 500 K increased. Total amount of retained helium in the samples saturated at fluence up to 5 x 10(21) He/m(2) and saturation level was 2.7 x 10(21) He/m(2). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lexa, D; Kropf, AJ				Lexa, D; Kropf, AJ			Thermal, structural, and radiological properties of irradiated graphite from the ASTRA research reactor - Implications for disposal	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							DEFECTS	The release of Wigner energy from the graphite of the inner thermal column of the ASTRA research reactor has been studied by differential scanning calorimetry and simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry/synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction between 25 degrees C and 725 degrees C at a heating rate of 10 degrees C min(-1). The graphite, having been subject to a fast-neutron fluence from similar to 10(17) to similar to 10(20) n cm(-2) over the life time of the reactor at temperatures not exceeding 100 degrees C, exhibits Wigner energies ranging from 25 to 572 J g(-1) and a Wigner energy accumulation rate of similar to 7 x 10(-17) J g(-1)/n cm(-2). The shape of the rate-of-heat-release curves, e.g., maximum at ca. 200 degrees C and a fine structure at higher temperatures, varies with sample position within the inner thermal column, i.e., the distance from the reactor core. Crystal structure of samples closest to the reactor core (fast-neutron fluence > 1.5-5.0 x 10(19) n cm(-2)) is destroyed while that of samples farther from the reactor core (fast-neutron fluence < 1.5-5.0 x 10(19) n cm(-2)) is intact, with marked swelling along the c-axis. The dependence of the c lattice parameter on temperature between 25 degrees C and 200 degrees C as determined by Rietveld refinement for the non-amorphous samples leads to the expected microscopic thermal expansion coefficient along the c-axis of similar to 26 x 10(-6) degrees C-1. However, at 200 degrees C, coinciding with the maximum in the rate-of-heat-release curves, the rate of thermal expansion abruptly decreases indicating a crystal lattice relaxation. The C-14 activity in the inner thermal column graphite ranges from 6 to 467 kBq g(-1). The graphite of the inner thermal column of the ASTRA research reactor has been treated by heating to 400 degrees C for 24 h in a hot-cell facility prior to interim storage. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The critical issues for realization of the neutron generator are the mechanical structure of a target with cooling capability and its integrity under operating conditions with powers as high as 50 MeV x 300 mu A. The integrity of a target structure design has been confirmed by thermal and stress analyses with a finite element method code ANSYS. Moreover, a target replacement strategy is also studied based on a radioactivity evaluation performed by the IRACM code system. In addition to the target structure design, the neutronics design has been optimized with the Monte Carlo code MCNPX. A high epithermal neutron flux of 1.8 x 10(9) cm(-2)-s(-1) has been achieved at the aperture of the collimator, which allows a RBE dose of over 30 Gy-eq to be delivered to a brain tumor within 5.9 cm in phantom depth for a therapeutic time of 31 min.
