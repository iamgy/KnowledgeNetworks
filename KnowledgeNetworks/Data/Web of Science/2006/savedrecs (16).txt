J	Tufail, M; Akhtar, N; Waqas, M				Tufail, M; Akhtar, N; Waqas, M			Radioactive rock phosphate: The feed stock of phosphate fertilizers used in Pakistan	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						dose assessment; K-40; Ra-226; Th-232	NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; BUILDING-MATERIALS; DEPOSITS; PRODUCTS; EGYPT	The existence of natural radioactivity in phosphate fertilizers originates from the rock phosphate that is used as a feed stock for the manufacturing of various types of phosphate fertilizers. Gamma ray activity mass concentrations have been determined in phosphate rock and fertilizer samples collected from different fertilizer manufacturing factories and suppliers in Pakistan. The technique of gamma ray spectrometry was applied using a HPGe (high purity germanium) gamma ray detector coupled with a personal computer (PC) based multichannel analyzer (MCA). The specific activity values of K-40, Ra-226, and Th-232 were widely distributed in the rock and fertilizer samples. Activity mass concentrations of U-238 (Ra-226) in the rock phosphate from Jordan and Pakistan were 428 +/- 11 and 799 +/- 10 Bq kg(-1), respectively, and that in the triple-superphosphate fertilizer was 701 +/- 21 Bq kg(-1) which was greater than the average values of U-238 (Ra-226) for other types of fertilizers under study. The concentrations of K-40 and Th-232 were of the order of background level on the Earth's crust. Chemical analysis for concentration of different constituents in rock phosphate was also carried out. The higher the concentrations of P2O5 and K2O were, the higher the specific activities of Ra-226 and K-40 were, respectively, in the rocks under study. The amount of radioactivity in the rock phosphate is a source of continuous exposure to radiation, which varies widely depending upon the origin and grade of rock; therefore, radiation dose rate has been estimated. The values of dose rate and other derived quantities were many folds larger than the limits specified for those quantities.

The contents of uranium and thorium were determined using instrumental neutron activation analysis and gamma spectroscopy. The results obtained using the two methods have shown satisfactory correlation. The tests confirm that magnetite and limonite are suitable as concrete aggregate while hematite is not because of its friable nature and high contents of uranium, thorium, and cobalt.

J	Musolino, SV; Harper, FT				Musolino, SV; Harper, FT			Emergency response guidance for the first 48 hours after the outdoor detonation of an explosive radiological dispersal device	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						emergency planning; terrorism; aerosols; emergencies, radiological		Strategies and decisions to protect emergency responders, the public, and critical infrastructure against the effects of a radiological dispersal device detonated outdoors must be made in the planning stage, not in the early period just after an attack. This contrasts with planning for small-scale types of radiological or nuclear emergencies, or for a large-scale nuclear-power-type accident that evolves over many hours or days before radioactivity is released to the environment, such that its effects can be prospectively modeled and analyzed. By the time it is known an attack has occurred, most likely there will have been casualties, all the radioactive material will have been released, plume growth will be progressing, and there will be no time left for evaluating possible countermeasures. This paper offers guidance to planners, first responders, and senior decision makers to assist them in developing strategies for protective actions and operational procedures for the first 48 hours after an explosive radiological dispersal device has been detonated.

To increase sensitivity, monitoring stations use a complex system of separate beta and gamma detectors to detect beta-gamma coincidences from the Xe isotopes of interest, which is effective but requires such careful gain matching and calibration that it is difficult to operate in the field. To simplify the system, a phoswich detector has been designed, consisting of optically coupled plastic and CsI scintillators to absorb beta particles and gamma rays, respectively. Digital pulse shape analysis (PSA) of the detector signal is used to determine if radiation interacted in either or both parts of the detector and to measure the energy deposited in each part, thus using only a single channel of readout electronics to detect beta-gamma coincidences and to measure both energies. Experiments with a prototype detector show that the technique can clearly separate event types, does not degrade the energy resolution, and has an error rate for detecting coincidences of less than 0.1%. Monte Carlo simulations of radiation transport and light collection in the proposed detector were performed to obtain optimum values for its design parameters and an estimate of the coincidence detection efficiency (82%-92%) and the background rejection rate (better than 99%).

A stable reference laser has been developed using magnetically induced circular dichroism of atomic rubidium. The frequency stability was estimated to be 50 kHz over 8-h period from beat frequency measurement. Furthermore, a computer-controlled fringe offset lock system has been developed to transfer the high frequency stability to the other lasers for three-step excitation of atomic calcium. By using the system precise frequency tuning of 1 MHz error over 1 GHz scan was realized. The overall frequency tuning precision was also confirmed by a multistep fluorescence and resonance ionization spectroscopy of calcium.

Desorbed gases and erosion depth were measured by a quadrupole mass spectrometer and an optical microscope, respectively. Erosion depth revealed that ablation of carbon occurred at laser intensity I-Lv > 9 x 10(9) W/cm(2). It was found that retained hydrogen desorbed mainly as H-2 and C2H2 accompanying minor contribution of other hydrocarbon molecules, but much less as H2O molecules by the laser ablation. It was also found that most of the retained hydrogen on the re-deposited layer was removed by the laser ablation. It appeared that for the higher I-L, hydrogen can be removed more quickly with less production of hydrocarbons. These results suggest that LID has a superior nature as a tritium removal method.

DD and/or DT fusion reaction or nuclear burning reaction provides two kinds of neutrons, DD neutron and DT neutron, respectively. DD/DT burning ratio, which can be estimated by DD/DT neutron ratio in the burning plasma, is essential for burn control, alpha particle emission rate monitoring and tritium fuel cycle estimation. Here we propose a new neutron spectrometer for the absolute DD/DT burning ratio measurement. The system consists of a Proton Recoil Telescope (PRT) and a Time-of-Flight (TOF) technique. We have conducted preliminary experiments with a prototype detector and a DT neutron beam (phi 20 mm) at the Fusion Neutronics Source, Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA), to assess its basic performance. The detection efficiency obtained by the experiment is consistent with the calculation results in PRT, and sufficient energy resolution for the DD/DT neutron discrimination has been achieved in PRT and TOF. The validity of the Monte Carlo calculation has also been confirmed by comparing the experimental results with the calculation results. The design consideration of this system for use in ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) has shown that this system is capable of monitoring the line-integrated DD/DT burning ratio for the plasma core line of sight with the required measurement accuracy of 20% in the upper 4 decades of the ITER operation (fusion power: 100 kW-700 MW).

From the perspective of waste management, Co-60 induced in Havar foil should be taken into consideration. Because the exempt activity of Co-60 in BSS is 0.1 MBq, the used Havar foil should be managed more than for 20 years. The radionuclides in the [F-18]-FDG synthesis apparatus are negligible. Equivalent doses at skin and to tissues were estimated assuming a point source at a distance of 30 cm in air. The annual equivalent doses at skin and equivalent dose at deep tissues of such an operating staff will be 56 and 8.3 mu Sv, respectively, as two times the remove of the target foil and five hundreds times the synthesis of the [F-18]-FDG. When proper radiation protection is provided, the exposure from the cyclotron management and the [18F]-FDG synthesis process will not cause meaningful radiological risk to the operating staff. The activity concentration of H-3, 180 kBq(.)cm(-3), detected in the target water, is 3,000 times the legal limit of effluent for H-3. The operators should take care of the treatment of the target water when they make a distillation for reuse and a disposal.

It has been confirmed that the current ISS design well covers the operational requirements of the designated operation modes and other anticipated operations. However, some operation modes using rich deuterium fuel will require additional tritium inventory in the system (not only for ISS but the storage system in some cases) and make duration time between the operations longer. Operation scenario of ISS for a demo reactor will be quite simple, but the process capacity required being associated with detritiation of coolant water become excessively large without any countermeasure to control/reduce tritium permeation in the bleeding blanket operated at a temperature much higher than that of ITER.

Fissile enrichment should be, therefore, accurately managed in order to carry out it. A concept of physical accounting method for adjusting fissile enrichment is very useful to manage plutonium content and to control reactivity of nuclear reactor where plutonium is used as main fissile material. The basis of the concept is shown in this paper together with the result of the application to typical prototype fast breeder reactor (FBR). The rationality for adopting the method is also quantitatively shown in this paper.

In particular, deployment of recovered molybdenum from the spent nuclear fuel is highlighted and its nuclear effects are focused on in comparison to other types of molybdenum, namely natural and enriched ones. A preliminary investigation for effects of molybdenum isotopic composition on fast reactor core characteristics were carried out using nuclear calculation codes. The results indicated the feasibility of the fast reactor core loaded with the present target by optimizing its amount and composition. Moreover, several additional gains were indicated such as possible use of the radioactive waste and production of a new energy source, U-233.

The Si3N4 films were prepared by using reactive RF-magnetron-sputter-deposition method in N-2 (natural isotope abundance) gas at room temperature. The composition and film thickness were measured by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) and optical absorption spectroscopy. The RBS and optical absorption spectroscopy show increase in the film thickness with the stoichiometric composition, by N-15 ion implantation. These results and depth distribution of the implanted N-15, which is obtained by nuclear reaction analysis (NRA), lead to formation of Si-3 N-15(4) film (embedded isotope rich nitride film). Enrichment of N-15 in the grown silicon-nitride film is estimated to be similar to 70%.

Urey; chemical exchange; product-end reflux	NITRIC-OXIDE; FRACTIONATION; SEPARATION; CARBON; GAS	The chemical exchange isotope enrichment process has an advantage over other isotope separation methods in that it involves two chemicals rather than one and, consequently, relatively large separation factors can be obtained. However, the chemical exchange method requires a chemical conversion of the substance enriched in the target isotope into the second substance. The idiosyncrasies of the isotope separation process by this method are pointed out using McCabe-Thiele diagram and, from them, the difficulties involved in the chemical exchange methods are itemized.

The experimentally observed isotopic separation coefficient, 6, was converted to the isotopic equilibrium constant, ln K = epsilon(o), of the U(IV)-U(VI) exchange reaction with the aid of the experimentally measured ionic mole fractions of U(IV) and U(VI) in the resin phase and the aqueous solution phase. The plots of epsilon(o) vs. I/T led to the temperature dependence of epsilon(o) = 0.69/T-82/T-2, where the first term is due to the nuclear field effect (nuclear-electron interaction effect) and the second term is due to the molecular-vibration mass effect. The discussion is extended to the temperature dependence of the previously reported isotope effects in the U(III)-U(IV) electron exchange reaction, and the U(VI)-malate-complex ligand exchange reaction.

This resin was synthesized in the pores of silica beads for chromatography use. Larger adsorption of zinc was obtained in the case of acetic acid derivatives than in protic solvent such as water and alcohol by the batch treatment. The displacement chromatography was conducted to study zinc isotope separation. The isotope separation coefficient epsilon = 0.32 x 10(-3), 0.69 x 10(-3) and HETP = 0.2268, 0.3968 cm were determined for isotopic pair of Zn-68/Zn-64 at 25 degrees C by five meters migration experiment using methyl isobutyl ketone and acetic acid, respectively. The improvement of enrichment ratio is very small between 1 and 5 m migration. Hydrogen chloride and/or water obviously reduce zinc adsorption to this resin.

Various studies of chromatographic separation of boron isotopes have been carried out, but few have addressed effects of base polymer skeletons. In this study, we used three glucamine type resins, which have different base polymer skeletons: synthesized GMA-DVB-Glu, commercial Diaion CRB02 and Chelest Fiber GRY-L. They were packed in chromatographic columns (1 m length x 1 cm I.D.). They were subsequently evaluated for properties of boron isotope separation by band, breakthrough and reverse-breakthrough operations. The GRY-L showed larger fractionation for boron isotopes than other resins. In a 1 m column operation, the GRY-L showed fractionated B-11 enrichment fraction (delta B-10=-219 parts per thousand) at the breakthrough process and B-10 enrichment fraction (delta B-10=288 parts per thousand) at the reverse-breakthrough process from a NIST SRM 951 boric acid. Enrichment factors at the front part and rear part were calculated from clearly enriched fractions. The GRY-L yielded enriched B-10 over 1.10 times' natural abundance in the rear part at 1 m column reverse-breakthrough operation. The GRY-L is promising as a packing material of column chromatography for boron isotope separation.

Clusters of deuterium labeled methyl-formate-d (MFD), (DC(O)OCH3), were excited with monochromatized synchrotron radiation in the oxygen K-edge (530-545 eV). Time-of-flight (TOF) fragment-mass spectra of MFD clusters showed the production for series of heterogeneous (MFD)(m)D+ and (MFD)(n)CH3OD2+ clusters as well as CH3OD2+ fragment via D/D+ transfer processes within the clusters. Dissociative double ionization within the clusters was measured here by photoelectron-photoion-photoion coincidence (PEPIPICO) technique. Product cation pairs of the heterogeneous clusters were found to be produced exclusively from doubly charged MFD clusters. The dissociation mechanisms and dynamics of the doubly charged MFD clusters are discussed in terms of kinetic energy release (KER) and charge separation distance (CSD).

Solvent isotope effects and the question of quantum tunneling in hydrolytic enzyme action	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Symposium on Isotope Science and Engineering from Basics to Applications (ISE 2005)	SEP 21-23, 2005	Nagoya, JAPAN	Nagoya Univ, 21st Cent COE Program		catalysis; trypsin; deuterium oxide; solvent isotope effect; quantum tunneling; enzyme; mechanism; hydrolysis; general-base catalysis	PROTON-TRANSFER; HYDROGEN; CATALYSIS	The hydrolysis of acyl-derivatives with catalysis by bovine pancreatic trypsin generates solvent isotope effects on the rate constant k(cat) (k(cat)(HOH)/k(cat)(DOD)) of around 1.5 to 4, depending on the structure of the substrate. The abbreviated substrate N-benzoyl-arginyl ethyl ester has been reported to produce temperature-independent solvent isotope effects of 2.5 to 2.6 between 5 and 45 degrees C, and the measurements are roughly confirmed by new measurements reported here. The previous interpretation, positing formation of a tunneling state followed by quantum tunneling of the hydron, remains possible, but it is now shown that kinetic complexity may in fact be obscuring a traditional temperature dependence of the isotope effect that does not require quantum tunneling.

The outdoor absorbed dose rate levels were analyzed in connection to airborne natural radioactivity and meteorological parameters, such as precipitation, air temperature and pressure.The minimum values were recorded in winter and the maximum values at the end of summer or beginning of autumn, mainly as a consequence of changes in weather and soil conditions (rain, ground moisture, snow cover).Significant statistical correlations were obtained between the outdoor absorbed dose rate and the air temperature and atmospheric pressure, respectively.

J	Ranjbar, AH; Barghordar, H				Ranjbar, AH; Barghordar, H			Activity concentration of Rn-222 released from crushed granite stones of Iranian origin	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							RADON EXHALATION; INDOOR AIR; RADIATION; RISK	The activity concentration of Rn-222, emanated from crushed granite, has been determined by track technique using CR-39 plastic detectors. The crushed materials were transferred to plastic containers, where several detectors were placed high above the level of the materials. The containers were sealed and left for 185 days. The etched alpha-tracks were then counted under an optical microscope. The calibration factor of 0.075 +/- 0.001 kBq.m(-3) per tracks cm(-2) has been used to express the Rn-222 activity in Bq.m(-3). The activity concentration of Rn-222, released from the crushed granite stones, was found to be 1.605 +/- 0.055 kBq.m(-3) while the average radon level during this period (185 days) in the laboratory air was found to be 5 +/- 1 Bq.m(-3), using an AlphaGUARD equipment. The former concentration value lies about 4 times higher than the action levels (200-600 Bq.m(-3)) recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and 320 times higher than the radon level of the laboratory atmosphere. This seems reasonable, as the uranium and radium content of the granite stone has been shown to be high and could considerably increase the radon level of their area. It can be a health risk to the indoor users of granite material and, therefore, remediation is required.

The chemical analysis reveals that in these muscovites, the interlayer sites are occupied mainly by K, Fe, Rb Na, and traces of Mg and Ca in the octahedral positions whilst Si, Al, Ti Mn occur in the tetrahedral ones. The low Na/(Na+ K) ratios, low Ti content and enrichment in Rb in the muscovite suggest postmagmatic genesis of the host rocks. The variability in trace element composition may reflect differences in geological environment of emplacement of the pegmatite bodies.

J	Struminska, DI; Skwarzec, B				Struminska, DI; Skwarzec, B			Pu-241 concentration in southern Baltic Sea ecosystem	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ENVIRONMENTAL-SAMPLES; PLUTONIUM; SOIL; POLONIUM; URANIUM	Pu-241 concentrations were calculated indirectly in different compartments of the southern Baltic ecosystem by the activity measurements of Am-241 isotope from the increase of the beta-emitting Pu-241 at 16-18 years after the Chernobyl accident. Enhanced levels of Pu-241 were observed in all analyzed samples. Maximum values (0.408 and 0.367 mBq.g(-1) d.w.) of the estimated Pu-241 concentrations were found in sediments of Internal Puck Bay and Gdanask Bay, respectively, and in the suspended matter from water of Gdanask Bay (77.8 mBq.g(-1) d.w.). The highest Pu-241/Pu239+240 activity ratio was found in the suspended matter (1500) and water (140). The Pu-241 activity of the air dust was very high in April 1986, 3643 +/- 34.3 mBq.g(-1) d.w., and the Pu-241/Pu239+240 activity ratio was 56, but the highest Pu-241/Pu239+240 activity ratio of the air dust was measured in August. Then the Pu-241 concentration in air dust decreased quickly to values similar to those before the Chernobyl accident. This study provides new data for the Pu-241 concentrations in various compartments of the Baltic Sea ecosystem.

The method employs a combination of precipitation and solvent extraction procedure to eliminate other beta-impurities prior to resorting to the estimation of Sr-90 by beta-counting. Ru-106 was eliminated by volatalizing with perchloric acid, uranium was removed by carrier precipitation with strontium as sulphate. The sulphate precipitate was converted to carbonate and dissolved in nitric acid. Th-234 and Pa-234 were eliminated by synergistic solvent extraction using tri-n-butyl phosphate and thenoyl trifluoroacetone extractant mixture in xylene. An iron scavenging step was included to remove any residual impurities. Finally, strontium is precipitated as SrC2O4 center dot H2O. The separated Sr-90 activity was followed to check the equilibrium growth of Y-90.

The characteristic gamma- and X-lines of uranium were measured using a low energy Ge gamma-spectrometer. The simulation results agreed with the experimental data and showed obvious correlation between the self-attenuation correction and the intensity ratios [(185.7 keV)/(143.8 keV), (98.44 keV)/(185.7 keV) and (185.7 keV)/(63.23 keV)]. This correlation greatly simplifies the determination of the self-attenuation correction and reduces the troublesome traditional procedures used to determine this coefficient.

J	Sinha, RK; Kakodkar, A				Sinha, RK; Kakodkar, A			Design and development of the AHWR - the Indian thorium fuelled innovative nuclear reactor	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							BEHAVIOR	India has chalked out a nuclear power program based on its domestic resource position of uranium and thorium. The first stage started with setting up the Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWR) based on natural uranium and pressure tube technology. In the second phase, the fissile material base will be multiplied in Fast Breeder Reactors using the plutonium obtained from the PHWRs. Considering the large thorium reserves in India, the future nuclear power program will be based on thorium-U-233 fuel cycle. However, there is a need for the timely development of thorium-based technologies for the entire fuel cycle. The Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR) has been designed to fulfill this need. The AHWR is it 300 MW,, vertical, pressure tube type, heavy water moderated, boiling light water cooled natural circulation reactor. The fuel consists of (Th-Pu)O-2 and (Th-U-233)O-2 pins. The fuel cluster is designed to generate maximum energy out of U-233, which is bred in situ from thorium and has a slightly negative void coefficient of reactivity. For the AHWR, the well-proven pressure tube technology has been adopted and many passive safety features, consistent with the international trend, have been incorporated. A distinguishing feature which makes this reactor unique, from other conventional nuclear power reactors is the fact that it is designed to remove core heat by natural circulation. under normal operating conditions, eliminating the need of pumps. In addition to this passive feature, several innovative passive safety systems have been incorporated in the design, for decay heat removal under shut down condition and mitigation of postulated accident conditions. The design of the reactor has progressively undergone modifications and improvements based on the feedbacks from the analytical and the experimental R&D. This paper gives the details of the current design of the AHWR. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Bajaj, SS; Gore, AR				Bajaj, SS; Gore, AR			The Indian PHWR	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								The nuclear power program in India at present is based mainly on a series of Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs). Starting from Rajasthan Atomic Power Station comprising two units of 200 MW, Canadian designed PHWRs in 1973, the program has come a long way with 12 PHWR units in operation and 6 units under construction which includes 2 units of 540 MW, PHWRs. Narora Atomic Power Station commissioned in 1991 marked major indigenization and standardization of PHWR designs. The choice of PHWRs in the current stage of India's Nuclear Power Plants program is based on long-term objectives in the right available resources and infrastructure. These reactors use natural uranium as fuel and heavy water as moderator and coolant. The nuclear power stations in India are generally planned as twin-unit modules. sharing common facilities such as service building, spent fuel bay, etc. This paper brings out the key features of the design of Indian PHWR, highlighting the areas of evolution in successive project. Also covered are highlights of the operating experience with these reactors. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Dey, PK; Bansal, NK				Dey, PK; Bansal, NK			Spent fuel reprocessing: A vital link in Indian nuclear power program	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								The success of the three stage Indian nuclear energy program is inter-linked with the establishment of an efficient closed fuel cycle approach with recycling of both fissile and fertile components of the spent fuel to appropriate reactor systems. The Indian reprocessing journey was started way back in 1964 with the commissioning of a plant based on PUREX technology to reprocess aluminum clad natural uranium spent fuel from the research reactor CIRUS. After achieving the basic skills, a power reactor reprocessing facility was built to reprocess spent fuel from power reactors. Adequate design and operating experience was gained from these two plants for mastering the reprocessing technology. The first plant, being the maiden venture, based on indigenous technology had to undergo many modifications during its operation and finally needed refurbishment for continued operation. Decommissioning and decontamination of this plant was carried out meticulously to allow unrestricted access to the cells for fresh installation. A third plant was built for power reactor spent fuel reprocessing to serve as a design standard for future plants with the involvement of industry. Over the years. spent fuel reprocessing based on PUREX technology has reached a matured status and can be safely deployed to meet the additional reprocessing requirements to cater to the expanding nuclear energy program. Side by side with the developments in the spent natural uranium fuel reprocessing, irradiated thoria reprocessing is also perused to develop THOREX into a robust process. The additional challenges in this domain are being addressed to evolve appropriate technological solutions. Advancements in the field of science and technology are being absorbed to meet the challenges of higher recovery combined with reduced exposure and environmental discharges. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In addition production of radioisotopes of high specific activity and the diverse requirements of a broad based user community had to be synthesized into a viable system, which could be engineered within the limited means available in the country. This high neutron flux reactor was designed, constructed and commissioned entirely by Indian scientists and engineers and it reflects the country's resolve to achieve self-reliance in the nuclear reactor technology. Dhruva is a 100 MW (thermal) research reactor with metallic natural uranium as fuel, heavy water as moderator. coolant and reflector, giving a maximum thermal neutron flux of 1.8 x 10(14) n/cm(2)/s. Since its first criticality on 8th August 1985, a number of experimental facilities have been added which have proven to be highly attractive for universities and industrial researchers for their scientific merits in various fields. One of the major utilization areas has been the neutron beam research using several neutron spectrometers, all of which were built in-house. A guide tube facility comprising of two neutron guides and another experimental set-up with a multi-instrument beam line have enabled further enhancement of the utilization of this National Facility by the academic institutions in the country. Production of radioisotopes of high specific activity and in increased quantity has fulfilled growing demands for many applications. The write-up provides an overview of the reactor covering its design; layout. safety features, utilization and operating experience along with description of some of the specific experimental facilities.

The nuclear power program started with the setting up of two units of boiling light water type reactors in 1969 for speedy establishment of nuclear technology, safety culture, and development of operation and maintenance manpower. The main aim at that stage was to demonstrate (to ourselves, and indeed to the rest of the world) that India, inspire of being a developing country, with limited industrial infrastructure and low capacity power grids, could successfully assimilate the high technology involved in the safe and economical operation of nuclear power reactors. The selection of a BWR was in contrast to the pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWR), which was identified as the flagship for the first stage of India's nuclear power program. The Iona-term program in three stages utilizes large reserves of thorium in the monazite sands of Kerala beaches in the third stage with first stage comprising of series of PHWR type plants with a base of 10,000 MW. India has at present 14 reactors in operation 12 of these being of PHWR type. The performance of operating units of 2720 MW has improved significantly with an overall capacity factor of about 90% in recent times. The construction work on eight reactor units with installed capacity of 3960 MW (two PHWRs of 540 MW each, four PHWRs of 220 MW each and two VVERs of 1000 MW each) is proceeding on a rapid pace with project schedules of less than 5 years from first pour of concrete. This is being achieved through advanced construction technology and management. Present efforts are focused on further reduction of gestation period. This is in contrast to construction period of 7-14 years in the earlier projects with labour intensive construction methods, learning period and indigenisation. The schedule and cost are interrelated and ultimately determine the viability and competitive edge of a project. With rich experience Of over 30 years of operation and construction management it is well established that setting up of nuclear power projects in India in 4-5 years is quite feasible because of tremendous developments in construction technology; mechanization, parallel civil works and equipment erection, computerized project monitoring and accounting systems. By considering the best achieved times for the critical path activities of previous and ongoing projects, even a 4-year schedule is achievable. For nuclear power to be competitive it is essential that the gestation period is reduced and the capacity utilization enhanced. Both of these are the goals of the Indian nuclear power program. Presently the overnight cost per kW installed capacity is in the range of US$ 1100-1300 with levellised tariff of 5 c/kWh. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The primary energy resource for electricity generation in the country is coal. The potential of other resources like gas, oil, wind, solar and biomass is very limited. The only viable and sustainable resource is the nuclear energy. Presently, Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors utilizing natural uranium are in operation/under construction and the plutonium generated from these reactors will be multiplied through breeding in fast breeder reactors. The successful construction, commissioning and operation of Fast Breeder Test Reactor at Kalpakkam has given confidence to embark on the construction of the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR). This paper describes the salient design features of PFBR including the design of the reactor core, reactor assembly, main heat transport systems, component handling, steam water system, electrical power systems, instrumentation and control, plant layout, safety and research and development.

J	Raj, K; Prasad, KK; Bansal, NK				Raj, K; Prasad, KK; Bansal, NK			Radioactive waste management practices in India	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								Concern for the environment and establishment of radiation protection goals have been among the major priorities in planning of India's nuclear energy programme. In the Indian nuclear fuel cycle, right from inception. a closed loop option has been adopted where spent fuel is reprocessed to recover plutonium and unused uranium. The emphasis has been to recover actinides, individual fission products and recycle them back to the fuel cycle or use them for various industrial applications. The development of innovative treatment processes for low and intermediate level wastes in recent times has focused on volume reduction as one of the main objectives. In the case of high-level liquid waste, vitrification in borosilicate matrix is being practiced using induction heated metallic melters at industrial scale plants at Tarapur and Trombay. Currently, there are seven operating near surface disposal facilities co-located with power/research reactors in various parts of the country for disposal of low and intermediate level solid wastes. These are routinely subjected to monitoring and safety/performance assessment. An interim storage facility is operational for the storage of vitrified high-level waste overpacks for 30 years or more. Nation wide screening of potential regions and evaluation of rock mass characteristics is in progress for ongoing geological repository programme. Preliminary design and layout of an underground research laboratory/repository has also been initiated. A research programme is underway for long-term evaluation of vitrified waste product under simulated repository conditions. Research is also directed towards development of advanced technologies for waste processing as well as conditioning in vitreous and ceramic matrices. The Department of Atomic Energy with participation of the Indian industry has developed all essential remote-handling gadgets required for operation and maintenance of waste management system and assemblies including decommissioning.

The charge distribution was investigated in various gases and solids. We observed a gas-solid effect in ionization and mean charge. This effect arises from the shorter collision time in solids comparable with the lifetimes of the excited states of the projectile. Simultaneously, the stopping force was measured for the same targets. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The 9C-ion C beam, especially at the distal side of the beam came out more efficient in cell killing at the depths around its Bragg peak than the 12 Bragg peak. Compared to the C-12 beam, an increase in RBE by a factor of up to 2.13 has been observed at the depths distal to the Bragg peak of the 9C beam. The 9C beam showed an enhanced biological effect at the penetration depths around its Bragg peak, corresponding to the stopping region of the incident C-9-ions and where the delayed low-energy particles were emitted. Further analysis revealed that cell lethality by the emitted particles from the stopping C-9-ions is responsible for the excessive biological effect at the penetration depths around the Bragg peak of the C-9 beam.

There is a strong correlation between the etching rate of detector and the enrichment E of uranium particle: the former increases as the latter increases. Particularly, the etching rate per particle was proportional to E-2/3 rather than El, which is probably due to the overlapping of fission tracks. The etching behaviors of detector revealed that the existence of two different etching rate regions, a nonlinear region in the beginning of etching process and a subsequent constant region, which was explained as the opening of fission tracks and the broadening of opened tracks, respectively. The enrichment dependence of bulk etch of a detector was qualitatively the same in two different etching rate regions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thanks to the excellent neutron economy of the uranium-free fuel employed, the pin pitch to diameter ratio (P/D) could be increased to 1.8. The increased coolant fraction allows for decay heat removal at ambient pressure. The large coolant fraction further results in a low, pressure loss-26 kPa over the core, 35 kPa in. total. Thanks to the large P/D, the elevation of the heat exchanger necessary to remove decay heat by natural circulation is just more than I m. The absence of uranium in conjunction. with the presence of 35% (heavy atom) americium in the fuel results in a low effective delayed neutron fraction and a vanishing Doppler feedback, making subcritical operation mandatory.

Despite very low probability, they involve a direct path way for radioactivity release into the environment. Nonetheless, fission products could be partially retained in. the secondary side of the steam generator, even in the absence of water. This paper summarizes the main results of a bench-scale experimental program focused on the aerosol retention near the tube breach at the secondary side of a dry steam generator. The major variables investigated were the breach configuration (i.e., type, orientation, and location) and the gas mass flow rate. The results showed that near the breach, aerosol retention is low (< 20%), and it generally decreases when the gas mass flow rate increases. Discussion of the experimental results suggested that certain phenomena, such as fragmentation and/or resuspension, as well as particle nature could have a large effect on the scenario studied, and they should be considered as potential issues and/or variables to be explored in future work.

The method for determining the chemical elements to be separated is based on the thermal performance of the repository. The important chemical elements are identified, the order of importance of the separated elements is established, and the relationship between the efficiency of the chemical separation and the resulting increase in utilization is determined. The proposed repository at Yucca Mountain is used as an example of a geologic repository for the purposes of illustrating the magnitude of the bene fits that are possible and the implications for repository size and operation. This work is being done in support of the U.S. Department of Energy Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative, where numerous reactor, processing, and recycling strategies are being examined to determine the impact on issues important to the viability of nuclear electricity generation, including the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste.

The RCF core consists of excess Special Power Excursion Reactor Test fuel pins enriched to 4.81 wt% U-235 and clad in stainless steel. An experimental apparatus Was constructed to hold various arrangements of fuel pin lattices. The arrangements consisted of a single activated source pin taken from the reactor core surrounded by inactive fuel pins in an air medium. A sodium-iodide defector and gamma-ray spectroscopy system was used to generate a pulse-height spectrum. of the gamma-ray radiation for detector positions outside the lattice. The change in radiation intensity as the detector is rotated about the vertical axis of the lattice, the "channeling effect," was measured. Measurements of the channeling effect were performed for six experimental arrangements: 3 X 3, 5 X 5, and 7 X 7 lattices, with both the corner and the center positions containing the activated pin. The results of the measurements demonstrate that the gamma-ray radiation intensity can vary widely as a function of angle relative to the angle of rotation about the vertical axis of the lattice.

J	Ahmad, F; Shousha, HA; Diab, HM				Ahmad, F; Shousha, HA; Diab, HM			Comparative study of natural radioactivity concentrations in soil samples from the newly developed Tushki and Giza Regions in Egypt	RADIATION EFFECTS AND DEFECTS IN SOLIDS			English	Article						gamma spectroscopy; radionuclides in soil; uranium; thorium; potassium		Natural radioactive materials under certain conditions can reach hazardous radiological levels. So, it was felt necessary to study the natural radioactivity in soil to assess the dose to the population in order to know the health risks and to have a baseline for future changes in the environmental radioactivity due to human activities. The natural radionuclide (238 U, 232 Th, and 40 K) contents were determined for 21 locations over the whole Giza area and Tushki area using gamma-spectrometric analysis. Estimates of the measured radionuclide content have been made for calculating the absorbed dose rate of gamma radiation. The absorbed dose rates resulting from those concentrations ranged from 5.35 0.54 to 53.95 1.61 nGy h(-1) for major Giza and 34.21 2.76 to 103355.69 927.14 nGy h -1 for the Tushki area. The radium equivalent (R eq) and the external hazard index (H ex), which resulted from the natural radionuclides in soil, are also calculated and tabulated. The radium equivalent was from 11.47 1.15 to 113.25 3.53 Bq kg(-1) and 73.38 5.92 to 223331.64 2008.2 Bq kg(-1) for the major Giza and Tushki areas, respectively. The assessment of natural radioactivity reveals a high background radiation in the north Tushki region, which fortunately is distant from the habitant and cultivated regions. The results of this study can be used as a data baseline for preparing a radiological map of the Tushki area, especially at the chosen settlement sites.

For the investigation of radioactivity in barren and cultivated soil, an area of about 80ha of saline soil was selected in Pakka Anna near the city of Faisalabad in the Punjab province of Pakistan. Activity concentration levels due to K-40, Cs-137, Ra-226 and Th-232 were measured with HPGe detector in 250 saline soil samples collected at a spacing of about 8 ha at a depth of 0-25 cm with intervals of 5 cm depth. Activity concentration ranges of the concerned radionuclides for both of the soils were as follows: 40K. for barren and cultivated saline soil was 499-604 and 563-629 Bq kg(-1), respectively; Cs-137, 3.57-3.63 and 1.98-5.15 Bq kg(-1); Ra-226, 24-29 and 27-33 Bq kg(-1), and Th-232, 49-54 and 46-621 Bq kg(-1). Gamma dose was estimated using the activity to dose rate conversion factors. The measured activity concentrations and the estimated radiation dose were found to be lying within the range specified in the 2000 report of UNSCEAR. Chemical analysis for Na, Ca and Mg was also carried out along with the measurement of electrical conductivity and pH of soil samples. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
