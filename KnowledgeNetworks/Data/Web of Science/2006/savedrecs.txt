Comparison of tests with 14-MeV neutrons to a Monte Carlo model for interrogation of thick cargos for clandestine fissionable materials	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						cargo screening; active interrogation; neutron source; fission product gamma radiation	RAYS FOLLOWING FISSION	A Monte Carlo model has been developed for interrogation of fissionable material embedded in thick cargos when high-energy beta-delayed gamma-rays are detected following neutron-induced fission. The model includes the principal structural components of the laboratory, the neutron source and collimator assembly in which it resides, the assembly that represents cargo of given characteristics, a target of highly enriched uranium (HEU) and large external plastic sciritillators for photon detection. The ability of this model to reproduce experimental measurements was tested by comparing simulations with measurements of the number of induced fissions and the number of detected photons when the HEU target was irradiated with 14.25-MeV neutrons in the absence of any cargo and while embedded in assemblies of plywood and iron pipes. The simulations agreed with experimental measurements within a factor of about 2 for irradiation of the bare target and when the areal density of intervening cargo was 33 g cm(-2) (wood) and 61 gcm(-2) (steel pipes). This suggests that the model can permit exploration of a large range in parameter space with reasonable fidelity. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A probabilistic derivation of gamma-ray attenuation and application: Bayesian mass estimation with a low count spectrum	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Bayesian; mass estimation; gamma-ray attenuation		This paper presents an intuitive derivation of the source and absorber factors in a slab geometry formulation of gamma-ray emissions incident on a detector. Using the attenuation equations, an application to mass estimation from a passively observed, low count spectrum is developed for sources with gamma-ray emissions. Propagation of error provides a confidence interval on the mass estimate. The developed methods are applied to experimental spectra from a known mass of plutonium 239 oxide. The proposed estimation method has potential in national security applications where the geometry of attenuation materials is unknown and there are time constraints on the acquisition of a spectrum. In these application settings, the first-order mass estimate developed in this paper is sufficiently accurate. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Porous silicon samples, having areas of different shape and size, can be made and loaded with a radioactive material, obtaining: (a) precise radio-emitting figures corresponding to the porous areas geometry, (b) a radioactivity of each figure depending on the pore's specifications, and (c) the same emission energy to be used in true exams. To this aim a sample with porous circular areas has been made and loaded with a (TcO4-)-Tc-99m solution. Imaging has been obtained using both general purpose and pinhole collimators. This first sample shows some defects that are analyzed and discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Tc-99-WBC (White Blood Cell) scintigraphy plays a key role ill the diagnosis of bone infections. Spatial resolution of Anger camera is not always able to differentiate soft tissue from bone infection. Aim of present study is to verify if HRD (High-Resolution Detector) is able to improve diagnosis and to help surgery. Patients were studied by HRD showing 25.7 x 25.7 mm(2) FOV, 2 mm spatial resolution and 18% energy resolution. The patients were underwent to surgery and, when necessary, bone biopsy, both guided by HRD. Four patients were positive at Anger camera without specific signs of osteomyelitis. HRS (High-Resolution Scintigraphy) showed hot spots in the same patients. In two of them the hot spot was bar-shaped and it was localized in correspondence of the small phalanx. The presence of bone infection was confirmed at surgery, which was successfully guided by HRS. Tc-99-WBC HRS was able to diagnose pedal infection and to guide the surgery of diabetic foot, opening a new way in the treatment of infected diabetic foot. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For most PET scanners, the calculation of the SM requires extremely long simulation times due to the large number of image voxels, even when considering symmetries. Our goal is to determine in advance which simplifications can be done to accelerate the MC simulation without jeopardizing the accuracy of the SM. Our small animal scanner prototype was simulated using GATE. It consists of a continuous LSO crystal (42 x 42 x 10 mm 3) attached to Flat Panel position sensitive photomultipliers. We investigated three different radioactivity distribution models to compute the SM elements for five representative voxel positions. The results show that the simulation time required to compute the whole SM and the accuracy of the SM depend on the model and on the voxel position. In the inner region of the field of view (FOV), the model with eight point sources distributed within each voxel yields the best trade-off between simulation time and SM accuracy. Whereas, for the peripheral region of the FOV, the model with one emission point at the center of the voxel yields the best compromise. The analysis was carried out with and without having depth-of-interaction (DOI) into account. The effect of the distribution model is more significant when DOI is considered. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Red blood cells labeled with technetium-99m (Tc-99m-RBC) are used as a radiopharmaceutical in several evaluations. The radiolabeling efficiency and bioavailability of radiopharmaceuticals can be altered by natural/synthetic drugs and may induce pitfalls in the analysis of the nuclear medicine imaging. The labeling with Tc-99m requires a reducing agent and stannous chloride (SnCl2) is widely utilized. However, SnCl2 presents a citotoxic and/or genotoxic potential in Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains. The aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of aqueous extracts of Baccharis genistelloides (BG), Terminalia chebula (TC), Mavtenus ilicifolia (MI), Cassia angustifolia (CA) and Equisetum aruense (EA) on (i) radiolabeling of blood constituents, (ii) bioavailability of sodium pertechnetate((NaTcO4)-Tc-99m) radiopharmacetltical, (iii) survival of E coli. In vitro labeling of RBC was performed with blood (Wistar rats) incubated with each extract, SnCl2 and (NaTcO4)-Tc-99m. Plasma (P) and blood cells (BC) were isolated, another aliquots precipitated and soluble (SF) and insoluble (IF) fractions isolated and counted. In the bioavailability of (NaTcO4)-Tc-99m, Wistar rats were treated (7 days) with aqueous extract or with 0.9%NaCl, the radiopharmaceutical was administered, the animals sacrificed, the organs isolated, weighted and radioactivity counted. To evaluate the effect on the bacterial survival, E. coli was treated with: (a) SnCl2; (b) 0.9% NaCl; (c) vegetal extract; or (d) SnCl2 and vegetal extract. Radiolabeling efficiency showed a significantly decrease (ANOVA/Tukey post-test, p < 0.05) after treatment with BG, TC, MI and CA extracts. The bioavailability results showed that the uptake of (NaTcO4)-Tc-99m was altered significantly (unpaired t-student test, p < 0.05) in blood, lungs (CA/TC extracts), bone, heart, ovary (EA/TC), spleen, kidney (TC), pancreas, thyroid (CA) and liver (all the extracts). The alterations promoted by TC extract could be related to cardiotonic, antidiabetes and renal toxicity. The alteration in liver in EA and CA extracts could be related to its hepatoprotective activities. The extracts (EA, MI, BG) were not capable to interfere in the survival of E. coli. Moreover, these extracts have protected the E. coli against the SnCl2 action and this fact can be related to the free radical scavenging properties of the chemical compounds of the extracts. In conclusion these findings could be worthwhile to try to understand and to avoid some pitfalls in the nuclear medicine. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A new method for the labelling of proteins with radioactive arsenic isotopes	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Imaging Technologies in Biomedical Sciences	SEP 25-29, 2005	Milos, GREECE			protein labelling; labelled antibodies; radioactive arsenic	ACUTE PROMYELOCYTIC LEUKEMIA; MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; TRIOXIDE AS2O3; LOCALIZATION; DEGRADATION; GERMANIUM; APOPTOSIS	Radioarsenic labelled radiopharmaceuticals could be a valuable asset to positron emission tomography. In particular, the long half-lives of As-72 (T-1/2 = 26 h) and As-74 (T-1/2 = 17.8 d) allow to investigate slow physiological or metabolical processes, like the enrichment and distribution of monoclonal antibodies (mab) in tumour tissue. In this work, a new method for the labelling of proteins with various radioactive arsenic isotopes was developed. For this purpose, two proteins, namely a chimeric IgG(3) monoclonal antibody, ch3G4, directed against anionic phospholipids, and Rituxan (Rituximab), were labelled as a proof of principle with no-carrier-added radioarsenic isotopes (As-74 and As-77). The developed labelling chemistry gives high yields (> 99.9%), is reliable and could easily be transferred to automated labelling systems in a clinical environment. At least for the mab used in this work, this route of radioarsenic labelling does not affect the immunoreactivity of the product. The arsenic label stays stable for up to 72 h at the molecular mass of the monoclonal antibody, which is in particular relevant to follow the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the labelled mab for several days.

Bombesin receptors and transplanted stem cells in rat brain: High-resolution scan with Tc-99m BN1.1	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Imaging Technologies in Biomedical Sciences	SEP 25-29, 2005	Milos, GREECE			nuclear medicine imaging; small animal imaging; rat brain; radiopharmaceuticals	IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION; ORDERED SUBSETS; GAMMA-CAMERA; IN-VIVO; CANCER; PEPTIDE; PROBE	The aim of this work is to detect the presence of transplanted stem cells (TSC) in rat brain with high-resolution (HR) scintigraphy and labelled bombesin (BN). BN is a morphogen for Central Nervous System (CNS) as well as for other organs: CNS-oriented TSC over-express BN Receptors (BNR). BN is also a neurotransmitter and modulates several functions of CNS. Tc-99m labelled BN-like peptide scan of CNS is the ideal method to detect growing TSC once knowing normal distribution of BNRs in CNS. HR Planar and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) images of rat brain were performed with new HR detectors (Li-tech, Italy). Pertechnetate, Tc-99m HMPAO and the new Tc-99m BN1.1 (patented) were i.v. administered in five rats. HR SPECT of Tc-99m BN1.1 detected olfactory tract, fronto-lateral cortex, cerebellum, basal ganglia and amygdale. Results of SPECT were confirmed by biodistribution study performed after autopsy of three of the five rats. The remaining two rats underwent cerebral lesions followed by transplant of TSC. Three months later, HR scintigraphy was repeated and showed images completely different from previous basal study, with hot spot of Tc-99m BN1.1 corresponding to the site of TSC transplant. Immuno-histochemistry confirmed the presence of viable TSC. Not only Tc-99m BN1.1 HR scan showed viability of transplanted TSC but also the "background brain" was the still now unknown map of BNR in mammalian brain. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: The DTPA/PEG-liposomes were synthesized with a medium size of 110 nm, conjugated with In-111/Lu-177-(oxine)(3) to afford In-111/Lu-177-liposome. The stability of In-111/Lu-177-liposome in serum was investigated. The biodistribution, scintigraphic imaging and pharmacokinetics of In-111/Lu-177-liposomes after intravenous(i.v.) injection into C-26 tumor-bearing BALB/cByJ mice were studied. Radiation dose was estimated by MIRD-III program. Results: The incorporation efficiency of In-111/Lu-177 into liposomes was 95%. After incubation at 37 degrees C for 72h in serum, more than 83% of radioactivity was still retained in the intact In-111/Lu-177-liposomes. The biodistribution of In-111-liposomes showed that the radioactivity in the blood decreased from 23.14 +/- 8.16%ID/g at 1 h to 0.02 +/- 0.00% ID/g at 72h post-injection (p.i.), while reaching its maximum accumulation in tumors at 48 h p.i., with half-life in blood of 10.2 h. The results were supported by that of Lu-177-liposomes. Scintigraphic imaging with In-111-liposomes showed unambiguous tumor images at 48 It p.i. Dose estimation showed that the absorbed dose in tumor from Lu-177-fposornes was 5.74 x 10(-5) Gy/MBq. Conclusions: This study provides an in vivo characterization and dosimetric evaluation for the use of liposome systems as carriers in targeted radionuclide therapy. The results suggest that adequate tumor targeting as well as dose delivered to tumors could be achieved by the use of radionuclide targeted liposomes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: In vitro release profile of IUdR from IUdR/LP to serum was performed. IUdR/LP was injected into N1-S1 hepatoma-bearing SD rat via hepatic artery and IUdR/normal saline (IUdR/NS) was used for comparison. Biodistribution, autoradiography, imaging and tumor DNA incorporation assay were performed. The radioactive metabolites in plasma and urine were analyzed. Radiation doses to tumor and organs were estimated. Results: IUdR released from lipiodol into serum was fast. There were longer retention, more DNA incorporation and higher radiation dose of IUdR in the tumor by using IUdR/LP. IUdR/LP deposited deep in the hepatomas. Only free iodide was found in the plasma and urine after injection of IUdR/LP. Conclusions: Hepatic artery injection of IUdR/LP emulsion could definitely enhance the tumor cell uptake and incorporation to DNA of *IUdR, prolong the tumor retention time and increase radiation dose to tumor. IUdR/LP may be an effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of hepatic tumors. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

They presented a maximum sorption capacity of 2.179 and 1.517 meq of I-131(-)/g of hydrotalcite respectively. When the hydrotalcites were calcined and rehydrated in a solution. iodine sorption decreased in both samples to 1.515 and 1.446, respectively. The corresponding value for nitrated hydrotalcite which was prepared by the conventional method for comparison purposes, was 0.570. The radionuclide content in hydrotalcites was determined by gamma-spectrometry. I-131(-) sorption is dependent on two main parameters: one is the type of the interlayer organic material and the second the surface area. It was found that hydrotalcites prepared with ethoxide-acetylacetonate were better sorbents for I-131(-) than those with acetylacetonate. Still, if the specific surface area increased, I-131(-) sorption Increased as well; nitrated HT resulted in low specific surface area and a low sorption capacity. It is, therefore. concluded that organic residues present in the samples prepared by the microwave method favor the sorption of radioactive anions. in particular I-131(-) if compared with nitrated and/or carbonate interlayered hydrotalcites.

Cementation of ILW ion exchange resins: Impact of sulfate ions released by radiolysis on hydrated matrix	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							DELAYED ETTRINGITE FORMATION; WATER-ADSORPTION; EXPANSION	Some of the ion exchange resins used during treatment of spent nuclear fuels are intermediate level radioactive wastes which may be damaged by radiolysis process, releasing sulfate ions directly into the cement-based encapsulating material. This work consists in an experimental study of the resulting sulfate attack on the properties of the hydrated matrix: dimensional stability, mineralogy and microstructure of the samples, as well as variations in the chemical composition of the curing solution, were studied during six months. Three sites of delayed ettringite formation were detected: into the cement matrix near the surface exposed to solution, localized in the interfacial transition zone between cement matrix and resins, or progressively replacing the portlandite that initially fulfilled the cracks of anionic resins. During the experiment period, the ettringite precipitation and the expansion detected were moderate, and did not lead to cracking. The material involved was considered as having a good resistance to sulfate attack. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Simulations of heat and oxygen diffusion in UO2 nuclear fuel rods	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							OPERATING DEFECTIVE FUEL; MIXED-OXIDE FUEL; THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; HYPERSTOICHIOMETRIC URANIA; TRANSPORT PROCESSES; SOLID-SOLUTIONS; RECOMMENDATIONS; OXIDATION	We present finite-element simulations of coupled heat and oxygen atom diffusion for UO2 fuel pellets. The expressions for thermal conductivity, specific heat and oxygen diffusivity for the fuel element are obtained directly from previously published correlations, or from analysis of previously published data. We examine the temperature and non-stoichiometry distributions for a varying range of conditions. Simulations are performed for steady-state and transient regime in one-dimensional (purely radial) configurations. For steady-state conditions we perform parametric studies that determine the maximum temperature in the fuel rod as a function of non-stoichiometry and heat generation rate intensity. For transient simulations, we examine the time lag in the response of the temperature and non-stoichiometry distributions with respect to sudden changes in heat generation rate intensity and oxygen removal rate. All simulations are performed with the commercial code COMSOL Multiphysics (TM). (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Reversible expansion of gallium-stabilized delta-plutonium	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							PU-GA ALLOYS; PHASE-TRANSFORMATIONS; IRRADIATION; SYSTEM	It is shown that the transient expansion of plutonium-gallium alloys observed both in the lattice parairieter as well as in the dimension of a sample held at ambient temperature cart be explained by assuming incipient precipitation or Pu3Ga. However, this ordered zeta(')-phase is also subject to radiation-induced disordering. As a result, the gallium-stabilized delta-phase, being metastable at ambient temperature. is driven towards thermodynamic equilibrium by radiation-enhanced diffusion of gallium and at the same time reverted back to its metastable state by radiation-induced disordering. A steady state is reached in which only a modest fraction of the gallium present is arranged in ordered zeta(')-phase regions. Published by Elsevier BN.

The studied sample was cut from a bumper limiter exposed in the TEXTOR tokamak and annealed by a 1 J Excimer laser (KrF). The energy used was 400 mJ cm(-2), which is below the threshold for ablation. 1 J cm(-2). The release of HD and D, was measured by a mass spectroscopy set-up and no other species released from the sample were detected in this experiment. The amount of D released from the sample after 20 laser pulses was measured to 7 x 10(16) D atoms per cm(-2) (for this particular sample) and most of the hydrogen at the surface was released in the first pulse, as checked by nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) techniques, which gave changes of the amount of deuterium before and after laser annealing. The sensitivity in this experiment was 5 x 10(14) atoms per cm(-2) for HD and 5 x 10(13) atoms per cm(-2) for D-2. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The laser-Compton scattering gamma ray generation was tested on a synchrotron radiation facility, "NewSUBARU" at Lasti/UH. Cw Nd:YVO laser (wavelength: 1.064 mu m, maximum power: 5 W) was used in the experiments. Maximum energies of scattered gamma ray are 17.6 and 39.1 MeV at the operating electron energy of I and 1.5 GeV, respectively. Generated gamma-ray was measured and used in the shielding tunnel of 45 cm thickness concrete wall. A scintillation detector (NaI) and Ge detector were used to measure the gamma-ray spectrum and the yield. A measured gamma-ray yield of 5 x 10(3) photons/s/mA/W is in agreement with calculation. A spatial distribution of gamma-ray and its dependence on a polarization of incident laser were measured using imaging plate (IP). Preliminary experiments of gamma-ray application were performed for a nuclear transmutation in the disposal of the radioactive nuclear waste and on a gamma-ray radiography for nondestructive testing of a thick subject. New radiation shielding for the gamma-ray beamline was designed for extracting the higher flux gamma-rays for application. Radiation leakage was calculated by EGS4 and MCNPX. The calculations of neutron transport are important for observation of fast neutron generated from a target sample irradiated by gamma-ray beam. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Its prime fields of research are the exploration of hot and dense nuclear matter, studies of the gluon spin composition of the nucleon, and investigations of parton structures in nuclei. The experiment is being upgraded with a silicon vertex detector that will substantially enhance the physics capabilities of its central arm spectrometers. The silicon vertex detector consists of a four-layer barrel, built from two internal layers of pixel detectors and two external layers of projective "strip-pixel" detectors which complement the central electron spectrometer arms of PHENIX. In this paper, the physics motivation of the upgrade and the concept of the new detector are outlined. The status of new developments and the beginning production of the silicon detectors are presented. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the present work, an attempt has been made to produce some of those radioisotopes by irradiating a natural Ge-target material with heavy-ion oxygen (O-16(+6)) projectiles. An effective radiochemical separation scheme was developed to isolate Y, Sr and Rb radiotracers from the irradiated Ge-matrix in no-carrier-added form with a view to applying those radiotracers for standardization of a technique for the radiochemical separation of Y from natural Sr target. The standardized separation technique could be utilized for the production of the positron-emitting Y-86 from an enriched Sr-86 target irradiated at a medical cyclotron. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Vejsada, J				Vejsada, Jan			The uncertainties associated with the application of batch technique for distribution coefficients determination - A case study of cesium adsorption on four different bentonites	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						adsorption; batch technique; cesium; clays; K(d); uncertainties	SOCIETY SOURCE CLAYS; SMECTITE-RICH CLAYS; BASE-LINE; MINERALS; SORPTION; ELEMENTS; KINETICS; ILLITE; ION	The uncertainties associated with the batch method used often as adsorption data source for performance assessments of radioactive waste repositories have been analyzed and evaluated. The adsorption of cesium on four different bentonites (two Na- and two Ca-bentonites) using a radiotracer ((137)Cs) technique has been studied to evaluate experimental uncertainties and compare their effects on calculated distribution coefficients (K(d)s). Three main factors influencing uncertainty of K(d) at given conditions were identified-the radiotracer operation (mainly tracer addition to experimental systems), the phase separations efficiency and the mineralogical heterogeneity of samples. It was found that the determination of quantitative contributions of the last two factors to the uncertainty of K(d) is difficult, depending on input material and conditions. The centrifugation and ultrafiltration method has been tested for removing colloids in sample solutions, but the results obtained were disputable. The mineral heterogeneity (complex mineral composition) effect has been identified mainly in kinetics of cesium adsorption where three different trends were described. This has important influence on the time-scale of the experiment's planning and equilibrium time estimation or identification. It has been concluded that experimental procedure may represent important uncertainty source of calculated K(d).

A facile method for post-conjugation prosthetic radioiodination of "mini-peptides"	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						prosthetic radioiodination; peptides; post-conjugation	SOMATOSTATIN RECEPTOR; BINDING; PROTEINS; REAGENTS; ACID	Prosthetic radioiodination methods were developed to facilitate the labeling of proteins devoid of tyrosine(s) or when these moieties are crucial for biological activity. This method involves the use of the so-called Bolton-Hunter-type reagents. However, the in vivo instability of the label prompted the search for more stable groups. Although these second generation reagents have worked well with proteins and peptides, the current reaction scheme takes a long time to perform. A simplified method may be more appropriate especially from radiation safety point of view. More importantly, for short-lived halogens, advantage may be gained utilizing a shorter reaction time. Recently we reported on the radioiodination of interleukin-8 (IL-8) using the pyridine carboxylate-derived activated ester. We have successfully conjugated this prosthetic group to tri- and tetrapeptides harboring the somatostatin (SST) receptor recognition units and characterized by HPLC and MS. The radioiodination was accomplished using the Iodogen method in a reasonable yield (mean = 60%). The total synthesis time was approximately 60 min, which was 3-4 times shorter than the classical two-step method. Preliminary biodistribution of the radiolabeled peptide showed uptake in some of the organs known to express SST receptors. Injection of a low specific activity tracer significantly decreased the retention of radioactivity in these organs. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The intensities at such facilities are principally limited by decay losses associated with times required for diffusion-release from target materials and transport from the target to the ion source and by the maximum permissible primary beam power depositional density that can be tolerated without deleteriously affecting target integrity or ion source efficiency. Consequently, it is imperative to minimize delay times associated with the independent diffusion and effusive-flow processes by choosing small dimensioned (short-diffusion length) highly refractory target materials and formatting them in highly permeable mechanically and thermally robust structures that can withstand high-power beam irradiation for extended periods of time. This article provides basic information on methods, procedures and principles for selecting target materials; for designing fast diffusion-release targets; for designing fast effusive-flow vapor transport systems; and introduces methods for controlling target temperatures as required for optimizing intensities of short-lived radioactive ion beams at ISOL based research facilities.

The calculations were performed for a stationary load of the core with a four-year fuel run. The difference between the neutron-physical characteristics of a core with a full load of uranium and reprocessed uranium-plutonium fuel is discussed.

Use of plutonium: Forty years of MOX use in German nuclear power plants	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								Plutonium separated in spent fuel reprocessing has always been an object of considerable controversy in which facts tended to play a subordinate role. Typical headlines in the press run like this: "What to Do with 50 t of Plutonium" or "Plutonium Problem Baffles Experts." The necessary public attention regularly is secured by terms such as "ultratoxic" or "weapon-grade" in media reporting. After the change in government in 1998, the use of plutonium was termed an unsolved "burden left by previous governments." A seminar was run by the Federal Ministry for the Environment in 2000 in an effort to find repository solutions for plutonium although the perspectives of using that material were in no way inferior to those prevailing today. This erroneous impression of the utilization of plutonium being an open issue will be corrected in this article on the occasion of the 40(th) anniversary of the first use of mixed oxide fuel on German nuclear power plants. In 1966, the Kahl Experimental Nuclear Power Station for the first time employed plutonium as a mixed oxide fuel (MOX). This anniversary offers an opportunity for outlining the political framework of the separation and use of plutonium, and sketching the development of MOX fuel fabrication and use. In addition, the perspectives will be shown for plutonium not yet processed, and the contribution to electricity generation arising from the use of MOX fuel will be described.

J	Haverkamp, B; Biurrun, E				Haverkamp, B.; Biurrun, E.			Closure of the Richard underground repository for low and intermediate level radioactive waste - Application of the hydraulic cage concept	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article								In 2003, the Czech Radioactive Waste Repository Authority (RAWRA) launched a Phare project aimed at reducing burden from past practices during the first phase of the Richard repository operation and at improving its overall long term safety. The contract for this project was awarded to DBE TECHNOLOGY GmbH. When reviewing the preliminary closure concept and the related safety assessment prepared by RAWRA, it became clear that the existing concept had deficits in regard to potential radiological exposure after closure of the repository. To remediate such hazards, DBE TECHNOLOGY GmbH developed a new concept for the closure of individual waste chambers. The main technological element of this concept is the installation of an additional engineered barrier called hydraulic cage around the waste chambers. This cage prevents the development of advective flow through the waste/concrete body within the backfilled chambers and thereby advective transport of radionuclides. An important advantage of the new closure concept is the fact that the safety against potential radiological impact originating From waste inside a closed chamber is achieved directly and does not rely on any additional measures connected with the future closure of the repository as a whole. After consulting the competent Czech authorities RAWRA decided to follow the hydraulic cage concept for the planned realization of the closure of a certain chamber system within the mine. During further execution of the project a detailed plan for this closure work was elaborated to a degree of detail, which allowed its direct technical realization, which started at the beginning of 2006. By October 2006, the first segment of the chamber-system was successfully backfilled, leading to a significant improvement of the operational and long-term safety of the repository.

Estimation of health risks associated with occupational radiation exposure: Addressing measurement error and minimum detectable exposure level	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						analysis; risk; analysis; statistical; biostatistics; dosimetry; errors	URANIUM PROCESSING WORKERS; OAK-RIDGE; EXTERNAL RADIATION; IONIZING-RADIATION; MORTALITY; CANCER; COHORT	Occupational exposures are subject to several types of measurement errors. This paper considers two of the most common types of measurement error associated with occupational exposures: the error due to below minimum detection level and doses due to random measurement error. Doses are often recorded as zero when the exposure is below the minimum detection level. Values that are below the minimum detection level and are entered as zero lead to underestimation of the true exposure and can result in either an overestimate or underestimate of risk associated with the exposure. Random measurement error leads to an inefficient and attenuated estimate of risk associated with exposure. However, the levels of bias and inefficiency that can result from the simultaneous presence of both types of measurement error have not previously been studied. In addition, the impact of these measurement errors on the type I error and type II error for an exposure-response effect is unclear. Since the magnitude of the random error associated with cumulative exposure may vary with individuals and across time within an individual, traditional methods to correct for random measurement errors are not applicable here. Further, correcting errors for minimum detectable levels and random errors simultaneously is too complex for analytical solutions. Therefore, this paper uses simulation studies to quantitatively evaluate the magnitude of the bias, inefficiency, and type I and type II errors associated with them. The simulation results are applied to a sample of historical occupational radiation exposure data from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. We conclude that after taking into consideration random measurement error and missed doses due to falling below the minimum detection level, radiation exposure is not significantly associated with all-cause mortality in that cohort.

The Rn-222 air concentrations in the cave vary between a minimum of 383.6 Bq m(-3) and a maximum of 2,015.7 Bq m(-3), with an annual average of 1,100.4 Bq m(-3). Distinct seasonal variation of radon air concentrations inside the cave was observed. The maximum average radon concentration occurred in summer and the minimum average radon concentration occurred in winter. The annual effective dose to tour guides varies between an average of 1.2 mSv and 4.9 mSv depending on different equilibrium factors together with different dose conversion factors proposed in the literature, which is lower than the international recommendations. In all cases, the annual effective doses to visitors are well under the 1 mSv maximum suggested dose for a member of the public for one year.

A new proposal for monitoring patients in nuclear medicine	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						I-131; monitoring; personnel; nuclear medicine; radiation therapy	RADIATION-EXPOSURE; THERAPY	The measurement of exposure rates is fundamentally important in the release of patients given radioactive materials and for keeping the exposures of others as low as reasonable achievable. Similar measurement methodologies have generally been used for point and extended sources, but this approach may lead to methodological errors in calculating radiation dose estimates. In this study, nuclear medicine patients who received high activities of (NaI)-I-131 for therapy were monitored using different measurement methodologies, and the results showed that the usual measurement performed at 1.0 m in front of the body resulted in a mean error of 40% between experimental and theoretical exposure rates. The best measurements were obtained when performed at 2.0 m in front of the patients. With this approach, the error was about 2% between experimental and theoretical values. These findings suggest a new methodology for patients' measurement in nuclear medicine and could be useful for personal monitoring in cases of radiological emergencies involving I-131 ingestion.

The 18 reviewers might not be aware of the new achievement in the Advanced Technology Research Center, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries; hence, their conclusion should have been more positive towards this research. Arata's DS-reactor, NASA's early experiment, and the "heat after death" experiment should change the conclusion about the "excess heat" and its prospect. Various fundamental researches have shown the consistent nature in understanding. A cost effective and comprehensive study is mentioned.

The blanket configuration of the FDT is improved by analyzing various sample blanket design combinations with different radial thicknesses. Two different transmutation zones (TZ(MA) and TZ(FP) which contain the MA and LLFP nuclides, respectively) are located separately from each other. The volume fractions of the MA and the LLFP are raised from 10 to 20% stepped by 2% and from 10 to 80% stepped by 5%, respectively. The calculations are performed to estimate neutronic parameters and transmutation characteristics per D-T fusion neutron. The conversion ratios (CRs) for the whole of all MAs are about 65-70%. The transmutation rates of the LLFP nuclides increase linearly with the increase of volume fractions of the MA, and the Tc-99 nuclide among them has the highest transmutation rate. The variations of their transmutation rate per unit volume in the radial direction are quasi-concave parabolic.

J	Nielsen, F; Jonsson, M				Nielsen, Fredrik; Jonsson, Mats			Geometrical alpha- and beta-dose distributions and production rates of radiolysis products in water in contact with spent nuclear fuel	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							DISSOLUTION; OXIDATION; CORROSION; UO2	A mathematical model for the dose distribution and production rates of radiolysis products in water surrounding spent nuclear fuel has been developed, based on the geometrical and energetic properties of radiation. The nuclear fuel particle is divided into layers, from which the radiation emits. The water is likewise divided into layers, where the doses are distributed. The doses are stored in vectors which are added to determine the total dose rate. A complete inventory with over 200 radionuclides has been used as input data for the model. The purpose of the model is to describe the geometrical dose distribution as a function of fuel age and burn-up, to be used as input data for kinetic modeling of the fuel dissolution. The results show that the P-dose contribution close to the spent fuel surface is negligible. Also, the variation in the relative OC/P dose contribution between different ages and burn-ups is insignificant. The alpha- and beta-dose rates vary between different burn-ups of the same age; the younger the fuel is, the larger is the difference. Exponential functions have been fitted to the relations between fuel age and average dose rate, giving useful expressions for determining average dose rates for fuel ages other than those covered in this work.

Effect of post-D+-irradiation time delay and pre-TDS heating on D retention in single crystal tungsten	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							DEUTERIUM RETENTION; LOW-ENERGY; POLYCRYSTALLINE TUNGSTEN; IMPLANTED DEUTERIUM; BLISTER FORMATION; FUSION-REACTORS; PLASMA; DAMAGE; IONS	Deuterium retention measurements using thermal desorption spectroscopy were made for single crystal tungsten (SCW) irradiated with D+ to a fluence of 1 X 10(23) D/m(2) at room temperature following various experimental procedures. The dominant desorption peaks in the TDS spectra were at similar to 400 K and similar to 600 K, with a peak at similar to 500 K also present in some cases. The primary findings were (i) D retention was found to decrease by as much as a factor of 2 with increasing the time delay between D+ irradiation and TDS from < 1 h to > 8 weeks, indicating the presence of some mobile D in the bulk introduced during irradiation, which could diffuse and escape even at room temperature. (ii) Mild baking of the test chamber to similar to 360 K between D+ irradiation and TDS resulted in the escape of similar to 40% of the trapped deuterium, indicating that additional lower energy traps exist. (iii) Background gas impurities lead to impurity implantation in the near surface of the specimen, which in turn leads to increased trapping of D. However, the effect of impurities on D retention was relatively smaller (about 10-20%) than the effects of mild baking and post-implantation time delay. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Preparation of (U,PU)O-2 pellets through sol-gel microsphere pelletization technique	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							UO2-PUO2 PELLETS; FUEL PELLETS; FABRICATION; UO2; PARAMETERS; URANIUM	Mixed uranium-plutonium oxide microspheres were prepared by internal gelation process using feed solution of optimized composition. in the feed, total metal concentration was maintained at 1.5 M and hexamethylenctetramine (HMTA)urea to metal mole ratio (R) was kept at 1.0. The gel particles obtained from each batch were dried and heated at 250 degrees C in air and then calcined in O-2 at 800 degrees C followed by reduction in 8%H-2/92%N-2 at 600 degrees C for 1 h to obtain soft (U,PU)O-2 microspheres containing 4 mol% Pu. The soft (U,PU)O-2 microspheres were directly taken for the preparation of pellets. The microspheres were characterized with respect to surface area, tap density, crush strength and O/M ratio. X-ray diffraction analysis of the mixed oxide microspheres was carried out to identify the phases. The mixed oxide pellets were characterized for their density and micro-homogeneity. The sintering behaviour was studied by dilatometric investigations. The green pellets were sintered in 8%H-2/92%N-2 at 1600 degrees C for 2 h. The density of the sintered pellet was found to be 10.40 +/- 0.05 g/cm(3) with grains in the size range of 3-6 mu m with an excellent micro-homogeneity. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effect of feed solution composition and heat treatment conditions on the morphology of uranium oxide microspheres prepared by sol-gel process	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							PELLETIZATION TECHNIQUE; FUEL PELLETS; UO2 FUEL; FABRICATION; ADSORPTION; CARBON; GASES	Uranium oxide microspheres were prepared by internal gelation process (IGP) using selected feed solution compositions. In the feed, concentration of uranium was maintained at 1.25 M and hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA)-urea to uranium mole ratio (R) was varied between 1.2 and 1.5. The gel particles obtained from each batch were heated at 250 degrees C in air. The samples from each batch were heated under various heat treatment conditions, such as calcination to U(3)O(9), reduction of calcined U(3)O(8) and direct reduction of UO(3) to UO(2). The effect of feed solution composition and heat treatment conditions on the morphology of the uranium oxide microspheres was studied by measuring surface area, pore size distribution, pore volume, tap density and crush strength. The details of open and closed pores on the dried and heat treated products were studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Iizuka, M; Sakamura, Y; Inoue, T				Iizuka, Masatoshi; Sakamura, Yoshiharu; Inoue, Tadashi			Electrochemical reduction of (U-40Pu-5Np)O(2) in molten LiCl electrolyte	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							METAL; DIOXIDE	The electrochemical reduction of neptunium-containing MOX ((U-40Pu-5Np)O(2)) was performed in molten lithium chloride melt at 923 K to investigate fundamental behavior of the transuranium, elements and applicability of the method to reduction process for these materials. The Np-MOX was electrochemically reduced at the potential lower than -0.6 V vs. Bi-35 mol% Li reference electrode. The reduced metal grains in the surface region of the sample cohered with each other and made the layer of relatively high density, although it did not prevent the reduction of the sample toward the center. Complete reduction of the Np-MOX was shown by the weight change measurement through the electrochemical reduction and also by SEM-EDX observation. The chemical composition of the reduction products was homogeneous and agreed to that of the initial Np-MOX, which indicates that the reduction was completed and not selective among the actinides. The concentrations of the actinide elements, especially plutonium and americium in the electrolyte, increased with the progress of the tests, although their absolute values were very small. It is quite likely that plutonium and americium dissolve into the melt in the same manner as the lanthanide elements in the lithium reduction process. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Chemical states of fission products in irradiated (U0.3Pu0.7)C1+x fuel at high burn-ups	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							URANIUM-CARBIDE; NUCLEAR-FUELS; CARBON SYSTEM; OXIDE FUELS; THERMODYNAMICS; EQUILIBRIUM; RHODIUM; OXYGEN; CS	The chemical states of fission products have been theoretically determined for the irradiated carbide fuel of Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR) at Kalpakkam, India, at different burn-ups. The SOLGASMIX-PV computer code was used to determine the equilibrium chemical composition of the fuel. The system was assumed to be composed of a gaseous phase at one atmosphere pressure, and various solid phases. The distribution of elements in these phases and their chemical states at different temperatures were calculated as a function of burn-up. The FBTR fuel, (U0.3Pu0.7)C1+x, was loaded with C/M values in the range, 1.03-1.06. The present calculations indicated that even for the lowest starting C/M of 1.03 in the FBTR fuel, the liquid metal phase of (U, Pu), should not appear at a burn-up as high as 150 GWd/t.

Structural aspects of barium borosilicate glasses containing thorium and uranium oxides	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							SILICATE-GLASSES; REDOX INTERACTIONS; BASE COMPOSITIONS; FORMING MELTS; NUCLEAR WASTE; CHEMISTRY; IMMOBILIZATION; ALUMINOSILICATES; RELEVANT; EXAFS	Barium borosilicate glasses incorporated with 15.86 wt% ThO2 and containing different amounts of uranium oxide were prepared by conventional melt quench method. Based on 29Si and B-11 magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) studies, it has been confirmed that uranium oxide incorporation is associated with distortion of borosilicate network as revealed by the increase in the relative concentration of Q(2) structural units of silicon as well as the increase in the quadrupolar coupling constant (C-q) of BO3 structural units. The increased number of non-bridging oxygen atoms brought about by the increase in Q(2) structural units of silicon facilitates the incorporation of both uranium and thorium ions in the sites created by non-bridging oxygen atoms (network modifying positions) in the glass. Uranium oxide incorporation above 7.5 wt% resulted in the phase separation of ThO2 as revealed by the X-ray diffraction studies. The present study focuses on the structural changes with the borosilicate network of barium borosilicate glasses brought about by the introduction of thorium and uranium ions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

S-RMWR is a technology demonstration reactor which also conducts material and fuel testing for commercial use of Reduced-Moderation Water Reactor (RMWR) in large-scale power plants. It has a very tight triangular fuel rod lattice and a high coolant void fraction. The RMWR core axially has two short and flat uranium plutonium mixed oxide (MOX) regions with an internal blanket region in between, in order to avoid a positive void reactivity coefficient. The MOX regions are sandwiched between upper and lower blanket regions, in order to increase a conversion ratio. In this small reactor core, leakage of neutrons is expected to be larger than in a large core. Therefore, a core design concept different from that for a large core is necessary. Core burnup calculations and nuclear and thermal-hydraulic coupled calculations were per-formed in the present study with SRAC and MOSRA codes. MVP code was also used to obtain control rod worth. Because of its large neutron leakage, keeping the void reactivity coefficient negative is easier for S-RMWR than RMWR. Thus, the heights of MOX region can be taller and the plutonium enrichment can be lower than in RMWR. On the other hand, to achieve the conversion ratio of 1.0, radial blanket and stainless steel reflector assemblies are necessary, whereas they are not needed for RMWR.

DPV measurement of UO22+ in NaCl-2CsCl at 923 K, with a set of optimized parameters (potential sweep rate -0.1 V/s, pulse cycle 0.1 s, pulse width 10 ms and pulse potential height 50 mV), showed a clear current peak at -0.9 V vs. Cl-2/Cl-. This was attributed to the reduction of UO22+ to UO2+. The relation between the current peak height and the analytical concentration of the UO22+ showed good proportionality in the concentration region up to 0.06 mol(.)l(-1), and the applicability of UO22+ concentration measurement by DPV was confirmed up to 0.4 mol(.)l(-1). In order to assess the interference by the coexisting fission product elements to the measurement of UO22+ concentration, DPV measurements of UO22+ concentration in molten NaCl-2CsCl containing PdCl2, NdCl3, SMCl3 and CeCl3 were also performed. Even before removing Pd, the current peak at -0.9V vs. Cl-2/Cl- by the reduction of UO22+ to UO2+ was found to be distinguishable from the reduction currents of Pd2+ to Pd at -0.7V vs. Cl-2/Cl-. As a result, the application of DPV measurement technique to the in-situ monitoring of UO22+ concentration in the oxide electro-winning method requires the improvement of the DPV measuring condition or the electrode structure on higher UO22+ concentration condition.

The objective of this study is to establish the evaluation procedure for predicting the tritium behavior in the 300 MWth Pebble type gas cooled reactor which is the one of the candidate reactors for nuclear hydrogen development and demonstration plant. The tritium generated by the fission reaction can be leaked to the helium coolant from the coated ceramic particles and fuel elements. The annual total release rate of the tritium is estimated as 0.47% from the fuel kernel to the helium coolant by the numerical method. Tritium attributed by Li-6 existing as impurities in the reflector can be released to the helium coolant by the diffusion process and the total annual release rate of the tritium is estimated as 5.3% through the reflector to the helium coolant. Based on the Siverts' law, tritium permeation from the primary coolant to the hydrogen production system is also evaluated and the result is calculated as 76-0.23 Bq/g-H-2 with respect to the PRF (Permeation Reduction Factor=10-1000) in case of the normal operation of the 300 MWth Pebble type reactor.

Physical properties, melting and vaporization are important for the application of the salt and thus they have been investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TG), respectively. Experimental data suggest LiCl and Li(2)O compound formations, leading to a melting point depression of the LiCl and a co-vaporization of the LiCl-Li(2)O salt.

The aim of this study was to develop a method to compare organic substances or their degradation products with respect to what extent they affect metal sorption. Batch sorption studies were performed with cement or TiO2 as solid phase and Eu(III) as a model element for trivalent lanthanides and actinides at pH 12.5 (representative of a cement waste matrix during the first approximately 100,000 years). Different kinds of ligands were studied in a broad concentration range, e.g., organic acids, cement additives, cleaning agents and degradation products from ion-exchange resin.

Distribution of C-14 and H-3 in low level radioactive wastes generated by wet waste streams from pressurized water reactors	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							NUCLEAR-FUEL CYCLE; DISCHARGES	It is impossible to detect C-14 and H-3 by direct methods such as gamma-spectroscopy because they are pure b-emitters and thus they are classified as hard to measure nuclides (HTM). In this paper the analysis results of C-14 and H-3 in the low level radioactive wastes (LLWs), including spent ion exchange resin, evaporated bottom and sludge are presented. The LLWs were generated by three nuclear power plants (NPPs), in Korea all with pressurized water type reactors (PWRs). A simultaneous separation procedure for C-14 and H-3 in LLWs was established by wet oxidation-acid stripping. A liquid scintillation analyzer was used for the measurement of C-14 and H-3. It was found that the recovery of C-14 and H-3 was 82-99 and 78-103%, respectively, by wet oxidation-acid stripping with diluted standard solutions. At the lowest injection of C-14 and H-3, i.e., at 1.44 Bq for C-14 and 1.22 Bq for H-3, the minimum detectable activity (MDA) of C-14 and H-3 was calculated as 0.88 and 0.78 Bq/g, respectively, for the minimum allowable sample weight, using wet oxidation and 16 wt% H2SO4 acid. By the wet oxidation-16 wt% H2SO4 stripping method no interfering nuclides were detected in the trapping solution of (CO2)-C-14 and the distillate of H-3. The activity concentration range of C-14 in the analyzed samples, i.e., spent ion exchange resin, evaporated bottom and sludge, was 0.17-110,000, 8.4-1380 and 0.1-10,006 Bq/g, respectively, and that of H-3 in the same was from no detectable to 769, 134-14,383 and 0.7-4820 Bq/g, respectively.
