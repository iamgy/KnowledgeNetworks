This study was to determine whether the diagnostic accuracy can be improved with Tc-99m-HL91 SPELT in comparison with parallel results of CT imaging. Thirty patients of lung cancer or head & neck cancer, suspected of recurrences on clinical symptoms and CT during clinical follow-up after therapy, underwent Tc-99m-HL91 SPELT. The radioactivity ratios of tumor to normal tissues (TRIM were calculated using the region of interest technique. Results of Tc-99m-HL91 SPELT were verified by histopathology. The Tc-99m-HL91 average uptake ratios of T/NT in the group of recurrent lesions and non-recurrent lesions were 1.58 +/- 0.16 and 1.18 +/- 0.14, respectively. A significant difference was found between T/NT data of the two phases (t=4.87, P<0.001). The 99mTc-HL91 SPELT shows sensitivity of 72.73%, specificity of 89.47% and accuracy of 83.83% for differentiating recurrent lesion, while the CT shows sensitivity of 63.63%, specificity of 84.21% and accuracy of 76.67%. A combination of Tc-99m-HL91 SPELT and CT for 21 patients with lung cancers or head & neck cancers with congruent results shows sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 94.12% and accuracy of 95.23%. It is concluded that Tc-99m-HL91 SPELT may play a role in differentiating recurrent lesions in patients with lung cancer and head & neck cancer. Furthermore, the combination of CT and Tc-99m-HL91 SPELT is a more effective method for diagnosing recurrence of lung cancer and head & neck cancer.

Resta			In-reactor performance of pressure tubes in CANDU reactors	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on the Advances in Nuclear Materials	DEC 12-14, 2006	Bhabha Atom Res Ctr, Bombay, INDIA	Board Res Nucl Sci, Dept Atom Energy	Bhabha Atom Res Ctr		ZR-2.5NB; FRACTURE; IRRADIATION	The pressure tubes in CANDU reactors have been operating for times up to about 25 years. The in-reactor performance of Zr-2.5Nb pressure tubes has been evaluated by sampling and periodic inspection. This paper describes the behaviour and discusses the factors controlling the behaviour of these components in currently operating CANDU reactors. The mechanical properties (such as ultimate tensile strength, UTS, and fracture toughness), and delayed-hydride-cracking properties (crack growth rate V(c), and threshold stress intensity factor, K(IH)) change with irradiation; the former reach a limiting value at a fluence of <1 X 10(25) n m(-2). while V(c) and K(IH) reach a steady-state condition after a fluence of about 3 x 10(25) n m(-2) and 3 X 10(24) n m(-2), respectively. At saturation the UTS is raised by about 200 MPa, toughness is reduced to about 40% of its initial value, V(c) increases by about a factor of ten while K(IH) is only slightly reduced. The role of microstructure and trace elements in these behaviours is described. Pressure tubes exhibit elongation and diametral expansion. The deformation behaviour is a function of operating conditions and material properties that vary from tube-to-tube and as a function of axial location. Semi-empirical predictive models have been developed to describe the deformation response of average tubes as a function of operating conditions. For corrosion and, more importantly deuterium pickup, semi-empirical predictive models have also been developed to represent the behaviour of an average tube. The effect of material variability on corrosion behaviour is less well defined compared with other properties. Improvements in manufacturing have increased fracture resistance by minimising trace elements, especially H and Cl, and reduced variability by tightening controls on forming parameters, especially hot-working temperatures.

Auxiliary electron and ion guns provide additional in situ capabilities for scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scanning Auger microscopy (SAM) and composition depth profiling. The application of this facility to the characterization of irradiated fuel materials will be illustrated with selected results taken from a detailed study of the microchemistry at the fuel-sheath interface in a CANDU fuel element that was irradiated to extended burnup in the NRU (National Research Universal) reactor at CRL Inside surfaces of the end caps and the welds between the sheath and the end caps as well as the thin-walled Zircaloy-4 sheath were analyzed. The in situ SEM capability was essential for selecting different areas on each sample, such as sheath locations with and without a visible retained CANLUB graphite layer, for XPS analysis. Effective infiltration of segregated fission products, especially cesium, into the graphite was demonstrated by depth profiling. A richer chemistry of segregated fission products was found on the end caps than on the sheath with elevated levels of barium, strontium, tellurium. iodine and cadmium as well as cesium. The results are consistent with current understanding of the primary migration route for fission products to the sheath and also indicate that the CANLUB layer functions as a chemical rather than a physical barrier to segregated fission products.

Advanced fuel cycles for use in PHWRs	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on the Advances in Nuclear Materials	DEC 12-14, 2006	Bhabha Atom Res Ctr, Bombay, INDIA	Board Res Nucl Sci, Dept Atom Energy	Bhabha Atom Res Ctr		REACTOR	Pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWRs) were originally designed for employing once through fuel cycles with natural uranium. The excellent neutron economy and on-line fueling due to limited excess reactivity are important characteristics of these reactors. However, PHWRs have the main drawback of low burn-up, approximately 7500 MWd/T, due to the use of natural uranium. Use of neutron absorbers for control and power flattening further deteriorates the burn-up. All these aspects, specific to PHWRs, also lead to management of large quantities of: (i) initial fuel (ii) irradiated fuel, and (iii) radioactive wastes. Some of these drawbacks can be alleviated with high burn-up fuel, which also improves fuel utilization. Slightly enriched uranium and plutonium have been under consideration for this purpose. In situ production of U(233), by using thorium along with appropriate fissile feed, is one possibility. Alternatively, U(233) can be generated externally in fast breeder reactors. it has been recognized that, when used along with thorium, PHWRs can also serve as efficient burners of excess plutonium accumulated over the years. Fuel cycles have been designed so as to completely reverse the isotopic composition (fissile to fertile ratio) which exists at the beginning of a cycle. These cycles also envisage producing proliferation resistant fuels containing high gamma-active decay products. Most of the reactor physics aspects of the various fuel cycles can be analyzed using simple methods of neutron physics and fuel burn-up. Multi-group techniques and explicit representations of the PHWR cluster geometry are essential. However, core physics and fuel management calculations can be simplified at an exploratory stage. Nevertheless, it is necessary to make sure, using core analyses, that the new fuel cycles do satisfy all the constraints of flux peaking, controllability, coolant void reactivity, etc. The main aim in this paper is to provide a comparative evaluation of the various advanced fuel cycles that are feasible in PHWRs.

J	Hecker, SS; Stan, M				Hecker, Siegfried S.; Stan, Marius			Properties of plutonium and its alloys for use as fast reactor fuels	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on the Advances in Nuclear Materials	DEC 12-14, 2006	Bhabha Atom Res Ctr, Bombay, INDIA	Board Res Nucl Sci, Dept Atom Energy	Bhabha Atom Res Ctr		PU-GA ALLOYS; LIQUID PLUTONIUM; ZIRCONIUM SYSTEM; SOUND-VELOCITY; BINARY-SYSTEMS; EQUILIBRIUM; VISCOSITY; LMR	Early interest in metallic plutonium fuels for fast reactors led to much research on plutonium alloy systems including binary solid solutions with the addition of aluminum, gallium. or zirconium and low melting eutectic alloys with iron and nickel or cobalt. There was also interest in ternaries of these elements with plutonium and cerium. The solid solution and eutectic alloys have most unusual properties, including negative thermal expansion in some solid-solution alloys and the highest viscosity known for liquid metals in the Pu-Fe system. Although metallic fuels have many potential advantages over ceramic fuels, the early attempts were unsuccessful because these fuels suffered from high swelling rates during burn up and high smearing densities. The liquid metal fuels experienced excessive corrosion. Subsequent work on higher melting U-Pu-Zr metallic fuels was much more promising. In light of the recent rebirth of interest in fast reactors, we review some of the key properties of the early fuels and discuss the challenges presented by the ternary alloys. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Utilisation of thorium in reactors	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on the Advances in Nuclear Materials	DEC 12-14, 2006	Bhabha Atom Res Ctr, Bombay, INDIA	Board Res Nucl Sci, Dept Atom Energy	Bhabha Atom Res Ctr			India's nuclear programme envisages a large-scale utilisation of thorium, as it has limited deposits of uranium but vast deposits of thorium. The large-scale utilisation of thorium requires the adoption of closed fuel cycle. The stable nature of thoria and the radiological issues associated with thoria poses challenges in the adoption of a closed fuel cycle. A thorium fuel based Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR) is being planned to provide impetus to development of technologies for the closed thorium fuel cycle. Thoria fuel has been loaded in Indian reactors and test irradiations have been carried out with (Th-Pu) MOX fuel. Irradiated thorium assemblies have been reprocessed and the separated (233)U fuel has been used for test reactor KAMINI. The paper highlights the Indian experience with the use of thorium and brings out various issues associated with the thorium cycle. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Behaviour of irradiated PHWR fuel pins during high temperature heating	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on the Advances in Nuclear Materials	DEC 12-14, 2006	Bhabha Atom Res Ctr, Bombay, INDIA	Board Res Nucl Sci, Dept Atom Energy	Bhabha Atom Res Ctr			Fuel pins removed from an irradiated pressurised heavy water reactor (PHWR) fuel bundle discharged after an extended burn up of 15,000 MWd/tU have been subjected to isothermal heating tests in temperature range 700-1300 degrees C inside hot-cells. The heating of the fuel pins was carried out using a specially designed remotely operable furnace. which allowed localized heating of about 100 man length of the fuel pin at one end under flowing argon gas or in air atmosphere. Post-test examination performed in the hot-cells included visual examination, leak testing, dimension measurement and optical and scanning electron microscopy. Fuel pins having internal pressure of 2.1-2.7 MPa due to fission gas release underwent ballooning and micro cracking during heating for 10 min at 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C but not at 700 degrees C. Fuel pin heated at 1300 degrees C showed complete disruption of cladding in heating zone, due to the embrittlement of the cladding. The examination of fuel from the pin tested at 1300 degrees C showed presence of large number of bubbles; both intragranular as well as intergranular bubbles. Details of the experiments and the results are presented in this paper. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Viswanathan, U.

The blind problem for this exercise was based on a PHWR fuel bundle irradiated in Kakrapar Atomic Power Station-1 (KAPS-1) up to about 15 000 MWd/tU and subjected to detailed post-irradiation examination (PIE) in the hot cells facility at BARC. Eleven computer codes from seven countries participated in this exercise. The participants provided blind predictions of fuel temperature, fission gas release, internal gas pressure and other performance parameters for the fuel pins. The predictions were compared with the experimental PIE data which included fuel temperature derived from fuel restructuring, fission gas release measured by fuel pin puncturing, internal gas pressure in pin, cladding oxidation and fuel microstructural data. The details of the blind problem and an analysis of the results of blind predictions by the codes vis-A-vis measured data are provided in this paper. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Jeong, H; Chang, SH				Jeong, Hyedong; Chang, Soon Heung			Development of a method of evaluating an inventory of fission products for a pebble bed reactor	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								The design of the high temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) has evolved and the relevant safety requirements have been defined; accordingly, the source term to be used as the basis for licensing must also be developed. However, analysis of the source term in the HTGR has not been adequately investigated and there has not been definite improvement in this respect. Because radioactivity in normal operation must be well understood, the purpose of this study is to establish a method for activity evaluation by the code combination MCNP-ORIGEN-MONTEBURNS-MOTEX. The sophisticated method, which constructs the HTR-10 core by using the unit lattice of a hexagonal prism, is developed for core modeling. The MCNP modeling is used to simulate the generation of fission products with an increase of burnup, and ORIGEN is utilized for depletion calculation of each fission product. Continuous fuel management is divided into five discrete periods for the feeding and discharging of fuel pebbles. MONTEBURNS is used for discrete fuel management. In short, this work by aid from MOTEX traces 41 isotope nuclides, the results of which seem highly probable. In addition, the inventory of actinides at the end of each cycle is also investigated. It would be informative when the waste management of spent fuel of HTGRs would be taken into account. This article lays the foundation for future work on the analysis of the source term in HTGRs and will hopefully serve as a platform from which the safety assessment of radioactive material release during accidents can be undertaken in future.

J	Subbaiah, KV; Sarangapani, R				Subbaiah, K. V.; Sarangapani, R.			IGSHIELD: A new interactive point kernel gamma ray shielding code	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								IGSHIELD is an interactive gamma ray shielding code (stand alone) developed in Visual Basic Version 6.0 for windows operating system. The computational methodology is based on the point kernel technique employed in QADCGPIC (and hence QADCGGP) code. In IGSHIELD, all the features of QADCGPIC code written in FORTRAN and its user interface GU12QAD-3D written in visual basic have been incorporated and several additional improvements have been made. The new improvements made in the code are (i) handling of multiple source shapes with accompanying energy distributions, (ii) incorporation of hexagonal cylinder as a shield body in the combinatorial geometry routine, (iii) provision to declare hexagonal cylinder and truncated right circular cone as source bodies, (iv) provision to declare point, line and plane as source bodies and (v) arbitrary orientation of sources such as cylinder, hexagonal cylinder and truncated cone. The newly introduced source bodies will be of immense use for calculations involving hexagonal shaped cylindrical sub-assemblies of fast reactors and cone shaped radioactive plume release from stack. The source array option will be of use for calculations involving stacked radioactive drums in vast storage areas. The code is validated by comparing the results with (i) simple source-shield configurations that can be solved using analytical equations and MCNP code, (ii) a point source in an infinite shield medium configuration that is solved using simple analytical equation and (iii) a standard problem in which an irradiated fuel is surrounded by various shielding materials and the problem is solved using MCNP. Several sample problems encountered in nuclear industry and other useful information required for shield designers and analysts are the other highlights of the code. The input for any kind of situations can be prepared easily using the forms that flash with appropriate prompts. Since entry of data is the important part of the input, its validity is checked immediately and the user is cautioned against incorrect data. The input module accepts only the correct data. If the data happens to be an object, the code instantaneously display the 3D view of all the objects built so far. Thus, the Interactive Gamma Ray Shielding Code will cater the needs of a shield designer as well as serve as an excellent educational tool. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Subbaiah, K.

A comparison of dose rate calculations for a spent fuel storage cask by using MCNP and SAS4	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							MONTE-CARLO; SHIELDING CALCULATIONS; VARIANCE REDUCTION	This paper presents a detailed comparison of the surface dose rate calculations for the NAC-UMS spent fuel storage cask by using MCNP and SAS4 computer codes. Their accuracy and computation efficiencies are compared. For such a real world deep penetration and streaming problem, effective variance reduction techniques are indispensable for a Monte Carlo simulation to obtain results of small statistic errors within reasonable computing time. The TORT-coupled MCNP calculation based on the CADIS methodology has been used in this study. The main differences between MCNP and SAS4 calculations are the underlying cross-section libraries and the adjoint functions used for variance reduction in Monte Carlo simulations. The cross-section libraries and their formats should be the root cause for some significant discrepancies between the MCNP and SAS4 results. In addition, limited by the 1 D adjoint biasing scheme, SAS4 is inefficient in calculating the dose rates near inlet/outlet apertures. Considering all the computer time spent and the statistical errors of results obtained, the overall computation efficiency by using the TORT-coupled MCNP is better than SAS4 in the shielding calculations of spent fuel storage casks. More specifically, although the SAS4 efficiency is better when the cask side calculation is the only concern, the TORT-coupled MCNP technique is more efficient for the gamma-ray transport in cask top configurations and almost all the vent-streaming problems.

Two-phase modeling of a gas phase fluidized bed reactor for the fluorination of uranium tetrafluoride	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							POLYMERIZATION; SIMULATION; DIOXIDE; PERFORMANCE; PLASMA	A bubbling fluidized bed reactor for the fluorination of uranium tetrafluoride by fluorine gas was simulated employing two-phase models. with the bubble phase assumed to be in plug flow, and the emulsion phase in plug flow (P-P model) and in perfectly mixed flow (P-M model). The model calculations were compared with actual data in term of fluorine conversion. The comparison showed that the P-M model predicted the data satisfactorily. The P-M model was then applied to understand the influence of operating parameters on the reactor performance. A sensitivity study of various operating parameters showed the extent each parameter can influence the rates of fluorine conversion and uranium hexafluoride production. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Recovery of Tc-99m from Na-2[Mo-99]MoO4 solution obtained from reactor-produced (n,gamma) Mo-99 using a tiny Dowex-1 column in tandem with a small alumina column	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Tc-99m/Mo-99 generator; Low specific activity Mo-99; [Mo-99]Na2MoO4 in sodium hydroxide solution; Dowex-1	POST-ELUTION CONCENTRATION; ANION-EXCHANGER COLUMN; GENERATOR; TECHNETIUM; SEPARATION; RHENIUM	A simple separation technique of Tc-99m from Na-2[(MoO)-Mo-99]MoO4 in sodium hydroxide solution obtained from the Mo-98(n,gamma)Mo-99 reaction is described. Low to medium specific activity Mo-99-molybdate solution of 7.4-18.5 GBq (200-500mCi) in sodium hydroxide was passed through a tiny Dowex-1 column (25 mg) to separate the Tc-99m from the Mo-99; subsequently the Tc-99m was eluted from the Dowex I column with tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) solution (1 mg/5 ml methylene chloride). The TBAB solution was passed through a small alumina column (1.5 g) where the 99mTc is retained and separated from TBAB and CH2Cl2. Technetium-99m from the alumina column was finally eluted with 5 ml saline leaving any traces of 99Mo on the alumina column. The separation yield was about 90% (n = 10). The method has applicability for decontamination of Tc-99g from spent 99Mo waste solution and recovery of Tc-99g for research use. The procedure should also be equally applicable for recovery of (ReO4)-Re-188 from (WO4)-W-188 in a radioisotope laboratory. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Determination of photon attenuation coefficient, porosity and field capacity of soil by gamma-ray transmission for 60, 356 and 662 keV gamma rays	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Photon attenuation coefficient; Porosity; Field capacity; Gamma-ray transmission	AMORPHOUS MATERIALS; WATER CONTENT; DENSITY	Gamma-ray transmission methods have been used accurately for the study of the properties of soil in the agricultural purposes. In this study, photon attenuation coefficient, porosity and field capacity of soil are determined by using gamma-ray transmission method. To this end, the soil sample was collected from Erzurum and a 2 x 2 in Nal (TI) scintillation detector measured the attenuation of strongly collimated monoenergetic gamma beam through soil sample. The radioactive sources used in the experiment were (241)Am, (133)Ba and (137)Cs. The mass attenuation coefficients of dry soil samples were calculated from the transmission measurements. The soil samples were irrigated by adding known quantities of water and the soil-water properties were examined. It was observed that gamma-ray transmission method for determination of the soil parameters has advantages such as practical, inexpensive, non-destructive and fast analysis. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Practical method for radioactivity distribution analysis in small-animal PET cancer studies	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						PET imaging; Calibrated source; 3D reconstruction; Radioactivity analysis; Small-animal cancer studies	HUMAN PROSTATE-CANCER; RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHMS; IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION; RADIATION-DOSIMETRY; MEMBRANE ANTIGEN; STANDARD UPTAKE; UPTAKE VALUES; MASS-BALANCE; BONE; TUMORS	We present a practical method for radioactivity distribution analysis in small-animal tumors and organs using positron emission tomography imaging with a calibrated source of known activity and size in the field of view. We reconstruct the imaged mouse together with a source under the same conditions, using an iterative method, Maximum likelihood expectation-maximization with system modeling, capable of delivering high-resolution images. Corrections for the ratios of geometrical efficiencies, radioisotope decay in time and photon attenuation are included in the algorithm. We demonstrate reconstruction results for the amount of radioactivity within the scanned mouse in a sample study of osteolytic and osteoblastic bone metastasis from prostate cancer xenografts. Data acquisition was performed on the small-animal PET system, which was tested with different radioactive sources, phantoms and animals to achieve high sensitivity and spatial resolution. Our method uses high-resolution images to determine the volume of organ or tumor and the amount of their radioactivity has the possibility of saving time, effort and the necessity to sacrifice animals. This method has utility for prognosis and quantitative analysis in small-animal cancer studies, and will enhance the assessment of characteristics of tumor growth, identifying metastases, and potentially determining the effectiveness of cancer treatment. The possible application for this technique could be useful for the organ radioactivity dosimetry studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Determination of the elemental constituents of a natural dolerite using NIRR-1	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Elemental; Characterization; Dolerite; Nigeria; NIRR-1	THERMOLUMINESCENCE; SAMPLES; INAA	Elemental characterization of natural dolerite obtained from South Western Nigeria has been carried out using Nigeria Research Reactor-1 (NIRR-1) located at the Centre for Energy Research and Training (CERT), Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria. The measurements showed the presence of aluminum, calcium, magnesium, titanium and iron with concentrations 69,990 +/- 3499, 61,140 +/- 8.0, 38,330 +/- 3929, 13,880 +/- 1804 and 8319 +/- 150 ppm, respectively, as the major elements. In addition, 16 other elements, in minor and trace quantities, including Th, a radioactive rare earth element and five other rare earth elements La, Ce, Sm, Dy and Lu were identified. The presence of the rare earth elements may be a confirmation of the previous argument that the observed single but broad glow peak in the glow curve of this rock is rather an overlap of more than one glow peak. The presence of Th suggests the possibility of internal radioactivity in the rock, a necessary criterion for using a material for luminescence dating. Thus, this work indicates that dolerite can be used for luminescence dating if properly developed for the purpose. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[Mokobia, C.

Application of alpha track registration technique for plutonium estimation in bioassay samples	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Plutonium; Bioassay samples; Alpha track technique; SSNTDs; Alpha spectrometry		Bioassay monitoring is carried out for occupational workers handling plutonium (Pu) in nuclear facilities. In India, presently Pu estimation in bioassay samples is done by alpha spectrometry. The minimum detectable activity (MIDA) of alpha spectrometry is 0.5 mBq for a counting period of I day. To reduce the load of sample counting on alpha spectrometry, an alternative method based on alpha track registration in solid state nuclear track detectors (SSNTDs) is developed in the present paper. For this purpose, few urine samples of normal subjects spiked with known amounts of Pu in the range of 0.5-5.5 mBq were exposed to CR-39 SSNTDs. The total number of alpha tracks seen in the CR-39 films of the sample and the standard were used to calculate the amount of Pu in the sample. The results of alpha track registration technique were also compared with that obtained by the well-established alpha spectrometry and were found to agree well within +/- 30%. The minimum amount of Pu that can be analyzed by this method is 0.18 mBq for an exposure period of 45 days (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved	[Sawant, Pramilla D.; Prabhu, S.

Investigation of the oxidation states of Pu isotopes in a hydrochloric acid solution	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Oxidation states of Pu; Hydrochloric acid solution; Separation of Pu	ANION-EXCHANGE; ION-EXCHANGE; RADIOCHEMICAL DETERMINATION; ENVIRONMENTAL-SAMPLES; BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES; PLUTONIUM; SEPARATION; AM-241	The characteristics of the oxidation states of Pu in a hydrochloric acid solution were investigated and the results were applied to a separating of Pu isotopes from IAEA reference soils. The oxidation states of Pu(III) and Pu(IV) were prepared by adding hydroxylamine hydrochloride and sodium nitrite to a Pu stock solution, respectively. Also, the oxidation state of Pu(VI) was adjusted with concentrated HNO3 and HCIO4. The stability of the various oxidation states of plutonium in a HCl solution with elapsed time after preparation were found to be in the following order: Pu(III)approximate to Pu(VI)>Pu(IV)>Pu(V). The chemical recoveries of Pu(IV) in a 9 M HCl solution with an anion exchange resin were similar to those of Pu(VI). This method for the determination of Pu isotopes with an anion exchange resin in a 9 M HCI medium was applied to IAEA reference soils where the activity concentrations of Pu-239.240 and Pu-238 in IAEA-375 and IAEA-326 were consistent with the reference values reported by the IAEA.

Samples were collected from the ventilation stack of the operating Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) reactor, the shut down reactor and in the ground-level air. The insolubility in water of radionuclides attached to aerosol particles sampled on filters, collected in the operating Unit 2 reactor effluents, is clearly lower than the insolubility in water of radionuclides attached to aerosol particles sampled on filters, collected in the ground-level air. The mean rate of the change in the insolubility in water of Co-60 and Cs-137 attached to aerosol particles, released from the Ignalina NPP and registered at a 3.5 km distance from the NPP, is estimated. The radionuclide activity concentration distribution in the ground-level air is calculated in respect of the insolubility in water of Co-60 attached to aerosol particles and compared with experimental data.

Studies on spatial and temporal variation in SOC and total N are of great importance because of global environmental concerns. Soil erosion is one of the major processes affecting the redistribution of SOC and total N in the test fields. To characterize the distribution and dynamics of SOC and N in the intensively eroded soil of the headwaters of the Yangtze River, China, we measured profiles of soil organic C, total N stocks, and Cs-137 in a control plot and a treatment plot. The amounts of SOC, Cs-137 of sampling soil profiles increased in the following order, lower> middle> upper portions on the control plot, and the amounts of total N ofsampling soil profile increase in the following order: upper> middle> lower on the control plot. Intensive soil erosion resulted in a significant decrease of SOC amounts by 34.9%, 28.3% and 52.6% for 0-30 cm soil layer at upper, middle and lower portions and (CS)-C-137 inventory decreased by 68%, 11% and 85% at upper, middle and lower portions, respectively. On the treatment plot total N decreased by 50.2% and 14.6% at the upper and middle portions and increased by 48.9% at the lower portion. Coefficients of variation (CVs) of SOC decreased by 31%, 37% and 30% in the upper, middle and lower slope portions, respectively. Similar to the variational trend of SOC, CVS of Cs-137 decreased by 19.2%, 0.5% and 36.5%; and total N decreased by 45.7%, 65.1% and 19% in the upper, middle and lower slope portions, respectively. The results showed that Cs-137, SOC and total N moved on the sloping land almost in the same physical mechanism during the soil erosion procedure, indicating that fallout of Cs-137 Could be used directly for quantifying dynamic SOC and total N redistribution as the soil was affected by intensive soil erosion.

Desae program for systems studies of long-term growth of nuclear power	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The DESAE computer program has been developed, within the framework of the INPRO project implemented under IAEA aegis, as a program complex for making predictive calculations of nuclear power growth. The main purpose of these calculations is to determine the most likely trends in the structural development and scales of the industry and the expected time frames when the new technologies will be needed. Their main benefit lies in the possibility of constructing a balanced picture, as close to reality as possible, of the future structure and developing on this basis a well-substantiated program for strategic scientific-technical policy. A brief presentation of a DESAE calculation of a scenario for nuclear power growth in the country up to 2100 is given. This scenario corresponds to the above-mentioned requirement of balance with respect to the consumption of natural uranium as well as the amount of electricity and heat that will be required.

Simulation of nuclear-physical processes in the surface layer of a fuel kernel with a consumable absorber	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The structure, density, and chemical and phase state of nuclear fuel change considerably with deep burnup. In the present work, the neutron-physical processes in the peripheral layer of a fuel kernel with a consumable absorber are simulated. It is shown that plutonium will actively accumulate in a 50-200 mu m thick surface layer. The burnup depth in this layer will be much greater than the average value over the fuel assemblies. A combined fuel element with an absorber where the central part has the usual enrichment (4-5% (235)U) and does not contain consumable absorbers and the peripheral layer consists completely of the consumable element is proposed to decrease the influence of consumable absorbers on fuel properties.

J	Jager, G; Weis, M				Jaeger, Gerd; Weis, Michael			Nuclear Power Research Funding 1956-2007: Startup Funding or Subsidy? An Update	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								The latest outline of nuclear power research funding since 1956 was written roughly 4 years ago. This makes it appropriate to update facts and figures to the 2007 status. Another reason for doing so is the Current political debate about an extension of plant life of German nuclear power stations. One objective of these debates frequently is seen to be the use of absurd figures about "subsidies" in an attempt to discredit the economic benefit of nuclear power. The research situation has not changed much. A continued low level of funding of nuclear research, on the one hand, is opposed by a high level of electricity generation from nuclear power, on the other hand. Present nuclear power plants generating electricity have never received any subsidies. Various federal governments, most recently the Schroder government, made this point absolutely clear. Public R&D funds were intended to be startup aids convincingly serving their purpose where the respective technologies were able to unfold. Consequently, the economic benefit of the development of nuclear power is beyond any doubt. Another wrong statement is the allegation that the demolition of nuclear power plants and the management of radioactive waste were paid for out of taxpayers' money. In fact, these costs are already included in the price of electricity, and the necessary capital outlay is posted in the appropriate provisions.

J	Weis, M				Weis, Michael			Nuclear Fission - the Unexpected Discovery Seventy Years ago	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article							RADIATION; URANIUM	Seventy years ago, on December 17, 1938, Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, and Fritz Strassmann discovered nuclear fission. It was a serendipitous discovery resulting from the consistent pursuit, for many years, of occasionally unexpected radiochemical experimental findings. Hardly any other scientific discovery has had such direct bearing on our life, changing our view of the world. It overthrew the tenet of physics, believed to be incontestable, that the atom was indivisible. The use of nuclear power it has made possible has given rise to immense benefits, but it has also allowed mankind's most dreadful weapon so far to be developed. All this is ample reason seventy years later to recall the discovery, the discoverers and their times. It will also be shown what later generations have made of this discovery, and what economic and ecological prospects it continues to hold.

J	Stoll, W				Stoll, Wolfgang			Seventy Years of Nuclear Fission. What Has Become of the Nuclear Option?	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								On December 17, 1938, almost exactly 70 years ago, Otto Hahn for the first time identified barium as a product of uranium fission. The discovery is worth remembering, although it may seem less exciting now than at the time. The approximately 450 nuclear power plants in operation worldwide, 200 nuclear reactors installed as propulsion units of icebreakers and submarines, and roughly 400 smaller nuclear reactors for research and medicine utilize the nuclear fission process, discovered at that time, on a large scale in more than 1,000 places in the world for a variety of purposes. The maximum attainable fission rate of roughly 10(9) fissions per second attainable by the polonium-beryllium source on Otto Hahns laboratory bench has meanwhile been increased to 10 This state of affairs can be compared to other basic innovations, such as the railway, which was introduced in Germany on the Nuremberg - Furth line in 1835 and, despite catastrophic derailments and crashes, has become a generally accepted means of transport seventy years later without which modern life would not be conceivable. At least in this country, nuclear power has not yet become a generally accepted reality. The 17 nuclear power plants safely operated in Germany, which generate most of our baseload electricity, are threatened by permanent shutdown for purely ideological reasons although no substitute power Source is in sight. This development, and its many twists and turns, is described mainly from a German point of view.		Stoll, W (reprint author), Ameliastr 25, D-63452 Hanau, Germany.

J	Heller, W				Heller, W.			Second Strategic Energy Report of the European Union - More Security of Supply with Nuclear Power	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								On November 13, 2008, the EU Commission presented the Second Strategic Energy Report. The Report was supplemented by one proposed directive each on the security of gas supply and on oil stockpiling, by a Multitude of measures to improve energy efficiency, and by 2 communications by the Commission on offshore wind energy and the nuclear program of the EU. The Commission attaches strategic importance in securing energy supply to the domestic energy resources, renewables, coal, and nuclear power. Moreover, the Commission assigns to the use of nuclear power an important role in the transition to an economy causing only a minimum of CO(2) emissions. The updated nuclear program contains these proposals: - The Most up-to-date technology is to be employed in the construction of new reactors, and - the highest standards of nuclear safety are to be applied. - The diverse licensing conditions and procedures currently existing in the member states are to be harmonized. A few days earlier, the Nuclear Energy, Agency (NEA) of OECD had presented the 2008 Nuclear Energy Outlook in which the points raised by the EU Commission are Outlined in the same sense for the OECD member countries. Germany clearly continues to be in an isolated position worldwide in opting out of the use of nuclear power. This raises the question when and in what way political majorities may again be found which would prevent the enforcement of laws in the interest of phasing out nuclear power, and get rid of the irrational blockages in spent fuel and nuclear waste management.									0	0	0	0	5	INFORUM VERLAGS-VERWALTUNGSGESELLSCHAFT MBH	BERLIN	ROBERT-KOCH-PLATZ 4, BERLIN, 10115, GERMANY	1431-5254			ATW-INT J NUCL POWER	ATW-Int.

A major objective of the ITER project is to demonstrate that a future power producing fusion device can be maintained effectively and offer practical levels of plant availability. During its operational lifetime, many systems of the ITER machine will require maintenance and modification: this can be achieved using remote handling methods. The need for timely, safe and effective remote operations on a machine as complex as ITER and within one of the world's most hostile remote handling environments represents a major challenge at every level of the ITER Project organization, engineering and technology. The basic principles of fusion reactor maintenance are presented. An updated description of the ITER remote maintenance system is provided. This includes the maintenance equipment used inside the vacuum vessel, inside the hot cell and the hot cell itself. The correlation between the functions of the remote handling equipment, of the hot cell and of the radwaste processing system is also described. The paper concludes that ITER has equipped itself with a good platform to tackle the challenges presented by its own maintenance and upgrade needs. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Six half port TBMs and associated systems ire expected to be tested simultaneously in three available Test Ports. This paper presents an initial assessment of the TBM and ITER interface requirements. Four areas of interface were identified. The first area is the port cell interface area, including components like the port plug frame, backside shield, dummy TBM and corresponding tools needed for the TBM maintenance and replacement. The second area is the hot cell, including the needed additional hardware for the service of TBMs, additional remote handling tools, and additional building space needed for the maintenance of the TBM ancillary equipment and the corresponding testing utilities and tools. The third area is the tokamak cooling water system (TCWS) with the need to accommodate six TBM hear transfer systems, each with a footprint of 57 m(2). The Fourth area of interface is the tritium plant. In all these areas modifications in the current ITER design are needed to accommodate the TMB testing. These changes must be incorporated in the new ITER baseline design which is now under preparation. The latest experiments on JET revealed unexpectedly high sensitivity of plasmas in H-mode of confinement to ripples of the magnetic field. The ferromagnetic rest modules can create additional ripples. This new issue of interface between ITER and TBMs is also addressed. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Chuyanov, V.

Further validation activity is still needed which could be performed in ITER, especially for activation cross sections, for dose rate calculations and for tritium production rates. In particular, concerning the nuclear performance of breeder blankets to be tested in ITER, the paper discusses the extensive preparatory work, to be carried out in a coordinated way among the participating Parties, required to finalize the design of neutronics Test Blanket Modules (TBMs). so that these tests can provide a complete and comparable, therefore useful, Picture of the different concepts. Neutronics experiments being carried out at neutron generators on TBM mock-ups are providing important results on the quality of relevant neutron cross sections and for the preparation of the measurement techniques.

The scientific concept of this program is to study the elemental technology in macroscopic system integration for advanced fusion blankets based on an understanding of the relevant mechanics at the microscopic level. The program has four main research emphases: (1) Flibe molten salt system: Flibe handling, reduction-oxidation control by Be and Flibe tritium chemistry: thermofluid flow simulation experiment and numerical analysis. (2) Vanadium /Li system: MHD ceramics coating of vanadium alloys and compatibility with Li: neutron irradiation experiment in Li capsule and radiation creep. (3) SiC/He system: Fabrication of advanced composites and property evaluation; thermomechanics of SiC system with solid breeding materials; neutron irradiation experiment in He capsule at high temperatures. (4) Blanket system modeling: Design-based integration modeling of Flibe system and V/Li system; multiscale materials system modeling including He effects. This paper describes the perspective of the program including the historical background, the organization and facilities, and the task objectives. Important recent results are reviewed.

For the demonstration power reactor (DEMO) design, we will have to accommodate the neutron wall loading and first wall heat flux, breed and extract adequate tritium for the D-T fuel cycle and achieve high coolant outlet temperature for high power conversion efficiency. Most proposed liquid metal TBMs have the potential of achieving similar DEMO goals and requirements. Furthermore, all liquid metal TBMs are to satisfy ITER safety requirements and to be operated and tested within ITER operation scenarios. For the development of liquid metal TBM concepts. many R&D elements are common to a few designs such as the areas of Reduced Activation Ferritic/Martensitic Steel (RAFM, also abbreviated as FS in the following) or V-alloy fabrication, thermal fluid MHD, FS/PbLi, FS/Li and V-alloy/Li compatibility, irradiation effects on different materials, tritium extraction. SiC flow channel insert (FCI) development, etc. With a well-coordinated ITER TBM program, different parties' R&D activities can supplement and complement each other via collaborations. This paper will present respective designs and R&D programs from seven ITER parties. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Wong, C. P.

Russian concept for a DEMO-S demonstration fusion power reactor	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 30-OCT 05, 2007	Heidelberg, GERMANY	Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe		Demonstration power tokamak reactor; Steady-state plasma operation; Helium-cooled ceramic tritium breeding blanket; Liquid lithium tritium breeding blanket; Vanadium alloy refabrication	ITER; BLANKET; SAFETY	Conceptual design studies for a tokamak-based demonstration fusion reactor have been carried out in Russia since 1991. The preferred concept was a steady-state operating tokamak with superconducting magnets, a single-null divertor configuration and a high contribution of bootstrap current into a plasma current drive. Two blanket concepts were analyzed: (I) a helium-cooled ceramic (Li(4)SiO(4)) design for tritium breeding, using ferritic steel as the structural material, and (2) a blanket using liquid lithium for the tritium breeding material and coolant and a vanadium-chromium-titanium alloy as the structural material. Conventional-type water/lithium-cooled divertor targets with a maximum heat load of similar to 10 MW/m(2) were chosen. Blankets of both designs require beryllium as a neutron multiplier and have to be replaced after the integral fusion neutron load on the first wall reaches 10 MW a/m(2). The results of the analyses show the necessity of additional studies prior to choosing the most promising blanket concept for further development. Aspects of radioactive waste management and scarce material recycling were also considered. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Kolbasov, B. N.; Borisov, A. A.; Leonov, V. M.; Shatalov, G.

Recent research and development for the dual-coolant blanket concept in the US	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 30-OCT 05, 2007	Heidelberg, GERMANY	Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe		Dual-coolant lead-lithium; Blanket; MHD; Pb-17Li; Conductivity; Compatibility; Tritium permeation	DENSITY CONSERVATIVE SCHEME; INCOMPRESSIBLE MHD FLOWS; MAGNETIC REYNOLDS-NUMBER; COMPATIBILITY ISSUES; POWER-PLANT; ARIES-CS; PB-17LI BLANKET; SILICON-CARBIDE; FUSION; TEMPERATURE	The dual-coolant lead-lithium, or DCLL, blanket concept is of strong interest in the US fusion technology program. In the DCLL blanket, the flow channel insert (FCI) is a critical component. FCIs must have low electrical and thermal conductivity and be compatible with lead-lithium eutectic alloy (Pb-17Li) at elevated temperatures. FCIs must retain structural integrity and desirable properties even under irradiation and large temperature gradients during operation. FCIs must not fail in such a way that Pb-17Li enters the FCI and changes its electrical or thermal conductivity significantly. Another important issue for the DCLL is the development of a suitable tritium extraction from the Pb-17Li to achieve low tritium partial pressure, thus facilitating decisive tritium control. In this paper, the state of DCLL development in the US is presented including recent design modifications and results from recent R&D efforts. Such R&D includes the progress on development and property quantification of SiC/SiC composites and SiC foams as candidate FCI materials; Pb-17Li material capability and infiltration studies; simulations of MHD Pb-17Li flow characteristics and of resultant temperature distributions; and the analysis of FCI stress states based on these thermal loads. In addition, tritium extraction from Pb-17Li based on a vacuum permeator concept is shown to have the potential to achieve the desired tritium control. A discussion of DCLL optimization and unresolved DCLL issues and future R&D needs is also presented. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Morley, N.

In the development stage, Na and NaK were carefully compared and the former was chosen. In the nuclear fusion application, liquid metals of Li or LiPb will be used as a coolant and tritium breeder, A nuclear reactor requires two materials of moderator and coolant. Water or sodium satisfies double duty, leading to the oligopoly situation by LWR or Na-FBR. The Success of these reactors depends on the selection of coolant material that works as a moderator. Oil an analogy of this history, fusion power plant should be integrated to employ a coolant that works as tritium breeder, Such as Li or LiPb. Technology progresses in the system design are introduced, which will have synergy effect for fusion. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

All the tritium and deuterium in the exhaust are recovered, purified and returned to the tokamak with minimal delay, so that extended burn can be sustained with limited inventory. To maintain the safety of the entire facility, plant scale detritiation systems will also continuously run to remove tritium from the effluents at the maximum efficiency. In this entire tritium plant system. extremely high decontamination factor, that is the ratio of the tritium loss to the processing flow rate. is required for fuel economy and minimized tritium emissions, and the system design based on the state-of-the-art technology is expected to satisfy all the requirements without significant technical challenges. Considerable part of the fusion tritium system will be verified with ITER and its decades of operation experiences. Toward the DEMO plant that will actually generate energy and operate its closed fuel cycle, breeding blanket and power train that caries high temperature and pressure media from the fusion device to the generation system will be the major addition. For the tritium confinement, safety and environmental emission, particularly blanket, its coolant, and generation systems such as heat exchanger, steam generator and turbine will be the critical systems, because the tritium permeation from the breeder and handling large amount of high temperature, high pressure coolant will be further more difficult than that required for ITER. Detritiation of solid waste such as used blanket and divertor will be another issue for both tritium economy and safety. Unlike in the case of ITER that is regarded as experimental facility, DEMO will be expected to demonstrate the safety, reliability and social acceptance issue, even if economical feature is excluded. Fuel and environmental issue to be tested in the DEMO will determine the viability of the fusion as a future energy source. Some of the subjects cannot be expected to be within the extrapolation of ITER technology and require long term efforts paralleling ITER. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Latest design of liquid lithium target in IFMIF	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 30-OCT 05, 2007	Heidelberg, GERMANY	Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe		IFMIF; Liquid lithium target; Free surface; Cold trap; Hot trap; RAFM; Neutron irradiation; Remote handling; EVEDA	IRRADIATION FACILITY IFMIF; ELEMENT TECHNOLOGY PHASE; TRITIUM; NITROGEN	This paper describes the latest design of liquid lithium (Li) target system in International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF). IFMIF is an accelerator-driven intense neutron source for fusion reactor materials testing. Two 40 MeV deuteron beams with a total current of 250 mA strikes a liquid Li target circulating in a Li loop. The Li target is to provide a stable Li jet at a speed of 10-20 m/s to handle an averaged heat flux of 1 GW/m(2), A concaved Li flow is applied to avoid Li boiling. A cold trap and two kinds of hot trap are applied to control impurities (T, (7)Be, C, O, N) below permissible levels. A back wall made of RAFM is located in the most severe region of neutron irradiation (50 dpa/year). System availability requires more than 95% during plant lifetime. EVEDA tasks including Li loop are now being performed under the Broader Approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Temperature dependence of blistering and deuterium retention in tungsten exposed to high-flux and low-energy deuterium plasma	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 30-OCT 05, 2007	Heidelberg, GERMANY	Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe		Blistering; Retention; Tungsten; Deuterium; Vacancy; Plasma	NEAR-SURFACE REGION; SUPERABUNDANT VACANCIES; HIGH FLUENCES; HYDROGEN; VOIDS	The temperature dependence of blistering and deuterium retention in tungsten exposed to high-flux (10(22) D*/m(2)/s) and low-energy (38 eV) deuterium plasma was examined in the temperature range of 315-1000 K with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), focused ion beam (FIB) and thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS). Blistering occurred most severely and the retention showed the maximum at the exposure temperature of around 500 K. These results were qualitatively explained by two processes of the formation of vacancy and de-trapping of hydrogen from the vacancy-related defects. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this Study, graphite was irradiated by this method, and its erosion rate was quantitatively estimated from the CO and CO2 desorption during the discharge. With He/O-2(7%)-GDC, the erosion rate was estimated to be 4.1 x 10(-6) g cm(-2) h(-1), which corresponds to 23 nm h(-1). This erosion rate increased with O-2 mixture ratio in its discharging gas. However, the rate was not proportional to the oxygen mixture ratio because of an O-2 retention in graphite. From TDS, it is found that graphite exposed to He/O-2(7%)-GDC retained 3.1 x 10(16) O atoms/cm(2). (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

A tritium diagnostic and trap for JUDITH-First results in disruption simulation experiments with neutron irradiated beryllium during cyclic electron beam testing	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 30-OCT 05, 2007	Heidelberg, GERMANY	Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe		Beryllium; JUDITH; SEM images; Crack behaviour; Tritium trap; Activity density	HEAT; COMPONENTS	In the present study, the effect of disruptions on beryllium has been studied. Disruptions are simulated in the electron beam facility JUDITH by high energetic pulses of up to 250 Mj/m(2). Under these loads, the beryllium surface may roughen combined with the forming of cracks. During the experiments, a special problem arises from the fact that during the neutron irradiation beryllium transmutes to tritium. This tritium is bound in the beryllium matrix, but during the heating of the samples, the tritium may be set free and through the vacuum pump it maybe released to the environment. In order to avoid and to quantify this release of tritium. a special tritium trap has been constructed. In this tritium trap the gas is pumped by means of a metal bellows pump through a catalyst tube filled with copper oxide. At a temperature of 300 degrees C, the tritium is oxidized to HTO. This HTO is lead through gas washing bottles filled with water. Here approximately 98% of the released tritium is caught. The temperatures in the process are controlled by thermocouples, and the tritium content is controlled by a tritium gas monitor and in addition with a liquid scintillation counter (LSQ.
