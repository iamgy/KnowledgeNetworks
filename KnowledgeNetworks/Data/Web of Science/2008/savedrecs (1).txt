JET-EFDA-Contributors	Ex-situ tritium removal from JET tiles using RF inductive heating	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 30-OCT 05, 2007	Heidelberg, GERMANY	Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe		Depth profiles; Detritiation; RF inductive heating; JET tiles; Tritium	PLASMA-FACING COMPONENTS; FUSION MACHINES; CARBON TILES; 1ST WALL; DETRITIATION; ITER	Radio-frequency (RF) inductive heating has been successfully used as an ex-situ technique for the detritiation of entire tiles retrieved from JET The assessment of the detritiation process used three different techniques, namely autoradiography, calorimetry and full combustion assisted by the liquid scintillation analysis. Autoradiography showed that using the RF technique more than 99% of the total surface tritium inventory can be efficiently removed from a tile after several heating cycles at the average temperature of only 490 degrees C. On the other hand, a comparison of tile combustion measurements obtained before and after RF heating has shown that the bulk tritium activity decreased significantly (95% of the bulk tritium was released), while at the same time more than 99% of the surface tritium was liberated. The three methods used to assess the RF detritiation process have their advantages and disadvantages. Calorimetry allows a tough estimation of the tritium content of the complete tile, whilst IP imaging allows an approximate estimation of the content before and after detritiation but only for the Surface tritium. On the other hand, full combustion associated with scintillation analysis allows very accurate measurements but only for specific samples with reduced dimensions, therefore extrapolation is needed to estimate the tritium content of an entire tile.

This requires the development of test blanket modules based on a corresponding DEMO blanket design, despite the differences operating conditions between DEMO and ITER. Two blanket concepts such as a Helium-Cooled Solid Breeder (HCSB) blanket and a Helium-Cooled Molten Lithium (HCML) blanket are being considered as Korean Test Blanket Module (TBM) for ITER with the aim for verifying the capability of the breeding blanket design and manufacturability. In this paper, the Current status of the design and analysis for the HCSB TBM is described, The key features of the design include the use of graphite neutron reflectors to reduce the amount of beryllium multiplier. Major analyses have been executed in order to optimize the design. The results of nuclear and thermo-hydraulic analysis show that the design parameters and requirements are satisfied. Also, the safety analysis results show that the design of the TBM system is sufficient to endure several accident events. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Preliminary design of Indian Test Blanket Module for ITER	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 30-OCT 05, 2007	Heidelberg, GERMANY	Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe		ITER Test Blanket Module Program; Lead-Lithium cooled Ceramic Breeder blanket (LLCB)		Indian Test Blanket Module (TBM) program in ITER is one of the major steps in its fusion reactor program towards DEMO and future Fusion Power Reactor (FPR) vision. Along with the DEMO machine design, liquid type and solid type breeding blankets are being developed for testing in ITER. India has proposed Lead-Lithium cooled Ceramic Breeder (LLCB)as the blanket concept for its DEMO reactor. The LLCB blanket concept consists Of lithium titanate as ceramic breeder (CB) material in the form of packed pebble beds and Pb-Li eutectic as multiplier, breeder, and coolant for the CB zones. The outer box is cooled by helium. An alternative blanket concept also being considered for the development is the Helium-Cooled Solid Breeder (HCSB) concept with ferritic steel structure and Be neutron multiplier. Presently the primary focus is on the design and analysis of the LLCB TBM to assess the performance of LLCB concept for DEMO relevance. The LLCB TBM will be tested from day I operation of ITER in one-half of a designated test port. The tests in ITER include the simultaneous function of all subsystems including the TBM as well as its ancillary system. The tritium produced in Pb-Li and ceramic breeder zones will be extracted by separate external ancillary systems. The R&D activities are being initiated in all critical areas related to DEMO relevant blanket concepts in order to test the TBM in ITER. In this paper, the design description, preliminary analysis, some of the related ancillary systems and R&D activities for LLCB TBM are presented. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Deuterium retention and desorption behavior of lithium titanate	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 30-OCT 05, 2007	Heidelberg, GERMANY	Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe		Lithium titanate; Deuterium ion irradiation; Desorption temperature; Amount of retained deuterium; Blanket; Spatial distribution of temperature		Solid breeding material, lithium titanate (Li(2)TiO(3)), employed for a solid breeder blanket, was irradiated by 1.7-keV deuterium ions to investigate an amount of retained deuterium and desorption behavior of deuterium. Dependence of deuterium ion fluence on the amount of retained deuterium was also obtained. Similar experiments were conducted for Li and Ti in order to examine a trapping mechanism of deuterium in Li(2)TiO(3). Deuterium implanted to Li(2)TiO(3) desorbed in forms of HD, D(2), HDO arid D(2)O. The amount of deuterium desorbed in form of HDO was largest in these gas species. The desorption peak appeared at 600 K, but significant desorption up to 900 K was observed. The temperature in the solid breeder blanket ranges from 550 K to 1200 K. The present result suggests that the tritium produced at low temperature region is not completely desorbed during the operation. Thus, a spatial distribution of temperature in the blanket has to be controlled for the tritium to be easily desorbed. The desorption spectra of deuterium in Li(2)TiO(3) were similar to those of Li. This suggests that most of implanted deuterium is trapped in form of Li-D and Li-OD. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Experimental estimate of tritium production parameters for RF test blanket module	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 30-OCT 05, 2007	Heidelberg, GERMANY	Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe		Test blanket module (TBM); Tritium; Lithium; Monitoring canal		Tritium breeding ratio (TBR) is a most value among controlled fusion reactor parameters. One in targets of test blanket module (TBM) program is experimental investigation of the value. On the whole TBR can be Submitted for consideration TBR = BTB/BTP (BTB: breaded tritium in blanket; BTP: burned tritium in plasma). To investigate a numerator of the formula a tritium production in breeding zone (TBZ) of the TBM has to be measured under ITER plasma experiments. Tritium and neutron monitoring system with some lithium and neutron sensors are proposed. Lithium ortho-silicate and lithium carbonate and the neutron detectors fit the task. Differences isotope lithium-6 and lithium-7 can be applied. For delivery/withdrawal of the detectors into/from the TBZ a pneumatic concept is suggested with using canals allocated in module. The canals pass through the module back wall and reach the attended area. These canals allow the insertion of activation foil and capsules with material probes during the dwell time or operational pauses. Casks for the detectors and the canal for conveying of the casks in the TBM before pulse and extraction after pulse are presented in this paper. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The design and the performance of the KO HCML test blanket module (TBM) and the preliminary results of the safety analyses such as activation, decay heat, and accident analysis by a loss of coolant are introduced briefly in this paper. KO HCML TBM uses He as a coolant and Li is Used as a tritium breeder by considering its potential advantages. Two layers of graphite are inserted as a reflector in the breeder zone to increase the tritium breeding ratio (TBR) and the shielding performances. Performance analyses were performed with the MCCARD code for the neutronics, the CFX-10 code for the thermal-hydraulics, and with the ANSYS-10 code for the thermal-mechanical analysis. For the safety analyses, the activation and decay heat were obtained from the MCCARD and Origen codes. From the obtained decay heat, an accident analysis was performed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Monte Carlo based sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of the HCPB Test Blanket Module in ITER	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 30-OCT 05, 2007	Heidelberg, GERMANY	Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe		Fusion; ITER; TBM; Neutronics; Uncertainty; Nuclear data; Monte Carlo		This paper presents the first real test application of the Monte Carlo based sensitivity and uncertainty computational approach to the Test Blanket Module (TBM) in ITER. To this end the standard three-dimensional MCNP model of ITER (20 degrees torus sector) with integrated TBM of the Helium-cooled Pebble Bed (HCPB) type was employed. Sensitivity profiles and integrated sensitivities were calculated for the total tritium production in the HCPB TBM by using the track length estimator approach of MCSEN, a local extension to the Monte Carlo code MCNP. The associated uncertainties of the tritium production due to nuclear data uncertainties were assessed by making use of available co-variance data from different sources. The major contribution to the sensitivities was shown to come from the materials contained in the TBM, in particular the beryllium neutron multiplier and the breeder ceramics constituents (6)Li and (16)O. With the calculated sensitivity profiles and the available co-variance data, the cross-section induced uncertainties of the tritium production have been assessed at a level of 2.8%.

On-line hydrogen (isotopes) measurement is a key technology. The on-line hydrogen sensor made of proton conducting ceramics, CaZr0.95O3-aSc0.05, was designed to be used in reducible condition such as liquid blanket system. The CaZrO3 doped With Sc2O3 has higher chemical stability than those with the other dopant oxides such as In2O3 or Ga2O3. The evaluation of the expected performance of the sensor in molten salt LiF-BeF2 (Flibe), liquid metal lithium (Li) and lead-17 lithium (Pb-17Li) was carried out by means of the performance test in gas atmosphere at 700 degrees C with hydrogen partial pressures equivalent to those for the melts.

In particular, at the DIN a thermo mechanical constitutive model was developed for both lithiated ceramics and beryllium pebble beds and it was Successfully implemented on a commercial finite element code to analyze the experimental results of the ENEA test campaigns on TAZZA, HELICHETTA and HELICA mock-ups. The paper presents the preliminary theoretical-numerical study performed at the DIN to Support the experimental investigations on the HEXCALIBER mock-up, a more complex test section set-up by ENEA to investigate the thermo-mechanical behaviour Of Mutually interacting pairs of beryllium and lithium orthosilicate pebbles beds. In particular, after the descriptions of the HEXCALIBER mock-up and its finite element model, the numerical predictions of temperatures and/or contact pressures in the pebble beds, in the structural materials and in the helium coolant are presented and critically discussed.

Impact of reflected neutrons on accuracy of tritium production rate prediction in blanket mock-ups for fusion reactors	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 30-OCT 05, 2007	Heidelberg, GERMANY	Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe		Tritium production rate; MCNP; Blanket neutronics experiment; FNS; FENDL; Angular distribution	SOLID BREEDER; WATER	A series of breeding blanket neutronics experiments were carried out with DT neutrons in the Japanese ITER test blanket module at JAEA Fusion Neutronics Source (FNS). and tritium production rates (TPRs) inside different blanket mock-ups were measured in detail. Most of calculations made using FENDL-2.1 and MCNP agreed well with the measured TPRs. On the other hand, there were overestimations of the calculation for the TPR in the experiment with a reflector and the TPR around the boundary between the rear part of the breeder layer and the beryllium in the pebble bed mock-up experiment. In this study, we investigated the possibility of improvement of the calculation by modifying the part of angular distributions in backward directions in FENDL-2.1. By uniformly decreasing the backward elastic scattering cross-sections of (56)Fe by 20% below the original data for incoming neutrons in the energy range from 0.5234 MeV up to 15.0 MeV, the overestimation of the calculations for the TPR in the enriched breeding blanket experiment with a reflector was reduced. Also, by uniformly decreasing the backward elastic scattering cross-sections of (9)Be by 20% and 30% below the original data for the incoming neutrons in the energy range from 0.93 MeV up to 14.94 MeV, and by 20% for those from 0.62 MeV up to 14.94 MeV, the overestimation of the calculations for the TPR around the boundary between the rear part of the breeder layer and the beryllium was lessened.

In the experiments, various sweep gases such as pure nitrogen gas, hydrogen/nitrogen gas and water vapor/nitrogen gas are used to investigate the effect of difference in sweep gas composition on tritium release form the breeder material. The experimental results indicate that almost all tritium was released as tritiated water vapor regardless of difference in gas composition of the sweep gas. Most of the chemical form of tritium released was tritiated water vapor even when the hydrogen/nitrogen gas was used for the sweep gas. It Was also found that a considerably smaller amount of tritium was released when a pure nitrogen gas was used as the sweep gas. Comparison of the experimental results reveals that the tritium release rate is substantially enhanced if the sweep gas contains water vapor. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A stainless steel cell formed by two independent volumes separated by a 2-mm thick nickel membrane is maintained at temperatures between 500 and 700 degrees C. A controlled amount of T-2 gas is flown in excess of argon in the source volume in contact with the bottom side of the nickel membrane,while a layer of mol ten salt is in con tact with the top side. The tritium permeating above the liquid surface is carried by an argon flow to a diagnostic system comprised of a quadrupole in ass spectrorneter, a gas chromatographer and a proportional counter. Tritium permeability in flibe as a function of temperature is determined by the measured permeation flow rates reached in steady-state conditions, while the diffusivity is determined by fitting the transient process with the analytical solution for the diffusion process. As a result, the solubility of tritium in flibe as a function of temperature is also determined. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Because of the double function of the blankets: breeding the necessary tritium and efficiently extracting the deposited heat, the metallic surfaces used to promote the heat transfer lead also to a non-negligible mass transfer of hydrogen isotopes. In order to improve the management of tritium, different studies have been launched in this field with applications to DEMO breeding blankets and to corresponding ITER TBM (test blanket module). A general model has been developed to evaluate the potential tritium released by permeation through hot walls up to the secondary circuit with the objective to define the possible ways to reduce the tritium release. For hot walls, Fick laws are written for hydrogen and tritium. A sensitivity study is done to determine which the major issues are and where the major reduction can be obtained for minimizing the final tritium release. It leads to determination of the key point where improvement could have a strong impact on the reduction of the tritium release. At present, permeation barrier are considered, but the chemistry control of helium coolant could have a stronger impact. This paper also presents what are the required further improvements of such modelling. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Tritium Confinement strategy of the Nuclear Buildings comprises key features of the atmosphere and vent detritiation systems and the heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. The designs developed during the ITER EDA (engineering design activities) for these systems need to be adapted to the specific conditions of the Cadarache site and modified to conform with the regulatory requirements applicable to installations nucleaires de base (INB) - basic nuclear installations - in France. The highest priority for Such adaptation has been identified as the Tritium Confinement of the Tokamak Complex and the progress in development of a robust, coherent design concept compliant with French practice is described in the paper.

In the Deuterium-Tritium Experiment (DTE1) about 30% oftritium fed to the tokamak was retained in the vessel and in-vessel components. It is expected that in a several years time]ET will cease experimental operations and enter a decommissioni ing phase. In situ detritiation of the vacuum vessel is likely to be needed prior to its dismantling. To reduce cost of subsequent storage and disposal, post-dismantling detritiation of components and waste will be needed. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, which operates the JET machine, has been carrying out studies of various detritiation techniques in order to select and experimentally prove technologies for in situ and ex situ detritiation of potential waste. This paper summarises the results. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Perevezentsev, A. N.; Bell, A. C.; Williams, J.; Brennan, P.

An experimental study has been carried out in order to determine the VDS catalyst ability to operate when exposed to the products of combustion released during a fire. In our tests the VDS catalytic recombiner has been tested in the presence of fumes generated by the combustion of selected materials (polyvinyl chloride, methyl methacrylate, vacuum pump oil and polytetrafluoroethylene). These materials have been burnt in an oven at 200 degrees C: the arising combustion fumes have been sent into a catalytic bed where a Pt 0.5% on alumina catalyst operated the conversion of the tritiated gases into tritiated water at 400 degrees C with a spatial velocity of 6000 h(-1). The catalyst efficiency has been assessed by adding tritium as a tracer to the combustion fumes entering the catalytic recombiner and measuring the activity of the tritiated water collected after this reactor. The studied catalyst has been mainly affected by the fumes coming from the combustion of polyvinyl chloride: the measured catalyst efficiency has been 86.7%. Especially, in this case the presence of chlorides Would have impaired the detritiation process by poisoning the catalyst. The combustion tests with methyl methacrylate and vacuum pump oil with polytetrafluoroethylene have shown slither reduced catalyst efficiencies of 91.1 and 93.5, respectively. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, the use of the refrigerant such as liquid nitrogen is the cause of long analysis time and is not suitable for easy installation. The development of the column material having separation capability at comparatively high temperature region is one of the solutions for these weak points. Mordenite (MOR) is a kind of a zeolite, and it has been reported that the separation column using MOR has possibility to separate hydrogen isotope mixture at comparatively high temperature. In this work, the separation columns using MOR were made and tested. The peaks of H(2) and D(2) were mostly separated at 144 K, but they were not separated at 195 K. MOR column adjusted in this work was still not for the practical use. However, this result suggests the possibility of the existence of the synthetic zeolite that can separate hydrogen isotope mixture at comparatively high temperature. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Abundances of chemical forms of tritium-molecular T(2) (44%). atomic T(0) (42%), and ionic T(+) (14%) and their distribution were determined in the plasma-exposed beryllium samples with lyomethods. Fast-electron radiation considerably increased the fractional tritium release at annealing by a factor of approximately 5. The magnetic field increased the fractional tritium release at annealing both without and under electron radiation by approximately 25%. Sorption of tritium in samples cut from an unused beryllium tile was investigated at about 1 Pa of T(2) at 773 K for 3 h both with and without simultaneous electron radiation and/or magnetic field. The amount of the tritium sorbed was found to be 3.3-6.2 kBq cm(-2). Most of the tritium sorbed was localized in subsurface layers up to a depth of 80 mu m of the beryllium samples.

Improved characteristics of hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene-platinum catalysts for tritium recovery from tritiated water	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 30-OCT 05, 2007	Heidelberg, GERMANY	Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe		Hydrophobic catalysts; Hydrogen isotopes separation		This paper presents recent results concerning a new preparation method and characteristics of the hydrophobic catalysts used in hydrogen isotopes separation. The objectives of the paper are: (I) to assess the current status and find a new procedure for the preparation of a new improved hydrophobic catalyst; (2) to improve the characteristics and performance of platinum hydrophobic catalysts. As a result of review of references it was concluded that platinum is one of the most active and efficient catalytic metal and polytetrafluoroethylene is a very good wet-proofing agent in the hydrogen isotopes separation processes. A category of newly improved hydrophobic Pt-catalysts has been proposed, prepared and characterized and are now under testing. The novelty consists in adding of metallic oxides (titanium dioxide, zirconium dioxide) as a new binding and wet-proofing agents. The added metallic oxides play a catalytic role, too. The physico-structural parameters of the improved catalyst have been determined and are discussed. Preliminary tests concerning the catalytic activity and stability in tritium separation process have been carried-out. The new proposal is a promising idea to improve the performance of conventional hydrophobic Pt-catalysts. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Bend points of hydrogen partial pressure curves obtained by tritium removal simulation tests	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 30-OCT 05, 2007	Heidelberg, GERMANY	Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe		Tritium cleanup system; Tritium removal simulation; Hydrogen partial pressure; Bend point	CLEANUP SYSTEM; EXHAUST-GAS; LHD	A tritium cleanup system has been developed for exhaust gases containing tritium in various chemical forms. This system is distinguished from conventional procedures in that tritium is removed as tritiated hydrogen molecules. Basically, the system consists of five main components, including a hydrogen separator and a decomposition-processing vessel. A previous study assumed that the gas for processing consisted of hydrogen, methane, and helium, with some proportion of tritiated hydrogen and methane. The performance of this tritium cleanup system was examined using a computer-based simulation. To monitor the removal of tritium from the exhaust gas, the partial pressures of the respective components were examined during processing. The curve for the partial pressure of hydrogen contains two clear bends. In the present study, the correspondence between these bend points and their time width and simulation condition was examined in relation to the hydrogen partial pressure curves obtained under 28 conditions, differing in component proportion and process gas volume. It was found that two bend points moved, depending on the process gas condition, and three patterns appeared for the hydrogen partial pressure curves. A mechanism was proposed for explaining the movement of the bend points and the three patterns. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A series of gamma-ray and electron beam irradiation tests on the Nafion (R) N117 ion exchange membrane (a key polymer in the SPE electrolyzer, beyond the ITER-WDS requirement (530 kGy)) indicated that the Nafion (R) N117 membrane had sufficient radiation durability (up to 1600kGy) with regard to the mechanical strength and the ion exchange capacity. To maintain the electrolysis function of the SPE cell up to 530 kGy, we suggest replacing the Teflon (R) insulator with a polyimide insulator. Any serious damage in the tensile strength of the Kapton' polyimide (up to 1500 kGy) was not observed during the gamma-ray irradiation tests. Regarding the rubber material selection for the O-ring seal, we observed that the VITON rubber swelling in the water kept the tensile strength value constant (up to 1500 kGy). Moreover organic elution was not observed in the water after irradiation. With regard to its stable tensile strength and negligible organic elution, VITON rubber is a suitable material for the C-ring seal. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To assess the performance of the hydrogen pump using CaZr(0.9)In(0.1)O(3-alpha) hydrogen extraction by water vapor electrolysis is demonstrated at a constant current in the temperature range from 873 to 1073 K. The hydrogen extraction rate reached 1.8cm(3)/min at 0.5 A and 973 K. The present cell exhibited mixed proton and electron hole conduction and the transport number of protons decreased at relatively high temperatures. This suggested that high temperatures are not required for a hydrogen pump operating under water vapor electrolysis conditions. Furthermore, as an initial feasibility study, a concentration test was performed on hydrogen gas using the closed loop system and hydrogen pump apparatus. It was found that the concentration rate of hydrogen in the closed loop reached five times that of water vapor in the anode compartment over a period of 50 min. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Although the radiative heat loss occupies a significant fraction of 12-25% of total decay heat depending on the configurations of the He loop and tritium inventories, its nearly linear behavior enables to produce a linear calibration curve which shows a deviation of up to 0.5 g of tritium at the given measurement points. The M-shaped configuration of the He loop having larger heat transfer area shows preferable performances over the U-shaped configuration in terms of the rapid measurement and accuracy.

The safe design and operation of tritium storage beds will be one of the most important points for enhancing overall safety in the facility. In the Tritium Process Laboratory at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency, many tritium storage beds with zirconium-cobalt (ZrCo) and uranium (U) have been used with/without self-accountancy measures, and 20 years of safe handling experience has been accumulated. From this experience, the key issues to be considered for the safety design are the effects of tritium decay, such as decay heat transfer and (3)He behavior, which can cause an increase in temperature and pressure in the tritide vessel, along with the normal protection against over-temperature, over-pressure and leaks in the metal-hydride bed. Concerning the safety operation, the key issues are the hydrogenation-dehydrogenation cycle sequence under the requirements of the storage system and the emergency action, such as rapid hydrogen recovery and loss of normal cooling function.

In order to validate this initial reference of the ZrCo hydride beds, the following heat analyses were performed: (i) heating performance of a ZrCo hydride packed bed during delivery operation, (ii) cooling performance (decay heat removal. etc.) to reduce the ZrCo hydride temperature during storage operation, (iii) thermal shielding performance for reduction of outer vessel surface temperature. The present paper provides the results of these heat analyses and discusses the effects of the endothermic and exothermic reactions (ZrCo + 1/2T(2) <-> ZrCoT + 80.5 kJ/mol (T(2))), and that of cooling by using He gas.

Kogel catalysts and Dixon gauze rings were mixed at a certain ratio and packed in the column homogeneously. A stage-wise model, named "Channeling stage model". was also developed to predict separative performances of the column. In order to design a LPCE column to be tested at the TLK experimental facility, we examined the effect of the catalyst packed ratio and the gas-liquid ratio on the separative performance of the column. The optimal value of the catalyst packed ratio was obtained to 30%. The specifications of the column and the operating conditions of the equipment were reported. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Two types of trickle beds were tested in our previous study. One was the layered bed, where layers of Kogel catalysts and Dixon gauze rings were alternately filled in the column. The other was the homogeneous bed, where Kogel catalysts and Dixon gauze rings were homogeneously mixed and filled in the column. We found that (1) the homogeneously packed bed was more efficient than the layered packed bed, and (2) the catalyst quantity was optimal, which resulted in the highest separative performance. In this study, the effect of the gas-liquid ratio (G/L) on the Optimum catalyst quantity was studied experimentally in a homogeneously packed bed. When the value of G/L was 1.7, total separation factors were relatively small and the optimum catalyst quantity could not be determined. On the other hand, when the values of G/L were 0.9 and 0.7, the values of the total separation factors had maximums and the optimal quantities of the catalyst were clearly obtained.

The plant was updated to provide high factor of heavy water detritiation. Detritiation factor of about 2000 was achieved and heavy water with reduced contents of tritium less than 10(5) Bq/kg was withdrawn at the rate of 7-9 kg/day as a top product. The experience gained during the plant operation shows the high efficiency of hydrogen isotope separation with CECE process.

Tritium safety consideration in the design of tritium systems for China HCSB and DFLL TBMs	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 30-OCT 05, 2007	Heidelberg, GERMANY	Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe		ITER; TBM; Tritium safety	PERMEATION BARRIERS; WATER; RECOVERY; BLANKET	The main goal of an international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER) test blanket module (TBM) is to test the feasibility of tritium production and extraction. China has designed two types of TBMs to put in a whole test port, which are the helium-cooled solid breeder (HCSB)TBM and the dual-function lithium lead (DFLL)TBM. A set of common tritium processing systems was designed for the two types of TBMs, including the tritium extraction system (TES), the helium coolant system and the coolant purification system (CPS). Tritium in the TBMs and the ancillary systems should be controlled for the sake of radiological safety. The design of a few key parameters, such as the partial pressures of tritium in the coolant and above the breeder, the flux of carrier gas for tritium extraction, the efficiency of tritium extraction. the selection of the structure material together with the surface coating, etc., depend on the structure of the TBMs and the control of tritium release into the environment. A set of calculation models, based on the tritium mass balance among the TBMs, and different ancillary systems were developed to appraise the tritium safety in the common tritium systems and the Chinese TBMs. A tritium permeation barrier coating on the structure material of some components, a double-wall design for some tritium containers, and the establishment of a glove-box atmosphere detritiation system (GDS) are all necessary to control the release of tritium into the environment.

Tritium processing systems for the helium cooled pebble bed test blanket module	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 30-OCT 05, 2007	Heidelberg, GERMANY	Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe		TBM; Tritium extraction; Coolant purification; Tritium processing		One of the most challenging issues for testing the different Test Blanket Modules (TBM) concepts in ITER is the demonstration of the ability to correctly and efficiently manage the bred tritium. For all TBM concepts the main auxiliary systems involved in this task are the Tritium Extraction System (TES), whose main purpose is to extract tritium from the breeder, making it available to the Tokamak Exhaust Processing system in the ITER Tritium Plant, and Coolant Purification System (CPS) which extracts the permeated tritium from He-coolant and keeps controlled the chemistry of the primary cooling circuit. Both these systems have to be compatible with: - the foreseen requirements from the TBM experimental campaign; - the ITER space requirements; - the requirements in terms of interface with the ITER Tritium Plant. In this paper, the composition and flow-rate of the gas stream to be processed by the tritium extraction system and coolant purification system in the Helium Cooled Pebble Bed Test Blanket Module is given for the high duty IDT phase of ITER. Moreover, in the light of the operative conditions planned for the experimental campaign on the HCPB-TBM, a preliminary design of the TES and CPS is presented and discussed, with a first estimation of the required space for their installation.

In this paper, the radiation damage behavior of various first wall materials (W-5Re, V-4Cr-4Ti and SiC/SiC composite) was investigated in the APEX blanket where a protective liquid wall of 75% LiF-23% ThF(4)-2% (233)UF(4) was considered. Tritium breeding potential of this salt with respect to the investigated structural materials was also examined in this blanket. Neutron transport calculations were carried out with the aid of the code, SCALE4.3 by solving the Boltzmann transport equation. Computations were performed with respect to the liquid wall thickness to determine the effective thickness satisfying both the radiation damage and the tritium breeding criteria. Numerical results showed that the flowing wall consisting of 75% LiF-23%ThF(4)-2% (233)UF(4) With a thickness of similar to 35 cm and similar to 50 cm would be required to extend the lifetime of the first wall to similar to 30 years and to supply sufficient tritium to the (DT) fusion driver for W-5Re and V-4Cr-4Ti, respectively whereas, SiC/SiC composite would require a flowing wall thickness of >60 cm to comply with both the damage and the tritium limits.

The system analysis code incorporates prospects of the development of plasma physics and the technologies in a simple mathematical model and it helps to develop the concept of a DEMO reactor and to identify the necessary R&D areas for a realization of the concept. With the system analysis code, we investigated the performance of a DEMO reactor with a He cooled molten lithium (HCML) blanket as a tritium breeding blanket. It is shown that to access an operation space for a high electric power and for a steady-state operation, developments of improved method in both plasma physics and technology to handle a high heat load to a divertor and to increase the current drive efficiency are required.

Lifetime performance analysis of HCPB power plant in-vessel components using HERCULES	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 30-OCT 05, 2007	Heidelberg, GERMANY	Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe		Power plant conceptual design; Engineering analysis; in-service/lifetime estimates	IRRADIATION CREEP	The PPCS plant models explore a range of physics and technology assumptions spanning from near-term, ITER-like assumptions to very advanced scenarios. Plant model B (PMB) employs a helium-cooled, pebble bed (HCPB) blanket concept. Creep, both thermal and irradiation, is the primary limiting mechanism for in-vessel component lifetime, with the bulk of cumulative damage due to the power-on period. Lifetime improvement is possible if the time-to-failure at the full power-on stress level can be extended, which can be achieved through geometrical shape optimization. Redesign of the in-vessel build could rely on a slimmer tritium generating blanket (similar to 40 cm) instead of similar to 50cm. with the first wall acting as a "shielding" blanket similar to 10cm thick. The concept relies on extending the first wall and breeding blanket lifetime significantly, by limiting creep and fatigue, without losing the breeding capability of tritium breeding ratio (TBR) > 1. HERCULES was used for a neutronics analysis and the extraction of engineering parameters. A comparison with previous creep-fatigue analyses of helium-cooled blankets and first walls show that this new concept is capable of substantially increased lifetime, with TBR similar to 1.0 (original TBR similar to 1.14). The concept needs further refinement and optimization, but it is promising to deliver not only engineering parameters but also economic performance. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Conceptual design of a component test facility based on the spherical tokamak	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 30-OCT 05, 2007	Heidelberg, GERMANY	Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe		Spherical tokamak; Component test facility	POWER-PLANT; PEBBLE DIVERTOR; FUSION POWER	A small steady state spherical tokamak (ST) offers an attractive system for producing simultaneously the neutron. particle and heat fluxes necessary to effectively test and optimise blanket modules, first wall structures and other components under the required fusion power plant conditions. This component test facility (CTF) would complement and extend the qualification of materials by IFMIF and could operate in association with DEMO thus reducing the risk of delays, and extending the options, during this crucial stage of the development of commercial fusion power. The ST-CTF offers many advantages including low tritium consumption, ease of maintenance and a compact assembly and would operate in a strongly driven mode in which Q similar to 1. The current drive would be provided by a mix of bootstrap current and neutral beam injection systems. The blanket modules under test are removed and replaced using a casking system and the entire centre column assembly can be relatively easily removed via a hydraulic lift system beneath the tokamak assembly. The single turn toroidal field coil has a water-cooled copper centre rod with multiple return limbs, which requires a low voltage, high current power supply. The poloidal field coils are also water-cooled but use a glass fibre reinforced cyanate ester resin insulation that offers higher radiation resistance and higher operating temperatures than the conventional epoxy resin systems. When operated in L-mode most of the exhaust power is directed to the outer legs of the double null divertor configuration where high power densities and high material erosion rates are developed. A novel divertor target based on the use of a cascading flow of pebbles is one option being developed for this application. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The tritium for maintaining the self-sustainable D-T fusion reaction is to be procured from the (n,t) reaction in the blanket. For this reason, neutronics analysis in the blanket design is indispensable. Especially for solid-type blanket design, neutronics analysis, including a depletion (transmutation) calculation, is required to calculate the neutron flux and tritium production rate more accurately. In eigenvalue problems for the fission reactor design, the MONTEBURNS code is widely used for depletion calculations. However, the fusion blanket design is a fixed source problem. In addition to this, the current version of the MONTEBURNS code does not include Be(9)(n,t)Li(7) and Li(7)(n,n't)alpha reactions. Thus, in this research, (I) the MONTEBURNS code will be modified to solve the fusion blanket problem, including Be(9)(n,t)Li(7) and Li(7)(n,n't)alpha reactions, and (2) a three-dimensional neutronics depletion analysis for a solid-type blanket for ITER will be performed using the modified MONTEBURNS code.

The static state neutronics analyses of a fusion power reactor (named FDS-II) have been carried out to find out the effects of the 1D/2D/3D geometric descriptions for computational models. The neutron wall loading distribution. tritium-breeding ratio and power density distribution are calculated to evaluate the nuclear performance using the Monte Carlo transport code MCNP4C and nuclear data library FENDL-2.1. Comparison of the results suggests that the value of TBR calculated by the 1 D approach overestimates the tritium-breeding ratio especially in the inner blanket. The power density distribution based on the 21) and 31) models were similar since they all consider the effects of the axial components. For obtaining global scalar quantities for general use, simplified models of the fusion reactor are usually sufficient. However, more calculations are needed to test the validity of each model in different regions of phase space. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Deceleration in a traveling wave direct energy converter for advanced fusion	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 30-OCT 05, 2007	Heidelberg, GERMANY	Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe		Direct energy conversion; Advanced fusion; TWDEC	SIMULATION; REACTOR	A traveling wave direct energy converter (TWDEC) is desirable for the direct energy conversion of fast protons produced by deuterium-helium-3 fusion, since the proton energy is so great that conventional electrostatic converters cannot be used. This paper presents the results of high-energy TWDEC simulation experiments as a follow-up to the previously reported proof-of-principle experiments for low energy. As the beam energy increases, the efficiency of energy recovery is expected to improve, and since the variation in the beam velocity becomes large, its effect cannot be neglected. The decelerator electrodes intervals were designed to take into account the velocity matching between the decelerated beam and the traveling wave. The variable intervals also dictate the small size of the hole in the electrode through which the beam passes. A more appropriate hole size results in deceleration efficiency over 20% for a unit wavelength. The effectiveness of the matching design was confirmed by the dependence of deceleration efficiency on the beam energy. The experimental scaling of the deceleration efficiency for a unit wavelength was extended to approach the level of a commercial-scale device. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A fusion-specific, unique approach is necessary and needs to be developed. Recycling of materials and clearance (i.e. declassification to non-radioactive material) are the two recommended options for reducing the amount of fusion waste, while disposal as low-level waste (LLW) could be an alternative route for specific materials and components. Both recycling and clearance criteria have been recently revised by national and international institutions. These revisions and their consequences are examined in this paper. It is also important to define processes and routes to avoid generating active waste from fusion as much as possible. Two ways are explored within the fusion community: first, to develop materials leading to low activation levels and avoiding the generation of long-lived radionuclides (this includes controlling the impurity content of the material); second, to develop suitable and reliable processes allowing either to clear or release as much material as possible (potentially after adequate treatment) or to recycle most of the remaining materials within the fusion and nuclear industry.

Characteristics of honeycomb catalysts for oxidation of tritiated hydrogen and methane gases	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 30-OCT 05, 2007	Heidelberg, GERMANY	Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe		Tritium; Safety; Air cleanup system; Honeycomb catalyst; Nuclear fusion facility	TRITIUM	For large volume air cleanup in a nuclear fusion facility, honeycomb catalysts offer a useful advantage in terms of their low-pressure drop. In the present study, characteristics of honey comb catalysts for oxidation of hydrogen and methane gases were examined. The catalysts used were cordierite or Al-Cr-Fe metal alloy honeycombs on whose surface the precious metals Pt or Pd were deposited. Experimental parameters were the weight ratio of precious metal, mesh density, and water vapor content of the processed gas. It was found that Pt was suitable for hydrogen oxidation and Pd for methane oxidation. The oxidation reaction rate depended mainly on the precious metal weight ratio but not significantly on mesh density, and increasing the moisture content decreased the oxidizing activity. These honeycomb catalysts could be used as a high-performance alternative to a conventional packed bed type of catalyst in air cleanup systems. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Several dedicated studies, involving in vitro and in vivo experiments on metal tritide and carbon tritide dust, have raised some concerns about the protection guidelines for workers exposed to tritiated dust, because they are based on the radiotoxicity of tritium in form of tritium gas (HT), tritiated water (HTO) or organically bound tritium (OBT). While the behaviour of HT, HTO and OBT in the human body is well understood, the same is not fully true for tritiated dust, because of the size distributions of the particles and the variety of base materials. The in vivo and in vitro studies on tritiated dust have shown the dependence of the tritium clearance and retention in the human body on the physico-chemical parameters (mainly the particle size and density). Some recent studies on JET dust relative to graphite and CFC dust have dealt with physico-chemical characterisation and with in vitro tritium dissolution studies. Some uncertainties still remain and further testing is necessary (in vitro and in vivo), restricting if possible the investigation to relevant parameters. In the working areas of ITER the radioactive dust concentration in air will be kept at a very low level. However, in the event of an accident, the atmosphere inside the buildings, including operative areas as well, might get contaminated with small amounts of tritiated dust and hence inhalation risks cannot be excluded. The present paper summarizes the results from previous investigations on the subject which are relevant in deriving sound dose conversion factors for tritiated dust. At the same time, it proposes a dose conversion factor for dust which is conservative in order to envelope all ITER relevant materials. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Activation and afterheat analyses for the HCPB test blanket module in ITER	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 30-OCT 05, 2007	Heidelberg, GERMANY	Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe		ITER; Test blanket module; MCNP calculations; Activation analysis		To provide a sound data basis for the safety analyses of the HCPB TBM system in ITER, the afterheat and activity inventories were assessed making use of a code system that allows performing 3D activation calculations by linking the Monte Carlo transport code MCNP and the fusion inventory code FISPACT through an appropriate interface. A suitable MCNP model of a 20 degrees ITER torus sector with an integrated TBM of the HCPB PI (plant integration) type in the horizontal test blanket port was developed and adapted to the requirements for coupled 3D neutron transport and activation calculations. Two different irradiation scenarios were considered in the coupled 3D neutron transport and activation calculations. The first one is representative for the TBM irradiation in ITER with a total of 9000 neutron pulses over a 3 (calendar) years period. The second (conservative) irradiation scenario assumes an extended irradiation time over the full anticipated lifetime of ITER. The radioactivity inventories. the afterheat and the contact gamma dose were calculated as function of the decay time. Data were processed for the total activity, afterheat and contact dose rates of the TBM, its constituting components and materials. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For the purpose of basic evaluation of source terms oil nuclear heating and radioactivity generation, distribution of neutron flux, tritium breeding ratio, nuclear heating, decay heat and induced activity of radioactive waste are calculated. For the purpose of occupational radiological exposure evaluation, radiological isotope (RI) inventories. i.e., tritium in the breeder pebble bed, tritium ill purge gas, permeated tritium in cooling system and active corrosion product (ACP) in the cooling system, are estimated. Failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) has been carried out for identification of the postulated initiating events (PIEs) that need safety evaluation. The PIEs are Summarized into three groups, i.e., release of RI, pressurization and heatup. With respect to PIEs about release of RI, the maximum released RI is evaluated for three RI inventories. i.e., RI in vacuum vessel (VV) (tritium and radioactive dust), RI in purge gas (tritium) and RI in coolant (tritium and ACP). With respect to the PIEs about pressurization, the maximum pressures of the compartments nearby the pipes of cooling system are evaluated. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The sub-module will have its own FW and structural container box that houses the breeder and beryllium pebble bed units, arranged in an edge-on-configuration. Low activation ferritic steel (F82H) is used as the structure and helium is used as a coolant. The breeder beds are made of Li(2)TiO(3) pebbles in which lithium has been enriched up to 75% in Li-6. Pulsed operation mode is assumed. During operation in the D-T phase, the total heating rate in the TBM is similar to 263 kW. The total amount of tritium generated in the breeder and the beryllium multiplier is similar to 9 g and 0.07 g, respectively, after reaching the 0.3 MWa/m(2) fluence limit. At shutdown, the total radioactivity and decay heat levels are similar to 0.89 MCi and similar to 0.002 MW. respectively. These values drop sharply after 1 min to similar to 0.098 MCi and similar to 0.0006 MW. The contribution from the F82H structure is the dominant one up to similar to 10 years following shutdown. After similar to 10 years, the contribution to the total activation and decay heat from the breeder material is the dominant one due to the generated tritium. The WDR of various components are far below unity and thus are well within ITER regulatory guidelines. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
