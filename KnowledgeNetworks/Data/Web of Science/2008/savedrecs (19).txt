Measurement comparisons of radioactivity among European monitoring laboratories for the environment and food stuff	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th International Conference on Radionuclide Metrology and Its Applications (ICRM 2007)	SEP 03-07, 2007	Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICA	Natl Metrol Inst S Africa, iThemba Lab Accelerator Based Sci			EFFICIENCY	For more than 15 years, European Union (EU) laboratories monitoring environmental radioactivity have been obliged to participate in measurement comparisons organised by the European Commission. After a short review of comparisons conducted during the 1990s, the approach of IRMM organising these comparisons since 2003 is presented. It relies on the provision of comparison samples with reference values traceable to the International Reference System for radionuclides (SIR). The results of the most recent comparison, the determination of K-40, Sr-90 and Cs-137 in milk powder, are presented. The influence of repetitive participation in measurement comparisons on laboratory performance is studied on the basis of data from more than 20 laboratories having participated in several exercises during the last 15 years.

Different experimental tests have been conducted with a point source, progressively reducing the matter around the radioactive deposit, to investigate the origin and characteristics of the different spectrum components due to scattered photons (bumps). These tests were completed by Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, a peak-shape calibration was performed using several radionuclides (Cd-109, Am-241, Ba-133, Cs-137 and Eu-152). This allowed in identifying the main contributions to the bumps and improving the spectra processing. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Plagnard, J.; Hamon, C.; Lepy, M.

Together with Kr-85 and Xe-133, the radionuclide Ar-41 is measured using HPGe detectors and its activity is determined using a gamma-ray peak at 1293 keV. The counting efficiency used in these measurements was calculated by the Monte Carlo method using the MCNP code. Radioactive gas standard is prepared by irradiation of argon in a high-pressure vessel by a Cf-252 neutron generator. The inner shape and thickness of the cylinder walls were determined by radiography. The argon volume under normal conditions is determined from the high-pressure vessel volume and by a precise gas pressure measurement. As a result, the activity concentration of Ar-41 at normal conditions is certified. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Low activities of Pu-238, Am-241, Cm-243 and Cm-244 were determined by measuring thin sources, made from the original solution, in a high-resolution alpha-particle spectrometer. The sources were prepared by evaporating the plutonium solution on quartz plates in a vacuum chamber. From the ingrowth of Am-241 in the original solution, the amount of Pu-241 could be calculated. After radiochemical separation of Am-241, the plutonium was measured by high-efficiency alpha-particle spectrometry to determine the amount of Pu-238. The enriched Pu-240 material was also measured by high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometry, using two different HPGe detectors to determine the impurities of Pu-239 and Am-241. The preparation of the sources and the measurement methods are described and discussed. The measured impurities, given in % of the Pu-240 activity, are compared with the values on the certificate.

These samples have significant shielding effects. In order to study whether the background sources in three ultra low-background HPGe detectors were located in the detector or in the shield, Marinelli beakers filled with hyperpure mercury were measured.

Optimization of sampling and counting times for gamma-ray spectrometric measurements of short-lived gamma-ray emitters in aqueous samples	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th International Conference on Radionuclide Metrology and Its Applications (ICRM 2007)	SEP 03-07, 2007	Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICA	Natl Metrol Inst S Africa, iThemba Lab Accelerator Based Sci			CURRIE	A method to determine the optimal sampling and counting regimes for water monitoring is presented. It is assumed that samples are collected at a constant rate. The collection time is followed by a sample preparation time that is proportional to the sample quantity collected, and then by the counting time. In the optimal regime these times are chosen in such a way that the minimum detectable concentration is the lowest. Two cases are presented: the case when the background originates from the spectrometer background, which is constant in time and independent of the sample properties, and the case when the background originates from the radioactivity present in the sample.

The spectrometer consists of a low-background high-purity germanium detector with a relative efficiency of 120% and various shielding devices to reduce radiation background. The cabinet-shaped device made of 10 ton of shielding materials encloses the germanium detector for protection against background from natural radioactivity and neutrons. Three plates of 50-mm-thick plastic scintillation detectors on top of the passive shielding cabinet suppress cosmogenic background by detecting high-energetic cosmic rations bombarding the germanium detector. The measured background rate of the spectrometer for the energy range 50-3000 keV was 1.72s(-1). (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Lee, K.

Using a new multiparameter digital counting system, spurious or afterpulses that contribute to background were identified by their pulse waveform and by a special event indicator defined by the time (< 2000 mu s) between two successive pulses. With the GPC in coincidence with a low-background NaI(Tl) scintillation guard detector, the weighted mean and standard uncertainty anticoincidence counts per day (d(-1)) was 6.2 +/- 0.4 d(-1).

It has been built with the aim of combining good counting efficiencies, low uncertainties and flexibility of operation. The distance between source and detector can be changed in a continuous way with a precision guide and a ball screw from 8 to 19 cm, which correspond to counting efficiencies between 0.023 and 0.004 for small size sources. A linear encoder allows the accurate determination of the source position. Alpha spectra of the sources are measured with an implanted silicon detector with an active area of 2000 mm(2). Uncertainties, excluding counting statistics, are below 0.1%. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this technique, the beta-detector is composed of two thin plastic scintillators sandwiching the source, coupled with a slender photomultiplier tube. The beta-detector part with the source was inserted into a large well-type NaI(Tl) scintillation detector for gamma-ray detection, making a 4 pi beta-4 pi gamma coincidence counting system. In this work, positron particles were detected with high efficiency in the beta-channel and annihilation quanta were also detected with high efficiency in the 4 pi gamma channel. The very small inefficiency of the 4 pi(beta + gamma) integral counter for the beta-plus branch has been confirmed by EGS5 Monte Carlo simulation.

The comparison solutions were prepared from a single master stock solution and distributed to the participating laboratories, who measured the activity concentration of the solution using either the laboratory's radionuclide activity calibrator or primary standardization methods. From the 7 results received, a Comparison Reference Value was calculated to be 37.35(78) M Bq g(-1) at the reference time. Degrees of equivalence, as defined by the Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) of the Comite International des Poids et Mesures (CIPM), were calculated for each laboratory, demonstrating that equivalence to within +/- 4% could be achieved. The comparison has been registered as a supplementary comparison with the CIPM, Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation, Section II-measurement of radionuclides (CCRI(II)) for the purposes of allowing the participants to establish traceability to international standards for this radionuclide.

Calibration of a radionuclide calibrator system as a Bulgarian standard for activity	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th International Conference on Radionuclide Metrology and Its Applications (ICRM 2007)	SEP 03-07, 2007	Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICA	Natl Metrol Inst S Africa, iThemba Lab Accelerator Based Sci		radionuclide calibrator; activity; calibration; radionuclide efficiency; energy-dependent efficiency; quality assurance in nuclear medicine		A commercially available radionuclide calibrator of the type Curiementor 3 (PTW, Freiburg, Germany) was calibrated using activity standard solutions, from the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), of a number of photon-emitting radionuclides, in particular those used in nuclear medicine: F-18, Cr-51, Ga-67, Tc-99m, In-111, I-123, I-125, I-131, Re-186, Tl-201, and for beta-emitting nuclides: P-32, Sr-89, Y-90, Tl-204. An energy-dependent efficiency curve was established to calculate efficiencies for photon-emitting radionuclides. The differences between experimental and calculated radionuclide efficiencies of the measuring system are of the order of a few percent. The performance of the system was checked for instrument stability, using a long-lived Cs-137 source, and for linearity using the decay of a Tc-99m source. The calibration measurements were carried out with 2 g of solution in standard PTB-type glass ampoules. The dependence of efficiency with varying solution mass and changing ampoule geometry is studied for some of the radionuclides. For example, geometry correction factors are determined for various solution volumes or ampoules with different wall thickness. The measuring system will enable the National Centre of Metrology (NCM) of Bulgaria to provide calibration services for activity measurements, which are traceable to PTB standards, and to organize national comparisons in order to improve the quality of measurements for nuclear medicine in Bulgarian hospitals. Furthermore, it should enable NCM to declare Calibration and Measurement Capabilities (CMCs) and to submit radioactive solutions to the International Reference System (SIR) at the BIPM in order to compare the results with Key Comparison Reference Values (KCRVs).

Quality audit programmes for radioactivity measurements of I-131 have been ongoing and the 12th audit was recently conducted among seventy nuclear medicine centres (NMC) in India. An audit for the activity measurements of Tc-99m was conducted for the first time among ten NMCs in Mumbai, India. These programmes for radioactivity measurements have become very important to establish traceability of measurements to national and international standards and ensure accurate calibration of radionuclide calibrators. The results of both the audits are very encouraging. Ninety-four percent of the NMCs for I-131, activity measurements were within a window of +/- 10% and for Tc-99m one NMC was deviating more than +/- 10%. The methodology adopted for the audit and results are discussed in detail in this paper. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Joseph, Leena; Anuradha, R.; Kulkarni, D.

Radioactivity determination of individual radionuclides in a mixture by liquid scintillation spectra deconvolution	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th International Conference on Radionuclide Metrology and Its Applications (ICRM 2007)	SEP 03-07, 2007	Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICA	Natl Metrol Inst S Africa, iThemba Lab Accelerator Based Sci		liquid scintillation counting; radioactivity; nuclear metrology; certified reference materials	COUNTING EFFICIENCY; EMITTERS	A spectrum deconvolution method has been applied to logarithmic liquid scintillation spectra containing more than one radionuclide, to determine the activity of the individual components. The shape of the sample spectrum has been used for resolving the various components in the sample by fitting the reference spectrum of each component to the measured composite spectrum. The procedure has been applied to environmental samples containing Sr-90, Y-90 and Sr-85, added as a tracer for the chemical recovery determination. Comparisons are made with results obtained using a modified window-based method and results obtained by measuring the Sr-85 activity by gamma-ray spectrometry and subtracting its contribution to the LS count rate. It is demonstrated that this treatment of the beta-particle spectra represents a rapid and reliable method of determining these radionuclides in a mixture, even at low activity levels.

Process resulting in the destruction of the No. 4 unit reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The results of an investigation of structural fragments of the core of the destroyed reactor in the No. 4 unit of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant are analyzed. It is shown on the basis of investigations of the fission product distribution over the cross-section of the graphite blocks and the determination of the physical properties of graphite that the temperature of the graphite blocks, including the reflector, at the moment they were ejected from the core exceeded 1000 degrees C. The heat content of the fuel was estimated on the basis of an analysis of fragments of the dispersed uranium dioxide particles and an analysis of possible graphite dispersal mechanisms at the moment of the explosion. It is shown that energy sufficient for dispersing and partial vaporization of the fuel and for dispersing the graphite could have been introduced into the fuel during the accident process. Analysis confirms the possibility of a core destruction scenario with ejection from the shaft and ejection of part of the fuel in the form of vapor and dispersed particles into the atmosphere.

Effect of the salt melt composition, temperature, and interaction time on the contact exchange reaction in the MCl-PbCl2-MeN systems	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article							ZIRCONIUM NITRIDE	The interaction of titanium, zirconium, and aluminum nitrides with a mixture of fused alkali-metal chlorides with lead chloride at 870-1070 K is studied. It is shown that as a result of the contact exchange interaction, which occurs in no more than 5 h, a large fraction of the powdered nitrides transforms into a soluble state, and lead precipitates in a metallic form. The same behavior is also characteristic for compact hot-pressed samples of nitrides. The method proposed for transferring insoluble nitrides into a state which is soluble in salt systems can be used to recover mixed uranium-plutonium mononitride fuel and to fractionate fission products into high-, medium-, and low-level radioactive wastes.

Simulation of neutron-physical processes in the surface layer of a fuel kernel	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								A large change in the structure, density, and chemical and phase composition occurs in nuclear fuel with deep burnup, and an edge zone is formed. Simulation of the formation of an edge zone in a fuel kernel of thermal reactors will make it possible to suggest ways to decrease its influence on the characteristics of a fuel element. In the present work, the neutron-physical processes occurring in the peripheral layer of a fuel kernel are simulated. The distribution of nuclear reaction rates along the radius of a fuel pellet is calculated using the SCALE-4.3, MCNP-4B, and UNK computer programs. The radial dependence of the local breeding ratio is calculated. It is shown that for fresh fuel BR > 1 for fissile nuclei in a 100 mu m thick layer, while the initial BR averaged over a pellet is no more than 0.5. The volume energy distribution in a 100 mu m thick peripheral layer is 30% higher than the average value over a pellet. A combined pellet, where the central part possesses the standard enrichment (4-5% U-235) and the peripheral layer contains less than 0.7% U-235, is proposed to decrease the influence of the edge zone on the properties of fuel.

A precondition for granting such a licence is an opinion by the Commission according to Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty. To this end, general data relating to the release of radioactive substances for normal operation and in case of accidents via the air and water must be supplied to the Commission. It can be demonstrated that all releases were very clearly below the limits set for the protection of the population (0.3 mSv) in the EU Member States during dismantling of the FRJ-2 research reactor, in some cases by several powers of ten. It will be therefore practically impossible to measure any radiological impacts resulting from normal dismantling operations. In order to assess any impacts as a consequence of an accident a dose was calculated for the national border closest to the reactor. Even the limit of 1 mSv (Section 46 German Radiation Protection Ordinance (StrlSchV), Article 13 of the EU Directive 96/29/Euratom), which applies to normal operation, is not exceeded at the national boundary in the case of an accident during dismantling work. In order to avoid a duplication of procedures in considering possible impacts on neighbouring countries by implementing licensing procedures in parallel to an "Article 37 procedure", attention is drawn to the environmental impact assessment (EIA) pursuant to the legislation on environmental impact assessments as part of the licensing procedure. A transfrontier participation of the authorities and public must in any case be implemented here if a project may have a considerable impact on the environmental assets of another country. Therefore, an amendment of the Recommendation on the application of Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty concerning a simple reporting requirement for small impact projects and projects where a transfrontier participation already is implemented according to Council Directive 85/337/EEC is suggested.

Impact on actinide arisings in the German reactor park of various fuel cycle options	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								On the basis of the legally stipulated total volume of electricity to be generated in Germany an estimate is given of the amounts of residues arising from reactor operation in terms of spent uranium fuel, plutonium, and minor actinides. Various idealized scenarios are considered as limiting criteria and compared with a realistic scenario in an attempt to show the impacts of various fuel cycle options on the remaining plant life. The case of plutonium reduction by using mixed oxide (MOX) fuels is analyzed in particular. While consistent direct disposal at the end of plant life leaves approx. 160 t of plutonium (upper bound), this quantity can be reduced by some 40 t merely by recycling once. Recycling twice could reduce the amount of plutonium by nearly 60 t (lower bound). Present boundary conditions already reduce the remaining amount of plutonium by some 17 t, which level could be raised to something close to the possible value of 40 t by resuming reprocessing. An additional scenario considered are the impacts on actinide production of plant life extension for all scenarios as a basis for future discussions of the kind already going on in other countries.

Evaluation of sprayable fixatives on a sandy soil for potential use in a dirty bomb response	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						terrorism; radiation protection; radioactivity; removal of; surface contamination	RADIOLOGICAL DISPERSAL DEVICE; SITE RESTORATION; CLEANUP; TERRORISM; RADIATION; EMULSIONS; SURFACE; ATTACK; EVENT	After the events of 11 September 2001, the possibility of a dirty bomb being detonated within the United States seems more realistic. Development of tools for use in response to a dirty bomb detonation has become a topic of both discussion and research. While if has been reported that the health risk to the public from such an event would likely be small, it is thought that the psychological impact could be considerable. One response option that has been considered is adapting sprayable solutions for the purpose of fixing contamination in place, thereby limiting the spread of contamination by wind and rain and facilitating subsequent cleanup. This work evaluated two commercially available particle fixatives (IsoFIX-HT and IsoFIX-RC) for their effectiveness in preventing dispersal of simulated contamination. Nonradioactive cesium chloride and cobalt oxide particles were selected as the simulated contamination and applied to the surface of three outdoor test plots. Two test plots were treated with fixatives; the third plot provided a control. Samples were collected over 95 days to observe changes in tracer concentration on the surface of the test plots. One fixative (IsoFIX-RC) effectively held the tracer in place with no net loss of tracer, while the other fixative (IsoFIX-HT) had no impact on the loss of tracer relative to the control. Under the conditions tested, IsoFIX-RC appears capable of fixing surface contamination in place for at least several months.

The effect of manufacturing variables on radiation doses from porcelain tiles	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						dose assessment; gamma radiation; naturally occurring radionuclides; radiation protection	BUILDING-MATERIALS; NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; TRACK DETECTORS; RADON; EXHALATION; PARAMETERS; PRODUCTS; RATES	Previous studies have focused on the radiological properties of glazed ceramic tiles. This study was conducted to describe the radiological properties of porcelain tiles and how they were affected by variations in the manufacturing parameters. The data showed that the majority of the uranium in the tiles was attributable to the addition of zircon while less than half of. the thorium in the tiles was attributable to the added zircon, and the remainder came from other minerals in the formulation. The effects of firing temperatures and compressive strengths of the tiles are presented and show that higher firing temperatures increase radon emanation, while higher compressive strengths reduce radon emanation. The study also described how the addition of zircon to the tile formulation affected the radiological exposures that could be received by a member of the public from the use of such porcelain tiles. A dose assessment was conducted based on 23 different types of tile formulation. Screening procedures for building materials have been described in European Commission documents, and these limit the addition of zircon in a porcelain tile to similar to 9% by mass.-The dose assessment reported in this study showed that 20% zircon could be added to a porcelain tile without exceeding the prescribed dose limits.

An assessment of natural radioactivity of soils and its external radiological impact in southwestern Nigeria	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						environmental assessment; environmental impact; naturally occurring radionuclides; radiation protection	VEGETATION; CS-137; ROCKS	Soil samples collected from five states in the southwestern part of Nigeria have been analyzed for activity concentration of gamma-ray emitters. The States were Oyo, Lagos, Ondo, Ogun, and Osun. Activity concentration measurement was carried out using a co-axial type high purity germanium (HPGe) detector. Spectral analyses were performed using spectrometry software. The activity concentration measured ranged from 0.03 +/- 0.2 Bq kg(-1) for Cs-137 to 1,358.6 +/- 28.5 Bq kg(-1) for K-40. K-40 accounted for most of the activity. The calculated absorbed dose rates in air at 1.0 m above the ground ranged from 6 to 303 nGy h(-1) with a mean and standard deviation of 60.5 nGy h(-1) and 63.2 nGy h(-1), respectively. Estimated annual outdoor effective dose equivalent varied from 8 to 370 mSv y(-1). The calculated collective dose equivalent values for the five states ranged from 87,000 person-Sv to 600,000 person-Sv. The estimated annual outdoor effective values were considerably higher than the world soil average value of 70 mu Sv y(-1) reported by the International Commission on Radiological Protection.

The accident at Chernobyl in 1986 also contributed to the fallout in some locations. The Cs-137 activity concentration from fallout has been measured as a function of depth in soil samples from five different locations across Nebraska. Soil samples 2-cm thick down to a depth of 30 cm were collected in Brown, Dawes, Lancaster, Red Willow, and Thurston Counties. Samples taken from each of the sites were dried, sieved, and counted using an HPGe gamma spectroscopy system to measure the activity concentration of Cs-137 at each depth in the soil. Activity concentrations as high as 216 Bq kg(-1) were measured in the samples. Dry soil bulk densities were calculated for each site based on soil type and used to calculate the area density of deposition. Area deposition densities up to 13,100 Bq m(-2) were measured, consistent with published estimates.

The crystals, grown by Cermet, Inc., using an oxygen-pressurized melt-growth process, were doped with Group I elements (Li), Group 2 elements (Mg), Group 3 elements (Ga, In) and Lanthanides (Gd, Er, Tm). The goals of these studies are to better understand the scintillation mechanisms associated with various members of the ZnO scintillator family and to then use this knowledge to improve the radiation detection capabilities of ZnO-based scintillators. One application for which ZnO is particularly well suited as a scintillator is as the associated particle detector in a deuterium-tritium (D-T) neutron generator. Application requirements include the exclusion of organic materials, outstanding timing resolution, and high radiation resistance. ZnO:Ga and ZnO:In have demonstrated fast (subnanosecond) decay times with relatively low light yields, and ZnO(Ga) has been used in a powder form as the associated particle detector for a D-T neutron generator. Four promising candidate materials, ZnO, ZnO:Ga, ZnO:In,Li, and ZnO:Er,Li, were identified in this study. These four samples demonstrated sub-nanosecond decay times and alpha-particle-excited-luminescence comparable to BC-400 fast plastic scintillator. The ZnO:Mg,Ga, ZnO:Gd, and ZnO:Li samples demonstrated appreciable slow (microsecond) decay components that would be incompatible with high-counting-rate applications.

Those are exposed to mixed neutron-gamma fields. An effective suppression of signals due to gamma interactions with the scintillator or the PD bulk material is of major importance since neutron alarms in RIID are triggered by a few single neutron counts; any gamma signal not rejected may generate a false neutron alarm. Measurements demonstrated that digital signal processing combined with simultaneous pulse height and pulse shape analysis can provide efficient neutron-gamma discrimination. The results were obtained with a compact, basic detector configuration and sampling rates of only 10 MS/s. Such systems can be realized with state-of-the-art miniaturized electronics.

The crystals were cut into a size of 5 x 10 x 10 mm(3). The X-ray diffraction technique was used to verify the structure of crystals. The emission spectra were measured with X-ray excitation at room temperature. Scintillation properties of the crystals such as pulse height spectra, energy resolution, alpha/beta ratio, relative light output, proportionality, and fluorescence decay time were measured with the various radioactive gamma sources at room temperature. The light output of these crystals were compared with that of the CsI(Tl) crystal. The differences in relative light outputs, energy resolutions, and decay times among these crystals were studied in detail.	[Kim, Jungin; Kang, Heedong; Kim, H.

Growth of ZnWO4 crystal scintillators for high sensitivity 2 beta experiments	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Inorganic Scintillators and their Applications	JUN 04-08, 2007	Winston Salem, NC	IEEE		double beta decay; scintillation detectors; tungsten compounds; zinc compounds	DOUBLE-BETA DECAY; SINGLE-CRYSTALS; SPECTROSCOPIC PROPERTIES; SEARCH; IMPURITIES; ABSORPTION	Large volume zinc tungstate crystal scintillators (up to 50 mm in diameter and 100 mm length) with improved energy resolution were developed as result of advances in crystal growth. The energy resolution of one-centimeter cube ZnWO4 crystals showed energy resolution in the range 8-10% for 662 keV gamma line of Cs-137.

Large volume CaMoO4 scintillation crystals	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Inorganic Scintillators and their Applications	JUN 04-08, 2007	Winston Salem, NC	IEEE		scintillation detectors; crystal growth; neutrinos		Several scintillation CaMoO4 crystals with size up to 28 x 28 x 220 mm(3) were grown by Czochralski method. Their scintillation properties have been evaluated. Light yield of full size crystals measured with XP2020 PMT is about 4% relative to small reference CsI(Tl) crystal. Radio luminescence spectrum under gamma-excitation contains single emission peak with maximum at 520 nm. Optical transmission spectra contain weak absorption band around 420 nm, which has almost no influence on scintillation light. This allows to produce even larger scintillation elements without deteriorating the light yield. Scintillation kinetics was measured under gamma- and alpha-particle excitation both in fast (2000 ns) and slow (200 mu s) time scales. Fast components-12 ns, (0.1%); 200 ns (0.5%) were detected along with slow-3.8 mu s (3.4%); 20 mu s (96 %)-components. Difference in fast component contribution under gamma and alpha excitation allows to implement pulse-shape discrimination of alpha-radioactive background coming from impurities in the crystals.

Mobile-Dose gives a constant measurement of the dose during the filling of vials or syringes, triggering the end of the filling process based on a predefined dose limit. Several applications of Mobile-Dose have been delivered worldwide, from Italian hospitals and clinics to European and Japanese ones. The design of such an instrument and its integration in robotic machineries, was required by an Italian company specialised in radiation protection tools for nuclear applications, in the period 2001-2003. At the time of its design, apparently no commercial instruments with a suitable interfacing capability to the external world existed: we designed it in order to satisfy all the strict requirements coming from the medical aspects (precision within 10%, repeatability, stability, time response) and from the industrial conceiving principles that are mandatory to ensure a good reliability in such a complicated environment. The instrument is suitable to be used in standalone mode too, thanks to its portability and compactness and to the intelligent operator panel programmed for this purpose.

The framework consists of two main parts, the alpha-particle energy deposition profile (ADEP) and a lumped parameter equivalent circuit model describing the nipi device operation. Experimental measurements are used to verify the ADEP modeling approach which determines the spatially varying energy deposited within the device. Using these results, nipi-diode radioisotope batteries are simulated and the effect of the number of junctions, the thickness of the junction, and the alpha-particle flux on output voltage and power are investigated. The modeling results indicate that a 1 cm(2) bi-layer device (consisting of one source and two adjacent nipi-diodes) with a source activity of 300 mCi can reach a power output of 2 mW, excluding radiation damage effects.

The main advantage of this detector system is the ability to perform primary standardizations without the need for a coating of a metal layer on the radioactive source film for rendering it conductive, as usually necessary for proportional counter measurements. The measurements were also performed with a conventional 4 pi(PC)beta - gamma coincidence system, which makes use of a 4 pi proportional counter for charged particles or X-ray detection coupled to a pair of NaI(T1) scintillation counters. The gamma-ray window was set to measure the 511 keV gamma-rays produced by positron annihilation. The detector efficiency was changed by moving the electronic discriminator threshold. The observed activity values were extrapolated to 100 % efficiency and the results showed good agreement between the two detector systems.

J	Slough, J				Slough, John			Suitability of small scale linear systems for a fission-fusion reactor, breeder, and waste transmutation	JOURNAL OF FUSION ENERGY			English	Article						fusion; hybrid reactor; field reversed configuration	HYBRID	To date the magnetic fusion effort has been almost entirely devoted to only one application, that being a multi gigawatt central station electric plant. Given the already well established fission based industry, the likelihood that fusion will have any impact on curbing the current carbon-based energy demand in the 21st century is slim. This paper advocates that the first and primary use of fusion neutrons should be as the driver for a sub-critical fission nuclear energy system-a fission-fusion hybrid reactor. This system can also be utilized to transmute long-lived radioactive wastes, and breed fissile nuclear fuel for several additional fission reactors. A small-scale fusion system based on a reciprocating fusion cycle employing the magneto-kinetic compression of the Field Reversed Configuration (FRC) is particularly well suited for this application. The characteristics of this fusion neutron driver and the potential for transmutation of long-lived nuclear wastes and breeding of fissile nuclear fuel in a blanket are presented.

J	[Anonymous]				[Anonymous]			Effects of sputtering of and radiation by aluminum on magnetized target fusion plasmas	JOURNAL OF FUSION ENERGY			English	Article						sputtering; radiation; magnetized target fusion; coronal model		We estimate numerically the rate of radiation by aluminum impurities for parameters relevant to magnetized target fusion (MTF) plasmas. We demonstrate that the coronal equilibrium is appropriate for expected MTF plasma parameters. Using the coronal equilibrium, we estimate the power radiated per impurity ion is 0.25-0.5 x 10(-16) MW for temperatures and densities relevant to present plasma parameters taken from the FRX-L experiment at Los Alamos National Laboratory and is approximately 75.0 x 10(-16) MW for temperatures and densities relevant to anticipated MTF plasmas. We calculate the sputtering rate of aluminum by thermal deuterium and tritium plasma ions is a few percent assuming an impact angle of 45. Finally, we estimate that with aluminum impurity levels of a few percent, the impurity radiation power density would be approximately 25 kW/cm(3) for FRX-L conditions and 2.5 GW/cm(3) for anticipated conditions in a MTF plasma. While we have assumed a sputtering model of impurity generation, the results for the power density apply for impurity levels of a few percent, regardless of the generation mechanism.									0	0	0	0	1	SPRINGER	NEW YORK	233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA	0164-0313			J FUSION ENERG	J.

This reprocessing system is based on experimental evidence indicating that Pu(VI) in a nitric acid solution is co-crystallized with uranyl nitrate, whereas it is not crystallized when uranyl nitrate is not present in the solution. The system consists of five steps: dissolution of spent fuel, Pu oxidation, U-Pu co-crystallization, re-dissolution of the crystals, and U re-crystallization. The proposed system does not require the use of organic solvents, resulting in a relative increase in safety and cost-effectiveness. The system requires recycling of the mother liquor from the U-Pu co-crystallization step to recover almost the entire amount of U and Pu at this step. The appropriate recycling ratio is determined, such that satisfactory decontamination is achieved. A consistent ratio of Pu to U in the mother liquor from the U re-crystallization is maintained by regulating the temperature, suggesting that the quality of the liquor, which can be a source of mixed oxide fuels, can be controlled despite differences in the composition of the spent fuel. The size of a plant utilizing the proposed system is estimated to be about 30% less than that of the PUREX system.

J	Sasaki, T; Gunji, Y				Sasaki, Tomozo; Gunji, Yasuyoshi			High radon emanation coefficients of porous matters produced through filtration and precipitation	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						radon emanation; radon emanation coefficient; uranium-bearing waste; naturally occurring radioactive material	SOILS	Previous theoretical predictions of high radon emanation coefficients were verified in experiments using porous matters artificially produced through filtration and precipitation. Such porous matters were prepared by replicating uranium-bearing waste generating processes used in fuel fabrication facilities in Japan except that radium was employed instead of uranium. In the replication, a liquid containing a trace amount of naturally occurring radium was processed by filtration or precipitation, resulting in radium adsorption on the surfaces of the matrices used as agents for the processing. The matrices were diatomaceous earth for filtration and iron (III) hydroxide for precipitation. Radon emanation coefficients of these matrices were measured and proved to be very high as expected from the authors' previous theoretical calculations which predicted that chemical procedures like filtration or precipitation could lead to very high radon emanation coefficients. Filtration and precipitation are the most common processes employed in chemical industries. Therefore, the present study also provides important information on radon emanation coefficients for workers in those chemical industries which handle substances containing naturally occurring radium. The findings further imply that man-made artificial industrial products containing naturally occurring radium should be distinguished from ubiquitous minerals, rocks and soils containing naturally occurring radium from a radiological exposure viewpoint, because the radon emanation coefficients of the former are generally higher than those of the latter.

J	Iwai, Y; Yamanishi, T				Iwai, Yasunori; Yamanishi, Toshihiko			Influence of framework silica-to-alumina ratio on the tritiated water adsorption and Desorption characteristics of NaX and NaY Zeolites	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						fusion; tritium; tritiated water; fixed-bed; adsorption; desorption; isotope separation; zeolite; silica-to-alumina ratio; NLDFT	TEMPERATURE-PROGRAMMED DESORPTION; POROSITY; SORPTION; REMOVAL; VAPOR; HEATS	The fixed-bed adsorption process has been studied as one of the promising processes for the recovery of tritiated water in the field of nuclear fusion. The influence of the framework SiO2/Al2O3 ratio ranging from 2.0 to 10.0 on the tritiated water adsorption and desorption characteristics in the H2O-HTO binary systems was systematically examined using NaX and NaY zeolites. A large difference in isotherm was observed by changing the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio from 7.0 to 10.0. The framework SiO2-to-Al2O3 ratio has a slight effect on the isotope separation factor. The capacity of removable water from NaY10.0 around room temperature is approximately four times larger than that from NaA2.0 even though both zeolites have nearly the same capacity for absorbable H2O at nearly P/Po = 1.0. The weaker interaction generates the isotope effect on desorption. The HTO dehydration ratio has a strong interrelation with the accumulative amount of purge gas. Dehydration is independent of the flow rate of the purge gas. On the design side of the water adsorption process with multi-absorber systems, the size of the water absorber such as a dryer or dehumidifier can be downscaled with NaY10.0 as the adsorbent since the consideration of the heating and cooling periods necessary for the temperature swing desorption process is not required in the NaY10.0 column.

Burnup calculations in assembly geometry were carried out with a neutronics code system, SRAC, and a Monte Carlo burnup calculation method, MVP-BURN, based on a nuclear data library, JENDL-3.3. The measured burnups were determined based on the Nd-148 method, where the fission yield of Nd-148, energy release per fission, and correction factors for neutron captures by Nd-147 and Nd-148 were analytically obtained by averaging with burnups. The C/Es of the sample burnups are 0.96 to 1.07 for both analysis methods. By modifying the power histories to adjust the calculated burnups to the measurements of the samples, burnup calculations were performed again and the isotope inventories were compared with the measurements. The C/Es of the inventories are 1.00 to 1.09 for U-235, 0.91 to 1.04 for Pu-239, 0.96 to 1.07 for Pu-240, and 0.90 to 1.02 for Pu-241 for the six samples excluding those of a corner fuel rod.
