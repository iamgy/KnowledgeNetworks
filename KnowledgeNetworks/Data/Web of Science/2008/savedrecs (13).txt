Effect of tritium and decay helium on the fracture toughness properties of stainless steel weldments	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				WELDS	J-Integral fracture toughness tests were conducted on tritium-exposed-and-aged Types 304L and 21-6-9 stainless steel weldments in order to measure the combined effects of tritium and its decay product, helium-3 on the fracture toughness properties. Initially, weldments have fracture toughness values about three times higher than base-metal values. Delta-ferrite phase in the weld microstructure improved toughness provided no tritium was present in the microstructure. After a tritium-exposure-and-aging treatment that resulted in similar to 1400 atomic parts per million (appm) dissolved tritium, both weldments and base metals had their fracture toughness values reduced to about the same level. The tritium effect was greater in weldments (67 % reduction vs. 37% reduction) largely because the ductile discontinuous delta-ferrite phase was embrittled by tritium and decay helium. For both base metals and weldments, fracture toughness values decreased with increasing decay helium content in the range tested (50800 appm).

Different types of interaction have been investigated : trapping on stress field and strain-induced defects, enhanced diffusion along dislocation networks, transport by moving dislocation. For several reasons, the quantification of these interactions is a major challenge in nuclear systems involving the presence of tritium : prevention of tritium-induced damage, tritium inventory, management of tritiated waste... This paper reports recent results on the quantitative characterization of tritium deformation interactions in fcc materials.

Tritium release and trapping in austenitic stainless steels: Role of microstructure and desorption anneal	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					The behavior of hydrogen and its isotopes in materials is a major concern in future nuclear systems both for the predictive analysis of the role of H, D, T in the environmental degradation of structural materials, for the confinement and inventory of tritium, and for the management of tritiated wastes. This study is focused on the characterization of the effect of the alloy microstructure, of desorption anneal and of oxide films on the tritium behavior (desorption kinetics, trapping, residual concentration) in various austenitic stainless steels. Different techniques (high temperature extraction of hydrogen, beta counting of tritium in massive samples) were used to study : the tritium absorption and desorption in several stainless steels, the role of the annealing conditions (temperature/time) on the tritium residual concentration and desorption flow, and the role of microstructural defects and of oxide films on the diffusion and trapping of tritium.

Effects of H(2)O and H(2)O(2) on thermal desorption of tritium from stainless steel	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; BEHAVIOR; RELEASE; SS316	Tritiated stainless steel was subjected to thermal desorption at various temperatures, different temperature profiles, and in the presence of different helium carrier gas additives. In all cases the identities of the desorbing tritiated species were characterized as either water soluble or insoluble. The samples were found to contain 1.1 mCi +/- 0.4 mCi. Approximately ninety-five percent of this activity was released in molecular water-soluble form. Additives of H(2)O or H(2)O(2) to dry helium carrier gas increase the desorption rate and lower the maximum temperature to which the sample must be heated, in order to remove the bulk of the tritium. The measurements validate a method of decontamination of tritiated steel and suggest a technique that can be used to further explore the mechanisms of desorption from tritiated metals.	[Quinlan, M.

From this viewpoint, the influence of oxygen on the surface reaction rates of hydrogen on V and To were examined in an ultra-high vacuum apparatuses at elevated temperatures, and the results were compared with the data on Nb acquired in a previous study. The surface reaction rates of hydrogen on V and Ta, and consequently permeation rates, decreased with increasing oxygen concentration in the bulk as previously observed for Nb. These observations were ascribed to the increase in surface oxygen coverage with increasing bulk oxygen concentration. The weakest influence of oxygen on hydrogen permeation rate was observed for V. The expected permeation rate through V under typical blanket conditions, however, was not necessarily high due to high oxygen solubility in V. The evaluation indicated that the highest permeation rate should be obtained with Nb under typical blanket conditions.

Observation of tritium distribution in iron oxide with tritium micro autoradiography	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				STEEL	To clarify the tritium permeation behavior, tritium distribution in iron oxidized in high temperature water was observed with tritium micro autoradiography. It was found that tritium was distributed homogeneously in the iron metal. However the oxide surface (magnetite) was found to contain a very low concentration of tritium. The inner layer of oxide could strongly effect the tritium permeation. From a comparison with the permeation experiment that had been reported in Ref. 1, it was suggested that tritium would mainly diffuse other path except the oxide lattice. According to the chemical form of tritium, which was released from iron surface into water, two assumptions were suggested. One is based on the different combination of tritium on the water-surface interface. The other is based on the oxidation mechanism.

In addition, the appreciable amount of hydrogen (tritium) is trapped on the surface and/or surface oxides of RAF/M, but they are hardly released and show no influence on the overall hydrogen release behavior. At very low hydrogen concentration, almost all hydrogen atoms are trapped at the deepest trapping site, probably M23C6, and the sites are easily saturated. With increasing the hydrogen concentration, the shallower trapping sites are occupied Remaining hydrogen atoms seem to be in normal (interstitial) sites, whose amount increases with the square root of the hydrogen loading pressure, but they are still influenced by trapping with lattice imperfections and/or grain boundaries.

Hydrogen retention in deposition layers formed from type 316 stainless steel	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				RF PLASMA	From the viewpoints of plasma control and radiation safety, tritium retention in deposition layers is an important problem. In this study, deposition layers from type 316 stainless steel were formed by a sputtering method using hydrogen RF plasma at three different temperatures. The behavior of hydrogen release from the deposition layers was observed by a thermal desorption method at argon atmosphere. It was found that hydrogen retention and release behavior greatly change depending on the temperature of a substrate where the layer is formed The surface structure of the layer also changed depending on the temperature. However, the ratios of metallic atoms such as Fe, Cr and Ni in deposition layers were almost the same as that in type 316 stainless steel.

Deuterium and helium release and microstructure of tungsten deposition layers formed by RF plasma sputtering	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				RETENTION	It is important to evaluate tritium behavior in tungsten deposition layers considering a long-term plasma operation. In this study, tungsten deposition layers were formed by deuterium or helium RF plasma sputtering. The release behavior of deuterium or helium from the layers were observed by a thermal desorption method When a tungsten deposition layer does not contain oxygen, the retained deuterium is mainly released as D-2. When oxygen exists in the layer, the majority of deuterium is released as water vapor. Tungsten deposition layers have an amorphous structure and consist of fine grain with size of 2-3 nm. Numerous bubbles are observed in the layers. A formation of tungsten deposition layer in a fusion reactor may make tritium control more difficult.

Tritium diffusion in V-4Cr-4Ti alloy	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				VANADIUM; HYDROGEN; IMPURITIES; SOLUBILITY; NITROGEN; BEHAVIOR; NIOBIUM; TA; NB	Characteristics of the tritium diffusion coefficient D-T in V-4Cr-4Ti alloy, including a bending in the Arrhenius plot of D-T, are examined. Based on a trap model, the possible trap sources and their binding energies for tritium in the alloy are evaluated using the experimental data of D-T in pure V which are measured with a tritium tracer method and the literature data of protium diffusion in V-Ti and V-Cr alloys. The result of the evaluation suggests the presence of two trap sources in the alloy. The first would be attributed to a trap at each substitutional alloying atom which is likely to be Ti. The binding energy E-B of 0.08 eV gives the best fit to the observed value of D-T above 300 K The bending in the Arrhenius plot below 300 K is caused by a second trap site with a higher E-B, and a lower concentration than those of each alloying atom. The trap is probably formed by the alloying atoms presence to neighboring Ti atoms. The contribution of Cr atom to the trap effect seems to be rather small in this alloy.

The effect of water on tritium release behavior from solid breeder candidates	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				CAPACITY; SURFACE	The authors have made a tritium release model to represent the release behavior of bred tritium from solid breeder materials using a series of studies. It has been observed that a large amount of adsorbed water and water produced by water formation reaction are released to the purge gas even though dry purge gas with hydrogen is introduced to solid breeder materials. According to our tritium release model, the presence of water in the purge gas and surface water on the material has a large effect on the tritium release behavior. In this study, the authors quantified the amount of adsorbed water and the capacity of the water formation reaction for various solid breeder materials (Li2TO3, Li4SiO4, Li2ZrO3, LiAlO2). The effect of surface water on the chemicalform of tritium released from the LiAlO2 blanket is also discussed in this study.

Reported data from several investigators have shown that the processes of oxidation, adsorption, absorption, and permeation are all coupled and interactive. A computer model has been developed for predicting the interaction of hydrogen isotopes and their corresponding oxides in a flowing carrier gas stream with the walls of a metallic tube, particularly at low hydrogen concentrations. An experiment has been constructed to validate the predictive model. Predictions from modeling lead to unexpected experiment results.

Measurement of the He-3 permeability of DT-filled fused silica inertial confinement fusion (ICF) targets to study the effects of He-3 on neutron emission during implosion	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				SOLUBILITY; GLASS	A set of laser implosion experiments were conducted at the OMEGA laser at the University of Rochester, Laboratory for Laser Energetics (LLE) to study the effect of He-3 concentration in DT-filled target shells on fusion yield in ICF implosions.. Eleven laser fusion shells consisting of 1100-mu m diameter, hollow, fused silica spheres with 4.6 to 4.7-mu m-thick walls were loaded with 520 kPa of deuterium-tritium (DT) and then with He-3 (101.3 or 520 kPa). The He-3 permeabilities of the shells were determined by measuring the pressure rate of rise into a system with known volume. A mathematical method was developed that relied on the experimental fill pressure and time, and the rate of rise data to solve differential equations using MathCAD to simultaneously calculate He-3 permeability and initial He-3 partial pressure inside the shell. Because of the high permeation rate for He-3 out of the shells compared to that for DT gas, shells had to be recharged with He-3 immediately before being laser imploded or "shot" at LLE. The He-3 partial pressure in each individual shell at shot time was calculated from the measured He-3 permeability. Two different partial pressures of He-3 inside the shell were shown to reduce neutron and gamma yields during implosion.

Tritium exposure effects on the samples were characterized by dynamic mechanical analysis (DAM) and radiolysis products were characterized by measuring the total final pressure and composition in the exposure containers at the end of exposure period. There was no effect of one week tritium exposure on the glass transition temperature, Tg, of the samples tested Impurity gases produced in the closed containers included HT and lesser amounts of H-2, DTO, and CT4. The total pressure remained the same during exposure.

Working with multiple isotopes and isotopomers is always accompanied by isotope exchanges, which are accelerated by catalysts. These are provided by surfaces of various materials, which are used in the recycling systems. Here new results are reported of the solubility of hydrogen in Fomblin oil and kinetics for reactions between D2O, HDO, H2O and D-2, HD and H-2 taking place at the surface of a stainless steel (SS304) vessel at pressures of about 350 Pa. The kinetics of hydrogen isotopes were measured by Raman spectrometer. The water isotopomers were monitored by mass spectrometry. The solubility of hydrogen in Fomblin oil was determined at several H-2 pressures using NAM spectroscopy. The results can be extended to lower pressures using Henry's law.

Interaction of tritium with oils and tritiated waste oil decontamination	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					Mineral and synthetic oils used as lubricants or operating fluids in pumps are mixtures of branched or cyclic saturated hydrocarbons. They are chemically inert but their slow partial oxidation is possible even at room temperature. Specific activity of pump oils contacted with gaseous tritium for a long time may exceed 10(13) Bq/kg. Studies of waste oils show that more than 90% of the radionuclide is bound with oxidation products. This selectivity is owned to predominant formation of quasi-free tritons or (HeT+)-He-3 ions when one of the two nuclei in the T-2 molecule decays. The sequence of ion-molecule triton transport reactions is the mechanism responsible for accumulation of tritium by oxidation products with higher proton affinity. The most effective technique of oil decontamination is adsorption of tritiated species by polar adsorbents (silica gels, zeolites). The detritiation degree for these adsorbents amounts to 95%. Then complete thermal oxidative destruction can be used to convert adsorbed organic compounds into CO2 and water. Thus, adsorption, thermal oxidation and adsorbent regeneration may be proposed as the technology of tritium recycling since HTO returns to the isotope separation system. As a result, the radiation danger related with storage of high activity waste oils can be significantly decreased.	[Sazonov, A. B.; Veretennikova, G. V.; Magomedbekov, E.

J	Jacobs, WD; Hang, T				Jacobs, William D.; Hang, Thong			Model of diffusers/permeators for hydrogen processing	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					Palladium-silver (Pd-Ag) diffusers are mainstays of hydrogen processing. Diffusers separate hydrogen from inert species such as nitrogen, argon or helium. The tubing becomes permeable to hydrogen when heated to more than 250 degrees C and a differential pressure is created across the membrane. The hydrogen diffuses better at higher temperatures. Experimental or experiential results have been the basis for determining or predicting a diffuser's performance. However, the process can be mathematically modeled, and comparison to experimental or other operating data can be utilized to improve the fit of the model. A reliable model-based diffuser system design is the goal which will have impacts on tritium and hydrogen processing. A computer model has been developed to solve the differential equations for diffusion given the operating boundary conditions. The model was compared to operating data for a low pressure diffuser system. The modeling approach and the results are presented in this paper.

Post service examination of a tritium permeator and a turbomolecular pump from the CAPER facility at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				ITER	After 8 years of operation at the CAPER' facility at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe, a permeator used to separate hydrogen species from processed gases ceased operation due to multiple heater failures. This was subjected to post service examination to find the cause of the failures. This paper describe the methods used to locate the failures in the heaters and the likely cause. It was also necessary to determine the tritium inventory embedded in the structure for safe disposal. Destructive examination, adapted from a full combustion technique, was used on sections of the permeator. A fine black powder deposit, presumed to be mostly carbon, coated the surfaces of the inlet section of the feed side. This powder contained nearly half of the tritium within the permeator. The likely source of the powder and the consequences for the operation and eventual decommissioning of the ITER Tritium Plant are discussed. A failed turbomolecular pump from CAPER was also examined. There was evidence of wear on the emergency support bearing, but more importantly, when the pump internals were exposed to the glove box atmosphere (dry air) large quantities of tritium were rapidly released, this despite the isotopic swamping before removal from the CAPER glove box. Significant uptake of tritium in electrical insulation was also found.	[Caldwell-Nichols, C.

A simple flow analysis of diffuser-getter-diffuser systems	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					Tritium clean-up systems typically deploy gas processing technologies between stages of palladium-silver (Pd/Ag) diffusers/permeators. The number of diffusers positioned before and after a gas clean-up process to obtain optimal system performance will vary with feed gas inert composition. A simple method to analyze optimal diffuser configuration is presented The method assumes equilibrium across the Pd/Ag tubes and system flows are limited by diffuser vacuum pump speeds preceding or following the clean-up process. A plot of system feed as a function of inert feed gas composition for various diffuser configuration allows selection of a diffuser configuration for maximum throughput based on feed gas composition.

Up to 1400 hours tests were done at 700 degrees C, 202.7 kPa (1520 torr) with a 0.03 sLPM feed of methane plus impurities, in a 20 vol% hydrogen, balance helium, stream. Carbon dioxide gettered by St 909 can be equated to an equivalent amount of methane gettered, but equating nitrogen to an equivalent amount of methane was nitrogen feed composition dependent. A decreased hydrogen feed increased methane getter rates while a 30 degrees C drop in one furnace zone increased methane emissions by over a factor of 30. The impact of gettered nitrogen can be somewhat minimized if nitrogen feed to the bed has been stopped and sufficient time given to recover the methane cracking rate.	[Klein, J. E.; Sessions, H.

However, the trade-off is some reduction of operational flexibility due to decreased storage capacity for process and waste gases. Savannah River National Laboratory researchers are developing an integrated process gas model for tritium processing using Aspen Custom Modeler(TM) (ACM) software. The modeling involves fully characterizing process flow streams (gas composition, quantity), frequency of batch transfers, and availability of equipment in the flow stream. The model provides a valuable engineering tool to identify flow bottlenecks, thereby enabling adjustments to be made to improve process operations.	[Poore, A.

During routine operations, the glovebox atmosphere is recirculated and hydrogenous impurities (i.e. CQ(4), Q(2)O, and NQ(3), where Q H, D, T) are decomposed (cracked) and removed by Zr-Mn-Fe without absorbing elemental hydrogen isotopes. If the tritium content of the glovebox atmosphere becomes unacceptably high, the getter system can rapidly strip the glovebox atmosphere of all hydrogen isotopes by absorption on the Zr2Fe, thus lessening the burden on the facility waste gas treatment system. The getter system was designed for high flowrate (> 100 l/min), which is achieved by using a honeycomb support for the getter pellets and 1.27-cm diameter tubing throughout the system for reduced pressure drop. The novel getter bed design also includes an integral pre-heater and copper liner to accommodate swelling of the getter pellets, which occurs during loading with oxygen and carbon impurities. Non-tritium functional tests were conducted to determine the gettering efficiencies at different getter bed temperatures and flow rates by recirculating gas through the system from a 6-m(3) glovebox containing known concentrations of impurities.

A variety of semiconductor materials are exposed to tritium (T) gas at pressures of up to 120 bar and temperatures of up to 250 T. Tritiated materials include hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), crystalline silicon (c-Si), silica and carbon nanotubes (CNT). Deep ultra-violet laser irradiation was used to lock tritium in silica films. Effusion measurements show the presence of stable tritium in silicon, silica and CNTs up to 400 degrees C. IR absorption spectra show a Si-T stretching mode at 1200 cm(-1) indicating the formation of stable Si-T bonds in a-Si:H. SIMS measurements show that the penetration depth of tritium in a-Si:H and c-Si is 150 and 10 nm, respectively; the concentration of tritium locked in a-Si:H and c-Si is 20 and 4 at%, respectively. In tritiated silica 248-nm UV laser irradiation locks the permeated tritium at stable chemical bonding sites in the silica lattice. Thermal effusion measurement shows that 0.5 wt.% tritium can be stably immobilized in CNTs. The application of tritiated silicon as a cold electron source is demonstrated.

Smoke and particle detector using tritiated semiconductor foil	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				AMORPHOUS-SILICON	A smoke and particle ionization detector using tritiated amorphous silicon film as the radiation source is demonstrated. The ion chamber design includes both bipolar and unipolar region; the unipolar region is defined as the volume space extending beyond the range of ionizing particles. Attachment of ions to particulate matter in the unipolar region considerably reduces the mobility of the carriers, thus forming a space charge cloud accompanied by a reduction in the electrical field strength, thereby enhancing the particulate detection responsivity. Tritium beta s have a maximum range of about 6 mm in air, which makes the detector compact. Owing to the potential of increased specific activity, it results' in a gamma-free detector with improved sensitivity. The results show that this gamma-free detector is several-fold to forty-fold more responsive than traditional ionization detectors using Am-241. In addition, this ion chamber can function as a dual detector having both photoelectric and ionization detector responsivities.

The loading system resides in a sealed glovebox with a nitrogen atmosphere that is continually purged through a Glovebox Clean-up System. The tritium used in each loading experiment is approximately 6000 Ci (22 TBq). The process entails transferring the tritium inventory from the uranium storage bed to the cryogenically cooled (77 K) molecular sieve chamber. The molecular sieve at liquid nitrogen temperature is capable of adsorbing tritium to densities of 290 Ci/gram at one atmosphere. At 523 K a maximum tritium pressure of 21 MPa is achieved. The loading apparatus is used to develop high-density radioactive isotope fuel for self-powered microelectronic and micromechanical devices. This paper presents the design specifics of the tritium exposure apparatus, the steps taken in generating the high-temperature, high-pressure tritium atmosphere and the performance characteristics of the apparatus. Additionally, the handling practices and equipment utilized to conduct the tests safely are presented.

J	Peterson, SR				Peterson, Sylvie-Ring			Dose to the public from tritium released to the atmosphere from the Livermore site of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 1953 through 2005	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						accident analysis; dose reconstruction; modeling; dose assessment; tritium	MODELS; AIR	Throughout 53 years of operations, an estimated 29,300 TBq of tritium were released to the atmosphere at the Livermore site of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL); about 75% of this was released as tritium gas primarily in two accidental releases. A tritium dose reconstruction was undertaken to chronicle both the annual doses to the public for each year of operations and the doses from seven accidental releases. Although LLNL has always reported releases and calculated doses in compliance with regulatory requirements, annual doses were not calculated prior to 1973, and the only dose reported from an accidental release was that in 1970. Annual doses (means and 95% confidence intervals) for 1953 through 2005 to the most exposed members of the public were calculated using the same equilibrium dose model and assumptions. From 1973 through 2005, predicted tritium concentrations in air were compared with observed mean annual concentrations at one location, and predicted doses were compared with those reported by LLNL. A mean dose with 95% confidence interval was also calculated for each accidental release using an equation derived from extensive experience with a dynamic process-oriented model. Predicted air concentrations were overestimated, on average, by a factor of 1.6, 70% of the doses reported by LLNL in annual compliance documents fell within the predicted confidence intervals, and all predicted doses from routine and accidental releases were well below regulatory limits. The highest annual mean dose to an adult was 34 mu Sv in 1957; the highest dose from an accidental release was 330 mu Sv in 1954.

Tritium recapture behavior at a nuclear power reactor due to airborne releases	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						tritium; radioactivity; airborne; monitoring; environmental; nuclear power plant	PRECIPITATION; PLANTS	This paper describes the initiatives taken by Cook Nuclear Plant to study the on-site behavior of recaptured tritium released in its airborne effluents. Recapture is the process where a released radioactive effluent, in this case tritium, is brought back on-site through some mechanism. Precipitation, shifts in wind direction, or anthropogenic structures that restrict or alter effluent movement can all lead to recapture. The investigation was started after tritium was detected in the north storm drain outfall. Recent inadvertent tritium releases by several other nuclear power plants, many of which entered the groundwater, have led to increased surveillance and scrutiny by regulatory authorities and the general public. To determine the source of tritium in the outfall, an on-site surface water, well water, rainwater and air-conditioning condensate monitoring program was begun. Washout coefficients were also determined to compare with results reported by other nuclear power plants. Program monitoring revealed detectable tritium concentrations in several precipitation sample locations downwind of the two monitored containment building release vents. Tritium was found in higher concentrations in air-conditioning condensate, with a mean value of 528 Bq L-1 (14,300 pCi L-1). The condensate, and to a lesser extent rainwater, were contributing to the tritium found in the north storm drain outfall. Maximum concentration values for each sample type were used to estimate the most conservative dose. A maximum dose of 1.1 X 10(-10) mSv (1.1 X 10(-8) mrem) total body was calculated to determine the health impact of the tritium detected.

An experimental analysis of the contribution of Ra-228 progeny to the gross alpha-particle activity of water samples	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						alpha particles; radioactivity; environmental; radium; water		The contribution of Ra-228 progeny to the gross alpha-particle activity of water samples by EPA Method 900.0 is investigated as a function of residue mass and geometry and time between sample collection and analysis. It is shown that these factors can cause the contribution of Ra-228 progeny to gross alpha-particle activity to be up to 2.2 times the initial Ra-228 activity for grab samples and up to 3.5 times the initial Ra-228 activity for quarterly composite samples when samples are held for the maximum 6-mo holding time. Thus, under some conditions, Ra-228, by itself, can cause a gross alphaparticle violation (>0.55 Bq L-1). Since Ra-228 activity is already regulated, a gross alpha-particle activity violation that only exists because of the presence of Ra-228 can be considered to be a false positive violation.

Proposed standards for acute exposure to low enrichment uranium for compliance with 10 CFR 70.61	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topics; dose assessment; emergencies, radiological; regulations	CHEMICAL TOXICITY; FOLLOW-UP	Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations Part 70, puts forth requirements for licensure of special nuclear material including specific risk criteria for acute intakes based on biological effects. Standards for acute oral and inhalation intakes of soluble low enrichment are proposed for the three levels of biological effects given in the regulations. These levels were developed largely from available human data and have a large measure of conservatism. The proposed threshold for life endangerment was 500 mg for acute inhalation intakes and 2,500 mg for acute ingestion intakes. Acute intakes of 1,400 mg for ingestion and 100 mg for inhalation are proposed as thresholds for irreversible or serious long lasting health effects. For minor transient health effects, the proposed levels are 410 and 30 mg, respectively, for acute ingestion and inhalation intakes. For acute intakes below these levels, no demonstrable toxicological effects are anticipated.

As soon as these devices are deployed in radioactive environments, designers need hardening solutions to mitigate radiation-induced errors. When low-cost applications have to be developed, the traditional hardware redundancy-based approaches exploiting m-way replication and voting are no longer viable as too expensive, and new mitigation techniques have to be developed. In this paper we present a new approach, based on processor duplication, checkpoint and rollback, to detect and correct soft errors affecting the memory elements of embedded processors. Preliminary fault injection results performed on a PowerPC-based system confirmed the efficiency of the approach.

In this study, carbon steel. previously corroded electrochemically under aerobic conditions, was left in contact with compacted Kunigel V1 and Kunipia F under reducing conditions for 3 to 4 years at room temperature. The corrosion products, which migrated from the carbon steel into compacted bentonite, were investigated by selective dissolution analysis, which can estimate the crystallinity of Fe-bearing compounds, and by spectro photometry to determine the valence of iron in the corrosion products. From these analyses, the corrosion products in compacted bentonite were identified to be amorphous, noncrystalline or poorly ordered Fe(OH)(2) and Fe(OH)(3). Furthermore, the alteration of smectite to Fe-smectite in compacted bentonite was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). In the XRD analysis, Fe-smectite was not identified in Kunipia F from the variation in basal spacing as a function of relative humidity.

The model is an extension of the unreacted shrinking core model with a shrinking spherical particle and takes into account particle expansion resulting from the density difference between UO2 and UO2F2. This model successfully represents the initial expansion of the particle by the formation of the low-density UO2F2 intermediate. The accuracy of this model is higher than that of the original model, which does not allow particle expansion.

Four highly burnt fuel rods of different burnups (from 52 GWd/t to 126 GWd/t) and a fresh rod have been investigated. This paper describes the tomographic station built to acquire the projections together with the related experimental procedure, followed by the description of the image reconstruction techniques implemented. The principal results obtained are presented and analysed at three levels. First, the derived linear attenuation coefficient matrix, which is very useful for the implementation of emission tomography, is discussed. Second, the variation of density as a function of rod radius is presented, showing an interesting morphological change of the fuel with burnup. Particularly for the highest burnup sample, the periphery is characterised by a lower density (a steep decrease of almost 10% from the adjacent region) characteristic of an ultrahigh-burnup high-porosity structure. Finally, the nondestructive derivation of the volume-averaged fuel density was performed, compared with other experimental data, and plotted as a function of burnup, so that an interesting linear relationship between density and burnup was established, providing a potential indicator for the noninvasive determination of nuclear fuel rod burnup.

Diverse active well neutron coincidence counter utility at the Savannah River National Laboratory	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								In this paper we describe use of the Aquila active well neutron coincidence counter for nuclear material assays of (235)U in multiple analytical techniques at Savannah River Site (SRS), at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL), and at Argonne West National Laboratory (AWNL). The uses include as a portable passive neutron counter for field measurements searching for evidence of (252)Cf deposits and storage; as a portable active neutron counter using an external activation source for field measurements searching for trace (235)U deposits and holdup; for verification measurements of U-Al reactor fuel elements; for verification measurements of uranium metal; and for verification measurements of process waste of impure uranium in a challenging cement matrix. The wide variety of uses described demonstrate utility of the technique for neutron coincidence verification measurements over the dynamic ranges of 100-5000 g for U metal, 200-1300 g for U-Al, and 8-35 g for process waste. In addition to demonstrating use of the instrument in both the passive and active modes, we also demonstrate its use in both the fast and thermal neutron modes.	[Dewberry, R. A.; Salaymeh, S.

Extraction of U(VI), Pu(IV), Am(III) and some fission products by 2-ethylhexyl phosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester immobilized polyvinyl alcohol hydrogels	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; PRECONCENTRATION; SEPARATION; ADSORPTION; RESIN; IONS; ACTINIDES; MEMBRANE; URANIUM; CARRIER	Cross-linked hydrogel matrices immobilized with 2-ethylhexyl phosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester (HA), were prepared to investigate their application in the recovery of radionuclide from acidic waste solutions. Gamma-radiation was used to produce HA immobilized polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels (HA-gel). The hydrogels with different characteristics such as: degree of cross-linking (by varying radiation dose) and quantity of extractant immobilized (by starting with aqueous PVA solution containing different amounts of HA), were synthesised. These HA-gels were investigated for solid-liquid phase extraction of U(VI), Pu(IV), Am(III) and some fission products, under various experimental conditions. The concentration of HNO(3) in the aqueous phase was found to play an important role in the extraction of these radionuclei. Extraction of U(VI) was more favourable at lower concentration of HNO(3) (similar to 0.001 to 0.5M), while at higher concentrations (similar to 0.5 to 3M HNO(3)), more than 90% of Pu(IV) present in the aqueous phase, could be extracted by the HA-gel. The extraction of Am(III) was also found predominant only at lower acidities (at pH similar to 2 and above). Under optimized conditions, maximum metal loading capacities obtained were 19 +/- 0.8 mg, 8 +/- 0.4 mg and 11 +/- 0.5 mg per gram of swollen HA-gel, for U(VI), Pu(IV) and Am(III), respectively. Under the experimental conditions, extractions of Cs(I) and Sr(II) were observed to be negligible. No leaching out of HA from the HA-gel particles was noted even after its repetitive use for the studied ten cycles of extraction and stripping experiments, as evident from its unchanged extraction efficiency.

Encouraging biosorption of (241)Am from aqueous solutions by free or immobilized Rhizopus arrhizus (R. arrhizus) has been observed in our experiments. In this study, the preliminary evaluation on the mechanism was further explored via chemical or biological modification of R. arrhizus using europium as a substitute for americium. The results indicated that in approximately 48 hours R. arrhizus was able for efficient adsorption of (241)Am. The pH value of solutions decreased gradually with the uptake of (241)Am by R. arrhizus, implying that H(+) was released from R. arrhizus via ion-exchange. The biosorption of (241)Am by the decomposed cell wall of R. arrhizus was as efficient as by the intact fungus. The adsorption ratio for (241)Am by deacylated R. arrhizus dropped, implying that carboxyl functional groups of R. arrhizus play an important role in the biosorption of (241)Am. Most of the investigated acidic ions have no significant influence on the adsorption of (241)Am, while saturated EDTA can strongly inhibit the biosorption of (241)Am by R. arrhizus. When the concentrations of coexistent Eu(3+), Nd(3+) were 300 times more than that of (241)Am, the adsorption ratios would decrease to about 86% from more than 99%. It could be noted by transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis that the adsorbed Eu is scattered almost in the whole fungus, while Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) indicated that Ca in R. arrhizus have been replaced by Eu via ion-exchange. The change of the absorption peak structure in the IR spectra implied that there was complexation between metals and microorganism. The results implied that the adsorption mechanism of (241)Am by R. arrhizus is very complicated involved ion-exchange, complexation process as well as nonspecific adsorption in the cell wall by static electricity.

Synthesis and characterization of radiation sensitive TiO(2)/monazite photocatalyst	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; OXIDE SURFACES; DEGRADATION; PHENOL; RADIOLYSIS; TIO2; HEXACHLOROBENZENE; DECOMPOSITION; NANOPARTICLES; FILMS	A TiO(2)/monazite photocatalyst was prepared by embedding TiO(2) nanoparticles into a monazite substrate surface. TiCl(4) hydrolysis/citric acid chelating procedure under acidic conditions were used to synthesize the nanophase TiO(2) particles. The anatase TiO(2)/monazite photocatalyst surface area, morphology, crystalline and elemental concentrations were characterized using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Monazite contains a large amount of Ce-, La-, Nd- and Th-PO(4) compounds; it has been known as a natural mineral material with minor radioactivity. TiO(2)-CeO(2) composite is a kind of radiation sensitive photocatalyst in which the radiations of thorium nuclides give energy to trigger TiO(2) and cerium ions which play an energy absorber with charge separator. The result showed that methylene blue and phenol were spontaneously photocatalytic decomposed by TiO(2)/monazite composite even in a dark environment. A synergistic effect was also examined with applied exterior UV or (60)Co irradiation. A hybrid mechanism is proposed; according by the radioluminescence (RL) from excited Ce ion by gamma-radiation soliciting CeO(2)/TiO(2) heterojunction (HJ). This seems to be a possible mechanism to explain this self-activated photo-catalytic behavior.	[Yu, C. T.] Inst Nucl Energy Res, Chem Anal Div, Longtan 325, Taiwan; [Wang, C. F.; Chen, T.

Sediment samples, and where available, aquatic plants were collected along these two rivers and their inflow and tributary rivers. (137)Cs, (238)U, (234)U, (239+240)Pu, (238)Pu, (90)Sr and (241)Am activity concentrations were measured. The radionuclide levels measured were relatively low, and in most cases below the detection limit, as compared with those from other areas of the world which have been directly affected by effluents from nuclear installations or influenced by the Chernobyl accident. The results indicated that the radionuclides are of natural origin or attributable to the atmospheric fallout from nuclear weapons tests or to the Chernobyl-derived deposition.

Complexation of uranium(VI) with aromatic acids such as hydroxamic and benzoic acid investigated by TRLFS	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; FLUORESCENCE SPECTROSCOPY; SALICYLHYDROXAMIC ACID; BENZOHYDROXAMIC ACID; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; METAL-COMPLEXES; SIDEROPHORE; TIME; EQUILIBRIUM; 1-PHOSPHATE	The complex formation of uranium(VI) with salicylhydroxamic, benzohydroxamic, and benzoic acid was investigated by time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS). We observed in all three systems a decrease in the fluorescence intensity with increasing ligand concentration. All identified complexed uranyl species are of the type M(p)L(q)H(r). In the uranium(VI)-salicylhydroxamate system a 1:1 complex with a stability constant of log beta(111) = 17.34 +/- 0.06 and a 1:2 complex with a stability constant of log beta(122) = 35.0 +/- 0.11 was identified. Also in the uranium(VI)-benzohydroxamate system the stability constants are determined to be log beta(110) = 7.92 +/- 0.11 and log beta(120) = 16.88 +/- 0.49. In the uranium(VI)-benzoate system only a 1:1 complex is existent with a stability constant of log beta(110) = 3.56 +/- 0.05.

Application of neutron well coincidence counting for plutonium determination in mixed oxide fuel fabrication plant	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ASSAY; MASS	Mixed oxide (MOX) fuel is an alternative to conventional enriched uranium oxide fuel in thermal reactors. Indian interest in plutonium recycle in thermal reactors is primarily due to the need to develop alternative indigenous fuel for two boiling water reactors (BWR) at Tarapur, which are designed to use imported light enriched uranium fuel. A few MOX assemblies have been fabricated and loaded into the reactors. Neutron well coincidence counting (NWCC) system has been successfully employed to check the enrichments of PuO(2) in MOX blends. NWCC has also been successfully applied in developing dry recycling process of clean rejected oxide (CRO) and dirty rejected oxide (DRO).	[Kumar, Pradeep; Ramakumar, K.

Radiochemical separation and quality assessment for the (68)Zn target based (64)Cu radioisotope production	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							NUCLEAR-REACTIONS; EXCITATION-FUNCTIONS; SMALL CYCLOTRON; CROSS-SECTION; GA-67; NICKEL; NI-64	The radiochemical separation of the different radionuclides ((64)Cu, (67)Cu, (67)Ga, (66)Ga, (56)Ni, (57)Ni, (55)Co, (56)Co, (57)Co, (65)Zn, (196)Au) induced in the Ni supported Cu substrate - (68)Zn target system, which was bombarded with the 29.0 MeV proton beam, was performed by ion-exchange chromatography using successive isocratic and/or concentration gradient elution techniques. The overlapped gamma-ray spectrum analysis method was developed to assess the (67)Ga and (67)Cu content in the (64)Cu product and even in the post- (67)Ga production (68)Zn target solution without the support of radiochemical separation. This method was used for the assessment of (64+67)Cu radioisotope separation from (67)Ga, the quality control of (64)Cu product and the determination of the (68)Zn (p,2p)(67)Cu reaction yield. The improvement in the targetry and the optimization of proton beam energy for the (68)Zn target based (64)Cu and (67)Ga production were proposed based on the stopping power and range of the incident proton and on the excitation functions, reaction yields and different radionuclides induced in the target system.
