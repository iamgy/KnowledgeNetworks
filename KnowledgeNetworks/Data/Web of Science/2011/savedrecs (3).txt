Muhammad			RELATIVE RADIOLOGICAL RISKS DERIVED FROM DIFFERENT TENORM WASTES IN MALAYSIA	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								In Malaysia technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials (TENORM) wastes are mainly the product of the oil and gas industry and mineral processing. Among these TENORM wastes are tin tailing, tin slag, gypsum and oil sludge. Mineral processing and oil and gas industries produce large volume of TENORM wastes that has become a radiological concern to the authorities. A study was carried out to assess the radiological risk related to workers working at these disposal sites and landfills as well as to the members of the public should these areas be developed for future land use. Radiological risk was assessed based on the magnitude of radiation hazard, effective dose rates and excess cancer risks. Effective dose rates and excess cancer risks were estimated using RESRAD 6.4 computer code. All data on the activity concentrations of NORM in wastes and sludges used in this study were obtained from the Atomic Energy Licensing Board, Malaysia, and they were collected over a period of between 5 and 10 y. Results obtained showed that there was a wide range in the total activity concentrations (TAC) of nuclides in the TENORM wastes. With the exception of tin slag and tin tailing-based TENORM wastes, all other TENORM wastes have TAC values comparable to that of Malaysia's soil. Occupational Effective Dose Rates estimated in all landfill areas were lower than the 20 mSv y(-1) permissible dose limit. The average Excess Cancer Risk Coefficient was estimated to be 2.77 x 10(-3) risk per mSv. The effective dose rates for residents living on gypsum and oil sludge-based TENORM wastes landfills were estimated to be lower than the permissible dose limit for members of the public, and was also comparable to that of the average Malaysia's ordinary soils. The average excess cancer risk coefficient was estimated to be 3.19 x 10(-3) risk per mSv. Results obtained suggest that gypsum and oil sludge-based TENORM wastes should be exempted from any radiological regulatory control and should be considered radiologically safe for future land use.

STRATEGY FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY AND SOCIALLY ATTRACTIVE FUSION TRITIUM SYSTEM	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 24-29, 2010	Nara, JAPAN				ENERGY	Some strategic considerations for fusion energy to be deployed in the future as environmentally and socially attractive option are presented from safety and resource aspects. With the environmental and biological behavior of tritium being understood, not only emission control by technological approach, controlling impacts on public health and social acceptability also became more important. Safety feature of the fusion plant that exhausts small amount of tritium in normal operation based on active control of emission leads to possible better scenario for reduced impacts. Selection of the coolant and possible emergency procedure will have impact on accidental scenario. Fuel resource issue is another major feature that affects attractiveness. Self sufficiency of tritium and deuterium in the total plant system was considered in relation with the operation scenario and development strategy.

MODELING THE BUILD-UP OF ORGANICALLY BOUND TRITIUM IN CROPS AFTER ACUTE TRITIUM EXPOSURE IN GREENHOUSE'S ENVIRONMENT	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 24-29, 2010	Nara, JAPAN				HT RELEASE EXPERIMENT; CHALK-RIVER; PLANTS; VAPOR; RICE; GROWTH; WATER; OBT	The processes of tritium uptake, losses, transformation and organically bound tritium (OBT) build-up in crops such as potatoes, tomatoes, lettuce and wheat were studied in a set of experiments on crop' short-term exposure to tritiated water (HTO) in a greenhouse. The crops were exposed at the stage of linear growth between blossoming and ripening. The results of experiments were used to develop a model of OBT build-up in crop's storage organs. The model allows estimate tritium uptake, losses in crop's leaves as well as its transformation in OBT and transport to storage organs of plants. The model parameters were obtained from the measured data for each crop's type by using regression analysis. The model was validated against experiments. The model can be used to assess OBT activity in storage organs of crops upon short-term exposure in the atmosphere contaminated by HTO .

REALISTIC AND PRACTICAL MODELING OF TRITIUM DEPOSITION TO BARE SOIL	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 24-29, 2010	Nara, JAPAN				HYDROGEN ISOTOPIC GASES; OXIDATION RATE; SURFACE	This paper develops a theory of tritium deposition, which is then combined with the experimental results, depicting the temperature and moisture dependence of the HT oxidation rate. The model describes the atmosphere-to-soil HT deposition process in terms of the atmospheric transport in the surface boundary layer, the transport in soil and the oxidation process by microbial activity. This model is favorably validated with the field data from the Canadian tritium release experiment. Based on this fundamental but sophisticated model, a practical model of HT deposition velocity is developed as a simple function of the soil temperature and the soil moisture. This model drastically reduces the uncertainty in the deposition velocity from a few orders of magnitude to a factor of 2.

In the IAEA's Environmental Modelling for Radiation Safety (EMRAS I) programme, there have been done progresses for routine releases and in the present, a dedicated working group (WG 7 - "Tritium" Accidents) of EMRAS II programme is focused on the potential accidental releases (liquid and atmospheric pathways). This working group tries to develop more robust models in international cooperation, analyzing the processes involved concerning tritium transfer in the environment. Briefings of the actual progresses in this working group, as well as other tritium studies, are presented. Romania, having CANDU reactors, is interested in both liquid and atmospheric accidental release consequences. Progresses done in the frame of EMRAS are presented, as well as tritium washout, transfer in aquatic media, and transfer to farm animals and birds. An extension of the metabolic model for tritium transfer applied to humans is briefly described.

Since the late 60's, the nuclear site of Valduc, has been discharging tritium gas and tritiated water to the atmosphere. Those discharges have lead to a transfer to the nearby groundwater and rivers. A balance of the tritium migrating through the hydrogeological system is presented for the 1969-2009 period. Surface survey data bring also quite a lot of information about transfers by the air pathway. This concerns the different compartments: air, rain, soil, vegetable and animals. Ratios between the different compartment concentration show that air-leaves transfer is important, that rain and air deposition are of the same order of magnitude, and that a relatively good equilibrium exist between free and organic material water of the vegetable. Some outdoor experiments confirm, in agreement with literature, the level of incorporation in organic materials. Outside the centre, water always remained below the present WHO limit of quality for drinkable water. Radiological impact has been assessed and is presently less than 1 mu Sv.y(-I) for individual of the nearby population. Tritium appears to be a very good indicator of the site specific characteristics.	[Guetat, Ph; Boyer, C.; Duda, J.

Atmospheric tritium concentrations of three chemical forms such as water HTO, hydrogen HT and methane CH(3)T had been measured since 2004. Tritium concentrations of HTO, HT and CH(3)T were distributed around 2-23 mBq/m(3), 6-11 mBq/m(3) and 0.5-3 mBq/m(3) respectively The HTO concentration principally depends on humidity in air. Recent decreasing rate of HT concentration to half was estimated 19.4 years. The OBT concentration tends to decrease and the rate to half was almost 9.4 years. Also the OBT measurements were cross checked with burning and liquid scintillation counting method and (3)He mass spectrometric method Both analyzed results showed good agreement. Long term monitoring of environmental tritium would be necessary from view point of safety on future nuclear fusion development.

In spite this, an updated compilation of litterature data show that 77% of OBT/TFWT ratios measured in terrestrial plants and food items are greater than one, with a mean value of 1.92. On the other hand, OBT/TFWT ratios for aquatic samples do not show such a tritium anomaly, with 81% of the published ratios being less than I. This strongly suggests that the cause for excess tritium in terrestrial organic matter has to be found in the atmosphere. We have developed a simple model of tritium incorporation during plant growth, forced by the annual cycle of tritium in precipitation taken from the IAEA/ISOHIS database. The simulated distribution of the OBT/TFWT ratios for terrestrial samples shows many similarities with the observed one. Although other processes such as soil moisture with lower tritium content than atmospheric water vapour can be invoked, our results suggest that the annual tritium maximum which occurs in spring, during the growing season, is capable of creating substantial OBT/TFWT enrichments and has to be considered as well.

The dried grass sample was used for the experiments. To eliminate the exchangeable OBT, the sample was washed with tritium free water before analysis. Three times washing reduced the tritium activity in the labile sites below the detectable level. In radiometry the sample was combusted to convert the OBT as well as other hydrogen isotopes to. water and tritium activity in the water was measured by liquid scintillation counting (LSC). In mass spectrometry, the sample was kept in a glass container and He-3 produced by tritium decay was measured by mass spectrometry. The results were in good agreement suggesting applicability of these methods for environmental tritium analysis. The mass spectrometry is more suitable for environmental tritium research because of a lower detection limit than that of the LSC.

Three environmental samples with background level OBT concentrations were analyzed, and the results agreed well with those by the conventional liquid scintillation counting of electrolyzed combustion water of the samples. This showed that the method is practical and effective. We also developed an analytical method for non-exchangeable OBT as a combination of pre-treatment of dried samples with free water (3)H and our newly developed analytical method for OBT. The repeated analysis of a grass sample with moderate (3)H concentration had smaller variance of results for non-exchangeable OBT than for OBT. The sum of non-exchangeable and exchangeable OBT agreed well with OBT measured in the samples. The developed method was successfully applied to terrestrial and marine environmental samples with background (3)H levels.

Concentrations of (3)H were measured in the samples collected during the period of the final testing using actual spent fuel in the plant. The stable isotope ratios of hydrogen and oxygen in water samples were also measured for a hydrological study around the plant area. Concentrations of (3)H in the river water samples were in the background level, and their variation among sampling locations was small. Although well water samples also did not have significantly high (3)H concentrations originating from the (3)H released from the plant, the variation in (3)H concentration among sampling locations was larger than that in the river water samples. Comparison of delta D and delta(18)O data with a local meteoric water line suggested that groundwater around the plant area is mainly recharged by precipitation in winter.

During testing, tritium-contaminated wastewater was intermittently released into the coastal sea and diluted by the surrounding seawater. We measured tritium concentrations in seawater along the Pacific coast in the Aomori area to understand its temporal and geographical variation. Coastal seawater samples were collected two or three times a year at four sites along the coast from 2006 to 2009. Samples were enriched by electrolysis up to a volume reduction factor of fifteen. Both tritium and deuterium concentrations were measured to calculate the samples' tritium concentrations. Tritium concentrations obtained in this way were usually below 0.5 Bq/L, but they sometimes exceeded 1.0 Bq/L at the four sites on separate dates. From this result we estimate that the tritium-contaminated water is diluted by the coastal water current or by the stagnating water in the release area while it is discharged.

TRITIUM EMISSIONS FROM A DETRITIATION FACILITY	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 24-29, 2010	Nara, JAPAN				REMOVAL FACILITY	Tritium is produced in heavy-water reactors through neutron capture by the deuterium atom. Annual production of tritium in a CANDU reactor is typically 52-74 TBq/MW(e). Some CANDU reactor operators have implemented detritiation technology to reduce both tritium emissions and dose to workers and the public from reactor operations. However, tritium removal facilities also have the potential to emit both elemental tritium and tritiated water vapor during operation. Authorized releases to the environment, in Canada, are governed by Derived Release Limits (DRLs). DRLs represent an estimate of a release that could result in a dose of 1 mSv to an exposed member of the public. For the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station, the DRLs for airborne elemental tritium and tritiated water emissions are similar to 15.6 PBq/week and similar to 825 TBq/week respectively. The actual tritium emissions from Darlington Tritium Removal Facility (DTRF) are below 0.1% of the DRL for elemental tritium and below 0.2% of the DRL for tritiated water vapor. As part of an ongoing effort to further reduce tritium emissions from the DTRF, we have undertaken a review and assessment of the systems design, operating performance, and tritium control methods in effect at the DTRF on tritium emissions. This paper discusses the results of this study.

SITE SPECIFIC ATMOSPHERIC DISPERSION SIMULATION SYSTEM-TRITIUM RELEASE	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 24-29, 2010	Nara, JAPAN					The Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant, located in northeastern Aomori prefecture, is currently undergoing the final commissioning test using actual spent nuclear fuels (the Active Test). Tritium had been discharged from the reprocessing plant and some effects to the environment were observed since the Active Test had been started at the reprocessing plant on March 31, 2006. The purpose of this study is to predict the environmental impact of the reprocessing plant once it becomes operational. An atmospheric dispersion simulation system, developed by the authors, has been utilized to predict the expected tritium dispersion during the plant future operations. In this study, a simulation of tritium dispersion was carried out using wind velocities and wind directions as prediction factors for future HTO activity. The simulation results were compared with actual HTO activity measurements taken during the autumn of 2006 and the spring and autumn of 2007. The results of the simulation appear to accurately reflect the actual measured results from HTO measurements in the autumn seasons of both 2006 and 2007, however, there were discrepancies between the data set from the spring of 2007 and predicted results formulated by the simulation for that same period.

THEORETICAL STUDY OF THE REACTIVITY OF MIXED MANGANESE AND SILVER OXIDES ON HYDROGEN SIMULATING TRITIUM FOR THE LIMITATION OF OUTGASSING FROM WASTE DRUMS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 24-29, 2010	Nara, JAPAN					The oxide mixture MnO(2)/Ag(2)O has been identified as one of the best materials to oxidize hydrogen under ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure conditions. Studies have been carried out within the scope of the mitigation of hydrogen risk in fusion reactors(1-4) and the optimal composition of this mixture has been determined by Chaudron as MnO(2)/Ag(2)O 10% wt. Using Maruejouls' experiments(3-4), a model, previously developed to explain the oxidation of hydrogen by copper oxide for helium purification purpose(5), has been adapted and its simulation capability tested. To achieve this point, an exploratory experiment with a thin MnO(2)/Ag(2)O bed has been carried out under low hydrogen initial concentration (130 Vppm) in order to simulate tritium degassing. Although a very good global agreement between the calculations and the experimental points, the model is unable to account for the behaviour of hydrogen breakthrough at the beginning of the experimentation. Thus, enhancements of this model are presented in this paper. Finally, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM analyses confirm the coherence of some assumptions used to solve the model equations.

Similarly, Aomori Pref and Tohoku Electric Power Co., Inc. have been carrying out monitoring around the Higashidori Nuclear Power Station. Results which exceeded the background levels of environmental tritium were observed in water vapor, some seawater samples and some fish samples (measured as tissue free-water tritium(TFWT)) since the final commissioning test using actual spent nuclear fuels (Active Test) was started at the RRP on March 31 2006. Therefore, we examined causes for these results by considering the operational status of the RRP and meteorological and hydrographic conditions. The committed effective dose estimated by using the results for the effect of the RRP was far below the annual dose limit for the public (1 mSv).

CONSEQUENCES OF DIFFERENT METEOROLOGICAL SCENARIOS IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESMENT OF TRITIUM RELEASE	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 24-29, 2010	Nara, JAPAN			Tritium; dose impact; dispersion model; lagrangian models		The environmental impact of systems managing large (kg) tritium amount represents a public scrutiny issue for the next coming fusion facilities as ITER and DEMO. Furthermore, potentially new dose limits imposed by international regulations (ICRP) shall impact next coming devices designs and the overall costs of fusion technology deployment. Refined environmental tritium dose impact assessment schemes are then overwhelming. Detailed assessments can be procured from the knowledge of the real boundary conditions of the primary tritium discharge phase into atmosphere (low levels) and into soils. Lagrangian dispersion models using real-time meteorological and topographic data provide a strong refinement. Advance simulation tools are being developed in this sense. The tool integrates a numerical model output records from European Centre for Medium range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) with a lagrangian atmospheric dispersion model (FLEXPART). The composite model ECMWF/FLEXTRA results can be coupled with tritium dose secondary phase pathway assessment tools. Nominal tritium discharge operational reference and selected incidental ITER-like plant systems tritium form source terms have been assumed. The real-time daily data and mesh-refined records together with lagrangian dispersion model approach provide accurate results for doses to population by inhalation or ingestion in the secondary phase.

MODELLING AND VALIDATION OF OBT FORMATION IN TOMATO AND POTATO PLANTS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 24-29, 2010	Nara, JAPAN					This study is devoted to the collection and robust analysis of 2008-2009 field data pertaining to airborne tritium transfer in potato and tomato plants subject to continuous releases. The study is a part of implementation and validation of tritium transfer model ported to Canadian LAnd Surface Scheme (CLASS), which has been recently extended towards plant phenomenology in Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (CTEM+CLASS v.2.7). The initial validation has been performed for ratios of organic to free-water tritium in plant tissues (OBT/HTO ratios) retrieved from the simple off-line tritium uptake and re-emission routine assessed against historical OBT/HTO ratio datasets. The observed underestimate of high OBT/HTO ratios in this simple model warrants deployment of CTEM+CLASS and makes it necessary to focus the next experimental validation effort at tritium re-emission phase. The concentration of HTO in the upper soil layer, in the different parts of vegetation and in the air has been assessed. The sampling was performed on weekly and hourly scales, in the latter case with emphasis on a night-time period. The process of uptake from atmosphere has been clarified using plants grown on the clean tarp-covered soil at Acid Rain Site of Chalk River Laboratories (CRL), which dumped the root uptake pathway. The processes of root uptake and re-emission from plant were clarified at the irrigated Perch Lake site of CRL. Auxiliary environmental drivers and site-specific data were collected according to format of inputs and parameterization of CTEM+CLASS.	[Korolevych, V. Y.; Kim, S.

A polyethylene bottle with a porous polyethylene membrane at the opening was used as the sampler. The bottle contained 300 g of molecular sieve 3A (MS-3A) for adsorbing water vapor passing through the membrane. The concentration of (3)H in water recovered from the MS-3A in the bottle was compared with that obtained by an active type sampler. Both (3)H concentrations agreed well with each other, which showed that the method developed was practical and effective. Using the passive type samplers at nine sampling points around the nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in November and December 2007, we successfully obtained the monthly areal distributions of (3)H concentrations in the atmospheric water vapor.

To validate the hydrodynamic model using actual field data, the concentration of tritium (3 H) was measured in water samples collected in and around the lake from 2005 to 2008. The samples collected from 2006 to 2008 occasionally showed higher concentrations than background when high concentration seawater flowed into the lake with the tide. H-3 concentrations in the lake water estimated by the model were generally within 10% of the observations, although the observed values were overpredicted by a factor of 2 in a few cases.

In order to appraise the influence of tritium released from nuclear facilities to the environment, it is necessary to confirm the effect of tritium appearing overlapped on background tritium levels. Tritium concentrations and stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in rain water, stream water and groundwater at the NIFS (National Institute for Fusion Science, Gifu prefecture, Japan) site were analyzed to understand behavior of the natural tritium in coupling with rain event. Conductivity, temperature and flow rate of the stream were monitored continuously. The range of tritium concentrations in rain for three year period was 0.09-0.78 Bq/l (average 0.37 +/- 0.14 Bq/l). The tritium concentrations of stream water and groundwater were almost constant, 0.34 Bq/l and 0.25 Bq/l, respectively. The isotopic ratio of oxygen and hydrogen showed a typical seasonal pattern observed in Japan. Two component separation analysis was carried out for the stream water at the time of rain using isotopic ratio, conductivity and tritium concentration.

Although tritium is considered to be little accumulated in bottom sediments and soils, it has been found that depending on the geochemical properties of soils tritium can be accumulated in some rocks due to binding with organic substances of the soil or penetrating into the layers of clay minerals and retaining in the interlayer space. Depending on the way of tritium inflow (water way or bottom sediments) it is distributed in plant parts non-uniformly. Here, in all the cases lamina dominates as the part of the plants most actively participating in photosynthesis. At constant tritium inflow to the Canada water weed biomass the intervention level for tritium was 2900 Bq/l.

CAPER MODIFICATIONS AND FIRST EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ON HIGHLY TRITIATED WATER PROCESSING WITH PERMCAT AT THE TRITIUM LABORATORY KARLSRUHE	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 24-29, 2010	Nara, JAPAN				PALLADIUM-MEMBRANE-REACTOR; ITER FUEL-CYCLE; MECHANICAL DESIGN; TECHNICAL PERMCAT; VALIDATION; EXPERIENCE; RECOVERY; SYSTEM; TESTS	The CAPER facility operated at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe for the demonstration of the tokamak exhaust processing system comprises a PERMCAT reactor as final clean-up stage. CAPER has been upgraded to enable the production of highly tritiated water (HTW) to be detritiated with PERMCAT. A staged approach for HTW production in CAPER is ongoing, using currently a metal oxide reactor, and later a microchannel catalytic reactor. The whole experimental plan using the current single-tube PERMCAT reactor shall cover the HTW processing at flow rates up to 10 mL/min, with HTW up to 1.4 MCi/kg (i.e. stoichiometric DTO). The staged approach and corresponding CAPER modifications are described. The first experimental results obtained using metal oxide reactor are reported and discussed.

Kogel catalysts and Dixon gauze rings were mixed at a certain ratio and packed in the column in a random manner. Performance tests of tritium separation by the column of 1 m length and 2.5 cm I.D. were performed at 101 kPa and 343 K. The maximum value of the separation factor was 19200 when the flow rate of hydrogen gas was 5 L/min. The optimum value of catalyst packing ratio was obtained as 35 % by the analysis using the channeling stage model. The values of separation factors predicted by the model corresponded with measured ones very well.

A LIGHT-WATER DETRITIATION PROJECT AT CHALK RIVER LABORATORIES	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 24-29, 2010	Nara, JAPAN					The NRU reactor rod bays is a large, open pool of water that receives hundreds of fuel rods annually, each carrying a small amount of residual tritiated heavy water. The tritium concentration of the rod bays water has risen over the years, to a level that is of concern to the operations staff and to the environment. The proposed long-term solution is to reduce the rod bays tritium concentration by direct detritiation of the water. The Combined Electrolytic-Catalytic Exchange (CECE) process is well suited to the light-water detritiation problem. With a tritium-protium separation factor greater than five, a CECE detritiation process can easily achieve the eight orders of magnitude separation required to split a tritiated light-water feed into an essentially tritium-free effluent stream and a tritiated heavy water product suitable for recycling through a heavy water upgrader. This paper describes a CECE light-water detritiation process specifically designed to reduce the tritium concentration in the NRU rod bays to an acceptable level. The conceptual design of a 600 Mg/a detritiation process has been developed and is now at the stage of project review and the beginning of detailed design.	[Boniface, H. A.; Castillo, I.; Everatt, A.

Two types of experiments were carried out ; one was the HTO exposure to the epoxy paint, and the other was the detritiation curves from the epoxy paint after the HTO exposure. Stainless steel vessel chambers with the epoxy painted inside surfaces were first exposed to an air flow containing HTO vapor (740 Bq/cm(3)) for 1 week, 2weeks and 2 months. After these exposures, detritiation of these chambers with an air flow was carried out. It was found that the interaction between the surface of the epoxy paint and the HTO such as adsorption and desorption is reached the steady state under these conditions. Based on experimental detritiation curves, the transport properties were evaluated using the tritium transport analysis code, TMAP. The trapping effect is the strong bonds between the HTO and the epoxy such as the chemical bonds, which is represented by trapped HTO in this analysis. Although diffusivity and solubility of HTO in epoxy paints almost agreed with the previous investigations, trapping like effect should be considered to explain observed detritiation behavior.

OXIDATION OF HYDROGEN OVER HONEYCOMB CATALYSTS UNDER THE PRESENCE OF WATER VAPOR	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 24-29, 2010	Nara, JAPAN					Recovery of tritium released into working areas in nuclear fusion plants is a key issue for safety. A large volume of air in the last confinement of fusion power plants should be processed by air cleanup system (ACS). In ACS, tritium gas is oxidized by catalysts, and then tritiated water vapor is collected by adsorbents. This method can remove tritium effectively, whereas high throughput of air causes higher pressure loss in catalyst and adsorbent beds. The pressure loss can be reduced by replacing the packed bed of catalysts with the honeycomb catalysts. In this study, the oxidation experiments of hydrogen in humid gases over honeycomb-type catalysts were performed, and the influence of water vapor on the rate of catalytic oxidation was investigated. The result of the experiments suggests that the rate of catalytic oxidation decreases with increasing water vapor content and its influence varies depends on the temperature. It is also indicated the rate of oxidation substantially decreases at the lower temperatures even in the case where water vapor contents is considerably lower. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the decrease in the catalytic activity by coexistent water vapor.

A SMALL CLOSED-CYCLE COMBINED ELECTROLYSIS AND CATALYTIC EXCHANGE TEST SYSTEM FOR WATER DETRITIATION	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 24-29, 2010	Nara, JAPAN					AECL has been actively involved in exploring advanced electrolysis technologies for its Combined Electrolysis and Catalytic Exchange (CECE) technology for water detritiation. A small-scale CECE system (mini-CECE) has been built and operated at AECL to explore its operation as a closed-cycle system with a proton-exchange membrane (PEM) type electrolysis cell. A similar mini-CECE system suitable for service with tritium concentrations up to 1000 Ci/kg(water) has been assembled, in collaboration with Tyne Engineering, for installation in a glovebox in AECL's Tritium Facility. These systems were developed as test-beds for membranes that had been selected for their expected tritium resistance. The systems allowed the measurement of membrane performance over long periods at very high tritium concentrations, as well as the ability to monitor any effects of membrane degradation products on the performance of exchange and recombiner catalysts. Preliminary work has been done with Nafion-112 membrane samples by exposing them to gamma and beta radiation to determine their suitability for use in tritiated CECE system. Doses of up to 1250 kGy of gamma or 200 kGy of beta were applied. Visual observations showed that gamma irradiation at doses below 400 kGy produced severe damage to the membrane. No significant physical damage was observed for samples exposed to 200 kGy from tritiated water. However this level of exposure to either gamma or beta radiation was sufficient to significantly decrease membrane performance in fuel cell tests.

We have previously reported the experimental results of successive isotope separation and enrichment in a H-2-D-2 mixture by the PSA process using a single column packed with SZ-5A. In this work, a PSA experiment using SZ-13X was carried out in a similar way to the previous experiment for comparing the functional adsorbents. The result shows that the PSA process operation with SZ-13X can make the performance of heavier isotope enrichment with efficiency at a factor of near twice in comparison to the same operation with SZ-5A.

The catalysts are used for Liquid Phase Catalytic Exchange (LPCE) and for gas-phase and trickle-bed recombination of hydrogen isotopes and have led to process simplification, improved safety and operational advantages. Catalyst performance design equations derived from laboratory testing of these catalysts have been validated against performance under industrial conditions. In a Combined Electrolysis and Catalytic Exchange (CECE) demonstration plant analyses of LPCE and recombiner efficiency were carried out as a function of catalyst activity over a wide range of operation. A steady-state process simulation used to model and design the hydrogen-water isotopic exchange processes, such as the CECE detritiation plant, was validated using the results of this demonstration. Catalyst development for isotope-exchange and recombination applications has continued over the last decade. As a result, significant improvements in catalyst performance have been achieved for these applications. This paper outlines the uniqueness of AECL's specialized catalysts and process designs for these applications with examples from laboratory and industrial case studies.

A commercially available membrane dehumidifier was evaluated experimentally for this purpose with the results indicating such a membrane is feasible for practical application. A small scale test apparatus having a capacity 1/10(th) (30 m(3)/h) that of the actual tritium recovery system with the same flow control system was constructed and its performance evaluated.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS FOR THE ISOTOPIC EXCHANGE OF A 1600 LITER TITANIUM HYDRIDE STORAGE VESSEL	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 24-29, 2010	Nara, JAPAN				TRITIUM; HYDROGEN	Titanium is used as a low pressure tritium storage material. The absorption/desorption rates and temperature rise during air passivation have been reported previously for a 4400 gram prototype titanium hydride storage vessel (HSV). A desorption limit of roughly 0.25 Q/M was obtained when heating to 700 degrees C which represents a significant residual tritium process vessel inventory. To prepare an HSV for disposal, batch-wise isotopic exchange has been proposed to reduce the tritium content to acceptable levels. A prototype HSV was loaded with deuterium and exchanged with protium to determine the effectiveness of a batch-wise isotopic exchange process. A total of seven exchange cycles were performed. Gas samples were taken nominally at the beginning, middle, and end of each desorption cycle. Sample analyses showed the isotopic exchange process does not follow the standard dilution model commonly reported. Samples taken at the start of the desorption process were lower in deuterium (the gas to be removed) than those taken later in the desorption cycle. The results are explained in terms of incomplete mixing of the exchange gas in the low pressure hydride.

In the present study, a flow-type plasma reactor utilizing capacitively coupled plasma followed by the double tube permeator of Pd-Ag was developed and tritium extraction from tritiated methane in helium was demonstrated. When the helium gas containing tritiated methane was passed through plasma, it was observed that the concentration of tritiated methane decreased and the concentration of HT increased. However, the apparent decomposition rate of tritiated methane was considerably smaller than that of methane. Moreover, the amount of extracted tritium by Pd-Ag was smaller than expected.

In the absence of sufficient experimental data on the reaction kinetics an appropriate theoretical model is proposed. Unknown parameters of the model have been estimated with use of Moller-Plesset ab initio method. The results of calculations are in a reasonable agreement with certain experiments performed earlier by other authors. The dependencies of equilibration rate on temperature, pressure, and tritium molar fraction are established for isotope mixtures containing no impurities.	[Sazonov, A. B.; Magomedbekov, E.

Although the isotope ratio between proton and tritium in the anode compartment was extremely low, tritium gas (HT) could be extracted along with hydrogen gas (H(2)) to the cathode compartment by the electrochemical hydrogen pump. The T/H isotope ratio in the cathode compartment was lower than that in the anode compartment because of the isotope effect in the hydrogen pump. However, when the hydrogen recovery rate increased, the ratio of hydrogen isotopes approached unity, which might be caused by variation in the T/H ratio along the axial direction. With respect to the tritium memory effect in the proton conductor, the isotope exchange reaction using wet gas was found to be an efficient method for tritium decontamination.

Valcea) was established in 1970 as a research focused Industrial Pilot Plant with the main goal of developing a heavy water production technology. Within ICIT there is an experimental pilot plant for tritium and deuterium separation, which has as main purpose the development of tritium separation technique from heavy water used as moderator in CANDU-like nuclear reactors as those existent at CNE Cernavoda. The CNE Cernavoda detritiation installation (CTRF) was designed primarily to reduce the level of tritium from the reactor moderator 1 of the nuclear power plant, from 54 Ci/kg- an estimated value to be achieved in 15 years of continuous operation, up to a threshold of maximum 0.54 Ci/kg. Under a contractual agreement ICIT Rm.Valcea and AECL are to jointly produce both a pre-feasibility and feasibility study for the project. The pre-feasibility study completed in August 2006, provided the rationale for choosing the Liquid Phase Catalytic Exchange-Cryogenic Distillation process for the Cernavoda TRF. After reaching the planned threshold in the water of moderator 1, the CTRF can alternatively provide the reduction in heavy water activity from the moderator of reactor 1 and 2 respectively.

All samples show higher D(2) adsorption than that of H(2), in which HY zeolite has the greatest isotopic effect while 13X zeolite has the highest hydrogen uptake capacity. Material's moisture content has significant impact to its hydrogen uptake. A material without adequate drying could result in complete loss of its adsorption capacity. Even though some materials present higher H(2) adsorption capacity at full pressure, their adsorption at low vapor pressure may not be as good as others. Adsorption capacity in a dynamic system is much less than in a static system, as expected. The same type of material from different vendors or lots may behave differently.	[Xiao, X.; Heung, L.

The permeation of tritium was lowered at similar to 1000ppm oxygen in Ar as a recovery gas. But tritium is easily converted to water firm by adding 10ppm oxygen. To explain these experimental results and expand the tritium behavior at double pipe concept, DFT and Monte Carlo simulations were applied. The surface oxide layer mode was developed and stability of tritium was evaluated. It was found that most stable structure was formed in the oxide layer although tritium is unstable at the surface of oxide layer. Tritium permeation rate was almost the same even if the oxide layer was formed, but the tritium retention is enhanced by adding the oxide layer. To expand these results to tritium permeation and recovery model, numerical analysis was performed as a function of sweep rate, material thickness and thickness of surface oxide layer. It was found that control of sweep rate is one of key factors. But the design restriction, control of oxide layer thickness by flowing O-2+Ar gas will be potential option for the recovery of tritium at steam generator.

ESTIMATION OF DTRF OPERATIONAL TRITIUM INVENTORY USING CRYOGENIC DISTILLATION COLUMN TEMPERATURE	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 24-29, 2010	Nara, JAPAN					For safe and efficient operation of the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station's Tritium Removal Facility (DTRF), it is necessary to track the amount of operational tritium inventory within the DTRF's process systems. Previous methodology that tracks operational tritium inventory is based on performing a tritium mass balance and does not provide an instantaneous way to determine inventory in the DTRF. The estimate of operational tritium inventory using this method is susceptible to increasing cumulative error of approximately +/- 2.6% per day as the DTRF continues to operate. Current methodology attempts to compensate for this cumulative error by assuming a constant value for operational tritium inventory whenever Mass 5 is detected by mass spectroscopy of tritium drawoff gas. However, this assumption is flawed and introduces significant error to the estimation of operational tritium inventory. A new method based on temperature of the cryogenic high tritium distillation (HTD) process is proposed which can track operational tritium inventory in a more instantaneous fashion and provides a result with a constant error of +/- 14% that does not increase over time.

HCLL AND HCPB COOLANT PURIFICATION SYSTEM: PRELIMINARY MEASUREMENT AND INSTRUMENTATION PLAN	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 24-29, 2010	Nara, JAPAN				TRITIUM; FUSION	The Coolant Purification System (CPS) together with the Tritium Extraction System (TES) and Helium Cooling System (HCS) are the principal auxiliary circuits of HCLL and HCPB TBMs to be tested in ITER. Among them, CPS is used to extract tritium from the cooling primary circuit as well as to guarantee the removal of gas impurities which could interact with structural material. Based on considerations in terms of safety, tritium accountancy and process control, instrumentation philosophy requires real-time tritium monitoring (which might be not very accurate) to control the processes in both TBM helium loops and special tritium accountancy procedure with regard to the interface with other sub-systems of the Tritium Plant. Furthermore, in addition to chemical speciation of the flow the control of the process requires the measurement of other parameters such as flow rates, pressures and temperatures. For each monitored parameter this paper describes the most suitable technologies, including a review of advantages, drawbacks and possible ways of improvement.

DETRITIATION SYSTEM OF AIR WITH HONEYCOMB CATALYST AND ADSORBENT	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 24-29, 2010	Nara, JAPAN				ADSORPTION; HYDROGEN; MS5A	Large amounts of tritium would be handled in D-T fusion power plants. Tritium is the radioisotope of protium, and is easily taken into the human body. With regard to nuclear fusion reactor facilities, the concept of multi-confinement system is applied to prevent tritium leaking to the environment. The last barrier to confine tritium is a building itself containing all equipment and facilities. If a severe accident takes place, tritium gas could leak into the facilities. In order to prevent tritium leaking to the environment, a secure air cleanup system (ACS) needs to be installed in the building. In ACS, the tritium gas, which leaks to rooms by an accident, is oxidized by catalysts, and then tritiated water vapor is collected by adsorbents. This method can remove tritium effectively, whereas which has a problem related to large ventilation force required to overcome high pressure drop in catalyst and adsorbent beds. Ventilation force could be substantially reduced by applying honeycomb catalysts and adsorbents to ACS. We investigated applicability of honeycomb catalysts and adsorbents to ACS, performing a screening test for the performance of honeycomb catalysts and adsorbents.

The results showed that the deuterium concentration was significantly increased by irradiation at 573 K due to production of hydrogen traps while it was not under irradiation below 400 K. In the latter case, however, the concentration was increased when the sample was heated around 550 K. The trap was considered to be a kind of interstitial defects and grown at 550 - 600 K from irradiation defects. Once produced, the trap was stable at least 710 K.
