RADIATION DOSES TO MEMBERS OF THE US POPULATION FROM UBIQUITOUS RADIONUCLIDES IN THE BODY: PART 1, AUTOPSY AND IN VIVO DATA	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						dosimetry; internal; radiation; background; thorium; uranium	NEW-YORK-CITY; SOFT-TISSUES; HUMAN-BONE; UNITED-STATES; WHOLE-BODY; RADIUM-226; LEAD-210; POTASSIUM; RESIDENTS; EXPOSURE	This paper is Part 1 of a three-part series investigating steady-state effective dose rates to residents of the United States from intakes of ubiquitous radionuclides, including radionuclides occurring naturally, radionuclides whose concentrations are technologically enhanced, and anthropogenic radionuclides. This series of papers explicitly excludes intakes from inhaling Rn-222, Rn-220, and their short-lived decay products; it also excludes intakes of radionuclides in occupational and medical settings. In this work, it is assumed that instantaneous dose rates in target organs are proportional to steady-state radionuclide concentrations in source regions. The goal of Part 1 of this work was to review, summarize, and characterize all published and some unpublished data for U. S. residents on ubiquitous radionuclide concentrations in tissues and organs. Forty-five papers and reports were obtained and their data reviewed, and three data sets were obtained via private communication. The 45 radionuclides of interest are the U-238 series (14 nuclides), the actinium series (headed by U-235; 11 nuclides), and the Th-232 series (11 nuclides); primordial radionuclides Rb-87 and K-40; cosmogenic and fallout radionuclides C-14 and H-3; and purely anthropogenic radionuclides Cs-137-(137)mBa, I-129, and Sr-90-Y-90. Measurements judged to be relevant were available for only 15 of these radionuclides: U-238, U-235, U-234, Th-232, Th-230, Th-228, Ra-228, Ra-226, Pb-210, Po-210, Cs-137, Rb-87, K-40, C-14, and H-3. Recent and relevant measurements were not available for I-129 and Sr-90-Y-90. A total of 11,741 radionuclide concentration measurements were found in one or more tissues or organs from 14 states. Data on age, gender, geographic locations, height, and weight of subjects were available only sporadically. Too often authors did not provide meaningful values of uncertainty of measurements, so that variability in data sets is confounded with measurement uncertainty. The following papers detail how these shortcomings are overcome to achieve the goals of the three-part series.

RADIATION DOSES TO MEMBERS OF THE US POPULATION FROM UBIQUITOUS RADIONUCLIDES IN THE BODY: PART 2, METHODS AND DOSE CALCULATIONS	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						dosimetry, internal; radiation, background; thorium; uranium	UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS; DISTRIBUTIONS; MODELS; ERRORS; LIMITS; POWER	This paper is Part 2 of a three-part series investigating effective dose rates to residents of the United States from intakes of ubiquitous radionuclides, including radionuclides occurring naturally, radionuclides whose concentrations are technologically enhanced, and anthropogenic radionuclides. This series of papers explicitly excludes intakes from inhaling Rn-222, Rn-220, and their short-lived decay products; it also excludes intakes of radionuclides in occupational and medical settings. In this work, it is assumed that instantaneous dose rates in target organs are proportional to steady-state radionuclide concentrations in source regions. Part 1 reviewed, summarized, characterized, and grouped all published and some unpublished data for U.S. residents on ubiquitous radionuclide concentrations in tissues and organs. Assumptions about equilibrium with long-lived parents are made for the 28 other radionuclides in these series lacking data. This paper describes the methods developed to group the collected data into source regions described in the Radiation Dose Assessment Resource (RADAR) dosimetric methodology. Methods for converting the various units of data published over 50 y into a standard form are developed and described. Often, meaningful values of uncertainty of measurements were not published, so that variability in data sets is confounded with measurement uncertainty. A description of the methods developed to estimate variability is included in this paper. The data described in Part 1 are grouped by gender and age to match the RADAR dosimetric phantoms. Within these phantoms, concentration values are grouped into source tissue regions by radionuclide, and they are imputed for source regions lacking tissue data. Radionuclide concentrations are then imputed for the source regions of other phantoms with missing concentration values, and the uncertainties of the imputed values are increased. The concentrations of hollow organs' contents are calculated, and activities are apportioned to the bone source regions using assumptions about each radionuclide's bone-seeking behavior. The data sets are then ready to be used to estimate equivalent dose rates to target tissues from these source regions. The target tissues are then mapped to lists of tissues with International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP) tissue weighting factors, or they are mapped to surrogate tissue regions when there is no direct match. Effective dose rates, using ICRP tissue weighting factors recommended in 1977, 1990, and 2007, can be calculated from the tissue and organ equivalent dose rates. These effective dose rates are reported in Part 3 of this series.

RADIATION DOSES TO MEMBERS OF THE US POPULATION FROM UBIQUITOUS RADIONUCLIDES IN THE BODY: PART 3, RESULTS, VARIABILITY, AND UNCERTAINTY	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						dosimetry, internal; radiation, background; thorium; uranium		This paper is Part 3 of a three-part series investigating effective dose rates to residents of the United States from intakes of ubiquitous radionuclides, including radionuclides occurring naturally, radionuclides whose concentrations are technologically enhanced, and anthropogenic radionuclides. The radionuclides of interest are the U-238 series (14 nuclides), the actinium series (headed by U-235; 11 nuclides), and the Th-232 series (11 nuclides); primordial radionuclides Rb-87 and (40) K; cosmogenic and fallout radionuclides C-14 and H-3; and purely anthropogenic radionuclides Cs-137-(137)mBa, I-129 and Sr-90-Y-90. This series of papers explicitly excludes intakes from inhaling Rn-222, Rn-220, and their short-lived decay products; it also excludes intakes of radionuclides in occupational and medical settings. In this work, it is assumed that instantaneous dose rates in target organs are proportional to steady-state radionuclide concentrations in source regions. Part 1 reviewed, summarized, characterized, and grouped all published and some unpublished data for U. S. residents on ubiquitous radionuclide concentrations in tissues and organs. Part 2 described the methods used to organize the data collected in Part 1 and segregate it into the ages and genders defined by the study, including imputed missing values from the existing data, apportioned activity in bone, and imputed activity in hollow organ contents and the remainder of the body. This paper estimates equivalent dose rates to target tissues from source regions and maps target tissues to lists of tissues with International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP) tissue-weighting factors or to surrogate tissue regions when there is no direct match. Effective dose rates using ICRP tissue-weighting factors recommended in 1977, 1990, and 2007, are then calculated, and an upper bound of variability of the effective dose rate is estimated by calculating the average coefficients of variation (CV), assuming all variance is due to variability. Most of the data were for adult males, whose average effective dose rate is estimated to be 337 mu Sv y(-1) (CV = 0.65, geometric mean = 283 mu Sv y(-1), geometric standard deviation s(G) = 1.81) using 2007 ICRP tissue-weighting factors. This result is between the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements' 1987 estimate of 390 mu Sv y(-1) (using 1977 w(T)s) and its 2009 estimate of 285 mu Sv y(-1) (using 2007 w(T)s) and is higher than the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation's 2000 estimate of 310 mu Sv y(-1) (using 1990 w(T)s). The methods and software developed for this project are sufficiently detailed and sufficiently general to be usable with autopsy data from any or all countries.

A NEW INTEGRAL-MODE SURVEY METHOD FOR THE DETERMINATION OF AVERAGE SURFACE CONTAMINATION LEVELS	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						activity-weighted size distributions; instrumentation; radioactivity, residual; scanning		A new integral-mode survey method is described for the direct measurement of average surface contamination levels. It is a method made possible by the modern generation of integrating ratemeters. Experiments were conducted to show both the effects of sources at a distance from or off-center from a probe. Case trials were conducted that demonstrated the method. It allows essentially four surveys to be performed for the price of one.

The filling gas was 1.5-3 torr of hydrogen (60%) deuterium (40%) mixture. The target was solid nuclear grade graphite with 5 mm thick, 9 cm width and 13 in length. The activations of the exogenous target on average of 20 shots (only one-third acceptable) through 10-13 kV produced the 511 keV gamma rays. Another peak found at the 570 keV gamma of which both was measured by a NaI portable gamma spectrometer calibrated by a Cs-137 0.25 mu Ci sealed reference source with its single line at 661.65 keV and Na-22 0.1 mu Ci at 511 keV. To measure the gamma rays, the graphite target converts to three different phases; solid graphite, powder graphite, and powder graphite in water solution. The later phase approximately has a doubled activity with respect to the solid graphite target up to 0.5 mu Ci of 511 keV and 1.1 mu Ci of 570 keV gamma lines were produced. This increment in activity was perhaps due to structural transformation of graphite powder to nano-particles characteristic in liquid water.	[Kiai, S. M.

Calibration of the ISOLDE acceleration voltage using a high-precision voltage divider and applying collinear fast beam laser spectroscopy	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						High-voltage divider; Collinear spectroscopy; ISOLDE facility; Isotope shift; Magnesium	ONLINE MASS SEPARATOR; CHARGE RADII; NUCLEAR-PHYSICS; ISOTOPES; MOMENTS; IONIZATION; FACILITY; LASPEC	A high-voltage divider with accuracy at the ppm level and collinear laser spectroscopy were used to calibrate the high-voltage installation at the radioactive ion beam facility ISOLDE at CERN. The accurate knowledge of this voltage is particularly important for collinear laser spectroscopy measurements. Beam velocity measurements using frequency-comb based collinear laser spectroscopy agree with the new calibration. Applying this, one obtains consistent results for isotope shifts of stable magnesium isotopes measured using collinear spectroscopy and laser spectroscopy on laser-cooled ions in a trap. The long-term stability and the transient behavior during recovery from a voltage dropout were investigated for the different power supplies currently applied at ISOLDE. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Pyroelectric fusion using a tritiated target	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Pyroelectric; Crystal; Tritium; Fusion; Accelerator; SEM; Field ionization	CRYSTAL; VACUUM	We demonstrate a compact 14.1 MeV neutron source by which deuterons are accelerated into a tritiated target via the action of a pyroelectric crystal. At the ion currents we measured, the expected flux is about 3 X 10(5) neutrons per second. Although our measured flux was much less than expected, spectral analysis of the neutron signal unambiguously verified a 14.1 MeV neutron signal far above background. The experimental fusion rate is limited by surface flashover and the time development of a surface barrier on the target due to chemical contamination. Various improvements in the, management of flashover originating from triple points and stabilization of field ionization tips are discussed. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Optimization of a simple X-ray diffraction instrument for portable and planetary applications	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						X-ray diffraction; Planetary instrumentation; Monte Carlo modeling; Ray-tracing; Geometry optimization; Parafocusing		The constraints placed on the design of portable and planetary X-ray diffraction (XRD) instruments by the limited mass, power and volume budgets are very different, in general, to the constraints applicable to laboratory equipment. A relatively simple angle-dispersive, reflection-mode instrument design with no moving parts is used to illustrate some optimization methods using Monte Carlo ray-trace modeling and theoretical calculations. Utilization of parafocusing is an important aspect of the optimization. An (55)Fe radioisotope X-ray source is assumed, and it is shown that commercial, off-the-shelf sources are not optimal in their design for XRD applications. The geometrical parameters relating to the source and to a simple collimating aperture are subjected to an optimization process, which keeps both the flux incident on the sample and the size of the parafocusing circle constant.

J	Scheffler, B				Scheffler, Beate			NUKEM: Innovative solutions for nuclear engineering	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								Management of radioactive waste, handling spent fuel elements, decommissioning of nuclear facilities, and engineering and consulting activities are services associated with the name of NUKEM all over the world. The company's scientists and engineers develop solution concepts combining the latest technologies with proven techniques and many years of experience. The company's history and the services offered to the nuclear industry began more than 5 decades ago. The predecessor, NUKEM Nuklear-Chemie-Metallurgie, was founded in 1960 as one of the earliest nuclear companies in Germany. Originally, the firm produced fuel elements for a variety of reactor lines. As early as in the 1970s, logical extensions of these business activities were nuclear engineering and plant construction. In the meantime, NUKEM Technologies GmbH has developed a worldwide reputation for its activities. Numerous reference projects bear witness to optimum project management and customer satisfaction. Since 2009, NUKEM Technologies has been a wholly owned subsidiary of the Russian Atomstroyexport. NUKEM Technologies operates sales and project offices outside Germany, e.g. in Russia, China, Lithuania, France, and Bulgaria. In this way, the company is present in its target markets of Russia, Western and Eastern Europe as well as Asia, offering customers and partners fast and direct contacts.

J							Urenco Deutschland GmbH	URENCO: Uranium enrichment with advanced technology	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								URENCO Deutschland is a subsidiary of URENCO Enrichment Company Limited, an international enterprise founded in 1970 in the State Treaty of Almelo, which offers uranium enrichment for nuclear power plants all over the world with the use of advanced technology. URENCO facilities at present are operated in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, USA, and in Germany. The German URENCO location is Gronau, Westphalia, where cascades have been in operation since 1985 using centrifuge technology to enrich nuclear fuel to up to 5 % uranium-235. The URENCO Group supplies nuclear power plants in Europe and overseas countries with a world market share, at present, of more than 25 % with a rising tendency. The first uranium separation plant in Gronau (UTA-1) attained its full separation performance of 1,800 t USW/a in late 2005. In February 2005, construction and operation of another plant had been licensed, which can raise the aggregate capacity on site to 4,500 t USW per annum. Construction of the new plant (UTA-2) was begun in summer 2005. UTA-2 will use the latest, most powerful URENCO centrifuge. URENCO has more than 3,500 visitors a year at its German location alone, thus demonstrating its proactive information policy and offering to the public a maximum of opportunities to acquire information by attending presentations and tours of the plant.

The separator, called SOLEROO, separates the large background of primary-beam particles from the radioactive species of interest. A further rejection of remnant unwanted nuclear species leaving the solenoid is achieved by tracking each emerging particle and identifying them event-by-event using a pair of position sensitive parallel plate avalanche counters. With primary Li-7 beam current of 1 e mu A , a He-6 production rate of 1.2 x 10(5) s(-1) has been achieved. The tagged secondary beam will be combined with a high efficiency 512 pixel silicon detector array for nuclear experiments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Rafiei, R.; Hinde, D.

The UNH crystal recovered from the MOX fuel dissolver solution containing simulated fission products (FPs) was purified by a sweating and melt filtration process. Although the decontamination factors (DFs) of Pu, Cs, and Ba did not change in the sweating process, that of Eu increased with increases in temperature and time. These results indicate that liquid impurities such as Eu were effectively removed by the sweating method, but solid impurities such as Pu, Cs, and Ba were minimally affected in the batch experiments. On the other hand, the DF of Ba increased with 0.45 and 5.0 mu m filters in the melt filtration process. Since Pu and Cs formed as Cs2Pu(NO3)(6) in the course of U crystallization and was accompanied with the UNH crystal, these behaviors were similar to each other. Although the DFs of Pu and Cs did not change with the 5.0 mu m filter, it increased approximately twofold with the 0.45 mu m filter. The particle size of Cs2Pu(NO3)(6) is relatively small and might pass through the 5.0 mu m filter in the melt filtration process. The liquid impurities as Eu remained in the molten UNH crystal with some filters.

The models are generally based on the assumption that K-d is independent of the element concentration in soil solution. However, at high soil solution concentrations, this assumption is not valid. Since the sorption of most radionuclides in soil is influenced by their stable isotope concentrations, it is necessary to consider if the range in the naturally occurring stable isotope concentrations in the soil solution is within the range over which K-d is valid. The objective of this study was to determine if the K-d for nickel (Ni) can be assumed to be constant over the ranges of stable Ni concentration in five main Japanese agricultural soil types. To obtain Ni sorption isotherms for five Japanese soils, two types of batch sorption tests were carried out using radioactive Ni-63 as a tracer. The concentration at which the relationship between soil and soil solution concentration became nonlinear was determined using the two types of sorption isotherms: the Langmuir and Henry isotherms. The result showed that the Ni concentration in the soil solution at which the assumption of a constant K-d becomes valid is at least ten times higher than the natural Ni concentrations in solutions of Japanese agricultural soils. This value is sufficient to treat K-d for Ni as constant for environmental impact assessment models for the disposal of radioactive waste.

In Part 1, we successfully simulated the unsteady behavior of a plume over a flat terrain. In this study, we propose a new scheme to generate a spatially developing turbulent boundary layer flow in the driver region based on the scheme in Part 1, and we perform LES of the turbulent flow and plume dispersion around a cubical building. Concerning the characteristics of flow and dispersion around a building, the main characteristics of turbulence structures and the distribution patterns of mean and r.m.s. concentrations agree well with those of wind tunnel experiments.

The initial Pu fissile content of the samples was 5.52 wt%, and the burnups ranged from 50 to 80 GWd/t. It is confirmed that a geometrical model including the effect of UO2 assemblies adjacent to the MOX assembly is necessary in the burnup calculations to obtain accurate calculated isotopic compositions. The calculated results of MVP-BURN with JENDL-3.3 taking such effect into account show more accurate results for major actinides (U, Pu, and Am isotopes) and most fission products than those of infinite assembly calculations. The paper also shows the results calculated using SRAC with JENDL-3.3, ENDF/B-VII, and JEFF-3.1.

J	Li, M; Aggarwal, ML				Li, Ming; Aggarwal, Manohar Lal			Stress analysis of non-uniform thickness piping system with general piping analysis software	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	19th International Conference on Structural Mechanics in Reactor Technology (SMiRT)	AUG, 2007	Toronto, CANADA					Most general piping analysis software can only perform ASME design stage type code compliance analysis with uniform pipe wall thickness. However, non-uniform wall thickness, commonly on elbows or bends, can be found in many industrial applications. A typical example is thinned non-uniform thickness at bends or elbows caused by flow accelerated corrosion (FAC). In this paper, an analysis procedure is introduced to enable a general piping software to conduct ASME III class 1 piping analysis with non-uniform wall thickness. The demonstration is performed on CANDU (Canadian Deuterium Uranium) feeder pipes, which have been subjected to FAC caused wall thinning. The results are compared with both conventional uniform thickness piping analysis and non-uniform thickness solid finite element analysis. The comparison shows the validity of the proposed "average-minimum-average" approach by employing the general piping analysis software. The approach remains conservative compared to the benchmark solid finite element analysis results. Meanwhile it provides lower acceptable thickness than the conventional piping analysis.

J	Rao, AR				Rao, A. Rama			Experimental and analytical dynamic analysis of coolant channel and its internals of Indian 540 MWe PHWR reactor	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	19th International Conference on Structural Mechanics in Reactor Technology (SMiRT)	AUG, 2007	Toronto, CANADA					The horizontal coolant channel is one of the important parts of primary heat transport system in PHWR type of reactors. There are in all 392 channels in the core of Indian 540 MWe reactor. Each channel houses 13 natural uranium fuel bundles and shielding and sealing plugs one each on either side of the channel. The heavy water coolant flows through the coolant channel and carry the nuclear heat to outside the core for steam generation and power production in the turbo-generator. India has commissioned one 540 MWe PHWR reactor in September 2005 and another similar unit will be in operation very shortly. For a complete dynamic study of the channel and its internals under the influence of high coolant flow, experimental and analytical study has been carried out. The operating life of a typical coolant channel typically range from 10 to 15 full power years. Towards the end of its operating life, its health monitoring becomes an important activity. Vibration diagnosis plays an important role as a tool for life management of coolant. A good correlation has been achieved between the results of experimental and analytical models. Through the study dynamic characteristics of the coolant channel under simulated loading condition, an attempt has been made to develop a diagnostics to monitor the health of the coolant channel over its operating life. Experimental study has been also carried out to characterize PHWR fuel vibration under different flow conditions. Such results are published for the first time. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A map of failure limits for Zircaloy-clad uranium dioxide fuel is developed using physically based analytical models. This failure map is used to assess the experimental data from the power pulse tests. It is shown that the fuel failure map provides a good basis for establishing criteria that demarcate the observed fuel failure modes for the various fuel designs that have been used in these tests.

High temperature deformation characteristics of Zirlo (TM) tubing via ring-creep and burst tests	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	19th International Conference on Structural Mechanics in Reactor Technology (SMiRT)	AUG, 2007	Toronto, CANADA				ALLOYS	Fuel cladding tubing acting as a barrier between coolant and radioactive fuel pellets in light water reactors undergo a combination of mechanical and thermal effects along with corrosive conditions during normal operations as well as accident situations, such as LOCA, etc. Therefore, the mechanical integrity of the cladding tubing is of critical importance. In this study, high temperature deformation characteristics of niobium-containing zirconium alloy cladding materials (Zirlo (TM)) have been evaluated via both ring-creep and burst tests. Creep-rupture data are presented in terms of Larson-Miller parameters (LMP). Data (creep rate vs. stress) from ring-creep and burst tests are analyzed, and operating deformation mechanisms are elucidated. This study demonstrates that the hoop creep data obtained from ring-creep and burst tests are equivalent, and one can be replaced with the other, if needed, in order to evaluate creep life.

This dry storage facility has seven separated modules. There are 40 long slender cylinders in one module. In one cylinder, ten baskets where sixty CANDU spent fuel bundles are loaded are stacked and stored. For this dry storage facility, analyses and tests for hypothetical accident conditions that might occur while moving and storing the baskets into a cylinder were performed. In a demonstration test, one of test basket models did not satisfy one of the safety-related requirements. Thus, the revised basket designs were generated using a structural evaluation based on finite element analyses and specimen tests. Among these revised designs, one design was chosen as a final revised basket design. The final revised design was the one creating the largest reduction of plastic strain in the upper welding region. It was also the one that required the smallest design change from the current basket design for easy adoption. Drop and leak tests were performed, and the final revised basket satisfied all performance requirements. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A new type of device designed and patented by the CEA was then tested in 2007 under inactive conditions and with uranium. The patent is for organic confinement in a pulsed column (PC). Actually, pulsed columns have been working for a long time in a nuclear environment, as they allow high capacity, sub-critical design (annular geometry) and easy high activity maintenance. The precipitation reaction between the oxalate complexing agent and a surrogate nitrate - cerium( Ill) or neodymium(III) alone, or coprecipitated uranium(IV) and cerium(III) - occurs within an emulsion created in the device by these two phases flowing with a counter-current chemically inert organic phase (for example tetrapropylene hydrogen-TPH) produced by the stirring action of the column pulsator. The precipitate is confined and thus does not form deposits on the vessel walls (which are also water-repellent): it flows downward by gravity and exits the column continuously into a settling tank. The results obtained for precipitation of cerium or neodymium alone in a short column of small diameter have demonstrated that high throughputs are feasible without system malfunctions. The measured particle size of the precipitates ranges from 20 to 40 mu m on average, and the measured device outflow indicates that the precipitation reaction is complete. These results suggest that this laboratory design can be extrapolated to an industrial column. Moreover, a recent test campaign demonstrated that a uranium-cerium coprecipitate easily forms when the two nitrates are mixed in a pulsed column of the same size operating under very similar process conditions. Qualitatively, the coprecipitate meets the process requirements to filter, calcine and fabricate the new nuclear fuel in the downstream steps. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kostadinov, V				Kostadinov, Venceslav			Developing new methodology for nuclear power plants vulnerability assessment	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								The fundamental aim of an efficient regulatory emergency preparedness and response system is to provide sustained emergency readiness and to prevent emergency situations and accidents. But when an event occurs, the regulatory mission is to mitigate consequences and to protect people and the environment against nuclear and radiological damage. The regulatory emergency response system, which would be activated in the case of a nuclear and/or radiological emergency and release of radioactivity to the environment, is an important element of a comprehensive national regulatory system of nuclear and radiation safety. In the past, national emergency systems explicitly did not include vulnerability assessments of the critical nuclear infrastructure as an important part of a comprehensive preparedness framework. But after the huge terrorist attack on 11/09/2001, decision-makers became aware that critical nuclear infrastructure could also be an attractive target to terrorism, with the purpose of using the physical and radioactive properties of the nuclear material to cause mass casualties, property damage, and detrimental economic and/or environmental impacts. The necessity to evaluate critical nuclear infrastructure vulnerability to threats like human errors, terrorist attacks and natural disasters, as well as preparation of emergency response plans with estimation of optimized costs, are of vital importance for assurance of safe nuclear facilities operation and national security. In this paper presented new methodology and solution methods for vulnerability assessment can help the overall national energy sector to identify and understand the terrorist threats to and vulnerabilities of its critical infrastructure. Moreover, adopted methodology could help national regulators and agencies to develop and implement a vulnerability awareness and education programs for their critical assets to enhance the security and a safe operation of the entire energy infrastructure. New methods can also assist nuclear power plants to develop, validate, and disseminate assessment and surveys of new efficient countermeasures. Consequently, concise description of developed new quantitative method and adapted new methodology for nuclear regulatory vulnerability assessment of nuclear power plants are presented.

J	Mundigl, S				Mundigl, Stefan			REVISION OF THE EURATOM BASIC SAFETY STANDARDS DIRECTIVE-CURRENT STATUS	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	European conference on individual monitoring of ionising radiation (IM)	MAR 08-12, 2010	Athens, GREECE					The European Commission is currently developing a revised Euratom Basic Safety Standards (BSS) Directive covering two major objectives: the consolidation of existing Euratom Radiation Protection legislation and the revision of the Euratom BSS. The consolidation will merge the following five Directives into one single Directive: the BSS Directive, the Medical Exposures Directive, the Public Information Directive, the Outside Workers Directive and the Directive on the Control of high-activity sealed radioactive sources and orphan sources. The revision of the Euratom BSS will take account of the latest recommendations by the International Commission on Radiological Protection and shall improve clarity of the requirements where appropriate. It is planned to introduce more binding requirements on natural radiation sources, on criteria for exemption and clearance, and on the cooperation between Member States for emergency planning and response. The provisions for regulatory control of planned exposure situations foresee a graded approach commensurate to the magnitude and likelihood of exposures from a practice. Finally, the new BSS shall take account of recent scientific developments. One additional goal is to achieve greater harmonisation between the Euratom BSS and the international BSS. While the requirements on the protection of workers, apprentices and students remain nearly unchanged, the revised BSS will clarify the roles and responsibilities of services and experts involved in technical and practical aspects of radiation protection, such as the occupational health services, the dosimetry services, the radiation protection expert and the medical physics expert. The requirements in the BSS on individual monitoring of category A workers remain unchanged, but the existing guidance on individual monitoring was revised and updated-the technical recommendations for monitoring individuals occupationally exposed to external radiation are published by the European Commission. This paper summarises the current status of the revision of the Euratom BSS Directive.

The fixed and portable whole-body counters, some hand-held monitors and portal monitors were all used to measure the 'radioactive' persons. This study validated the current emergency calibrations that are being used, and has shown areas for improvement for equipment deployment that had not been previously anticipated.

THE EXTRACTION OF THORIUM BY CALIX[6]ARENE COLUMNS FOR URINE ANALYSIS	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	European conference on individual monitoring of ionising radiation (IM)	MAR 08-12, 2010	Athens, GREECE				SOLVENT-EXTRACTION; U(VI)	Thorium is a natural alpha-emitting element occurring in various ores and has numerous industrial applications. Routine monitoring of potentially exposed workers is generally achieved through radiobioassay (urine and faeces). The procedures currently used for analysing actinides such as thorium in urine require lengthy chemical separation associated with long counting times by alpha-spectrometry due to low activity levels. Thus, their main drawback is that they are time-consuming, which limits the frequency and flexibility of individual monitoring. In this context, this study developed new radiochemical procedures based on the use of tertbutylcalix[6]arenes bearing three carboxylic acid groups or three hydroxamic acid groups. These previous works demonstrated that these macrocyclic molecules immobilised on an inert solid support are excellent extractants for uranium, plutonium and americium. In this study, the authors investigated the thorium extraction by calix[6]arene columns. Experiments were performed on synthetic solutions and on real urine samples. The influence of various parameters, such as the thorium solution pH and the column flow rate on thorium extraction, was studied. The results showed that both calix[6]arenes are efficient to extract thorium. Thorium extraction is quantitative from pH=2 for synthetic solution and from pH=3 for real urine samples. This study has demonstrated that the column flow rate is a crucial parameter since its value must not be too high to achieve the steady-state complexation equilibrium. Finally, these results will be compared with those obtained for other actinides (U, Pu and Am) and the conditions of actinides' separation will be discussed.

PARTICLE CLEARANCE IN THE ALVEOLAR-INTERSTITIAL REGION OF THE HUMAN LUNGS: MODEL VALIDATION	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	European conference on individual monitoring of ionising radiation (IM)	MAR 08-12, 2010	Athens, GREECE				FOLLOW-UP; INHALATION; RETENTION; PLUTONIUM	New information on particle retention of inhaled insoluble material indicates that the ICRP Human Respiratory Tract Model (HRTM) significantly underestimates long-term retention in the lungs. In a previous paper, the information from three studies was reviewed, and a model developed to predict particle retention in the lungs of coal miners was adapted in order to obtain parameter values for general use to predict particle retention in the alveolar-interstitial (AI) region. The model is physiologically based and simpler than the HRTM, requiring two instead of three compartments to model the AI region. The main difference from the HRTM AI model is that a significant fraction, about 35 %, of the AI deposit of insoluble material remains sequestered in the interstitium. The new model is here applied to the analysis of two well-known contamination cases with several years of follow-up data.	[Gregoratto, D.; Bailey, M. R.; Marsh, J.

ESTIMATION OF URANIUM GI ABSORPTION FRACTIONS FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	European conference on individual monitoring of ionising radiation (IM)	MAR 08-12, 2010	Athens, GREECE				GASTROINTESTINAL ABSORPTION; EXCRETION	Uranium is ubiquitously found in drinking water and food. The gastrointestinal tract absorption fraction (f(1)) is an important parameter in risk assessment of uranium burdens from ingestion. Although absorption of uranium from ingestion has been studied extensively in the past, human data concerning children and adults are still limited. In a previous study based on measurements of uranium concentration in 73 bone-ash samples collected by Health Canada, the absorption fractions for uranium ingestion were determined to be 0.093 +/- 0.113 for infants, and 0.050 +/- 0.032 for young children ranging from 1 to 7 y of age. To extend the study, a total of 69 bone-ash samples were selected for children and adults ranging from 7 to 25 y of age and residing in the same Canadian community that is known to have an elevated level of uranium in its drinking water supply. For each bone-ash sample, the total uranium concentration was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. To solve uranium transfer in the biokinetic model for uranium given in International Commission of Radiological Protection (ICRP) Publication 69 with estimated daily uranium intake, the program WinSAAM v3.0.1 was used. The absorption fractions were determined to be 0.030 +/- 0.022 for children (7-18 y) and 0.021 +/- 0.015 for adults (18-25 y). For anyone more than 18 y of age, the estimated f(1) value for uranium agree well with the ICRP recommended value of 0.02.

ASSESSMENT OF URANIUM EXPOSURE FROM TOTAL ACTIVITY AND U-234:U-238 ACTIVITY RATIOS IN URINE	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	European conference on individual monitoring of ionising radiation (IM)	MAR 08-12, 2010	Athens, GREECE				DEPLETED URANIUM; U-234; TOXICITY; RA-226; TH-230	Radiation workers at Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) are monitored for uranium exposure by routine bioassay sampling (primarily urine sampling). However, the interpretation of uranium in urine and faecal results in terms of occupational intakes is difficult because of the presence of uranium due to intakes from environmental (dietary) sources. For uranium in urine data obtained using current analytical techniques at AWE, the mean, median and standard deviation of excreted uranium concentrations were 0.006, 0.002 and 0.012 mu g per g creatinine, respectively. These values are consistent with what might be expected from local dietary intakes and the knowledge that occupational exposures at AWE are likely to be very low. However, some samples do exceed derived investigation levels (DILs), which have been set up taking account of the likely contribution from environmental sources. We investigate how the activity and isotopic composition of uranium in the diet affects the sensitivity of uranium in urine monitoring for occupational exposures. We conclude that DILs based on both total uranium in urine activity and also U-234:U-238 ratios are useful given the likely variation in dietary contribution for AWE workers. Assuming a background excretion rate and that the enrichment of the likely exposure is known, it is possible to assess exposures using U-234:U-238 ratios and/or total uranium activity. The health implications of internalised uranium, enriched to <5-8 % by mass U-235, centre on its nephrotoxicity; the DILs for bioassay samples at AWE are an order of magnitude below the conservative recommendations made by the literature.

EFFICIENCY CALIBRATION OF A WHOLE-BODY-COUNTING MEASUREMENT SETUP USING A MODULAR PHYSICAL PHANTOM	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	European conference on individual monitoring of ionising radiation (IM)	MAR 08-12, 2010	Athens, GREECE					Physical phantoms are used at whole-body-counting (WBC) laboratories to calibrate detector systems for in vivo monitoring of radionuclides internally deposited in the body. Such phantoms should realistically represent the human body in the selected measurement geometry. In the past, the bottle manikin absorption phantom was used for calibration purposes at the laboratory for Anthropogammametry of SCK.CEN (American National Standard Institute. Specifications for the bottle manikin absorption phantom. ANSI/HPS N13.35, 1999). However, it was considered inadequate because of the leakage risk and the volume of radioactive waste produced at each calibration. As a consequence of this fact, a new phantom was developed. The Emma phantom is made of Epramid blocks (cylinders, cuboids and elliptical cylinders) in which sealed line sources can be introduced. The phantom is modular; so different body geometries can be made. This paper presents the phantom with its sources. The phantom was used to calibrate the SCK.CEN WBC setup. Efficiency calibration curves were obtained for different body geometries. The results of the calibration are discussed.	[Lebacq, A.

The method analyses the frequency distribution for a total number of counts obtained in n measurements performed during n monitoring intervals that are inside the calendar year. Urine sample radiometric measurement technique for plutonium and uranium operating monitoring programmes is investigated, showing dependences of the detection limits on the frequency of measurements, on number of calendar years under observation and on the activity median aerodynamic diameter (AMAD). Only a probability density function (PDF), for the background number of counts, stochastic variability of urine excretion and uncertainty of the intake pattern were taken into account as the main variables influencing the calculated detection limits. But there is no limitation for the proposed method to include the variability of other influencing model parameters in the calculation procedure.	[Molokanov, A. A.; Kukhta, B. A.; Yatsenko, V.

HAIR ANALYSIS AS AN INDICATOR OF EXPOSURE TO URANIUM	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	European conference on individual monitoring of ionising radiation (IM)	MAR 08-12, 2010	Athens, GREECE				DRINKING-WATER; URINE; RADIOACTIVITY; NAILS; AREA	Medical examinations performed on four monks of a monastery in the northern Greece revealed heavy metal contamination. Hair analysis, performed by a toxicological laboratory abroad, indicated, among other, the presence of uranium. The uranium concentrations determined in a laboratory of "Elemental Hair Analysis' indicated a uranium level that was about five times the maximum value of the reference range, which has been adopted by the measuring laboratory. After these diagnostic findings, on request of 10 monks, uranium determination in hair and urine samples was performed by means of alpha spectrometry in GAEC's laboratory. The measured uranium concentrations in hair varied from 0.15 to 2.10 mBq g(-1), which correspond to 12.1 and 170 ng g(-1), respectively. The uranium concentrations in urine were between 41 and 174 ng d(-1). For comparison purposes, urine and non-dyed hair samples from the staff of the laboratory were analysed. Because one of the major sources of uranium intake is through drinking water, water samples were also analysed. The mean value of the uranium concentration in the two drinking water samples collected from the residence area was found to be 2.35 mu g l(-1).

CALIBRATION OF SURFACE CONTAMINATION MONITORS FOR THE DETECTION OF IODINE INCORPORATION IN THE THYROID GLAND	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	European conference on individual monitoring of ionising radiation (IM)	MAR 08-12, 2010	Athens, GREECE				INTERNAL DOSIMETRY; SWITZERLAND	In Switzerland, individuals exposed to the risk of activity intake are required to perform regular monitoring. Monitoring consists in a screening measurement and is meant to be performed using commonly available laboratory instruments. More particularly, iodine intake is measured using a surface contamination monitor. The goal of the present paper is to report the calibration method developed for thyroid screening instruments. It consists of measuring the instrument response to a known activity located in the thyroid gland of a standard neck phantom. One issue of this procedure remains that the iodine radioisotopes have a short half-life. Therefore, the adequacy and limitations to simulate the short-lived radionuclides with so-called mock radionuclides of longer half-life were also evaluated. In light of the results, it has been decided to use only the appropriate iodine sources to perform the calibration.

ETHICAL ISSUES RELATED TO PROFESSIONAL EXPOSURE OF PREGNANT WOMEN IN THE MEDICAL FIELD: MONITORING AND LIMITING EFFECTIVE DOSE	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	European conference on individual monitoring of ionising radiation (IM)	MAR 08-12, 2010	Athens, GREECE					The International Commission on Radiological Protection recommendations for occupational exposed pregnant women do not imply necessarily the complete avoidance of work with radiation or radioactive materials. Instead, a careful review of the exposure conditions, once the pregnancy is declared, as part of the exercise of the ICRP optimisation principle (based in a teleological ethics point of view) is suggested. The dose limitation (following a deontological ethics point of view) of the fetus/embryo is, however, not clearly well established as happens in the case of workers or members of the public. Also, the justification of practices (to continue to work or not with radiation or radioactive materials) is not clearly addressed in most national or international recommendations. An analysis of this justification (bearing in mind both teleological and deontological ethics) is examined in this work having in mind the best interest of the child-to-be as well as other existing social and economical factors.

The main objectives of an individual monitoring programme are outlined, and types of malevolent use scenario briefly described. Some major challenges facing those with responsibilities for planning the monitoring response to such an incident are identified and discussed. These include the need for rapid selection and prioritisation of people for individual monitoring by means of an effective triage system; the need for rapid initiation of individual monitoring; problems associated with monitoring large numbers of people; the particular difficulties associated with incidents involving pure-beta and alpha-emitting radionuclides; the need for techniques that can provide retrospective estimates of external radiation exposures rapidly and the need for rapid interpretation of contamination monitoring data. The paper concludes with a brief review of assistance networks and relevant international projects planned or currently underway.	[Etherington, G.; Rothkamm, K.; Shutt, A. L.; Youngman, M.

ASSESSMENT OF THE TOTAL EFFECTIVE DOSE OF MINERS IN THE UNDERGROUND ROZNA URANIUM MINE IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC DURING THE PERIOD 2004-2009	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	European conference on individual monitoring of ionising radiation (IM)	MAR 08-12, 2010	Athens, GREECE					The paper discusses the situation in the Czech Republic regarding past and present uranium mining activities with emphasis on the evaluation of the exposure of underground miners in the Rozna Uranium Mine, which is currently the only active mine in the country and practically in the entire European Union. The total effective dose has been summarised taking into account all three major components, namely radon short-lived decay products, long-lived alpha emitters in ore dust and penetrating external gamma radiation. The average and maximum values of the effective dose as well as the collective effective dose of underground miners are also presented. The purpose of the paper is to document the miners' exposures during a period of 6 years in a uranium mine where conditions including the ore grade and methods of mining showed recently some changes that may affect the individual components of the total effective dose.

The method comprised the prediction of the radiation levels, the design of special shielding structures and the occupational dose assessment. Activation calculations were performed using the FISPACT code to predict the source term. Monte Carlo simulations using MCNP code were utilized to estimate the ambient dose equivalent rates. The results of the calculations were verified by measurements and were found to be in good agreement. Thermoluminescence dosemeter (TLD) and electronic personal dosemeter (EPD) were implemented to measure the radiation exposure of the workers. The total collective dose of 14 participating workers was 0.15 man mSv. The maximum individual effective dose was 0.02 mSv, and the maximum extremity equivalent dose was 0.09 mSv. The discussed method provides a useful tool enabling work planning during reactor decommissioning and renovation activities ensuring that exposures will be maintained ALARA.

CHROMOSOMAL ABERRATION ANALYSIS AMONG UNDERGROUND WATER WELLWORKERS IN SAUDI ARABIA	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	European conference on individual monitoring of ionising radiation (IM)	MAR 08-12, 2010	Athens, GREECE				RADIATION; GROUNDWATER; INSTABILITY; WORKERS; DAMAGE; RISK	In the absence of permanent rivers or bodies of water, half of the Saudi Arabia domestic water consumption is provided through desalination. The other half is derived from groundwater. Groundwater from the Disi aquifer is already used for drinking water in parts of Jordan and, more extensively, in Saudi Arabia, where it is known as the Saq aquifer. Some of the geological analyses of the host sandstone aquifer rocks show Ra-228 and Ra-226. The usefulness of chromosomal aberrations analysis as a bioindicator for ionising radiation effect was tested in underground water well workers of Saudi Arabia in this industry producing technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material. The incidence of chromosomal aberrations was evaluated using the metaphase analysis method in the lymphocytes of peripheral blood of 10 persons working in underground water well. The age range of the workers was 25-40 y and their duration of service ranged from 3-7 y. For comparison, blood samples were also collected from 10 subjects (controls) who belonged to same age and socioeconomic status. Subjects in the both groups were non-smokers and non-alcoholics. Results showed that the mean frequencies of dicentrics and acentrics in underground water well workers are significantly higher than those in controls. The higher frequency of chromosomal aberration in lymphocytes of underground water well workers compared with controls could be due to the accumulative effect of radiation. The results of this study demonstrated that occupational exposure to radiation leads to a significant induction of cytogenetic damage in peripheral lymphocytes of workers engaged in underground water well.

High sensitivity and lack of false alarms are all important for environmental air monitors. The project aims to conduct investigations to improve operation of environmental air monitors, particularly under conditions where a lot of non-radioactive dust may be deposited on the filters (conditions of high dust loading). The dust may increase the frequency with which filters must be changed and can lead to an underestimation of the real activity. This underestimation is due to deteriorated alpha energy resolution and response specificity to the radionuclides of interest.

ASSESSMENT OF THE OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE AT A FERTILISER INDUSTRY IN THE NORTHERN PART OF GREECE	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	European conference on individual monitoring of ionising radiation (IM)	MAR 08-12, 2010	Athens, GREECE					In the northern part of Greece, close to the city of Kavala, a phosphoric acid production industry has operated since 1965. The raw material used is the phosphate rock imported from the foreign countries. During industrial processes, naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) deposits exist in many facilities in the industry, causing increased levels of radiation exposure. Additionally, increased levels of NORM concentrations are also detected in the waste material of the production process, the phosphogypsum. According to the Greek Regulations for Radiation Protection (no. 216B, 5/3/2001), which is in accordance with the 96/29/EURATOM 31/5/1996, the action levels concerning the effective dose to workers at workplaces due to natural radiation sources are 1 mSv y(-1). Work activities where the corresponding doses exceed 6 mSv y(-1) are under the control of the Greek Atomic Energy Commission (GAEC). The mean yearly radon concentration action level at workplaces is 400 Bq m(-3), while the corresponding concentration limit is 3000 Bq m(-3), respectively. GAEC, according to its constitutional law, is the responsible organisation to enforce and to implement the law by means of in situ surveys and laboratory measurements. The first inspection of the area was performed in 2002 and the first measures were proposed. Periodic inspections were performed every 2 y in order to extend the operation licensing of the industry. In this work a dose assessment of the workers based on in situ and laboratory measurements is presented. In order to assess the doses to the workers the external and the internal doses are estimated.

The reactor has been utilized for various neutron irradiation tests on nuclear fuels and materials, as well as for radioisotope production. The operation of JMTR stopped temporarily in August 2006 for refurbishment and improvement. The renewed JMTR will resume operation in Japanese fiscal year 2011. For the resumption of the new JMTR, the new irradiation facilities, the usability improvements, the target, and the expected roles of the new JMTR have been discussed. As one of the new irradiation facilities, the cryogenic irradiation facility, which is used for the investigation on the low-temperature irradiation behavior of materials such as superconducting magnet materials for fusion reactors, has been desired. In this study, the feasibility of low-temperature irradiation tests with the cryogenic irradiation facility was investigated, and the conceptual design of the facility was carried out. As a result, it was found that irradiation tests at temperatures below 20K for the development of the superconducting magnet materials can be realized by the installation of an irradiation capsule into an irradiation hole with low gamma heating and by the adoption of vacuum jacketed tubes to connect between the capsule and a cooling system.

A study on influence of heat input variation on microstructure of reduced activation ferritic martensitic steel weld metal produced by GTAW process	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						RAFM steel; Heat input; delta ferrite; Hardness; Cooling rate	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; FERRITIC/MARTENSITIC STEELS; CHROMIUM; BEHAVIOR; PHASE	Reduced activation ferritic martensitic (RAFM) steel is a major structural material for test blanket module (TBM) to be incorporated in International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) programme to study the breeding of tritium in fusion reactors. This material has been mainly developed to achieve significant reduction in the induced radioactivity from the structural material used. Fabrication of TBM involves extensive welding, and gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process is one of the welding processes being considered for this purpose. In the present work, the effect of heat input on microstructure of indigenously developed RAFM steel weld metal produced by GTAW process has been studied. Autogenous bead-on-plate welding, autogenous butt-welding, butt-welding with filler wire addition, and pulsed welding on RAFMS have been carried out using GTAW process respectively. The weld metal is found to contain delta-ferrite and its volume fraction increased with increase in heat input. This fact suggests that delta-ferrite content in the weld metal is influenced by the cooling rate during welding. It was also observed that the hardness of the weld metal decreased with increase in delta-ferrite content. This paper highlights the effect of heat input and PWHT duration on microstructure and hardness of welds. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Arivazhagan, B.; Srinivasan, G.; Albert, S.

Assessment of tritium levels in rivers and precipitation in north-western Greece before the ITER operation	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						Tritium; Liquid scintillation counting; River water; Rain water; Residence time; Cluster analysis; Factor analysis	CARBONATE AQUIFERS; ISOTOPE HYDROLOGY; POWER-PLANTS; WATER; GROUNDWATER; BASIN; H-3; BALANCE; SAMPLES; SAFETY	The project ITER aims to demonstrate that fusion is the energy source of the future. The prototype Tokamak machine is intended to start operation at about 2019 and tritium is one of the major contaminants that can be accidentally released in the environment. Nowadays environmental tritium levels are of natural origin except in the vicinity of nuclear facilities. The evaluation of background tritium levels is essential in the context of a future possibility of accidental tritium releases. For this purpose and also because of the lack of relevant information, an extended programme of river and rain water sampling was implemented in north-western Greece. Water samples from six major rivers in this area and rain water samples were analysed for tritium content. The rivers under investigation were Aliakmonas River, Pinios River, Arachthos River, Kalamas River, Aoos River and Louros River, which originate from the central Greek mountain range Pindos, and flow to Aegean and Ionian Sea. The tritium concentrations were determined by the Liquid Scintillator Analyser Tri-Carb 3170TR/SL. The statistical analysis of data revealed that there is a seasonal variation of tritium concentration in rain samples and a less pronounced seasonal variation in river samples. The weighted mean tritium concentration for rain samples was determined equal to 0.90 +/- 0.08 Bq L-1 (7.6 +/- 0.7 TU) and the respective mean value for river samples was 0.94 +/- 0.04 Bq L-1 (7.9 +/- 0.3 TU). Further analysis has demonstrated that river waters tend to show lower tritium concentrations than the concurrently measured tritium concentrations in rain samples, during spring and summer (at 47% and 71% of the sampling stations, respectively), while this observation is reversed during autumn and winter (at 44% and 35% of the sampling stations, respectively). This may be attributed to rain water remaining underground for a long period allowing tritium to decay and when it reappears as river water, the tritium concentration values are lower when compared to the rain water concentrations. Rough estimates of the residence time of underground waters in the study area provided values, which ranged from 0.5 to 11.7 years, with a mean value of 5.2 +/- 0.9 years. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Energy multiplication in a fusion-fission (hybrid) reactor could lead earlier market penetration of fusion energy for commercial utilization. Originally, scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) have worked out a hybrid reactor design concept; the so-called Laser Inertial Confinement Fusion-Fission Energy (LIFE) engine, which has consisted of a spherical fusion chamber of similar to 5 m diameter, surrounded by a multi-layered blanket with a beryllium multiplier zone after the first wall. However, earlier work had indicated extreme power peaks at immediate vicinity of the first wall of a hybrid assembly, if a beryllium multiplier is used. Hence, in the current work, the beryllium multiplier zone has been removed in order to mitigate fission power peaks at the vicinity of the first wall as a result of neutron moderation on beryllium. Furthermore, minor actinides (MA) will cause significant neutron multiplication under fusion neutron irradiation so that an extra beryllium multiplier will not be needed. Present work has made following modifications on the LLNL design of the original (LIFE) engine: Omission of beryllium multiplier. TRISO fuel has been suspended as micro-size particles in Flibe coolant in lieu of being dissolved in uranium salt or imbedded carbon matrix in macro-size pebbles. Carbide fuel is used. Fissionable fuel charge is kept lower than in the LLNL (LIFE) engine. The modified (LIFE) engine is kept similar to the LLNL design to a great degree in order to allow mutual feedback between two geographically separated teams towards a more advanced and improved design under consideration of totally independent views. The first wall is made of ODS (2 cm) and followed by a Li17Pbg3 zone (2 cm), acting as neutron multiplier, tritium breeding and front coolant zone. It is separated by an ODS layer (2 cm) from the Flibe molten salt zone (50 cm), containing MA as fissionable fuel. A 3rd ODS layer (2 cm) separates the molten salt zone on the right side from the graphite reflector (30 cm). Calculations have been conducted for a fusion driver power of 500 MWth in S-8-P-3 approximation using 238-neutron groups. Minor actinides (MA) out of the nuclear waste of LWRs are used as fissile carbide fuel in TRISO particles with volume fractions of 0,2,3,4 and 5% have been dispersed homogenously in the Flibe coolant. For these cases, tritium breeding at startup is calculated as TBR= 1.134, 1.286, 1.387, 1.52 and 1.67, respectively. In the course of plant operation, TBR and fissile neutron multiplication factor decrease gradually. For a self-sustained reactor, TBR > 1.05 can be kept for all cases over 8 years. Higher fissionable fuel content in the molten salt leads also to higher blanket energy multiplication, namely M = 3.3, 4.6, 6.15 and 8.1 with 2, 3, 4 and 5% TRISO volume fraction at start up, respectively. For all investigated cases, fissile burn up exceeds 400000 MW D/MT. Major damage mechanisms have been calculated as DPA = 50 and He = 176 appm per year. This implies a replacement of the first wall every 3 years. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
