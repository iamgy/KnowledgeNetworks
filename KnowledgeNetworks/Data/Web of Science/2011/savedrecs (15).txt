Towards possible opportunities in nuclear materials science and technology at an X-ray free electron laser research facility	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							BOILING HEAT-TRANSFER; DISPLACEMENT CASCADES; ABSORPTION-SPECTROSCOPY; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; NANOCRYSTALLINE NI; RADIATION-DAMAGE; ENERGY; IRON; CRYSTALLOGRAPHY; SCATTERING	Spectroscopy and imaging of condensed matter have benefited greatly from the availability of intense X-ray beams from synchrotron sources, both in terms of spatial resolution and of elemental specificity. The advent of the X-ray free electron laser (X-ray FEL) provides the additional features of ultra-short pulses and high transverse coherence, which greatly expand possibilities to study dynamic processes and to image non-crystalline materials. The proposed SwissFEL facility at the Paul Scherrer Institute is one of at present four X-ray FEL projects worldwide and is scheduled to go into operation in the year 2017. This article describes a selection of problems in nuclear materials science and technology that would directly benefit from this and similar X-ray FEL sources. X-ray FEL-based experiments are proposed to be conducted on nuclear energy-related materials using single-shot X-ray spectroscopy, coherent X-ray scattering and/or X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy in order to address relevant scientific questions such as the evolution in time of the irradiation-induced damage processes, the deformation processes in nuclear materials, the ion diffusion processes in the barrier systems of geological repositories, the boiling heat transfer in nuclear reactors, as well as the structural characterization of graphite dust in advanced nuclear reactors and clay colloid aggregates in the groundwater near a radioactive waste repository.

EXPERIMENTAL SIMULATION OF PERSONAL DOSIMETRY IN PRODUCTION OF MEDICAL RADIOISOTOPES BY RESEARCH REACTOR	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							LIF-MG,CU,P	Due to their work conditions, research reactor personnel are exposed to ionising nuclear radiations. Because the absorbed dose values are different for different tissues due to variations in sensitivity, in this work personal dosimetry has been performed under normal working conditions at anatomical locations relevant to more sensitive tissues as well as for the whole body by employing a Rando phantom and thermoluminescent dosemeters (TLDs). Fifty-two TLDs-100H were positioned at high-risk organ locations such as the thyroid, eyes as well as the left breast, which was used to assess the whole-body dose in order to study the absorbed doses originating from selected locations in the vicinity of the reactor. The results have employed the tissue weighting factors based on International Commission on Radiological Protection ICRP 103 and ICRP 60 and the measured results were below the dose limits recommended by ICRP. The mean effective dose rates calculated from ICRP 103 were the following: whole body, 30.64-6.44 mu Sv h(-1); thyroid, 1.22-0.23 mu Sv h(-1); prostate, 0.085-0.045 mu Sv h(-1); gonads, 1.00-0.51 mu Sv h(-1); breast, 3.68-0.77 mu Sv h(-1); and eyes, 33.74-7.01 mu Sv h(-1).

MONTE CARLO ESTIMATION OF DOSE DIFFERENCE IN LUNG FROM Ir-192 BRACHYTHERAPY DUE TO TISSUE INHOMOGENEITY	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							DOSIMETRY	Lung brachytherapy using high-dose rate Ir-192 technique is a well-established technique of radiation therapy. However, many commercial treatment planning systems do not have the ability to consider the inhomogeneity of lung in relation to normal tissue. Under such circumstances dose calculations for tissues and organs at risk close to the target are inaccurate. The purpose of the current study was to estimate the dose difference due to tissue inhomogeneity using the Monte Carlo simulation code MCNP-5. Results showed that there was a relative sub dosage by treatment planning systems calculations in neighbouring tissues around the radioactive source due to inhomogeneity ignorance. The presence of lung instead of normal tissue resulted in an increase in relative dose, which approached 8 % at 4-cm distance from the source. Additionally, the relative increase was small for the lung (2.1 %) and larger for organs at risk such as the heart (6.8 %) and bone marrow (7.6 %).

PERFORM 60: Prediction of the effects of radiation for reactor pressure vessel and in-core materials using multi-scale modelling-60 years foreseen plant lifetime	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th European Commission Conference on Euratom Research and Training in Reactor Systems (FISA) on Nuclear Engineering and Design	JUN 22-24, 2009	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Czech Presidency European Union			KINETIC MONTE-CARLO; DISLOCATION DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; PWR-RELEVANT CONDITIONS; AB-INITIO; CRACK-PROPAGATION; PERFECT PLATFORM; MODEL ALLOYS; RPV STEELS; IRRADIATION; FE	In nuclear power plants, materials undergo degradation due to severe irradiation conditions that may limit their operational lifetime. Utilities that operate these reactors need to quantify the ageing and potential degradation of certain essential structures of the power plant to ensure their safe and reliable operation. So far, the monitoring and mitigation of these degradation phenomena rely mainly on long-term irradiation programs in test reactors as well as on mechanical or corrosion testing in specialized hot cells. Continuous progress in the physical understanding of the phenomena involved in irradiation damage and progress in computer sciences have now made possible the development of multi-scale numerical tools able to simulate the materials behaviour in a nuclear environment. Indeed, within the PERFECT project of the EURATOM framework program (FP6), a first step has been successfully reached through the development of a simulation platform that contains several advanced numerical tools aiming at the prediction of irradiation damage in both the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) and its internals using available, state-of-the-art-knowledge. These tools allow simulation of irradiation effects on the nanostructure and the constitutive behaviour of the RPV low alloy steels, as well as their fracture mechanics properties. For the more highly irradiated reactor internals, which are commonly produced using austenitic stainless steels, the first partial models were established, describing radiation effects on the nanostructure and providing a first description of the stress corrosion behaviour of these materials in a primary coolant environment. Recently, relying on the existing PERFECT Roadmap, the FP7 Collaborative Project PERFORM 60 was launched with the overall objective of building on the success of PERFECT to develop similar tools that would allow simulation of the combined effects of irradiation and corrosion on internals, in addition to a further improvement of the existing tools which model irradiation effects in RPV bainitic steels. From a managerial viewpoint, PERFORM 60 is based on two technical sub-projects, namely (i) RPV and (ii) Internals. In addition, a User's Group and training scheme have been initiated in order to allow representatives of constructors, utilities, research organizations, etc. from Europe, USA and Japan to participate actively in the process of appraising the limits and potentialities of the developed tools and to assess their validation against qualified experimental data. Furthermore, significant efforts are being made to share knowledge and experience with young researchers in the field of nuclear materials degradation and to disseminate the results as widely as possible both within the project, and in international conferences, peer reviewed journals and via a dedicated website, that the latter serving as an 'open window' for internal communications and as a close link with similar projects underway worldwide. PERFORM 60 officially kicked off on March 1st, 2009 for a duration of 4 years. There are 20 participants.

ACSEPT-Partitioning technologies and actinide science: Towards pilot facilities in Europe	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th European Commission Conference on Euratom Research and Training in Reactor Systems (FISA) on Nuclear Engineering and Design	JUN 22-24, 2009	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Czech Presidency European Union				Actinide recycling by separation and transmutation is considered worldwide and particularly in several European countries as one of the most promising strategies to reduce the inventory of radioactive waste and to optimise the use of natural resources. With its multidisciplinary consortium of 34 partners from 12 European countries plus Australia and Japan, the European Research Project ACSEPT (Actinide recycling by SEParation and Transmutation) aims at contributing to the development of this strategy by studying both hydrometallurgical and pyrochemical partitioning routes. ACSEPT is organised into three technical domains: (i) Considering technically mature aqueous separation processes, ACSEPT works to optimise and select the most promising ones dedicated either to actinide partitioning (for the heterogeneous recycling of actinides in ADS target or specific actinide bearing blanket fuels in fast reactor) or to grouped actinide separation (for the homogeneous recycling of the actinides in fast reactor fuels). In addition, dissolution and conversion studies are underway taking into account the specific requirements of these specific fuels. (ii) Concerning pyrochemical separation processes. ACSEPT focuses on the enhancement of the two reference cores processes selected within FP6-EUROPART. R&D efforts are also devoted to key scientific and technical issues compulsory to set up a complete separation process (head-end steps, salt treatment for recycling and waste management). (iii) By integrating all the experimental results in engineering and system studies, both in hydro and pyro domains, ACSEPT will deliver relevant flowsheets and recommendations to prepare for future demonstrations at a pilot level. After more than two years of work, significant progress was achieved in process development with the demonstration of the SANEX and innovative SANEX flowsheets. Chemical systems were selected for GANEX and are under study. In addition, efforts were made to increase collaborations, mutualise and homogenise procedures and share good practices. Based on these assessments, it is now time to look at the future challenges to overcome. A training and education program is implemented to share the knowledge among the partitioning community, present and future generations of researchers. Specific attention is paid to the funding of post-doctorate fellowships, two having been appointed respectively at the end of 2008 and at the end of 2009. Through this training and education programme, the first ACSEPT International Workshop was organised last March in Lisbon, Portugal. It gave an emphasis to young researchers' contributions (two thirds of the contributions) and allowed young scientists to meet and exchange with international recognised experts.

Impact of partitioning and transmutation on the high level waste management	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th European Commission Conference on Euratom Research and Training in Reactor Systems (FISA) on Nuclear Engineering and Design	JUN 22-24, 2009	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Czech Presidency European Union				Nuclear energy generates 30% of the electricity in the EU. Still, different countries of EU27 have very different attitudes towards the future use of nuclear energy for electricity generation or other uses. However, independently of the political decision of continuation or phase out of the nuclear energy, all countries using nuclear energy to generate electricity are facing the question of the final management of its spent nuclear fuel and other high level radioactive wastes. Partition and Transmutation are emerging technologies that when integrated in advanced fuel cycles can strongly influence on the final wastes from the nuclear industry and its management. A review of the progress on the understanding of their real potentialities and main conclusions from a large number of international studies are presented in this paper. In particular, the conclusions from the main NEA working groups and the EURATOM RED-IMPACT project are jointly discussed. In this paper the emphasis is put on the effects of Partitioning and Transmutation on the inventory reduction, the heat source reduction and its implications to the repository capacity and on the performance assessment of the final repository.

The ELSY (European Lead-cooled System) reference design is a 600 MWe pool-type reactor cooled by pure lead. The ELSY project demonstrates the possibility of designing a competitive and safe fast critical reactor using simple engineered technical features, while fully complying with the Generation IV goal of sustainability and minor actinide (MA) burning capability. Sustainability was a leading criterion for option selection for core design, focusing on the demonstration of the potential to be self sustaining in plutonium and to burn its own generated MAs. To this end, different core configurations have been studied. Economics was a leading criterion for primary system design and plant layout. The use of a compact and simple primary circuit with the additional objective that all internal components be removable, are among the reactor features intended to assure competitive electric energy generation and long-term investment protection. Low capital cost and construction time are pursued through simplicity and compactness of the reactor building (reduced footprint and height). The reduced plant footprint is one of the benefits coming from the elimination of the Intermediate Cooling System, the low reactor building height is the result of the design approach which foresees the adoption of short-height components and two innovative Decay Heat Removal (DHR) systems. Among the critical issues, the impact of the large mass of lead has been carefully analyzed; it has been demonstrated that the high density of lead can be mitigated by compact solutions and adoption of seismic isolators. Safety has been one of the major focuses all over the ELSY development. In addition to the inherent safety advantages of lead coolant (high boiling point and no exothermic reactions with air or water) a high safety grade of the overall system has been reached. In fact the overall primary system has been conceived in order to minimize pressure drops and, as a consequence, to allow decay heat removal by natural circulation. Moreover two redundant, diverse and passive operated DHR systems have been developed and adopted. The paper presents the overall work performed so far. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In common with other fast reactors, gas-cooled fast reactors (GFRs) have exceptional potential as sustainable energy sources, for both the utilisation of fissile material and minimisation of nuclear waste through transmutation of minor actinides. The primary goal of GFR research is to develop the system primarily to be a reliable and economic electricity generator, with good safety and sustainability characteristics. However, for the longer term, GFR retains the potential for hydrogen production and other process heat applications facilitated through a high core outlet temperature which, in this case, is not limited by the characteristics of the coolant. In this respect. GFR can inherit the non-electricity applications of the thermal HTRs in a sustainable manner in a future in which natural uranium becomes scarce. GFR research within Europe is performed directly by those states who have signed the "System Arrangement" document within the Generation IV International Forum (the GIF), specifically France and Switzerland and Euratom. Importantly, Euratom provides a route by which researchers in other European states, and other non-European affiliates, can contribute to the work of the GIF, even when these states are not signatories to the GFR System Arrangement in their own right. This paper is written from the perspective of Euratom's involvement in research on the GFR system, starting with the 5th Framework Programme (FP5) GCFR project in 2000, through the FP6 project between 2005 and 2009 and looking ahead to the proposed activities within the current 7th Framework Programme (FP7). The evolution of the GFR concept from the 1960s onwards is discussed briefly, followed by the current perceived role, objectives and progress with the Generation IV GFR system. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Its main objective is the preservation and further development of expertise in the nuclear fields by higher education and training. This objective is realized through the cooperation between EU universities involved in education and research in nuclear disciplines, nuclear research centers and the nuclear industry. As of May 2009, the ENEN has 47 members in 17 EU countries. Since 2007 the ENEN Association has concluded a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with partners beyond Europe for further cooperation, such as South Africa, Russian Federation and Japan. The ENEN has good collaboration with national networks and international organizations, like Belgian Nuclear Education Network (BNEN) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The ENEN has provided support to its Members for the organization of and participation to selected E&T courses in nuclear fields. Based on the mutual recognition of those courses, the ENEN developed a reference curriculum in nuclear engineering, consisting of a core package of courses and optional substitute courses in nuclear disciplines, to be realized as the European Master of Science in Nuclear Engineering (EMSNE). From the experience gained through the EMSNE, a European Master of Science in Nuclear Disciplines will be delivered in the near future, extending ENEN's certification to other disciplines such as radiation protection and waste management and disposal. The ENEN-II Coordination Action consolidated and expanded the achievements of the ENEN and the NEPTUNO projects attained by the ENEN in respectively the 5th and 6th Framework Programmes. The objective of the ENEN-II project was to develop the ENEN Association in a sustainable way in the areas of nuclear engineering, radiation protection and radioactive waste management, including underground disposal. The current developments in the 7th FP show that this has partially been achieved. Indeed, the interaction between the different communities, engineering, radiation protection and waste management, has been considerably strengthened. The training scheme projects ENEN-III, PETRUS-II and ENETRAP-II now starting under the 7th FP are distinct activities, which have been prepared in mutual consultation by the three communities and the ENEN Association is a partner in the three consortia, assuming a pivotal role in the coordination and streamlining of education and training activities in the European Union. In December 2008 the EU Council welcomed the existence within the EU of coordinated teaching and training leading to qualifications in the nuclear field, provided notably by the ENEN, and expressed its hope that, with the help of the EU, ENEN and its members will continue to develop the coordination of nuclear education and training in Europe (COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION 15406/08 "The Needs for Skills in the Nuclear Field"). The ENEN endeavours to respond to their expectations in the years to come. The ENEN has been actively participating in the Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology Platform (SNE-TP) and co-chairing the Education, Training and Knowledge Management Working Group. It has also contribute to the European Nuclear Energy Forum (ENEF) activities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Calculation of heat capacity of the nuclear fuels UO2 and NpO2 using integer and non-integer n-dimensional Debye functions	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Review							INCOMPLETE GAMMA FUNCTIONS; THERMOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES; THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; ACTINIDE DIOXIDES; X-RAY; GRUNEISEN CONSTANT; TEMPERATURE; DIFFRACTION	In the present study, the heat capacities of the nuclear fuels were computed using the series expansion relation for integer and non-integer n-dimensional Debye functions involving binomial coefficients and incomplete gamma functions. The proposed approach is novel as it uses the non-integer n-dimensional Debye functions for accurate calculations of the heat capacities C-V and C-P. The algorithm is used to simulate the variation of the heat capacities with temperature dependence of the nuclear fuels UO2 and NpO2. Analysis using computer simulation proved that the formula was in excellent agreement with the results reported in the literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Eser, E.; Mamedov, B.

J	Hawkins, BJ; Knight, TW				Hawkins, Benjamin J.; Knight, Travis W.			Characterization of radiation fields and dose assessment from fuels manufacturing for advanced fuel cycles	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								The purpose of this study was to examine radiological hazards introduced to workers from the fabrication of fuels with minor actinides (MA) and reprocessed uranium (RepU) and determine the feasibility of using shielded gloveboxes instead of remotely controlled operations in hot cells. Of particular concern is the increase in photon source term from the daughter products in RepU and the mixed neutron and photon fields introduced by MA recycle. In the interest of keeping the glovebox worker's radiation dose as low as reasonable achievable (ALARA), dose rates were calculated for various typical and bounding fuel compositions for light water reactors (LWR) and fast reactor (FR) mixed oxide (MOX) fuels with and without MA. The impact of varying the separation efficiency of americium (Am) and curium (Cm) was examined because current separation processes in reprocessing and recycling do not allow for the complete separation of Am from Cm. The additional Cm will cause a significant increase in the neutron source term. The sensitivity of the fuels to aging time was also examined by decaying the recycled feedstocks from 6 months to 3 years to simulate the effect of delays in reuse of recycled materials. The highest photon and neutron sources were used to calculate the additional shielding requirements that would be needed for fuel fabrication. Through insight gained from this study, it can be concluded that a standard glovebox with one quarter inch stainless steel walls can be used to fabricate fuels with Am with little to no additional shielding. The introduction of small amounts of Cm in the fuels will require the fuel fabrication to be preformed remotely in hot cells. Thus, stressing the importance of developing methods to increase the separation efficiency of Am from Cm. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The reactor physics characteristics of a transuranic mixed oxide fuel in a heavy water moderated reactor	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								The reprocessing actinide materials extracted from spent fuel for use in mixed oxide fuels is a key component in maximizing the spent fuel repository utility. While fast spectrum reactor technologies are being considered in order to close the fuel cycle, and transmute these actinides, there is potential to utilize existing pressurized heavy water reactors such as the CANDU (R)(1) design to meet these goals. The use of current thermal reactors as an intermediary step which can burn actinide based fuels can significantly reduce the fast reactor infrastructure needed. This paper examines the features of actinide mixed oxide fuel. TRUMOX, in a typical CANDU nuclear reactor. The actinide concentrations used were based on extraction from 30 year cooled spent fuel and mixed with natural uranium in 4.75% actinide MOX fuel. The WIMS-AECL model of the fuel lattice was created and the two neutron group properties were transferred to RFSP in order to create a 3 dimensional time average full core model. The model was created with typical CANDU limits on bundle and channel powers and a burnup target of 45 MWd/kgHE. The TRUMOX fuel design achieved its goals and performed well under normal operations simulations. This effort demonstrated the feasibility of using the current fleet of CANDU reactors as an intermediary step in burning reprocessed spent fuel and reducing actinide burdens within the end repository. The recycling, reprocessing and reuse of spent fuels produces a much more sustainable and efficient nuclear fuel cycle using existing and proven reactor technologies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Coupled neutronic thermo-hydraulic analysis of full PWR core with Monte-Carlo based BGCore system	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								BGCore reactor analysis system was recently developed at Ben-Gurion University for calculating in-core fuel composition and spent fuel emissions following discharge. It couples the Monte Carlo transport code MCNP with an independently developed burnup and decay module SARAF. Most of the existing MCNP based depletion codes (e.g. MOCUP, Monteburns, MCODE) tally directly the one-group fluxes and reaction rates in order to prepare one-group cross sections necessary for the fuel depletion analysis. BGCore, on the other hand, uses a multi-group (MG) approach for generation of one group cross-sections. This coupling approach significantly reduces the code execution time without compromising the accuracy of the results. Substantial reduction in the BGCore code execution time allows consideration of problems with much higher degree of complexity, such as introduction of thermal hydraulic (TH) feedback into the calculation scheme. Recently, a simplified TH feedback module, THERMO, was developed and integrated into the BGCore system. To demonstrate the capabilities of the upgraded BGCore system, a coupled neutronic TH analysis of a full PWR core was performed. The BGCore results were compared with those of the state of the art 3D deterministic nodal diffusion code DYN3D (Grundmann et al., 2000). Very good agreement in major core operational parameters including k-eff eigenvalue, axial and radial power profiles, and temperature distributions between the BGCore and DYN3D results was observed. This agreement confirms the consistency of the implementation of the TH feedback module. Although the upgraded BGCore system is capable of performing both, depletion and TH analyses, the calculations in this study were performed for the beginning of cycle state with pre-generated fuel compositions.

J	Kim, TM; Park, JH				Kim, Tech-Mo; Park, Jong-Ho			A containment analysis for SBLOCA in the refurbished Wolsong-1 Nuclear Power Plant	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								A small break leading to a loss of coolant accident (SBLOCA), being one of the topic accidents in the nuclear plant diagnosis in recent years, has been analysed and evaluated for the refurbished Wolsong-1 Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). The Industry Standard Toolset (IST) codes developed by CANDU (Canadian Deuterium Uranium reactor) Owners Group and updated models including design change parameters are applied newly to the event analyses. The GOTHIC code has been used for the containment thermal-hydraulic analysis of Wolsong-1. Also, the SMART-IST code fitted in the Iodine Chemistry (IMOD-2) model has been used to predict nuclide behavior within the containment considering various aspects. The IMOD-2 was incorporated into SMART-IST as a module dealing with chemical transformations and mass transfer of iodine species in containment. IMOD-2 model is very sensitive to paint and chemicals. The parametric studies for the IMOD-2 model are performed to decide the analysis value set. The iodine release amount increases as the paint thickness increases. But, the iodine release amount increases as the water pH (dousing and primary heat transport (PHT)) decreases. The developed containment analysis methodology and the results of SBLOCA without Emergency Coolant Injection (ECI) are presented herein. Under the most heat-up conditions, the radionuclide release from the failed fuel into the containment and subsequently to the environment is such that the radioactive doses to the public are below the acceptable limits.

Parametric analyses of partial sub-assembly blockages of the 50 MWth gas cooled experimental technology and demonstrator reactor (ETDR)	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							STAINLESS-STEEL; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; FUEL RODS; BEHAVIOR; CRACKING	This paper presents a parametric study of thermal hydraulic and structural mechanic analyses of accidental blockages of the hottest sub-assembly of the 50 MWth gas-cooled fast reactor, ETDR. The blockage ratios were 60% and 100% of the sub-assembly flow cross-section located at the first row of grid spacers. Temperature profiles in the fuel and cladding were calculated as a function of time using computational fluid dynamics. The results were incorporated into finite elements analyses to evaluate thermal and mechanical stresses and strains in the cladding and fuel. 2D simulations with generalized plane strains were used in the structural analyses applying the maximum power density in the pellet as calculated by CFD. The thermal analyses showed that a 60% partial blockage increases the maximum cladding temperature by 130 degrees C within a time period of 50 s, whereas a full blockage will lead to clad melting (1320 degrees C) in about 8 s after accident initiation. In the finite element analyses several, mainly conservative, assumptions have been made to incorporate the phenomena occurring in the pellet-cladding interaction. The results of the finite element analyses represent a first study of the pellet-cladding mechanical interface under given transients, exploring the development of a methodology to be used for future analyses. The model has been verified to predict realistic contact stresses in line with analytical solutions during partial or full blockages. However, more elaborate 2D and 3D contact models, with creep and irradiation creep material models for both fuel and clad, together with parametric studies on friction coefficients and number of fuel fragments are foreseen for future work on failure criteria.

This study intends to evaluate the thermal-fluid and safety characteristics of TRU fuel in a DB-HTR core using GAMMA+ code. The key design characteristics of the DB-HTR core are more fuel rings (five fuel-rings), less central reflectors (three rings) and decay power curves due to the TRU fuel compositions that are different from the UO(2) fuel. This study considered three types of TRU kernel compositions such as 100%(PuO(2) + NpO(2) + Am), 99.8%(PuO(1.8), NpO(2)) + 0.2%UO(2) + 0.6 mole SiC getter, and 70%(PuO(1.8), NpO(2))+ 30%UO(2) + 0.6 mole SiC getter. The first fuel type of TRU kernel produces higher decay power than the UO(2) kernel. For the second and the third fuel types, removing the initial Am isotopes and reducing the volumetric packing fraction of TRISO particles will reduce the decay power. The flow distribution, core temperature and TRISO temperature profiles at the steady state were examined. As a safety performance, this study mainly evaluated the peak fuel temperature during LPCC (low pressure conduction cooling) event with considering the impact of decay power, the annealing effect of the irradiated thermal conductivity of graphite, and the impact of the FB (fuel block) end-flux-peaking. For the 600 MW(th) DB-HTR core, the peak fuel temperature of 100%(PuO(2)+ NpO(2) + Am) TRU was found to be much higher than the transient fuel design limit of 1600 degrees C due to the lack of heat absorber volume in the central reflector as well as to the increased decay power of the TRU fuel compositions. For a 0.2%UO(2) mixed or a 30%UO(2) mixed TRU, the peak fuel temperature was decreased due to the reduced decay power, however, it was still higher than 1600 degrees C due to the lack of heat absorber volume in the central reflector.

G.; Atanasova, B.; Groudev, Pavlin			Severe accident management strategy verification for VVER-1000 (V320) reactor	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								Severe accident analysis of a reactor is an important aspect in evaluation of source term. This in turn helps in emergency planning and Severe Accident Management (SAM). The use of the Severe Accident Management Guideline (SAMG) is required for accident situation which is not handled adequately through the use of Emergency Operating Procedures (EOP), thus leading to a partial or a total core melt. Actions recommended in the SAMG aim at limiting the risk of radiologically significant radioactive releases in the short- and mid-term (a few hours to a few days). Initiation of SAMG for VVER-1000 is considered at two core exit temperatures viz. 650 degrees C as a desirable entry temperature and 980 degrees C as a backup action. Analyses have been carried out for VVER-1000 (V320) for verification of some of the strategies namely water injection in primary and secondary circuit. These strategies are analysed for a high and low pressure primary circuit transients. Station Black Out (SBO) is one such high pressure transient for which core heat can be removed by natural circulation of the primary circuit inventory by maintaining the secondary side inventory. This strategy has been verified where the feed water injection to secondary side of SG is considered from external power sources (e.g. mobile DG sets) as suggested in SAM guidelines. The second transient, a low pressure event is analysed for verification of the SG flooding and core flooding strategies. The analysis shows that SG flooding is not adequate to arrest the degradation of the core. In case of core flooding strategy, the analyses show that core flooding is not adequate to arrest the degradation of the core for the large break LOCA where as for small break LOCA the injections through available safety systems are adequate. The assessments are carried out with integral severe accident computer code ASTEC V1.3. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Chatterjee, B.; Mukhopadhyay, D.; Lele, H.

An investigation of these variations has been carried out at the Nuclear Engineering Department of the National Technical University of Athens over a two year period (3/2008-4/2010). In the framework of this study, sampling and analysis methods were appropriately selected to allow for the observation of short-term Be-7 air activity concentration variations, using a 4-hour sampling interval, while taking in consideration type A and type B uncertainties introduced in the measurements. In order to study the role of precipitation in surface air Be-7 activity concentration variations, a procedure for collecting and analyzing rainwater was developed. The techniques used in the present study allowed for the observation of seasonal and diurnal Be-7 concentration variations, as well as correlations between Be-7 activity concentration and the meteorological parameters of air temperature and relative humidity.

The measurements were made by gamma spectrometry with a high purity germanium detector. The average activity concentrations of (238)U and (232)Th determined in the measured samples (3250 Bq/kg, and 556 Bq/kg, respectively) are much higher than the concentrations found in the Earth's crust. The activity concentration of (226)Ra is also high in all analyzed samples, while (40)K was not detected. The gamma index, I, the external hazard index, H(ex), the internal hazard index, H(in), and the radium equivalent activity, Ra(cg), were calculated. Due to relatively high activity concentration level of uranium in imported zircon samples, specific regulations are necessary for zircon compound used in ceramic industry.

STATISTICAL TREATMENT OF NUCLEAR COUNTING RESULTS	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY & RADIATION PROTECTION			English	Article						counting statistics; Chauvenet's criterion; U-test	TIME ENLARGEMENT LAW; BREAKDOWN	Since the exact time a specific nucleus undergoes radioactive decay cannot be specified, nor can showers caused by secondary cosmic rays be predicted, statistical laws play an important role in almost all cases of experimental nuclear physics. This paper describes the method for the statistical treatment of nuclear counting results obtained experimentally by taking into account random variables pertaining to both frequent and infrequent phenomena. When processing counting measurement data, it is recommended to first discard spurious random variables that spoil the statistics by using Chauvenet's criterion, as well as to test if the results in the statistical sample follow a unique statistical distribution by using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (U-test). The verification of the suggested statistical method was performed on counting statistics obtained both from the radioactive source Cs-137 and background radiation, expected to follow the normal distribution and the Poisson distribution, respectively. Results show that the application of the proposed statistical method excludes random fluctuations of the radioactive source or of the background radiation from the total statistical sample, as well as possible inadequacies in the experimental set-up and show an extremely effective agreement of the theoretical distribution of random variables with the corresponding experimentally obtained random variables.

Feynman-Alpha and Rossi-Alpha Formulas with Delayed Neutrons for Subcritical Reactors Driven by Pulsed Non-Poisson Sources with Correlation Between Different Pulses	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							MULTIPLE EMISSION SOURCES; EXPERIMENTAL-VERIFICATION; SYSTEMS; NOISE	Through our earlier papers, we have shown that reactor noise in accelerator-driven systems (ADS) is different from that in critical or radioactive source-driven subcritical systems due to periodically pulsed source and its non-Poisson character. We have developed a theory of reactor noise for ADS, taking into account the non-Poisson character of the source. Various noise descriptors, such as Rossi-alpha, Feynman-alpha (or variance to mean), power spectral density, and cross power spectral density, have been derived for a periodically pulsed source, including correlation between different pulses and finite pulses of different shapes. For mathematical simplicity, the theory was restricted to the case of prompt neutrons only. Recently, we extended the theory to the delayed neutron case and derived Feynman-alpha and Rossi-alpha formulae by considering the source to be a periodically pulsed non-Poisson source, without correlations between different pulses. The present paper extends the treatment to account for the possibility of correlations between pulses. Feynman-alpha and Rossi-alpha formulas are derived by considering the source to be a periodic sequence of delta function non-Poisson pulses, with exponential correlations.	[Rana, Y.

This so-called "steam explosion" is generally believed to involve fine fragmentation of the melt drops induced by steam bubble collapse and concomitant water vaporization on a timescale that is short compared with the steam pressure relief time. Motivated by a previously published idea that rapid solidification would render uranium oxide (UO2)-containing (corium) melt drops stiff and resistant to the fragmentation induced by steam bubble collapse that is requisite for an explosion, here we combine solidification theory with an available theory of the stability of thin, submerged crusts subject to acceleration to predict the "cutoff time" beyond which melt drop fragmentation is suppressed by crust cover rigidity. Illustrative calculations show that the cutoff time for corium melt drops in water is a fraction of a second and probably shorter than the time it takes to form the coarse-premixture configuration of melt drops in water that is a prerequisite for an explosion, while the opposite is true for the molten aluminum oxide (Al2O3) water system for which the window of opportunity for an explosion is predicted to be several seconds. These theoretical findings are consistent with previous experiments that revealed molten UO2 or corium pours into water to be nonexplosive and produced steam explosions upon pouring molten Al2O3 into water.

So far, to avoid thermal alteration of an engineered barrier system such as bentonite, the maximum temperature in the conceptual design of a Japanese geological disposal system has been limited to <373 K. However, for a limited time period, even if the temperature exceeds 373 K or the boiling point at the underground level, the robustness of the system is expected to be sufficient. An upward revision of the permissible maximum temperature would reduce the total space of the repository and would result in more effective use of the space. Therefore, when two-phase flow is also considered, a more reliable estimate of the thermal impact on the repository system is needed. In general, the fluid flow velocities of two phases are described by Darcy's law including the relative permeabilities defined as the functions of liquid-water saturation (or steam saturation), e.g., Corey's equations. However, such saturation (e.g., liquid-water saturation S(w)) is not always uniformly distributed in the grid cells of the numerical implementation. In this study, the uncertainty of k(r) due to the distribution of S(w) was examined by using various kinds of probability density functions (pdf's). The results suggest that the apparent k(r) value can be numerically described by the arithmetic mean, the standard deviation, and the skewness of S(w) (In other words, the apparent value of k(r) does not depend on the types of pdf's.) Since the value of S(w) is in the range of 0 to 1, the standard deviation and the skewness are limited. Therefore, the apparent values of k(r) also are in a limited range. Using the Lagrange multiplier method, this study examined the ranges of the k(r) value for each arithmetic mean of saturation S(wa). Furthermore, by considering both the frequency distribution and the spatial distribution of saturation, this study quantitatively shows the degree of uncertainty of relative-permeability curves. These curves can explain the scattered data of two-phase-flow experiments.

This review has been provided to Safegrounds as a summary of the basis for current radiation risk estimates and the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) protection system, in a form that will be accessible to a wide range of stakeholders. Safegrounds has also received viewpoint papers from other members who contend that the ICRP methodology results in substantial underestimates of risk, particularly for internal emitters. There is an extensive literature on the risks of radiation exposure, regularly reviewed by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) and other expert groups. These data provide a sound basis for the system of protection recommended by ICRP. The available epidemiological and experimental evidence supports the application of cancer risk estimates derived for acute, high dose, external exposures to low dose exposures to external and internal sources. In the context of radioactively contaminated land on nuclear and defence sites, the national standards for the cleaning up of land and for waste disposal correspond to very low doses, two orders of magnitude less than average annual doses in the UK from natural background radiation (10-20 mu Sv compared with 2-3 mSv). Risks at such very low doses can only be estimated on the basis of observations after exposure of population groups at much higher doses. The estimated risks at these very low doses, while uncertain, are as likely to be overestimates as underestimates.	[Mobbs, S. F.; Muirhead, C. R.; Harrison, J.

J	Chandler, S				Chandler, Steve			Radioactive waste policy and legislation: 50 years on from the 1960 Act	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Review								Over the past 50 years a comprehensive regulatory framework for radioactive substances in the UK has been progressively introduced, important initial milestones being the white paper Cmnd 884 and the Radioactive Substances Act 1960. During the 1970s and 1980s there were a succession of enquiries and white papers which developed from the growing awareness of the problems of the nuclear waste legacy. This was followed by a comprehensive policy white paper in 1995: Cm 2919. In 1990, 1993, 1995 and 2005 some aspects of the 1960 Act were updated. The most recent, and most radical, modernisation took place in 2010, when the Act was incorporated into the Environmental Permitting Regulations, in England and Wales. Currently a major review of the exemption orders and exclusion criteria under the radioactive substances legislation is close to completion, which will complete the current phase of modernisation of the regulatory framework.

Doses to the red bone marrow of young people and adults from radiation of natural origin	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article							INTERNAL EMITTERS; RISKS	Natural radiation sources comprise cosmic rays, terrestrial gamma rays, radionuclides in food and inhaled isotopes of radon with their decay products. These deliver doses to all organs and tissues including red bone marrow (RBM), the tissue in which leukaemia is thought to originate. In this paper we calculate the age-dependent annual RBM doses from natural radiation sources to young people and to adults at average levels of exposure in the UK. The contributions to dose are generally less complex than in the case of doses to foetuses and young children where it is necessary to take into account transfer of radionuclides across the placenta, intakes in mother's milk and changes in gut uptake in young infants. However, there is high uptake of alkaline earths and of similar elements in the developing skeleton and this significantly affects the doses from radioisotopes of these elements, not just in the teens and twenties but through into the fifth decade of life. The total equivalent dose to the RBM from all natural sources of radiation at age 15 years is calculated to be about 1200 mu Sv a year at average UK levels, falling to rather less than 1100 mu Sv per year in later life; the gentle fall from the late teens onwards reflects the diminishing effect of the high uptakes of radioisotopes of the alkaline earths and of lead in this period. About 60% of the equivalent dose is contributed by the low linear energy transfer (LET) component. Radionuclides in food make the largest contribution to equivalent doses to RBM and much the largest contribution to the absorbed dose from high LET radiation (mainly alpha particles).	[Kendall, G.

Investigation of the environmental impacts of naturally occurring radionuclides in the processing of sulfide ores for gold using gamma spectrometry	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article							RADIOACTIVITY; RADIATION; AREA; PRODUCTS; INDUSTRY; EGYPT; ROCKS; SOILS	The possible environmental impacts of naturally occurring radionuclides on workers and a critical community, as a result of milling and processing sulfide ores for gold by a mining company at Bogoso in the western region of Ghana, have been investigated using gamma spectroscopy. Indicative doses for the workers during sulfide ore processing were calculated from the activity concentrations measured at both physical and chemical processing stages. The dose rate, annual effective dose equivalent, radium equivalent activity, external and internal hazard indices, and radioactivity level index for tailings, for the de-silted sediments of run-off from the vicinity of the tailings dam through the critical community, and for the soils of the critical community's basic schools were calculated and found to be lower than their respective permissible limits. The environmental impact of the radionuclides is therefore expected to be low in this mining environment.	[Gbadago, J. K.; Darko, E. O.] Ghana Atom Energy Commiss, Legon, Accra, Ghana; [Gbadago, J.

One was commercially produced with Am-241 activity artificially added to the bone inserts. The other, the United States Transuranium and Uranium Registries' (USTUR) leg phantom, was manufactured from Am-241-contaminated bones resulting from an intake. The comparison of the two types of leg phantoms showed that the two phantoms are not similar in their activity distributions. An error in a bone activity estimate could be quite large if the commercial leg phantom is used to estimate what is contained in the USTUR leg phantom and, consequently, a real person. As the latter phantom was created as a result of a real contamination, it is deemed to be the more representative of what would actually happen if a person were internally contaminated with Am-241.

HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						risk analysis; tritium; water; drinking; uncertainty analysis	ATOMIC-BOMB SURVIVORS; RADIOGENIC CANCERS; DOSE COEFFICIENTS; PROBABILITY	This paper presents an assessment of lifetime risks of cancer incidence associated with the drinking water standard for tritium established by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA); this standard is an annual-average maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 740 Bq L-1. This risk assessment has several defining characteristics: (1) an accounting of uncertainty in all parameters that relate a given concentration of tritium in drinking water to lifetime risk (except the number of days of consumption of drinking water in a year and the number of years of consumption) and an accounting of correlations of uncertain parameters to obtain probability distributions that represent uncertainty in estimated lifetime risks of cancer incidence; (2) inclusion of a radiation effectiveness factor (REF) to represent an increased biological effectiveness of low-energy electrons emitted in decay of tritium compared with high-energy photons; (3) use of recent estimates of risks of cancer incidence from exposure to high-energy photons, including the dependence of risks on an individual's gender and age, in the BEIR VII report; and (4) inclusion of risks of incidence of skin cancer, principally basal cell carcinoma. By assuming ingestion of tritium in drinking water at the MCL over an average life expectancy of 80 y in females and 75 y in males, 95% credibility intervals of lifetime risks of cancer incidence obtained in this assessment are (0.35, 12) x 10(-4) in females and (0.30, 15) x 10(-4) in males. Mean risks, which are considered to provide the best single measure of expected risks, are about 3 x 10(-4) in both genders. In comparison, USEPA's point estimate of the lifetime risk of cancer incidence, assuming a daily consumption of drinking water of 2 L over an average life expectancy of 75.2 y and excluding an REF for tritium and incidence of skin cancer, is 5.6 x 10(-5). Probability distributions of annual equivalent doses to the whole body associated with the drinking water standard for tritium also were obtained. Means and 97.5(th) percentiles of maximum annual doses to females and males, which occur at age < 1 y, all are less than the annual equivalent dose of 40 mu Sv used by USEPA to establish the MCL.

ASSESSMENT OF (SR)-S-90 AND (CS)-C-137 PENETRATION INTO REINFORCED CONCRETE (EXTENT OF "DEEPENING") UNDER NATURAL ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						Cs-137; Sr-90, Chernobyl; contamination, environmental		When assessing the feasibility of remediation following the detonation of a radiological dispersion device or improvised nuclear device in a large city, several issues should be considered, including the levels and characteristics of the radioactive contamination, the availability of resources required for decontamination and the planned future use of the city's structures and buildings. Currently, little is known about radionuclide penetration into construction materials in an urban environment. Knowledge in this area would be useful when considering costs of a thorough decontamination of buildings, artificial structures and roads in an affected urban environment. Pripyat, a city substantially contaminated by the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident in April 1986, may provide some answers. The main objective of this study was to assess the depth of Sr-90 and Cs-137 penetration into reinforced concrete structures in a highly contaminated urban environment under natural weather conditions. Thirteen reinforced concrete core samples were obtained from external surfaces of a contaminated building in Pripyat. The concrete cores were drilled to obtain sample layers of 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, 20-30, 30-40 and 40-50 mm. Both Sr-90 and Cs-137 were detected in the entire 0-50 mm profile of the reinforced cores sampled. In most of the cores, over 90% of the total Cs-137 inventory and 70% of the total Sr-90 inventory was found in the first 0-5 mm layer of the reinforced concrete. Strontium-90 (Sr-90) had penetrated markedly deeper into the reinforced concrete structures than Cs-137.

By using high resolution gamma-ray spectrometry, cross-section data for the production of (56,54,52)Mn and (51)Cr were determined. Comparison with the earlier published data and with the results predicted by the ALICE-IPPE and EMPIRE-II theoretical codes - improved for more reliable calculations for d-induced reactions - and with data in the TENDL 2010 libraries are also included. Thick target yields were calculated from a fit to our experimental excitation curves and implications for practical applications in industrial (Thin Layer Activation) accelerator technology are discussed.

Activation detectors of aluminum, bismuth, gold, and gold covered with cadmium were inserted at various depths in the concrete pile. In addition, the distributions of activation reaction rate were simulated by FLUKA and PHITS Monte-Carlo codes. Generally, comparison of measured and calculated reaction rates show agreement within a factor of two. The experimental data will be useful for benchmarking Monte-Carlo radiation transport simulation code capabilities in estimating radioactivity induced in accelerator radiation shielding.

Design studies of a typical PWR core using advanced computational tools and techniques	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						PWR core; WIMSD-5B; TWOTRAN II; CITATION; MCNP4C2; Neutronic analysis		This study deals with the design and development of calculational techniques and evaluation of key neutronic parameters of a typical PWR core having a total reactor power of 2652 MW(t) (890 MW(e)). The PWR core consists of 157 fuel assemblies containing a total of similar to 72 tons of uranium arranged vertically in a concentric square array within the core shroud. Each fuel assembly contains 264 UO(2) fuel pins with various enrichments (2.1, 2.6 and 3.1%), 24 control rods of Gd(2)O(3) and one central water channel and all are arranged in a 17 x 17 array of matrix. Different computer codes including WIMS, TWOTRAN, CITATION and MCNP have been employed to develop a versatile and accurate reactor physics model of the PWR core. The computational methods, tools and techniques, customization of cross section libraries, various models for cells and super cells, and a lot of associated utilities have been standardized and established/validated for the overall core analysis. The analyses were performed in 3 steps: firstly for fuel pincells, then for the fuel assemblies and finally for the whole core. The WIMS and MCNP calculated infinite multiplication factors for fuel pincells having 2.1% enriched (235)U were found to be 1.23393 and 1.23654, for 2.6% enrichment 1.28635 and 1.28887, and finally for 3.1% enrichment 1.32481 and 1.32812, respectively. For fuel assembly, WIMS and MCNP calculated infinite multiplication factors having 2.1% enrichment were found to be 1.24853 and 1.25445, for 2.6% enrichment 1.30372 and 1.30992, and for 3.1% enrichment 1.34424 and 1.35041, respectively. The effective multiplication factor calculated by CITATION, TWOTRAN and MCNP for whole core were found to be 1.25580, 1.25909 and 1.26382, respectively. The peak thermal neutron flux in the core calculated by MCNP was found to be 5.0298 x 10(14) neutrons/cm(2) s and the average core power density was 17.1 kW/cm(3). The calculated results from different codes were found to be very good agreement for different moderator conditions. The choice of computer codes like WIMSD, TWOTRAN, CITATION and MCNP which are being used in nuclear industry for many years were selected to identify and develop new capabilities needed to support PWR analysis. The ultimate goal of the validation of the computer codes for PWR applications is to acquire and reinforce the capability of these general purpose computer codes to perform the core design and optimization study.

Reference eigenvalues and selected pin and bundle fission rates are also included. This benchmark is intended to provide computational reactor physicists and methods developers with a stylized model problem in more than two energy groups that is realistic with respect to the underlying physics. In addition to transport theory code verification, the 8-group energy structure provides reactor physicist with an ideal problem for examining cross section homogenization and collapsing effects in a full-core environment. To this end, additional 2-, 4- and 47-group full-core Monte Carlo benchmark solutions are compared to analyze homogenization-free transport approximations incurred as a result of energy group condensation.

Sixteen marine sediment cores from selected locations within the EEZ were collected for determination of NORM activity concentrations using high-purity germanium (HPGe) gamma spectrometer. From the measurement, the activity concentration of (226)Ra, (228)Ra and (40)K is ranged from 16 +/- A 4 Bq/kg to 46 +/- A 6 Bq/kg (total mean 30), 28 +/- A 7 Bq/kg to 87 +/- A 11 Bq/kg (total mean 56) and 171 +/- A 33 Bq/kg to 690 +/- A 89 Bq/kg (total mean 420), dry wt., respectively. The activity concentrations of radionuclides in most of the core were quite uniform suggesting that there were thorough vertical mixed of sediment throughout the core. The results obtained were also in good agreement with those previous reported from other countries in the region and therefore can be used to enhance present radioactivity database. The calculated external hazard values were ranged from 0.25 to 0.51 with the mean of 0.38 (less than unity) showed little risk of external hazard to the workers handling the sediments and it was likely low level of the mainland natural gamma-radiation in the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia.

Further, the stability constant of the 1 center dot Cs(+) complex in nitrobenzene saturated with water was calculated for a temperature of 25 A degrees C: log beta(nb) (1 center dot Cs(+)) = 6.3 +/- A 0.1. Finally, by using quantum mechanical DFT calculations, the most probable structure of the resulting cationic complex species 1 center dot Cs(+) was solved.

Investigations were carried out at t = 25 A degrees C in NaCl medium at different ionic strengths and in absence of supporting electrolyte for uranyl-fulvate (UO(2)(2+)-FA) and uranyl-polyacrylate (UO(2)(2+)-PAA, PAA MW 2 kDa) systems, respectively. The experimental data are consistent with the following speciation models for the two systems investigated: (i) UO(2)(FA(1)), UO(2)(FA(1))(FA(2)), UO(2)(FA(1))(FA(2))(H) for UO(2)(2+)-fulvate (where FA(1) and FA(2) represent the carboxylic and phenolic fractions, respectively, both present in the structure of FA), and (ii) UO(2)(PAA), UO(2)(PAA)(OH), (UO(2))(2)(PAA)(OH)(2) for UO(2)(2+)-polyacrylate. By using the stability data obtained for all the complex species formed, the uranium(VI) sequestration by PAA and FA was expressed by the pL(50) parameter [i.e. the -log(total ligand concentration) necessary to bind 50% of uranyl ion] at different pH values.

Natural radioactivity levels of limestone rocks in northern Iraq using gamma spectroscopy and nuclear track detector	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Gamma spectroscopy; Natural radioactivity; Nuclear track detector; Limestone rocks	RADON EXHALATION RATE; SEDIMENTARY-ROCKS; SAMPLES; EGYPT; SOIL	The activity concentration of radionuclides, such as U-238, Ra-226 and K-40 of limestone rocks in northern Iraq was measured using gamma spectroscopy. The radionuclide activities were obtained and discussed. CR-39 nuclear track detector was used to measure the radon exhalation rates as well as the effective radium contents of these samples and are found to correspond with uranium concentration values measured by NaI(Tl) detector in the corresponding limestone rocks samples. The absorbed gamma dose rates in air due to the presence of U-238, Ra-226, K-40 and cosmic ray contribution varied between 105.3 and 223.11 nGy/h. The annual effective dose of each sample has been calculated. The correlation between activities of Ra-226, Rn-222 exhalation rates and U-238 is explained. Results show a symmetrical distribution of activity concentrations of primordial of radionuclides in selected samples. The values of all studied radionuclides are considered to be a typical level of natural background and compared with results of similar investigations carried out else where.

The sorption behaviour of uranyl cation on PA-MR was investigated using batch equilibrium technique. The effects of parameters such as shaking speed, pH levels, contact time, metal concentrations, ionic strength and temperature were reported. The results show that the sorption capacity increases with increasing both initial uranyl ion concentration and temperature and decreases with increasing ionic strength. Therefore, the optimum condition for the present study should be using 6.6 mg adsorbent per 1.0 mg uranyl in solution with pH 3.6 and shaking at 250 rpm for 180 min. The adsorption behavior of the system was also investigated and found to be in line with Langmuir isotherm. The kinetic data was well described by the pseudo second-order. Thermodynamics data leads to endothermic process a dagger H = + 31.03 kJ(-1) mol(-1), a dagger S = + 146.64 J mol(-1) K-1 and a dagger G = -11.96 kJ mol(-1) at 20 K. a dagger G decreased to negatives values with increasing temperature indicating that the process was more favoured at high temperature.

The attapulgite sample was characterized by FTIR and XRD. Sorption of U(VI) on attapulgite was strongly dependent on pH and ionic strength. The sorption of U(VI) on attapulgite increased quickly with rising pH at pH < 6, and decreased with increasing pH at pH > 7. The presence of humic acid (HA) enhanced the sorption of U(VI) on attapulgite obviously at low pH because of the strong complexation of surface adsorbed HA with U(VI) on attapulgite surface. Sorption of U(VI) on attapulgite was mainly dominated by ion exchange and/or outer-sphere surface complexation at low pH values, whereas the sorption was attributed to the inner-sphere surface complexation or precipitation at high pH values. The sorption increased with increasing temperature and the thermodynamic parameters calculated from the temperature dependent sorption isotherms suggested that the sorption of U(VI) on attapulgite was a spontaneous and endothermic process. The results indicate that attapulgite is a very suitable material for the preconcentration of U(VI) ions from large volumes of aqueous solutions.

Uranium in natural waters sampled within former uranium mining sites in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Uranium-238; Uranium contamination; Kazakhstan; Kyrgyzstan	MINERAL WATERS; MAILUU-SUU	New data are presented on (238)U concentrations in surface and ground waters sampled at selected uranium mining sites in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan and in water supplies of settlements located in the vicinity of these sites. Radiochemical neutron activation analysis (RNAA) was used for (238)U determination in all cases. In addition, for data accuracy assessments purposes, a sub-set of these samples was analysed by high-resolution alpha spectrometry, following standard radiochemical separation and purification. Our data show that drinking waters sampled at various settlements located close to the uranium mining sites are characterised by relatively low uranium concentrations (1.9-35.9 mu g L(-1)) compared to surface waters sampled within the same sites. The latter show high concentrations of total uranium, reflecting the influence from the radioactive waste generated as a result of uranium ore production.	[Uralbekov, B.

J	Fermvik, A				Fermvik, Anna			Comparison of the effect of alpha and gamma radiolysis on the extraction of americium by C5-BTBP in cyclohexanone	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Radiolysis; Alpha; Gamma; Solvent extraction; Partitioning; BTBP	HEAVY-ION RADIOLYSIS; LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; RADIATION-CHEMISTRY; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; DEGRADATION; SOLVENT; IRRADIATION; BEHAVIOR; LANTHANIDES(III); ACTINIDES(III)	Solvent extraction is a separation technique suitable for the treatment of used nuclear fuel. Two immiscible phases are contacted and the metals of interest are extracted from one phase into the other, most often using so called extractants. One group of extractants is the bis(triazine)-bipyridine (BTBP) type molecules. These molecules have been developed within EU research programs for the separation of actinides from lanthanides. During such an extraction process, the components of the two phases will be exposed to ionizing radiation, since the used fuel contains many highly radioactive species. Radiolytic reactions can alter the chemistry of the extracting system, and affect the metal extraction by degradation of the extractant and the formation of degradation products. In this paper the effect of irradiation with alpha particles and gamma rays, respectively, has been studied for one of the BTBP type molecules, C5-BTBP.

A total of > 400 samples were collected to determine the activity concentration of anthropogenic radionuclides (Pu239+240, Cs-137) and their activity ratio (Pu239+240/Cs-137) in sediments, seawater and biota. The purpose of this study was to determine the concentration levels for these radionuclides and to evaluate any occurrence of radioactive contamination. Sediment cores were obtained using multicorer device, while water samples via co-precipitation techniques and biota was purchased from local fishermen. The activity concentrations of Pu239+240 in sediment, seawater and biota were ranged 0.21-0.45 Bq/kg dry wt., 2.33-7.95 mBq/m(3) and < 0.008 Bq/kg fresh wt., respectively. Meanwhile, the values of Cs-137 were ranged < 1.00-2.71 Bq/kg dry wt. in sediment, 3.40-5.89 Bq/m(3) in seawater and < 0.05-0.41 Bq/kg fresh wt. in biota, respectively. Activity ratios of Pu239+240 to Cs-137 obtained seem to confirm that these artificial radioactivities were mainly due to global nuclear fallout.

Extraction studies of uranium into a third-phase of thorium nitrate employing tributyl phosphate and N,N-dihexyl octanamide as extractants in different diluents	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Uranium; Thorium; Third-phase; Extraction; Dialkyl amide; TBP	3RD PHASE-FORMATION; N,N-DIALKYL ALIPHATIC AMIDES; STICKY SPHERES MODEL; FISSION-PRODUCTS; N-DODECANE; DI(2-ETHYLHEXYL)ISOBUTYRAMIDE D2EHIBA; SUBSTITUTED AMIDES; SOLVENT-EXTRACTION; BUTYL PHOSPHATE; SYSTEM	Extraction behavior of 1 x 10(-2)-0.1 M U(VI) from aqueous phases containing 0.86 M Th(IV) at 4 M HNO(3) in 1.1 M tributyl phosphate (TBP) and 1.1 M N,N-dihexyl octanamide (DHOA) solutions in different diluents viz. n-dodecane, 10% 1-octanol + n-dodecane, and decahydronaphthalene (decalin) was studied. Third-phase formation was observed in both the extractants using n-dodecane as diluent. There was a gradual decrease in Th(IV) concentration in the third-phase (heavy organic phase, HOP) with increased aqueous U(VI) concentration [0.71 M (no U(VI))-0.61 M (0.1 M U(VI)) for TBP; 0.27 M (no U(VI))-0.22 M (0.1 M U(VI)) for DHOA]. The HOP volume in case of DHOA was similar to 2.2 times of that of TBP. Uranium concentration in HOP increased with its initial concentration in the aqueous phase [from 1.8 x 10(-2) M (0.01 M U(VI))-0.162 M (0.1 M U(VI)) for TBP; from 1.4 x 10(-2) M (0.01 M U(VI))-0.14 M (0.1 M U(VI)) for DHOA] suggesting that Th(IV) was being replaced by U(VI). An empirical correlation was developed for predicting the concentrations of uranium and thorium in HOP for both the extractants. No third-phase appeared during the extraction of uranium and thorium from the aqueous phases employing 10% 1-octanol + n-dodecane, or decalin as diluents, and therefore, were better choices as diluent for alleviating the third-phase formation during the reprocessing of spent thorium based fuels, and for the recovery of thorium from high-level waste solutions.

Extending the work, similar studies were performed on intact unirradiated PHWR UO2 fuel pellets (similar to 15 g U) with varying compositions of organic solvate of tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP). It was observed that extent of dissolution was a strong function of organic solution composition TBP center dot(HNO3) (x) (H2O) (y) . Complete dissolution of intact UO2 pellet in a reasonable time was observed only in case of a particular solvate composition.	[Kumar, Bijendra; Sampath, M.; Kumar, Shekhar; Sivakumar, D.; Mudali, U.
