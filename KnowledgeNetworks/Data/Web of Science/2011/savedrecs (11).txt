One disadvantage of the above reciprocating pump is rather high ultimate pressure and drastically decreasing of the pumping performance at the lower suction pressure. The main reason would be that the check valves could not open enough at lower suction pressure, which are installed in the piston of the pump. In order to improve this disadvantage, solenoid valves option was tested instead of the check valves. Intentional opening & closing of the solenoid valves, linked with reciprocating motion cycle of the pump, improved more than one order of the ultimate pressure drastically. High evacuation performance was also demonstrated by the combination of molecular DRUG pump and the improved reciprocating pump with solenoid valve.

In the case that a deuterium-rich pellet is employed, the amount of tritium to be injected to the reactor as the fuel can be reduced compared with the case when the D to T ratio is the same. The fusion output power can be adjusted by controlling the D/T ratio while the electron density is fixed This control method of the output power by D/T ratio scan can save the tritium consumption compared with that by the density scan, especially in the cases with lower fusion output power.

The results showed that the initial tritium supply for startup was strongly dependent on the tritium burn-up fraction in plasma and mean residence time of tritium in the plasma exhaust processing system. Considering the sensitive analysis and other advanced designs, the tritium burn-up fraction in plasma was selected to be 0.1 for FDS-II. The minimum initial tritium supply for startup was similar to 4.2kg. Considering the potential malfunction in the fuel cycle system and assuming the reactor ran continuously before solving the malfunction, it was reasonable to keep the initial tritium supply for FDS-II as similar to 8.9kg.

Tritium concentration profile in a steady state was measured with an imaging plate (IP) technique. According to a simple electromigration theory, the effective charge Z* of tritium was determined from the tritium profiles. Z* obtained increases from 0.7 to 0.95 with increasing temperature. Comparison with the value of Z* for pure V is made and influences of alloying elements on tritium electromigration are discussed.

STUDY OF TRITIUM AND HELIUM RELEASE FROM IRRADIATED LITHIUM CERAMICS Li2TiO3	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								Lithium-based oxide ceramics are considered as the candidate materials for solid breeders of future fusion reactors' blankets. Breeder's goal is effective, safe and reliable production of tritium as a result of lithium-neutron reactions. Main candidates as a breeder material are Li2O, Li4SiO4, Li2TiO3 and Li2ZrO3, which are able to keep their physical-chemical properties despite of lithium burn-up. Lithium metatitanate Li2TiO3 attracts the great attention due to its chemical stability and high speed of tritium release under low temperatures (from 200 to 400 degrees C). This paper contains the results of the studies on tritium and helium release from the samples of irradiated lithium ceramics Li2TiO3.

Stages of gradual and burst release are evident in the tritium release of the PBA Be pebbles at a temperature ramp of 2.3-4.8 K/min from room temperature to 1310-1520 K. These two stages may be related to the tritium release by atomic diffusion and bubble venting respectively. The main maximum of the tritium release rate of the PBA Be pebbles was found to be in the temperature ranges of 1178-1309 K and 1178-1350 K at the temperature ramps of 2.4 and 4.8 K/min respectively. The tritium inventory and abundance ratios of chemical forms of tritium localized in the pebbles were determined with dissolution methods. The total tritium inventory in the PBA Be pebbles was found to be 2-4 GBq/g.

In this paper, the effect of grain size on bulk diffusion of hydrogen isotope in ternary lithium oxide was studied. LiNbO3 single-crystal samples of different grain sizes were used: cubic samples (a) 4.7 x 4.7 x4.7 mm(3), (b) 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 mm(3), and (c) 0.46 x 0.46 x 0.46 mm(3); powder sample (d) 45 mu m (a.v). With the grain size of cubic samples decreasing, it was clearly observed that the position of TDS peak related to bulk diffusion moved to a lower temperature because of shorter diffusion path. In comparison with computational simulation based on a diffusion model, a fair agreement between experiment and calculation was obtained.

EFFECT OF WATER FORMATION REACTION ON TRITIUM RELEASE BEHAVIOR FROM Li4SiO4	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							SOLID BREEDER MATERIALS; BLANKET	It is observed that a Air amount of physical and chemical adsorbed water is released from solid breeder materials by introduction of dry N-2 gas and that not a little amount of water is also continuously produced by the water formation reaction when the purge gas with hydrogen is applied. It is reported by present authors that the water released to the purge gas from solid breeder materials affects the tritium release behavior. The capacity and desorption rate of chemical adsorbed water, and the capacity and rate of water formation reaction for Li4SiO4, which has been supplied from FzK, are quantified in this study. It is found that the overall reaction rate of water formation on Li4SiO4 is larger than the rate observed for other solid breeder materials. Therefore, most hydrogen added to the blanket purge gas changes to water so far as the water formation capacity of Li4SiO4 remains. It is also found that water formation capacity of Li4SiO4 is almost the same as that of Li2TiO3. Tritium release behavior from Li4SiO4 and Li2TiO3 packed in the blanket are compared in this paper using the Kyushu University model and properties obtained in this study.

We also investigated the behavior of the isotope exchange by substituting a protium atom with deuterium or tritium. The oxygen atom of H2O adsorbs on the Al atom of the outermost surface layer, the entire water molecule is slanted at the direction of a hollow site, and a molecular plane is nearly parallel to the surface. The adsorbed states are mostly due to coupling of lone-pair electrons of H2O with the empty p orbitals of the Al atom of surface. The behavior of dissociation for H2O is clarified from molecular dynamics simulations, indicating that the second neighbor oxygen atom is more preferable adsorption site for dissociation than the nearest neighbor oxygen atom on the surface.

TRITIUM EXTRACTION FROM LIQUID Pb-16Li: A CRITICAL REVIEW OF CANDIDATE TECHNOLOGIES FOR ITER AND DEMO APPLICATIONS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								Extraction of tritium from liquid lead lithium eutectic alloy is a key topic for the feasibility of any PbLi based tritium breeding blanket (BB). Particularly in DEMO, high tritium extraction efficiency will be required in order to keep low the tritium concentration in the Pb-16Li loop. This is essential to minimize tritium release into the environment and tritium permeation from BB into the primary cooling system. In addition, the tritium extraction process needs to be highly reliable in order not to impact negatively on the operation of the whole fusion reactor, ITER or DEMO. In the present paper, a critical review of the main candidate technologies for tritium extraction from Pb-16Li, particularly gas liquid contactors and vacuum permeators, is accomplished. The intrinsic limits and possible advantages of these technologies are presented and discussed, in the light of considerations coming directly from mathematical models describing their behaviour as well as from the experimental results so far achieved.

It was found that H and D permeate independently regardless of the H/D composition ratio in the upstream gas. Dissolution of H and D atoms into Li(17)Pb(83) follows the Sieverts' law in the two-component system in a similar way to the single one. Diffusion of H and D in Li(17)Pb(83) was the rate-determining step in the overall permeation process. An isotope effect of permeability between H and D was around 1.4 in the temperature range from 400 degrees C to 700 degrees C. The ratio of the isotope effect was in proportion to the square root of mass ratio of D to H. Tritium permeation can be estimated in a similar way.

STUDY ON TRITIUM RELEASE BEHAVIOR FROM Li2ZrO3	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							SOLID BREEDER MATERIALS; PURGE GAS; WATER	The present authors have developed the tritium release model to represent the tritium release behavior from solid breeder materials (Li2ZrO3, Li2TiO3, Li4SiO4, LiAlO2 and Li2O). It has been found that water is released from solid breeder materials into the purge gas due to desorption of physically and chemically adsorbed water and water generation reaction and that this water affects the tritium release behavior. In this study, the amount of adsorbed water and its desorption rate for Li2ZrO3 were quantified. It was found in this experiment that Li2ZrO3 has the largest adsorption amount among the solid breeder candidates. It was also observed that Li2ZrO3 has the largest water generation capacity among the solid breeder candidates. A unique reaction at around 550 degrees C which made up approximately 80% of the capacity of water generation was also observed. It is considered that the phase change of ZrO2 at around 550 degrees C supplies oxygen to promote water generation reaction. Tritium release behavior from Li2ZrO3 blanket was estimated using the properties obtained in this study under the operational condition of ITER or a commercial reactor.

We are focusing on the biological effects of tritiated water (HTO) given at low dose and/or with low dose rate. Hypersensitive assay systems for radiation biological experiments using cultured mammalian cells or transgenic mice have been established and their availability for assessment of biological effects of HTO were tested. A hypersensitive detection system for mutagenesis at Hprt locus was established by using hamster cells carrying a human X-chromosome. The cells present more than 50-fold sensitivity for Hprt-deficient mutation, and this allowed us to detect a significant elevation of mutation frequency by radiations at the dose of less than 0.2 Gy. Because the reverse dose rate effect has been reported for mutation induction by high LET radiation such as neutrons, we first tested whether the reverse dose rate effects could be seen for HTO (tritium beta-rays) or not. No significant change in mutation frequency by HTO was observed in the range of dose rates between 0.05 cGy/h and 2.0 cGy/h, whereas clear reverse dose rate effects was observed in the case of fission neutrons or carbon beam. The result suggests that the reverse dose rate effect does not apply in the case of mutation induction by HTO. In addition, mutation spectrum in the mutants induced by HTO was similar to those in spontaneously induced mutants, suggesting that exposure to a certain level of HTO could enhance the spontaneous mutagenesis.

EXCHANGE VELOCITY APPROACH AND THE ROLE OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS FOR TRITIUM TRANSFER FROM ATMOSPHERE TO PLANTS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; MODEL; LEAF; CANOPY; LEAVES	The continuous efforts dedicated to increase the predictive power of risk assessment for the large tritium releases imply models based on process level analysis. Tritium transfer from atmosphere to plants and the subsequent conversion into organically bound tritium strongly depend on the plant characteristics, seasons, and meteorological conditions, which have a large variability. This paper presents an inter-comparison of different models for canopy resistance and photosynthesis based on knowledge from plant physiology, agro meteorology, crop science, and atmospheric physics. The authors use Jacobs-Calvet-Ronda approach to model the canopy resistance combined with photosynthesis model and the data base taken from WOFOST crop growth model. The same photosynthesis model is used to assess the organically bound tritium production during the daytime and night time.

MUTATIONS INDUCED BY TRITIATED WATER IN MOUSE SPLEEN	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							IN-VIVO; MICE	We first examined two lines of transgenic mouse, gpt delta and Muta, for sensitivity of radiation-induced mutations in spleen. The gpt delta mouse could detect mutations induced by 2 to 8 Gy of gamma-rays with 2-times higher sensitivity than Muta mouse. The reason seemed to be that radiation induces predominantly deletion type mutation which is rather rare in natural background and gpt delta mouse can detect exclusively this deletion type mutation, whereas Muta mouse detects all types of mutation including the deletion. Next, we applied the gpt delta mouse to study mutation induction by tritiated water. A half ml of saline containing 0, 266 or 532 MBq of tritiated water was administered to the mice intraperitoneally and mutations in spleen were examined 7 days later. The estimated absorbed doses were 0, 3 and 6 Gy, respectively. With 3 Gy, the mutant frequency was elevated approximately 2-fold above control level, and it remained at a similar level with 6 Gy. These indicate that gpt delta mouse could be a good model animal to study genotoxicity of tritium.

POSSIBLE ROLE OF WRN PROTEIN IN CELLULAR RESPONSE INDUCED BY A LITTLE DNA DAMAGE	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							WERNER-SYNDROME PROTEIN; POLYMERASE ETA; ENDS	Werner syndrome (WS) is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with premature aging and cancer predisposition caused by mutations at the WRN gene. Several recent reports suggest that accumulation of DNA damage could lead to premature cellular aging. Therefore, WRN might function in DNA damage response, particularly DNA repair. Here, we investigated the role of WRN in DNA repair and genome integrity. WRN protein rapidly accumulated at DNA damage sites and formed discrete nuclear foci only during S phase, but not in G1 phase. WRN-defective WS cells showed the spontaneous accumulation of gamma-H2AX (DSB marker), suggesting that WRN could function to repair the S phase-dependent DNA damage. However, WS cells showed homologous recombination (HR) at normal level, although HR repair functions preferentially during the S phase. Translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) is known as another repair pathway for S phase-dependent DNA damage. WS cells exhibit an increase in spontaneous focus formation of pol eta and Rad18, which are important for TLS regulation. WS cells also showed the spontaneous ubiquitination of PCNA and increased pol eta-related gene mutation. Taken together, WRN could work for the regulation of TLS pathway and might also be important to maintain genome integrity under a little DNA damage by tritium.

Tritium exists as tritiated water (HTO) which is produced by an isotope exchange reaction from HT in normal circumstance. In this study we analyzed cellular response against HTO exposure in a human liver cancer cell line HepG2 and a cervical cancer cell line HeLa. These cells were immersed in RPMI medium containing HTO at the dose rate of 0.5 Gy/hr for 20 hrs (10 Gy). We determined whether the DNA-PK/AKT pathway is activated by chronic HTO exposure or not. As well as X-rays, exposure of HepG2 and HeLa cells to HTO activated AKT, which was shown by phosphorylated-AKT at Serine473. The activation of DNA-PK was also observed in these cells by X-ray irradiation but not by exposure to HTO. Instead of DNA-PK, epidermal growth factor receptor and ERK1/2 were activated following HTO exposure. These results suggested that certain cellular molecules are response to HTO exposure. Our study may provide molecular markers to estimate the biological effects in response to tritium exposure in human cells.

As a result, during the routine operation or in case of accidents, one of the major issues is the assessment of the biological effects of tritium released from nuclear fusion power plants. In this study, the mutagenic effects of tritiated water (HTO) were compared to those of (137)Cs gamma irradiation on spleen T lymphocytes of wild (p53(+/+)) mice and p53-deficient (p53(-/-)) mice. In both mice, TCR variant fractions induced by HTO was higher than those by simulation-irradiation of (137)Cs gamma rays. When compared on the basis of the induced TCR variant fractions in p53(-/-) mice at 3 Gy, tritium beta rays appear to be 1.7 times more mutagenic than gamma rays. On the other hand, in p53(+/+) mice, HTO injection increased induced TCR variant fractions significantly, whereas simulation-irradiation did not increase those at all. In order to elucidate the reason responsible for this difference in p53(+/+) mice, we investigated the apoptotic ability of spleen T lymphocytes. As a result, the apoptotic ability of spleen T lymphocytes from p53(+/+) mice exposed to HTO was reduced significantly compared to that from p53(+/+) mice not exposed.

Tritium acts much like hydrogen and is easily disbursed in environmental and biological systems. The risk assessment of tritium is one of the major issues arising in the development of the fusion reactors. Exposure to tritium increases the risk of developing cancer as with all ionizing radiation. Cancer risk of tritium in man must be estimated based on experimental studies alone due to lack of human epidemiological data. Although the effects of tritium in mice have been described in many reports, the available information is not sufficient to accurately estimate risk from tritium exposure. To evaluate cancer risk from tritium exposure, we developed Rev1 transgenic mice as a high radiation sensitive assay system. Rev1 has a central role in translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), which is known as error-prone DNA repair. It has been reported that absence of Rev1 sensitizes to a variety of DNA damaging agents including ionizing radiation. Overexpression of Rev1 enhanced chemical-induced tumor development in mice. From these studies, we suggest that Rev1 transgenic mouse may be a useful model system for the study of risk estimation of tritium induced cancers.

Furthermore, as the amount of discharged fuel from nuclear power plants increases, nuclear power plants are confronted with the problem of meeting storage capacity demand. Various measures have been taken to resolve this problem. Dry storage systems along with transportation of spent fuel either on-site or off-site are regarded as the most feasible measure. In order to develop dry storage and transportation system safety analyses, development of design techniques, full scale performance tests, and research on key material degradation should be conducted. This paper deals with two topics, structural analysis methodology to assess cumulative damage to transportation packages and the effects of an aircraft engine crash on a dual purpose cask. These newly emerging issues are selected from among the many technical issues related to the development of transportation and storage systems of spent fuels. In the design process, appropriate analytical methods, procedures, and tools are used in conjunction with a suitably selected test procedure and assumptions such as jet engine simulation for postulated design events and a beyond design basis accident.

In this study, the material properties of a low-pH cement grout based on a recipe used at ONKALO are investigated by considering such factors as pH variation, compressive strength, dynamic modulus, and hydraulic conductivity by using silica fume and micro-cement. From the pH measurements of the hardened cement grout, the required pH (< pH 11) is obtained after 130 days of curing. Although the engineering properties of the low-pH cement grout used in this study are inferior to those of conventional high-pH cement grout, the utilization of silica fume and micro-cement effectively meets the long-term environmental and durability requirements for cement grout in a radioactive waste repository.

Preliminary tests were performed using oxidized inconel samples which enabled the simulation of cobalt removal from the radioactive inconel samples. The oxygen in the oxidized samples and the cobalt in the radioactive inconel were removed more effectively using the blasting distance, blasting time, and a silicon carbide abrasive. Using the developed abrasive blasting equipment, the optimum decontamination conditions for radioactive inconel samples were blasting for more than 6 minutes using silicon carbides under 5 atmospheric pressures.

The technique uses the deflection of cosmic ray muons in matter to perform tomographic imaging of high-Z material inside a probed volume. A Muon Tomography Station (MTS) requires position-sensitive detectors with high spatial resolution for optimal tracking of incoming and outgoing cosmic ray muons. Micro Pattern Gaseous Detector (MPGD) technologies such as Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) detectors are excellent candidates for this application. We have built and operated a minimal MTS prototype based on 30 cm x 30 cm GEM detectors for probing targets with various Z values inside the MTS volume. We report the first successful detection and imaging of medium-Z and high-Z targets of small volumes (similar to 0.03 L) using GEM-based Muon Tomography. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Portnoy, D; Feuerbach, R; Heimberg, J				Portnoy, David; Feuerbach, Robert; Heimberg, Jennifer			Global parameter optimization for maximizing radioisotope detection probabilities at fixed false alarm rates	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Radiological and nuclear detection; Global optimization; Receiver operating characteristic; Homeland security		Today there is a tremendous amount of interest in systems that can detect radiological or nuclear threats. Many of these systems operate in extremely high throughput situations where delays caused by false alarms can have a significant negative impact. Thus, calculating the tradeoff between detection rates and false alarm rates is critical for their successful operation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves have long been used to depict this tradeoff. The methodology was first developed in the field of signal detection. In recent years it has been used increasingly in machine learning and data mining applications. It follows that this methodology could be applied to radiological/nuclear threat detection systems. However many of these systems do not fit into the classic principles of statistical detection theory because they tend to lack tractable likelihood functions and have many parameters, which, in general, do not have a onetoone correspondence with the detection classes. This work proposes a strategy to overcome these problems by empirically finding parameter values that maximize the probability of detection for a selected number of probabilities of false alarm. To find these parameter values a statistical global optimization technique that seeks to estimate portions of a ROC curve is proposed. The optimization combines elements of simulated annealing with elements of genetic algorithms. Genetic algorithms were chosen because they can reduce the risk of getting stuck in local minima. However classic genetic algorithms operate on arrays of Booleans values or bit strings, so simulated annealing is employed to perform mutation in the genetic algorithm. The presented initial results were generated using an isotope identification algorithm developed at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. The algorithm has 12 parameters: 4 realvalued and 8 Boolean. A simulated dataset was used for the optimization study; the "threat" set of spectra contained 540 SNM and industrial signatures, and the "benign" set of spectra contained 240 NORM and medical signatures. As compared to a random parameter search, the statistical optimization was able to able to find parameters that yield significantly higher probabilities of detection for all probabilities of false alarm from 0 to 0.1 (and equal to for probabilities of false alarm greater than 0.1), in a relatively small number of iterations. The number of iterations used, 1000, is also many fewer than would be required for a reasonable systematic search of the parameter space. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Neutron sensors and their role in nuclear nonproliferation	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Neutron detection; Nuclear threat detection; Special nuclear material safeguards; Radiation portal monitoring; Treaty verification		Perhaps the most familiar application of neutron detection technology to nonproliferation resides in materials accounting, where the quantification of plutonium has a rich history. With a changing dynamic in nuclear security, the application of sensor technology to further other nonproliferation objectives has received considerable attention. This fact, amplified by a dwindling supply of He-3, has stimulated considerable interest in neutron detection technology development for applications ranging from interdicting smuggled nuclear material to the verification of stockpile reductions. This manuscript briefly overviews the application of neutron sensors to nonproliferation and examines three specific examples that highlight the constraints applied to field-deployed technology.

SENTIRAD-An innovative personal radiation detector based on a scintillation detector and a silicon photomultiplier	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Silicon photomultiplier; Personal radiation detector; Scintillator; Dose-rate		The alarming personal radiation detector (PRD) is a device intended for Homeland Security (HLS) applications. This portable device is designed to be worn or carried by security personnel to detect photon-emitting radioactive materials for the purpose of crime prevention. PRD is required to meet the scope of specifications defined by various HLS standards for radiation detection. It is mandatory that the device be sensitive and simultaneously small, pocket-sized, of robust mechanical design and carriable on the user's body. To serve these specialized purposes and requirements, we developed the SENTIRAD, a new radiation detector designed to meet the performance criteria established for counterterrorist applications. SENTIRAD is the first commercially available PRD based on a CsI(Tl) scintillation crystal that is optically coupled with a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) serving as a light sensor. The rapidly developing technology of SiPM, a multipixel semiconductor photodiode that operates in Geiger mode, has been thoroughly investigated in previous studies. This paper presents the design considerations, constraints and radiological performance relating to the SENTIRAD radiation sensor. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Long range active detection of HEU based on thermal neutron multiplication	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Spallation; Thermal neutrons; Fast neutrons; Fission; Pulse shape discrimination; High band width data recording		We report on the results of measurements of proton irradiation on a series of targets at Brookhaven National Laboratory's (BNL) Alternate Gradient Synchrotron Facility (AGS), in collaboration with Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL). We examined the prompt radiation environment in the tunnel for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) sponsored series (E-972), which investigated the penetration of air and subsequent target interaction of 4 GeV proton pulses. Measurements were made by means of an organic scintillator with a 500 MHz bandwidth system. We found that irradiation of a depleted uranium (DU) target resulted in a large gamma-ray signal in the 100-500 mu s time region after the proton flash when DU was surrounded by polyethylene, but little signal was generated if it was surrounded by boron-loaded polyethylene. Subsequent Monte Carlo (MCNPX) calculations indicated that the source of the signal was consistent with thermal neutron capture in DU. The MCNPX calculations also indicated that if one were to perform the same experiment with highly enriched uranium (HEU) target there would be a distinctive fast neutron yield in this 100-500 mu s time region from thermal neutron-induced fission. The fast neutrons can be recorded by the same direct current system and differentiated from gamma-ray pulses in organic scintillator by pulse shape discrimination. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Measurement of Ar-37 to support technology for On-Site Inspection under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Nuclear weapons monitoring; CTBT On-Site Inspection; Radioactive argon isotopes; Low energy threshold proportional counter		On-Site Inspection (OSI) is a key component of the verification regime for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). Measurements of radionuclide isotopes created by an underground nuclear explosion are a valuable signature of a Treaty violation. Argon-37 is produced by neutron interaction with calcium in soil, Ca-40(n,alpha)Ar-37. For OSI, the 35-day half-life of Ar-37 provides both high specific activity and sufficient time for completion of an inspection before decay limits sensitivity. This paper presents a low-background internal-source gas proportional counter with an Ar-37 measurement sensitivity level equivalent to 45 mBq/SCM in whole air. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Automated nondestructive assay of UF6 cylinders: Detector characterization and initial measurements	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Nondestructive assay; Nuclear fuel cycle; Safeguards; UF6		International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors currently perform periodic inspections at uranium enrichment plants to verify UF6 cylinder enrichment declarations. Measurements are typically performed with handheld high-resolution sensors on a sampling of cylinders taken to be representative of the facility's entire cylinder inventory. These measurements are time-consuming and assay only a small fraction of the total cylinder volume. An automated nondestructive assay system capable of providing enrichment measurements over the full volume of the cylinder could improve upon current verification practices in terms of manpower and assay accuracy. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is developing an Integrated Cylinder Verification System (ICVS) intended for this purpose and has developed a field prototype of the nondestructive assay (NDA) components of an ICVS. The nondestructive assay methods would combine the "traditional" enrichment-meter signature (i.e. 186-keV emission from U-235) as well as "nontraditional" high-energy photon signatures derived from neutrons produced primarily by F-19(alpha,n) reactions. This paper describes the design, calibration and characterization of the NaI(Tl) and LaBr3(Ce) spectrometers utilized in the field prototype. An overview of a recent field measurement campaign is then provided, supported by example gamma-ray pulse-height spectra collected on cylinders of known enrichment. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Next Generation Safeguards Initiative research to determine the Pu mass in spent fuel assemblies: Purpose, approach, constraints, implementation, and calibration	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Spent fuel measurements; Plutonium mass; Non-destructive assay		The Next Generation Safeguards Initiative (NGSI) of the U.S. Department of Energy has funded a multi-lab/multi-university collaboration to quantify the plutonium mass in spent nuclear fuel assemblies and to detect the diversion of pins from them. The goal of this research effort is to quantify the capability of various non-destructive assay (NDA) technologies as well as to train a future generation of safeguards practitioners. This research is "technology driven" in the sense that we will quantify the capabilities of a wide range of safeguards technologies of interest to regulators and policy makers: a key benefit to this approach is that the techniques are being tested in a unified manner. When the results of the Monte Carlo modeling are evaluated and integrated, practical constraints are part of defining the potential context in which a given technology might be applied. This paper organizes the commercial spent fuel safeguard needs into four facility types in order to identify any constraints on the NDA system design. These four facility types are the following: future reprocessing plants, current reprocessing plants, once-through spent fuel repositories, and any other sites that store individual spent fuel assemblies (reactor sites are the most common facility type in this category). Dry storage is not of interest since individual assemblies are not accessible. This paper will overview the purpose and approach of the NGSI spent fuel effort and describe the constraints inherent in commercial fuel facilities. It will conclude by discussing implementation and calibration of measurement systems. This report will also provide some motivation for considering a couple of other safeguards concepts (base measurement and fingerprinting) that might meet the safeguards need but not require the determination of plutonium mass.

Preparation of drop-deposited quantitative uranium sources with low self-absorption	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Source preparation; Uranium; Quantitative sources; Self-absorption	PRIMARY STANDARDIZATION	A source preparation procedure was optimised for (235)U sources of about 1 mg or 100 Bq, to be standardised for their activity concentrations by alpha-particle counting at a defined solid angle. The aim was to obtain quantitative sources having a thin, homogeneous active layer with low self-absorption of the emitted alpha-particles. The procedure involves spraying the wetting and seeding agent in a circular shape onto a glass or stainless steel substrate, quantitative drop deposition of active solution onto the sprayed area by the pycnometer method and fast drying of the source on a heating plate. The fraction of heavily scattered and self-absorbed alpha-particles could be reduced to 0.05-0.1% for a majority of the sources. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Measurement of gamma and neutron radiations inside spent fuel assemblies with passive detectors	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Fuel burn-up; Fuel assembly; Spent fuel; Alanine dosimeter; Track detector	DOSIMETRY	During operation of a fission nuclear reactor, many radionuclides are generated in fuel by fission and activation of (235)U, (238)U and other nuclides present in the assembly. After removal of a fuel assembly from the core, these radionuclides are sources of different types of radiation. Gamma and neutron radiation emitted from an assembly can be non-destructively detected with different types of detectors. In this paper, a new method of measurement of radiation from a spent fuel assembly is presented. It is based on usage of passive detectors, such as alanine dosimeters for gamma radiation and track detectors for neutron radiation. Measurements are made on the IRT-2M spent fuel assemblies used in the LVR-15 research reactor. During irradiation of detectors, the fuel assembly is located in a water storage pool at a depth of 6 m. Detectors are inserted into central hole of the assembly, irradiated for a defined time interval, and after the detectors removed from the assembly, gamma dose or neutron fluence are evaluated.

Monte Carlo simulations of differential die-away instrument for determination of fissile content in spent fuel assemblies	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Differential die-away; Spent fuel assembly; Effective (239)Pu mass		The differential die-away (DDA) technique has been simulated by using the MCNPX code to quantify its capability of measuring the fissile content in spent fuel assemblies. For 64 different spent fuel cases of various initial enrichment, burnup and cooling time, the count rate and signal to background ratios of the DDA system were obtained, where neutron backgrounds are mainly coming from the (244)Cm of the spent fuel. To quantify the total fissile mass of spent fuel, a concept of the effective (239)Pu mass was introduced by weighing the relative contribution to the signal of (235)U and (241)Pu compared to (239)Pu and the calibration curves of DDA count rate vs. (239)Pu(eff) were obtained by using the MCNPX code. With a deuterium-tritium (DT) neutron generator of 10(9) n/s strength, signal to background ratios of sufficient magnitude are acquired for a DDA system with the spent fuel assembly in water.

Flux monitor diode radiation hardness testing	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Diode radiation hardness; X-ray tube; Enrichment monitor; Gas centrifuge enrichment plant		A flux monitor diode is being explored as an option for measurement of the output of an X-ray tube that is used for active transmission measurements on a pipe containing UF(6) gas. The measured flux can be used to correct for any instabilities in the X-ray tube or the high voltage power supply. For this measurement, we are using a silicon junction p-n photodiode, model AXUV100GX, developed by International Radiation Detectors, Inc. (IRD, Inc.). This diode has a silicon thickness of 104 mu and a thin (3-7 nm) silicon dioxide junction passivating, protective entrance window. These diodes have been extensively tested for radiation hardness in the UV range. However, we intend to operate mainly in the 10-40 key X-ray region. We are performing radiation hardness testing over this energy range, with the energy spectrum that would pass through the diode during normal operation. A long-term measurement was performed at a high flux, which simulated over 80 years of operation. No significant degradation was seen over this time. Fluctuations were found to be within the 0.1% operationally acceptable error range. After irradiation, an I-V characterization showed a temporary irradiation effect which decayed over time. This effect is small because we operate the diode without external bias. Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Lombardi, M. L.; Favalli, A.; Goda, J. M.; Ianakiev, K. D.; Moss, C.

An isotope identification injection study with GammaTracker	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Isotope identification; Gamma-ray spectroscopy; CdZnTe detectors		GammaTracker is a portable handheld radioisotope identifier using position sensitive CdZnTe detectors. High confidence isotope identification is possible on GammaTracker owing to the system's relatively high energy resolution and count rate sensitivity. A study was undertaken to evaluate the isotope identification performance of a prototype unit. Background and source spectra for various nuclides were measured and then randomly sampled to simulate various integration times and source intensities. The resulting spectral data sets were then run through the isotope identification algorithm to determine the probability of detection and the false alarm rate for each nuclide. The process was repeated for various isotope identification input parameters until an optimized set was achieved. This paper presents results from the injection study. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

High-fidelity MCNP modeling of a D-T neutron generator for active interrogation of special nuclear material	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						D-T generator; SNM detection; Active interrogation		Fast and robust methods for interrogation of special nuclear material (SNM) are of interest to many agencies and institutions in the United States. It is well known that passive interrogation methods are typically sufficient for plutonium identification because of a relatively high neutron production rate from (240)Pu [1]. On the other hand, identification of shielded uranium requires active methods using neutron or photon sources [2]. Deuterium-deuterium (2.45 MeV) and deuterium-tritium (14.1 MeV) neutron-generator sources have been previously tested and proven to be relatively reliable instruments for active interrogation of nuclear materials [3,4]. In addition, the newest generators of this type are small enough for applications requiring portable interrogation systems. Active interrogation techniques using high-energy neutrons are being investigated as a method to detect hidden SNM in shielded containers [4,5]. Due to the thickness of some containers, penetrating radiation such as high-energy neutrons can provide a potential means of probing shielded SNM. In an effort to develop the capability to assess the signal seen from various forms of shielded nuclear materials, the University of Michigan Neutron Science Laboratory's D-T neutron generator and its shielding were accurately modeled in MCNP. The generator, while operating at nominal power, produces approximately 1 x 10(10) neutrons/s, a source intensity which requires a large amount of shielding to minimize the dose rates around the generator. For this reason, the existing shielding completely encompasses the generator and does not include beam ports. Therefore, several MCNP simulations were performed to estimate the yield of uncollided 14.1-MeV neutrons from the generator for active interrogation experiments. Beam port diameters of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 cm were modeled to assess the resulting neutron fluxes. The neutron flux outside the beam ports was estimated to be approximately 2 x 10(4) n/cm(2) s.

The system, called Photofission Based Alarm Resolution (PBAR) is being developed under a DHD/DNDO Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) program. The PBAR system is based on the Rapiscan Eagle P9000 X-ray system, which is a portal system with a commercial 9 MeV LINAC X-ray source. For the purposes of the DNDO ATD program, a conveyor system was installed in the portal to allow scanning and precise positioning of 20 ft ISO cargo containers. The system uses a two step inspection process. In the first step, the basic scan, the container is quickly and completely inspected using two independent radiography arrays: the conventional primary array with high spatial resolution and a lower resolution spectroscopic array employing the novel Z-Spec method. The primary array uses cadmium tungstate (CdWO(4)) detectors with conventional current mode readouts using photodiodes. The Z-Spec array uses small plastic scintillators capable of performing very fast (up to 10(8) cps) gamma-ray spectroscopy. The two radiography arrays are used to locate high-Z objects in the image such as lead, tungsten, uranium, which could be potential shielding materials as well as SNM itself. In the current system, the Z-Spec works by measuring the energy spectrum of transmitted X-rays. For high-Z materials the higher end of the energy spectrum is more attenuated than for low-Z materials and thus has a lower mean energy and a narrower width than low- and medium-Z materials. The second step in the inspection process is the direct scan or alarm clearing scan. In this step, areas of the container image, which were identified as high Z, are re-inspected. This is done by precisely repositioning the container to the location of the high-Z object and performing a stationary irradiation of the area with X-ray beam. Since there are a large number of photons in the 9 MV Bremsstrahlung spectrum above the photofission "threshold" of about 6 MeV, the X-ray beam induces numerous fissions if nuclear material is present. The PBAR system looks for the two most prolific fission signatures to confirm the presence of special nuclear materials (SNM). These are prompt neutrons and delayed gamma rays. The PBAR system uses arrays of two types of fast and highly efficient gamma ray detectors: plastic and fluorocarbon scintillators. The latter serves as a detector of fission prompt neutrons using the novel threshold activation detector (TAD) concept as well as a very efficient delayed gamma ray detector. The major advantage of TAD for detecting the prompt neutrons is its insensitivity to the intense source related backgrounds. The current status of the system and experimental results will be shown and discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Detection of SNM by delayed gamma rays from induced fission	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Neutron generator; SNM detection; Scintillation detector; NDA; Illicit trafficking; Nuclear security	NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS	The Pulsed Neutron Interrogation Test Assembly (PUNITA) is an experimental device for research in NDA methods and field applicable instrumentation for nuclear safeguards and security applications. PUNITA incorporates a standard 14-MeV (D-T) pulsed neutron generator inside a large graphite mantle. The generator target is surrounded by a thick tungsten filter with the purpose to increase the neutron output and to tailor the neutron energy spectrum. In this configuration a sample may be exposed to a relatively high average thermal neutron flux of about (2.2 +/- 0.1) x 10(3) s(-1) cm(-2) at only 10% of the maximum target neutron emission. The sample cavity is large enough to allow variation of the experimental setup including the fissile sample, neutron and gamma detectors, and shielding materials. The response from SNM samples of different fissile material content was investigated with various field-applicable scintillation gamma detectors such as the 3 x 2 in. LaBr3 detector. Shielding in the form of tungsten and cadmium was applied to the detector to improve the signal to background ratio. Gamma and neutron shields surrounding the samples were also tested for the purpose of simulating clandestine conduct. The energy spectra of delayed gamma rays were recorded in the range 100 keV-9 MeV. In addition time spectra of delayed gamma rays in the range 3.3-8 MeV were recorded in the time period of 10 ms-120 s after the 14-MeV neutron burst. The goal of the experiment was to optimize the sample/detector configuration including the energy range and time period for SNM detection. The results show, for example, that a 170 g sample of depleted uranium can be detected with the given setup in less than 3 min of investigation. Samples of higher enrichment or higher mass are detected in much shorter time. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To counter this problem we have developed a technique that uses a Cerium doped Lanthanum-Tri-Chloride (LaCl3:Ce) scintillation detector to provide gated gammas (Guillot-Noel et al. (1999) [1] and van Loef et al. (2001) [2]). Exploiting the inherent radioactivity of the LaCl3:Ce due to the long-lived radioactive isotope La-138 (t(1/2)=1.06 x 10(11) yr) allows the use of the 788 and 1436 keV gammas as a measure of efficiency. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of using the beta-gamma coincidences radiation LaCl3:Ce detector to calibrate the energy and efficiency of a number of gamma-ray detectors.

Ce:LLF and Ce:LSBO demonstrated similar to 80% transparency at wavelengths longer than 300 and 400 nm, respectively. When excited by Am-241 alpha-ray to obtain radioactive luminescence spectra, Ce3+ 5d-4f emission peaks were detected at around 320 nm for Ce:LLF and at around 380 nm for Ce:LSBO. In Ce:LSBO, the host luminescence was also observed at 260 nm. By recording pulse height spectra under gamma-ray irradiation, the absolute light yield of Ce:LLF and Ce:LSBO was measured to be 3600 +/- 400 and 4200 +/- 400 ph/MeV, respectively. Decay time kinetics was also investigated using a pulse X-ray equipped streak camera system. The main component of Ce:LLF was similar to 320 ns and that of Ce:LSBO was similar to 31 ns. In addition, the light yield non-proportionality and energy resolution against the gamma-ray energy were evaluated. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Growth and characterization of polycrystalline lanthanide halide scintillators	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Lanthanide halide; Polycrystalline scintillator films; Gamma ray imaging		We are exploring a novel time- and cost-efficient approach to produce robust, large-volume polycrystalline lanthanide halide scintillators using a hot wall evaporation (HWE) technique. To date, we have fabricated LaBr(3):Ce and LaCI(3):Ce films (slabs) measuring up to 7 cm in diameter and 7+ mm in thickness (20-25 cm(3) in volume) on quartz substrates. These polycrystalline scintillators exhibit very bright emissions approaching those exhibited by their melt-grown crystal counterparts. Scanning electron micrographs (SEMs) and X-ray diffraction analysis confirm polycrystalline growth with columnar structures, both of which help in light piping, thereby contributing to the observed high light yields. The new scintillators also exhibit good energy resolution for gamma-rays over the tested range of 60 key ((241)Am) to 662 key ((137)Cs), although they have not yet reached that of the corresponding crystals. The measured response linearity over the same energy range is comparable for both our HWE synthesized films and melt-grown commercially-available reference crystals. Similar consistency in response is also observed in terms of their decay time and afterglow behaviors. The data collected so far demonstrate that our HWE technique permits the rapid creation of scintillators with desired structural and compositional characteristics, without the introduction of appreciable defects, and yields material performance equivalent to or approaching that of crystals. Consequently, the deposition parameters may be manipulated to tailor the physical and scintillation performance of the resulting structures, while achieving a cost per unit volume that is substantially lower than that of crystals. In turn, this promises to allow the use of these novel scintillation materials in such applications as SPECT, PET, room-temperature radioisotope identification and homeland security, where large volumes of materials in a wide variety of shapes and sizes are needed. This paper describes our growth and testing of polycrystalline LaBr3:Ce scintillators and provides comparative characterizations of their performance with crystals. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Large microcalorimeter arrays for high-resolution X- and gamma-ray spectroscopy	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Microcalorimeter; Gamma-ray; High-resolution; Spectroscopy		Microcalorimeter detectors provide unprecedented energy resolution for the measurement of X-rays and soft gamma-rays. Energy resolution in the 100 keV region can be up to an order of magnitude better than planar high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors. The technology is well-suited to analysis of materials with complex spectra presenting closely spaced photopeaks. One application area is the measurement and assay of nuclear materials for safeguards and fuel cycle applications. In this paper, we discuss the operation and performance of a 256-pixel array, and present results of a head-to-head comparison of isotopic determination measurements with high-purity germanium using a plutonium standard. We show that the uncertainty of a single measurement is smaller for the microcalorimeter data compared to the HPGe data when photopeak areas are equal. We identify several key areas where analysis codes can be optimized that will likely lead to improvement in the microcalorimeter performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Hoover, A.

Three crystals: high-doping Ce:LiCAF, low-doping Ce:LiCAF with 50% enrichment of Li-6 (both 10 mm x 10 mm x 2 mm, rectangular) and high-doping Ce:LiCAF with 95% enrichment of Li-6 (050.8 mm x 2 mm, discus) coupled to Photonis XP5300B PMT, were tested. The response of these crystals to neutrons emitted from a paraffin moderated (PuBe)-Pu-238 source has been investigated. Thermal neutron peaks have been found at a Gamma Equivalent Energy (GEE) of similar to 2.5 MeV for high-doping Ce:LiCAF (50% 6Li), similar to 2 MeV for low-doping Ce:LiCAF (50% Li-6) and similar to 1.9 MeV for high-doping Ce:LiCAF (95% Li-6). The light output of Ce:LiCAF was also measured (175-250 phe/MeV from sample to sample). Lithium-6 glass GS20 from Saint Gobain was used as a reference scintillator (050 mm x 2 mm, circle). Relative neutron efficiency, normalized to that of GS20 lithium glass, as well as gamma-neutron intrinsic efficiency for all tested samples was calculated. Intrinsic efficiency on thermal neutron detection for small Ce:LiCAF samples was estimated at about 32-35% of that of GS20 and for large Ce:LiCAF sample as about 82% of that of GS20.

It consists of a 132% efficient HPGe detector, graded lead shielding, and muon-rejection shielding, as well as external steel and building shielding. Detailed operation of the gamma spectrometer and all of its components is described. Cosmic-ray muon and cosmic-neutron-induced background was accurately measured, and is discussed. We have achieved an overall background reduction by a factor of 9436 relative to the ambient level. Our integrated background rate in the gamma energy range of 50-2700 keV was measured as 2.3 counts per min, corresponding to 15 counts ks(-1) kg(-1) Ge. Future directions in low-background gamma spectroscopy at our facility are described. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Haines, D. K.; Semkow, T. M.; Khan, A. J.; Hoffman, T. J.; Meyer, S.
