Thermodynamic parameters and sorption of U(VI) on ACSD	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; ACTIVATED-CHARCOAL; NATURAL BENTONITE; ADSORPTION; URANIUM; BIOSORPTION; COMPLEXES; REMOVAL; NICKEL; CARBON	This paper discusses the sorption properties for U(VI) by alginate coated CaSO(4)center dot 2H(2)O sepiolite and calcined diatomite earth (Kieselguhr) (ACSD). The removal of U(VI) from aqueous solution by sorption onto ACSF in a single component system with various contact times, pH, temperatures, and initial concentrations of U(VI) was investigated. The sorption patterns of uranium on the composite adsorbent followed the Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkhevic (D-R) isotherms. The Freundlich, Langmuir, and D-R models have been applied and the data correlated well with Freundlich model and that the sorption was physical in nature (sorption energy, E (a) = 17.05 kJ/mol). The thermodynamic parameters such as variation of enthalpy Delta H, variation of entropy Delta S and variation of Gibbs free energy Delta G were calculated from the slope and intercept of lnK (0) vs. 1/T plots. Thermodynamic parameters (Delta H (ads) = 31.83 kJ/mol, Delta S (ads) = 167 J/mol center dot K, Delta G (o) (ads) (293.15 K) = -17.94 kJ/mol) showed the endothermic heat of sorption and the feasibility of the process. The thermodynamics of U(VI) ion/ACSD system indicates the spontaneous and endothermic nature of the process. It was noted that an increase in temperature resulted in a higher uranium loading per unit weight of the adsorbent.	[Donat, R.; Cilgi, G.

The decrease in radioactive concentration or specific volume concentration of Tc-99m places a limitation on some pharmaceutical kits (DTPA, MIBI, ECD, etc.) or clinical procedures. We report on the post elution concentration of Tc-99m using in house prepared lead cation-exchange and alumina columns. Using these columns high bolus volumes (10-60 mL 0.02M sodium sulfate) of Tc-99m can conveniently be concentrated in 1 mL of physiological saline. This approach also works very effectively to prepare high specific volume solutions of Tc-99m-pertechnetate from a fission based Mo-99/Tc-99m generator in the second week of its normal working life.

The equilibrium data have been explained assuming that the cations HL(2)(+), ML(2)(3+) and ML(3)(3+) (M(3)(+) = Eu(3)(+), Am(3)(+)) are extracted into the organic phase. The values of extraction and stability constants of the species in nitrobenzene saturated with water have been determined. It has been found that the stability constants of the corresponding complexes EuL(n)(3+) and AmL(n)(3+), where n = 2,3 and L is DBDMDDOEMA, in water saturated nitrobenzene are comparable.

The reduction of Pu(IV) by DHU was investigated using UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The reduction back-extraction behavior of Pu(IV) in 30% tri-butyl phosphate/kerosene was firstly investigated under conditions of various temperature, various DHU and HNO(3) concentrations and various phase contact times. The results showed that Pu(IV) in the organic phase can be stripped rapidly to the aqueous phase by DHU. Simulating the 1B contactor of the PUREX process using a 0.1 M DHU in 0.36M nitric acid solution as the stripping agent, the separation factors of uranium/plutonium can reach 2.1 center dot 10(4). This indicates that DHU is a promising salt free agent for uranium/plutonium separation.

Improvement in the determination of traces of uranium in aqueous medium having high dissolved organic carbon and chloride ion by alpha-spectrometry	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ADSORPTIVE STRIPPING VOLTAMMETRY; SERIES NUCLIDES; GROUNDWATER; URANYL(VI); WATER; SEA	During this work the determination of uranium in the range of mu g center dot L(-1) to tens of mu g center dot L(-1) was done by alpha-spectrometry after electroplating the aliquots of water sample using (NH(4))(2)SO(4) as an electrolyte. In general, the determination of uranium by alpha-spectrometry needs its separation from other transuranics specially thorium. The process described here does not involve any sample digestion and radiochemical separation of uranium from other transuranics. In this method an aliquot (1 to 3 mL) of the sample was dried and dissolve in (NH(4))(2)SO(4) and thereafter the sample was electroplated on a stainless steel (SS) planchet by using an electrochemical cell of special design. The proposed techniques have a distinct advantage over the determination of uranium by adsorptive stripping voltammetry (AdSV) in which uranium-chloranilic (2,5-dichloro-3,6-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone) acid complex was used for concentrating the uranium from the solution. Since in the case of AdSv, the determination of uranium was not possible for samples having dissolved organic carbon (DOC) more than 15 mg center dot L(-1) and Cl(-) concentration is in the range of 40,000 mu center dot g(-1). In the case of spike experiments with (232)U the recovery was observed in the range of 90-95% in aqueous medium having higher concentration of Cl(-) and DOC as indicated above.	[Singhal, R.

About 83% of I(-) was oxidized to IO(3) (-) and 10% of I(-) was oxidized to I(2) in uranyl nitrate solution after heating at 70 A degrees C for 6 hours. Heating and existence of oxidant, U and ionizing radiation accelerate the oxidation process of iodine, and results in most of the iodine being produced in high oxidation states such as in IO(3) (-) and IO(4) (-). The results indicate that the production of (131)I by MIPR can be carried out by extraction of iodine in high oxidation states from the fuel solution.

J	Zhang, HX; Yang, C; Tao, ZY				Zhang Hongxia; Yang Chao; Tao Zuyi			Effects of phosphate and fulvic acid on the sorption and transport of uranium(VI) on silica column	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							IONIC-STRENGTH; CONTACT TIME; REACTIVE TRANSPORT; HUMIC SUBSTANCES; URANYL IONS; ADSORPTION; GOETHITE; TH(IV); SAND; PH	Column experiments were performed, breakthrough curves (BTCs) and displacement curves (DPCs) were obtained of uranium(VI) in the absence and presence of phosphate or fulvic acid individually and simultaneously which demonstrated the effects of phosphate and fulvic acid on the sorption and transport of U(VI) in a silica column at pH 3.7 and U(VI) concentration of 5 center dot 10(-6) mol/L. It was found that in the presence of phosphate or fulvic acid sorbed preliminarily on the silica column, the amount of U(VI) sorbed increased significantly and the transport of U(VI) delayed significantly relative to that in the absence of phosphate or fulvic acid. Moreover, in the presence of phosphate and fulvic acids sorbed preliminarily and simultaneously on the silica column, the amount of U(VI) sorbed on the silica column is significantly increased again relative to that in the presence of phosphate or fulvic acid individually. Transport studies of U(VI) are important, since all uranium isotopes are radioactive, and uranium contamination of soils and groundwaters occurs at mining and mill sites. A fundamental understanding of the transport behavior of U(VI) in the water-mineral systems is necessary for accurate risk assessments.

The Ignalina NPP Unit I was shutdown at the end of 2004, while Unit 2 is foreseen to be shutdown at the end of 2009. At the Ignalina NPP Unit I remains approximately 1000 spent fuel assemblies with low burn-up depth. A special set of equipment was developed to reuse these assemblies in the reactor of Unit 2. One of most important items of this set is a container, which is used for the transportation of spent fuel assemblies between the reactors of Unit I and Unit 2. A special shock absorber was designed to avoid failure of fuel assemblies in case of hypothetical spent fuel assemblies drop accident during uploading/unloading of spent fuel assemblies to/from container. This shock absorber was examined by using scaled experiments. The objective of this article is the estimation whether the proposed design of shock absorber fulfils the function of the absorber and the optimization of its geometrical parameters using the results of the performed investigations. Static analytical and experimental investigations are presented in the article. The finite element code BRIGADE/Plus was used for the analytical analysis. The calculation model was verified by comparing the experimental investigation and Simulation results for further employment of this finite element model in the development of an optimum design of shock absorber. Static simulation was used to perform primary optimization of design and dimension of the shock absorber. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This waste originates from different producers: nuclear power plants, medical applications, industry, research centre, etc. During the past 25 years several preliminary repository designs were proposed. Today, the cylindrical supercontainer is considered to be the most promising Belgian design on the matter of enclosing the vitrified high level radioactive waste (HLW) and the spent fuel assemblies and is based oil the use of an integrated waste package composed of a carbon steel overpack surrounded by an Ordinary Portland Cement buffer. For the choice of this cementious buffer two compositions, a self-compacting concrete (SCC) and a traditional vibrated concrete (TVC), are being considered, tested and compared by means of an intensive laboratory characterization program. Through-going cracks in the concrete buffer Should, at all times, be avoided because they will considerably ease the transport mechanisms inside the supercontainer. Therefore, finite element Simulations are performed, using a 2.5-D thermal and crack modelling program, to predict the mechanical and thermal behaviour of the concrete buffer at any time during hardening. Looking at the finite element Simulation results of the first stage of manufacturing of the supercontainer (cast in one), and the emplacement of the heat-emitting waste canister (second stage), we experience no early age cracking of the concrete buffer. The impact of environmental conditions and shrinkage and creep behaviour oil the simulation results are noticeable. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ko, YY; Hsu, SY; Chen, CH				Ko, Yung-Yen; Hsu, Shang-Yi; Chen, Cheng-Hsing			Analysis for seismic response of dry storage facility for spent fuel	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								Most of the dry storage systems for spent fuel are freestanding, which leads to stability concerns in an earthquake. In this study, as a safety check, the ABAQUS/Explicit code is adopted to analyse the seismic response of the dry storage facility planned to be installed at Nuclear Power Plant #1 (NPP1) in Taiwan. A 3D coupled finite element (FE) model was established, which consisted of a freestanding cask, a concrete pad, and underneath soils interacting with frictional contact interfaces. The scenario earthquake used in the model included an artificial earthquake compatible to the design spectrum of NPP1, and a strong ground motion modified from the time history recorded during the Chi-Chi earthquake. The results show that the freestanding cask will slide, but not tip over, during strong earthquakes. The scale of the sliding is very small and a collision between casks will not occur. In addition, the differential settlement of the foundation pad that takes place due to the weight of the casks increases the sliding potential of the casks during earthquakes. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Assessment of flow induced vibration in a sodium-sodium heat exchanger	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								The 500 MWe Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) is under construction at Kalpakkam. It is a liquid metal sodium cooled pool type fast reactor with all primary components located inside a sodium pool. The heat produced due to fission in the core is transported by primary sodium to the secondary sodium in a sodium to sodium Intermediate Heat Exchanger (IHX), which in turn is transferred to water in the steam generator. PFBR IHX is a shell and tube type heat exchanger with primary Sodium on shell side and secondary sodium in the tube side. Since IHX is one of the critical components placed inside the radioactive primary sodium, trouble-free operation of the IHX is very much essential for power plant availability. To validate the design and the adequacy of the support system provided for the IHX, flow induced vibration (FIV) experiments were carried Out in a water test loop on a 60 degrees sector model. This paper discusses the flow induced vibration measurements carried Out in 60 degrees sector model of IHX, the modeling criteria, the results and conclusion. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Recent results on the properties of two-phase argon avalanche detectors	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Two-phase avalanche detectors; Gas electron multipliers; Liquid argon; CsI photocathodes; Scintillations in noble liquids	GAS ELECTRON MULTIPLIERS; DARK-MATTER SEARCH; LIQUID ARGON; XENON; GEM; OPERATION; ARDM	The characteristic properties of two-phase argon (At) avalanche detectors, including those obtained with CsI photocathode, are further studied. Such detectors are relevant in the field of coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering and dark-matter search experiments. The detectors investigated comprised a I cm thick liquid Ar layer followed by a triple-gas electron multipliers (GEMS). In these detectors, typical gains reaching 10(4) were obtained with good reproducibility and a stable operation for at least I day was demonstrated. Amplitude and pulse-shape characteristics are presented under irradiation with X-rays, gamma rays and neutrons from different radioactive sources. The detection of both primary scintillation and ionization signals at higher gains, at a deposited energy of 60 keV, has been demonstrated. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The samples were irradiated with 10 mCi Cd-109 and 100 mCi AM-241 radioactive point source using transmission arrangement. The gamma- and X-rays were counted by a Si(Li) detector with a resolution of 160 eV at 5.9 keV. Total atomic and electronic cross-sections (sigma(t) and sigma(e)), effective atomic and electron numbers (Z(eff) and N(eff)) were determined experimentally and theoretically using the obtained mass attenuation coefficients for investigated 3d alloys. The theoretical mass attenuation coefficients of each alloy were estimated using mixture rule. The experimental values were compared with the calculated values for all samples. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Evaluated activation cross sections of longer-lived radionuclides produced by deuteron induced reactions on natural iron up to 10 MeV	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Natural iron target; Deuteron irradiation; Cyclotron; Excitation function; Cross section; Cobalt-57 radioisotope; Thin layer activation; Monitor reaction	EXCITATION-FUNCTIONS; FE; TI	Charged particle induced reactions can be used to monitor in real time the wear of mechanical structures such as internal combustion engines and turbines. Charged particle induced reactions with suitable properties also can be used for monitoring the actual parameters of bombarding particle beams. One of these reactions is the (nat)Fe(d,x)(57)Co process. The available experimental data in the literature are well established around and above the maximum of the excitation function, however only a little, scattered data are available in the threshold energy region of the reaction. In this work we measured the excitation functions of relevant processes resulting in (55,56,57,58)Co, (59)Fe and (52,54)Mn induced by deuteron beams on natural iron in the energy range from threshold up to 10 MeV. The new experimental data collected are used to determine with high confidence recommended values for the missing low energy part of the investigated excitation functions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Fine-structure effects on the polarization of K alpha(1) radiation from heavy, highly-charged ions	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th Conference on Elementary Processes in Atomic Systems	JUN 18-20, 2008	Cluj Napoca, ROMANIA	Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Phys, Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Nucl Res		X-ray polarization; Fine-structure effects; Highly-charged ions	ELECTRON-CAPTURE; ATOM COLLISIONS	Radiative decay of heavy, few-electron ions following electron capture is studied within the framework of the density matrix theory combined with the multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock approach. Special attention is paid to the linear polarization of the decay X-ray photons. Detailed calculations have been carried out, in particular, for the K alpha(1) (1s2P(3/2)(1,3)p(1,2) -> 1s(21)S(0)) transition in helium-like uranium U90+ ions. For this line, the characteristic radiation is almost unpolarized as a result of the superposition of its fine-structure P-1(1) -> S-1(0) and P-3(2) -> S-1(0) components which are strongly linearly polarized in perpendicular directions.

Surface morphology influence on deuterium retention in beryllium films prepared by thermionic vacuum arc method	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th Conference on Elementary Processes in Atomic Systems	JUN 18-20, 2008	Clu Napoca, ROMANIA	Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Phys, Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Nucl Res		Thermionic vacuum arc; Beryllium; Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS); Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)		In a plasma-confinement device, material eroded from plasma facing components will be transported and re-deposited at other locations inside the reaction chamber. Since beryllium from the first wall of the ITER fusion reactor will be eroded, ionized in the scrape-off layer plasma and finally re-deposited on divertor surfaces flowing along the magnetic field, it is important to study the properties of divertor armour materials (C,W) coated with beryllium. By applying different bias voltages (-200 V to +700 V) to the substrates during deposition, the morphology of the obtained films was modified. The films' morphology was characterized by means of AFM and SEM, and it was found that the coatings prepared using negative bias voltage at the substrate during deposition are more compact and have a smoother surface compared to the samples prepared with positive bias voltage. The thickness and composition of each film were measured using Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS). A study of deuterium implantation and retention into the prepared films was performed at IPP Catching in the high current ion source. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The P/D ratio required to achieve a nearly burnup-independent k(eff) over the life of the ENHS core was found sensitive to the initial composition of the transuranium (TRU) loaded and to the number of recycles this fuel underwent. The longer the cooling time is of the TRU from light water reactor (LWR) spent fuel, the larger the optimal P/D ratio becomes. Whereas the optimal P/D ratio of the reference ENHS core that is fueled with TRU from LWR spent fuel discharged at 50 GWd/t heavy metal (HM) and cooled for 10 yr is 1.36, it is 1.54 for the equilibrium core that features a substantially smaller concentration of (241)Pu as well as of (242)Pu, a larger concentration of (239)Pu, and a substantially larger concentration of minor actinides. It was found that by increasing the cooling period of the above LWR TRU to similar to 32 yr, the optimal first core P/D ratio is that of the equilibrium core. The burnup reactivity swing of the subsequent cores fueled with successive recycling of the ENHS discharged HM is satisfactory. There is no need to adjust the core P/D ratio from recycle to recycle. The power level that can be removed by natural circulation from the P/D = 1.54 core is similar to 36% higher than that of the reference ENHS core. The physical phenomena affecting the observed trends are discussed, and the neutronic characteristics of the equilibrium cores identified are summarized.

Possible Configurations for the Thorium Molten Salt Reactor and Advantages of the Fast Nonmoderated Version	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							MSBR	Molten Salt Reactors based on the thorium cycle were studied in the 1950 to 1960s to lead to the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor concept, which was finally discontinued prior to any industrial development. In the past few years, this concept has once again been studied in order to generalize it and seek configurations ensuring a high intrinsic safety level, an initial inventory compatible with intensive deployment on a worldwide scale, and a not-too-demanding salt chemical reprocessing scheme. The Thorium Molten Salt Reactor (TMSR) thus defined is studied in the Th-(233)U cycle in various configurations obtained by modulating the amount of graphite in core to obtain a thermal, an epithermal, or a fast spectrum. In particular, configurations of a fast spectrum TMSR have been identified with outstanding safety characteristics and minimal fuel-reprocessing requirements.

Neutrons from a Proton-Driven Deuterium Target as a Possible Competitor to Spallation for Nuclear Energy Applications	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article								Measurements are reported on the yield of neutrons from protons in the energy range from 7 to 17 MeV striking a stopping-length target of deuterium gas. This combination of beam and target is being investigated as at? alternative to spallation for accelerator-driven transmutation technology with perhaps equivalent or lower energy cost per neutron. The concept includes neutrons produced from a cascade of reactions starting with the p + d reaction giving rise to subsequent fusion neutrons and neutrons from higher-order breakup reactions. In our application the incident proton energy is expected to be similar to 100 MeV so that most of the neutrons produced in these reactions will be higher-energy neutrons that can undergo multiplication in surrounding beryllium or lead. The results reported here for lower proton energies indicate that the expected fusion and higher-order breakup reactions have been observed, and they provide the basis for a measurement at 100 MeV to confirm the larger proton-induced cascade benefits expected at higher proton energies.

These mirrors will be under the influence of the harsh fusion environment, and in these conditions the mirror material should perform its functions. This article describes experiments that have been carried out to evaluate the prospect of amorphous mirrors retaining their optical characteristics under the impact of deuterium or argon plasma ions of different energy. The experiments were undertaken with the use of mirror samples prepared from amorphous alloys Vitreloy-1 and Vitreloy-4. The data reported demonstrate the principal ability of mirrors made of amorphous materials to preserve the initial optical quality in the process of long-term sputtering, and should be considered as proof of the possibility of using amorphous metal mirrors in the erosion-dominated zone of a fusion reactor.

Surface morphology and radiation damage in sub-surface region have also been examined using scanning electron microscope, atomic force microscope and transmission electron microscope. It is found that the deterioration of the reflectivity under the irradiation with helium ions is very severe and depends on the ion energy, fluence and wavelength. Although fine roughness on the specimen surface was observed in irradiated materials, the size is too tiny to explain the present degradation of the reflectivity by using a Bennett's equation. On the other hand, from the present observation a strong correlation between the deterioration of the reflectivity and the formation of radiation damages in the surface and sub-surface regions of the laser penetration depth is suggested.

The device has a maximal energy input of 3 kJ and is used for both plasma and D-D reaction explorations. Experiments with deuterium have shown that peak current of I(peak) = 39 kA flows between the electrodes at P = 11.5 mbar for the operation voltage of V = 14 kV. An average total neutron yield is measured around 3.3 x 10(5) neutrons per shot using CR-39 plastic detectors located in different places opposite to the anode inside the PF chamber. Neutron anisotropy and pressure-dependent neutron yields are also determined for a series of shots.	[Akgun, Y.; Bolukdemir, A.

RECENT PROGRESS IN PLASMA CONFINEMENT AND HEATING	PROBLEMS OF ATOMIC SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							RELATIVISTIC ELECTRON-BEAM; GOL-3; SUPPRESSION; FACILITY	New results of studies of plasma heating and confinement in the axisymmetric mirror traps are presented. It is shown that due to excitation of the instability at the bounce frequency (bounce instability) the effects of multi-mirror confinement can observed even at the densities by two-three-orders of magnitude lower than those predicted by the Budker, Mirnov and Ryutov theory (GOL-3 facility). This effect makes the multi-mirror reactor more realistic. A small size mirror cell was incorporated with the gas dynamic trap (GDT). Due to the transverse injection of two neutral beams (E-NB=20 keV, W=1 MW) ion hot plasma was obtained in the compact mirror cell. As a result of that the plasma flux to the end wall decreased by 5 times. Besides, the threshold of the Alfven ion cyclotron instability (AIC) was determined in the same experiment with accumulation of fast ions in the compact cell. It follows from this experiment that in the GDT based neutron source the AIC instability will not excite in spite of anisotropic plasma.	[Kruglyakov, E. P.; Burdakov, A. V.; Ivanov, A.

ABOUT OF THE NECESSITY OF THE MODIFICATION OF THE NUCLEAR CHRONOMETRY METHODS IN ASTROPHYSICS AND GEOPHYSICS	PROBLEMS OF ATOMIC SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								In practically all known till now methods of nuclear chronometry there were usually taken into account the life-times of only fundamental states of alpha-radioactive nucleus. But in the processes of nuclear synthesis in stars and under the influence of the constant cosmic radiation on surfaces of planets the excitations of the alpha-radioactive nuclei are going on. Between them there are the states with the excited alpha-particles inside the parent nuclei and so with much smaller life-times. And inside the large masses of stellar, terrestrial and meteoric substances the transitions between different internal conditions of radioactive nuclei are accompanied by infinite chains of the gamma-radiations with the subsequent gamma-absorptions, the further gamma-radiations etc. For the description of the alpha-decay evolution with considering of such excited states and multiple gamma-radiations and gamma-absorptions inside stars and under the influence of the cosmic radiation on the earth surface we present the quantum-mechanical approach, which is based on the generalized Krylov-Fock theorem. Some simple estimations are also presented. They bring to the conclusion that the usual (non-corrected) "nuclear clocks" do really indicate not to realistic values but to the upper limits of the durations of the alpha-decay stellar and planet processes.

RETENTION AND FEATURES OF DEUTERIUM DETRAPPING FROM RADIATION-INDUCED DAMAGES IN STEELS	PROBLEMS OF ATOMIC SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article	IAEA Technical Meeting on Accelerator Simulation and Theoretical Medeling of Radiation Effect	JUN 09-13, 2008	Kharkov Inst Phys & Technol, Natl Res Ctr, Kharkov, UKRAINE	IAEA	Kharkov Inst Phys & Technol, Natl Res Ctr		HELIUM IMPLANTATION; MICROSTRUCTURAL EVOLUTION; STAINLESS-STEEL; HYDROGEN; IRRADIATION; BUBBLES; MIGRATION; BEHAVIOR; ALLOYS; METALS	The accelerators and ion-beam analysis techniques are used for simulation of displacement damage and detailed investigation of distribution profiles of damage and impurity gas atoms (especially helium and hydrogen) in the irradiation of targets for a wide ranges of doses and particle energies. The influence of preimplanted helium and heavy ion-induced damage on deuterium trapping in austenitic and ferritic/martensitic steels was studied. The results obtained for 18Cr10NiTi stainless steel show that ion-implanted deuterium is weakly trapped by defects produced in 5 keV D(+) displacement cascades. The effective trapping temperature interval is between 300 and 600 K. The characteristics of trapping and the temperature range of hydrogen isotopes retention in traps formed by prior implantation of helium depend on the concentration of implanted helium and on the type of defects developed. The formation of helium bubbles in 18Cr10NiTi steel causes an order of magnitude increase in the content of retained deuterium atoms in the range of temperature 300-600 K and extends the interval of effective trapping temperatures to 1000 K. Energetic heavy-ion irradiation (1.4 MeV Ar(+)) has been used for modeling defect cluster formation under displacement cascade conditions to simulate fusion reactor environments. It was found that retention of hydrogen and deuterium strongly increased in this case. It is shown that the presence of a surface-passive film considerably shifts the gas release interval to higher temperatures and reduces the deuterium surface recombination coefficient by several orders of magnitude.

ARGON ACTIVATION IN AIR AT MEDICAL CYCLOTRON RDS ECLIPSE DURING PRODUCTION OF F-18	PROBLEMS OF ATOMIC SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								Medical cyclotrons are widely used to produce positron emitting isotopes for positron emission tomography. High level of air activation is possible due to high neutron flux as a result of O-18(p, n)F-18 reaction. Reaction Ar-40(n, gamma)Ar-41 with radioactive nuclide argon-41 gives main contribution in total activity of air. Value of this activity depends from neutron spectrum and geometry of cyclotron equipment. We considered various approaches for estimation of Ar-41 production and calculated concentration of argon-41 in vault air for cyclotron facility with inner shield containing boron carbide. FLUKA code was used for these calculations.	[Bezshyyko, O. A.; Golinka-Bezshyyko, L. O.; Kadenko, I.

EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF METAL FUEL POINT DEFECT PARAMETERS	PROBLEMS OF ATOMIC SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article	IAEA Technical Meeting on Accelerator Simulation and Theoretical Medeling of Radiation Effect	JUN 09-13, 2008	Kharkov Inst Phys & Technol, Natl Res Ctr, Kharkov, UKRAINE	IAEA	Kharkov Inst Phys & Technol, Natl Res Ctr		PLUTONIUM; IRRADIATION	Nuclear metallic fuels are one of many options for advanced nuclear fuel cycles because they provide dimensional stability, mechanical integrity, thermal efficiency, and irradiation resistance while the associated pyro-processing is technically relevant to concerns about proliferation and diversion of special nuclear materials. In this presentation we will discuss recent success that we have had in studying isochronal annealing of damage cascades in Pu and Pu(Ga) arising from the self-decay of Pu as well as the annealing characteristics of non-interacting point defect populations produced by ion accelerator irradiation. Comparisons of the annealing properties of these two populations of defects arising from very different source terms are enlightening and point to complex defect and mass transport properties in the plutonium specimens which we are only now starting to understand as a result of many follow-on studies. More importantly however, the success of these measurements points the way to obtaining important mass transport parameters for comparison with theoretical predictions or to use directly in existing and future materials modelling of radiation effects in nuclear metallic fuels. The way forward on such measurements and the requisite theory and modelling will be discussed. We bring to the attention of the reader that this article is based wholly or in part on earlier publications of the authors.	[Fluss, M. J.; McCall, S.

A pilot experiment on thermal-neutron fission of (235)U has been conducted. The aim of the experiment was to check the hardware and the information readout computer program. Based on the expressions derived, an analysis was performed and relative yields of delayed neutrons were determined. The present results axe compared to the data obtained by other authors. For further development of the analysis, a question is brought up about the influence of additional conditions on the determination of relative delayed-neutron yields. These additional conditions can be represented by certain expressions laid down when measuring delayed neutron yields directly between the accelerator pulses.	[Buki, A. Yu.; Gokov, S.

All these physical phenomena depend on microstructure changes in irradiated structural materials. The key problem for prolongation of life time of fission atomic reactors and for fusion reactors is to obtain some experimental data about the microstructure changes in structural materials changes at different temperatures at high doses of neutron irradiation and at high level produce displaced atoms. The experimental tests of structural materials in atomic reactors are very expensive and they take long time. The irradiation of these materials by charge fast particle beams on accelerates allow to get such experimental data for physical mechanisms of radiation resistance of them more easy during short time without high radioactivity level on irradiated samples.

THE RADIATION HARDNESS OF n- AND p-Si, DOPED BY OXYGEN AND GERMANIUM, UNDER THE IRRADIATION BY HIGH-ENERGY NUCLEAR PARTICLES	PROBLEMS OF ATOMIC SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			Russian	Article							SILICON	The radiation hardness of n- and p-Si samples grown both by the floating-zone technique and transmutation doped, as well as Si obtained by Czochralski method, were studied after irradiation by fast-pile neutrons of WWR-M reactors under room temperature before and after germanium doped (N(Ge) = 2 . 10(20) CM(-3)). The dependence of the effective concentration of carriers on fluence was described in the framework of Gossick's corrected model. It was found that the introduction of germanium and oxygen enrichment improve the radiation hardness of n-Si in the same way as transmutation doping. The method of increasing of radiation hardness for the semiconductor detectors of nuclear particles was proposed. It was shown that the formation of defect clusters by fast-pile neutrons differs from their formation at irradiation of silicon by 24 GeV protons.	[Dolgolenko, A. P.; Gaidar, G. P.; Varentsov, M.

The possible magnification of a lifetime of devices of structure of nuclear equipments from this class steels is related to radioactive stability of their microstructure in streams of neutrons of high energy. Evolution of properties such steels is related to radioactive dissolution of ODS-particles, change of the dimensional volumetric factor of atoms of these particles in nuclear reactions of transmutations under action of neutrons, introduction of the beaten out atoms from ODS-particles in a matrix of steel and formation of secondary radioactive sinks.

Decommissioning process has to be planned in the safe, ecological and economic manner. it determines the requirements on appropriate evaluation of needed technologies, media, amount of solid materials released into the environment, radioactivity of effluents, amount of radioactive waste for disposal, number and exposure of personnel and finally the financial demands. A detailed evaluation of these parameters may be done by analytical calculation approach. This approach models a real process of decommissioning with its individual basic activities. The methodology of integrated material flow and radioactivity distribution within this calculation evaluation tool is applied and implemented to describe the real decommissioning activities and their mutual relations to obtain more accurate outputs.

Fuel cycle analysis of GFR using advanced fuels	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Advanced fuel cycle; GFR; Synergistic LWR/fast reactor fuel cycles	FISSION; ACTINIDES; YIELDS; PWRS	The potential benefits of a synergistic light-water reactor (LWR) and gas-cooled fast reactor (GFR) fuel cycle were evaluated for its impact on the front-end and back-end of the fuel cycle. Comparisons were made with conventional once-through cycle (OTC) and MOX fuel cycle. Variations in the synergistic LWR/GFR fuel cycles were based on the degree of recycle in the LWR including both plutonium and reprocessed uranium with concomitant impact on used LWR fuel inventory. This provided it wide range in composition of GFR feed from low to high plutonium content with impact on transmutation/incineration within the GFR fuel cycle. Self-recycle of all actinides was modeled for the GFR with analyses demonstrating that the GFR can be sustained on and consequently accept a wide range of feed materials. Analyses were done using Monteburns along with MCNP and Origen2.2 to model it 60-year period corresponding to the anticipated lifetime of supposed contemporary LWRs and GFRs. All cycles were evaluated based on actinide total mass and isotopic inventory. radiotoxicity, heatload, and resource requirements including natural uranium and SWU. For comparison. all fuel cycles were normalized based on 1 TWHe output. Improvements in fuel cycle performance are dictated by the production and incineration of minor actinides in the GFR and their continued recycle may not be feasible due to the buildup of troublesome isotopes such as (244)C in and (252)Cf. But where uranium and plutonium continue to be recycled beyond the 60-year period. the LWR/GFR cycles demonstrated order of magnitude reductions in used fuel inventories, heatload, and radiotoxicity on a per TWHe basis over LWR only cycles. The full details of the advanced fuel cycle methodology and results are presented. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lee, CM; Lee, K; Cho, CH				Lee, Chang-Min; Lee, KunJai; Cho, Cheon-Hyung			Spalling effect on gamma-ray shielding performance in MACSTOR-400 (Korean CANDU spent fuel storage module)	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Dry storage; MACSTOR-400; Spalling effect; Shielding performance; Concrete; Surface dose rate; Shielding margin	CORROSION; CRACKING	The saturation of South Korea's at-reactor (AR) spent fuel storage pools has created a need for additional spent fuel storage capacity. The Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Company is planning to construct a MACSTOR-400 facility composed of reinforced concrete. In concrete structures, cracks occur due to thermal stress, hydration heat, weather, load and other reasons, and shielding performance changes according to the event by crack. However, there are no researches providing the allowable crack for shielding. This paper presents estimating the effect of concrete spalling on gamma-ray shielding performance in MACSTOR-400 based on an FEM simulation. When the cover thickness is under 10 cm. it is estimated that spalling will be formed. Generally, because cover thickness is under 10 cm in the concrete structure, it is estimated that spalling will be formed in MACSTOR-400. If the thickness of wall in MACSTOR-400 is over 100 cm, it is estimated that surface dose rate will be maintained within the radiation safety standards under any conditions related to crack effect. The results of this study may be used for developing standards for radiological safety in shielding structures. especially in relation to the shielding margin. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
