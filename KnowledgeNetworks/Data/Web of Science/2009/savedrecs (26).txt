Rapid separation method for emergency water and urine samples	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							MASS-SPECTROMETRY; ACTINIDES	The Savannah River Site Environmental Bioassay Lab participated in the 2008 NRIP Emergency Response program administered by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) in May, 2008. A new rapid column separation method was used for analysis of actinides and (90)Sr in the NRIP 2008 emergency water and urine samples. Significant method improvements were applied to reduce analytical times. As a result, much faster analysis times were achieved, less than 3 hours for determination of (90)Sr and 3-4 hours for actinides. This represents a 25%-33% improvement in analysis times from NRIP 2007 and a similar to 100% improvement compared to NRIP 2006 report times. Column flow rates were increased by a factor of two, with no significant adverse impact on the method performance. Larger sample aliquots, shorter count times, faster cerium fluoride microprecipitation and streamlined calcium phosphate precipitation were also employed. Based on initial feedback from NIST, the SRS Environmental Bioassay Lab had the most rapid analysis times for actinides and (90)Sr analyses for NRIP 2008 emergency urine samples. High levels of potential matrix interferences may be present in emergency samples and rugged methods are essential. Extremely high levels of (210)Po were found to have an adverse effect on the uranium results for the NRIP-08 urine samples, while uranium results for NRIP-08 water samples were not affected. This problem, which was not observed for NRIP-06 or NRIP-07 urine samples, was resolved by using an enhanced (210)Po removal step, which will be described.	[Maxwell, S. L., III; Culligan, B.

Uranium biosorption under dynamic conditions: Preliminary tests with Sargassum filipendula in real radioactive wastewater containing Ba, Cr, Fe, Mn, Pb, Ca and Mg	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; REMOVAL; BIOMASS; BIOSORBENT	The biosorption of uranium by the seaweed Sargassum filipendula was investigated under dynamic conditions at various bed heights. Our results indicate that a bed height of 40.0 cm (111.9 g biomass) was the most efficient for long-term operation of the continuous system. Our results also indicate that the effluent solutions produced are in accordance with Brazilian legislation for safe discharge of uranium in aqueous streams. The efficiency of the process increased with an increase in bed height from 5.0 to 40.0 cm due to changes in the transfer zone. In treatment of a real effluent contaminated with uranium, stable heavy metals and essential metals, 64% of the uranium was biosorbed, as well as the stable heavy metals chromium, lead and barium. The essential metals calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese were not biosorbed by the seaweed, in fact, their concentrations in the solution increased due to ion-exchange mechanisms with the constituent polysaccharides of the biomass. Another important result was the 85-87% reduction of mass obtained after drying and calcination of the biomass. This is a relevant indication that long-term storage of biomass loaded with radionuclides and heavy metals is possible after concentration of the contaminants. In the present work, the reduction in total mass of the loaded biomass was considerable, thus facilitating storage of the contaminated seaweed.	[Silva, J. I. Rodrigues; Ferreira, A.

Review of relative biological effectiveness dependence on linear energy transfer for low-LET radiations	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Review							ATOMIC-BOMB SURVIVORS; MAMMOGRAPHY X-RAYS; BREAST-CANCER MORTALITY; DOSE-RESPONSE CURVE; HUMAN-LYMPHOCYTES; THYROID-CANCER; CHROMOSOME-ABERRATIONS; GAMMA-RAYS; NEOPLASTIC TRANSFORMATION; IONIZING-RADIATION	Information on Japanese A-bomb survivors exposed to gamma radiation has been used to estimate cancer risks for the whole range of photon (x-rays) and electron energies which are commonly encountered by radiation workers in the work place or by patients and workers in diagnostic radiology. However, there is some uncertainty regarding the radiation effectiveness of various low-linear energy transfer (low-LET) radiations (x-rays, gamma radiation and electrons). In this paper we review information on the effectiveness of low-LET radiations on the basis of epidemiological and in vitro radiobiological studies. Data from various experimental studies for chromosome aberrations and cell transformation in human lymphocytes and from epidemiological studies of the Japanese A-bomb survivors, patients medically exposed to radiation for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and occupational exposures of nuclear workers are considered. On the basis of in vitro cellular radiobiology, there is considerable evidence that the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of high-energy low-LET radiation (gamma radiation, electrons) is less than that of low-energy low-LET radiation (x-rays, betas). This is a factor of about 3 to 4 for 29 kVp x-rays (e. g. as in diagnostic radiation exposures of the female breast) and for tritium beta-rays (encountered in parts of the nuclear industry) relative to Co-60 gamma radiation and 2-5 MeV gamma-rays (as received by the Japanese A-bomb survivors). In epidemiological studies, although for thyroid and breast cancer there appears to be a small tendency for the excess relative risks to decrease as the radiation energy increases for low-LET radiations, it is not statistically feasible to draw any conclusion regarding an underlying dependence of cancer risk on LET for the nominally low-LET radiations.

J	Hunt, J; Bailey, T; Reese, A				Hunt, John; Bailey, Trevor; Reese, Allan			The human body retention time of environmental organically bound tritium	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article								Tritium in the UK environment causes low radiation doses to the public, but uncertainty exists in the dose coefficient for the organically bound component of tritium (OBT). This can affect the assessment of effective doses to representative persons. Contributing to that uncertainty is poor knowledge of the body retention time of OBT and how this varies for different OBT compounds in food. This study was undertaken to measure the retention time of tritium by volunteers after eating sole from Cardiff Bay, which may contain OBT from discharges from the GE Healthcare Ltd plant. Five volunteers provided samples of excreta over periods up to 150 days after intake. The results, which are presented in raw form to allow independent analysis, suggest retention of total tritium with body half-times ranging from 4 to 11 days, with no evidence (subject to experimental noise) of a significant contribution due to retention with a longer half-time. This range covers the half-time of 10 days used by the ICRP for tritiated water. The short timescale could be due to rapid hydrolysis in body tissues of the particular form of OBT used in this study. Implications for the dose coefficient for OBT are that the use of the ICRP value of 4.2 x 10(-11) Sv Bq(-1) may be cautious in this specific situation. These observations on dose coefficients are separate from any implications of recent discussion on whether the tritium radiation weighting factor should be increased from 1 to 2.

Assessment of natural radioactivity of sand used in Turkey	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article							MASS ATTENUATION COEFFICIENTS; BUILDING-MATERIALS; RADON EXHALATION; BY-PRODUCTS; BANGLADESH; ENERGY	The natural radioactivity due to the presence of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 in sand samples used as building materials in Turkey was measured by gamma spectrometry. The measured activity in the sand samples ranged from 17 to 97 Bq kg(-1), 10 to 133 Bq kg(-1) and 116 to 955 Bq kg(-1) for Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40, respectively. The concentrations of these natural radionuclides were compared with the reported data for other countries. The radium equivalent activity (Ra-eq), the external hazard index (H-ex), the internal hazard index (H-in), the indoor absorbed dose rate in air and the annual effective dose rate were evaluated to assess the radiation hazard for people living in dwellings made of the materials studied. The Raeq values of sand samples are lower than the limit of 370 Bq kg(-1), equivalent to a gamma dose of 1.5 mSv yr(-1). This study shows that the measured sand samples do not pose any significant source of radiation hazard and are safe for use in building materials. Moreover, the experimental mass attenuation coefficients (mu/rho) of seven different sand samples were determined in the energy range 80-1332 keV photons by using the gamma ray transmission method. Experimental values of mass attenuation coefficient were compared with theoretical values obtained using the program XCOM. The calculated values and the experimental results of this work and the other results in the literature are found to be in good agreement. Chemical and structural analyses (XRD) of the sand samples were also undertaken.	[Cevik, U.; Damla, N.; Kobya, A.

J	Turhan, S				Turhan, Seref			Radiological impacts of the usability of clay and kaolin as raw material in manufacturing of structural building materials in Turkey	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article							NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; RADON EXHALATION; BY-PRODUCTS; HAZARDS; SAMPLES; BRICKS; EGYPT; DWELLINGS; CONCRETE; PAKISTAN	The aim of the present study is to measure the natural radioactivity due to the presence of radionuclides in clay and kaolin, used widely as raw materials in ceramics, bricks and cement industries, and to assess the possible radiological hazards associated with these raw materials. The activity concentrations of natural radionuclides (226)Ra, (232)Th and (40)K in 50 samples collected from different quarries were measured by means of gamma-ray spectrometry with an HPGe detector. The mean values of the measured activity concentrations of (226)Ra, (232)Th and (40)K for clay samples were found to be 39.3 +/- 22.7 Bq kg(-1), 49.6 +/- 27.9 Bq kg(-1) and 569.5 +/- 181.0 Bq kg(-1), and for kaolin samples 82.0 +/- 37.3 Bq kg(-1), 94.8 +/- 49.2 Bq kg(-1) and 463.6 +/- 544.9 Bq kg(-1), respectively. These levels are comparable to those appearing in clays of European countries. The radium equivalent activity and the external (gamma) and internal (alpha) hazard indices were calculated to assess the potential radiological hazard. The calculated gamma and alpha indices varied from 0.19 to 1.17 and from 0.04 to 0.47 for clay samples and from 0.36 to 1.75 and from 0.08 to 0.63, respectively. The mean value of the gamma index for the clay samples (0.57 +/- 0.24) is slightly above the criterion of 0.5 corresponding to an annual effective dose of 0.3 mSv, while the mean value of the gamma index for the kaolin samples (0.90 +/- 0.49) is below the criterion of unity corresponding to an annual effective dose of 1 mSv. The calculated alpha index values for all samples are below the recommended upper level.

Radiological safety assessment of surface-water dam sediments used as building material in southwestern Nigeria	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article							NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; RADIATION HAZARDS; BY-PRODUCTS; RADIONUCLIDES; EGYPT; DISTRICTS; PAKISTAN; SAMPLES	Gamma-ray spectrometric measurements were performed on sediment samples collected from surface-water dams in five southwestern states of Nigeria with the aim of estimating the background radiation levels and assessing the radiological hazards associated with the use of sediments in building construction. The weighted mean concentration of (40)K varied from 199.1 to 796.7 Bq kg(-1), whereas that of (238)U varied from 22.6 to 27.6 Bq kg(-1) and that of (232)Th varied from 36.4 to 76.1 Bq kg(-1) in the five states where samples were collected. The radiological hazards due to the natural radioactivity in samples were inferred from calculations of radium equivalent activities, internal and external indices, and effective dose rates in indoor air. The values obtained are lower than internationally recommended limits for building materials. The results indicate an acceptably low radiological risk arising from the use of the sediments in the construction of buildings.	[Farai, I.

Natural radioactive nuclides and chemical components in the groundwater of Beni Suef Governate, Middle Egypt	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article							RADIONUCLIDES	Measurements of natural radioactivity in drinking water have been performed in many parts of the world, mostly for assessment of the doses and risk resulting from consuming water. A study of the radionuclide and chemical components in groundwater from Beni Suef Governate, Egypt has been carried out. Fifty water samples were analysed by gamma-ray spectroscopy to determine the (226)Ra, (232)Th and (40)K concentrations; major elements, pH, alkalinity and conductivity were also measured. The activity concentration values ranged from 0.008 to 0.040 Bq 1(-1) for (226)Ra, from 0.003 to 0.019 Bq 1(-1) for (232)Th and from 0.025 to 0.344 Bq 1(-1) for (40)K. The annual ingestion of these radionuclides, using local consumption rates (averaged over the whole population) of 1.5 1 d(-1), was estimated to be 8.59, 4.86 and 83.47 Bq y(-1) for (226)Ra, (232)Th and (40)K, respectively. The estimated effective doses from drinking water were found to be 2.4 mu Sv y(-1) ((226)Ra), 1.1 mu Sv y(-1) ((232)Th) and 0.5 mu Sv y(-1) ((40)K). The contribution of these radionuclides to the committed effective dose from a year's consumption of drinking water is therefore estimated to be only 4% of the WHO value (0.1 mSv y(-1)). The moderate pH value is the most important parameter, and there was no observed correlation between natural radioactivity and electrical conductivity or concentrations of major ions.

Analysis has been performed with 20% enriched (235)U target bearing plate type aluminized fuel (U-AI). Target (target holder and fuel plates) design contains three fuel plates and two aluminum dummy plates. Neutronic calculations were carried out for core at the beginning of equilibrium cycle of Pakistan Research Reactor-1 (PARR-1). Target analysis was performed by irradiating it at a location of maximum thermal flux available in the core. For this purpose, irradiation was performed at five different axial planes of the central water box facility. Thermal neutron flux profiles were also studied at different axial positions in available irradiation locations. Computer code WIMSD/4, a transport theory lattice code was employed for the generation of 10 group microscopic cross-sections. Diffusion theory code CITATION was utilized for three-dimensional modeling of the core. It was observed that from reactivity point ofview, insertion or removal of target from the core will not affect the safety of reactor. Maximum heat flux in the target would be 102.68 W/cm(2) which is below the point of onset of nucleate boiling. However, forced flow is required to avoid initiation of nucleate boiling. The computer code ORIGEN2 was employed for depletion calculations. Analysis was performed for 100 Ci activity of (99)Mo. After 100 days decay, waste activity will be less than 1 Ci and it will not pose any problem for handling radioactive waste. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Post-irradiation examination of high burnup UO2 pellets show an increase in the fission-gas release rate, an increase in fuel swelling, and formation of fission-gas bubbles throughout the pellets. Xenon abundances were quantified, and phenomena leading to this bubble formation were identified. All examinations provided valuable data on the complex state of the fuel during irradiation. They show the good behavior of these fuels, exhibiting various microstructures at very high burnups, none of which is likely to lead to problems during irradiation.

This research has been done by the CSN, ENRESA, and ENUSA in order to investigate the behavior of advanced cladding materials in contemporary PWRs at higher burnup under dry cask storage conditions. Also, to investigate the hydride reorientation, the cool-down of the samples after the test has been done in a coordinated manner with the internal pressure. The creep results obtained are consistent with the expected behavior from reference CWSR material, Zr-4. During the test, the material retained significant ductility: one specimen leaked during the test at an engineering strain of the tube section of 17%; remarkably, the crack closed due to de-pressurization. Although significant hydride reorientation occurred during the cool-down under pressure, no specimen failed during the cool-down.

Two of the ramp tests are of staircase type up to Linear Heat Rates of 420 and 520 W/cm and with long holding periods. Failure of the 420 W/cm fuel rod was observed after 40 minutes. The third ramp test consisted of a more standard ramp test with a constant power rate of 80 W/cm/min up to 410 W/cm with a short holding time. The tests were first simulated with the METEOR ID fuel rod code, which gave accurate results ill terms of profilometry and fission gas releases. The behaviour of a fuel pellet fragment and of the cladding piece on top of it was then investigated with ALCYONE 3D. The size and the main characteristics of the ridges after base irradiation and power ramp testing were recovered. Finally, the failure criteria validated for PWR conditions and fuel rods with low-to-medium bum-ups were used to analyze the failure probability of the KKL rodlets during ramp testing.

Increasing progressively the fuel discharge burn-up in PWR power plants, this material transformation was again observed in 1985 and identified as an important process to be accounted for in the fuel simulations due to its expected consequence on fuel heat transfer and therefore on the fission gas release. Fission gas release was one of the major concerns in PWR fuels, mainly during transient or accidents events. The behaviour of such a material in case of rod failure was also an important aspect to analyse. Therefore several national and international programs were launched during the last 25 years to understand the mechanisms leading to the high burn-up structure formation and to evaluate the physical properties of the final material. A large observations database has been acquired, using the more sophisticated techniques available in hot cells. This large database is discussed in this paper, providing basis to build an engineering-model, which is based on phenomenological description data and information accumulated. In addition this paper has the ambition to construct the best logical model to understand restructuring.

Investigations for the use of the fast digitizers with C6D6 detectors for radiative capture measurements at GELINA	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Fast digitizer; C6D6 detectors; Time-of-flight; Radiative capture measurements	LIQUID SCINTILLATION DETECTORS; PULSE-SHAPE ANALYSIS; CROSS-SECTION; NEUTRON	The relatively long dead time in conventional data acquisition systems that provide simultaneously the pulse height and the time information for the detected events hinders cross-section measurements with high count rates. This is the case for capture cross-section measurements at the time-of-flight facility GELINA using high radioactive samples or thick samples of materials having strong resonances. Either the high average count rate (e.g. due to the radioactivity of the sample) or the high instantaneous count rate for strong resonances results in a large dead time correction. One solution to reduce the impact of the dead time is the use of a data acquisition system based on fast digitizers. The performances of two commercial digitizers (CAEN N172B and Acqiris DC282), coupled to a C6D6 scintillator, have been tested in terms of pulse height linearity and resolution, dead time and time resolution. The signal processing was done on-line obtaining simultaneously the pulse height and time information for each detected event. With both digitizers a comparable pulse height linearity and resolution has been obtained as with a conventional system. The total dead time of both digital systems is at least a factor 5 shorter than the one for the conventional system. The main difference in performance between the two digitizers is the time resolution. For a relatively large scintillator, a time resolution of about 2 ns has been achieved with the DC282 module and the conventional system while the time resolution was limited to 15 ns with the CAEN N1728B module. For most nuclei a 15ns time resolution is sufficient to perform resonance shape analysis. Therefore, the CAEN N1728B module can be used for the majority of capture cross-section measurements at GELINA. However, for nuclei with low level density, for which the resolved resonance region extends to the keV-region, a better time resolution is required and the Acqiris DC282 module has to be used.

An ultrahigh resolution SPECT system for I-125 mouse brain imaging studies	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Single photon emission microscope; T cell tracking	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; ELECTRON-MULTIPLYING CCD; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; GAMMA-CAMERA; DETECTOR; THERAPY; COLITIS; DESIGN; TUMORS	This paper presents some initial experimental results obtained with a dual-head prototype single photon emission microscope system (SPEM) that is dedicated to mouse brain studies using I-125 labeled radiotracers. In particular, this system will be used for in vivo tacking of radiolabeled T cells in mouse brain. This system is based on the use of the intensified electron multiplying charge-coupled device (I-EMCCD) camera that offers the combination of an excellent intrinsic spatial resolution, a good signal-to-noise ratio, a large active area and a reasonable detection efficiency over an energy range between 27-140keV. In this study, the dual-head SPEM system was evaluated using both resolution phantoms and a mouse with locally injected T cells labeled with I-125. It was demonstrated that for a relatively concentrated source object, the current dual-head SPEM system is capable of visualizing the tiny amount of radioactivity (similar to 12 nCi) carried by a very small number ( < 1000) of T cells. The current SPEM system design allows four or six camera heads to be installed in a stationary system configuration that offers a doubled or tripled sensitivity at a spatial resolution similar to that obtained with the dual-head system. This development would provide a powerful tool for in vivo and non-invasive tracking of radiolabeled T cells in mouse brain and potentially for other rodent brain imaging studies.

Sensitivity of in-situ gamma-ray spectra to soil density and water content	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Gamma-radiation; Sediment; Monte-Carlo simulations; (40)K; (232)Th; (238)U; (137)Cs	RADIOACTIVE PARTICLES OFFSHORE; MONTE-CARLO ASSESSMENT; NATURAL RADIONUCLIDES; SPECTROMETRY; DETECTOR; EROSION; FIELDS; AIR	The effects of sediment water content and bulk density on measurements of in-situ environmental gamma-radiation were investigated using Monte-Carlo simulations. The simulations consider a large bismuth-germanate detector in a semi-infinite geometry. The volume contributing radiation to the detector decreases with increasing sediment bulk density, as the detector sees' a constant sediment mass. The effect of variations in porosity on gamma-ray spectra is negligible. Variations in water content affect the shape of the spectra only in the region below 0.1 MeV and, more importantly, strongly affect spectral intensity. Separate measurements of sediment water content, when expressed as mass fraction of water, can be used to correct spectra collected on sediments with varying water content. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

First measurements are presented for direct or cumulative production of Nd-141, Nd-140, Nd-139m, Pr-142, Ce-139, Ce-137m and La-140. Thick target yields and practical batch activity are derived from the fitted excitation curves for the medically relevant Nd-140 and Pr-139 (as decay product of Nd-139m). For reactions on Tm targets previous published results up to 20 MeV are extended and confirmed up to 40 MeV for Yb-169, Tm-167,Tm-168 while high energy values are presented for the first time for Yb-166. Values for the thick target yield (TTY) of Yb-169 production are derived and the discussion of different production routes is in agreement with previous published results. A comparison of experimental values with different model codes shows that the upgraded versions of the ALICE and EMPIRE codes can give a better description of (d,pxn) reaction than older ones.

Cs-137 source dose distribution using the Fricke Xylenol Gel dosimetry	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						FXG; Spatial dose distribution; Brachytherapy; Cs-137	PARAMETERS	Dosimetric measurements close to radioisotope sources, such as those used in brachytherapy, require high spatial resolution to avoid incorrect results in the steep dose gradient region. In this work the Fricke Xylenol Gel dosimeter was used to obtain the spatial dose distribution. The readings from a Cs-137 source were performed using two methods, visible spectrophotometer and CCD camera images. Good agreement with the Sievert summation method was found for the transversal axis dose profile within uncertainties of 4% and 5%, for the spectrophotometer and CCD camera respectively. Our results show that the dosimeter is adequate for brachytherapy dosimetry and, owing to its relatively fast and easy preparation and reading, it is recommended for quality control in brachytherapy applications.

The mechanism is driven by bombardment of fission energy fragments and studies were conducted by combining accelerator based experiments and computer-science. Specimen of CeO2 was used as simulation material of fuel ceramics. With swift heavy ion (Xe) irradiation on CeO2, with 210 MeV, change of valence charge and lattice deviation of cations were observed by XPS and XRD. Combined irradiations of Xe implantation and swift heavy ion irradiation successfully produced sub-micrometer sized sub-grains, similar as that observed in commercial fuels. Studying components of mechanism scenarios, with first principle calculations using the VASP code, we found stable hyper-stoichiometric defect structures of UO2+x. Molecular dynamics studies revealed stability of Xe planar defects and also found rapid transport mode of oxygen-vacancy clusters. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Oxygen defects created in CeO2 irradiated with 200 MeV Au ions	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th Triennial International Symposium on Swift Heavy Ions in Matter	JUN 02-05, 2008	Lyon, FRANCE			High-energy ion irradiation; Electronic energy deposition; Radiation damage; Oxygen vacancy; Raman spectroscopy; Thermal annealing	HIGH-ENERGY IONS; TRACK FORMATION; X-RAY; FUEL; UO2	CeO2 films were irradiated with 200 MeV An ions in order to investigate the damages created by electronic energy deposition. In the Raman spectra of the ion-irradiated films, a broad band appears at the higher frequency side of the F-2g peak of CeO2. The band intensity increases as ion fluence increases. Furthermore, the F-2g peak becomes asymmetric with a low-frequency tail. In order to understand the origin of these spectral changes, all unirradiated CeO2 film was annealed in vacuum at 1000 degrees C. By comparing the results for the irradiation and for the annealing, it is concluded that the broad band obtained for irradiated samples contains the peak observed for the annealed sample. The F-2g peak becomes asymmetric with a low-frequency tail by the irradiation as well as the annealing. Therefore, the above-mentioned changes in the Raman spectra caused by 200 MeV Au irradiation is closely related to the creation of oxygen vacancies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Golyand, L; Shwageraus, E; Ronen, Y				Golyand, Leonid; Shwageraus, Eugene; Ronen, Yigal			Effect of Am-241(95)(n,gamma) Reaction Branching Ratio on Fuel Cycle and Reactor Design Characteristics	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							NUCLEAR BATTERY; CODE; AM-242M	The growing interest in innovative reactors and advanced fuel cycle designs requires more accurate prediction of various transuranic actinide concentrations during irradiation or following discharge because of their effect on reactivity or spent-fuel emissions, such as gamina and neutron activity and decay heat. In this respect, many of the important actinides originate from the Am-241(n,gamma) reaction, which leads to either the ground or the metastable state of Am-242. The branching ratio for this reaction depends on the incident neutron energy and has very large uncertainty in the current evaluated nuclear data files. This study examines the effect of accounting for the energy dependence of the Am-241(n,gamma) reaction branching ratio calculated from different evaluated data files for different reactor and fuel types on the reactivity and concentrations of some important actinides. The results of the study confirm that the uncertainty in knowing the Am-241(n,gamma) reaction branching ratio has a negligible effect on the characteristics of conventional light water reactor fuel. However in advanced reactors with large loadings of actinides in general, and Am-241 in particular, the branching ratio data calculated from the different data files may lead to significant differences in the prediction of the fuel criticality, and isotopic composition. Moreover, it was found that neutron energy spectrum weighting of the branching ratio in each analyzed case is particularly important and May result in up to a factor of 2 difference in the branching ratio value. Currently most of the neutronic codes have a single branching ratio value in their data libraries, which is sometimes difficult or impossible to update in accordance with the neutron spectrum shape for the analyzed system.

Measurements were performed with both polyethylene and acrylic reflectors. For each reflector type, five different reflector thicknesses were investigated: 0 (bare), 1.27, 2.54, 3.81, and 7.62 cm. A certain ratio of spectral quantities that depends on the fluctuations in the fission chain multiplication process was measured for each configuration. In addition, two types of Monte Carlo calculations were employed to estimate the k(eff) and spectral ratio values of each configuration. From the measured and computed quantities, the multiplication and uncertainty of the system can be inferred. The polyethylene measurements compared well to previous measurements conducted with the same plutonium sphere and polyethylene reflector thicknesses. The acrylic measurements provide benchmark data of an alpha-phase plutonium sphere reflected by acrylic.

The advanced burner reactor (ABR) is a fast reactor concept which supports the GNEP fuel cycle system. Since the integralfast reactor (IFR) and advanced liquid-metal reactor (ALMR) projects were terminated in 1994, there has been no major development on sodium-cooled fist reactors in the United States. Therefore, in support of the GNEP fast reactor program, the history of sodium-cooled reactor development was reviewed to support the initiation of this technology within the United States and to gain an understanding of the technology gaps that may still remain for sodium fast reactor technology. The fuel-handling system is a key element of any fast reactor design. The major functions of this system are to receive, test, store, and then load fresh fuel into the core; unload from the core; then clean, test, store, and ship spent fuel. Major requirements are that the system must be reliable and relatively easy to maintain. In addition, the system should be designed so that it does not adversely impact plant economics from the viewpoints of capital investment or plant operations. In this gap analysis, information on fuel-handling operating experiences in the following reactor plants was carefully reviewed: EBR-I, SRE, HNPF, Fermi, SEFOR, FFTF, CRBR, EBR-II, DFR, PFR, Rapsodie, Phenix, Superphinix, KNK, SNR-300, Joyo, and Monju. The results of this evaluation indicate that a standardized fuel-handling system for a commercial fast reactor is yet to be established. However, in the past sodium-cooled reactor plants, most major fuel-handling components-such as the rotatable plug, in-vessel fuel-handling machine, ex-vessel fivel transportation cask, ex-vessel sodium-cooled storage, and cleaning stations-have accumulated satisfactory construction and operation experiences. In addition, two special issues for future development are described in this report: large capacity interim storage and transuranic-bearing fuel handling.

THE ASTEC INTEGRAL CODE FOR SEVERE ACCIDENT SIMULATION	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						severe accidents; ASTEC; nuclear safety	PHEBUS FP; VALIDATION	For several years the French Institut de Radioprotection et de Surete Nucleaire (IRSN) and the German Gesellychaft fur Anlagen und Reaktorsicherheit (GRS) mbH have been jointly developing a system of calculation codes-the integral Accident Source Term Evaluation Code (ASTEC)-to simulate the complete scenario of a hypothetical severe accident in a nuclear light water reactor, from the initial event until the possible radiological release of fission products out of the containment, i.e., the source term. ASTEC has progressively reached a larger European dimension through projects of the European Commission Framework Programme. In particular, in the frame of the European Severe Accident Research NET work of Excellence (SARNET), jointly executed research activities were performed with the ultimate objectives of providing physical models for integration into ASTEC and making the code the European reference. This effort will go on in the frame of the SARNET2 next network. The ASTEC models are today at the state of the art, except for reflooding of a degraded core. Many applications have been performed by IRSN for significant safety studies, including the probabilistic safety analysis level 2 on a French pressurized water reactor. The first version V2. 0 of the new ASTEC series, released in spring 2009, will allow simulation of the European Pressurized Reactor (EPR) and will include advanced core degradation models. Then, ASTEC will remain the repository of knowledge gained from international research and development. Other long-term objectives are on one hand extension of the scope of application to boiling water reactors and CANada Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) reactors, to accidents in the ITER Fusion facility, and to Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) Generation IV reactors, and on the other hand to the use for emergency response tools and for severe accident simulators.

TOWARD AN ATOMISTICALLY INFORMED FUEL PERFORMANCE CODE: THERMAL PROPERTIES USING FRAPCON AND MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATION	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						pellet thermal expansion; pellet thermal conductivity; FRAPCON	URANIUM-DIOXIDE; CONDUCTIVITY	A proof-of-principle study is presented in which the results of atomic-level simulations of the thermal expansion and thermal conductivity Of UO(2) are integrated into the fuel performance code FRAPCON. The beginning of-life (BOL) thermal conductivity profile of a fuel pellet and the evolution of the pellet expansion over its lifetime are determined It is found that (a) modifying FRAPCON to accept input from atomistic simulations (or elsewhere, such as new experiments or other calculations) is relatively straightforward, at least for these two properties, and (b) the properties determined from atomistic simulations yield predictions in FRAPCON that are in good agreement for the BOL thermal conductivity, but much less satisfactory for the pellet expansion.

J	Chikazawa, Y; Grandy, C				Chikazawa, Yoshitaka; Grandy, Christopher			THERMAL ANALYSIS OF A FUEL-HANDLING SYSTEM FOR SODIUM-COOLED REACTOR WITH MINOR ACTINIDE-BEARING METAL FUEL	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						sodium-cooled reactor; fuel handling; fresh fuel shipping cask	VAULT DRY STORAGE; FORT-ST-VRAIN	The Advanced Burner Reactor (ABR) is one of the components of the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) used to close the fuel cycle. ABR is a sodium-cooled fast reactor that is used to consume transuranic elements resulting from the reprocessing of light water reactor spent nuclear fuel. ABR-1000 [1000 MW(thermal)] is a fast reactor concept created at Argonne National Laboratory to be used as a reference concept for various future trade-offs. ABR-1000 meets the GNEP goals although it uses what is considered base sodium fast reactor technology for its systems and components. One of the considerations of any fast reactor plant concept is the ability to perform fuel-handling operations with new and spent fast reactorfuel. The transmutation fuel proposed as the ABR fuel has a very little experience base, and thus, this paper investigates afuel-handling concept and potential issues of handling fast reactorfuel containing minor actinides. In this study, two thermal analyses supporting a conceptual design study on the ABR-1000 fuel-handling system were carried out. One analysis investigated passive dry spent fuel storage, and the other analysis investigated a fresh fuel shipping cask. Passive dry storage can be made suitable for the ABR-1000 spent	[Chikazawa, Yoshitaka; Grandy, Christopher] Argonne Natl Lab, Nucl Engn Div, Argonne, IL 60439 USA	Chikazawa, Y (reprint author), Japan Atom Energy Agcy, 4002 Narita, Oarai, Ibaraki 3111393, Japan.	chikazawa.yoshitaka@jaea.go.jp			U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science [DE-AC02-06CH11357]	The submitted manuscript has been created by UChicago Argonne, LLC, operator of ANL.

REMOVING ACETIC ACID FROM A UREX plus WASTE STREAM: A REVIEW OF TECHNOLOGIES	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						acetic acid removal; UREX; separation technologies	ACTIVATED CARBON; AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; CARBOXYLIC-ACIDS; WATER; SOLVENT; ADSORPTION; OXIDATION; RECOVERY; ADSORBENTS; SEPARATION	This study explores different technologies for removing acetic acid from a UREX+ waste stream. The waste stream contains both nitric and acetic acids, and the acetic acid must be removed from the waste stream to prevent potential problems in the downstream steps as well as affecting the recycle of nitric acid. The acetic acid is formed after the UREX step of the process as a result of hydrolytic degradation of acetohydroxamic acid used to suppress plutonium extraction. Of the available technologies, the two most attractive approaches are solvent extraction and distillation. In industry, solvent extraction is used for more dilute concentrations of acetic acid while distillation is used for concentrated acetic acid If a liquid-liquid extraction is viable, this would be the best option with the addition of an extractant, like tributyl phosphate or tri-n-octyl amine, if needed However, if acetic acid removal can be delayed until the end of the UREX+ process when the nitric acid may be concentrated for recycle, distillation may remain an option, though not necessarily a better option than solvent extraction.

ASSESSMENT OF A HIGH-THROUGHPUT ELECTROREFINING CONCEPT FOR A SPENT METALLIC NUCLEAR FUEL-II: ELECTROHYDRODYNAMIC ANALYSIS AND VALIDATION	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						electrorefining; spent fuel; high throughput	ELECTRODEPOSITION CHARACTERISTICS; URANIUM; GRAPHITE; CATHODE	Assessment of a high-throughput electrorefiner for a spent metallic fuel was carried out by using a commercial computational fluid dynamics code, CFX, and its performance was validated experimentally with a surrogate material. An electrorefiner equipped with a graphite cathode bundle was designed to continuously recover a high-purity uranium product without a noble metal contamination. The performance of the process for a decontamination of a noble metal in a uranium product was evaluated numerically as a function of the process parameters such as the rotation speed of the stirrer and the anode basket, and was validated experimentally. The distributions of the electric field and the electrodeposition behavior were also evaluated numerically, and an optimum electrode configuration was suggested.

Spent fuel rod splitting due to UO2 oxidation during dry storage: Assessment of the database	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Review						Rod splitting; UO2 oxidation; Dry storage	AIR; BEHAVIOR; 250-DEGREES-C	Dry interim storage is becoming a common practice worldwide. The potential contact between "undamaged" (i.e., not detected as damaged, but containing tiny defects like pinholes and hairline cracks) fuel rods and an oxidizing atmosphere during the cask water removal might lead to unacceptable consequences. One way to prevent it is to determine the time to propagation of a defect at given conditions. This paper compiles and critically reviews the existing database concerning time-at-temperature profile of fuel rods containing tiny defects (i.e., pinholes and hairline cracks) that are exposed to oxidizing atmospheres. Temperature and burnup have been identified as the main variables influencing the incubation time under the conditions explored by the experiments carried out. By correlating all the experimental data gathered, an empirical correlation of an Arrhenius-type has been derived that encapsulates the temperature and burnup effects in a satisfactory way (i.e., relative error less than 36% and R-2 = 0.87). Additionally, the sensitivity of time-to-propagation to changes in both variables has been investigated. The major database weaknesses are data scarcity and test boundary conditions far away from the ones shown by the spent fuel discharged from reactors nowadays (i.e., too low burnup or unlimited flow of oxidizing agent). Based on them, a proposal for further investigation is proposed to make time-at-temperature profiles a sound and reliable tool to assess the effect of potential fuel oxidation on "undamaged" fuel rods integrity.

The resultant solid waste was blended by extrusion with virgin and recycled low density polyethylene (LDPE) at 30 and 50 wt% load. Samples were evaluate to homogeneity by density determinations (ASTM D792-91), compressive strength (ASTM D695-91) and leaching behavior by accelerated leaching tests (ASTM C1308-95). Coefficient of variation of density was lower than 5% for all evaluated waste forms, indicating a satisfactory homogeneity. Compressive strengths have complied to U.S.NRC standard and were above CNEN standard limit for cement waste products if 5% strain could be considered a reasonable limit to assure the structural integrity of the material. Cumulated fraction leached after 11 days of accelerated leach test was found to be lower than 10%, and diffusion coefficients of boron have varied between 3.86 x 10(-10) and 9.06 x 10(-10) cm(2)/s. Boron concentrations for all materials have shown a tendency to reach an asymptotic value at the end of the test (around 0.25 and 0.7 mg/L for 30 and 50% waste load, respectively). Measured cumulated fraction leached(CFL) data with time have shown a tendency of becoming asymptotic sooner than it was predicted by the diffusion model. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The total dose of irradiation was up to 523 kGy. Degradation nature was tested by studying the changes in mechanical and thermal properties with rate and total dose of irradiation. Ultimate tensile strength and toughness first increased and then decreased with total irradiation dose. Half value dose (HVD) for elongation was 148 kGy and it was 178 kGy for tensile strength at the dose rate of 1485 Gy/h. Half value dose was found from the extrapolation of experimental data as 228 kGy for elongation and 205 kGy for tensile strength at the dose rate of 82.8 Gy/h. The FTIR spectral analysis showed depolymerization degradation of polymer with irradiation. It was concluded from experimental results that PMMA can be used for embedding radioactive wastes.

A study on a scenario using the PID method	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						PID; RES; Reference scenario; Scenario evolution		A scenario, a broad-brush description of a possible future evolution of a system, can be specified in terms of a set of FEPs (Features, Events and Processes) and their interactions. KAERI has developed a scenario using the PID (Process Influence Diagram) method to reveal the interactions between processes in detail. For the development of PID, KAERI established a methodology of four principles based on the KAERI RES (Rock Engineering System). According to the methodology, a model PID of a reference scenario is under development and three sub-PIDs of a container corrosion, a mechanical stress change and a radionuclide migration sub-scenario have been constructed. Also, a main frame for a full PID has been integrated using two sub-PIDs such as a container corrosion sub-scenario and a mechanical stress change sub-scenario. After constructing the full PID of a reference scenario, the other PIDs will be constructed in a similar manner to the model PID. In addition, various reduced PIDs as well as a full PID will be provided to meet a user's requirements. Realization of the scenario using RES and PID is expected to increase the confidence and the transparency for a safety assessment of a high-radioactive waste repository. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Streeper, C; Whitworth, J; Tompkins, JA				Streeper, Charles; Whitworth, Julia; Tompkins, J. Andrew			Lack of international consensus on the disposition and storage of disused sealed sources	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								A lower-activity analogue of the trans-national problem of spent fuel management and disposal is the global problem of radioactive sealed source [source: The IAEA definition of a sealed source is "Radioactive material that is permanently sealed in a capsule or closely bonded and in a solid form." Taken from glossary of Nuclear Waste Data Management found at http://www-ewmdb.iaea.org/showhelp. asp?Topic=8-1-1.] disposal. Sources are found in almost every country in the world because of their beneficial medical and commercial or industrial applications. Some of the isotopes used have short half-lives-iridium-192 (Ir-192), 73.8 days-while others have very long half-lives-americium-241 (Am-241), 432 years or plutonium-239 (Pu-239), 24,130 years. It is critically important, particularly for longer-lived isotopes, to find final disposition pathways. Lack of a permanent disposition pathway such as recycling or irretrievable disposal creates numerous problems, including the potential loss of regulatory control, which increases the risk of inadvertent or deliberate misuse of the material. The misuse of radioactive materials has the potential for substantial public health and economic damage. Disused sources also pose an inherent risk to the end-users from a liability, safety, and public health perspectives. This paper examines various disposition pathways employed by several key source manufacturing or possessing nation-states for disused sources. Examples of source disposition pathways include long-term storage, deep geological disposal, borehole disposal and shallow land burial. The Off-Site Source Recovery Project (OSRP), part of the office of Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI), acts as an intermediary in the recovery and ultimate disposition of US origin sealed radiological materials. Several concepts that could help mitigate the challenge of a lack of long-term disposition options for sources are available, but these tools have not yet been applied by most nation-states. For example, regional consolidation and repatriation of sources to the country of manufacture would ease or eliminate the need for in situ disposal or storage in a number of developing nation-states.

J	Talamo, A				Talamo, Alberto			A novel concept of QUADRISO particles - Part III: Applications to the plutonium-thorium fuel cycle	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Thorium; MCB; QUADRISO; GT-MHR		In the present study, a plutonium-thorium fuel cycle is investigated including the (233)U production and utilization. A prismatic thermal High Temperature Gas Reactor (HTGR) and the novel concept of quadruple isotropic (QUADRISO) coated particles, designed at the Argonne National Laboratory, have been used for the study. In absorbing QUADRISO particles, a burnable poison layer surrounds the central fuel kernel to flatten the reactivity curve as a function of time. At the beginning of life, the fuel in the QUADRISO particles is hidden from neutrons, since they get absorbed in the burnable poison before they reach the fuel kernel. Only when the burnable poison depletes, neutrons start streaming into the fuel kernel inducing fission reactions and compensating the fuel depletion of ordinary TRISO particles. In fertile QUADRISO particles, the absorber layer is replaced by natural thorium with the purpose of flattening the excess of reactivity by the thorium resonances and producing (233)U. The above configuration has been compared with a configuration where fissile (neptunium-plutonium oxide from Light Water Reactors irradiated fuel) and fertile (natural thorium oxide) fuels are homogeneously mixed in the kernel of ordinary TRISO particles. For the (233)U utilization, the core has been equipped with europium oxide absorbing QUADRISO particles. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Rogers, KA				Rogers, Kenneth A.			Fire in the hole: A review of national spent nuclear fuel disposal policy	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Geologic disposal; Highly radioactive waste; National nuclear waste disposal; Spent nuclear fuel		Today, nuclear power plants operate in 31 countries and account for approximately 15% of the world's electricity production. Moreover, a number of additional reactors are expected to come on-line over the next several years as a result of a global resurgence in nuclear power. Since the amount of spent nuclear fuel generated by these plants is expected almost to double by 2020, the issue of how to dispose of highly radioactive waste properly is an international concern of growing importance. As of now, no country has yet solved the problem of what to do with the mounting inventories of spent nuclear fuel created as a by-product of nuclear power generation. This article focuses on national approaches for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and discusses the need for a global approach to cope adequately with the increasing inventories of highly radioactive waste.

J	Pennington, CW				Pennington, Charles W.			Comparative population dose risks from nuclear fuel cycle closure and renewal of the commercial nuclear energy alternative in the US	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Nuclear renaissance; Population dose risks; Nuclear energy radiation exposure; United States population dose risks; Comparative radiation dose risks; Public attitudes on nuclear energy	INDUSTRIES	The debate over a large expansion of commercial nuclear energy for electricity production in the U.S., termed a "nuclear renaissance," has most recently focused on the issues of spent nuclear fuel transportation and the closing of the once-through nuclear fuel cycle through the licensing, construction, and operation of the national spent nuclear fuel repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. While such a commercial nuclear energy expansion is postulated to have environmental, climate, resource utilization, and economic benefits, the fundamental issue for typical U.S. citizens about nuclear energy concerns the potential for exposure to ionizing radiation. Two generations of U.S. citizens have experienced public and media "education" that has heightened their primal fears of ionizing radiation from commercial nuclear energy. In such an environment, comparing the risks of radiation doses from commercial nuclear energy fuel cycle closure and further nuclear energy expansion with ionizing radiation population doses experienced year after year, decade after decade from non-nuclear (conventional) industries seems worthwhile for use in achieving stakeholder education and concurrence. The U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) has recently performed its own landmark risk assessment of spent fuel transport in the U.S., demonstrating the guiding principles and methods for use in comparative risk assessments involving radiation dose considerations. Using the NAS assessment approach, this paper broadens its application to the full consideration of the risk of nuclear fuel cycle closure and renewal of the commercial nuclear energy alternative in the U.S., to evaluate the ionizing radiation dose risks of such expansion compared to those routinely accepted for non-nuclear industries by policy makers and the public. The 50-year collective dose risk from the total commercial nuclear fuel cycle, even if the U.S. triples its installed nuclear capacity, transports spent fuel to Yucca Mountain, and operates the Yucca Mountain repository as planned, is shown to be in the range of 3.1-million person-cSv; for five selected non-nuclear industries, the corresponding 50-year collective dose risk exceeds 1 billion person-cSv, a more than 300 times greater risk. A key step towards renewing the commercial nuclear energy alternative, then, is to use this knowledge for education of various stakeholder parties. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Calculations for the amount of fuel that the plants will use and generate during 40 years of operation under each scenario were made. An evaluation of costs for each option applying current prices for uranium and services were then carried out. Finally a comparison between the options was made, and it was found that the recycling option is more expensive than the once through cycle by about 4%. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A new phi 20 mm annular centrifugal contactor for laboratory scale has been developed for the hot test of the total TRPO process. A modular design, a multi-stage group housing design and ceramic bearings are adopted in the new centrifugal contactor. A sampling system and a rotor speed acquisition and monitoring system for phi 20 mm annular centrifugal contactors have been developed for tests in the hot cell. The hydraulic performance of both a single-stage centrifugal contactor and a three-stage cascade has been studied. The nominal throughput of the single-stage centrifugal contactor can reach 13.5 1/h under suitable operation conditions for H(2)O-kerosene system. The hydraulic performance of the three-stage cascade is also good. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ahn, MH; Lee, SC; Lee, KJ				Ahn, Min Ho; Lee, Sang Chul; Lee, Kun Jai			Disposal concept for LILW in Korea: Characterization methodology and the disposal priority	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						DAW; Evaporator bottom; Spent resin; Spent filter; Waste characterization; Disposal priority		Since 1977 the Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Co. has generated about 67,000 drums (200 L) of low and intermediate level radioactive waste (LILW) and the drums are stored in the temporary storage facility at each reactor site. The accumulated dry active waste (DAW) amounts to around 36,600 drums. There are around 19,000 drums with evaporator bottoms, 9700 drums of spent resin, and 1600 drums of spent filters. This study proposes four mandatory items with regard to the radioactive characterization of LILW: namely, the total activity, surface dose, individual activity, and surface contamination. The required contents of the physical characterization include the weight (density), voidage, free liquid, and homogeneity. For the chemical characterization, the required contents include leachability, corrosiveness, explosiveness, and chelation. Finally, the compressive strength and integrity of drums are requested for the mechanical characterization. To determine the disposal priority of LILW in the Republic of Korea, the authors considered two main factors, namely, the waste management situation in Korea and overseas case studies. After considering those factors, the authors established a disposal priority for the LILW: (1) concentrated waste solidified with the cement and low radioactive DAW, the characterization of which can be readily identified in detail; (2) spent resin solidified with cement; (3) spent filters; (4) highly radioactive DAW, the characterization of which is well documented; and (5) waste that needs to be researched further, including spent resin in PE-HIC, evaporator bottoms and concentrated waste solidified with paraffin, and DAW that contains some harmful materials.

J	Muhammad, F; Majid, A				Muhammad, Farhan; Majid, Asad			Effects of high density dispersion fuel loading on the dynamics of a low enriched uranium fueled material test research reactor	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						MTR; PARET; High density fuels; Reactivity insertion transient; Loss of flow transient	PARAMETERS	The effects of using high density low enriched uranium on the dynamics of a material test research reactor were studied. For this purpose, the low density LEU fuel of an MTR was replaced with high density LEU fuels currently being developed under the RERTR program. Since the alloying elements have different properties affecting the reactor in different ways, fuels U-Mo (9w/o) which contain the same elements in same ratio were selected for analysis. Simulations were carried out to determine the reactor performance under reactivity insertion and loss of flow transients. Nuclear reactor analysis code PARET was employed to carry out these calculations. It is observed that during the fast reactivity insertion transient, the maximum reactor power is achieved and the energy released till the power reaches its maximum increases by 45% and 18.5%, respectively, as uranium density increases from 6.57 gU/cm(3) to 8.90 gU/cm(3). This results in increased maximum temperatures of fuel, clad and coolant outlet, achieved during the transient, by 27.7 K, 19.7 K and 7.9 K, respectively. The time required to reach the peak power decreases. During the slow reactivity insertion transient, the maximum reactor power achieved increases slightly by 0.3% as uranium density increases from 6.57 gU/cm(3) to 8.90 gU/cm(3) but the energy generated till the power reaches its maximum decreases by 5.7%. The temperatures of fuel, clad and coolant outlet remain almost the same for all types of fuels. During the loss of flow transients, no appreciable difference in the power and temperature profiles was observed and the graph plots overlapped each other. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods for determining operation life and reactivity depletion for space reactors with fast energy spectra	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Space nuclear reactors; Fast neutron spectrum; Reactivity depletion; Operation life; SCoRe concepts	POWER-SYSTEM; RADIATOR; SCORE	Space reactors with fast neutron energy spectrums are preferred for their compactness and high fission power density, but require a high fissile inventory. The operation life estimates of these reactors are important to mission planning. This paper examines a number of fuel depletion and neutronics code packages for determining the operation lives of two space reactors with hard fast neutron energy spectra. These are: the lithium-cooled, Sectored, Compact Reactor (SCoRe-S(11)), and the submersion subcritical safe space (S(boolean AND)4) reactor, cooled with a He-Xe binary gas mixture (40 g/mol). This work investigated the code packages of Monteburns 2.0, MCNPX 2.6C and TRITON and validated their prediction with fuel depletion data for a PWR fuel bundle, with satisfactory results. The operation life predictions of the two space reactors using these code packages are compared with those calculated using a simplified method that couples MCNP5 to a burnup analysis model using the Simulink (R) platform. This method considers only the 10 most probable low-Z and high-Z elements of the fission yield peaks plus (149)Sm, and neglects the depletion of fission products due to capture and radioactive decay. The simplified method requires significantly shorter running time and its predictions of the operation lives for the two space reactors are within 0.29-12.5% of those obtained using Monteburns 2.0 and MCNPX 2.6C code packages. This method, however, is not recommended for operation life predictions for space or commercial reactors with thermal neutron spectrums. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Estimation of the activation of local reactor shielding concretes	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Local shielding concrete; Activation of concrete		Many elements in reactor shielding concrete become radioactive due to interaction with neutrons during the operation of a nuclear reactor. These radioactive elements will build up over the time due to (n,gamma) reaction and contribute to the radioactive waste during decommissioning of the reactor, they will increase the dose from the inner part of the biological shielding (concrete) surrounding a nuclear reactor during maintenance works within reactor containment, and their effect should be taken in the calculations of the dose behind the concrete shield. Six mixtures of local ordinary and special shielding concretes have been investigated in this study. Their compositions were determined using X-ray diffraction and neutron activation analysis using the Syrian Miniature Neutron Source Reactor (MNSR) and consequently the dose rates. Based on the results of the analyses and comparing to the published limits in the references, it has been found that (60)Co, (152)Eu, (154)Eu and (134)Cs will be the most effective radioactive nuclides existing in the local concrete, but Dolomite aggregates contain the minimum limits of them and it has been found that Fe.

A comparative study of integral parameters for TRX and BAPL benchmark lattices of thermal reactors using the cross-section library generated from JENDL and JEF evaluated data files	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						TRX, BAPL benchmark lattices; Integral parameters; NJOY'99; WIMSD-5B; TRIGA		The objective of this paper is to present the results of comparative study of integral parameters for TRX and BAPL benchmark lattices of thermal reactors. The nuclear data processing code NJOY'99 was deployed for the generation of the 69-group cross-section library from the basic evaluated nuclear data files JENDL-3.2 and JEF-2.2. TRX and BAPL benchmark lattices were modeled with optimized inputs, which were suggested in the final report of the WIMS Library Update Project Stage-1. The inputs were the results of a detailed parametric study of the WIMS input options and also optimized for accuracy. The integral parameters (such as k(eff), p(28), delta(25), delta(28), C(+)) of five uranium-fuel thermal assemblies: TRX-1 and TRX-2 and BAPL-1, BAPL-2, and BAPL-3 were calculated with the help of WIMSD-5B code based on the generated 69-group cross-section library. The calculated results are compared with those of experiments and it is found that the obtained results between the two libraries are in good agreement with each other. Besides, the calculated integral parameters are also well consistent with the measured values, which reflect the validation of the generated 69-group cross-section library and this library thus obtained is necessary to meet up the nuclear data for neutronics calculation of TRIGA Mark-H research reactor at AERE, Savar, Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Apart from burnt flints and heated limestones, the material being dated, THAT IS our principal concern here, is made of burnt sediment samples collected from a reddish layer that forms the very base of the Roc de Marsal Mousterian sequence (Couche B). U-series disequilibria of long life nuclides in sediments were observed: as a general trend, the activity Of (238)U is greater than that of (226)Ra. Important discrepancies in age determination can occur according to the origin of the disequilibrium and its kinetics. To characterise these ancient modifications of radioactivity and constrain the range of possible variations of annual doses, a statistical study of (238)U, (226)Ra and (232)Th activities, measured by gamma spectrometry, was carried out. It shows that the sediment was mainly enriched in mobile uranium. This conclusion is in accordance with the results of complementary measurements of (230)Th and (234)U performed by alpha spectrometry. On the kinetics side, two models of time-variation of U and daughter concentrations are compared, taking experimental data into account. A detailed presentation of the methodology and the method of calculation of dose rates, and particularly time-averaged dose rates in such a situation, is given. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
