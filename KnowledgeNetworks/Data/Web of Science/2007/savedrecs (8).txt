Use of a paraffin-based grout to stabilize buried beryllium and other wastes	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						beryllium; WAXFIX; waste	SOIL	The long-term durability of WAXFIX, a paraffin-based grout, was evaluated for in situ grouting of activated beryllium wastes in the subsurface disposal area (SDA), a radioactive landfill at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex, part of the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). The evaluation considered radiological and biological mechanisms that could degrade the grout using data from an extensive literature search and previous tests of in situ grouting at the INL. Conservative radioactive doses for WAXFIX were calculated from the "hottest" (i.e., highest-activity) Advanced Test Reactor beryllium block in the SDA. These results indicate that WAXFIX would not experience extensive radiation damage for many hundreds of years. Calculation of radiation-induced hydrogen generation in WAXFIX indicated that grout physical performance should not be reduced beyond the effects of radiation dose on the molecular structure. Degradation of a paraffin-based grout by microorganisms in the SDA is possible and perhaps likely, but the rate of degradation will be at a slower rate than found in the literature reviewed. The calculations showed the outer 0.46-m (18-in.) layer of each monolith, which represents the minimum expected distance to the beryllium block, was calculated to require 1000 to 3600yr to be consumed. The existing data and estimations of biodegradation and radiolysis rates for WAXFIX/paraffin do not indicate any immediate problems with the use of WAXFIX for grouting beryllium or other wastes in the SDA.

J	Wongsawaeng, D; Olander, D				Wongsawaeng, Doonyapong; Olander, Donald			Liquid-metal bond for lwr fuel rods	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						liquid-metal bond; fuel-cladding gap	GAP	A liquid metal (LM) consisting of one-third weight fraction each of Pb, Sn, and Bi has been investigated as the bonding substance in place of He in the pellet-cladding gap of light water reactor fuel elements. The LM bond eliminates the large Delta T over the preclosure gap that is characteristic of helium-bonded fuel elements. Because the LM does not wet either UO2 or Zircaloy, simply loading fuel pellets into a cladding tube containing LM at atmospheric pressure leaves unfilled regions (voids) in the bond, which lead to local fuel hot spots. Voids were eliminated during fabrication by first evacuating the rod loaded with solid alloy and a fuel stack, melting the alloy, pushing down the fuel stack to drive the LM into the gap, and finally applying at least 5 atm He overpressure. Fabrication of a 4-m-long full-scale fuel rod using this technique was successfully demonstrated. A destructive examination revealed numerous breaks in the frozen alloy bond, but all of these appeared to result from handling the fuel rod. Application to commercial fuel manufacturing should require only minor modifications to existing fabrication lines. The most suitable non-destructive examination technique utilizes a collimated X-ray beam to probe edge-on the region between the pellet surface and the cladding inside diameter.

J	Ghita, G; Sjoden, G; Baciak, J				Ghita, Gabriel; Sjoden, Glenn; Baciak, James			A methodology for experimental and 3-d computational radiation transport assessments of Pu-Be neutron sources	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Pu-Be; S-N transport; Monte Carlo		Plutonium-beryllium (Pu-Be) sources can be used as didactic source materials for special nuclear materials (SNM) detection evaluation protocols. Since limited specific information exists for many of the Pu-Be sources currently in service, before using a Pu-Be source for field studies, the leakage radiation of neutrons and gamma rays from the source must be fully assessed. Most Pu-Be sources have an outer stainless steel jacket and an inner tantalum jacket, with the Pu-Be homogeneously distributed throughout the inner jacket. To fully characterize the net leakage terms from our Pu-Be source, we applied three-dimensional radiation transport computations, including Monte Carlo (MCNP5) and deterministic (PENTRAN) methodologies. The transport model for our Pu-Be capsule is based on limited schematic and technical data. To define the decay history and resulting source spectrum, exothermic [alpha-neutron (alpha, n)] reactions are modeled using OrigenArp in the SCALE5 package. For transport modeling purposes, the intermetallic Pu-Be compound was treated as an intimate mixture of Plutonium and beryllium, based on the manufacturer's mass specifications. The net capsule leakage was derived using transport computations, and an iterative estimation of plutonium age was performed. Computational results for net leakage are in agreement with the manufacturer's specification of neutron yield and dose rate. We also combined computational results with experimental measurement data to fully validate our computational methods. We have successfully achieved agreement between computational and experimental data for our Pu-Be source leakage, and we are using the results at the Florida Institute of Nuclear Detection and Security to evaluate a prototype SNM neutron detector array for parcel screening and national security applications.

Comparison of population and external detector method dating in epidote	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article							FISSION DECAY CONSTANT; TRACK TECHNIQUES; THIN-FILMS; URANIUM; U-238; DOSIMETRY	Epidote fission-track dating (FTD) was performed through both Population and external detector method (EDM) in five samples from the Mantiqueira Mountain range, southwestern Brazil. The ages obtained via population conducted to a weighted mean age of (114 +/- 19) Ma. In order to perform EDM dating, it was necessary to measure the efficiency factor (g) between muscovite mica and epidote. Three measurements were performed and the weighted mean g value obtained was (0.57 +/- 0.03). The weighted EDM age was (98 +/- 7) Ma. The population error magnitude occurs due to the existence of few useful epidote grains. EDM provides dating with fewer grains, however there are difficulties concerning etching anisotropy that should be regarded. Both dating methods agreed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Changes in the amount of thermal neutrons (E <= 0.414 eV) were analyzed to estimate, for each neutron source, the coefficient that relates the neutron Source strength and room surface area with the thermal neutron fluence rates. The study was carried Out using Monte Carlo methods for 200,400, 500, 800, 1000, 1200 and 1500-cm-radius spherical cavity in Vacuum; cavities are 100-cm-thick concrete. Point sources were located at the center of cavity and neutron spectra were calculated at several source-to-detector distances along the cavity radius. The thermal neutron contribution was thereby evaluated. From these calculations a weighted coefficient value that relates the thermal neutron fluence with the neutron Source strength and the total inner area surface of the cavity was estimated to be 3.76 +/- 0.03.

Activity concentration results for radium isotopes Ra-226.228, uranium isotopes U-234.238 and isotopic ratios U-234/U-238 were determined. The correlations between investigated isotopes and calculated potassium K-40 ions dissolved in water were carried out. The results show a correlation between TDS (total dissolved solids) values and dissolved radionuclides. High correlation coefficients were observed between total radium content and 40K. The isotopic ratio of U-234/U-238 varies in the range from 1.6 to 7 in all investigated waters which means that there is no radioactive equilibrium between the parent nuclide U-238 and its daughter U-234. The effective radiation dose coming from studied radium and uranium radionuclides consumed with mineral water from the Outer Carpathians obtained by a statistical Pole is equal to 4.3 mu Sv/year (581/year water consumption) and do not exceed the permissible limit equal to 100 mu Sv/year. Assuming 0.51 consumption per day, i.e. 182.51/year, the effective dose is equal to 13.4 mu Sv/year. what is still below the unit. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Measurements of outdoor gamma radiation (of terrestrial and cosmic origin) in air were performed at 112 locations using a plastic scintillator and the average absorbed dose was found as 60.9 nGy/h (corresponding to an effective close of 74.7 mu Sv/y). The radionuclide activity concentrations in 45 soil samples collected from the study area were measured through gamma-ray spectrometry and the average activities were determined as 20.8. 24.95 and 298.6 for the natural radionuclides U-238, Th-232 and K-40, respectively, and 9.08 Bq/kg for the fission product Cs-137. The natural radioactivity sources resulted in an effective dose of 46.9 mu Sv/y. The radioactivity levels of 53 drinking water samples were measured as 0.038 Bq/l for gross-alpha activity and 0.1324 Bq/l for gross-beta activity using gross-alpha and gross-beta counting methods (equivalent to a,in effective dose of 7.76 mu Sv/y). When compared with the data available for other Turkish cities, the outdoor gamma doses and soil radioactivity concentrations obtained in this study indicate a background radiation level that falls within natural limits. Oil the other hand, the measured gross-alpha and -beta activities in drinking water are relatively higher. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Radon survey related to construction materials and soils in Zacatecas, Mexico using LR-115	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article						radon; building materials; soils; LR-115; SSNTD; Zacatecas	EXHALATION RATE; INDOOR RN-222; STATE; RADIOACTIVITY; DWELLINGS; THORON	Indoor radon gas (Rn-222), present in the air inside buildings, is one of the most important sources of radiation exposure to the population. This gas originates in the U-238 radioactive decay chain, which is contained in rock and solid soil particles. Radon accumulation in confined spaces, inside buildings, depends on several factors such as the type of soils, type of constructions, building materials, and ventilation. The aim of this work is to present indoor and outdoor radon concentrations for 202 dwellings and indoor concentrations for 148 Public Clinics; and the radon concentrations relate to the type of predominant soils, the construction years; and building materials used in the ceilings, walls and floors, for cities and towns of the 57 municipalities in the State of Zacatecas, Mexico. The Rn-222 concentrations were measured with a passive-type radon monitor, with LR-115 as detector material; and the radon Survey was made during four stages of three months each throughout Zacatecas from 2001 to 2002. The indoor and outdoor radon concentration averages in dwellings were 55.6 +/- 4.9 Bq m(-3) and 46.5 +/- 5.3 Bq m(-3), respectively. The indoor radon concentration average in public clinics was 57.8 +/- 5.4 Bq m(-3). These values were lower than the US EPA action limit of 148 Bq m(-3). (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Liquid xenon, highly purified and filtered using advanced semiconductor industry technologies serves as an attractive target for several modern experiments searching for cold dark matter, double beta decay, and detection of low energy neutrino. Separation of xenon from trace amounts of Kr-85 cannot be achieved with commercially available gas purifiers. We have developed an automated system for purification of xenon from trace amounts of krypton. The system has been used to purify 25 kg of xenon to the level of < 3 ppt of krypton. The purified xenon will be used for the two-phase emission detector, XENON 10, to search for WIMP dark matter in the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Operation of a high-purity germanium crystal in liquid argon as a Compton-suppressed radiation spectrometer	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th Symposium on Rediation Measurements and Applications	MAY 23-26, 2006	Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI		Univ Michigan	high-purity germanium spectrometer; compton suppression; liquid argon scintillation; ultra-low background counting	RADIOACTIVITY	A high-purity germanium (HPGe) crystal was operated in liquid argon (LAr) as a Compton-suppressed radiation spectrometer. Spectroscopic quality resolution of less than 1% of the full-width half-maximum of full energy deposition peaks was demonstrated. The construction of the small apparatus used to obtain these results is reported. The design concept is to use the LAr bath to both cool the germanium crystal to operating temperatures and act as a scintillating veto. The scintillation light from the LAr can veto cosmic rays, external primordial radiation, and gamma radiation that does not fully deposit within the germanium crystal. This technique was investigated for its potential impact on ultra-low-background gamma-ray spectroscopy. This work is based on a concept initially developed for future germanium-based neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

They have been developed over the last several decades, initially driven by particle and astrophysics applications, more recently also for material science, biophysics and nuclear science applications. The Advanced Detector Group at LLNL is developing cryogenic Gamma-ray and fast-neutron spectrometers for nuclear diagnostics in fundamental science and national security. They are based on measuring the increase in temperature upon photon or particle absorption with a sensor operated at the transition between its superconducting and its normal state. The approach can be adapted for different types of radiation with the appropriate choice of absorber material. We describe our Gamma-ray spectrometers consisting of a bulk Sn absorber attached to a superconducting Mo/Cu multilayer sensor. The detectors are operated at a temperature of similar to 0. 1 K the end of a cold finger in a two-stage adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator, and have, depending on design, achieved an energy resolution between 50 and 150eV FWHM for energies below 100keV. Here we give an overview about cryogenic detectors for nuclear diagnostics, and discuss the application of this detector technology to the measurement of uranium enrichment.

Among these applications are characterization of nuclear reactor fuel and detection of concealed fissionable materials, which both require the optimization of SiC fast neutron detectors for detection and quantification of fission neutrons. In order to enhance fast-neutron sensitivity, proton recoil techniques are being used. Fission neutrons were simulated by using a 2.5-MeV deuterium-deuterium (D-D) neutron generator. In order to optimize the neutron detection sensitivity, 2.5-MeV neutron proton-recoil response measurements were made as a function of polyethylene converter layer thickness. Measurements were also made of the sensitivity of the SiC proton recoil detector as a function of angle of incidence of the neutrons. As expected from the angular sensitivity of the detector response, detection of neutrons normally incident to the detector face is favored allowing discrimination of background neutrons and possibly supplying information on the fissionable material location or configuration.

In this study, we designed a front-end electronic circuit for high-rate neutron counters installed in a high-level gamma-radiation hot cell. All the transistors adopted for this circuit are not radiation-hardened ones, i.e. commercial ones not specifically processed for a radiation resistance. The aim of our study was to seek more radiation-resistant transistors from among the commercial ones and to verify the radiation hardness of the circuit composed of these transistors. The circuit includes a preamplifier, a comparator, and a monostable multivibrator. To realize the radiation hardness of this circuit with commercial transistors, the transistors were categorized into two groups: general speed and high-speed transistors. After a 100 Mrad irradiation from a (CO)-C-60 gamma-ray source, the reduction of the current gain of the general speed transistors was over 80% and that of the high-speed transistors was below 68%. The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of the preamplifier output voltage was reduced by 66% for the former and by 36% for the latter. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A gamma-ray background model for Monte Carlo simulations	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th Symposium on Rediation Measurements and Applications	MAY 23-26, 2006	Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI		Univ Michigan	gamma-ray background; background radiation; Geant4; Monte Carlo; Compton imager		We present here a gamma-ray background model for a typical urban environment. Such models are crucial for realistic evaluations of the sensitivity of nuclear detection systems. The model spectrum consists of a collection of lines and a continuum component. The details of the iterative approach used in the creation of the model are discussed. When the final model is used as the source spectrum emitted by the ground or the concrete walls surrounding a typical coaxial Ge detector, the simulated response of the detector matches the data observed in the field extremely well. The final emission spectrum is very precise, and contains features crucial in nuclear detection applications. The prominent K-40 line (1460.8 keV) is clearly seen, as well as the 2615 keV peak due to Tl-208 (thorium natural decay series). The lines of U-238 (1001.2 keV) and U-235 (185.7 keV) are also present. We find this spectrum to be a useful tool for estimating sensitivities in our Monte Carlo modeling of several nuclear detector setups. We offer this model to the community for unlimited use, in the form of a Geant4 class or as a table of 'intensity vs. energy' for use with other Monte Carlo packages. We also note that the iterative procedure described here can be used for the creation of other background spectra. Published by Elsevier B.V.

It is based on interrogation with a pulsed beam of 3-7 MeV neutrons that produce fission events and subsequent detection of their beta-delayed neutron emission or beta-delayed high-energy gamma-radiation reveals the presence of fissionable material. Fission product beta-delayed gamma-rays above 3 MeV are nearly 10 times more abundant than beta-delayed neutrons and are distinct from natural radioactivity and from nearly all of the induced activity in a normal cargo. Detector backgrounds and potential interferences with the fission signature radiation have been identified and quantified. Their impact on detection sensitivity is relatively minor and can be addressed readily. Components of a simple laboratory prototype have been assembled, tested with the most challenging cargo threat scenarios, and results compared to computer simulations. Preliminary results will be presented. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

It is based on a large field-of-view Compton gamma-ray imager that uses 24 layers of 2 mm thick, position-sensitive (1.4mm strips) silicon detectors, designed for room-temperature operation, as a scatterer and a position-sensitive NaI scintillator array as the absorber. Each layer of silicon detectors consists of double-sided silicon strip detectors daisy chained in a 3 x 3 array with a total active area of 729 cm(2). The NaI detectors are 2.9 x 2.9 cm(2) and 7.6 cm thick and will cover the bottom and sides of the instrument. Simulations of an ASIC-based readout system show that an energy resolution of 4.5keV full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) at room temperature is attainable on each daisy-chained silicon strip assuming 35 pF of capacitance and 20 nA of leakage current. Full simulations of the current instrument design are shown and are demonstrated that it can detect 8 kg of shielded HEU at 2.5m in 1 min in a realistic gamma-ray background environment.

The TGS technique combines High Resolution Gamma Spectrometry (HRGS) with Three-Dimensional (3-D) low spatial resolution transmission and emission image reconstruction techniques to achieve assay goals. When compared to the traditional methods such as Segmented Gamma Scanning (SGS), the TGS technique can yield better accuracies for cases where the radionuclide is distributed non-uniformly in a heterogeneous matrix. The TGS technique is ideally suited for low-to-moderate density waste matrices, say 1.0 g cm(-3) or below for 55 US gal. drums, although it can be extended to higher densities by using alternative approaches to the design or analyses. Recently Canberra Industries designed, built and characterized four such TGS systems for nuclear power plant applications. Many of the design features and the end application itself set these TGS systems apart from the others that had been built previously. The four TGS systems are the first commercial grade systems that could quantify radionuclides contained in nuclear power plant waste, using the TGS technique. The TGS systems featured two different combinations of collimator and source-detector distance; a "near" geometry with a collimator aperture of 50.8 min and a "Far" geometry with a narrower collimator aperture of 40.6 mm. For assaying drums with matrix densities greater than 1.0 g cm(-3) and/or dose rates greater than 6 mSv h(-1) the system could be configured as a SGS. In the SGS mode, five different assay geometries could be configured using different collimator, source-to-detector distance and absorber combinations. During operation, the appropriate assay geometry was selected automatically based on the drum weight (density) and dose rate measurements. The characterization and performance of the one of the TGS systems are discussed in detail for both TGS and SGS modes of operation. Quantitative results are presented for point source and rod source nuclide distributions. Transmission and emission images obtained in the TGS assays will be presented. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

These detectors are part of standardized spectrometry systems: germanium detectors for High-Resolution Gamma Spectrometry (HRGS); Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) detectors for Room Temperature Gamma Spectrometry (RTGS); and NaI(TI) detectors for Low Resolution Gamma Spectrometry (LRGS). HRGS with high-purity Germanium (HpGe) detectors cooled by liquid nitrogen is widely used in nuclear safeguards to verify the isotopic composition of plutonium or uranium in non-irradiated material. Alternative cooling systems have been evaluated and electrically cooled HpGe detectors show a potential added value, especially for unattended measurements. The spectrometric performance of CZT detectors, their robustness and simplicity are key to the successful verification of irradiated materials. Further development, such as limiting the charge trapping effects in CZT to provide improved sensitivity and energy resolution are discussed. NaI(TI) detectors have many applications-specifically in hand-held radioisotope identification devices (RID) which are used to detect the presence of radioactive material where a lower resolution is sufficient, as they benefit from a generally higher sensitivity. The Agency is also continuously involved in the review and evaluation of new and emerging technologies in the field of radiation detection such as: Peltier-cooled CdTe detectors; semiconductor detectors operating at room temperature such as HgI2 and GaAs; and, scintillator detectors using glass fibres or LaBr3. A final conclusion, proposing recommendations for future action, is made. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This is accomplished by integrating neutron and spectroscopic gamma-ray detectors into a container crane spreader bar, the part of the crane that directly engages the intermodal shipping containers while moving from ship to shore and vice versa. The use of a spectroscopic gamma-detector reduces the rate of nuisance alarms due to naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM). The combination Of 7 and neutron detection reduces the effectiveness of shielding and countermeasures. The challenges in this spreader bar-based approach arise from the harsh environment, particularly the mechanical shock and the vibration of the moving spreader bar, since the measurement is taken while the container is moving. The electrical interfaces in the port environment, from the crane to a central monitoring office, present further challenges. It is the packaging, electronic interfaces, and data processing software that distinguish this system, which is based on conventional radiation sensors. The core of the system is Amptek's GAMMA-RAD, which integrates a ruggedized scintillator/PMT, digital pulse shaping electronics, electronics for the neutron detector, power supplies, and an Ethernet interface. The design of the VeriTainer system and results from both the laboratory and a proof-of-concept test at the Port of Oakland, California will be presented. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For high sensitivity, monitoring stations use a complex system of separate beta and gamma detectors to detect beta-gamma coincidences from characteristic radioxenon isotopes in small amounts of xenon extracted from large volumes of air. We report a simpler approach that uses a single phoswich detector, comprising optically coupled plastic and CsI scintillators to absorb beta particles and gamma rays, respectively, and then detect coincidences by pulse shape analysis of the detector signal. Previous studies with a planar prototype detector have shown that the technique can clearly separate beta only, gamma only and coincidence events, does not degrade the energy resolution, and has an error rate for detecting coincidences of less than 0.1%. In this paper, we will present a new phoswich well detector design, consisting of a 1" diameter plastic cell enclosed in a 3" Csl crystal. Based on Monte Carlo modeling and experimental results, the design will be characterized in terms of energy resolution and its ability to separate beta and gamma only, and coincidence events.

A thin source of Cm-244 was prepared by an electromagnetic isotope separator for this measurement, and the daughter nuclide Pu-240 was allowed to grow for 32.7 yr. The alpha spectrum of the Cm-244 source was measured with silicon detectors and the ratio of the Pu-240 and Cm-244 activities was determined. From this ratio and the previously known half-life Of Cm-244 (18.11 +/- 0.03 yr), the half-life of Pu-240 was determined to be T-1/2 = 6545 +/- 19 yr. This is in excellent agreement with the value of 6564 11 yr recommended by the US Half-Life Evaluation Committee. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The final goal of this project consists of the production of 1 GeV proton beams, which will be used for various medical and industrial applications as well as for research in basic and applied sciences. Carbon and copper in the proton accelerator for PEPP, through activation, become radionuclides such as Be-7 and Cu-64. Copper is a major element of the accelerator components and the carbon is planned to be used as a target material of the beam dump. A recent survey showed that the currently available cross-sections create a large difference from the experimental data in the production of some residual nuclides by the proton-induced reactions for carbon and copper. To more accurately estimate the production of radioactive nuclides in the accelerator, proton cross-sections for carbon and copper are evaluated. The TALYS code was used for the evaluation of the cross-sections for the proton-induced reactions. To obtain the crosssections which best fits the experimental data, optical model parameters for the neutron, proton and other complex particles such as the deuteron and alpha were successively adjusted. The evaluated cross-sections in this study are compared with the measurements and other evaluations. (c) 2007 Elsevier BV. All rights reserved.

Nuclear reactions with radioactive, isomer beams: Coulomb excitation of F-18(g.s.) and its J pi=5(+) isomer F-18(m) using a large position-sensitive NaI array	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th Symposium on Rediation Measurements and Applications	MAY 23-26, 2006	Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI		Univ Michigan	coulomb excitation; radioactive nuclear beams; position-sensitive gamma-array; isomer beams		Intermediate-energy projectile Coulomb excitation of the unstable nucleus F-18(g.s.) and its short-lived E-x = 1.1 MeV (J(pi) = 5(+)) isomeric state (t(1/2) = 162 ns) F-18(m) have been studied at 30 MeV per nucleon. Radioactive beams of F-18(g.s.) and F-18(m) nuclei were produced by nucleon transfer on a carbon production target and delivered to a secondary Au-197 target for Coulomb excitation. Photons emitted in the vicinity of the Au-197 target were detected in a large-solid-angle position-sensitive NaI(TI) array, which allowed for the identification of the beam and target excited states populated by intermediate-energy Coulomb excitation. Two possible F-18 ground-state excitations were identified, and B(E lambda up arrow) values were deduced. Upper limits were established for reduced transition probabilities B(E1 up arrow) and B(E2 up arrow) of several predicted transitions from the F-18(m) isomeric state, 5(+) -> 4(+), -> 4(-), 3(+), and compared with values inferred from gamma-decay lifetimes. An indication of an enhanced in-flight isomer decay, possibly due to the Coulomb interaction with the target is observed and discussed. The special detector configurations and analytical techniques needed for these types of measurements are described together with suggested improvements. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Cleaning and passivation of copper surfaces to remove surface radioactivity and prevent oxide formation	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th Symposium on Rediation Measurements and Applications	MAY 23-26, 2006	Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI		Univ Michigan	ultra-low background; surface contamination; surface preparation; surface passivation; high-purity copper; double-beta decay		High-purity copper is an attractive material for constructing ultra-low-background radiation measurement devices. Many low-background experiments using high-purity copper have indicated surface contamination emerges as the dominant background. Radon daughters plate out on exposed surfaces, leaving a residual 2 Pb-210 background that is difficult to avoid. Dust is also a problem; even under cleanroom conditions, the amount of U and Th deposited on surfaces can represent the largest remaining background. To control these backgrounds, a copper cleaning chemistry has been developed. Designed to replace an effective, but overly aggressive concentrated nitric acid etch, this peroxide-based solution allows for a more controlled cleaning of surfaces. The acidified hydrogen peroxide solution will generally target the Cu+/Cu2+ species which are the predominant surface participants, leaving the bulk of copper metal intact. This preserves the critical tolerances of parts and eliminates significant waste disposal issues. Accompanying passivation chemistry has also been developed that protects copper surfaces from oxidation. Using a high-activity polonium surface spike, the most difficult-to-remove daughter isotope of radon, the performance of these methods are quantified. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

After freeze-drying I L of each water, neutron activation analysis (NAA) with both thermal and epithermal neutrons was applied, the latter to ease the determination of iodine. Levels of iodine were found to be low and not likely associated to a higher risk of thyroid cancers in the area. However, other chemical elements in the sampled waters could pose some threats from the point of view of human health: aluminium and bromine. Some samples contained arsenic and/or uranium, yet the levels of these two elements were below the regulated values. NAA demonstrated to be very adequate for analysis of iodine and other elements, via shortlived nuclides. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An ultracold neutron source at the NC state university PULSTAR reactor	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th Symposium on Rediation Measurements and Applications	MAY 23-26, 2006	Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI		Univ Michigan	ultracold neutrons; cold neutrons; neutron source; nuclear reactor	SOLID-DEUTERIUM SOURCE; COLD NEUTRONS	Research and development is being completed for an ultracold neutron (UCN) source to be installed at the PULSTAR reactor on the campus of North Carolina State University (NCSU). The objective is to establish a university-based UCN facility with sufficient UCN intensity to allow world-class fundamental and applied research with UCN. To maximize the UCN yield, a solid ortho-D-2 converter will 14 be implemented coupled to two moderators, D2O at room temperature, to thermalize reactor neutrons, and solid CH4, to moderate the thermal neutrons to cold-neutron energies. The source assembly will be located in a tank of D2O in the space previously occupied by the thermal column of the PULSTAR reactor. Neutrons leaving a bare face of the reactor core enter the D2O tank through a 45 x 45 cm cross-sectional area void between the reactor core and the D2O tank. Liquid He will cool the disk-shaped UCN converter to below 5 K. Independently, He gas will cool the cup-shaped CH4 cold-neutron moderator to an optimum temperature between 20 and 40 K. The UCN will be transported from the converter to experiments by a guide with an inside diameter of 16 cm. Research areas being considered for the PULSTAR UCN source include time-reversal violation in neutron beta decay, neutron lifetime determination, support measurements for a neutron electric-dipole-moment search, and nanoscience applications.

In 9 patients, a single intravenous dose of (29.6 +/- 3.7) MBq/kg was administered. Blood samples were drawn at different time intervals, and urine was collected for up to one week. Tissue distribution of I-131-chTNT was followed for up to one week by gamma camera imaging. Absorbed doses to the whole body and to normal organs were computed according to the MIRD scheme using Mirdose-3 software. S-factors for lung tumors were estimated by comparison with lungs of similar mass and position in the body. It was found that mean serum disappearance half time values for I-131-chTNT were (4.93 +/- 9.36) h and (61.7 +/- 21.2) h for a, P respectively, while that for whole body was(99 10) h. Mean urine biological clearance half time value was (90 10) h. The absorbed dose to tumor was (8.28 +/- 2.65) Gy, and the tumor-to-nontumor dose ratio was 3.95 +/- 1.55. And the mean effective dose to patients was (1.02 +/- 0.29) mSv/MBq.

J	Balagi, V; Singh, JP				Balagi, V.; Singh, J. P.			A new design of a re-entrant cavity ionisation chamber for use in brachytherapy	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						ion chambers; re-entrant cavity; brachytherapy	MONTE-CARLO CODE; RADIOACTIVITY; SUBSTANDARDS	A theoretical model has been developed for evaluating the response of re-entrant cavity ion chambers to various gamma energies from simple geometry considerations. The method involves evaluating the charge generated in a differential volume of the chamber and integrating this over the entire volume of the detector. The theory has been applied to two chambers (one having SS cavity wall and the other having Al cavity wall) developed earlier. The calculated and experimental sensitivities of the SS cavity chamber are 12.78 and 12.41 +/- 0.76 pA/MBq for Co-60. For the Al cavity chamber the sensitivity values for 125 1 are, respectively, 0.047 and 0.049 +/- 0.003 pA/MBq. The technique described above has been used to design and develop re-entrant cavity ionisation chambers for the assay of brachytherapy sources. The design provides adequate sensitivity to assay 37MBq of Ir-192 and good saturation at 150 V for 37 GBq of Co-60. The design ensures that the change in the chamber current remains within +/- 2.5% over a 120mm long 'sweet spot'. Since the outer housing of the chambers carries high voltage a special alumina-titania coating by plasma arc spray has been given to prevent electrical shock hazard to users. Two detectors have been developed: one with SS construction is filled with argon while the other one with aluminium construction is filled open to atmosphere. The two detectors have calculated sensitivity of 3.22 and 1.46 pA/MBq for Co-60 The corresponding experimental sensitivities are 3.3 +/- 0.2 and 1.42 +/- 0.085 pA/MBq, respectively.

The system utilizes a triple-layer phoswich detector and a customized Digital Pulse Processor (DPP) designed and built in our laboratory. The DPP board digitally captures the analog signal pulses and, following several digital preprocessing steps, transfers valid pulses to the host computer for further digital processing. A resolving algorithm also was developed to digitally discriminate beta and gamma events, and reconstruct separate beta and gamma-ray energy spectra with minimal crosstalk. The spectrometer has proven to be an effective tool for recording separate beta and gamma-ray spectra from mixed radiation fields. The system as a beta-gamma spectrometer will have broad-ranging applications in nuclear non-proliferation, radioactive waste management, worker safety, systems reliability, dose assessment, and risk analysis.

Burnup studies of spent fuels of varying types and enrichment	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								This paper describes the results of fuel burnup measurements, made over a period of several years on discharged fuel from nuclear power plant and research reactor. The measured and calculated burnup of different spent fuel types, viz.: Natural uranium CANDU fuel bundles; 10.5% enriched booster rods; 20% enriched MTR fuel elements have been presented. High-resolution gamma spectrometry, using Cs-137 and Cs-134 burnup monitors was employed in different reactors to estimate the amount of 235 U depletion in the respective fuel. The experimental data was compared with those of calculations to optimize fuel-scheduling programme. The burnup data is useful for assessment of fuel performance in the core and resolving design issues related to long-term storage facilities. It has been observed that the gamma spectrometry is very effective in identifying exact position of individual booster bundles inside the discharged booster assemblies, which is useful in safeguard applications. It is concluded that the distribution of measured isotopic activity ratios of Cs-134/Cs-137 along the height of the spent fuel gives accurate estimate of the axial neutron flux profiles in the core. The activity ratio technique therefore provides a useful method to determine flux peaking factors at the particular locations of the fuel assemblies in the reactor. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Calculated results are compared with measured data by using standard gamma-ray sources and prompt gamma-rays from pure element samples to check their accuracy. Prompt gamma-rays from pure element samples were used for this determination in the range from 1.942 to 10.829 MeV by use of Am-241-Be neutron source and gamma-rays from radioisotope sources were used in the range from 0.081 to 4.438 MeV. Through the precise modeling of the detector structure, the agreement between both results has been improved. A surprising result is that in the PGNAA method the agreement between the MCNP simulation and experiment will be better by using a suitable neutron shield for NaI detector in order to prevent the activation of NaI (Tl) and a proper gamma-shield to attenuate the high-rate 4.438 MeV gamma-ray, Am-241-Be gamma-ray component.

J	Chau, ND; Chrusciel, E				Chau, Nguyen Dinh; Chrusciel, Edward			Leaching of technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						mining waste; technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material; leaching coefficient; aqueous solutions; chemical composition	WATERS	A form of waste associated with mining activities is related to the type of deposit being mined and to the procedure of exploitation and enrichment adopted. The wastes usually contain relatively large amounts of technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials (TENORM). The TENORM are often stored on the surface. Consequently, they can be leached as a result of interaction with aqueous solutions of different chemical composition. This further leads to pollution of water and soil in the vicinity of the stored wastes. The paper presents the results of laboratory investigation aimed at quantifying the leaching process of samples originating from uranium dumps and storage reservoirs associated with brine pumped from coal mines. The leaching process was investigated with respect to selected elements: uranium isotopes, radium isotopes, iron, barium and sodium. The samples were exposed to aqueous solutions of different chemical composition. The experiments revealed that TENORM in form of sulphate compounds are the most resistant against leaching. The leaching coefficient for radium isotopes varies from a few thousandth percent to a few hundredth percent. On the other hand, for TENORM occurring in sand or sludge, the leaching coefficient for uranium and radium isotopes ranged from a few hundredth percent to a few percent. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Choice of the capacity of a fast reactor for nuclear power	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								Analytical assessments, associated with the choice of the unit capacity of a serially built fast reactor under conditions of the future advancement of nuclear power, are presented. It is shown that considering the limited resources of natural uranium, the development of a reliable raw materials base must be based on the development of fast reactors with expanded breeding of fuel and fuel cycle closure. Since fast reactors, together with energy production, are also producers of new fuel, their parameters must be optimized taking account of this factor on the basis of systems analysis. Calculations show that the optimal capacity for fast reactors is in the 1 GW range.	[Ponomarev-Stepnoi, N. N.; Tsibul'skii, V.

Absorption of optical radiation by nanoclusters of sputtered metallic uranium and its oxides	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article							FISSION FRAGMENTS; FILMS; IONS	Thin films of uranium-containing materials are used as energy-releasing elements in nuclear-pumped lasers. They serve as a source of fission products which ionize and excite the gaseous medium. In this pumping method, a uranium layer is sputtered by its own fission products. This is one of the factors that limit the service life of energy-releasing elements. The products of sputtering can enter the gas and affect the optical and kinetic properties of laser media. In the present work, calculations are performed of the electrodynamic cross-sections for photoabsorption of optical radiation by nanoparticles of metallic uranium and its oxides. The main space-time relaxation parameters are determined. The effect of sputtered uranium-containing nanoparticles on the absorption of optical radiation in a laser element is evaluated.

Chemical analysis of samples of formation liquid from wells located in the dispersion zone of the wastes showed an increase in the content of dissolved carbonic acid, sodium nitrate, and nitrates of radionuclides and an increase of their concentrations in the sampling part. In all other samples, the contents of the main cations and anions were close to the background values. Microbiological investigations showed an increase in the number of microorganisms capable of forming gases from possible macrocomponents of the wastes and in the rate of sulfate reduction and methane generation processes within the propagation boundary of the wastes.

J	Janeschitz, G; Bahm, W				Janeschitz, G.; Bahm, W.			ITER, the "Broader approach", a DEMO fusion reactor	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article							CONSISTENT; TRANSPORT; MODEL	Fusion is a very promising future energy option, which is characterized by almost unlimited fuel reserves, favourable safety features and environmental sustainability. The aim of the worldwide fusion research is a fusion power station which imitates the process taking place in the sun and thus gains energy from the fusion of light atomic nuclei. The experimental reactor ITER which will be built in Cadarache, France, marks a breakthrough in the worldwide fusion research: For the first time an energy multiplication factor of at least 10 will be achieved, the factor by which the fusion power exceeds the external plasma heating. Partners in this project are the European Union, Japan, the Russian Federation, USA, China, South Korea and India as well as Brazil as associated partner. This facility is supposed to demonstrate a long burning, reactor-typical plasma and to test techniques such as plasma heating, plasma confinement by superconducting magnets, fuel cycle as well as energy transition, tritium breeding and remote handling technologies. The next step beyond ITER will be the demonstration power station DEMO which requires further developments in order to create the basis for its design and construction. The roadmap to fusion energy is described. It consists of several elements which are needed to develop the knowledge required for a commercial fusion reactor. The DEMO time schedule depends on the efforts in terms of personnel and budget resources the society is willing to invest in fusion taking into account the long term energy supply and its environmental impact.

Estimating active bone marrow dose from occupational exposure to uranium at a former gaseous diffusion plant	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						bone marrow; dose; exposure; occupational; uranium	MORTALITY PATTERNS; MULTIPLE-MYELOMA; RADIOLOGISTS; THOROTRAST; LEUKEMIA	Active bone marrow absorbed doses were estimated for 581 workers as part of a nested case-control study of multiple myeloma mortality at the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant (K-25). Uranium urinalysis results obtained by fluorometric and gross alpha measurements were available for about 20% of the 581 study subjects. These data were used to determine intakes of uranium as a result of occupational exposure during operation of the K-25 facility. Uranium solubility was inferred from the observed urinary excretion rate, job titles, and department codes. Data suggest that most study subjects were exposed to uranyl fluoride, a relatively soluble uranium compound. The median cumulative bone marrow dose determined for subjects with bioassay data was 0.06 mGy with a geometric standard deviation of 4.48. Subjects without bioassay data were assigned cumulative bone marrow dose based upon job titles and department codes.

Poisson-based detection limit and signal confidence intervals for few total counts	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						detection limits; statistics; counting efficiency; detector; radiation	LOW-LEVEL RADIOACTIVITY; STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS	An alternative to the accepted method for calculating detection limits is presented that avoids difficulties often encountered with few total counts. In particular, excessive false positives and large relative uncertainty in the signal determination are prevented. The usually accepted method did not fully incorporate Poisson statistics in the derivation of detection limits. The alternate method defines detection at the same relative uncertainty for all magnitudes of total counts and includes the uncertainty of the signal counts. A method of determining confidence intervals for the signal in the presence of background is also proposed. Use of the confidence interval method to determine the mode or most probable value is particularly useful at few total counts because negative signal results are avoided.

J	Leonard, BE				Leonard, Bobby E.			Examination of underground miner data for radon progeny size reduction as cause of high radon "inverse" dose rate effect	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						lungs; human; radon; uranium mines; health effects	DIFFUSION-COEFFICIENT; UNATTACHED FRACTION; SURFACE DEPOSITION; DECAY PRODUCTS; AIR; DISTRIBUTIONS; ATMOSPHERES; DAUGHTERS; HUMIDITY; MODEL	Radon progeny measurements of particle size distributions show that at high radon levels the distributions decrease in arithmetic mean diameters (AMD)-apparently due to increased neutralization rates affected by high radon concentrations. The radon concentration threshold for this diameter decrease effect (enhanced deposition effect, EDE), decreases with increased humidity. From graded screen array measurements, in a test chamber the AMD's are known vs. radon concentration. Knowing all the necessary parameters and using the ICRP 66 human respiratory tract model, the reduction in human lung dose rate per unit radon concentration was computed to be a factor of 2.5 in the test chamber. Supported by other work, this implies that the underground miners must experience a similar lung dose reduction. A prior estimate of a factor of 4 was obtained for the miners, but with only an estimate of the crucially important mine humidity distributions. Here a re-evaluation, using more realistic values for a representative mine work area surface to volume ratio and using in-mine measured humidity data at 108 mine work locations in 15 different mines, the re-computed estimate for the EDE miner lung dose rate reduction was 4.3. Analyzing separately in-mine data in unventilated locations finds a greater transition rate of the EDE lung dose reduction. These results are affirmed by measured mine progeny to radon concentration ratios, mine deposition rates and miners' individual work shift exposures at the North Alice, Utah mine. In comparing our data with other radon "inverse" dose rate effect (IDRE) data, a significant portion of the IDRE must be from reduction in lung dose from this EDE and not from decreased lung cancer incidence per progeny lung dose. We offer the only currently plausible answer for IDRE. This does not negate any bystander effects at the very low radon concentrations where other data are least accurate.

With the careful control of the growth parameters thick single crystal CdTe epilayers of high-crystalline quality were grown directly on the (211) Si substrates in a metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy. The heterojunction diode was fabricated by growing a 5 mu m thick n-type CdTe buffer layer on the n(+) -Si substrate, followed by the growth of 100 pm thick undoped p-CdTe layer. The diode fabricated showed very good rectification property with a low value of the reverse bias leakage current, typically 1.26 x 10(-7) A/cm(2) for an applied reverse bias of 60 V. The diode clearly demonstrated the gamma radiation detection capability by resolving energy peaks from the Am-241 radioisotope during the radiation detection test performed at room temperature.

Examination of count-starved gamma spectra using the method of spectral comparison ratios	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						anomaly detection; gamma-ray spectral analysis; gamma-ray spectroscopy; radiation monitoring		We discuss the determination of energy region (bin) boundaries and decision metrics for gamma-ray spectra, acquired using a mid-resolution detector, that are useful for detecting illicit sources at low total counts. The bins are designed to produce the lowest minimum detectable counts, using a spectral comparison ratio technique at a given false-positive rate for a specified population of benign-source spectra. Spectra from the benign source population consist of observations taken by a detector on a moving vehicle, as would be obtained during a search for a missing or hidden source. Raw counts in bins are transformed into a vector of background-corrected count differences. Bin boundaries are determined to yield large values of a standardized length of this vector for benign-plus-benchmark sources by applying an optimization technique. The objective function includes penalties for overlap with the spectral features of naturally occurring radioactive materials. We compare estimated minimum detectable count values for such bins applied to depleted uranium and barium-133 sources with those based on gross counting, and we examine the effect of nuisance potassium-, radium- an thorium-dominated sources. Using this methodology, we demonstrate that energy bins may be chosen to be sensitive to special nuclear materials, improving the likelihood of detection in low-count or masked-source searches.

J	Na, MG; Yang, HY				Na, Man Gyun; Yang, Heon Young			Power reconstruction of fuel rods by support vector regression for CANDU reactors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Canada deuterium uranium (CANDU) reactor; fuel rod power reconstruction; genetic algorithm; support vector regression (SVR).	NEURAL-NETWORK; FINITE-DIFFERENCE; CORE; DISTRIBUTIONS; MANAGEMENT; DESIGN; SYSTEM; FLUX	A support vector regression (SVR) model has been presented for reconstructing fuel,rod powers from Canada deuterium I uranium core calculations performed with a coarse-mesh finite difference diffusion approximation and single-assembly lattice calculations. The SVR is to nonlinearly map the original data into a higher dimensional feature space. Parameters related to the SVR are optimized by a genetic algorithm using the partial core calculation results of two 6 x 6 fuel bundle models (for training data). Verification has been conducted for two other partial core benchmark problems composed of 6 x 6 and 3 x 3 fuel bundles (for test data). The reconstructed fuel rod powers are compared with the reference solutions obtained with the,detailed collision probability calculations using the HELIOS lattice analysis code. It is known from simulation results that the proposed rod power reconstruction algorithm is accurate, yielding the error due to the reconstruction scheme of less than 0.35%.
