Intrinsic radioactivity of a Li6Eu(BO3)(3) crystal and alpha decays of Eu	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						alpha decays; Eu-151; Eu-152; Eu-153; Eu-154; neutron capture; Li6Eu(BO3)(3) crystal	DEPENDENT CLUSTER MODEL; EVEN-EVEN NUCLEI; HALF-LIVES; SUPERHEAVY NUCLEI; POTENTIALS; FORMULA; BISMUTH; LIFE	A small Li6Eu(BO3)(3) crystal (2.72 g) was measured deep underground at the Gran Sasso National Laboratories with a HP Ge detector of 408 cm(3) during 1500 h. While the crystal is not polluted by usual radioactive contaminants (only limits on the activity of U/Th chains, K-40 (CO)-C-60, Cs-137 were set on the level of 0.01-1 Bq/kg), the presence of radioactive Eu-152 and Eu-154 is evident, these are created in capture OK were set on the level of 0.01 1 of neutrons by naturally abundant 15 'Eu and 153 Eu. The measured activities correspond to 0.95 and 0.21 Bq/kg for 152 Eu and 154 Eu, respectively, with a ratio far from the standard expectation. As by-products, limits on half lives for the alpha decays Eu-151 -> Pm-147 (E-exe = 91.1 keV) and Eu-153 -> Pm-149 are determined as T-1/2 > 2.4 x 10(16) yr and T-1/2 > 1.1 X 10(16) yr, respectively.

Measurement of the shape-factor functions of the long-lived radionuclides Rb-87, K-40 and Be-10	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						radioactivity Rb-87 (beta); Be-10 (beta); K-40 (beta) analyzed beta-decay shape factors; measurement of beta spectra shape factors	ATOMIC MASS EVALUATION; HALF-LIFE; BETA-DECAY; STANDARDIZATION; EFFICIENCY; RAE; LSC	Accurate half-life values for both Rb-87 and K-40 are essential for geochronological purposes. In another context, the activity determination of the cosmogenic radioisotope Be-10 requires a better accuracy, too, so that the records of this radioisotope on the Earth's surface and inside meteorites can be interpreted. Liquid-scintillation counting is an excellent tool for carrying out precise beta-ray nuclide standardizations. However, the accuracy of the current standardization methods is frequently limited by the presence of inaccuracies in the shape-factor function. In this work, the shape-factor functions of Rb-87, K-40 and Be-10 are determined by experiment and compared with theoretical predictions. The measured shape-factor functions of Rb-87 and Be-10 were in good agreement with theory, but for K-40 some unexpected deviations were detected which make further investigations necessary.

Comparison of LaBr3 : Ce and NAI(Tl) scintillators for radio-isotope identification devices	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						lanthanum bromide; sodium iodide; scintillator; RIID; lanthanum-138; isotope identification	GAMMA-RAY SPECTROSCOPY; LACL3-CE; CONTAMINATION	Lanthanum bromide (LaBr3:Ce) scintillators offer significantly better resolution (< 3 percent at 662 keV) relative to sodium iodide (NaI(Tl)) but contain internal radioactivity that contributes to spectral counts. LaBr3:Ce has recently become available commercially in sizes large enough for the hand-held radio-isotope identification device (RIID) market. To study its potential for RIIDs, a series of measurements were performed comparing a 1.5 x 1.5-in. LaBr3:Ce detector with an Exploranium GR-135 RIID, which contains a 1.5 x 2.2-in. NaI(Tl) detector. Measurements were taken for short time frames and included examples of naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM), typically found in cargo, and special nuclear materials. To facilitate direct comparison, spectra from the different detectors were analyzed with the same isotope identification software (ORTEC ScintiVision (TM)). In general, the LaBr3:Ce detector was able to find more peaks and find them faster than the NaI(Tl) detector. To the same level of significance, the LaBr3:Ce detector was usually two to three times faster. The notable exception was for K-40-containing NORM where interfering internal activity due to La-138 in the LaBr3:Ce detector exists and NaI(Tl) consistently outperformed LaBr3:Ce.

Neutron detection in high gamma background using a micromegas detector	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						micromegas; photofission; radioactive waste characterization; neutron detection; gamma sensitivity		The ability of Micromegas to detect neutrons over a wide energy range has already been dernonstrated. However, in some nuclear experiments or applications, neutrons come with high photon flux disturbing the detectors. A new project for nuclear waste characterization using photonuclear reactions is under development at the CEA. One of the ideas is to detect the prompt neutrons produced by these kinds of reactions, which are accompanied by a strong gamma flash. The micromegas detector has been chosen to detect these neutrons since it is quite insensitive to gamma-rays under certain conditions.

Experimental results from an antineutrino detector for cooperative monitoring of nuclear reactors	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						nuclear reactor safeguards; antineutrino detection; gadolimum loaded liquid scintillator	NEUTRON-PRODUCTION; CONTAINMENTS; SIMULATION	Our collaboration has designed, installed, and operated a compact antineutrino detector at a nuclear power station, for the purpose of monitoring the power and plutonium content of the reactor core. This paper focuses on the basic properties and performance of the detector. We describe the site, the reactor source, and the detector, and provide data that clearly show the expected antineutrino signal. Our data and experience demonstrate that it is possible to operate a simple, relatively small, antineutrino detector near a reactor, in a non-intrusive and unattended mode for months to years at a time, from outside the reactor containment, with no disruption of day-today operations at the reactor site. This unique real-time cooperative monitoring capability may be of interest for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reactor safeguards program and similar regimes. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Specimens were fabricated as cubic polycrystals with the same composition for a given burnup. Each 300 mg specimen was irradiated in the HANARO research reactor for up to a 0.1 MWd/t U burnup. Post irradiation annealing tests were carried out at 1400 degrees C, 1500 degrees C and 1600 degrees C. The xenon diffusion coefficients for the SIMFUEL were lower than those for UO2 in near stoichiometric UO2 due to a relatively higher concentration of the tri-valent additives, which is related to the concentration of a cation vacancy. The activation energy in the SIMFUEL was also lower than that in UO2 due to the lower formation energy of a cation vacancy and the migration energy. The xenon diffusion coefficient for the SIMFUEL increased with an increasing oxygen potential of the ambient gas. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Mohankumar, N				Mohankumar, N.			On the numerical solution of radioactivity migration in a porous medium	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								The deep burial of vitrified radioactive waste in rock and the storage of spent fuel rods in storage tanks at sufficient depths call for the modeling of the migration of radioactivity in rock. Rock is considered as a system of connected parallel fractures. The two coupled partial differential equations which govern the transport in the fracture and in the porous matrix need to be solved by an efficient numerical procedure. Here, we indicate an accurate scheme that has the following two components. The first is the use of a very high order derivative approximation for the concentration gradient at the interface of the waste-matrix and the fracture. The second is the use of Crank-Nicolson finite difference scheme and this gives numerical values which are second order accurate both in space and time variables. With this prescription, reliable estimates of the concentration can be obtained at a distance of 500 in from the source for both long lived and short lived species. Typical concentration plots for few important species are provided. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	El-Morshdy, SED				El-Morshdy, Salah El-Din			Analytical study of the closure flow inside the ETRR-2 core chimney	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								The present work is carried out in order to study the closure flow inside the core chimney of the Egypt second research reactor (ETRR-2). Based on the finite difference technique, a two dimensional model is developed to simulate the coolant flow inside the chimney. The model is verified by FEHT finite element program. Then a study of different closure flow values inside the chimney was made using the developed model where a flow maps is plotted showing the stagnation depth for each closure flow. The flow maps shows that for a closure flow greater than 0.16 m(3)/h, no radioactive water ascends from the core to the pool through the chimney. The model results are analyzed and discussed.

Losses of polonium may occur at temperatures above 100 degrees C, depending on conditions, requiring particular care in sample preparation and treatment. In spite of this problem, the analysis of Po-210 is relatively straightforward, due to the ease of source preparation through spontaneous auto-deposition onto metal surfaces and the uncomplicated a spectrum. Although several optimisation studies have been carried out, published source preparation methods remain remarkably diverse. Some areas where further study would be useful are identified.

In this paper, we reported the synthesis of tritium-labeled PE2I, as well as improvements in the preparation of its acid precursor and PE2I itself with significant improvement in the total yield compared to previously published results. The new radioligand was evaluated as a tool for assessing DA(T) binding sites in vitro. The radioligand binding to mice striatal membranes demonstrated a homogeneous population of DA(T) binding sites with the K-d value 9 nM. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Currently, the widely used dose calibrator assay of Y-90 can have uncertainties exceeding +/- 10%. A non-destructive assay using spectroscopy is possible by reducing the currently published uncertainty (+/- 12%) in the internal pair production branching ratio for the 0(+)-0(+) transition of Zr-90. A high-purity germanium detector was used to determine the branching ratio to be (31.86 +/- 0.47) x 10(-6). (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Production cross-sections of Re181-186 isotopes from proton bombardment of natural tungsten	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						tungsten; rhenium; radioisotopes; cross-section; nuclear reaction	CARRIER-ADDED RE-186; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; COLON-CANCER; RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY; HEAD; NECK	Cross-sections for the production of Re-181, Re-182m, Re-182g, Re-183, Re-194, and Re-186 from proton bombardment of natural tungsten have been measured using the stacked foil technique for proton energies up to 17.6 MeV. Results are compared with the theoretical excitation functions as calculated by the EMPIRE II code (version 2.19) and experimental literature values. Results are in strong agreement with some of the previously reported literature as well at theoretical calculations for multiple reactions providing for more reliable estimates for the W-186 (p, n) Re-186 reaction.

Natural radioactivity measurement in pumice samples used raw materials in Turkey	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						radioactivity concentration; radium equivalent; health hazard indices; radium; thorium; potassium; gamma-ray spectrometer; pumice	BUILDING-MATERIALS	The activity concentrations of Th-232, Ra-226, and K-40 in different pumice samples have been determined by high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometry using a 110% HpGe detector. The radium equivalent activities (Ra-eq), external hazard index (H-in), and internal hazard index (H-in) associated with the natural radionuclides and representative level index (I-yr) are calculated to assess the radiation hazard of the natural radioactivity in the pumice samples. The mean values of the measured radioactivity concentrations of Th-232, Ra-226, and K-40 for pumice samples from the region of lakes (ROL) are 232.4 +/- 8.0, 196.9 +/- 7.8, and 1325.8 +/- 20.4Bq kg(-1) and for pumice samples from Cukurova region (CR) 16.3 +/- 4.0, 16.1 +/- 4.9, and 479.7 +/- 170.4Bq kg(-1), respectively. The calculated Ra-eq values vary from 435.9 +/- 12.5 to 883.6 +/- 41.5 Bq kg(-1) with a mean of 630.9 +/- 20.2 Bq kg(-1) for the ROL samples and from 49.7 +/- 3.3 to 101.9 +/- 7.2 Bq kg(-1) with a mean of 76.3 +/- 23.7 Bq kg(-1) for the CR samples. For the ROL samples, Ra-eq are above the limit of 370 Bq kg(-1), equivalent to external gamma dose of 1.5 mSv yr(-1), recommended for the safe use of construction materials by NEA-OECD, while for the CR samples, Ra-eq values are lower than the limit.

The procedure used to extract Se from the complex sample solution consisted in liquid-liquid extraction and ion exchange chromatographic methods. The concentration of Se-79 was measured using ICP-MS coupled with electro-thermal vaporisation to eliminate potential isobaric interferences. The activity was measured using LSC after gamma-ray spectrometry to check the contribution of residual radioactive contaminants.

Fuel utilization in VVER-1000: Status and prospects	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The status and prospects for increasing the fuel utilization efficiency of VVER-1000 reactors are reviewed. It is shown that the main trends in the development of water moderated and cooled reactors are reflected in an improved design with a four-year fuel run, different variants of which are now being implemented in nuclear power plants operating in Russia, Ukraine, and Bulgaria: weakly neutron-absorbing materials are used in the fuel assemblies, part of the excess reactivity of the core is compensated by an absorber (gadolinium) which is integrated with the fuel, the fuel load is designed with a reduced radial neutron leakage, and the number of refuelings is increased. Promising directions for improving fuel utilization are noted: increasing the energy content of the fuel load, operating the reactor with reduced values of the parameters at the end of a run after the reactivity excess has been exhausted on burnup, and reusing (recycling) the uranium and plutonium contained in the spent fuel.

J	Hohlefelder, W				Hohlefelder, W.			Opening address, 2007 winter meeting	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Editorial Material								Even more so than last year, energy policy is at the very top of the political agenda. The European Commission presented its strategy paper on "One Energy Policy for Europe," and another energy summit will be held in Germany to pave the way for an energy concept. As far as nuclear power is concerned, the EU Commission clearly and soberly emphasized today's contribution of nuclear power in the EU and, above all, the chances of further expanding the use of nuclear power in the interest Of CO2 avoidance, security of supply, and competitiveness. This makes a reassessment of nuclear power also a matter of national interest. The repository problem can be solved in Germany, provided there is the political will to do so. The sequence of steps leading to a solution is outlined precisely in the so-called Understanding on Nuclear Power of 2001. According to a ruling by the Luneburg higher administrative court, Konrad, the repository for low-level radioactive waste, can now be expanded and commissioned. There are no objections to the further exploration of Gorleben salt dome as a repository for high-level radioactive waste. In the course of the energy summit, an open, unbiased discussion about the reassessment of nuclear power must be started. No facts must be created prematurely, such as shutdowns of nuclear power plants. Applications for transfers of electricity quotas for older nuclear power plants are legitimate and correct. The German Atomic Energy Act contains express provisions for this possibility. There is no way past a basic reassessment of nuclear power. It has to be conducted now.

Optimized direct disposal of spent fuel by canister storage in boreholes	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								Nuclear industry designed a fuel rod canister for spent fuel elements in an effort to optimize emplacement technologies for both types of radioactive waste generating heat, i.e. spent fiiel elements and waste arisings from reprocessing. This so-called BSK-3 canister has the same diameter as a HLW canister and is to accommodate three PWR fuel elements. The possibility to handle in one single emplacement system all repository storage casks generating heat is expected to produce benefits in terms of time and expense. The appropriate emplacement technique is being developed and tested by DBE TECHNOLOGY GmbH within a research and development project on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economics and Technology and the EU Commission with the support of German nuclear industry. Challenging demands arise with respect to the technology of handling systems, for instance, from the length of BSK-3 (approx. 5 m) and its mass (approx. 5.2 t). The main facilities to be developed from scratch for this purpose are a transfer cask, a platform car, an emplacement device, and a borehole lock. In addition, there is a battery loco of the kind used in mining, which is still available from earlier projects. The functions and designs of the components and of the entire emplacement system are described and illustrated. The test program for full-scale demonstration of the emplacement technology and for verification of systems reliability will be conducted in a former turbine hall of E.ON at Landesbergen.

The waste management industry in the United Kingdom is undergoing a fundamental change. Belgium and France have taken far-reaching decisions about the management of radioactive waste. Germany is confronted with important decisions about waste management. The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Dr. Mohamed El Baradei, is in favor of multinational repositories. These are only some of the issues prevailing at the time of the Forum. The Forum, which was attended by 400 persons, included presentations at these four specialized seminars: Safety of nuclear installations. Waste management and the environment. Radiation protection. Security of nuclear materials and plants. The EUROSAFE Forum is organized by these 3 technical safety institutions: Gesellschaft ftir Anlagen- und Reaktorsicherheit (GRS), histitut de Radioprotection et de Surete Nucleaire (IRSN, France), and Association Vincotte Nucleaire A VN, Belgium). These organizations invite participants to Berlin for the next meeting, which is to be held on November 5-6, 2007.

Development of a portable system for checking radioactive sources using long wave radio frequency identification	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						computers; radiation, nonionizing; radiofrequency; radioisotope		A portable system for automatically checking radioactive sources stored in lead containers at low temperatures was developed in order to prevent the discharging of orphan sources and contaminated materials from a controlled area to the general public. A radio frequency identification (RFID) system using a long wave in a frequency range of 125 kHz was composed of identification tags, a reader, a notebook computer, and software. ID tags without batteries were devised by using integrated circuits with an electrically erasable programmable read-only memory of 250 bytes and antennas. This software consisted of operating and maintenance functions. The read range of the ID tags was adjusted to around 5 cm in order to avoid accidental contamination and for discriminating the multiple sources. A water layer of 6.9 cm had no influence on communication between the ID tags and the reader. The data of the ID tags stored at +4, -20, and -80 degrees C were precisely read 4 mo later. The influence of lead was completely removed by separating the ID tags more than 1.6 cm from the lead. A reader can exactly identify the data of the ID tags within 6.0 cm at a velocity less than 9.0 cm s(-1). Performance of the software was verified using mock data. Nine lists concerning registered, disposed, and missing sources, etc., were displayed on the computer monitor and printed out. An RFID system using long waves proved to be applicable for routinely checking radioactive sources.

The scraps resulting from the decommissioning of LINAC-ADONE have been temporarily stored in the same Frascati laboratory, waiting for definitive disposal. Relying on recommendations of the IAEA, European Commission and Italian committees, an experimental characterization study of the LNF repository was performed. The main objective was a classification of the scraps on the basis of internationally recognized "clearance levels," which are 0.1 Bq g(-1) for the isotopes of interest for this work. Secondly, a measurement of the materials suspected to be above 0.1 Bq g(-1) was planned. Activation isotopes were expected from the aluminum, copper, steel, and iron of the LINAC and the ADONE ring sections. For screening purposes, the repository area has been divided into zones, where in-situ measurements with a portable HP-Ge detector have been performed. In addition, small samples have been cut from a representative number of pieces, and accurate laboratory measurements have been made with a low background HP-Ge spectrometer. The experimental results are in good agreement with other studies and show that a large part of the material is below the mentioned specific activity level.

Effect of windows and doors on the gamma shielding factor for typical houses in Brazil	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						accidents, nuclear; attenuation; computer calculations; contamination, external	RATE CONVERSION FACTORS; EXPOSURE; SOIL	This study aims to determine the effect of windows and doors on shielding factors, defined as the ratios of the air kerma indoor to the air kerma in an open field, for typical building materials used in the southeast of Brazil due to radioactive material deposited on the surrounding field, walls, and ceiling external surfaces. The MCNP5 Monte Carlo radiation transport code was used in the simulation of photon shielding. The air kerma indoors for monoenergetic photons of 300 keV, 662 keV, and 3,000 keV has been determined for three different housing patterns, ranging from a poorly constructed house, at a density thickness of 5.5 g cm(-2) for the walls, to a well-constructed house, at a density thickness of 13.1 g cm(-2) for the walls, both with and without the presence of windows and doors. The shielding factor for the poorly constructed house type at an incident photon energy of 300 keV was found to be twice that of the well-constructed house type for the same energy. The presence of windows and doors showed very little or no significant increase on the shielding factors for the building materials studied. The maximum increase was found to be 9% for the well-constructed house type at a incident photon energy of 300 keV.

There have been no substantive studies of radionuclides in marine fishes and birds in the area since the mid-1970's. In this study, levels of Co-60, Eu-52, Sr-90, Tc-99, I-129, Cs-137, and the actinides (Am-241, Pu-238, Pu-239,Pu-240, U-234, U-236, U-236, and U-238) were studied in ten marine fish species (including Pacific Cod Gadus macrocephalus and Pacific Halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis) and five marine bird species (including Glaucous-winged Gulls Larus glaucescens, Tufted Puffins Fratercula cirrhata, and Common Eider Ducks Somateria mollissima) from Amchitka. The same species were collected at a reference site, Kiska Island (52 degrees N lat; 177 degrees E long), about 130 km west of Amchitka. Each sample was a composite of edible muscle from five or more individual fish or birds of similar size (+/- 15%) from the same sampling station. The null hypotheses of no differences among species or between Amchitka and Kiska were tested. Most analytic results were below the minimum detectable activity (MDA), even when 1,000 g sizes and 72 h counting times were used. The only radionuclides detected above the MDA were Cs-137, Am-241, Pu-239,Pu-240, U-234, U-235, and U-238. There were significant differences in Cs-137 as a function of species, but not location, for top predatory fishes. Of the fishes, eight of ten species had Cs-137 values above the MDA for some samples; only one bird, Glaucous-winged Gull, had Cs-137 values above the MDA. The highest concentrations of Cs-137 were in Dolly Varden [Salvelinus manna. 0.780 (Bq kg(-1) wet weight)] and Pacific Cod (0.602 Bq kg(-1)). In aggregate for any actinides, 73 of 234 (31%) composites for fish were above the MDA, compared to only 3 of 98 (3 %) for birds. U-234 and U-238, radionuclides that are primarily natural in origin, were routinely detected in these biological samples, but there were no significant differences in mean concentrations between Amchitka and Kiska. The concentrations of all radionuclides examined at Amchitka are similar to those of other uncontaminated Northern Hemisphere sites, and are lower than those reported for fishes and birds from the Irish Sea in the vicinity of the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing facility, an area with known contamination.

J	Soba, A; Denis, A				Soba, A.; Denis, A.			An interdiffusional model for prediction of the interaction layer growth in the system uranium-molybdenum/aluminum	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							DIFFUSION	The codes PLACA and DPLACA, elaborated in this working group, simulate the behavior of a plate-type fuel containing in its core a foil of monolithic or dispersed fissile material, respectively, under normal operation conditions of a research reactor. Dispersion fuels usually consist of ceramic particles of a uranium compound in a high thermal conductivity matrix. The use of particles of a U-Mo alloy in a matrix of Al requires especially devoted subroutines able to simulate the growth of the interaction layer that develops between the particles and the matrix. A model is presented in this work that gives account of these particular phenomena. It is based on the assumption that diffusion of U and Al through the layer is the rate-determining step. Two moving interfaces separate the growing reaction layer from the original phases. The kinetics of these boundaries are solved as Stefan problems. In order to test the model and the associated code, some previous, simpler problems corresponding to similar systems for which analytical solutions or experimental data are known were simulated. Experiments performed with planar U-Mo/Al diffusion couples are reported in the literature, which purpose is to obtain information on the system parameters. These experiments were simulated with PLACA. Results of experiments performed with U-Mo particles disperse in Al either without or with irradiation, published in the open literature were simulated with DPLACA. A satisfactory prediction of the whole reaction layer thickness and of the individual fractions corresponding to alloy and matrix consumption was obtained. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Embrittlement susceptibility induced by impurities segregation to grain boundaries in martensitic steels candidates to be used in ADS	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							LOW-ALLOY STEELS; TEMPER EMBRITTLEMENT; PHOSPHORUS; MOLYBDENUM; BEHAVIOR	Grain boundary microchemical characterization, by Auger electron spectroscopy, has been performed in the martensitic steel EM-10 doped with relevant spallation elements that are expected to be produced at the spallation target window in future Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS). A heat treatment of step-cooling was performed in all doped materials to accelerate impurity segregation. The results indicate that step-cooling promotes chromium and molybdenum enrichment at the grain boundaries in the four materials studied. Step-cooling promotes phosphorus segregation to grain boundaries in the reference material, in the material doped with titanium, and in the material doped with titanium, phosphorus and sulphur. Step-cooling also promotes titanium enrichment in the materials doped with this element. A relation among chromium, molybdenum and phosphorus has been observed in the alloy doped with titanium, phosphorus and sulphur suggesting co-segregation of these elements to grain boundaries or segregation of phosphorus at the interface of the matrix and the carbides rich in chromium and molybdenum.

Measurement of the specific heat of Zr-40 wt%U metallic fuel	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article								The specific heat capacities of un-irradiated and irradiated metallic Zr-40 wt%U fuel have been measured between 50 degrees C and 1000 degrees C with a differential scanning calorimetry. The irradiated fuels have three different burnup levels of 0.38, 0.70 and 0.92 g-fission product (FP)/cm(3). The measured specific heat for the un-irradiated fuel is representative and consistent with the values estimated from the Neumann-Kopp rule. The irradiated fuels exhibited a complicated behavior of the heat capacities. The unique characteristics of the specific heat capacities can be explained by the recovery of radiation damage, the formation of fission gas bubbles and fission gas release, and a phase transition in the irradiated fuels. An examination of the microstructure revealed that multiple large bubbles were formed in the irradiated fuel during specific heat measurement. The measured specific heat is expected to enable us to estimate the stored energy in the metallic fuel during certain accident scenarios and to determine the thermal conductivity of zirconium-uranium metallic fuel.

Current light water reactors (LWRs) will be replaced by FBRs and FBR cycle will be established in the future considering the limited amount of uranium (U) resource. The introduction of FBRs requires plutonium (Pu) recovered from LWR spent fuel. The authors propose advanced system named "Flexible Fuel Cycle Initiative (FFCI)" which can supply enough Pu and hold no surplus Pu, can respond flexibly the future technical and social uncertainties, and can achieve an economical FBR cycle. FFCI can simplify the 2nd LWR reprocessing facility for Japan (after Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant) which only carries out U removal from LWR spent fuel. Residual "Recycle Material" is, according to FBRs introduction status, immediately treated in an FBR reprocessing to fabricate FBR fuel or temporarily stored for the utilization in FBRs at necessary timing. FFCI has high flexibility by having several options for future uncertainties by the introduction of Recycle Material as a buffer material between LWR and FBR cycles.

The concept airns at effective and flexible utilization of the uranium and plutonium resources through the Plutonium multiple recycling by the two stages. In the first stage, the FLWR core realizes a high conversion type core concept, which is basically intended to keep the smooth technical continuity from the current LWR and coming MOX-LWR technologies without significant gaps in technical point of view. The core in the second stage represents the Reduced-Moderation Water Reactor (RMWR) core concept, which realizes a high conversion ratio over 1.0, being useful for the long-term sustainable energy supply through the plutonium multiple recycling. The FLWR is a BWR-type reactor, and its core design is characterized by the short flat core, which consists of hexagonal- shaped fuel assemblies in the triangular-lattice fuel rod configuration with the highly enriched MOX fuel and Y-shaped control rods. The cores in both stages utilize the compatible and the same size fuel assemblies, and hence during the reactor operation period, the former concept can proceed to the latter in the same reactor system, corresponding flexibly to the expected change in the future circumstances of the natural uranium resource or establishment of an economical reprocessing technology of the MOX spent fuel. Detailed investigations have been performed on the core design, in conjunction with the other related studies, and the results obtained so far have shown the proposed concept is feasible and promising.

The relationship between the fuel performance and the fuel configurations has been investigated in terms of the TRISO packing fraction, diameter of the fuel kernel, fuel management, and moderating power of the fuel block. Both a typical low-enrichment uranium fuel (LEU) and a fuel made of transuranics (TRU) from LWR spent fuel are considered in this paper. It is shown that in order to obtain a long refueling cycle and a high burnup at the same time, the fuel loading needs to be increased together with the moderating power of the fuel block. Three ways are considered for a higher moderation of the fuel block: a larger pitch of the coolant hole pattern, an extra graphite thickness in the fuel block, and a higher graphite density. The impact of the increased pitch on the fuel temperature is also evaluated with a thermal analysis code. We have shown that long refueling cycles and high burnups can be achieved simultaneously for both LEU and TRU fuels.

In this study, vibro-packing experiments were carried out to investigate particle movernent during vibro-packing as well as particle distribution after the completion of vibro-packing. Non-spherical uranium dioxide particles and spherical metallic uranium particles were used to simulate mixed oxide particles and oxygen getter particles, respectively. These experiments revealed the following facts. It is important to prevent segregation by means of feeding each size of the fuel particles uniformly into a cladding tube in order to disperse oxygen getter particles uniformly. "Simultaneous feeding" with volumetric powder feeders is useful to realize the above.

Various fuel forms, geometries and production paths are being looked at. Within the FUJI collaboration program among Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA, former JNC), Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI, Switzerland) and Nuclear Research and Consultancy Group (NRG, the Netherlands) the production paths of plutonium and neptunium mixed oxide- (sphere-pac- and vipac-) particle fuels (20 wt% Pu, 5 wt% Np and 75 wt% U) are tested as well as the initial sintering and power-to-melt behavior under simulated Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR) conditions. The various fuel forms were produced at PSI under the support of JNC, the irradiations were accomplished at High Flux Reactor (HFR) in Petten, the post irradiation examinations are being achieved mainly at NRG and the fuel modelling being performed at JNC and PSI. The present paper reviews mainly the project planning, fuel behaviour-pre-calculations and the fuel- and fuel segment-production. A short overview of the irradiation conditions and ceramographic post irradiation examination analyses is also given.

They are compatible with the use of centrifugal contactors and laboratory scale flowsheet trials with aceto-hydroxamic acid have demonstrated high actinide recoveries and decontamination factors on products for active feeds of up to 40wt.% Pu. They therefore show many ideal characteristics for Pu and Np recovery within flowsheet options for actinide recovery in advanced fuel cycles. Furthermore, in order to optimize the routing of Np with the Pu product in advanced flowsheets, additional studies of Np extraction in the primary co-decontamination contactor, prior to U/Pu partition, have been undertaken, combining experiment, modelling and flowsheet tests.

In this process, a large part of U is separated from dissolver solution by crystallization as UO2(NO3)(2).6H(2)O. The U crystallization test was carried out with real dissolver solution of irradiated FR fuel to investigate the influence of cooling rate on the crystal size and the behavior of fission product (FP) compared with that of Pu(IV). In regard to the influence of the cooling rate, it was confirmed that the crystal size was smaller as the cooling rate is faster. Although it was expectable that the decontamination performance was improved by diminishing, the specific surface of the crystals, it was suggested that a large crystal produced by crystallization was not always high purity. Concerning the behavior of FPs, Eu behaved similarly to Pu(IV). Cs accompanied with U into the crystals under the condition in this test.

On the MOX co-deposition process, the main process of that method, some fundamental experiments have been performed to confirm its feasibility. In the experiments, several parameters were set to study the suitable electrolysis condition to obtain desired granule of MOX. The concentrations of uraniurn, plutonium, fission products(FP)) simulators, and corrosion products(CP) simulators were adopted as the parameters. The blowing gas composition (O-2, Cl-2, Ar) during the electrolysis was also set as the variable condition. Through these experiments, it was clarified that the partial pressure of chlorine gas during electrolysis was important to obtain MOX granule with hi h Pu Concentration (about 30%) without generating bottom precipitation in melt, Finally, adequacy of the process control method for MOX co-electrolysis was confirmed through the test using spent fast reactor(FR) fuel.

Experiments on the precipitation behavior of Pu in HNO3 solution containing only Pit showed that both Pu(VI) and Pu(IV) were precipitated with NCP, but they required more NCP than in the U(VI) precipitation. Selective U(VI) precipitation from HNO3 solution containing U(VI) and Pu(IV) (U(Vl)-Pu(TV) solution) was achieved by stirring the solution for sufficient time after addition of NCP with ratio of [[NCP]/[U] = 1.4. Addition of an enough amount of NCP to U(Vl)-Pu(VI) or U(Vl)-Pu(IV) solutions gave a quantitative precipitation of both U and Pu. From a viewpoint of the physical property of the precipitate, Pu(VI) was found to be favorable for the U-Pu precipitation. Hence, we have studied the oxidation of Pu(IV) to Pu(VI). As a result, heating of the solution was found to be a promising method for the present process. Furthermore, it was clarified that neither Am(III) nor Np(V) was precipitated in the selective U precipitation and the simultaneous U-Pu precipitation. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the reprocessing by precipitation with NCP.

The process involves the conversion of oxide fuel to metal by electrolytic means, which would then enable subsequent separation and recovery of actinides via existing electrometallurgical technologies, i.e., electrorefining. Four electrolytic reduction runs were performed at bench scale using similar to 500 rnI of molten LiCI-1 wt% Li2O electrolyte at 650 degrees C. In each run, similar to 50g of crushed spent oxide fuel was loaded into a permeable stainless steel basket and immersed into the electrolyte as the cathode. A spiral wound platinum wire was immersed into the electrolyte as the anode. When a controlled electric current was conducted through the anode and cathode, the oxide fuel was reduced to metal in the basket and oxygen gas was evolved at the anode. Salt samples were extracted before and after each electrolytic reduction run and analyzed for fuel and fission product constituents. The fuel baskets following each run were sectioned and the fuel was sampled, revealing an extent of uranium oxide reduction in excess of 98%.

In the proposed process, spent nuclear fuels are dissolved in ILs by using C1(2) as an oxidant, and UO22+ and PuO22+ ions in ILs are recovered as UO2 and PuO2, by electrochemical reduction. In order to examine applicability of ILs as media for reprocessing, we have studied electrochemical behavior Of UO22+ in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BMICI), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIBF4), and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium nonafluorobutanesulfonate (BMINfO). Electrochemical properties of uranyl chloride dissolved into ILs were examined by cyclic voltammetry. In BMICI, an almost reversible redox couple was observed, and the formal potential and the diffusion coefficient were evaluated as -0.758 V vs. Ag/AgC1 and 4.8 x 10(-8) cm(2)center dot s(-1), respectively. On the other hand, the electrochemical reactions Of UO22+ in BMIBF4 and BMINfO were irreversible. In BMINfO, some reduction peaks and one sharp oxidation peak were observed in the range of -0.6 similar to-0.2V and around 0.85 V vs. Ag/AgC1, respectively. The reduction and oxidation peaks were assigned to multi step reduction of UO22+ to U(IV) via U(V) and/or direct reduction Of UO22+ to U(IV), and the oxidative dissolution of the resulting U(IV) compounds, respectively. The electrochemical reduction Of UO22+ in BMINfO at - 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCI produced the deposits on a carbon electrode as a cathode. Analyses of the deposits with the scanning electron microscope and the energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer indicated that the deposits are compounds containing uranium, oxygen, and chlorine. As a result, it is expected that the UO22+ in IL can be recovered electrolytically as uranium compounds such as UO2 and uranium oxychlorides.

Integrated experiments to demonstrate electrometallurgical pyroprocessing of PuO2 in continuous operation were carried out. In each test, 10-20g of PuO2, was reacted with Li reductant to form metal product. The reduction products were charged in an anode basket of the electrorefiner with LiCI-KCI-UCI3 electrolyte. Using the anode, deposition of uranium on the solid cathode was carried out when PUCI3/UCI3 concentration ratio was low. After the Pu/U ratio in the salt electrolyte was increased enough, Pu and U were recovered simultaneously on a liquid cadmium cathode. By heating up the deposits for distillation of the salt and the cadmium, U metal or Pu-U alloyed metal was obtained as residues in the crucible. It was the first result to demonstrate the recovery of metal actinides in the continuous operation of pyroprocessing of oxide fuels.

Presently the country has stepped into the 2nd Stage. The transition from the Stage 1 to 2 was fruitful thanks to the 2-decade long R&D experience gained in Fast Reactor Fuel Reprocessing (FRFR). Closing the fast reactor fuel cycle through FRFR was inevitable for the success of the Indian Nuclear Power Program (INPP). The latest achievement by the center was the successful reprocessing of 100GWd/t burnup mixed carbide fuel with 70% Pu, discharged from the Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR) which is also located in the same center. The designs of the various equipments and process flow sheet had stemmed from the above experiences thereby increasing the confidence level in the future plans of the Department. In this paper, an overview of the experiences in FRFR with glimpses of the various developmental activities towards the future plants is spelt out.

First, the amount and characteristics of HLWs caused from UO2 and MOX spent fuels of light-water reactors (LWR) were evaluated for various reprocessing schemes and cooling periods. The emplacement area in the repository site required for the disposal of these HLWs was then estimated with considering the temperature constrain in the repository. The results showed that, by recycling minor actinides (MA), the emplacement area could be reduced by 17-29% in the case Of UO2-LWR and by 63-85% in the case of MOX-LWR in comparison with the conventional PUREX reprocessing. This significant impact in MOX fuel was caused by the recycle of Am-241 which was a long-term heat source. Further 70-80% reduction of the emplacement area in comparison with the MA-recovery case could be expected by partitioning the fission products (FP) into several groups for both fuel types. To achieve this benefit of P&T, however, it is necessary to confirm the engineering feasibility of these unconventional disposal concepts.

From the start, the Commissariat l'Energie Atomique (CEA) has devoted considerable effort to the management of the back end of the cycle in order to extract the re-usable materials, uranium and plutonium, and to condition the resulting waste with the vitrification process. At the end of the December 1991 Waste Management Act, it is considered that partitioning techniques, which have been validated on real solutions with aqueous process, have been brought to a point where there is reasonable assurance that industrial deployment can be successful. For transmutation, CEA has conducted programs proving at lab scale the feasibility of the elimination of minor actinides and scenario studies have also allowed assessing the efficiency of transmutation in terms of the quantitative reduction of the final waste inventory depending on the reactor fleet of Pressurized Water Reactor-Fast Neutron Reactor-Accelerator Driven Systems (PWR-FR-ADS). For the future, the new Waste Management Act passed by the French Parliament on June 28, 2006, demands that Partitioning and Transmutation research continues in strong connection to GEN IV systems and ADS development, allowing to assess the industrial perspectives of such systems in 2012 and to put into operation a transmutation demo facility in 2020.

Impact on geologic repository usage from limited actinide recycle in pressurized light water reactors	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th GLOBAL International Conference 2005	OCT 09-13, 2005	Tsukuba, JAPAN			repository; actinide; decay; recycle; LWR; thermal; reactor; limited; continuous		A project has been conducted as part of the U.S. Department of Energy Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative to evaluate the impact of limited actinide recycling in light water reactors on the utilization of a geologic repository where loading of the repository is constrained by the decay heat of the emplaced materials. In this study, it was assumed that spent PWR fuel was processed, removing the titanium, plutonium, americium, and neptunium, along with the fission products cesium and strontium. Previous work had demonstrated that these elements were responsible for limiting loading in the repository based on thermal constraints. The plutonium, americium, and neptunium were recycled in a PWR, with process waste and spent recycled fuel being sent to the repository. The cesium and strontium were placed in separate storage for 100-300 years to allow for decay prior to disposal. The study examined the effect of single and mutliple recycles of the recovered plutonium, americium, and neptunium, as well as different processing delay times. The potential benefit to the repository was measured by the increase in utilization of repository space as indicated by the allowable linear loading in the repository drifts (tunnels). The results showed that limited recycling would provide only a small fraction of the benefit that could be achieved with repeated processing and recycling, as is possible in fast neutron reactors.

J	Ahn, J				Ahn, Joonhong			Deterministic assessment for environmental impact of Yucca Mountain Repository measured by radiotoxicity	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th GLOBAL International Conference 2005	OCT 09-13, 2005	Tsukuba, JAPAN			environmental impact; radiotoxicity; advanced fuel cycle; Yucca Mountain Repository; commercial spent nuclear fuel; defense waste		Environmental impact of the Yucca Mountain Repository (YMR) has been quantitatively and deterministically evaluated in terms of the radiotoxicity of transuranic (TRU) and fission-product radionuclides existing in the environment after released from failed packages. Inventory abstraction has been made based on the data published in Final Environmental Impact Statement by US Department of Energy (DOE). Mathematical model and computation code have been developed based on analytical solutions. Environmental impact from the commercial spent nuclear fuel (CSNF) packages is about 90% of the total impact including the contribution from defense waste (DW) packages. Impacts due to isotopes of Cm, Arn, Pu and Np, and their decay daughters are dominant, compared with those from fission-product nuclides. Numerical results show that reduction of the TRU nuclides by a factor of 100 makes the impact from CSNF smaller than that from DW.

It will be able to produce waste packages for final disposal and to reduce the volume of stored wastes by operating the AVRF. The AVRF consist of the Waste Size Reduction and Storage Facilities (WSRSF) and the Waste Volume Reduction Facilities (WVRF); the former has cutting installations for large size wastes and the latter has melting units and a super compactor. Cutting installations in the WSRSF have been operating since July 1999. Radioactive wastes treated so far amount to 750 m(3) and the volume reduction ratio is from 1.7 to 3.7. The WVRF has been operating with non-radioactive wastes since February 2003 for the training and the homogeneity investigation in the melting processes. The operation of the pretreatment system in the WVRF with radioactive wastes has partly started in FY2005.

In this study, a test of such technology was conducted in a full-scale simulated disposal drift, using a filling system which utilizes a screw conveyor system. The simulated drift, which contained two dummy overpacks, was configured as a half-cross-section model with a height of 2.22m and a length of 6.0m. The average dry density of the buffer obtained in the test was 1.29 Mg/m(3), with an angle of repose of 35 to 40 degrees. These test results indicate that buffer construction using a screw conveyor system for pellet emplacement in a waste disposal drift is a promising technology for repositories for high level radioactive wastes.
