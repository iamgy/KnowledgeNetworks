J	Whitney, SM; Biegalski, S; Buchholz, B				Whitney, Scott M.; Biegalski, Steven; Buchholz, Bruce			Analyzing nuclear fuel cycles from isotopic ratios of waste products applicable to measurement by accelerator mass spectrometry	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							LEVEL; AMS	An extensive study was conducted to determine isotopic ratios of nuclides in spent fuel that may be utilized to reveal historical characteristics of a nuclear reactor cycle. This forensic information is important to determine the origin of unknown nuclear waste. The distribution of isotopes in waste products provides information about a nuclear fuel cycle, even when the isotopes of uranium and plutonium are removed through chemical processing. Several different reactor cycles of the pressurized water reactor, boiling water reactor, Canada deuterium uranium reactor, and liquid-metal fast breeder reactor were simulated for this work with the ORIGEN-ARP and ORIGEN2.2 codes. The spent-fuel nuclide concentrations of these reactors were analyzed to find the most informative isotopic ratios indicative of irradiation cycle length and reactor design. Special focus was given to long-lived and stable fission products that would be present many years after their creation. For such nuclides, mass spectrometry analysis methods often have better detection limits than classic gamma-ray spectroscopy. The isotopic ratios Sm-151/Sm-146, Sm-149/Sm-146, and Cm-244/Cm-246 were found to be good indicators of fuel cycle length and are well suited for analysis by accelerator mass spectroscopy.

High-performance annular fuel reactor physics and fuel management	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						annular fuel; neutronic analysis; pressurized water reactors	BURNUP	Compared to the traditional solid fuel pin, annular fuel with internal as well as external coolant flow increases the cooling surface by similar to 50%, which allows a higher core power density. However, operating at high power density introduces challenges in the core physics design of burnable poison to suit the desired fuel cycle length. In this paper, both the fuel cycle length and the number of reload fresh fuel assemblies are assumed to remain the same as current industry practice (18-month cycle and three-batch fuel management), which in turn requires > 5 wt% fuel enrichment for the 150% power core. Alternative fuel cycles are discussed. Pressurized water reactor cores with annular fuel are designed using the state-of-the-art Studsvik Scandpower core modeling package including CASMO-4, TABLES-3, and SIMULATE-3. Two power levels are considered for the core design based on annular fuel: 100 and 150% of the rated power. The reactivity feedback effects of the annular fuel are shown to be comparable to those of solid fuel. The 150% power core with annular fuel shows considerable resemblance to traditional high-energy cores.

Fertile-free annular fuel for plutonium recycling	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						annular fuel; fertile-free; transuranics recycling	INERT MATRIX FUEL	Up to 50% increase in the power density of the existing pressurized water reactor (PWR)-type reactors can be achieved by the use of internally and externally cooled annular fuel geometry. As a result, the accumulated stockpiles of Pu, especially if incorporated infertile-free inert matrix, can be burnt at a substantially higher rate as compared with the conventional mixed oxide-fueled reactors operating at standard power density. In this work, we explore the basic feasibility of a PWR core fully loaded with Pu incorporated infertile-free fuel of annular internally and externally cooled geometry and operating at 150% of nominal power density. We evaluate basic burnable poison designs, fuel management strategies, and reactivity feedback coefficients. The three-dimensional full core neutronic analysis performed with Studsvik Core Management System showed that the design of such a Pu-loaded annular fuel core is feasible but significantly more challenging than the Pu fertile-free core with solid fuel pins operating at nominal power density. The main difficulty arises from the fact that the annular fuel core requires at least 50% higher initial Pu loading in order to maintain the standard fuel cycle length of 18 months. Such a high Pu loading results in hardening of the neutron spectrum and consequent reduction in reactivity worth of all reactivity control mechanisms and, in some cases, positive moderator temperature coefficient (MTC). The use of isotopically enriched Gd and Er burnable poisons was found to be beneficial with respect to maximizing Pu burnup and reducing power peaking factors. Overall, the annular fertile-free Pit-loaded high-power-density core appears to be feasible, although it still has relatively high power peaking and potential for slightly positive MTC at beginning of cycle. However, we estimate that limiting the power density to 140% of the nominal case would assure acceptable core power peaking and negative MTC at all times during the cycle.

J	Lahoda, E; Feinroth, H; Salvatore, M; Russo, DO; Hamilton, H				Lahoda, Edward; Feinroth, Herbert; Salvatore, Marcelo; Russo, Diego O.; Hamilton, Holly			High-power-density annular fuel: Manufacturing viability	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						annular fuel; manufacture; production data		This paper summarizes the work performed to examine the feasibility of manufacturing internally and externally cooled annular fuel for high -power- density pressurized water reactors (PWRs) and to demonstrate commercially viable manufacturing processes at bench scale. Five different manufacturing processes were considered, and two were selected for further development and demonstration. These are (a) the traditional press and sinter technique currently used in solid pellet manufacture and (b) the vibration compaction (VIPAC) technique, in which granulated and sintered urania fuel particles are vibration compacted into a prefabricated annular space. Two separate pellet manufacturing trials were undertaken, one at the Westinghouse, Columbia, South Carolina, plant and one at INVAP facilities in Argentina. At the INVAP plant the pellets were loaded between small and large cladding tubes and seal welded to demonstrate the entire manufacturing steps. At Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, the VIPAC approach was used to perform short test segments as well as 1219-mm (4-ft)-long fuel rods. The overall conclusion of the work is that the press and sinter technique can produce annular pellets and annular fuel elements that meet the density and dimensional needs of the annular fuel design and hence is a viable approach toward fabrication of such high-power-density fuel. This process is most like that used in current commercial fuel production and hence would pose the least disruption in any future annular fuel use in commercial PWRs. This work also demonstrated that the VIPAC approach is capable of making highquality annular fuel elements, but not with the fuel density required for adequate performance. Addition of uranium metal powder to the vibrated compact was found to be necessary to achieve the required uranium fuel loading.

J	Lahoda, E; Mazzoccoli, J; Beccherle, J				Lahoda, Edward; Mazzoccoli, Jason; Beccherle, Julien			High-power-density annular fuel for pressurized water reactors: Manufacturing costs and economic benefits	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						annular fuel; manufacturing cost; power plant economics		Annular fuel can be used as a means to upgrade the power density in future and current reactors. This study determined the economic impact of the manufacturing and use of this higher energy density fuel. An evaluation of the manufacturing costs associated with annular fuel indicated that there should be minimal if any manufacturing cost impacts. While each rod would use more material (uranium and zirconium) than a standard solid-pellet-based fuel, fewer rods are required for each assembly. Several uprate options were compared to a new build of a Generation III 1117-MW(electric) plant (option 1) on the basis of rate of return (ROR) on investment, which was calculated at 6.9%. Option 2 was the uprate of an operating Generation II power plant from 1200 to 1800 MW(electric) including steam generator replacements, which resulted in an ROR of 6.3%. Option 2 was also evaluated assuming that a shutdown to upgrade was coordinated with a previously scheduled replacement of steam generators. Assuming that 3 of the 12 months required for uprating the plant are already paid for by the steam generator replacement, the ROR of this option then rises to 13. 0%, which makes it the best option available. Option 3 was the building of a new Generation III plant with an output of 1717 MW(electric) using annularfuel, which had an ROR of 11.5%. This was compared to a new 1717- MW(electric) Generation III plant with low energy density standard fuel, which yielded an ROR of 10. 8%. It was concluded that the use of annularfuel, when complemented with other changes in the fuel such as longer rod lengths, higher fuel density, and core reflectors that would increase the amount of fuel in the core and increase its neutron efficiency, could improve the rate of return on invested capital for new plants by getting more capacity from a smaller-sized nuclear island, which reduces the capital cost per installed kilowatt. Note that this study did take into account replacement power and unused fuel value at the time of transition from standard to annularfuel, but not costs associated with the changes required to the power system outside of the plant boundary, which would be site dependent. When replacement power and fuel displacement costs were not included, the ROR for the 600-MW(electric) uprate option 2 rose to H. 6%. This result indicates that large 50% uprates may make sense if low-cost replacement power during the transition outage is readily available and if a fuel management program before the uprate can minimize the residual value of the displaced standard fuel. It is also clear that with sufficient lifetime, uprating plants, regardless of the method used, results in better plant economics because of the economy of scale effect.

To accomplish this goal, a capabilily for modeling I&E cooled annular fuel has been developed for two manufacturing approaches: (a) the sintered and pressed pellet approach and (b) the vibrationally compacted (VIPAC) particle approach. New models for the bumup and power radial distribution, fuel thermal and irradiation dimensional changes as well as fuel-cladding interaction mechanisms for annular fuels have been developed and incorporated into a modified version of the FRAPCON code. Fission gas release from the sintered fuel is found to be lower for the same burnup than the traditional solid fuel but slightly higher for the VIPAC fuel. The VIPAC internal rod pressure, however, remains below that of the solid fuel for much higher burnup. The power density constraints and design limits are studied, as well as sensitivity of the annular fuel design to fabrication and operation uncertainties. It is concluded that such fuel can be operated at 30 to 50% higher core power density than the current operating light water reactors, and to a burnup of 80 to 100 MWd/kg U. The major issue for the pellet fuel rod design is the asymmetry in heat transfer that might develop when the outer gap is closed early in the irradiation due to the outward thermal expansion of the fuel. Solutions to this issue via smaller initial inner gap, small roughness and tolerances on fuel and clad surfaces, or the addition of a highly porous ZrO2 layer on the outer pellet surface are evaluated. The main issue for the VIPAC fuel is selection of the particle sizes, which control both the effective density of the fuel and the fission gas release.

Measurements are performed in thick PE irradiated with 5 MeV electron beams at doses of the order of tens of kGy. The irradiation modifies the PE molecules producing dehydrogenation, emission of different C-x-H-y groups, C-enrichment and carbon cross-linking processes. Results indicate that the radiation damage depends on the dose and that a significant change of chemical and physical polymer properties is reached for a critical dose of 18 kGy.

Estimation of Argon-41 concentrations in the vicinity of a high-energy medical accelerator	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article						Argon-41; indium foils; thermal neutron flux; neutron activation; medical accelerators	NEUTRON LEAKAGE; ELECTRON-ACCELERATOR; LINEAR-ACCELERATOR; FIELDS	This study presents the estimation of Ar-41 concentrations using the neutron activation method. The distribution of thermal neutron flux in a 15 MV medical accelerator (linac) treatment room was determined and contoured by measuring the radioactivities of indium foils irradiated by thermal neutrons. The Ar-41 concentrations were calculated based on the spatial distribution of thermal neutrons. The evolution of Ar-41 concentration with time in the treatment room was predicted and the corresponding radiation dose associated with Ar-41 was derived and shown to be insignificant for both patients and workers, being below the regulatory level. Indium foil activation method showed high detection sensitivity for estimating the low-level Ar-41 in the vicinity of medical accelerators, yielding a minimum detectable concentration of less than 10 Bq m(-3).

Radon emanation from phosphogypsum and related mineral samples in Cyprus	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article						radon; phosphogypsum; minerals; exhalation rates; radiological impact	BUILDING-MATERIALS; EXHALATION; RADIOACTIVITY	Radon emanation rates from phosphogypsum samples have been determined to assess the radiological impact of radon emanated from a phosphogypsum disposal site. For comparison corresponding measurements were conducted with samples of phosphate rock, fertilizer, natural gypsum, and calcite. The experimental data show that phosphate rock and phosphogypsum samples emanate radon in significantly higher rates (up to almost two orders of magnitude). The exhalation rates determined for samples obtained from a phosphogypsum stack in Cyprus range from 0.35 to 1.1 Bq h(-1). This, consequently, may result in increased radon levels in dwellings build and excessive radiation exposure to workers residing on the stack, which could reach in extreme cases values up to 17 mSv y(-1).

The values of Li subshell fluorescence yields (omega(1), omega(2) and omega(3)) have been determined using the presently measured X-ray production cross sections and the theoretical Li subshell photoionization cross sections values, Coster-Kronig transition probabilities and radiative emission rates. Furthermore, K to L shell vacancy transfer probabilities eta(KLi) (i = 1, 2, 3) for Sm, Eu, Gd, Dy, Ho, Er were determined by measuring the L X-ray production cross section and L subshell fluorescence yields. The measurements were performed using an Am-241 radioisotope as the photon source and a Si(Li) detector. The measured X-ray production cross sections, fluorescence yields and vacancy transfer probabilities were compared with the theoretical values. The results in the present paper are found to be in good agreement with the calculated values. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) was grafted onto the trunk polymer by pre-irradiation grafting technique. Grafting conditions were optimized, and GMA grafted PiBMA beads were modified with iminodiacetonitrile (IDAN) in ethanol at 80 degrees C. The nitrile groups were then amidoximated by using 6% (m/v) hydroxylamine hydrochloride in methanol solution. The MAN modification and the conversion of the nitrile groups to amidoxime were followed by FT-IR spectroscopy. The surface morphology and thermal behavior of the PiBMA and its modificated forms were also characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques further confirming modification and amidoximation.

Our table-top Compton camera consists of a double-sided silicon strip detector (5 x 5 x 0.15 cm(3), 16 x 16 strips) and a 25-segmented germanium detector (5 x 5 x 2 cm(3), 5 x 5 segments). In this study, the table-top Compton camera was optimized with the GEANT4 detector simulation toolkit in order to maximize its performance for F-18. The scatterer-to-absorber distance and scatterer-to-absorber angle were investigated for their utility as optimization parameters. Our results show that the optimal performance of the Compton camera is achieved when the scatterer and absorber are positioned in parallel and 7-13 cm apart. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

A methodology for the determination of the radionuclide contents and activity of samples	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Radiation Physics	SEP 17-22, 2006	Univ Coimbra, Coimbra, PORTUGAL		Univ Coimbra	eficiency; Monte Carlo; NaI; HPGe		gamma-Spectrometry has been used in the Department of Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety of ITN (the Nuclear and Technological Institute, in Lisbon, Portugal) to identify and quantify radionuclides in samples from radiological monitoring of radioactive waste discharges. Real samples from radiological monitoring are characterized by a range of different geometries and heterogeneous matrices, therefore, requiring a diversified range of calibration sources to correctly calibrate the measuring system. Moreover, there are cases when due to the geometry or type of matrix, none of the system calibrations is adequate to correctly measure the sample representing a major problem in the accurate determination of samples' radionuclide concentration. Two detection systems were used, one consisting of a 3" x 3" Nal(TI) detector and the other consisting of a HPGe5030. Both detection systems are complete by the associated shielding and calibration sources. The Monte Carlo method was used in support of a methodology to assess the radionuclide contents and activity of the real samples previously mentioned. The efficiency curves measured experimentally from three calibration sources were compared with the corresponding computational ones, obtained by Monte Carlo simulation in order to validate the method and providing the crucial tool needed to simulate any samples' geometry and matrices. The method is then used to analyze unknown samples with different matrix materials. Results from the measurements performed and their comparison with the computational results obtained are presented. Improvements in the understanding of the behavior of the experimental setup, namely the efficiency versus matrix material and geometry are explained. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The device combines a phoswich detector for alpha/beta/gamma ray recognition with a fast digital card for electronic pulse analysis. The detector is able to discriminate different types of radiation in a mixed alpha/beta/gamma field and can be used in a coincidence mode by identifying the composite signal produced by the simultaneous detection of P particles in a plastic scintillator and 7 rays in an NaI(TI) scintillator. Use of a coincidence technique with phoswich detectors was proposed recently to verify the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which made it necessary to monitor the low levels of xenon radioisotopes produced by underground nuclear explosions. Previous studies have shown that combining CaF2(Eu) for beta ray detection and NaI(TI) for gamma ray detection makes it difficult to identify the coincidence signals because of the similar fluorescence decay times of the two scintillators. With the device proposed here, it is possible to identify the coincidence events owing to the short fluorescence decay time of the plastic scintillator. The sensitivity of the detector may be improved by employing liquid scintillators, which allow low radioactivity levels from actinides to be measured when present in environmental samples. The device developed is simpler to use than conventional coincidence equipment because it uses a single detector and electronic circuit, and it offers fast and precise analysis of the coincidence signals by employing digital pulse shape analysis.

Calculation of calibration figures and the volume correction factors for Y-90, I-125, I-131 and Lu-177 radionuclides based on Monte-Carlo ionization chamber simulation method	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Radiation Physics	SEP 17-22, 2006	Univ Coimbra, Coimbra, PORTUGAL		Univ Coimbra	Monte-Carlo simulations ionization chamber; calibration figures; volume correction factors; impurity		Manv metrology laboratories are dealing with activity measurements of different radionuclides with special interest in nuclear medicine as well as in radiopharmaceutical industry. In improving the accuracy of radionuclide activity measurements, a key role plays the calculation of calibration figures and the volume correction factors for the radionuclide under study. It is well known that the chamber calibration factors depend on the measurement geometry including the volume of the source and the type of the measurement vessel. In this work, the activity standards in the form of radioactive solutions are delivered in sealed Jena glass 5 ml FIOLAX (R) -klar ampoule. Calculation of the calibration figures (or efficiencies) for Y-90, I-125, I-131 and (177) Lu radionuclides on 5 in] ampoule are presented in this paper. Additionally, their appropriate volume correction factors are determined. These calibration figures for the ISOCAL IV pressurized well re-entrant ionization chamber (IC) are pointed out based on the Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation method of such chamber using the PENELOPE-2005 MC computer simulation code. The chamber is filled with nitrogen gas pressurized to approximately 1 MPa. In determining the volume correction factors, the variation of calibration factors versus the mass of radioactive solution filling the 5 rut ampoule glass is investigated. From the point of view that impurity of 177 Lit isomer is always accompanying the 177 Lit radionuclide, for making possible the correction due to presence of this impurity, the calibration factor and the volume correction factors for (177)"'Lu are reported as well.

The source consists of Rh wire that has been irradiated in a 14 MeV cyclotron. A 22 keV X-ray emitter results from the (103) Rh(p,n) (103) Pd nuclear reaction. (103) Pd is currently widely used in brachytherapy. Thanks to physical differences in evaporation and melting temperature but also diffusion coefficients between 103 Pd and 103 Rh, 103 Pd is extracted from the raw material by dry distillation at high temperature (1000-1470 degrees C) and under vacuum (2 x 10(-5) mbar).

The main characteristic parameters of the core are: MOX fuel, k(eff) = 0.95, fission power 27.6 kW, Pb reflector. The SAD target consists of one central and 18 hexagonal (36 mm pitch) Pb prisms in two concentric layers. The main goal of the calculations, is the evaluation of the radiation hazard connected with replacement of the target elements after planned six months working period. The total induced radioactivity and its spatial distributions in the target elements were presented elsewhere. Here the longitudinal distribution and the time evolution of the gamma/beta emmiters activity, their spectra in the most active central target element and adequate radiation exposure are shown. The attenuation factors for these gamma ray spectra for commonly used shielding materials (Pb, Fe) are calculated as well. The MCNPX code is used for radioisotope production calculations. Gamma and beta spectra are calculated using modified EvIzo program and TORI database. Methods and tools used for gamma spectra simulation are checked using the results obtained in the experiment with bare Pb cylindrical target. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This calibration is performed using a standard solution containing gamma emitter sources. Nevertheless, the efficiency curves obtained are periodically checked using a source such as Eu-152 emitting many gamma rays that cover a wide energy range (20-1500keV). Eu-152 presents a problem because it has a lot of peaks affected by True Coincidence Summing (TCS). Two experimental measures have been performed placing the source (a Marinelli beaker) at 0 and 10 cm from the detector. Both spectra are simulated by the MCNP 4C code, where the TCS is not reproduced. Therefore, the comparison between experimental and simulated peak net areas permits one to choose the most convenient peaks to check the efficiency curves of the detector. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Monte Carlo simulation of beta-gamma coincidence system using plastic scintillators in 4 pi geometry	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Radiation Physics	SEP 17-22, 2006	Univ Coimbra, Coimbra, PORTUGAL		Univ Coimbra	Monte Carlo; coincidence; standardisation	STANDARDIZATION	A modified version of a Monte Carlo code called Esquema, developed at the Nuclear Metrology Laboratory in IPEN, Sao Paulo, Brazil, has been applied for simulating a 4 pi beta(PS)-gamma coincidence system designed for primary radionuclide standardisation. This system consists of a plastic scintillator in 4 pi geometry, for alpha or electron detection, coupled to a NaI(Tl) counter for gamma-ray detection. The response curves for monoenergetic electrons and photons have been calculated previously by Penelope code and applied as input data to code Esquema. The latter code simulates all the disintegration processes, from the precursor nucleus to the ground state of the daughter radionuclide. As a result, the curve between the observed disintegration rate as a function of the beta efficiency parameter can be simulated. A least-squares fit between the experimental activity values and the Monte Carlo calculation provided the actual radioactive source activity, without need of conventional extrapolation procedures. Application of this methodology to Co-60 and Ba-133 radioactive sources is presented and showed results in good agreement with a conventional proportional counter 4 pi beta(PC)-gamma coincidence system.

Since the alpha particles have short ranges (similar to 40 mu m), it is necessary to have superheated liquid droplets in the closest vicinity of the alpha emitting radionuclide to detect alpha events quantitatively. The inherent ability of SET in discriminating alpha events from beta and gamma events makes it very useful technique in terms of ease and duration of analysis. The results obtained for analysis of uranium, thorium and plutonium are presented in this paper. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To solve these problems, a complex calibration of the system is required. An experimental calibration using the shell-sources method was performed in order to determine the efficiency appropriate for a uniformly distributed source. For this purpose, a calibration drum filled with Portland cement and provided with seven tubes, placed at different distances from its center was used. Monte Carlo calculations using the GESPECOR software were carried out in order to complement experimental calibration. Thus, efficiency values for different geometries were obtained and compared with the experimental values. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Monte Carlo simulation of portal detectors of a steel factory. Comparison of measured and simulated response	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Radiation Physics	SEP 17-22, 2006	Univ Coimbra, Coimbra, PORTUGAL		Univ Coimbra	Monte Carlo; portal; simulation; organic scintillators; response; scrap metal		Metal scrap is widely used in steel production. Millions of tons of scrap metal are traded each year worldwide; hence, both national and international authorities have shown an increasing interest in the probing and detection of radioactivity contamination in scrap metal. In order to minimize and/or avoid economical losses and material contamination, portal monitors have been installed at the entrance point of installations of many steel industries. Portal monitors typically consist of large organic scintillation detectors. The purpose of this study is to simulate such detectors and compare simulation results with experimental measurements in order to understand. calibrate and effectively use the detectors' response. Monte Carlo simulations of these systems demonstrate the assumptions that have to be made for optimal matching of measured and simulated results. As it was reported in previous studies, we observed a difference between measured and experimental values next to the light guide. In this work, we propose a transition area near the boundary surface of the scintillator and the light guide; this results in a good qualitative and quantitative agreement of measured and simulated results. This study will also define a guideline for later portal monitor simulations and a reliable estimation of the portals' efficiency. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Feasibility of using proportional gas counters as a primary standard for positron emitters in gas	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Radiation Physics	SEP 17-22, 2006	Univ Coimbra, Coimbra, PORTUGAL		Univ Coimbra	primary standard; proportional counters; positron emitters; PET; PENELOPE	C-11	The increasing usage of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has resulted in the commissioning of new cyclotron facilities. Emissions from exhaust ducts at these facilities are continuously monitored for radioactivity in order to ensure compliance with regulations. A primary standard for positron emitters in gas is essential to ensure the accuracy and traceability of these measurements. Up to now, all the primary standardisations for positron emitters have been carried out on liquid or solid sources; there is no primary calibration facility for the instrumentation used to monitor the radioactive effluent from the PET/cyclotron sites. A system of gas flow proportional counters, already established at NPL for calibration of beta(-) emitters, will be the basis of the primary standard. This paper focuses on the calculation of positron energy deposition in proportional counters, and how this differs from electron energy deposition in order to predict the counters response. The PENELOPE Monte Carlo code has been used to study the energy deposition of positrons arising from the radionuclides (11)c, N-13, O-15 and F-18 in a P10 gas for each of the three counters. and how these differ from energy depositions of electrons of the same energy at a pressure of 725 mmHg and temperature of 20.2 degrees C. The positrons were found to deposit from around 1.5 to 2.5 times more energy than electrons to the gas per primary shower depending on the maximum energy of the positron, affecting the minimum detectable activity concentration limit of the counters to positrons.

One of these networks consists of NaI(T1) detectors that measure air Kinetic Energy Release in a MediA (KERMA). Located beside the NaI(T1) detector in Ottawa is a radioxenon analyzer, that measures the activity concentration of Xe-131m,Xe-133m,Xe-133,Xe-135 directly. The International Commission on Radiological Units (ICRU) accepted KERMA to activity concentration conversion factor for Xe-133, for a semi-infinite cloud measured I m off the ground, is 9.68 pGy/h perBq/m(3). However, after averaging many observations, the two detectors in Ottawa reported a conversion value of 2.6 +/- 0.2 pGy/h perBq/m(3). This study focuses on the interpretation of the NaI(T1) detector. Two methods employing the Monte Carlo simulation were used in this investigation. The first is a brute force method in which simulations are used to model a detector immersed in a semi-infinite radioactive source. No Monte Carlo variance reduction techniques other than photon forcing, are performed. The second method applies a reciprocal transformation of the geometry. This transformation constructs a condensed elongated source surrounded by a ring detector. The reciprocal transform method proved to be an acceptable estimate of the total KERMA but its greatest advantage is that it decreases the computation time from months to hours. Therefore, the reciprocal transform method may be used to estimate the total KERMA at much greater distances than the brute force method can achieve. By a thorough study of the methodology, an improved air KERMA to activity concentration factor has been obtained for Xe-133. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Improvement of the gamma radioactivity measurements in water by the evaporation method	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Radiation Physics	SEP 17-22, 2006	Univ Coimbra, Coimbra, PORTUGAL		Univ Coimbra	environmental radioactivity; gamma radioactivity; water radioactivity; Monte Carlo method		Frequently to measure gamma radioactivity in water, the water is poured in a tray covered with a plastic film and dried in an oven. Then. the film is folded and introduced in a Petri box to be measured in a Ge(HP) detector. The present paper studies the effect, that an irregular deposition of the residue left on the plastic film when evaporating the water, introduces in the results of the measurement. The quantitative analyses of gamma radioactivity imply a previous calibration of the instrument. Calibration samples are prepared in the same way as any other, then the calibration process becomes affected by the same previously mentioned effect. The study evaluates the maximum discrepancies that can be expected from this irregular deposition of the residue. Monte Carlo program MCNP is used to simulate the experimental measurements carried out, that easily allows to study intermediate situations. Lastly. a method to avoid this type of systematic error is recommended. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

From the mass of the neutrino to the dating of wine	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Radiation Physics	SEP 17-22, 2006	Univ Coimbra, Coimbra, PORTUGAL		Univ Coimbra	double beta decay; radioactivity; wine dating		The Neutrino Ettore Majorana Observatory (NEMO) experiment, which is currently running in the Modane underground laboratory is looking for a very rare process of the natural radioactivity, called the neutrinoless double beta decay, in which a nucleus emits two electrons simultaneously. The calculated half-life being so large (similar to 10(25) years), few counts per year are expected which implies that all the background components have to be reduced by few orders of magnitude. Beside cosmic rays, external gamma-rays, neutrons and radon, the detector must be built out of materials containing no measurable radioactive isotopes such as U, Th, Ra and their progenies. Most of the natural radioactive isotopes are gamma-emitters. So, in order to be able to select and control the radiopurity of all materials, the Bordeaux group has been involved over several years in the development of low background gamma-ray spectrometers, based on the use of HPGe crystals. When applied to the radioactivity measurements of wine, the first measurements have shown that beside the well-known isotope K-40, the wine contains also weak traces Of (CS)-C-137 with an activity depending on the vintage. This technique has therefore led to the possibility to date the wine bottles having vintage between 1950 and 1980 or at least to control the year written on the label or on the cork. Furthermore, it has been shown that it is not necessary to open the bottle. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These signatures, reflecting gross gamma intensity and the Cm-242,Cm-244 content, contain information on the burn-up (BU) and cooling time (CT) of the fuel. The small size of the detectors allows close access to inside parts of the assemblies out of reach of other methods. A commercial Si diode was encapsulated in a cylindrical steel case and was used for gross gamma monitoring. CR-39 detectors were used for neutron measurements. Irradiation exposures at the NPP were implemented in the central dosimetric channel of spent fuel assemblies (SFAs) stored in borated water. Gross gamma and neutron axial profiles were taken up by scanning with the aid of a long steel guide tube, lowered down to the spent fuel pond by crane and fitted to the headpiece of the fuel assemblies. Gamma measurements were performed using a long cable introduced in this tube, with the Si diode at the end. A long steel wire was also led through the guide tube, to which a chain of 15 sample holder capsules was attached, each containing a track detector. Gamma dose rates of 0. 1-10 kGy h(-1) while neutron fluxes in a range of (0.25-26) 10(4) Cm-2 S-1 were recorded. The results are in good correlation with those of a calculation for spent fuel neutron yield. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.

The challenges associated with high burnup, high temperature and accelerated irradiation for TRISO-coated particle fuel	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st Symposium on Nuclear Fuels and Structural Materials for Next Generation Nuclear Reactors	JUN 04-08, 2006	Reno, NV	Amer Nucl Soc				Fuel service conditions proposed for the very high temperature reactor will be challenging. All major fuel-related design parameters (burnup. temperature, fast neutron fluence. power density, particle packing fraction) exceed the values that were qualified in the successful German UO2 coated particle fuel development program in the 1980s. Of particular concern are the high burnup and high temperatures expected in the very high temperature reactor. In this paper, the challenges associated with high burnup and high temperature are evaluated quantitatively by examining the performance of the fuel in terms of different known failure mechanisms. Potential design solutions to ameliorate the negative effects of high burnup and high temperature are discussed. Also of concern are the effects of accelerated irradiation on coated fuel that often occur during irradiation testing. These effects are evaluated in this paper and recommendations concerning allowable levels of accelerations are presented. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Irradiation tests of mixed-oxide fuel prepared with weapons-derived plutonium	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st Symposium on Nuclear Fuels and Structural Materials for Next Generation Nuclear Reactors	JUN 04-08, 2006	Reno, NV	Amer Nucl Soc			MOX FUEL; BEHAVIOR	Mixed-oxide test capsules prepared with weapons-derived plutonium have been irradiated to a burnup of 50 GWd/MT. The mixed-oxide fuel was fabricated at Los Alamos National Laboratory by a master-mix process and has been irradiated in the advanced test reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory. Previous withdrawals of the same fuel have occurred at 9, 21. 30. and 40 GWd/MT. Oak Ridge National Laboratory manages this test series for the Department of Energy's Fissile Materials Disposition Program. This paper describes the preparation of the mixed-oxide fuel, the equipment design. and the irradiation history of the test capsules. and discusses the significance of the more important observations of the postirradiation examinations. Code predictions (FRAPCON-3 and TRANSURANUS) are presented and compared with available post-irradiation examination data for the highest and lowest powered mixed-oxide capsules. Fuel performance has been excellent and consistent with code predictions and with existing US and European experience. Published bv Elsevier B.V.

Pile-up corrections for high-precision superallowed beta decay half-life measurements via gamma-ray photopeak counting	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						high-precision half-life measurements; gamma-ray counting; detector pulse pile-up	RADIOACTIVE BEAM; LIVES; O-14	A general technique that corrects gamma-ray gated beta decay-curve data for detector pulse pile-up is presented. The method includes corrections for non-zero time-resolution and energy-threshold effects in addition to a special treatment of saturating events due to cosmic rays. This technique is verified through a Monte Carlo simulation and experimental data using radioactive beams of Na-26 implanted at the center of the 8 pi gamma-ray spectrometer at the ISAC facility at TRIUMF in Vancouver, Canada. The P-decay half-life of Na-26 obtained from counting 1809-keV gamma-ray photopeaks emitted by the daughter Mg-26 was determined to be T-1/2 = 1.07167 +/- 0.00055 s following a 27 sigma correction for detector pulse pile-up. This result is in excellent agreement with the result of a previous measurement that employed direct beta counting and demonstrates the feasibility of high-precision beta-decay half-life measurements through the use of high-purity germanium gamma-ray detectors. The technique presented here, while motivated by superallowed-Fermi P decay studies, is general and can be used for all half-life determinations (e.g. alpha-, beta-, X-ray, fission) in which a gamma-ray photopeak is used to select the decays of a particular isotope.

Array of low-background He-3 proportional counters for the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						He-3 proportional counter; solar neutrinos; neutral current; low-radioactivity materials; neutron detection; radon-daughter mitigation; chemical-vapor deposition	ATOMS; WATER; CO	An array of Neutral-Current Detectors (NCDs) has been built in order to make a unique measurement of the total active flux of solar neutrinos in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO). Data in the third phase of the SNO experiment were collected between November 2004 and 2006, after the NCD array was added to improve the neutral-current sensitivity of the SNO detector. This array consisted of 36 strings of proportional counters filled with a mixture of He-3 and CF4 gas capable of detecting the neutrons liberated by the neutrino-deuteron neutral-current reaction in the D2O, and four strings filled with a mixture of He-4 and CF4 gas for background measurements. The proportional counter diameter is 5 cm. The total deployed array length was 398 m. The SNO NCD array is the lowest-radioactivity large array of proportional counters ever produced.

Development and operational performance of a single calibration chamber for radon detectors	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						radon chamber model; calibration protocol; leakages; active detector inter-comparison; traceability; flow-through radon source	STANDARD	This work shows the design, setup and performance of a new single radon detector calibration chamber developed at the University of Huelva (Environmental Radioactivity Group). This system is based on a certified radon source and a traceable reference radon detector, which allows radon concentrations inside the chamber radon to be obtained in steady-state conditions within a range of 400-22 000 Bq m(-3) with associated uncertainties in the range of 4%. In addition, the development of a new ad hoe calibration protocol (UHU-RC/01/06 "Rachel"), which is based on the modelling of radon concentration within the chamber, allows it to be used without the reference detector. To do that, a complete characterization and calibration of the different leakage constants and the flow meter reading have been performed. The accuracy and general performance of both working methods for the same chamber (i.e., with and without the reference detector) have been tested by means of their participation in an intercomparison exercise involving five active radon monitors.

Neutronics, activation and waste management of the Candor experiment	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							IGNITER EXPERIMENT; D-HE-3	The paper examines the neutronics and activation of Candor, a proposed design evolution of Ignitor in the direction of a device using a DHe fuel cycle. The main characteristics of the Candor machine are described. Activation calculations were done with two codes: ANITA and FISPACT. A comparison of the results for the two codes is carried out. Finally, the paper draws some conclusion on the radioactive waste management options for Candor. No Candor spent material will need to be disposed of as permanent waste in underground repositories. All materials may be recycled, if convenient, after a short interim decay. Concerning clearance, the structure may be declassified after less than 50 years of decay. For magnets, about 100 years of interim decay are necessary. Candor does reach the zero-waste option, without the need of any materials selection, low-activation materials, or further shielding. The final design of a fusion power plant with DHe3 plasmas has yet to be conceived. However, the zero-waste option is a reachable goal for such reactors, as the results for Candor have indicated.

One of them, which is the GFR reference design, is a ceramic plate matrix with a honeycomb inner structure containing small fuel cylinders. The fuel is mixed plutonium-uranium carbide, while the matrix material is silicon carbide. A two-dimensional approach to simulation of the thermal behaviour (for both steady-state and transient analysis) of such fuel, taking into account the inner heterogeneity, has been developed and benchmarked against detailed finite-element calculations. The resultant model can provide reliable fuel and matrix temperatures to determine neutronic feedbacks, as also to evaluate fuel integrity. As such, it has been integrated into PSI's coupled code system "FAST", which aims at the comprehensive safety analysis of advanced fast reactor systems. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Investigating the distribution characteristics of boiling flow and released nuclide in the steam generator secondary side using CFI methodology	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							PHASE-CHANGE PROBLEMS; BULK EVAPORATION; SIMULATION; CONDENSATION; HEAT	The steam generator (SG) plays an important role for the pressurized water reactor (PWR) not only in the primary-to-secondary heat transfer but also in the pressure boundary as the fission product barrier. Therefore, the leak or rupture of SG tubes results in the decrease of heat exchange capability as well as the release of radioactive nuclide to the environment. Therefore, a multi-dimensional flow boiling model is proposed in this paper to simulate the thermal-hydraulic characteristics and released nuclide distribution in the SG secondary side. This model can provide the local velocity, temperature, enthalpy, void fraction and released nuclide distributions, etc. The three-dimensional distribution characteristics of released nuclide can be reasonably captured, which includes dilution, dispersion and swirling phenomena, etc. The simulation results can provide the operator the distribution characteristics of two-phase field and released nuclide. They can also help the operator confirm the assumption for the homogeneity of released nuclide concentration for chemical sampling in the blowdown system, judge the possible leak location, and carry out the diagnostic and appropriate actions.

The model is formulated for coupling reactor kinetics with feedback reactivity and the reactor core thermal-hydraulics. Two channels are considered: the average and the hot channels to represent the reactor core. The developed computer program is compiled and executed on a personal computer using the FORTRAN language. The model is validated by safety-related benchmark calculation for MTR-Type reactors of IAEA 10 MW generic reactor for both slow and fast reactivity insertion transients [IAEA-TECDOC, 1980. Research Reactor Core Conversion from the use of Highly Enriched Uranium to the use of Low Enriched Uranium Fuels, Guidebook. Tecdoc, 233, Tecdoc, 643]. A good agreement is shown between the present model and the benchmark calculations. Then, the model is used for simulating uncontrolled withdrawal of a control plate: of ETRR-2 for both transients: transient with over power scram trip and self-limited transient. The model results for ETRR-2 were analyzed and discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The S-32(alpha,pn)(34m) Cl reaction on elemental sulfur of natural isotopic composition was adopted for the production method. The target sulfur was melted by heating in the target chamber and then irradiated with 65 MeV alpha particles (58.2 MeV on target) at 3 mu A for 30 min. Generated Cl-34m was extracted remotely with hot water from the molten sulfur in the target chamber. Within 20 min, [Cl-34m]chloride was obtained as a 10 +/- 3 mL aqueous solution at a yield of 450 +/- 90 MBq, which corresponds to a recovery efficiency of 79+/-17% (n = 5).

Tritium activity levels in environmental water samples from different origins	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						tritium; liquid scintillation counting; surface water; mineral bottled water	SPAIN	Tritium activity was determined in environmental waters from different areas of Catalonia, using a distillation procedure before liquid scintillation counting. The developed method was validated by analysing two samples from proficiency tests. In most of water samples (from rivers, rain, mineral bottled waters and tap waters) analysed, the activity values were lower or close to the minimum detectable activity (MDA) for our method which has a value of 0.6 Bq/l. However, the Ebro river samples had a mean activity around 3.6 +/- 0.6 Bq/l. The nuclear power station of Asco, which is located on the banks of this river, can be a source of tritium production and introduction into the environment, so a more exhaustive study of these waters was carried out. Tritium activities in this river were a long way above the normative limit in Spain for waters intended for human consumption, which is 100 Bq/l. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Excitation functions of Ge-nat(p,xn)(71,72,73,74) As reactions up to 100 MeV with a focus on the production of As-72 for medical and As-73 for environmental studies	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						As-71; (72)AS; (73)AS; As-74; excitation function; integral yield; model calculation		Excitation functions for the formation of the arsenic radionuclides 71As, As-72, As-73 and As-74 in the interaction of protons with Ge-nat were measured from the respective threshold energy up to 100 MeV. The conventional stacked-foil technique was used and the needed thin samples were prepared by sedimentation. Irradiations were done at three cyclotrons: CV 28 and injector of COSY at Forschungszentrum Julich, and Separate Sector Cyclotron at iThemba LABS, Somerset West. The radioactivity was measured via high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometry. The measured cross section data were compared with the literature data as well as with the nuclear model calculations. In both cases, the results generally agree but there are discrepancies in some areas, the results of nuclear model calculation and some of the literature data being somewhat higher than our data. The integral yields of the four radionuclides were calculated from the measured excitation functions. The beta(+) emitting nuclide As-72 (T-1/2 = 26.01 h) can be produced with reasonable radionuclidic purity (As-71 impurity: < 10%) over the energy range E-p = 18 -> 8 MeV; the yield of 93 MBq/mu A h is, however, low. The radionuclide As-73 (T-1/2 = 80.30 d), a potentially useful indicator in environmental studies, could be produced with good radionuclidic purity (As-74 impurity: < 11%) over the energy range E-p = 30 -> 18 MeV, provided, a decay time of about 60 days is allowed. Its yield would then correspond to 2.4 MBq/mu A h, and GBq amounts could be produced when using a high current target. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Uranium migration in a sedimentological phosphatic environment in Northern Palmyrides, Al-Awabed area, Syria	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						phosphate and uranium prospecting; uranium migration; aerial spectrometry survey; Al-awabed region; Syria	STATISTICAL FACTOR-ANALYSIS; SPECTROMETRIC SIGNATURES; DEPOSITS	In previously published research, a factor analysis approach has been applied to airborne spectrometric data of the Al-Awabed area, Northern Palmyrides, Syria. A model of four factors (F1-F4) has proven to be sufficient to represent the acquired data, where 94% of the total data variance is explained. A scored lithological map including 11 radiometric units is established. Uranium migration trends have been determined for the first time through airborne spectrometric data of the study region, where different regional maps explaining the migration behavior have been established. A radioactive-geological model of such a migration is established and clearly shows that directions of uranium migration are strongly influenced by network drainage, topography, and fracturing systems in the region. Lithology of the 11 studied units also plays a dominant role in the rate of uranium migration. It was found that the four lithological phosphatic units P1-P4 are the main uranium sources in the study region, where the uranium migration is outward from these regions. The other seven lithological units C1-C3, M1-M4 are successively enriched by uranium during the geological evolution of the crust, where uranium migration is in an inward direction. It was also shown that uranium migration has occurred from its source for a short distance, limited by the boundaries of the lithological units which surround the phosphatic units. This finding is important from a prospecting and exploration point of view, and suggests that future uranium investigation activities are close to the phosphatic sources, if this process is creating the uranium distribution.

Innovative development of nuclear power in Russia	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The basic principles for performing analysis and the systems requirements for large-scale nuclear power in our country are formulated. The problems of modern nuclear power are examined and ways for modern nuclear power to transition to innovative development while satisfying these systems requirements for fuel use, handling spent fuel and wastes, and nonproliferation are indicated. The basic scenario of innovative development in the near term (up to 2030) is based on using predominantly U-238 as fuel and water-moderated water-cooled reactors, which have been well mastered, for increasing nuclear capacities with limited introduction of fast reactors for solving the problem of spent fuel from thermal reactors. In the long term (2030-2050), a transition to U-238 as the primary raw material with fast reactors predominating and complete closure of the nuclear power fuel cycle will be made.

Simulation of high-temperature swelling of uranium dioxide and deformation behavior of a fuel element	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								Models and computer codes, developed based on them, for simulating the swelling of uranium dioxide (BARS) and the stress-deformation state of a fuel element (SDS) under high-temperature irradiation are presented. It is shown that when developing a design for high-temperature fuel elements and validating their serviceability the quantitative indicator required for the swelling of uranium dioxide in the range >= 1400 degrees C is the change in the external dimensions of the fuel caused by constant formation and growth of bubbles containing gaseous fission products during irradiation. The results of computational investigations using the models indicated are examined. These results eliminate the inconsistency of the data on the effect of the main operating parameters - the temperature and burnup - on the radiation characteristics and service life behavior of a fuel element. It is shown that the central channel in the fuel kernel and strengthening of the cladding improve the dimensional stability fuel elements.								CHUBB W, 1976, AT TEKH RUBEZH, P10; Degal'tsev Yu.
