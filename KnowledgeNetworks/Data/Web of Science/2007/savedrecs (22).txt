Oxidation of pyrite by oxygen and concurrent leaching of uranium from ore under the conditions of an autogenous autoclave process	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The technology of autogenous autoclave leaching of uranium from refractory titanate ores (brannerites) which is under development at the All-Russia Research Institute of Chemical Technology is based on the use of low-grade pyrites as the raw material, having no commercial value, to obtain sulfuric acid (dissolving agent) and trivalent-iron sulfate (oxidizer) by using the oxygen in air to oxidize the pyrite present in the ores directly in the process of autoclave leaching of the ore. Studies of the effect of the sulfuric acid concentration and consumption of the pyrite concentrate on the degree of uranium extraction from refractory titanate (brannerite) aluminosilicate ores in the process of autogenous autoclave leaching of uranium have confirmed that low-grade pyrite (pyrite concentrate) oxidized in an autoclave at 160 degrees C can completely replace sulfuric acid and pyrolusite. They have also confirmed a high degree of uranium extraction from the ore into solution (> 90%) to residual content in leach cakes at the level 0.005-0.007% with 20-30% consumption of the pyrite concentrate (similar to 51% pyrite). Ways to decrease the pyrite consumption are indicated.								Dutrizac J.

J	Williams, T; Klaiber, G				Williams, T.; Klaiber, G.			Nuclear fuel: Sustainable source of energy or burden on society?	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								In the past, the question concerning the sustainability of a resource primarily addressed its finite nature. Accordingly, electricity production using renewable energies was clearly sustainable. Contrasting this are systems based on oil, gas, coal or uranium. However, from the perspective of "neosustainability" being analyzed today, this assessment appears less clear-cut, especially in light of the definition of sustainability as provided by the Brundtland report. Nowadays, the depletion time of fuel resources is thus not the only significant aspect, but factors such as efficiency, ecofriendliness and social responsibility also figure in. The nuclear fuel supply is analyzed from a sustainability perspective. After a short description of the supply chain, each of the most important aspects of sustainability are related to the individual stages of the supply chain and evaluated. This method aims at answering the question concerning to what extent nuclear fuel is a sustainable Source of energy. Although the recycling of fissile materials from reprocessing and the deployment of advanced reactors are key factors as regards the issue of sustainability, these topics are deliberately only touched on. The main focus lies on the sustainability of the nuclear fuel cycle as it is currently utilized in light water reactors, without discussing the subject of reprocessing.

UO(2) fuel behaviour at rod burn-ups up to 105 MWd/kgHM - A review of 10 years of high burn-up examinations commissioned by AREVA NP	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article							MATRIX SWELLING RATE; THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; NUCLEAR-FUEL	Irradiation experience gained on fuel rods with burn-ups greater than 60 MWd/kgHM irradiated in the Nuclear Power Plant Gosgen, Switzerland, is described. Emphasis is placed on the fuel behaviour, which has been analysed by hot cell examinations at the Institute for Transuranium Elements and the Paul-Scherrer Institute. Above 60 MWd/kgHM, the so-called high burn-up structure (HBS) forms and the fission gas release increases with burn-up and rod power. Examinations performed in the outer region of the fuel revealed that most if not all of the fission gas created was retained in the FIBS, even at 25% porosity. Furthermore, the FIBS has a relatively low swelling rate, greatly increased plasticity, and its thermal conductivity is higher than expected from the porosity. The post-irradiation examinations showed that the HBS has no detrimental effects on the performance of stationary irradiated PWR fuel irradiated to the high burn-ups that can be achieved with 5 wt% U-235 enrichment. On the contrary, the HBS results in fuel performance that is generally better than it would have been if the HBS had not formed.

Requirements for a long-term safety certification for chemotoxic substances stored in a final storage facility for high radioactive and heat-generating radioactive waste in rock salt formations	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								Within the scope of a project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (Bundesministerium fur Wirtschaft und Technologie, BMWi), a safety certification concept for a future permanent final storage for high radioactive and heat-generating radioactive waste (HAW disposal facility) in rock salt formations is being prepared. For a reference concept, compliance with safety requirements in regard to operational safety as well as radiological and non-radiological protection objectives related to long-term safety, including ground water protection, will be evaluated. This paper deals with the requirements for a long-term safety certification for the purpose of protecting ground water from chemotoxic substances. In particular, long-term safety certifications for the permanent disposal of radioactive waste in a HAW disposal facility in rock salt formations and for the dumping of hazardous waste in underground storage facilities in rock salt formations are first discussed, followed by an evaluation as to whether these methods can be applied to the long-term safety certification for chemotoxic substances. The authors find it advisable to apply the long-term safety certification for underground storage facilities to the long-term safety certification for chemotoxic substances stored in a HAW disposal facility in rock salt formations. In conclusion, a corresponding certification concept is introduced.

J	Das, S; Biswas, BB				Das, S.; Biswas, B. B.			Controlling nuclear plants with fuel efficiency	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article								The concept of expending minimum control energy while stabilizing or maneuvering reactor power for a nuclear reactor is the key for a fuel efficient reactor control. This concept is got by treating the reactor close to its natural characteristics by a new Power & Period (P&P) control scheme, instead treating the reactor control as conventional PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) block.. This is proven by spending only the required rate of reactivity and not more to govern the power by setting together a power error and period error. Thereby through the characteristic reactor equation (inverse-hour rule),defining the absolute step reactivity required at each power points. However the use of logarithmic logics in the new P&P method does add another concept of ratio control, where the effective power error is generated by ratio of demanded power exponential to the observed power exponential curves. This method indeed thus compares the shape (or the form factor) of the exponential curve demanded with the observed (jittered) trajectory, thereafter linearizing the same by taking logarithm of the ratio to give error function to actuate the final control element. Obviously the shape control of the natural neutronics at every power point does give a true fuel efficient reactor concept. The mechanism of P&P control is elaborated and it is shown that how the error rate is modulated at each power point, thereby asking lesser reactivity rate to do the governing as compared to classical PID method. The concepts described herein is general and is applicable for any type of nuclear reactor.

EU Commission energy package - the role of nuclear energy	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								Under the title "An Energy Policy for Europe", on January 10, 2007, the European Commission presented its plans for an energy policy concept for the coming years, with the intention of advancing the European energy policy. The Commission promotes a structural change in favor of a low-CO2 energy supply. Moreover, in addition to combating the climate change, the measures are intended to aid in reducing the European Union's dependency on importing fossil fuels, particularly oil and gas. The published Nuclear Illustrative Programme (PINC) is also a part of the energy package, which comprises a large number of documents related to individual subject areas. According to the EURATOM treaty, the EU Commission is required to publish a Nuclear Illustrative Programme at regular intervals. Based on valid arguments, the report elaborates on the fact that utilization of nuclear energy plays an important role on a global scale and for the European energy policy. PINC emphasizes the efficiency of nuclear energy for generating electricity, its contribution to climate protection and the robustness of the uranium supply against increasing prices.									0	0	0	0	1	VERLAGSGRP HANDELSBLATT GMBH	DUSSELDORF	POSTFACH 10 11 02, D-40002 DUSSELDORF, GERMANY	1431-5254			ATW-INT J NUCL POWER	ATW-Int.

The feature of the electrochemical hydrogen pump is that the driving force of hydrogen transportation is a potential difference. Therefore, it might be effective to apply the hydrogen pump to the blanket sweep gas (the low hydrogen and water vapor pressure). Perovskite-type ceramic such as SrCe0.95Yb0.05O3-alpha is one of the candidate proton conductor for hydrogen pump and its ionic hydrogen transportation properties have been investigated. In this work, the basic mass transfer equation for hydrogen, in which the apparent proton conductivity is used as the over-all mass transfer coefficient, is proposed. And then, the apparent proton conductivities were estimated from experimental data using these equations, and mass transfer of hydrogen via proton conductor membrane was discussed by using the apparent conductivity.

An appropriate mechanical design of the membrane module has been developed in order to avoid any significant compressive and bending stresses on the very long and thin wall permeator tube: two expanded bellows have been applied to the Pd-Ag tube, so that it has been pre-tensioned before operating. The elongation of the metal permeator under hydrogenation has been theoretically estimated and experimentally verified for properly designing the membrane reactor. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

GAMMA 10 Grp	Overview of recent progress in the gamma 10 tandem mirror	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Open Magnetic Systems for Plasma Confinement	JUL 17-21, 2006	Tsukuba, JAPAN				X-RAY-DETECTORS; SEMICONDUCTOR-DETECTOR; POTENTIAL FORMATION; SCALING LAWS; ELECTRON TEMPERATURES; PLASMA ION; CONFINING POTENTIALS; THERMAL BARRIERS; CENTRAL-CELL; CONFINEMENT	(1) Four-time progress in ion-confining potentials phi(c) to 3.0 kV in comparison to phi(c) attained 1992-2002 is achieved in the hot-ion mode (T-i=several keV). A scaling of phi(c), which favorably increases with plug electron-cyclotron heating (ECH) powers (P-PECH), is obtained. (2) The advance in phi(c) leads to a finding of remarkable effects of radially sheared electric fields (dE(r)/dr) on turbulence suppression and transverse-loss reduction. (3) A weak decrease in phi(c) with increasing n(c) to similar to 10(19) m(-3) with the recovery of phi(c) with increasing P-PECH is obtained. (4) The first achievement of active control and formation of an internal transport barrier (ITB) has been carried out with the improvement of transverse energy confinement. Off-axis ECH in an axisymmetric barrier mirror produces a cylindrical layer with energetic electrons, which flow through the central cell and into the end region. The layer, which produces a localized bumped ambipolar potential Phi(c), generates a strong E-r shear and peaked vorticity with the direction reversal of E(r)xB sheared flow near the Phi(c) peak. Intermittent vortex-like turbulent structures near the layer are suppressed in the central cell. This results in T-e and T-i rises surrounded by the layer. The phenomena are analogous to those in tokamaks with ITB. (5) Preliminary central ECH (170 kW 20 ms) in a standard tandem-mirror operation raises T-e0 from 70 to 300 eV together with T-i perpendicular to 0 from 4.5 to 6.1 keV, and T-i//0 from 0.5 to 1.2 keV with tau(p0)=95 ms for phi(c) (=1.4 kV) trapped ions. The on-axis particle to energy confining ratio of tau(p0)/tau(E0) is observed to be 1.7 for phi(c) trapped ions (consistent with Pastukhov's theory) and 2.4 for central mirror-trapped ions with 240-kW plug ECH and 90-kW ICH (eta(ICH)similar to 0.3; nl(c)=4.5X10(17)m(-2)). (6) Recently, a 200 kW central ECH with 430 kW plug ECH produces stable central-cell plasmas (T-e=600 eV and T-i=6.6 keV) with azimuthal E(r)xB sheared flow. However, in the absence of the shear flow, hot plasmas migrate unstably towards vacuum wall with plasma degradation.

Wave excitation in magnetically confined plasmas with an anisotropic velocity distribution	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Open Magnetic Systems for Plasma Confinement	JUL 17-21, 2006	Tsukuba, JAPAN				ION-CYCLOTRON EMISSION; TANDEM MIRROR; INSTABILITY; JT-60U; JET	In magnetically confined plasmas, fluctuations in the ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) will be driven by the presence of non-thermal ion energy distributions. In a typical discharge in the GAMAM 10 tandem mirror, Alfven-ion-cyclotron (AIC) modes are spontaneously excited due to strong temperature anisotropy. On the other hand, in fusion-oriented devices with a toroidal configuration, neutral beam (NB) injection is commonly used to create high performance plasmas. The resultant high-energy ions are trapped in local mirrors and will form velocity distributions with strong anisotropy. Especially in burning plasma experiments on JET and TFTR, fusion-product (FP) ions form non-thermal ion energy distributions in the bulk plasma and ion cyclotron emission (ICE) has been observed The main purpose of this work is to study the relation between AIC-modes and ICEs in magnetically confined plasmas with non-thermal energy distributions. Recently, fluctuation measurements made by using ICRF antennas as pickup loops on JT-60U have been started. When the deuterium-NBs are injected into deuterium bulk plasma, magnetic fluctuations due to injected beams and FP ions are detected Wave excitation near the ion cyclotron frequency and its higher harmonics is studied experimentally in plasmas with non-thermal ion energy distributions.

It is shown that the flow of hot plasma through cold cells of a multiple-mirror trap can lead to excitation of oscillations in these cells with omega similar to nu(Ti)/l. The frequency range and the parallel polarization of the oscillations ensure that they scatter most passing ions in parallel velocity, thus providing a self-sustaining mechanism of improvement of parallel confinement.

J	Agren, O; Moiseenko, VE				Agren, O.; Moiseenko, V. E.			On MHD stability, ellipticity, omnigenuity, constants of motions and a modified thermal barrier of a straight field line mirror	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Open Magnetic Systems for Plasma Confinement	JUL 17-21, 2006	Tsukuba, JAPAN					The straight field line mirror field(1) is the unique field which gives the lowest ellipticity of the flux tube of an MHD stable minimum B mirror field. In this particular vacuum field, each gyro center bounces back and forth on a single magnetic field line, and a pair of two new constants of motion is associated with this property(2). Using these invariants in the Vlasov equation, it can be shown that the radial gyro center magnetic drift is absent to first order in the plasma beta, and the equilibrium is omnigenous. The neoclassical increase of the radial transport may thus be avoided without an axisymmetrization of this single cell mirror. A scheme to improve end confinement of ions, and simultaneously create an electric potential barrier for the electrons and a sloshing ion component, has been proposed. The end plugging transforms ions under way to escape into the loss cone into sloshing ions by ion cyclotron resonance heating. Numerical studies on sloshing ion production by RF heating(4) demonstrate strong absorption of the RF field near the fundamental gyro frequency resonance of the minority deuterium ions as well as near the tritium second harmonic gyro frequency resonance.

Two-dimensional spectroscopic measurement of hydrogen emission in JT-60U divertor plasmas	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Open Magnetic Systems for Plasma Confinement	JUL 17-21, 2006	Tsukuba, JAPAN					In JT-60U divertor plasmas, deuterium Balmer-series line emission has been measured with a wide spectral-band spectrometer, which has 92 viewing chords with a similar to 1 cm spatial resolution. Two-dimensional spatial distribution of the Balmer line intensities has been reconstructed using a computer tomography technique (maximum entropy method). In an inner-detached and outer-attached divertor plasma, the intensity of D,6 and D, lines were stronger above the strike point in the inner divertor and near the strike point in the outer divertor. The ratio of the D-gamma line intensity to the D-beta line intensity was 0.3-0.5 above the strike point in the inner divertor and 0-0.2 near the strike point in the outer divertor. It suggested that the line emission were attributed to the plasma recombination above the strike point in the inner divertor and the plasma ionization near the strike point in the outer divertor.

Effects of plasma confining potentials and the associated radially sheared electric fields on the plasma energy confinement	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Open Magnetic Systems for Plasma Confinement	JUL 17-21, 2006	Tsukuba, JAPAN				SEMICONDUCTOR DETECTOR ARRAY; X-RAY; TEMPERATURES; GAMMA-10; ION; DIAGNOSTICS; PARTICLES	The effects of the plasma-confining potentials and the associated radially sheared electric fields on the central-cell electron energy confinement are theoretically and experimentally investigated in the GAMMA 10 tandem mirror. In particular, the scaling of the central-cell electron temperatures with electron-confining potentials is studied on the basis of the local energy-balance equation. The obtained theoretical scaling of electron temperatures with electron-confining potentials is then compared with the experimentally observed relation between these two parameters. Recently, by the use of new 0.5-M'W level gyrotrons in the plug region, four-time progress in the formation of the ion-confining potential phi(c) including a new record of 3 W has been achieved in a hot-ion mode having bulk-ion temperature T-i = several keV In the hot-ion mode, intermittent vortex-like turbulent structures are observed in the case without the gyrotron injections; in this case, radially produced weak shear of electric fields dE(r)/dr and appreciable transverse losses are observed. However, during the application of electron-cyclotron heatings, the associated potential rise produces a stronger shear in the central cell (dE(r)/dr = several 10 kV/m2) resulting in the disappearance of such intermittent turbulent vortices with plasma confinement improvement. In order to investigate the effect of the radially sheared electric fields on the electron energy confinement, the radial profiles of the thermal diffusivity are derived from the local power-balance analysis by the use of the data from the following various diagnostics in the above-described hot-ion mode. The obtained radial profiles of radial electric field and thermal diffusivity imply that the reduction of the thermal diffusivity is associated with the radially produced strong shear of electric fields.

Extremity dosimetry for radiation workers handling unsealed radionuclides in nuclear medicine departments in India	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						dosimetry; personnel; exposure; occupational; nuclear medicine; radioisotope	EXPOSURE; PERSONNEL; RADIOPHARMACY; SYNOVECTOMY; STAFF	In India, for the past five decades, whole body radiation dose of radiation workers has been monitored by means of film and thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) badges worn on the body. However, there are no provision/regulatory requirements to monitor doses received at the extremities, i.e., to fingers. Finger dose monitoring is essential for controlling the extremity dose limits for occupational personnel handling unsealed radioactive sources. In order to estimate the doses received in various types of procedures using unsealed sources, finger dose monitoring was carried out in 54 major institutions in the country using a specially designed plastic ringer ring embedded with a TLD. The maximum finger dose of occupational workers involved in handling Tc-99m in such activities as extraction and radiopharmacy work is 0.35 mSv GBq(-1) during injection of radiopharmaceuticals and scintigraphy, the doses were observed to be 1 and 0.95 mSv GBq(-1), respectively. Similarly, while handling F-18-FDG, the maximum doses received during dispensing, injection, and scintigraphy were 0.098,0.324, and 0.56 mSv GBq(-1), respectively. The maximum radiation dose received during Re-188/Re-186 balloon angioplasty and while handling Sm-153 was 3.92 and 6.5 mSv GBq(-1), respectively. All the doses recorded were well within the prescribed limit. However, monitoring of these doses periodically would help in compiling the feedback regarding the work practices followed in institutions handling radioisotopes in the country and would also help in maintaining a record of safe work procedures while handling radioisotopes.

The concentration of both radioelements in digested ashed bone samples was determined using sector-field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The geometric means for uranium level in bones showed a significant statistical difference between the two locations studied. Similarly for thorium, a statistical difference was observed, although this difference was considered marginal. The thorium concentration differed only marginally with respect to age group, indicating that its behavior in the body could be age-independent. Conversely, the uranium level in bones was found to change for the age groups tested, an indication of age-specific deposition. The age profile for uranium was comparable to the calcium turn-over rate, indicating that uranium deposition is probably, in part, dictated by this metabolic process, showing the role of present uptake into the uranium concentration in bones	Hlth Canada, Radiat Protect Bur, Ottawa, ON K1A 1C1, Canada; Hlth Canada, Environm Hlth Sci Bur, Ctr Environm Hlth, Ottawa, ON K1A 0K9, Canada	Lariviere, D (reprint author), Hlth Canada, Radiat Protect Bur, 775 Brookfield Rd,Address Locator 6302D1, Ottawa, ON K1A 1C1, Canada.	dominic_lariviere@hc-sc.gc.ca	Packer, Ana Paula/E-1819-2012; Packer, Ana Paula/D-8851-2015				Al-Jundi J, 2004, J ENVIRON RADIOACTIV, V71, P61, DOI 10.1016/S0265-931X(03)00141-3; Becker JS, 2005, INT J MASS SPECTROM, V242, P183, DOI 10.1016/j.ijms.2004.11.009; BROADWAY JA, 1983, HEALTH PHYS, V45, P765; FISENNE IM, 1984, HEALTH PHYS, V46, P438; FISENNE IM, 1988, RADIAT PROT DOSIM, V24, P127; FISENNE IM, 1986, HEALTH PHYS, V50, P739, DOI 10.1097/00004032-198606000-00004; FISENNE IM, 1987, HEALTH PHYS, V53, P357, DOI 10.1097/00004032-198710000-00002; GOANS RE, 1995, BONE, V16, P33, DOI 10.1016/8756-3282(95)80008-E; HAMILTON EI, 1972, HEALTH PHYS, V22, P149, DOI 10.1097/00004032-197202000-00004; HARLEY NH, 1990, HEALTH PHYS, V58, P515; IBRAHIM SA, 1983, HEALTH PHYS, V44, P213, DOI 10.1097/00004032-198306001-00018; International Commision on Radiological Protection, 1995, ICRP PUBL 3, V25; JAISWAL DD, 1994, J RADIOAN NUCL CH AR, V182, P97, DOI 10.1007/BF02047971; LEGGETT RW, 1994, HEALTH PHYS, V67, P589, DOI 10.1097/00004032-199412000-00002; LEGGETT RW, 1982, HEALTH PHYS, V43, P307, DOI 10.1097/00004032-198209000-00001; LIANQING L, 1990, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V90, P267, DOI 10.1016/0048-9697(90)90198-4; LINSALATA P, 1994, J ENVIRON QUAL, V23, P633; LUCAS HF, 1970, HEALTH PHYS, V19, P739, DOI 10.1097/00004032-197012000-00003; Ottawa: Federal - Provincial - Territorial Committee on Drinking Water, 2001, GUID CAN DRINK WAT Q; Pietrzak-Flis Z, 2001, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V273, P163, DOI 10.1016/S0048-9697(00)00849-4; Priest N.

Factors affecting dose estimates for long-term performance assessments: Case study - Armagosa Valley	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						dose assessment; groundwater; dose; population; radioactivity; environmental	C-14	The purpose of this study was to review and evaluate some of the factors that influence the dose estimates to members of the public due to chronic, long-term releases of radioactive materials into the environment. Although the examples discussed are based on data from the Amargosa Valley located near the proposed Yucca Mountain high-level radioactive waste repository, the factors evaluated are common to any such assessment. While it is recognized that such factors include those related to both the environmental transport of radionuclides from the point of release through the environmental media to the receptor, and the influence of his/her location and living habits, the assessments that follow are primarily limited to the latter. The specific goal in all cases was to illustrate how the assumptions and input values relative to certain factors influence the dose estimates and to quantify, to the extent possible, their relative significance. At the same time, it must be recognized that the assessments presented here were limited to doses due to the ingestion of food and water; those due to the inhalation of airborne radionuclides and external exposures were not considered. The factor that proved most important from the standpoint of the overestimation of doses (i.e., conservatism) was the implementation of the regulatory requirements pertaining to the withdrawal of groundwater from the local aquifer. Another significant source of conservatism was the dose estimates provided by the U.S. Department of Energy, assuming that the Reasonably Maximally Exposed Individual (RMEI) resided at the U.S. EPA designated site, 18 km from the repository, vs. the Amargosa Valley, about 35 km away. Also important, for selected radionuclides, was the impact of their effective half-lives on the committed doses, as estimated, in comparison to those that would actually be received. Having lesser impacts were the status of a local aquaculture farm on the intake of C-14, and the intake of stable iodine on dose estimates for I-129. On the basis of these evaluations, one can reasonably conclude that the overall conservatism in the dose assessments, based on these sources that were identified, approaches an order of magnitude. The sole factor that led to an underestimation of the doses (i.e., non-conservatism) was the regulatory requirement that the concept of the RMEI, as defined by U.S. EPA, in contrast to that of the Critical Group (CG), as recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection, be applied in estimating the doses to potentially affected population groups. Rather than dwell on the differences in the impacts of the application of each of these two concepts, the next step should be to subject each concept to a systematic and rigorous analysis, the goal being to gain an understanding of the range of dose estimates that would be yielded, the underlying reasons for the differences that are observed, and the lessons to be learned in terms of improving the methodologies for estimating doses due to environmental radionuclide releases.

The dose estimates are based on numerous environmental measurements supplemented by further human whole body measurements and studies on occupational and dietary habits of Slavic and Turkish ethnic groups. Estimated doses arise mainly from use of the contaminated floodplains alongside the Techa River. The current average annual effective dose attributable to Cs-137 and Sr-90 in the environment, under conditions where restrictions on some river-related activities are in place, may exceed the Russian national action level of 1 mSv only in the hypothetical critical group of herdsmen in Muslumovo. The dose to this critical group in Brodokalmak is assessed to be 3 times less than that in Muslumovo and 2 fold below the action level. The external and internal exposures give comparable contributions to the total dose in both settlements and population groups: 47% and 53% in Muslumovo and 40% and 60% in Brodokalmak, respectively. About one quarter to one half of the internal dose in adults arises from the intake of Sr-90. In order to avoid substantial increases in the dose received by Muslumovo residents, it is expedient to prolong the current policy of restriction of some river-related population activities in this village.

An experimental analysis of some of the factors affecting gross alpha-particle activity with an emphasis on Ra-226 and its progeny	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						alpha particles; radioactivity; environmental; radium; water	RADIOCHEMICAL DETERMINATION; URANIUM	This work presents an experimental investigation of the measurement of the gross alpha-particle activity of water samples by EPA Method 900.0. The residue produced in Method 900.0 is modeled by a BaSO4 precipitate distributed over a planchet. The dependence of the gross alpha-particle activity on the activity of Ra-226 and its progeny, on the residue mass and geometry, and on the time between sample preparation and analysis is studied. It is shown that these factors can cause the gross alpha-particle activity of a sample to vary by more than a factor of three for replicate samples and to significantly overestimate the alpha activity of the residue. For a given sample geometry, the gross-alpha particle activity generally increases as the residue mass increases owing to the presence of the radium progeny.

J	Villeneuve, PJ; Morrison, HI; Lane, R				Villeneuve, Paul J.; Morrison, Howard I.; Lane, Rachel			Radon and lung cancer risk: An extension of the mortality follow-up of the Newfoundland fluorspar cohort	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						radon; lungs; human; cancer; epidemiology	RESIDENTIAL RADON; URANIUM MINERS; RECORD LINKAGE; DATA-BASE; EXPOSURE; WORKERS; SYSTEM; CANADA; CARCINOMA; SILICOSIS	Radon is a well-recognized cause of lung cancer, and studies of underground miners have provided invaluable insights on the mechanisms of radon carcinogenesis. Given the dramatic decreases in occupational exposures and the latent interval between the time of exposure and the development of lung cancer, continued follow-up of these cohorts is needed to address uncertainties in risk estimates. Here, we report on the relationship between radon and lung cancer mortality in a cohort of 1,742 Newfoundland fluorspar miners between 1950 and 2001; follow-up has been extended 11 y from previous analyses. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was used to compare the mortality experience of the cohort to similarly aged Newfoundland males. Poisson regression methods were used to characterize the radon-lung cancer relationship with respect to: age at first exposure, attained age, time since last exposure, interactions with cigarette smoking, and exposure rate. In total, 191 lung cancers were observed among underground miners (SMR = 3.09; 95% CI = 2.66, 3.56). ERR/ WLMs decreased with attained age and time since last exposure. An inverse dose-rate effect was observed, while age at first exposure was not associated with lung cancer risk. An important strength of this study is that the effects of gamma radiation, thoron, and radioactive dust, common exposures in other miner studies, can be ruled out because the source of radon was from water running through the mine. However, the results should be interpreted cautiously due to uncertainties associated with the estimation of radon exposure levels before ventilation was introduced into the mine, and the relatively small number of lung cancer deaths that precluded joint modeling of multiple risk factors.

Evaluation of two commercially available portal monitors for emergency response	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topic; emergency planning; contamination; monitors, radiation		The Human Monitoring Laboratory has compared two types (the P3 and the MiniSentry) of portal monitors that can be field deployed in response to an emergency. They can be used to screen persons for internal or external radioactive contamination by fission activation products (neither unit is capable of detecting alpha or beta radiation, and the amount of material required to alarm the monitors is unacceptably high for low energy x rays or gamma rays) following an incident involving the release or radioactive material (accidental or intentional). It was found that the P3 benefits from simplicity but requires slightly more activity to alarm than the MiniSentry although for emergency response, the amount of activity that can be detected is far below a level where significant health effects will occur. The MiniSentry was found to have more capability than the P3, but these benefits also bring their own disadvantages. It was also found that the MiniSentry would be difficult to deploy in an outdoor setting whereas the P3 is well designed for a field setting. Despite the differences found, the HML has concluded that both have a distinct place in emergency monitoring. In the future, the HML plans to have both instruments ready for field deployment.

While only a limited number of views on one side of the breast can be acquired due to mechanical and time constraints, we developed a technique to compensate for the limited angle artifact in reconstruction images and accurately estimate both the lesion size and radioactivity concentration. Various angular sampling strategies were evaluated using both simulated and experimental data. It was demonstrated that quantification of lesion size to an accuracy of 10% and quantification of radioactivity to an accuracy of 20% are feasible from limited-angle data acquired with clinically practical dosage and acquisition time.

A microvolumetric beta blood counter for pharmacokinetic PET studies in small animals	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						beta (beta) detector; blood sampling; pharmacokinetic modeling; small animal PET	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; INPUT FUNCTION; DETECTOR; MODELS; HEART	Radiotracer kinetic modeling in small animals with Positron Emission Tomography (PET) requires the determination of the blood tracer concentration as a function of time. A continuous blood counting system was designed to measure the input function from rats and mice in real time. The system consists of a flow-through 0 counter made of silicon PIN photodiodes and a mu l syringe pump. The latter draws blood continuously from an implanted venous or arterial catheter, at a user selected rate. The direct beta detection by photodiodes minimizes the shield footprint next to the animal and reduces the counter sensitivity to ambient gamma radiation. The device is entirely remote controlled for sampling protocol selection, tuning, and real time monitoring of measured parameters. It can be hooked to a computer or fully integrated with the LabPET (TM) scanner for blood counting during dynamic PET imaging experiments. The counter sensitivity to the most popular PET radioisotopes (F-18, Cu-64, N-13, 11C) ranges from 7.1 to 46.8 Bq/mu l. Its linearity is better than 98% up to 46 kBq/mu l for F-18, and a 1.4 s dispersion constant was measured at a rate of 250 mu l/min with rat whole blood in a PE10' catheter. Due to its optimized mechanical design and compact shielding, the counter sensitivity to radioactive background is only 5 counts per second (cps) for a 37 MBq F-18 source 10 cm away from the detector. Accurate time-activity curves have been obtained from rats and mice in dynamic PET imaging studies.

Rad-hard silicon diode response for photon spectrometry	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						microtomography; rad-hard silicon detectors; X-ray spectrometry	X-RAY; DETECTORS; PARTICLE	In this Paper we describe the performance of a rad-hard diode (Al/p(+)/n/n(+)/Al), developed in the framework of research and development programs for the future CMS experiment at LHC, for detection and spectrometry of X-and gamma-rays envisaging its use in characterization of porous structures by X-ray tomography., The diode's response was studied using Co-57, Ba-133, and 24 1 Am radioactive sources at room temperature. A reasonable good energy resolution was obtained in the energy range between 30 and 360 keV (FWHM = 5.2 keV and 5.7 keV, respectively). In the same energy range, measurements of full-energy peak efficiencies were carried out and compared with the theoretical values. For 59.5 keV photons the angular dependence of the efficiency was also measured. The results have demonstrated that this diode is appropriate for direct detection of low energy electromagnetic radiation.

Comparison of the effects of enriched uranium and 137-cesium on the behaviour of rats after chronic exposure	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						behavioral effect; rat; enriched uranium; 137-cesium; chronic exposure	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; SPONTANEOUS-ALTERNATION; HIPPOCAMPUS; RADIATION; STRESS; MEMORY	Purpose: A radionuclide that accumulates in the central nervous system is likely to exert both a chemical and a radiological effect. The present study aimed at assessing the behavioral effect of two radionuclides previously shown to accumulate in the central nervous system after chronic exposure - uranium and cesium. Materials and methods: Rats were exposed for 9 months to drinking water contaminated with either enriched uranium at a dosage of 40 mg U (.) l(-1) or 137-cesium at a dosage of 6500 Bq (.) l(-1), which correspond to the highest concentrations measured in some wells in the south of Finland (uranium) or in the milk in Belarus in the year following the Chernobyl accident (137-cesium). Results: At this level of exposure, 137-cesium had no effect on the locomotor activity measured in an open-field, on immobility time in a forced swimming test, on spontaneous alternation in a Y-maze and on novel object exploration in an object recognition test. Enriched uranium exposure specifically reduced the spontaneous alternation measured in the Y-maze after 3 and 9 months exposure although it did not affect the other parameters. Conclusion: Enriched uranium exposure altered the spatial working memory capacities and this effect was correlated with previously described accumulation of uranium in the hippocampus which is one of the cerebral areas involved in this memory system.

As seen by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and Electron probe micro analysis (EPMA) up to 15.86 wt% of ThO2 could be dissolved in this matrix. The homogeneity of thoria loaded glass was convincingly ascertained by EPMA. Attempts to load more than 16 wt% ThO2 led to the phase separation of crystalline phases identified as major phase of ThO2 and minor percentage of ThSiO4 Phase with altogether different morphologies, as seen by XRD. Interestingly, the back scattered images of thorite crystals point towards the presence of chemical zoning. The results being reported in this paper are of interest especially with respect to immobilization of other actinides in borosilicate glass matrix. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Role of microstructure and heat treatments on the desorption kinetics of tritium from austenitic stainless steels	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							HYDROGEN	The liquid scintillation counting of solid samples (LSC-SS technique) was successfully used to study the role of microstructure and heat treatments on the behavior of residual tritium in several austenitic stainless steels (as-cast remelted tritiated waste, 316LN and 321 steels). The role of desorption annealing in the 100-600 degrees C range on the residual amount of tritium in tritiated waste was investigated. The residual tritium concentration computed from surface activity measurements is in good agreement with experimental values measured by liquid scintillation counting after full dissolution of the samples. The kinetics of tritium desorption recorded with the LSGSS technique shows a significant desorption of residual tritium at room temperature, a strong barrier effect of thermal oxide films on the tritium desorption and a dependance of the tritium release on the steels microstructure. Annealing in the 300-600 degrees C range allows to desorb a large fraction of the residual tritium. However a significant trapping of tritium is evidenced. The influence of trapping phenomena oil the concentration of residual tritium and on its dependance with the annealing temperature was investigated with different recrystallized and sensitized micro structures. Trapping is evidenced mainly below 150 degrees C and concerns a small fraction of the total amount of tritium introduced in austenitic steels. It presumably occurs preferentially on precipitates such as Ti(CN) or on intermetallic phases. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Specimens irradiated with 500 eV He+ at 300 K show three He release peaks in the vicinity of similar to 500, similar to 1000, and similar to 1200 K. The helium is thought to form He vacancy complexes or bubbles. Increasing the specimen temperature to 700 K does not significantly affect the trapping behavior of He. Sequential He+-D+ irradiation at 300 K results in the elimination of He release above 800 K. Instead, both D and He were released in the range 400-800 K. This is interpreted as interstitial D and He released from the near surface. Sequential He+-D+ irradiation at 700 K resulted in a reduced single He peak at similar to 1000 K with very little release observed below 800 K; no D was trapped for irradiations at 700 K. Sequential D+-He+ irradiations at 300 K show that He trapping occurs in much the same manner as for the He+-only case while D retention is reduced at the near surface. Sequential D+-He+ irradiations at 700 K indicate that pre-irradiation with D+ has little or no effect on the subsequent trapping behavior of He. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The selected U3O8 pellet was prepared by sintering a U3O8 powder compact. The TGA results show that the reduction rate is fastest in H-2 gas, and X-ray diffraction indicates that U3O8 reduces to UO8+x without any intermediate phase. The reduced pellet, UO2+x, has a special grain structure that consists of equiaxed grains at the surface, columnar grains in the middle, and equiaxed grains in the center. The equiaxed grains and columnar grains are much smaller in H-2 gas than in Ar or CO2 gas. The reducing gases significantly influence the morphology of the grain structure. This difference can be explained in terms of a relation between oxygen potential and critical nucleus size during the reduction. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Although our previous model explained the qualitative trend of the measured ion current values, the absolute values of the theoretical curves were about two times as large as the measured values. In order to accurately predict the measured values, we reinforced our model by considering columnar recombination and turbulent diffusion, which affects columnar recombination. Our new model explained the considerable ion loss in the early stage of ion diffusion and narrowed the gap between the theoretical and measured values. The model also predicted suppression of ion loss due to columnar recombination by spraying a high-speed air flow near a contaminated surface. This suppression was experimentally investigated and confirmed. In conclusion, we quantitatively clarified the theoretical relation between alpha radioactivity and ion current in laminar flow and turbulent pipe flow.

The upper limit of the neutron multiplication factor of uranium and/or plutonium system that is judged to be sub-critical in consideration of calculation errors is called "estimated criticality lower-limit multiplication factor" (ECLLMF), and it should be determined by a statistical method. For benchmark results of criticality calculations depending on such parameters as uranium enrichment, H/U-235 atomic ratio and so on, an equation for determining the ECLLMF was derived by employing the statistical theories on the multiple regression analysis and non-central t-distribution. As an example, an application of the proposed formula was shown to the benchmark calculation results that were obtained for low-enriched homogeneous uranium systems with a combination of MVP II code and JENDL3.3 library.

The Krylov method is an efficient approach for solving ordinary differential equations with stiff nature such as the nuclide bunrup with short lived nuclides. Some mathematical fundamentals of the Krylov subspace method and its application to burnup equations are discussed. Verification calculations are carried out in a PWR pin-cell geometry with UO2 fuel. A detailed burnup chain that includes 193 fission products and 28 heavy nuclides is used in the verification calculations. Shortest half life found in the present burnup chain is approximately 30 s (Rh-106). Therefore, conventional methods (e.g., the Taylor series expansion with scaling and squaring) tend to require longer computation time due to numerical stiffness. Comparison with other numerical methods (e.g., the 4-th order Runge-Kutta-Gill) reveals that the Krylov subspace method can provide accurate solution for a detailed burnup chain used in the present study with short computation time.

The PATRICIA experimental program has been set up in order to investigate the clad-to-coolant heat transfer under fast transients. In this program, an Inconel tube centered in an annular channel was heated up by direct Joule effect. Both PWR Hot Zero Power conditions (15 MPa, 553 K-280 degrees C-, 4 m/s) and pool conditions similar to those of the RIA experiments performed in the NSRR reactor (atmospheric pressure, room temperature, stagnant water) have been simulated. The heating rates were representative of the clad heating induced by the fuel during a RIA transient. With respect to the steady-state conditions, an increase of the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) has been observed. Boiling curves for PWR Hot Zero Power conditions have been implemented in the SCANAIR code. Further experimental results are needed to derive a reliable model in pool conditions for the simulation of NSRR experiments. Calculations of a 4-cycle UO2 rod submitted to a 30 ms power pulse in PWR conditions show that the zirconia layer has a dominant influence on the Departure from Nucleate Boiling (DNB). Once the DNB is reached, clad temperatures of the order of 1,300 K are computed and the film boiling phase lasts several seconds.

The effects of water quality variation due to hydrazine injection on flow accelerated corrosion (FAC) of carbon steel used in the BWR feed water line should be considered from the viewpoints of radioactive exposure, radioactive waste generation and plant integrity. Optimization of oxygen injection into feed water was considered to suppress FAC during hydrazine and hydrogen co-injection. In this report, corrosion tests of carbon steel were made in hydrazine and/or dissolved oxygen injected solutions (conditions: no pH adjustment by ammonia; temperature = 215 degrees C; flow rate = 3.5 m.s(-1)) to study the effects of dissolved oxygen and hydrazine on FAC. Hydrazine and oxygen co-injection suppressed the total corrosion rate by about 1/5 compared with the case of 0 mu mol.kg(-1) hydrazine and < 0.06 mu mol.kg(-1) oxygen injection. With hydrazine and oxygen co-injection, the inner layer, which is protective oxide, was close packed. Thickness of the inner layer also became larger compared with the case for only hydrazine injection or only oxygen injection. alpha-Fe2O3, which is thermodynamically more stable than Fe3O4, was formed in addition to Fe3O4 which was the single species formed for the case of only hydrazine injection. From these results, it was concluded FAC will be suppressed by keeping the oxygen concentration at the current level in BWRs (about 1 mu mol.kg(-1)) if hydrazine and hydrogen co-injection is applied.

Radionuclides in the ocean are modeled in three phases, i.e., the dissolved phase in seawater, the adsorbed with large particulate matter (LPM) and the adsorbed with active bottom sediment. The adsorption and desorption processes between the dissolved and solid phases are solved by the stochastic method with the kinetic transfer coefficients. Deposition of the LPM and re-suspension from bottom sediment are also considered. The system was applied to simulate the long-term (24-year) dispersion of Cs-137 actually released from the BNFL spent nuclear fuel reprocessing plant at Sellafield in United Kingdom. The calculation well reproduced the main characteristics of migration of dissolved Cs-137 concentration in the Irish Sea.

Evaluation of imaging plate technique coupled with activation detector as the passive neutron monitor	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								The spatial distribution of neutrons was measured at the muon science laboratory of KEK by the activation detector method using an imaging plate for the radioactivity measurement. It was confirmed that this method is highly sensitive to detect the average neutron dose of 10 mu Sv/h. The distribution of thermal and epithermal neutrons was also measured in the experimental room. The cadmium ratio inside the experimental room is one except for the neutron leakage point. The spatial distribution of neutrons inside the concrete shield of KENS was measured by the same method. Aluminum and gold foils were used for the measurement of fast and thermal neutrons, respectively. Two dimensional change of the reaction rate of the Al-27(n,alpha)Na-24 reaction shows a good agreement with the results calculated by the Monte Carlo simulation using MARS14 code. Thermal and epithermal neutron flux ratio on the beam axis was measured by the cadmium ratio method. The flux ratios were about 30 and almost constant for every slot except for the surface of the shield, because the cadmium ratio is 2. This method was very useful to measure the activity of many pieces of detector simultaneously without any efficiency and decay correction. Wide dynamic range and high sensitivity are also the merit of this method.

Radiochemical neutron activation analysis of Mo and W in geochemical and cosmochemical samples with an emphasis on the correction of fission products	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								Radiochemical neutron activation analysis (RNAA) was applied to geochemical and cosmochemical samples to determine trace amounts of Mo and W. To determine the Mo concentration by NAA accurately, the contribution of the fission products of U should be corrected. For that reason, we developed a simple and effective method, where a contribution of fissiogenic Mo-99 was estimated by monitoring the ratio of uranium fission-product Mo-99 to I-133. Mo concentrations corrected for fission with the W concentrations were consistent with the literature values, showing that I-133 was found to be an effective monitor for fission correction. Detection limits are estimated to be 10 ppb for Mo and W and 30 ppb for U under the present experimental conditions.

Quantitative measurement of activity (and of its uncertainty) is not always simple, especially when accuracy better than a few percent is sought. Recent work with Ge-77 and As-76 has demonstrated that the accuracy of half-lives in the literature is sometimes insufficient. Despite these and other problems, quantitative understanding and documentation of uncertainties can be accomplished, providing demonstrable quality assurance and supporting claims of traceability to the Systeme International.

A general enrichment of rare earth elements (REEs), a Ce positive anomaly (partial oxidation after primary apatite dissolution) and a Eu negative anomaly (Eu2+ in plagioclases/clay minerals) are observed with increasing weathering. Mosses and lichens are Ce and Eu depleted, indicating that the main REE uptake is done via absorption from REE3+ secondary phosphates, probably together with P (essential nutrient).

Determination of plutonium and Sr-90 in air particulate samples	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							EXTRACTION CHROMATOGRAPHY; ACTINIDES; SEPARATION; URINE	Within the surveillance program of the gaseous effluents coming from the nuclear reprocessing plant EUREX of ENEA (Italian National Agency for New Technologies Energy and Environment, CR Saluggia) in the North of Italy, the content of some radionuclides is continuously monitored. The so-called 1AW high-activity liquid waste (HLLW) is the aqueous raffinate of the first cycle of PUREX extraction process which was the starting point of the reprocessing activity of some MTR and CANDU spent fuel elements. Nowadays, 1AW-HLLW is stored in five tanks placed inside the EUREX plant site. This paper describes the sampling and radioanalytical methods employed to determine the activities of Am-241, plutonium isotopes and Sr-90 in the total suspended particulate material (TSP) of the 1AW tank primary ventilation air circuit.

The core changes which were made to achieve a four-fold increase in irradiation capacity includes the introduction of a second enrichment zone, an increase in core radius and a decrease in core height. Performance tests done Lit low power, during the rise to power, and at full power, which focus oil the neutronics characteristics, are presented. These tests include the nuclear instrumentation system response, the approach to criticality and excess reactivity evaluation, control rod worth calibrations, isothermal temperature coefficient evaluation, the calibration of the nuclear instrumentation system with reactor thermal power, and the burn-up reactivity coefficient. The measurements and comparisons with calculated predictions are shown. The design predictions are consistent with the performance test results, and all technical safety specifications are satisfied. The JOYO MK-III core will provide enhanced irradiation testing capability, as well as serve as a test bed for improving fast reactor operation, performance, and safety. Through the performance test evaluation, the core characteristics of a small size sodium cooled fast reactor with a hard neutron spectrum are clarified. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Jeong, CJ; Choi, H				Jeong, Chang Joon; Choi, Hangbok			Dynamic modeling and analysis of alternative fuel cycle scenarios in Korea	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						dynamic analysis; fuel cycle; DUPIC; sodium-cooled fast reactor; accelerator driven system		The Korean nuclear fuel cycle was modeled by the dynamic analysis method, which was applied to the once-through and alternative fuel cycles. First, the once-through fuel cycle was analyzed based on the Korean nuclear power plant construction plan up to 2015 and a postulated nuclear demand growth rate of zero after 2015. Second, alternative fuel cycles including the direct use of spent pressurized water reactor fuel in Canada deuterium uranium reactors (DUPIC), a sodium-cooled fast reactor and an accelerator driven system were assessed and the results were compared with those of the once-through fuel cycle. The once-through fuel cycle calculation showed that the nuclear power demand would be 25 GWe and the amount of the spent fuel will be similar to 65000 tons by 2100. The alternative fuel cycle analyses showed that the spent fuel inventory could be reduced by more than 30% and 90% through the DUPIC and fast reactor fuel cycles, respectively, when compared with the once-through fuel cycle. The results of this study indicate that both spent fuel and uranium resources can be effectively managed if alternative reactor systems are timely implemented along with the existing reactors.

Full 3-D cluster-based iterative image reconstruction tool for a small animal PET camera	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Molecular Imaging Technology	MAY 09-12, 2006	Marseille, FRANCE	Univ Mediterranean, CERN, Govt City Marseilles, Bouches du Rhone,Gen Council Bouches, CISBIO, SCIONIX		medical imaging; image reconstruction; small animal PET		Iterative reconstruction methods are commonly used to obtain images with high resolution and good signal-to-noise ratio in nuclear imaging. The aim of this work was to develop a scalable, fast, cluster based, fully 3-D iterative image reconstruction package for our small animal PET camera, the miniPET. The reconstruction package is developed to determine the 3-D radioactivity distribution from list mode type of data sets and it can also simulate noise-free projections of digital phantoms. We separated the system matrix generation and the fully 3-D iterative reconstruction process. As the detector geometry is fixed for a given camera, the system matrix describing this geometry is calculated only once and used for every image reconstruction, making the process much faster. The Poisson and the random noise sensitivity of the ML-EM iterative algorithm were studied for our small animal PET system with the help of the simulation and reconstruction tool. The reconstruction tool has also been tested with data collected by the miniPET from a line and a cylinder shaped phantom and also a rat. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
