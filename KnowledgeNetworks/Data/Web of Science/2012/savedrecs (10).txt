Progress on the development of H-concentration probes in eutectic lead-lithium: Synthesis and characterization of electrochemical sensor materials	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 11-16, 2011	Portland, OR			Liquid blanket; Proton conducting ceramics; Sensor; Hydrogen; Tritium	LEAD-55.5-PERCENT BISMUTH ALLOY; OXYGEN SENSORS; ELECTROLYTE; FABRICATION; ZIRCONIA; BACEO3; CELL	Dynamic tritium concentration measurement in lithium-lead eutectic (17% Li-83% Pb) is of major interest for a reliable tritium testing program in ITER TBM and for an experimental proof of tritium self-sufficiency in liquid metal breeding systems. Potentiometric hydrogen sensors for molten lithium-lead eutectic have been designed at the Electrochemical Methods Lab at Institut Quimic de Sarria (IQS) at Barcelona and are under development and qualification. The probes are based on the use of solid state electrolytes and works as Proton Exchange Membranes (PEM). In this work, the following compounds have been synthesized in order to be tested as PEM H-probes: BaCeO3, BaCe0.9Y0.1O3-delta, SrCe0.9Y0.1O3-delta and Sr(Ce-0.9-Zr-0.1)(0.95)Yb0.05O3-delta. Potentiometric measurements of the synthesized ceramic elements have been performed at different hydrogen concentrations at 500 degrees C. In this campaign, a fixed and known hydrogen pressure has been used in the reference electrode. The sensors constructed using the proton conductor elements BaCeO3, SrCe0.9Y0.1O3-delta and Sr(Ce-0.9-Zr-0.1)(0.95)Yb0.05O3-delta exhibited quite stable output potential and its value was quite close to the theoretical value calculated with the Nernst equation (deviation less than 100 mV). Unstable measurement was obtained using BaCe0.9Y0.1O3-delta as a solid state electrolyte in the sensor. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effect of hydrophobic paints coating for tritium reduction in concrete materials	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 11-16, 2011	Portland, OR			Tritium; Concrete; Hydrophobic paint; Diffusion	TRITIATED-WATER; CEMENT; BEHAVIOR; SORPTION	The effects of hydrophobic paint coating on a concrete material of cement paste on the tritium transport are investigated. The cement paste is coated with two kinds of paints, acrylic-silicon resin paint and epoxy resin paint. We investigated the amount of tritium trapped in the samples exposed to tritiated water vapor by means of sorption and release. It was found that both the hydrophobic paints could reduce effectively tritium permeation during 50 days exposure of tritiated water vapor. The effect of tritium reduction of the epoxy paint was higher than that of silicon while the amount of tritium trapped in the epoxy paint was larger than that of silicon due to difference of the structure. Based on an analysis of a diffusion model, the rate-determining step of tritium migration through cement paste coated with the paints is diffusion through the paints respectively: It was found that tritium was easy to penetrate through silicon because there were many pores or voids in the silicon comparatively. In the case of tritium released from the epoxy paint, it is considered that tritium diffusion in epoxy is slow due to retardation by isotope exchange reaction to water included in epoxy paint.

A fusion-fission hybrid reactor named FDS-MFX was designated for checking and validating the DEMO reactor blanket relevant technologies. The reactor design is based on easy-achieved plasma parameters extrapolated from the successful operation of tokamaks and the subcritical blanket is designed based on the well-developed technologies of fission reactors. In this contribution, a concept of the tritium system was designed for the FDS-MFX: the tritium was extracted from LiPb by the helium purge gas which contains a small amount of hydrogen gas, then the impurity gas was removed by cold trap, finally tritium was separated from hydrogen isotope by the cryogenic distillation and supply to reactor core. On the basis of data obtained by present design and experimental research, the system parameters were presented and discussed in detail. The results preliminarily demonstrated the engineering feasibility of the design. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The LLCB TBM consists of lithium titanate as ceramic breeder (CB) material in the form of packed pebble beds. The FW structural material is ferritic martensitic steel cooled by high-pressure helium gas and lead-lithium eutectic (Pb-Li) flowing separately around the ceramic breeder pebble bed to extract the nuclear heat from the CB zones. Low-pressure helium is purged inside the CB zone for in situ extraction of bred tritium. Currently the LLCB blanket design optimization is under progress. The performance of tritium breeding and high-grade heat extraction is being evaluated by neutronic analysis and thermal-hydraulic calculations for different LLCB cooling configurations and geometrical design variants. The LLCB TBM auxiliary systems such as, helium cooling system (HCS), lead-lithium cooling system (LLCS), tritium extraction system (TES) process design are under progress. Safety analysis of the LLCB test blanket system (TBS) is under progress for the contribution to preliminary safety report of ITER-TBMs. This paper will present the status of the LLCB TBM design, process integration design (PID) of the auxiliary systems and preliminary safety analysis results.

Size of droplets formed from the nozzles was estimated by theoretical and experimental methods. For the theoretical estimation, the non-dimensional comparison of the physical bulk property of liquid Pb-17Li with water (H2O) at ambient temperature was applied. It was found to be reasonable to apply the Plateau-Rayleigh-Instability theory for the droplet size formula of the fluid Pb-17Li for the nozzle diameter 0.4 mm-1.0 mm, temperature 400 degrees C-500 degrees C, at initial velocity of 3 m/s. The experimental results of the droplet size showed good agreement with the theory. This device was used for the parametric study of extraction of deuterium during their free fall in vacuum. The scaling of the device suggests the engineering feasibility of the process. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Neutronic design analyses for a dual-coolant blanket concept: Optimization for a fusion reactor DEMO	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 11-16, 2011	Portland, OR			Blanket; Vacuum vessel; Neutronic response; Peak nuclear heating; TBR		The generation of design specifications for a DEMO reactor, including breeding blanket (BB), vacuum vessel (VV) and magnetic field coils (MFC), requires a consistent neutronic optimization of structures between plasma and MFC. This work targets iteratively to generate these neutronic specifications for a Dual-Coolant He/Pb15.7Li breeding blanket design. The iteration process focuses on the optimization of allowable space between plasma scrapped-off-layer and VV in order to generate a MFC/VV/BB/plasma sustainable configuration with minimum global system volumes. Two VV designs have been considered: (1) a double-walled option with light-weight stiffeners and (2) a thick massive one. The optimization process also involves VV materials, looking to warrant radiation impact operational limits on the MFC. The resulting nuclear responses: peak nuclear heating in toroidal field (TF) coil, tritium breeding ratio (TBR), power amplification factor and helium production in the structural material are provided.

Neutronics analysis of the IVVS/GDC plug in ITER	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 11-16, 2011	Portland, OR			ITER; Diagnostics; Neutronics; Monte Carlo; Occupational dose rates		A neutronics analysis has been performed to provide the input required for the design strategy for the In-Vessel Viewing System (IVVS) and the Glow Discharge Cleaning (GDC) plug units in the ITER tokamak. The focus of the analysis has been on operational loads to the GDC electrode head in the shielding position and on the activation and the decay photon radiation absorbed in the structural components of the entire system. To estimate the conditions for maintenance scenarios, the occupational dose rate around the isolated IVVS/GDC head has been calculated assuming the ITER SA2 irradiation scenario. The Rigorous 2 Step (R2S) method, developed previously at KIT, has been employed for the calculation of the shutdown dose rates. The GDC head, which is subjected to the highest neutron loads, gets heavily activated and dominates the decay gamma activity of the entire plug. Accordingly, the shutdown dose rate around the IVVS/GDC plug is dominated by the GDC electrode head. It is therefore recommended to separate the GDC head from the system prior to further operations inside the Hot Cell. All components, except the Be protective layer of the GDC probe, were shown to be classifiable as low level radwaste according to the French regulations. (C) 2012 Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

Preliminary results from a detritiation facility dedicated to soft housekeeping waste	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 11-16, 2011	Portland, OR			Housekeeping; Detritiation; Tritium; Membrane reactor	MECHANICAL DESIGN; PERMCAT REACTOR; TECHNICAL PERMCAT; VALIDATION; SYSTEM; TESTS; ITER	Nuclear waste management has to be taken into account for fusion machine in tritium experimentations. Soft housekeeping waste is produced during both operating and dismantling phases and is contaminated by tritium under reduced (HT) and oxidized (HTO) forms. At CEA Cadarache, a lab-scaled facility has been built for soft housekeeping detritiation. The tritiated gas exhausted from the process described above is foreseen to be treated by a tubular Pd-Ag membrane reactor, for gaseous tritium recovery. Since this membrane reactor uses hydrogen as swamping gas the compatibility toward explosive hazard has to be taken into account. Then, this work presents a double objective. A first study is presented in order to identify the best conditions for the declassification of soft housekeeping waste, without tritium recovery. Experiments carried out at 120 degrees C are not efficient enough and do not allow one to choose the most efficient carrier gas. Some other tests are being currently performed at higher temperatures (150 degrees C). Moreover, due to safety issues, the use of air has to be avoided during membrane reactor implementation phase. Preliminary results obtained with hydrogen hazard-free carrier gases are also presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Development of a technical scale PERMCAT reactor for processing of highly tritiated water	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 11-16, 2011	Portland, OR			Fuel cycle; Tritiated water; Catalytic membrane reactor; Palladium membrane	MEMBRANE REACTOR; SIMULATION; DESIGN; TESTS	In view of future fusion rectors fueled by deuterium-tritium mixtures, highly tritiated water (HTW) of up to 5.2.10(16) Bq kg(-1) will be produced, during routine operation and scenarios as an accidental release of tritium into a glove box. Also in the solid breeder blanket concept, a non-negligible fraction of the tritium produced will be in the tritiated water fraction. To decontaminate HTW the PERMCAT using isotope swamping in a Pd/Ag membrane reactor has been identified as a robust and reliable solution. In order to investigate the decontamination of HTW at flow rates relevant for future fusion power plants, a technical scale, fully tritium compatible PERMCAT consisting of a bundle of finger-type membranes inserted in a single catalyst bed was developed. Nevertheless, it represents only one part of a PERMCAT cascade necessary to achieve the required performance to process HTW on technical scale. By improving the existing PERMCAT geometry using experimental data obtained from isotopic exchange between D2O and H-2, the performance of the existing PERMCAT reactor was optimised. Based on the optimised geometry a new fully tritium compatible technical scale PERMCAT cascade comprising of two PERMCAT reactors in series was designed, manufactured and commissioned as presented in this paper.

To fulfill these requirements, it is mandatory to test the port plugs at operating temperature before installation on the machine and after refurbishment. The ITER port plug test facility (PFTF) provides the possibility to test upper and equatorial port plugs before installation on the machine. The port plug test facility is composed of several test stands. These test stands are first used in the domestic agencies and on the ITER Organization site to test the port plugs at the end of manufacturing. Two of these stands are installed later in the ITER hot cell facility to test the port plugs after refurbishment. The port plugs to be tested are the Ion Cyclotron (IC) heating and current drive antennas, Electron Cyclotron (EC) heating and current drive launchers, diagnostics and test blanket modules port plugs. Test stands shall be capable to perform environmental and functional tests. The test stands are composed of one vacuum tank (3.3 m in diameter, 5.6 m long) and the associated heating, vacuum and control systems. The vacuum tank shall achieve an ultimate pressure of 1 x 10(-5) Pa at 100 degrees C containing a port plug. The heating system shall provide water at 240 degrees C and 4.4 MPa to heat up the port plugs. Openings are provided on the back of the vacuum tank to insert probes for the functional tests. This paper describes the tests to be performed on the port plugs and the conceptual design of the port plug test facility. The configuration of the standalone test stands and the integration in the hot cell facility are presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Levesy, B.; Beaumont, B.; Cordier, J.

Two types of electrodes-pasted and electroless plated electrodes-were used to evaluate the mass transfer process. When the hydrogen pump was operated using direct current, the voltage between electrodes under vacuum was less than that under atmospheric pressure, regardless of electrode type. This result indicates that the hydrogen pump performance is improved under vacuum. In the case of the pasted electrode, however, the voltage decrease was larger than that in the case of the plated electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that the diffusivity in the pasted electrode was smaller under atmospheric pressure than under vacuum. From comparing the microstructures of the two electrode types, the pasted electrode has larger pores and would be more suitable for the hydrogen pump under vacuum. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The obtained data were discussed with crystal structure of the carbon film. The T/C increased with decreasing D/C of carbon film. The carbon film with low D/C had more defective structure. The reduction of D/C by the heating before tritium exposure led to the increase of absorption amount. These results suggest that carbon film with more defective structure and low D/C film could absorb large amount of tritium.

The depth profiles of deuterium could be measured with sufficient resolution in the presence of relatively large amounts of hydrogen and vice versa. in addition, measurements of depth profiles of He implanted in W at room temperature were also performed with Ne plasma. The intensity of the He emissions was sufficiently high at a fluence of 10(20) He m(-2) or higher. The depth profiles of He measured in this manner were in good agreement with the results of cross-sectional observations using a transmission electron microscope. Therefore, it was concluded that GDOES with Ne plasma is a promising technique for the depth profile analysis of plasma-facing materials and deposited layers formed on them. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Study on oxidation of hydrogen over commercial catalyst for tritium recovery system	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 11-16, 2011	Portland, OR			Catalyst; Tritium; Oxidation; Adsorption; Water vapor		For the establishment of the D-T fusion reactor technology, recovery of tritium released into the working area of fusion power plants is quite important. When tritium leaks to working areas, the last barrier is the wall of the building. Due to higher diffusion coefficient of tritium, it diffuses through the wall and would be readily liberated to the environment. Thus, the tritium recovery system is indispensable for the D-T fusion reactor. The objective of the present study is to develop the advanced technology of the tritium recovery system. In the near future, deuterium plasma discharge experiments scheduled be conducted with Large Helical Device (LHD) in National Institute for Fusion Science. A small amount of tritium is produced by D-D reaction in LHD. Tritium in plasma exhaust gases and process gas during discharge needs to be recovered, and thus the design and construction of the tritium recovery system used for that purpose is a matter of considerable urgency. The tritium recovery system usually consists of catalysts and adsorbents, which is the most conventional and reliable method for removing tritium that is accidentally released into the working area of these facilities. However, more recent and advanced type of catalysts on the market cannot be directly applied to the design of tritium recovery system, because of paucity of design data for tritium recovery system. In this study, the authors performed oxidation experiments of hydrogen over a catalyst. The experiments were performed by changing various experimental parameters. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Neutronic design of Indian LLCB TBM	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 11-16, 2011	Portland, OR			LLCB; TBM; Neutronics; Plate design; Tube design; Nuclear heating; Tritium production rate		India is developing lead lithium cooled ceramic breeder (LLCB) TBM to be tested in ITER. Liquid lead lithium along with lithium titanate has been adopted as basic material in Indian TBM for neutron multiplication and tritium breeding. RAFMS is used as the structural material and the first wall is cooled by helium. Li-6 enrichment is taken as 60 and 90% in lithium titanate and lead lithium, respectively. The LLCB TBM design is under progress and two design variants are being considered viz, plate design and tube design. In plate design the lead lithium and lithium titanate zones are arranged alternatively and are parallel to the first wall of TBM. In tube design circular tubes of RAFMS are assumed parallel to first wall and lead lithium flows inside the tubes or outside the tubes and lithium titanate is placed accordingly. For the neutronic design of the LLCB TBM, a detailed 3D neutronic model with "look alike" LLCB TBM in equatorial port in ITER has been constructed. A 3D neutron source has been used for the D-T neutrons emitted by plasma. Neutronic study is carried out using Monte Carlo transport code with FENDL-2.1 library with the following objectives: (1) to examine the profiles of heating and tritium production rates in the LLCB TBM, both in the radial and toroidal direction, in order to identify locations where neutronics measurements can be best performed with least perturbation from the surroundings, (2) to provide both local and integrated values for nuclear heating rates required for subsequent thermo-mechanical analysis, and (3) to compare the tritium production capabilities of two variants of the geometries. This paper will present the main findings from this neutronic study. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Gathibandhe, M. V.; Agrawal, R. A.; Vyas, K.

Overview of the US-Japan collaborative investigation on hydrogen isotope retention in neutron-irradiated and ion-damaged tungsten	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 11-16, 2011	Portland, OR			Neutron-irradiation; Tungsten; Tritium retention; Ion-damage; Linear plasma device; Neutron	DEUTERIUM RETENTION	The effect of neutron-irradiation damage has been mainly simulated using high-energy ion bombardment. A recent MIT report (PSFC/RR-10-4, An assessment of the current data affecting tritium retention and its use to project towards T retention in ITER, Lipschultz et al., 2010) summarizes the observations from high-energy ion bombardment studies and illustrates the saturation trend in deuterium concentration due to damage from ion irradiation in tungsten and molybdenum above 1 displacement per atom (dpa). While this prior database of results is quite valuable for understanding the behavior of hydrogen isotopes in plasma facing components (PFCs), it does not encompass the full range of effects that must be considered in a practical fusion environment due to short penetration depth, damage gradient, high damage rate, and high primary knock-on atom (PKA) energy spectrum of the ion bombardment. In addition, neutrons change the elemental composition via transmutations, and create a high radiation environment inside PFCs, which influences the behavior of hydrogen isotope in PFCs, suggesting the utilization of fission reactors is necessary for neutron-irradiation. Under the framework of the US-Japan TITAN program, tungsten samples (99.99 at.% purity from A.LM.T. Co.) were irradiated by fission neutrons in the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), at 50 and 300 degrees C to 0.025, 0.3, and 2.4 dpa, and the investigation of deuterium retention in neutron-irradiated tungsten was performed in the Tritium Plasma Experiment (TPE), the unique high-flux linear plasma facility that can handle tritium, beryllium and activated materials. This paper reports the recent results from the comparison of ion-damaged tungsten via various ion species (2.8 MeV Fe2+, 20 MeV W2+, and 700 keV H-) with that from neutron-irradiated tungsten to identify the similarities and differences among them.

In order to develop an effective chromatographic packing, effects of the diameter of the packing particle on the transport phenomena in the particle were investigated by numerical simulation. Transient change of the concentration profiles in the both solution phase and resin phase were obtained and lithium-6 enrichment in the resin phase was well simulated. A dimensionless coefficient, which represents a ratio of the diffusive mass transfer rate to the adsorption rate, was found in the mass balance equation. The magnitude of the factor was also evaluated for various values of diameter of the packing particle. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Overview of R&D at TLK for process and analytical issues on tritium management in breeder blankets of ITER and DEMO	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 11-16, 2011	Portland, OR			Breeder blanket; Fuel cycle; Pd and zeolite membrane; Catalytic membrane reactor; Raman and BIXS spectroscopy	LABORATORY-KARLSRUHE; GAS-CHROMATOGRAPHY; MECHANICAL DESIGN; TECHNICAL PERMCAT; MEMBRANE REACTOR; TRITIATED-WATER; FUEL-CYCLE; SYSTEMS; DETRITIATION; RECOVERY	Safe, reliable, and efficient tritium management in the breeder blanket will have to face unprecedented technological challenges. Beside the efficiency for tritium recovery from the breeder blanket (Tritium Extraction (TES) and Coolant Purification Systems (CPS)), the accuracy for tritium tracking between the inner and the outer fuel cycle must also be demonstrated. This paper focuses on the recent R&D carried out at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe to tackle these issues. For ITER, the recently consolidated TES and CPS designs comprise adsorption columns and getter beds operated in semi-continuous mode. Different approaches for the tritium accountancy stage (TAS) have been evaluated. Balancing static (batch-wise gas collection at the TBM outlets and the tritium plant) or dynamic (in/on-line) approaches with respect to the expected analytical performances and integration issues, the first conceptual design of the TAS for EU TBMs is presented. For DEMO, the overall strategy for tritium recovery and tracking has been revisited. The necessity for on-line real-time tritium accountancy and improved process efficiency suggest the use of continuous processes such as permeator and catalytic membrane reactor. The main benefits combining the PERMCAT process with advanced membranes is discussed with respect to process improvements and facilitated accountancy using spectroscopic methods.

Activation analyses updating the ITER radioactive waste assessment	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 11-16, 2011	Portland, OR			Radioactive waste; Neutronics; Activation; ITER	MANAGEMENT	A study is reported which computes the radiation transport and activation response throughout the ITER machine and updates the ITER radioactive waste assessment using modern 3D models and up-to-date methods. The latest information on component design, maintenance, replacement schedules and materials is adopted. The radwaste classification is revised for all the major components of ITER, as well as several representative port plugs. Results include categorisation snapshots at different decay times, time histories of radiological quantities throughout the machine, and guidelines on interim decay times for components. All plasma-facing materials except tungsten are found to classify as type B due to the transmutation of their main constituents. Major contributors to the IRAS index of all materials are reported. Elemental concentration limits for type A classification of first wall and divertor materials are obtained; for the steels, only a reduction in service lifetime can reduce the waste class. Comparison of total waste amounts with earlier assessments is limited by the fact that analyses of some components are still preliminary; the trend, however, indicates a potential reduction in the total amount of waste if component segregation is demonstrated.

Hence, tritium generation and recovery studies on lithium ceramics packed bed have been started by using fusion neutron source (FNS) in Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA). Lithium titanate (Li2TiO3) was selected as tritium breeding material, and its packed bed was enclosed by the beryllium blocks, and was kept at certain temperature during fusion neutron irradiation. During irradiation, the packed bed was purged with the sweep gas continuously, and tritium released was trapped in each gas absorber selectively by chemical form. In this work, the effect of sweep gas species on tritium release behavior was investigated. In the case of sweep by helium with 1% of hydrogen, tritium in water form was released sensitively corresponding to the irradiation. This is due to existence of the water vapor in the sweep gas. On the other hand, in the case of sweep by helium without water vapor, tritium in gaseous form was released first, and release of tritium in water form was delayed from gaseous tritium and was gradually increased.

Processing highly tritiated water desorbed from molecular sieve bed using PERMCAT	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 11-16, 2011	Portland, OR			Highly tritiated water; Tritiated water processing; PERMCAT; Zeolites; Adsorption/desorption; Regeneration	TRITIUM LABORATORY KARLSRUHE; SYSTEMS; REACTOR; DESIGN	Tritium handling facilities use molecular sieve beds (MSB) to collect and recover tritiated water. After reaching the capacity limit of the MSB, the water is desorbed and decontaminated in a water detritiation system (WDS). In the case of highly tritiated water ( HTW) absorbed into a MSB, an inherent safe option for processing is necessary due to the HTW specific properties. Ideally, HTW should be processed immediately in a continuous mode. With this in consideration, the water desorption process from a zeolite bed was developed and optimized in a dedicated non active facility. The results of this experiments were applied into the regeneration of a MSB previously loaded with HTW containing an activity of 1.9 x 10(14) Bq kg(-1). The water was desorbed, by step increasing the temperature bed and fed by helium carrier gas into the PERMCAT for detritiation and tritium recovery. The processed water was collected in a dry MSB downstream of the PERMCAT. These initial studies successfully demonstrate the viability of the process.

Used blanket and divertor need to be replaced shortly after the shutdown for high plant availability, as long as high surface dose rate and decay heat of the blanket and divertor can be handled. In this sense, nuclear characteristics of the blanket and divertor need to be understood for a reasonable maintenance scheme. For the purpose, neutronic calculations were carried out on the blanket and divertor using a THIDA-2 code with FENDL-2.0. For a SlimCS DEMO reactor, the calculated decay heat for each 1/12-sector was as high as 5 MW just after the shutdown and 0.3 MW one month later. For the maintenance, a cooled shielding structure (CSS) was proposed to remove the decay heat and to shield gamma-rays from the sector. When maintenance is done one month after the shutdown, the sector temperature is maintained to be 550 degrees C or lower with the cooling by the CSS of 50 degrees C. In order to avoid tritium release from the sector during the maintenance, a cask should be used to transport the sector. For efficient use of resources, breeding and neutron multiplying materials should be reused or recycled. A possible strategy for reuse or recycle is also presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This concept combines the merits of a small-size MFE reactor and a dry-wall IFE reactor and aims at sufficient amount of tritium production and electricity generation without advanced technology. Design window analysis shows a NIF-scale (5m chamber radius) dry-wall laser fusion reactor with a similar to 1 GWth fusion output and net tritium breeding ratio (TBR) of 1.74 can sustain an MFE power plant with a fusion power of 3 GWth and net TBR of 0.96. Although more detailed quantitative analyses are required, this concept can be a possible solution for a simultaneous achievement of tritium self-sufficiency and significant net electricity generation.

We have experimentally determined mass-transfer properties by an unsteady permeation method, which data are necessary to design a system to recover tritium (T) from a Pb-Li blanket. An experiment of simultaneous H and D permeation through Li17Pb83 is performed to clarify interactions between atoms in the two-component permeation process. The experimental results are analyzed by a model of one-dimensional or two-dimensional permeation through Li17Pb83. The major permeation proceeds in the longitudinal direction of the present system, and the ratio of hydrogen leak in the radial direction is evaluated using the simulation. As a result, it was found that H and D atoms permeate independently regardless of the H/D component ratio within the present experimental conditions. The permeability and diffusivity of H are 1.4 times higher than that of D. The solubility of H is close to that of D. The isotope effect in diffusivity is in proportion to the square root of the mass ratio of D to H. When these data can be extended to the case of T, T permeability and diffusivity is predicted as 1/1.7 times lower than that of H in the temperature range from 773 K to 973 K. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Numerical modeling and design of supercritical CO2 pre-cooler for fusion nuclear reactors	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 11-16, 2011	Portland, OR			Feher cycle; PCHE; Supercritical CO2	TURBINE	One of the key issues of fusion technology is the efficient recovery of the fusion power extracted by heat transfer fluids in the breeding blanket. The Spanish National Program TECNO_FUS is exploring a dual-coolant breeding blanket design concept and its plant auxiliary systems for a future power reactor (DEMO), with liquid lead-lithium as main primary nuclear power recovering fluid. Supercritical CO2 is chosen for the secondary circuit, since its high efficiency at significantly lower required temperatures than for the Brayton helium cycle, due to low compression work near the critical point and also because its additional major benefits in terms of tritium control. Use of printed circuit heat exchangers (PCHE) is suggested in literature due to its highly compact design and robustness for the high pressures found. This work deals with the heat exchanger devoted to release the thermal energy of the power cycle to the thermal sink. The aim of this work is analyzing how the nearness of the CO2 to its critical point affects the performance of the heat exchanger. Computer Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations that include the complex thermal behavior of CO2 properties at supercritical conditions are used in order to achieve an accurate approach to the design of this heat exchanger. These results are compared with others obtained through correlations found in the open literature. The behavior of CO2 close to its critical point results in an inefficient use of the exchange area, giving a temperature profile in CO2 which remembers a condensation process and an overall heat transfer coefficient 1.4 times higher than the one achieved with literature correlations design.

During the experiment, surfaces of metal piping except gold plating one were oxidized at the heavy water boundary and then deuterium would generate by the oxidation reactions. This deuterium could be detected by mass spectrometer, which monitored the inside gases of the piping under continuous evacuation. The result showed clearly that the deuterium permeated through Fe, Ni, and SS304 piping was detected as mainly deuterium gas (D-2) under continuous evacuation, though that through gold plating one could not be detected effectively. The D-2 permeation rate through Fe, Ni, and SS304 piping reached equilibrium conditions with oxide generation at D2O-metal boundary, although concluding the transfer mechanism will require further testing and modeling activities.

Design of a multipurpose laboratory scale apparatus for the investigation of hydrogen isotopes in PbLi and permeation technologies	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 11-16, 2011	Portland, OR			Hydrogen solubility in PbLi; Sievert's constant; HCLL blanket; Hydrogen permeation	LITHIUM-LEAD ALLOYS; SOLUBILITY	The knowledge of the tritium transport parameters in lead lithium is fundamental for the design of the HCLL (helium cooled lead lithium) blanket. In fact, the inventory of tritium in fusion reactors blankets and the permeation of tritium into the blanket coolant, with the consequent leaks toward the environment, are strongly depending on its solubility and diffusivity in the lead alloy PbLi. Several experiments, devoted to investigate the function linking the tritium solubilised in lead lithium with the corresponding tritium partial pressure at equilibrium, were carried out in the past, but significant uncertainties still remain. A detailed analysis of the past experimental works is carried out in this paper with the aim to investigate the main problems occurred in the facilities used to measure the tritium solubility in PbLi that caused such a big spread in the achieved results. On the basis of this analysis, a new a multipurpose laboratory scale apparatus has been designed. The apparatus is able to measure the tritium solubility and diffusivity in PbLi in the range of temperature 300-550 degrees C and it will be operated with hydrogen partial pressure in the range 10(2)-10(4) Pa. The facility can work with desorption and absorption technique. Moreover, the apparatus has been designed to allow the testing of H/D concentration sensors in Pb-15.7Li in operative conditions relevant to the HCLL-TBM and the characterisation of hydrogen permeation barrier.

Progress in the integration of Test Blanket Systems in ITER equatorial port cells and in the interfaces definition	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 11-16, 2011	Portland, OR			Breeding blanket; TBM; TBS; ITER		In the framework of the TBM Program, three ITER vacuum vessel equatorial ports (#16, #18 and #02) have been allocated for the testing of up to six mock-ups of six different DEMO tritium breeding blankets. Each one is called a Test Blanket System (TBS). A TBS consists mainly of the Test Blanket Module (TBM), the in-vessel component facing the plasma, and several ancillary systems, in particular the cooling system and the tritium extraction system. Each port accommodates two TBMs and therefore the two TBSs have to share the corresponding port cell. This paper deals with the design integration aspects of the two TBSs in each port cell performed at ITER Organization (10) with the corresponding definition of interfaces with other ITER systems. The performed activities have raised several issues that are discussed in the paper and for which design solutions are proposed. (C) 2012 ITER Organization. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Deuterium permeation in tungsten by mixed ion irradiation	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 11-16, 2011	Portland, OR			Tungsten; Ion driven permeation; Helium; Carbon; Mixed ion irradiation; First walls of blankets	DRIVEN PERMEATION; HYDROGEN TRANSPORT; CARBON IMPURITY; STEADY-STATE; DIFFUSION; BEHAVIOR; SURFACE; METALS; BEAM; RECOMBINATION	Deuterium ion driven permeation was studied for mixed ion irradiation conditions with He and C. Addition of He greatly reduced permeation, while addition of C enhanced permeation. These phenomena are strongly temperature dependent, but both are significant around surface temperature of blankets (similar to 800 K). Permeation flux has very weak dependence on microstructure. These results are important for evaluation of T behavior in blanket first walls. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Ueda, Y.; Lee, H. T.; Peng, H.

For the TBM testing and evaluation toward DEMO blanket, the module fabrication technology development by a candidate structural material, reduced activation martensitic/ferritic steel, F82H, is one of the most critical items from the viewpoint of realization of TBM testing in ITER. In Japan, fabrication of a real scale first wall, side walls, a breeder pebble bed box and assembling of the first wall and side walls have succeeded. Recently, the real scale partial mockup of the back wall was fabricated. The fabrication procedure of the back wall, whose thickness is up to 90 mm, was confirmed toward the fabrication of the real scale back wall by F82H. Important key technologies are almost clarified for the fabrication of the real scale TBM module mockup. From the view point of testing and evaluation, development of the technology of the blanket tritium recovery, development of advanced breeder and multiplier pebbles and the development of the blanket neutronics measurement technology are also performed. Also, tritium production and recovery test using D-T neutron in the Fusion Neutronics Source (FNS) facility has been started as the verification test of tritium production performance. This paper overviews the recent achievements of the development of the WCCB TBM in Japan. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An advance process of aluminum rich coating as tritium permeation barrier on 321 steel workpiece	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 11-16, 2011	Portland, OR			Al-electrodeposition in ionic liquid; TPB; 321 steel pieces	DRIVEN DEUTERIUM PERMEATION	We have proposed an advance three-step process, Al-electroplating in ionic liquid followed by heat treating and selectively oxidation, preparing aluminum rich coating as tritium permeation barrier (TPB). In present work, the advance process was applied to 321 steel workpieces. In the Al-electroplating, pieces were coated by galvanostatic electrodeposition at 20 mA/cm(2) in aluminum chloride (AlCl3)-1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (EMIC) ionic liquid. The Al coating on those pieces all displayed attractive brightness and well adhered to surface of pieces. Within the aluminizing time from 1 to 30 h, a series of experiments were carried out to aluminize 321 steel pieces with Al 20 mu m coating at 700 degrees C. After heat treated for 8 h, a 30 mu m thick aluminized coating on piece appeared homogeneous, free of porosity, and mainly consisted of (Fe, Cr, Ni)Al-2, and then was selectively oxidized in argon gas at 700 degrees C for 50h to form Al2O3 scale. The finally fabricated aluminum rich coating, without any visible defects, had a double-layered structure consisting of an outer gamma-Al2O3 layer with thickness of 0.2 mu m and inner (Fe, Cr, Ni)All(Fe, Cr, Ni)(3)Al layer of 50 mu m thickness. The deuterium permeation reduction factor, PRF, of piece (Phi 80 x 2, L 150 mm) with such coating increased by 2 orders of magnitude at 600-727 degrees C. The reproducibility of the process was also showed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Zhang, G. K.; Chen, C. A.; Luo, D. L.; Wang, X.

The operational record of the molten salt reactor with F-Li-Be was very successful, so the F-Li-Be blanket was chosen for research. The molten salt has several features which are suited for the fusion-fission applications. The fuel material uranium and thorium were dissolved in the F-Li-Be molten salt. A combined program, COUPLE, was used for neutronics analysis of the molten salt blanket. Several cases have been calculated and compared. Not only the influence of the different fuels have been studied, but also the thickness of the molten salt, and the concentration of the Li-6 in the molten salt. Preliminary studies indicate that when thorium-uranium-plutonium fuels were added into a F-Li-Be molten salt blanket and with a component of 71% LiF-2% BeF2-13.5% ThF4-8.5% UF4-5% PuF3. and also with the molten salt thickness of 40 cm and natural concentration of 6Li, the appropriate blanket energy multiplication factor and TBR can be obtained. The result shows that thorium-uranium molten salt can be used in the blanket of a fusion-fission symbiotic reactor. The research on the molten salt blanket must be valuable for the design of fusion-fission symbiotic reactor. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, sorption/desorption behaviors of hydrogen isotopes when tungsten deposits were exposed to deuterium gas or deuterium plasma at 300 degrees C were investigated. Samples of tungsten deposits were produced by the sputtering method using hydrogen plasma. After deuterium gas exposure or deuterium plasma exposure, the desorption behavior of hydrogen isotopes from the deposit was observed by the thermal desorption spectroscopy method. It was found that not a small amount of deuterium is retained in tungsten deposit by not only the plasma exposure but also the gas exposure while the amount of hydrogen incorporated in the deposit during sputter-deposition process is reduced. The amount of deuterium retained in the deposit by the plasma exposure was larger than that by the gas exposure in the experimental conditions in this work. The amount of hydrogen left after deuterium plasma exposure was larger than that after deuterium gas exposure. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is showed that the significant amount of tritium was absorbed in the surface of deposition sample in comparison with that of original sample, which was also supported by the results of imaging plate (IP) measurements. In addition, it was found that drastic decrease in tritium retention appeared by lowering exposure temperature, and the trapped tritium was maintained stably with time. Computer simulation is used to analyze the details of depth profile of tritium in different kinds of samples. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The SlimCS, designed in JAEA, adopts the horizontal sector transport hot cell maintenance scheme. In order to determine the most appropriate DEMO reactor maintenance scheme, it is important to assess the various maintenance schemes. In this paper the vertical sector transport maintenance concept is proposed for the first time. In the sector maintenance scheme, the amount of cutting/re-welding of the piping is minimized. The sector including blanket modules and a high-temperature shield was divided into 10 degrees segments in a toroidal direction. The sectors are designed to be removed and re-inserted through upper alternate vertical maintenance ports. In the case of the vertical sector transport maintenance scheme, inter-coil structures could be adopted for use against turnover force in toroidal field (TF) coils. This shows an advantage in DEMO maintenance compared with horizontal sector transport. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We list design rules and put forward a primary concept blanket, with uranium alloy as fuel and water as coolant. The uranium fuel can be natural uranium, LWR spent fuel, or depleted uranium. The FFHER design can increase the utilization rate of uranium in a comparatively simple way to sustain the development of nuclear energy. We study the interaction between the fusion neutron and the uranium fuel with the aim of to achieving greater energy multiplication and tritium sustainability. We also review other concept hybrid reactor designs. We design integral neutron experiments in order to verify the credibility of our proposed physical design. The combination of this program of research with the related thermal hydraulic design, alloy fuel manufacture, and nuclear fuel cycle programs provides the science and technology foundation for the future development of the FFHER concept in China.

The method is based on a combustion technique using the 307 PerkinElmer (R) Sample Oxidizer model. The hydraulic oil samples must be processed prior to counting to avoid color quenching (the largest source of inaccuracy) because these samples absorb in the region of 200-500 nm, where scintillation phosphors emit. Prior to combustion of the hydraulic oil waste, tritium recovery degree and tritium retention degree in the circuits of combustion system were evaluated as higher than 98% and less than 0.08%, respectively. After combustion, tritium activity was measured by a 2100 Tri-Care (R) Packard model liquid scintillation analyzer. The blank counts were 16.25 +/- 0.50 counts/min, measured for 60 min. The significant activity level value was 6.53 counts/min, at a preselected confidence level of 95%. The Minimum Detectable Activity of a 0.2 mL hydraulic oil sample was calculated to 1.09 Bq/mL. Therefore, the developed method is sensitive enough for the tritium evaluation in the ordinary hydraulic oil waste samples. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Tritium generated by its side reaction needs to be recovered from liquid Li for safety. Y hot trap is expected as an effective purification system to recover tritium from the liquid Li loop. In IFMIF, since liquid Li circulates in a loop, it is important to trace tritium behavior in 1, and liquid Li under dynamic conditions. In this study, the authors investigate the effectiveness of tritium recovery from liquid Li under dynamic conditions of Y hot trap. Hydrogen absorption in Li instead of tritium is investigated under dynamically fluidized conditions by stirring liquid Li with an arbitrary rotational rate. The experimental results prove that the hydrogen absorption rate from liquid Li to Y is independent of the rotational rate. This means that the rate-determining step is hydrogen diffusion in Y.

Optimizing tritium extraction from a Permeator Against Vacuum (PAV) by dimensional design using different tritium transport modeling tools	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 11-16, 2011	Portland, OR			Tritium extraction modeling; TES; Permeator; PAV		The Permeator Against Vacuum (PAV) has been conceived as the simplest, cost effective and reliable technology system dedicated to tritium extraction from breeding liquid metals. An optimal design of a PAV requires a detailed hydraulic design optimization for established operational ranges (HCLL at low velocities of similar to 1 mm/s or DCLL in the ranges of tens of cm/s). The present work analyses the PAV extraction efficiency dependency on the design parameters as optimum on-line Tritium Extraction System (TES). Three different models have been built for that purpose: one through physically refined 1D tritium transport computation usingTMAP7 (unique simulation tool with QA for ITER); and two further detailed models on 20/3D FEM tool (COMSOL Multi-physics 4.0).

Tritium clouds environmental impact in air into the Western Mediterranean Basin evaluation	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 11-16, 2011	Portland, OR			CEDE; EDE; Tritium concentration in air; Organically bound tritium in surface		The paper considers short-term releases of tritium (mainly but not only tritium hydride (HT)) to the atmosphere from a potential ITER-like fusion reactor located in the Mediterranean Basin and explores if the short range legal exposure limits are exceeded (both locally and downwind). For this, a coupled Lagrangian ECMWF/FLEXPART model has been used to follow real time releases of tritium. This tool was analyzed for nominal tritium operational conditions under selected incidental conditions to determine resultant local and Western Mediterranean effects, together with hourly observations of wind, to provide a short-range approximation of tritium cloud behavior. Since our results cannot be compared with radiological station measurements of tritium in air, we use the NORMTRI Gaussian model. We demonstrate an overestimation of the sequence of tritium concentrations in the atmosphere, close to the reactor, estimated with this model when compared with ECMWF/FLEXPART results. A Gaussian "mesoscale" qualification tool has been used to validate the ECMWF/FLEXPART for winter 2010/spring 2011 with a database of the HT plumes. It is considered that NORMTRI allows evaluation of tritium-in-air-plume patterns and its contribution to doses. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Overview of Russian Federation activity on the LLCB TBM design and analysis	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 11-16, 2011	Portland, OR			Test blanket module; Lead-lithium; Ceramic breeder; Transient thermal analysis; MHD pressure drops; Tritium breeding rate		According to the Technical program of cooperation between the leading research institutes of India and Russian Federation the joint development of lead-lithium ceramic breeder (LLCB) test blanket module (TBM) is one of preferential directions in this program. The concept of LLCB TBM and corresponding DEMO blanket has been proposed by Indian TBM Team and India is a "Leader" in this concept. Russian Federation takes part in the design, analysis and R&D activities on LLCB TBM concept on the rights of "Partner". In particular the joint efforts are focused now on the development of LLCB TBM in the electromagnetic option (so-called EM-TBM). In the framework of the design and analysis for LLCB TBM several design options have been considered by RF specialists during 2010-2011 period. The main directions of design and analysis works are as follows: the designing of TBM load-bearing casing including the reliable cooling layout; the development of tritium breeding zone (TBZ) basing upon the minimizing of MHD-pressure drops for liquid metal circulation, increasing of eutectic outlet temperature (up to 500 degrees C) and tritium production rate: to create the TBM attachment system that will be able to withstand the loads for all the ITER operation modes; thermal hydraulic analyses for TBM helium cooling system and eutectic circuit (taking into account the magnetic field conditions); Brief results of this activity and consequent proposals on the design improvements are presented in this paper. The critical issues and further plans on the development of LLCB TBM in Russian Federation are also discussed and analyzed in this article. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Leshukov, A.

Permeator against vacuum (PAV) runs as a single-step process for tritium on-line recovery, acts as passive systems allowing to be thermally governed can be easily in-pipe integrated in LiPb loop systems and can be conceived with high compactness. An optimal PAV design is proposed with detailed design parameterization of tritium recovery efficiency at different velocity ranges from numerical simulation based on properly developed Openfoam (R) CFD code BelFoam (R) customized solver. Diverse structural design options are being considered to manufacture the PAV component that presents diverse manufacturing concerns. Fabrication options are exploring rolling of thin plate with internal armor in the vacuum gap up to the coating of a porous controlled thick wall.

The special magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problems of liquid metal LiPb coolant in the DWT blanket are caused by the "banana shape" blanket module. The MHD effects of liquid metal LiPb fluid have been analysed and simulated by using computation fluid dynamics (CFD) software FLUENT added MHD user subroutine. The velocity profile and pressure distribution of LiPb flow in bend channels have been presented. The effect of wall conductance ratio of wall, including electrically insulting coating, electrically insulated flow channel insert (FCI) and electrically conducting wall, on flow velocity is analyzed.

These diagnostics are relevant for solving diagnostic tasks of International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). The paper discusses the principles of designing the magnetic measurement instrumentation based on the application of steady-state radiation-resistant semiconductor Hall sensors. It also presents the results of the instrumentation's application for ex-vessel magnetic field measurement on JET reactor during the latest deuterium campaign, and the prospects of further enhancement in magnetic diagnostic accuracy and reliability. Since neutron fluxes are much larger on ITER, at ex-vessel sensor locations, than those achievable on JET, the sensors have been tested in ITER-relevant radiation environment in nuclear research reactors.

We need to develop an x-ray imaging system which can operate in the hard radiative background generated by an ignition shot of ICF. The scintillator is a part of the imaging system and has to gather a compromise of scintillating properties (scintillating efficiency, decay time, emission wavelength) so as to both operate in the hard radiative environment and to allow the acquisition of spatially resolved images. Inorganic scintillators cannot be used because no compromise can be found regarding the expected scintillating properties. Most of them are not fast enough and emit blue light. Organic scintillators are generally fast, but present low x-ray photoelectric absorption in the 10 to 40 keV range. This does not enable the acquisition of spatially resolved images. To this aim, we have developed highly lead-loaded and red-fluorescent fast plastic scintillators. Such a combination is not currently available via scintillator suppliers, since they propose only blue-fluorescent plastic scintillators doped with up to 12 wt% Pb. Thus, incorporation ratio up to 27 wt% Pb has been reached in our laboratory, which can afford a plastic scintillator with an outstanding Z(eff) close to 50. X-rays in the 10 to 40 keV range can thus interact with a higher probability of photoelectric effect than for classic organic scintillators, such as NE-102. The strong orange-red fluorescence can be filtered, so that we can eliminate residual Cerenkov light, generated by gamma-ray absorption in glass parts of the imaging system. Characteristic decay times of our scintillators evaluated under UV excitation were estimated to be in the range 10 to 13 ns.

Moreover, radioactive isotopes of Xe and Kr contribute significantly to the global radiological source term released in the primary coolant circuit in case of accidental situations accompanied by loss of fuel rod integrity. As a consequence, fission gas release investigation is of prime importance for the nuclear fuel cycle economy, and is the driving force for numerous R&D programs. In this domain, for understanding current fuel behavior issues, preparing the development of new fuels (e. g., for Gen IV power systems) and for improving modeling prediction capability, there is a marked need for innovations in the instrumentation field, mainly for: Quantification of very low fission gas concentrations, released from fuel sample and routed in sweeping lines, Monitoring of quick gas release variations by quantification of elementary release during a short period of time, Detection of a large range of atomic masses (e. g.,, HT, He, CO, CO2, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe), together with separation of isotopes for Xe and Kr elements, Coupled measurement of stable and radioactive gas isotopes, by using mass spectrometry and gamma spectrometry techniques in parallel. To fulfill these challenging needs, a common strategy for analysis equipment implementation has been set up thanks to a recently launched collaboration between the CEA and the University of Provence, with the support of the Liverpool University. It aims at developing a chronological series of mass spectrometer devices based upon quadrupole mass filters and 2D/3D ion traps with Fourier transform operating mode. These devices have superior performance to match the previous challenges for out-of-pile and in-pile experiments. The final objective is to install a high performance on-line mass spectrometer coupled to a gamma spectrometer in the fission product laboratory of the future Jules Horowitz Material Test Reactor. An intermediate step will consist of testing prototype equipment on an existing experimental facility in the LECA-STAR Hot Cell Laboratory of the CEA Cadarache. This paper presents the scientific and operational risks linked to fission gas issues and summarizes the current state of art for analyzing them in nuclear facilities. It details the skills gathered through this collaboration and the development approach of the mass spectrometer set-up to overcome technological problems. Finally the paper describes a proposed implementation strategy for the nuclear research facilities of CEA Cadarache.

Neutronics Experimental Validation of the Jules Horowitz Reactor Fuel by Interpretation of the VALMONT Experimental Program-Transposition of the Uncertainties on the Reactivity of JHR With JEF2.2 and JEFF3.1.1	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Advancements in Nuclear Instrumentation, Measurement Methods and their Applications	JUN 06-09, 2011	Ghent, BELGIUM			Bayesian methods; nuclear fuels; nuclear measurements; nuclear physics; uncertainty		The new European material testing Jules Horowitz Reactor (JHR), currently under construction in Cadarache center (CEA France), will use LEU (20% enrichment in U-235) fuels (U3Si2 for the start up and UMoAl in the future) which are quite different from the industrial oxide fuel, for which an extensive neutronics experimental validation database has been established. The HORUS3D/N neutronics calculation scheme, used for the design and safety studies of the JHR, is being developed within the framework of a rigorous verification-numerical validation-experimental validation methodology. In this framework, the experimental VALMONT (Validation of Aluminium Molybdenum uranium fuel for NeuTronics) program has been performed in the MINERVE facility of CEA Cadarache (France), in order to qualify the capability of HORUS3D/N to accurately calculate the reactivity of the JHR reactor. The MINERVE facility using the oscillation technique provides accurate measurements of reactivity effect of samples. The VALMONT program includes oscillations of samples of UAl infinity/Al and UMo/Al with enrichments ranging from 0.2% to 20% and Uranium densities from 2.2 to 8 g/cm(3). The geometry of the samples and the pitch of the experimental lattice ensure maximum representativeness with the neutron spectrum expected for JHR. By comparing the effect of the sample with the one of a known fuel specimen, the reactivity effect can be measured in absolute terms and be compared to computational results. Special attention was paid to the rigorous determination and reduction of the experimental uncertainties. The calculational analysis of the VALMONT results was performed with the French deterministic code APOLLO2. A comparison of the impact of the different calculation methods, data libraries and energy meshes that were tested is presented. The interpretation of the VALMONT experimental program allowed the experimental validation of JHR fuel UMoAl8 (with an enrichment of 19.75% U-235) by the Minerve-dedicated interpretation tool: PIMS. The effect of energy meshes and evaluations put forward the JEFF3.1.1/SHEM scheme that leads to a better calculation of the reactivity effect of VALMONT samples. Then, in order to quantify the impact of the uncertainties linked to the basic nuclear data, their propagation from the cross section measurement to the final computational result was analysed in a rigorous way by using a nuclear data re-estimation method based on Gauss-Newton iterations. This study concludes that the prior uncertainties due to nuclear data (uranium, aluminium, beryllium and water) on the reactivity of the Begin Of Cycle (BOC) for the JHR core reach 1217 pcm at 2 sigma and the uppermost uncertainty on the JHR reactivity is due to aluminium.
