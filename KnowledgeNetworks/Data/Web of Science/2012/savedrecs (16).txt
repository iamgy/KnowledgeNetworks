Acoustic emission on melting/solidification of natural granite simulating very deep waste disposal	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							RADIOACTIVE-WASTE; MARTENSITIC-TRANSFORMATION; QUARTZ; RECRYSTALLIZATION; TRANSITIONS	Acoustic emission (AE) signals resulting from the melting and solidification of natural granite were monitored and analysed. The experimental work was conducted in laboratory conditions simulating very deep borehole disposal (DBD) of high level wastes such as sealed radioactive sources (SRS) or spent nuclear fuel (SNF). The cumulative number of signals, their durations and frequencies were the main characteristics of the monitored processes. The recorded AE could be associated with the complex changes in volume and shape of the constituent minerals associated with solid-liquid and solid-solid phase transformations within the granite. AE from the granite was also studied in part by monitoring phase transformation on heating and cooling of quartz. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Pohl, C; Rutten, HJ				Pohl, Christoph; Ruetten, H. Jochem			Burning minor actinides in a HTR energy spectrum	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								The generation of nuclear energy by means of the existing nuclear reactor systems is based mainly on the fission of U-235. But this comes along with the capture of neutrons by the U-238 faction and results in a build-up of plutonium isotopes and minor actinides as neptunium, americium and curium. These actinides are dominant for the long time assessment of the radiological risk of a final disposal therefore a minimization of the long living isotopes is aspired. Burning the actinides in a high temperature helium cooled graphite moderated reactor (HTR) is one of these options. The use of plutonium isotopes to sustain the criticality of the system is intended to avoid on the one hand highly enriched uranium because of international regulations and on the other hand low enriched uranium because of the build up of new actinides from neutron capture in the U-238 fraction. Because initial minor actinide isotopes are typically not fissionable by thermal neutrons the idea is to fission instead the intermediate isotopes generated by the first neutron capture. This paper comprises calculations for plutonium/minor actinides/thorium fuel compositions and their correlated final burn-up for a generic pebble bed HTR based on the reference design of the 400 MW PBMR. In particular the cross sections and the neutron balance of the different minor actinide isotopes in the higher thermal energy spectrum of a HTR will be discussed. For a fuel mixture of plutonium and minor actinides a significant burn-up of these actinides up to 20% can be achieved but at the expense of a higher residual fraction of plutonium in the burned fuel. Combining thorium with a significant fraction of minor actinides and burned LWR plutonium results in a nearly unchanged amount of minor actinides while the isotope composition significantly changes. This behaviour with respect to the initial heavy metal load will also be discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Jung, HS; Choi, S; Hwang, IS; Song, MJ				Jung, Hyo Sook; Choi, Sungyeol; Hwang, Il Soon; Song, Myung-Jae			Environmental assessment of advanced partitioning, transmutation, and disposal based on long-term risk-informed regulation: PyroGreen	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Spent nuclear fuels; Geological repository assessments; Nuclear waste regulation; Partitioning and transmutation; Decontamination factors; PyroGreen	RADIOACTIVE-WASTE DISPOSAL; REPOSITORY; EXTRACTION; FISSION	The safety of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) storage has become one of the major issues of nuclear power plant operation. Direct disposal and recycling have both been criticized by the general public due to uncertainty of the long-term safety of SNF and high level waste (HLW) repositories. To meet the goal of sustainable nuclear energy, an innovative recycling approach using pyrochemical partitioning and transmutation termed PyroGreen, which is a conceptually advanced pyrochemical partitioning flowsheet, has been proposed to eliminate the need for HLW repositories. From the previous partitioning process, PyroGreen uses a combination of hull electrorefining, reductive extraction, and selective oxidation to further decontaminate SNF and HLW into low- and intermediate level waste (LILW). This paper examines the long-term environmental performance of a geological repository that houses all of the final PyroGreen-produced wastes while describing the feasibility of PyroGreen partitioning and transmutation. The final PyroGreen wastes are evaluated based on long-term risk-informed criteria: alpha-emitting isotope concentration, heat generation, and radiation dose in the surrounding biosphere. All final wastes arising from PyroGreen are to be disposed of in a geological repository at an intermediate depth, in compliance with new International Atomic Energy Agency Safety Guide for LILW. Migration assessment found that several long-lived fission products including C-14, Cl-36, Se-79, Sn-125, and I-129 dominate the long-term dose rate, whereas transuranic elements govern the risk of an inadvertent human intrusion scenario. In order to turn entire batches of SNF from 24 light water reactors with 1000 MWe with a design life of 40 years into LILW, we determined and compared the required decontamination factors of the key radionuclides for between intermediate-depth and near-surface disposal.

Time-dependent corrosion product activity in a typical PWR due to changes in coolant chemistry for long-term fuel cycles	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Computer modeling and simulation; Corrosion products; pH concentration; Enriched boric acid; Corrosion rate; Extended fuel cycle; Pressurized water reactors; Corrosion; Cooling water; Radioisotopes; Sodium; Manganese; Iron; Cobalt; Molybdenum; pH concentration; Mathematical models; Computer simulation; Corrosion products; Radionuclides	FLOW-RATE TRANSIENTS; PRESSURIZED-WATER REACTORS; NUCLEAR-REACTORS; STEEL SURFACES; SIMULATION; ACCUMULATION; PIPES	Extended fuel cycles with 18-24-month duration have complicated effects on primary coolant chemistry and finding optimum pH concentration range is difficult. For extended burnup cycles, study of changes in coolant activity due to corrosion products have been carried out for a typical pressurized water reactor (PWR) under pH and boric acid variations for linearly as well as nonlinearly accelerating corrosion rates. The computer program CPAIR-P (Deeba et al., 1999) has been modified to accommodate for time-dependent corrosion coupled with the effects of coolant chemistry. Results for Na-24, Mn-56, Fe-59, Co-60 and Mo-99 show that the specific activity in primary loop approaches equilibrium value under normal operating conditions fairly rapidly. During reactor operation, predominant corrosion product activity is due to Mn-56 and after shutdown cobalt activity dominates. These simulations suggest that the effect of increase in pH value for an extended 24-month cycle on specific activity in the form of a decrease in the activity smeared by a linearly rising corrosion. The new saturation values for activity at the end of cycle are lower (similar to 50%) than a reactor operated at constant low pH/natural boric acid in coolant. For linearly accelerated corrosion and an increase in pH value, the coolant activity shows an initial rise and then it falls to a lower saturation level at the end of cycle when pH becomes large and the activity follows the slope of corrosion rate. For nonlinear rise in corrosion rate coupled with the pH rise from 6.9 to 7.4 and use of enriched boric acid (20%-40%) results in coolant activity peak during the cycle and it also approaches much smaller saturation values at the end of cycle when compared with the activity for the system having constant low pH value (6.9) in the coolant. In this paper we show that the use of enriched boric acid as chemical shim actually lowers the primary coolant activity when higher pH values are employed in coolant rather than natural boric acid. For multiple long-term fuel cycles the corrosion product activity shows an initial rise to a maximum value and then it fall back to low saturation values due to high pH concentration for enriched boric acid (40%) as chemical shim. If the removal rates of ion-exchanger are low (epsilon(I)Q(I) similar to 100-300), then the activity builds up. However, when ion-exchanger performs well (epsilon(I)Q(I) similar to 600-900) then the overall cobalt activity remains low and saturation value does not grow much with cycles. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE IN NUCLEAR WORKERS FIRST EMPLOYED AT THE MAYAK PA IN 1948-1972	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						exposure, occupational; gamma radiation; health effects; plutonium	CHERNOBYL EMERGENCY WORKERS; ATOMIC-BOMB SURVIVORS; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASES; RADIATION-EXPOSURE; IONIZING-RADIATION; INDUSTRY WORKERS; MORTALITY; CANCER; COHORT; RISK	Following an earlier study of incidence and mortality of ischemic heart disease (IHD) published in 2010, a second analysis has been conducted based on an extended cohort and five additional years of follow-up. The cohort includes 18,763 workers, of whom 25% were females, first employed at the Mayak PA in 1948-1972 and followed up to the end of 2005. Some of these workers were exposed to external gamma rays only, and others were exposed to a mixture of external gamma-rays and internal alpha-particle radiation. A total of 6,134 cases and 2,629 deaths from IHD were identified in the study cohort. A statistically significant increasing trend was found with total external gamma-ray dose in IHD incidence (ERR/Gy 0.099; 95% CI: 0.045-0.153) after adjusting for non-radiation factors. This value reduced slightly when adjusting for internal liver dose. There was no statistically significant increase trend for internal liver dose in IHD incidence. These findings were consistent with an earlier study. New findings in IHD incidence revealed a statistically significant decrease in IHD incidence among workers exposed to external gamma-rays doses of 0.2-0.5 Gy in relation to the external doses below 0.2 Gy. This decreased risk is heavily influenced by female workers. This finding has never been reported in other studies, and the results should be treated with caution. The findings for IHD mortality are similar to those results in the earlier analysis; there was no statistically significant trend with external gamma-ray dose or for internal liver dose after adjustment for external dose. The risk estimates obtained from these analyses of IHD incidence and mortality in relation to external gamma-rays in the cohort of Mayak workers are generally compatible with those from other large occupational radiation worker studies and the Japanese atomic bomb survivors.

THYROID CANCER INCIDENCE DUE TO TECHNOGENIC EXPOSURE IN CHILDHOOD	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						analysis, risk; analysis, statistical; cancer; thyroid		Thyroid cancer incidence was studied in the cohort of residents of Ozyorsk and Kyshtym, the nearest upwind cities to the Mayak Production Association (Mayak PA), Russia's first plutonium production facility, which has been in operation since 1948. Radioactive contamination of areas around the Mayak PA were from unmonitored releases of inert gases produced by industrial reactors and also from the release of uranium fission products from a radiochemical plant stack where irradiated uranium blocks were refined. Iodine-131 (I-131) was the main contributor to the technogenic dose from atmospheric releases. Routine monitoring of gaseous releases began in the mid-1960s, when a gas purification system was perfected. Children were a critical group due to their higher radiosensitivity and specific diet (dairy products and vegetables). Both cities maintain Registries containing over 100,000 individuals born from 1934-2006. Among this group, more than 100 cases of thyroid cancer were registered during 1948-2009. The relative risk of thyroid cancer incidence is 1.5 times higher than in the Chelyabinsk.

QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF REGULATORY PROTEINS IN BLOOD AS MARKERS OF RADIATION EFFECTS IN THE LATE PERIOD AFTER OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						Pu-239; exposure, occupational; health effects; radiobiology	ATOMIC-BOMB SURVIVORS; CANCER-MORTALITY; IONIZING-RADIATION; IMMUNE-RESPONSE; NUCLEAR-PLANT; MAYAK WORKERS; LUNG-CANCER; PLUTONIUM; RISK; MICE	The objective of this research was quantitative assessment of serum and membrane regulatory proteins in blood from nuclear workers as markers of radiation-induced alterations in immune homeostasis in the late period after protracted exposure of nuclear workers with different doses. The effector and regulatory lymphocytes were measured using a flow cytofluorometer in workers from the main facilities of the Mayak PA (aged similar to 60 y up to 80 y) in the late period after combined exposure to external gamma-rays and internal alpha-radiation from incorporated Pu-239. The control group included non-occupationally exposed members of the Ozyorsk population matched by gender and age to the group of Mayak workers. Thirty serum proteins involved in regulation of immune homeostasis, such as growth factors, multifunctional interleukins, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and their receptors, were measured using ELISA in blood serum specimens from the Radiobiology Human Tissue Repository. The dosimetry estimates were obtained using Doses-2005. The correlation analysis revealed a statistically significant direct relationship of T-killers and plutonium body burden and a decreasing level of T-helpers with accumulated external dose in exposed individuals. There were differences in expression of membrane markers in young regulatory cells (double null T-lymphocytes, NKT-lymphocytes, regulatory T-cells, and an increase of activated forms of T-lymphocytes), which indicated an active role of regulatory cells in maintaining immune homeostasis in terms of protracted exposure. The assessment of regulatory proteins in blood indicated that growth factors (EGF, TGF-beta 1, PDGF), multifunctional interleukins (IL-17A, IL-18), and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta and INF-gamma) could be potential markers of radiation-induced alterations in protein status. An imbalance of pro- and antiinflammatory proteins in blood and variations of protein profiles at the lower exposure levels (gamma-ray dose <1 Gy, plutonium body burden <0.74 kBq) in the late period after protracted exposure were less pronounced than at the higher exposure levels, which was probably explained by compensatory-adaptive responses in the late period among senile individuals with polypathology.

In 2010, the concentration of Sr-90 in water of this reservoir was found to be 6.5 x 10(6) Bq L-1, the concentration of Cs-137 was 1.6 x 10(7) Bq L-1, and total alpha activity amounted to 3.0 x 10(3) Bq L-1. An increased level of nitrates was observed in the reservoir-4.4 g L-1. It has been demonstrated that in this reservoir under the conditions of the maximum contamination levels known for aquatic ecosystems in the entire biosphere, a phytoplankton community exists that has a pronounced decline in species diversity, almost to the extent of a monoculture of widely-spread thread eurytopic cyanobacteria Geitlerinema amphibium.

QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF SOURCES AND GENERAL DEPENDENCIES IN THE BEHAVIOR OF ANTHROPOGENIC RADIONUCLIDES IN THE TECHA RIVER	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						contamination, environmental; radioactivity, environmental; tritium; water, surface		Research on radioactive contamination of the environment involves the important task of assessing the contribution from different sources of contamination. If there are two or more sources of contamination with similar radionuclide composition, assessment of the contribution from each source can be challenging. Such a problem exists, for instance, in the assessment of anthropogenic sources of radioactive contamination of water in the Techa River. At the present time, the main contaminating radionuclides for the Techa River are Sr-90, Cs-137, and H-3. In 2009-2010, the content of radionuclides in the water of the river was Sr-90-3.8-32.9 Bq L-1, Cs-137-0.02-2.43 Bq L-1, and H-3-31.0-263.2 Bq L-1. This work gives a qualitative assessment of the role of different contamination sources in the formation of volumetric activity of Sr-90 in the water of the Techa River. Also, the behavior of anthropogenic radionuclides in the open fluvial river system is reviewed.

RESEARCH INTO THE FACTORS AFFECTING THE UPTAKE OF Sr-90 AND Cs-137 BY PLANTS FROM RADIOACTIVELY CONTAMINATED SOILS OF THE SOUTHERN URALS	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						Sr-90; Cs-137; contamination, environmental; soil-to-plant transfer		The objective of this work was to study the factors affecting the intake of Sr-90 and Cs-137 by plants from soils exposed to radioactive contamination resulting from operations of the Mayak Industrial Association. Specific activities of Sr-90 and Cs-137 in the samples were determined by the radiochemical method. The most severe contamination by Sr-90 and Cs-137 of natural soils was found in forest soil cover and in the 0-5 cm soil layer. The contamination density of the area is mainly determined by activity in the soil layer 0-20 cm that contains 3-97% of Sr-90 and 60-92% of Cs-137. Portions of radionuclides contained in soil (89-96% of Sr-90 and 18-73% of Cs-137) can be converted into cationic use. An insignificant share of water-soluble radionuclides goes from soil to agricultural produce.

STATUS OF ECOSYSTEMS IN RADIOACTIVE WASTE RESERVOIRS OF THE MAYAK PRODUCTION ASSOCIATION IN 2009	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						aquatic organisms; contamination, environmental; monitoring, environmental; waste disposal		Liquid radioactive waste from the Mayak Production Association (Chelyabinsk Region, Russia) is contained in industrial reservoirs (R-11, R-10, R-4, R-17, and R-9) that have different levels of radioactive contamination, increased from R-11 to R-17. A study of the ecosystems in these reservoirs was performed in 2009 to determine if there was any association with the level of contamination. No significant change in the status of biota was found in the reservoir with the lowest radionuclide concentrations (R-11) in comparison to other reservoirs in the region with a similar geography that are unaffected by radioactive contamination. In reservoir R-10, changes in the zoobenthos indices were registered. In reservoir R-4, changes in the zoobenthos and zooplankton communities were registered. In reservoir R-17, there was no ichthyofauna, but strong changes in the phytoplankton, zooplankton, and zoobenthos communities were registered. In reservoir R-9, under the conditions of the heaviest radioactive contamination of water ecosystems in the biosphere, there was no ichthyofauna, and phytoplankton and zooplankton consisted of almost a monoculture of cyanobacteriae and rotifers.

MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ANALYSIS OF BIOASSAY DATA FROM LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP OF TWO REFRACTORY PUO2 INHALATION CASES	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						analysis, statistical; bioassay; intake, radionuclide; lungs, human	RETENTION	The U.S. Transuranium and Uranium Registries' tissue donors 0202 and 0407 are the two most highly exposed of the 18 registrants who were involved in the 1965 plutonium fire accident at a defense nuclear facility. Material released during the fire was well characterized as "high fired'' refractory plutonium dioxide with 0.32-mu m mass median diameter. The extensive bioassay data from long-term follow-up of these two cases were used to evaluate the applicability of the Human Respiratory Tract Model presented by International Commission on Radiological Protection in Publication 66 and its revision proposed by Gregoratto et al. in order to account for the observed long-term retention of insoluble material in the lungs. The maximum likelihood method was used to calculate the point estimates of intake and tissue doses and to examine the effect of different lung clearance, blood absorption, and systemic models on the goodness-of-fit and estimated dose values. With appropriate adjustments, Gregoratto et al. particle transport model coupled with the customized blood absorption parameters yielded a credible fit to the bioassay data for both cases and predicted the Case 0202 liver and skeletal activities measured postmortem. PuO2 particles produced by the plutonium fire are extremely insoluble. About 1% of this material is absorbed from the respiratory tract relatively rapidly, at a rate of about 1 to 2 d(-1) (half-time about 8 to 16 h). The remainder (99%) is absorbed extremely slowly, at a rate of about 5 x 10(-6) d(-1) (half-time about 400 y). When considering this situation, it appears that doses to other body organs are negligible in comparison to those to tissues of the respiratory tract. About 96% of the total committed weighted dose equivalent is contributed by the lungs. Doses absorbed by these workers' lungs were high: 3.2 Gy to AI and 6.5 Gy to LNTH for Case 0202 (18 y post-intake) and 3.2 Gy to AI and 55.5 Gy to LNTH for Case 0407 (43 y post-intake). This evaluation supports the Gregoratto et al. proposed revision to the ICRP 66 model when considering situations of extremely insoluble particles.

RadBall (R) is a novel, passive, radiation detection device that provides a 3-D visualization of radiation from areas where measurements have not been previously possible due to lack of access or extremely high radiation doses. This technology has been under development during recent years, and all of its previous tests have included dry deployments. This study involved, for the first time, underwater RadBall (R) deployments in hot cells containing (CsCl)-Cs-137 capsules at the U.S. Department of Energy's Hanford Site. RadBall (R) can be used to characterize a contaminated room, hot cell, or glovebox by providing the locations of the radiation sources and hazards, identifying the radionuclides present within the cell, and determining the radiation sources' strength (e. g., intensities or dose rates). These parameters have been previously determined for dry deployments; however, only the location of radiation sources and hazards can be determined for an underwater RadBall (R) deployment. The results from this study include 3-D images representing the location of the radiation sources within the Hanford Site cells. Due to RadBall (R)'s unique deployability and non-electrical nature, this technology shows significant promise for future characterization of radiation hazards prior to and during the decommissioning of contaminated nuclear facilities.

Thermal-hydraulic modeling of reactivity insertion in a research reactor	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Thermal-hydraulics; Research reactor; Reactivity insertion	KINETICS	Transient reactivity insertion for a pool type research reactor with scram enabled is numerically investigated. The analyses were performed by developing a coupled kinetic-thermal-hydraulics code, with continuous feedback due to coolant and fuel temperature effects. A modified Runge-Kutta method was adopted for a better solution to a system of stiff point kinetic equations. Transient thermal-hydraulics during the process of slow and fast reactivity insertion were considered for a IAEA 10-MW research reactor. The code was used to carry out transient thermal-hydraulics analysis for both high-enriched uranium (HEU) and low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel. Reactor power, fuel, clad and coolant temperatures, MDNBR, reactor period, energy released for slow and fast reactivity insertion transients were predicted. The model prediction was verified through comparison with the PARET code and other institution results reported in the literature for detailed simulations of reactivity insertion. The comparison of simulation results and the PARET code showed good agreement for the main thermal-hydraulic parameters. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The objective of the proposed work was focused to apply ANN to identify isotopes and to predict uncertainties of their activities of some natural radioactive sources. The method was tested for analyzing gamma-ray spectra emitted from natural radionuclides in soil samples detected by a high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometry based on HPGe (high purity germanium).

U-238, Th-232 content and radon exhalation rate in some Egyptian building materials	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						U-238; Th-232; Radon exhalation rate; Building materials; ICP-MS and SSNTD	NUCLEAR TRACK DETECTORS; NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; SOIL SAMPLES; RADIATION; URANIUM; THORIUM; INDIA; DWELLINGS; SSNTDS; CR-39	In controlling natural radiation exposure for the residents of dwellings, it is necessary to determine the levels of natural radioactivity (external exposure) and radon exhalation rate (internal exposure) from building materials. In this paper uranium (U-238) and thorium (Th-232) content were measured in different building material samples using two different techniques: first, using Jeol high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer HR-ICP-MS (plasmax2); and, secondly, using solid state nuclear track detectors SSNTDs. There was a good agreement between the measurements of uranium and thorium with both methods. Exhalation rate and emanation coefficient of radon in several building material samples were determined using LR-115 polymeric nuclear track detectors. Radon exhalation rate varied from; 11.83 mBq m(-2) h(-1) in Red Clay Brick to 36.86 mBq m(-2) h(-1) in Granite. A series of equations were used to estimate indoor radon exposure and annual effective doses in some models typical room of Egyptian house. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Moharram, B.

Performance of novel silicon n-in-p planar pixel sensors	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Pixel detector; n-in-p silicon sensors; ATLAS; High luminosity-LHC; Radiation hardness		The performance of novel n-in-p planar pixel detectors designed for future upgrades of the ATLAS Pixel system is presented. The n-in-p silicon sensors technology is a promising candidate for the pixel upgrade thanks to its radiation hardness and cost effectiveness that allow for enlarging the area instrumented with pixel detectors. The n-in-p modules presented here are composed of pixel sensors produced by CiS connected by bump-bonding to the ATLAS read-out chip FE-I3. The characterization of these devices has been performed before and after irradiation up to a fluence of 5 x 10(15) 1 MeV n(eq)cm(-2). Charge collection measurements carried out with radioactive sources have proven the functioning of this technology up to these particle fluences. First results from beam test data with a 120 GeV/c pion beam at the CERN-SPS are also discussed, demonstrating a high tracking efficiency of (98.6 +/- 0.3)% and a high collected charge of about 10 ke for a device irradiated at the maximum fluence and biased at 1 kV.

The Orsay Universal Plunger System	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						In-beam gamma-ray spectroscopy; Recoil-Distance Doppler Shift; Lifetimes	KR-76; NUCLEI	A new plunger device for Recoil-Distance Doppler Shift and Time-Differential Recoil-In-Vacuum measurements has been developed at the CSNSM in collaboration with the IPN Orsay. It is conceived to be easily adapted to different experimental setups and facilities, in particular to the future radioactive beam facility Spiral2. An electronic feedback system keeping the distance between target and stopper foils constant, imperative for precision measurements of short lifetimes, was also developed. The plunger device was commissioned with an experiment performed at the IPN Orsay Tandem accelerator laboratory using the Orgam germanium detector array. Excited states in Kr-76 were populated using the reaction Sc-45(Cl-35,2p2n)Kr-76. The lifetime tau of the 4(1)(+) state was determined to 4.3(6) ps, in accordance with previous measurement, confirming the functionality of the new plunger device. The commissioning experiment showed in particular that the electronic feed back system works as foreseen. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Design of an 18 MW vortex flow water beam dump for 500 GeV electrons/positrons of an international linear collider	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Beam Dump; International Linear Collider; 500 GeV electron/positron; 18 MW beam power; Thermal design; CFD analysis; Radioactivity; Window cooling; Primary coolant circuit; Pressure waves		Beam dumps are essential components of any accelerator system. They are usually located at the end of the beam delivery systems and are designed to safely absorb and dissipate the particle energy. In the second stage of the proposed International Linear Collider (ILC), the electron and positron beams are accelerated to 500 GeV each (1 TeV total). Each bunch will have 2 x 10(10) electrons/positrons, and 2820 bunches form one beam bunch train with time duration of 0.95 ms and 4 Hz frequency. The average beam power will be 18 MW with a peak power of 4.5 GW. The FLUKA code was used to determine the power deposited by the beam at all critical locations. This data forms the input into the thermal hydraulic analysis CFD code for detailed flow and thermal evaluation. Both 2D and 3D flow analyses were carried out at all the critical regions to arrive at optimum geometry and flow parameters of the beam dump. The generation and propagation of pressure waves due to rapid deposition of heat has also been analyzed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Registration of proton induced spallation products of U, Pb and Au in mica track detectors	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Fission residues; Spallation residues; Evaporation residues; Mica track detectors	FISSION NEUTRON FIELD; REACTION U-238+P; CROSS-SECTIONS; RECOIL PROPERTIES; MONTE-CARLO; RESIDUES; CALIBRATION; SYSTEMATICS; COLLISIONS; URANIUM	Detection of fission and spallation-evaporation residues resulting from interaction of relativistic protons with uranium, lead and gold targets in mica track detectors is investigated by the Monte Carlo method and using experimental data available in literature. It is shown that the contribution of spallation-evaporation residues to total track density is strongly dependent on target thickness and is the least for thick targets. This contribution in the case of thick target materials with Z >= 79 is less than or is within the statistical uncertainty of a typical track density measurement. Although our results on registration and detection of the spallation residues in mica are based on the interactions of uranium and lead with protons at 1A GeV and gold with protons at 0.8A GeV, they are applicable to all targets with Z >= 79 and for proton energies much higher than 1 GeV.

First demonstration of a Compton gamma imager based on silicon photomultipliers	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						SiPM; Silicon photomultiplier; Compton; Gamma; Imager	CAMERA; DETECTOR	We are developing a rugged and person-transportable Compton gamma imager for use in security investigations of radioactive materials, and for radiological incident remediation. The imager is composed of layers of scintillator with light collection for the forward layers provided by silicon photomultipliers and for the rear layer by photomultiplier tubes. As a first step, we have developed a 1/5th-scale demonstration unit of the final imager. We present the imaging performance of this demonstration unit for Cs-137 at angles of up to 30 degrees off-axis. Results are also presented for Sn-113 and Na-22. This represents the first demonstration of the use of silicon photomultipliers as an embedded component for light collection in a Compton gamma imager.

It consists of two complementary measurement positions. The position sensitive alpha-gamma coincidence setup of PANDA has been updated with a pile-up rejection circuit. This article demonstrates, using a Am-241 source, that this circuit can be used to identify gamma-ray sum peaks in the spectra. The second measurement position reported here hosts a 10-mm(2) windowless silicon drift detector that detects electrons and X-rays with a very good energy resolution. An experimental value of 0.30 keV for full width at half maximum was obtained at 17.7 keV energy (Np X-rays). Conversion electron spectrometry, for example, provides an independent, complementary means to study actinides whose low energy transitions are often highly converted. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Wittmaack, K; Mutzke, A				Wittmaack, Klaus; Mutzke, Andreas			Depth of origin of sputtered atoms: Exploring the dependence on relevant target properties to identify the correlation with low-energy ranges	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Sputtering; Depth of origin; Surface binding energy; Density effect; Projected range	COMPUTER-SIMULATION; PROGRAM; TRIM.SP; TRIDYN; YIELD	The correlation of the depth of origin (DoO) of sputtered atoms with relevant properties of the bombarded target has not yet been clarified in a satisfactory manner. We have carried out SDTrimSP (Monte Carlo) simulations to study the dependence of depth differential sputtering yields on the following parameters: the position of the primary knock-on atom, the surface binding energy, E-s, the target density, N, and the target atomic number, Z(2). All calculations were performed with normally incident projectiles, either Xe or target-atom-like, with energies between 40 and 10 keV. The mean DoO, < x >, was found to depend on E-s as < x > proportional to E-s(p), with a power p between 0.10 (0.1 keV) and 0.26 (10 keV Xe). In prior work, lack of knowledge of this weak E-s-dependence did not allow the relation between < x > and N to be uncovered properly. To proceed further, differential yields were calculated for targets ranging from carbon to uranium with deliberately varied N, but keeping E-s fixed (4.72 eV). The product < x > N turned out to depend very little on N. Hence, it is appropriate to specify the origin of sputtered atoms in terms of the equivalent areal density rather than in units of depth. For medium-mass or heavy target atoms, i.e., for Z(2) > 20, < x > N was largely independent of Z(2). For Z(2) < 20, < x > N increased with decreasing Z(2). Projected ranges x(p) calculated for target-atom-like projectiles at energies <= 40 eV exhibited almost the same Z(2)-dependence as < x >. This finding suggests that < x > is determined by the range of the recoils mobilized in the collision cascade. The results of this study are compared with previously published data, with sometimes distinctly different definitions of < x >. The idea is recapitulated that the most appropriate way of quantifying the DoO is to quote the fraction of atoms ejected from the top (or outermost) layer of atoms. The fractions determined by SDTrimSP range from about 98% to 75%, for impact energies between 40 eV and 10 keV and Z(2) > 20. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Hereby, the design of impact limiters and foundation properties of the handling region have a major effect on the mechanical loading of the cask and lid system. Reliable numerical simulations, which very often constitute a relevant part of such safety proofs, require systematic information about the energy absorption potential of the respective materials and its implementation in FEM (finite element) programs. However, when performing drop tests, BAM (BAM Bundesanstalt fur Materialforschung und -prufung, Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing) identified significant differences between numerical and experimental results, which most likely result from numerical methods that do not sufficiently reproduce the behaviour of impact limiting structures. Particularly concerned are container impact limiter made of wood or polyurethane foam as well as damping concrete bricks, which are embedded in foundations of German interim storages. Hence, at the end of 2008 BAM initiated the research project ENREA (development of numerical methods for analyzing impact limiters subjected to impact or drop scenarios) funded by BMBF. It aims to develop appropriate materials models for simulating impact limiters based on a comprehensive experimental program. Latter consists of static and dynamic compression tests on wood, foam and damping concrete, where test parameters include temperature, support conditions and the material orientation. This contribution focus on results from the first project stage, which comprises displacement-driven tests at constant loading rates varying between 0.02 mm/s and 3,000 mm/s. The data are used to adopt materials models by stepwise optimizing the applicable parameters of FE calculations. The underlying concepts as well as the limitations of available models are presented. Not included is the outcome for wood due to the huge test volume and complexity of applicable numerical techniques. These results are rather given in an independent paper at KONTEC 2011.

J	Tromm, W				Tromm, Walter			Nuclear Safety Research in HGF 2011	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								After the events at the Japanese nuclear power plant of Fukushima Daiichi, the German federal government decided that Germany will give up electricity generation from nuclear power within a decade. The last reactor will be disconnected from the power grid in 2022. Helping to make this opt-out as safe as possible is one of the duties of the Helmholtz Association with its Nuclear Safety Research Program within the Energy Research Area. Also the demolition of nuclear power plants and the repository problem will keep society, and thus also research, busy for a number of decades to come. Giving up electricity production from nuclear power thus must not mean giving up the required nuclear technology competences. In the fields of reactor safety, demolition, final storage, radiation protection, and crisis management, in critical support of international developments, and for competent evaluation of nuclear facilities around Germany, these competences will be in demand far beyond the German opt-out. This is the reason why the final report by the Ethics Committee on "Safe Energy Supply" emphasizes the importance of nuclear technology research. Close cooperation on national, European and international levels is indispensable in this effort. Also nuclear safety research in the Helmholtz Association is aligned with the challenges posed by the opt-out of the use of nuclear power. It is important that the high competences in the areas of plant safety and demolition, handling of radioactive waste, and safe final storage as well as radiation protection be preserved. The Nuclear Safety Research Program within the Energy Research Area of the Helmholtz Association therefore will continue studying scientific and technical aspects of the safety of nuclear reactors and the safety of nuclear waste management. These research activities are provident research conducted for society and must be preserved for a long period of time. The work is closely harmonized with the activities of the partners in the Nuclear Competence Association. As of January 2011, the Dresden-Rossendorf Helmholtz Center (HZDR), with its 2 Institutes of Safety Research and for Radiochemistry, is an integral part of the Nuclear Safety Research Program within the Energy Research Area. Both institutes work on topics of safety research for nuclear reactors and safety research for nuclear waste management. In this way, the 2 institutes represent very welcome added value as well as a supplement to the Nuclear Safety Research Program.

Systematic grid-wise radon concentration measurements and first radon map in Cyprus	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article						Radon concentration; Radioactivity; Effective dose rate; Portable active radon detectors; Grid-wise radon map; ArcMap; Cyprus	GAMMA-RADIATION MEASUREMENTS; RN-222 CONCENTRATION; SURFACE SOILS; DOSE-RATES; INDOOR; ROCKS	A systematic study of the indoor airborne radon concentration in the central part of the Nicosia district was conducted, using high-sensitivity active radon portable detectors of the type "RADIM3A". From a total of 108 measurements in 54 grids of 1 km(2) area each, the overall mean value is 20.6 +/- 13.2 Bq m(-3) (A.M. +/- S.D.). That is almost twice less than the corresponding average worldwide value. The radon concentration levels in drinking water were also measured in 24 sites of the residential district, using the high-sensitivity radon detector of the type "RADIM3W". The mean value obtained from these measurements is 243.8 +/- 224.8 mBq l(-1), which is relatively low compared to the corresponding internationally accepted level. The associated annual effective dose rates to each measurement were also calculated and compared to the corresponding worldwide values. From the geographical coordinates of the measuring sites and the corresponding radon concentration values, the digital radon map of the central part of the Nicosia district was constructed for the first time, by means of the ArcMap software package.

J	Gellermann, R				Gellermann, R.			The world we really live in - communication on radiation	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article								In order to make the communication on radiation and radiation levels more tangible and clear to the general public, measured results from actual living environments are needed. The paper demonstrates by means of measured results of the ambient dose rates (ODL) that the ambient dose rates in the centre of German cities locally exceed levels typical for the respective geogenic environment significantly. The highest dose rates which have been measured up to now reach 680 nSv/h. The role of these results from the radiation protection point of view is discussed and a level of 300 nSv/h is suggested as an upper level of the normal ambient dose rate in the urban environment. Still higher dose rates have been found in areas with radioactively contaminated soil. The need for remediation of such contaminated sites is indicated.

Determination of the nuclide vector for decommissioning projects at PSI (Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland)	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article								In the context of two reactor decommissioning projects, radioactive slurry from concrete cutting was collected in the retention pond (RHB) at the Paul Scherrer Institute, along with radioactive drain outlets. Additionally, there are active residues from former operations. The task was to determine the nuclide vector of the radioactive slurry before final disposal. Due to the slurry from neutron-activated concrete, activation products, like Fe-55, Co-60, Ni-63, Ba-133, Eu-152, Eu-154 and Eu-155 can be expected. Accumulated drain outlets from laboratories, where work with radioactive substances is being done, were expected to contain Na-22, Co-60, Cs-134, Cs-137, Ba-133, Eu-152, Eu-154, Eu-155, Am-241, Pu-239/240, Pu-241, Cm-244, U-234, U-235, U-238, Th-230, Th-232 and Sr-90. For further clarification, H-3 and C-14 in the water and in the organic phase had to be measured as well. This work gives an overview about the slurry dissolution techniques, the radiochemical separation methods and activity concentrations of the nuclide vector. Further processing of the slurry is also discussed.

Application of the tracer gas technology to investigate convective radon transport processes between mine workings and houses	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article								In areas featuring air-filled mine workings the convective radon transport through the disturbed bedrock is a frequent cause of high radon concentrations in dwellings. The vertical transport distance of the radon propagation can be more than one hundred meters. The application of tracer gases that can be detected by gas chromatography at extreme low concentrations allows the clear detection of mine-originated radon in dwellings and provides knowledge on the complex processes of radon transport. The successful application of the method is demonstrated on the basis of investigations of the impact of former uranium mine sites on the radon situation in dwellings.

The application of equilibrium models to incidence situations using the example of the exposure pathway human milk	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article								The radiation exposure after a short-term release of radioactive substances is often calculated assuming equilibrium conditions. An example is that of the German Incident Calculation Bases for nuclear power plants with pressurized water reactors. Here, the contamination of human milk is calculated using transfer factors. Applying this equilibrium model to incident situations raises the question whether baby's radiation exposure is adequately assessed. This contribution shows that compliance with the relevant dose limits of paragraph 49 of the German Radiation Protection Ordinance is ensured for design basis accidents on the assumption that the hypothetical breastfeeding period starts at the beginning of the activity release. Comparative analyses were performed against the biokinetic models applied by ICRP for radiation protection purposes, taking the reference nuclides Cs-137, Sr-90, I-131, Am-241 and long-lived plutonium isotopes as examples.

This framework can cover the internal PSA model and external PSA models (fire, flooding, and seismic PSA models) in the full power and the low power-shutdown modes. This framework also integrates level 1, 2 and 3 PSA to quantify the risk of nuclear facilities more efficiently and consistently. We expect that this framework will be helpful to resolve the issue regarding the limited scope of PSA and to reduce some inconsistencies that might exist between (1) the internal and external PSA, and (2) full power mode PSA and low power-shutdown PSA models. In addition, KAERI is starting researches related to the extreme external events, the risk assessment of spent fuel pool, and the site risk. These emerging issues will be incorporated into the integrated risk assessment framework. In this paper the integrated risk assessment framework and the research activities on the emerging issues are outlined.

Even though pyroprocess waste amounts can be smaller than that of PWR spent fuel assembly in case of direct disposal, this process essentially will produce various and unique radioactive wastes. The goals of this article are to characterize these wastes, calculate the amount of wastes, design disposal systems for each waste and evaluate the radiation safety of each system by dose assessment. The absorbed dose results of the metal and ceramic waste for the engineering barrier system (EBS) showed 2.21 x 10(-2) Gy/h and 1.15 x 10(-2) Gy/h, which are lower than the recommended value of 1 Gy/h.

The 3-way PLS2 prediction results were compared with 2-way PLS2 and it was shown that 3-way PLS2 results are more accurate than the results of PLS2. Thermal ionization-mass spectrometry was used as a reference method for calculating the accuracy of our method.

In the present study, the bark of oak trees (Quercus petraea Liebl.) was collected from Belgrade Forest northwest of Istanbul for determination of Cs-137, K-40, Th-232, and U-238 activity. A gamma spectrometer equipped with high-purity germanium detector was used for radioactivity measurement. Bark samples were collected from the northern and southern sides of trees at a height of 1.5 m above the ground in order to see the effects of rainfall and wind; and they were also collected from the northern side at a height of 0.5 m above the ground to assess the effect of soil splash. The activity concentrations of Cs-137, K-40, Th-232, and U-238 in the bark samples were found to vary in the range of 1.40-27.50, 45.0-221.2, 0.92-9.64, and 4.04-36.10 Bq/kg, respectively. The elevated activity of U-238 in bark samples could be attributed to a large amount of coal combustion in the region until the 1990s. According to one-way ANOVA, a significant difference was not found in bark samples collected at a height of 0.5 m and 1.5 m above the ground in terms of radionuclide activity. There was also no significant variation regarding radionuclide accumulation between northern and southern sides.

Today, anti CD-20 antibodies labeled with beta emitter radionuclides are used in radio immunotherapy. Various radionuclides for labeling anti CD-20 antibodies have been studied and developed for the treatment and diagnosis of malignancies. This paper describes the preparation, bio-distribution and absorbed dose rate of In-111, Y-90, Lu-177, and Sm-133 labeled anti CD-20 antibodies (rituximab) in human organs, after injection to rats. The macro cyclic bifunctional chelating agent, N-succinimidyl-1, 4, 7, 10-tetraazacyclododecane-1, 4, 7, 10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA-NHS) for conjugation to antibody, was used to prepare DOTA-rituximab. The conjugates were purified by molecular filtration, the average number of DOTA conjugated per mAb was calculated and total concentration was determined by spectrophotometric method. Radio-labeling was performed at 40 degrees C for 24 hours. After the quality control studies, the final radioactive solution was injected intravenously into rats through their tail vein. The tissue uptakes of each injection were measured. Then we calculated S values for Lu-177 and Sm-153 by using specific absorbed fractions and data used in the manner of radio-labeled analysis and dosimetry for humans. The absorbed dose rate of each organ was calculated in the specific time by medical internal radiation dose method with linear approximation in the activity measurements.

One of the most important of these features is the alpha-activity which is due to actinides (U-235, U-238, Pu-239, etc.) If non-destructive passive methods are not sufficient to quantify the latter, non-destructive active methods based on the fission process represent a solution of interest. First, these methods consist in irradiating a package in order to induce fission reactions on the actinides, and then, to detect the prompt and delayed particles which are emitted following these reactions. Our aim is to conduct neutron interrogation measurements on nuclear waste packages using an electron accelerator as a photoneutron generator. One of the main interests of this approach is that the intensity of the neutron flux can be one or two orders of magnitude higher than the one delivered by a deuterium-tritium generator. With the objective of improving nuclear waste characterization, the development of this method could enable the integration of three complementary techniques on a single measurement cell (active neutron interrogation, active photon interrogation, and high-energy imaging). In this paper, simulation and experimental results are presented. A simulation study using MCNPX has been conducted in order to determine the characteristics of the photoneutron flux emitted by the electron accelerator of the SAPHIR facility owned by CEA LIST. Energy spectra, angular distribution and intensity of the photoneutron flux have been obtained. A photoneutron interrogation measurement cell based on this accelerator has been built and assessed by carrying out measurements on uranium samples. Delayed gamma-ray spectra have been acquired and enabled to confirm the experimental feasibility of our method.

J	Wunderlich, A; Noo, F				Wunderlich, Adam; Noo, Frederic			On Efficient Assessment of Image-Quality Metrics Based on Linear Model Observers	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						AUC; image quality; model observer; receiver operating characteristic (ROC); signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)	CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; NOISE PROPERTIES; EM ALGORITHM; PERFORMANCE; VARIANCE; CURVES	This paper is motivated by the problem of image-quality assessment using model observers for the purpose of development and optimization of medical imaging systems. Specifically, we present a study regarding the estimation of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the observer and associated summary measures. This study evaluates the statistical advantage that may be gained in ROC estimates of observer performance by assuming that the difference of the class means for the observer ratings is known. Such knowledge is frequently available in image-quality studies employing known-location lesion detection tasks together with linear model observers. The study is carried out by introducing parametric point and confidence interval estimators that incorporate a known difference of class means. An evaluation of the new estimators for the area under the ROC curve establishes that a large reduction in statistical variability can be achieved through incorporation of knowledge of the difference of class means. Namely, the mean 95% AUC confidence interval length can be as much as seven times smaller in some cases.

Locating, quantifying and characterising radiation hazards in contaminated nuclear facilities using a novel passive non-electrical polymer based radiation imaging device	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article							3D DOSIMETRY SYSTEM; DETECTOR	This paper provides a summary of recent trials which took place at the US Department of Energy Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) during December 2010. The overall objective for the trials was to demonstrate that a newly developed technology could be used to locate, quantify and characterise the radiological hazards within two separate ORNL hot cells (B and C). The technology used, known as RadBall (R), is a novel, passive, non-electrical polymer based radiation detection device which provides a 3D visualisation of radiation from areas where effective measurements have not been previously possible due to lack of access. This is particularly useful in the nuclear industry prior to the decommissioning of facilities where the quantity, location and type of contamination are often unknown. For hot cell B, the primary objective of demonstrating that the technology could be used to locate, quantify and characterise three radiological sources was met with 100% success. Despite more challenging conditions in hot cell C, two sources were detected and accurately located. To summarise, the technology performed extremely well with regards to detecting and locating radiation sources and, despite the challenging conditions, moderately well when assessing the relative energy and intensity of those sources. Due to the technology's unique deployability, non-electrical nature and its directional awareness the technology shows significant promise for the future characterisation of radiation hazards prior to and during the decommissioning of contaminated nuclear facilities.

Tritium release during nuclear power operation in China	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article								Overviews were evaluated of tritium releases and related doses to the public from airborne and liquid effluents from nuclear power plants on the mainland of China before 2009. The differences between tritium releases from various nuclear power plants were also evaluated. The tritium releases are mainly from liquid pathways for pressurised water reactors, but tritium releases between airborne and liquid effluents are comparable for heavy water reactors. The airborne release from a heavy water reactor is obviously higher than that from a pressurised water reactor.	[Yang, D. J.; Chen, X.

J	Thorne, MC				Thorne, M. C.			Is Yucca Mountain a long-term solution for disposing of US spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste?	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article								On 26 January 2012, the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future released a report addressing, amongst other matters, options for the managing and disposal of high-level waste and spent fuel. The Blue Ribbon Commission was not chartered as a siting commission. Accordingly, it did not evaluate Yucca Mountain or any other location as a potential site for the storage or disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste. Nevertheless, if the Commission's recommendations are followed, it is clear that any future proposals to develop a repository at Yucca Mountain would require an extended period of consultation with local communities, tribes and the State of Nevada. Furthermore, there would be a need to develop generally applicable regulations for disposal of spent fuel and high-level radioactive waste, so that the Yucca Mountain site could be properly compared with alternative sites that would be expected to be identified in the initial phase of the site-selection process. Based on what is now known of the conditions existing at Yucca Mountain and the large number of safety, environmental and legal issues that have been raised in relation to the DOE Licence Application, it is suggested that it would be imprudent to include Yucca Mountain in a list of candidate sites for future evaluation in a consent-based process for site selection. Even if there were a desire at the local, tribal and state levels to act as hosts for such a repository, there would be enormous difficulties in attempting to develop an adequate post-closure safety case for such a facility, and in showing why this unsaturated environment should be preferred over other geological contexts that exist in the USA and that are more akin to those being studied and developed in other countries.

The new systems are using expanded polytetrafluroethane (ePTFE) membrane or polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers as the solid support. The systems are compared in two ways. First in how much Aliquat-336 they contain with the Vs, ratio of volume of Aliquat-336 to volume of polymeric support, being 0.158, 0.483, and 0.590 for the TEVA (R) resin, PAN fibers, and the ePTFE systems, respectively. The second comparison is in their performance capacity of extraction of uranyl chloride anion complex. The fiber and resins systems show similar capacities, and the membrane system being an order of magnitude less than the other systems. A cost comparison demonstrates the savings advantages of using a fiber based support compared with resin and membrane support systems.

The analysis of the composition of surface was other aim of study. Discs were measured by alpha spectrometer. After that, alpha spectrometry discs were analyzed by TOF-SIMS IV, which is installed in the International Laser Centre in Bratislava. The integral and normalized intensities of isotope of Th-232 and intensities of ions of ThO+, ThOH+, ThO2H+, Th2O4H+, ThO2-, ThO3H-, ThH3O3- a ThN2O5H- were measured. The linear correlation is between surface's weights of Th and intensities of ions of Th+ from identified in SIMS spectra. We found out the chemical binding between thorium and oxygen and hydrogen on the surface of samples by SIMS method. Obtained intensities of ions (ThO+)-Th-232, (ThOH+)-Th-232, (ThO2H+)-Th-232 prove the presence of oxidized forms of thorium in the upper layers of surface. The oxidized ions predominate in univalent form of thorium up to deep about 3,000 nm.

X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopic study of uranium nitrides	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						EXAFS; Uranium; Nitrides; Nuclear fuel		Uranium mononitride (UN), sesquinitride (U2N3) and dinitride (UN2) were characterized by extended X-Ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. Analysis on UN indicate the presence of three uranium shells at distances of 3.46(3), 4.89(5) and 6.01(6) angstrom and a nitrogen shell at a distance of 2.46(2) angstrom. For U2N3, two absorbing uranium atoms at different crystallographic positions are present in the structure. One of the uranium atoms is surrounded by nitrogen atoms at 2.28(2) angstrom and by uranium atoms at 3.66(4) and 3.95(4) angstrom. The second type of uranium atom is surrounded by nitrogen atoms at 2.33(2) and 2.64(3) angstrom and by uranium atoms at 3.66(4), 3.95(4) and 5.31(5) angstrom. Results on UN2 indicate two uranium shells at 3.71(4) and 5.32(5) angstrom and two nitrogen shells at 2.28(2) and 4.34(4) angstrom. The lattice parameters of UN, U2N3 and UN2 unit cells were respectively determined to be 4.89(5), 10.62(10) and 5.32(5) angstrom. Those results are well in agreement with those obtained by X-Ray diffraction analysis.

Constrains in gamma spectrometry analysis of fallout Cs-137 in coastal marine environment of Arabian sea in India	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Gamma-ray spectrometry; Cs-137 activity; Arabian sea	RADIOACTIVITY; WATER	In this study, an accurate faster gamma spectrometry method for measuring the low level activity concentrations of Cs-137 using in situ pre-concentration technique on copper ferrocyanide cartridge was standardized. Due to unavailability of reference standard in the copper ferrocyanide matrix, efficiency calibration curves were plotted using RGU and RGTh reference standards. To harmonize the difference in density of standard and sample the required density correction factors for photo peak efficiency were generated. The in situ pre-concentration technique followed by gamma-ray spectrometry was applied for activity determination in surface seawater from eight locations in the coastal marine environment of Arabian Sea. The mean activity concentration of Cs-137 ranged between 0.71 and 0.91 Bq/m(3). Higher activity concentrations were observed at location with latitude, longitude of 21.6 degrees N, 69.57 degrees E as compared to concentration observed at location with latitude, longitude 16.98 degrees N, 73.25 degrees E. The observed concentrations were found to be in range of data reported in Asia-Pacific Marine radioactive database (ASPARMARD). The results will fill up the gaps in the existing database. The generated data will be useful for monitoring fresh input of anthropogenic radionuclide into coastal marine environment for post Fukushima environmental assessment.	[Sartandel, S. J.; Jha, S.

Investigation of radioactivity level in soil and drinking water samples collected from the city of Erzincan, Turkey	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Soil; Water; Radioactivity; Erzincan; Turkey; Dose	ENVIRONMENTAL-RADIOACTIVITY; DOSE ASSESSMENT; REGION; RATES	This study is part of an effort to assess the level of background radiation for Erzincan Province of eastern Turkey. Radionuclide activity concentrations in soil samples were measured through gamma-ray spectrometry and the average activities were determined as 8.93, 11.39, 281.94, and 9.52 Bq/kg for the radionuclides U-238, Th-232, K-40(,) and Cs-137, respectively. The average annual effective dose from these natural radioactivity sources (U-238 series, Th-232 series and K-40,) was calculated to be 27.9 mu Sv. Radioactivity levels in drinking and potable water samples were studied using a multi-channel low level proportional counter. The average gross alpha activity concentration was found to be 0.0477 Bq/L (min. 0.007 Bq/L; max. 0.421 Bq/L) and the average gross beta activity was measured as 0.104 Bq/L (min. 0.008 Bq/L; max. 1.806 Bq/L). These values lead to an average annual effective dose of 9.75 mu Sv from the alpha emitters and 56.34 mu Sv from the beta emitting radionuclides in water. The radioactivity levels in the water samples investigated were found to comply with the reference levels recommended by WHO and the regulations set forth by the Turkish Health Ministry.

Biosorption of uranium(VI) by a mangrove endophytic fungus Fusarium sp. #ZZF51 from the South China Sea	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Mangrove endophytic fungus; Fusarium sp #ZZF51; Uranium(VI) ion; Biosorption	AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; HEAVY-METALS; REMOVAL; RECOVERY; MICROORGANISMS; WATER	The uranium(VI) accumulation was studied in detail by using the biomass of mangrove endophytic fungus Fusarium sp.#ZZF51 from the South China Sea. The uranium(VI) biosorption process onto the tested fungus powders was optimized at pH 4.0, adsorption time 60 min, and uranium(VI) initial concentration 50 mg L-1 with 61.89% of removal efficiency. According to Fourier transform infrared spectra for the tested fungus before and after loaded with uranium(VI), the results showed that both of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups acted as the important roles in the adsorption process. In addition, the experimental data were analyzed by using parameter and kinetic models, and it was obtained that the Langmuir isotherm model and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model provided better correlation with the experimental data for adsorption of uranium(VI).

Purification of americium from assorted analytical waste in hydrochloric acid medium	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Americium; TODGA; DHOA; CMPO; MDBTDMA; TRPO; Analytical waste	SEQUENTIAL ISOTOPIC DETERMINATION; BIOASSAY SAMPLES; PLUTONIUM; AM-241; SOIL; RADIONUCLIDES; EXTRACTANTS; STRONTIUM; THORIUM; URANIUM	During the simultaneous extraction of plutonium and uraniumusing anion exchange chromatographic technique from analytical waste in hydrochloric acid medium, Am-241 which is invariably present in the plutonium bearing fuel samples remains in the effluent. A two step separation scheme was developed for the recovery and purification of Am from the assorted waste to facilitate the disposal of large volume of aqueous waste and the purified Am solution was utilized for spectroscopic investigation. The separation scheme involved solvent extraction using 0.1 M TODGA + 0.5 M DHOA for separation of americium from Fe, Pb, Ni and Na followed by extraction chromatographic technique using CMPO on inert support as stationary phase for separation of Ca from Am. A systematic study on the extraction behavior of Am from hydrochloric acid medium revealed that out of four extraction systems well known for actinide partitioning namely 0.1 M TODGA + 0.5 M DHOA, 1 M DMDBTDMA, 0.2 M CMPO + 1.2 M TBP and 30% TRPO, only 0.1 M TODGA + 0.5 M DHOA extracts americium from 7.5 MHCl feed acidity. A comparative study involving CMPO solvent extraction and column chromatographic technique revealed that elution of Am from column is satisfactory as compared to inefficient stripping of Am from organic phase in solvent extraction technique using 0.1 M HNO3. The purity of the final solution was checked for 17 elements of interest and was found to be 98% pure, while the overall recovery of this two step separation scheme was found to be 95%.
