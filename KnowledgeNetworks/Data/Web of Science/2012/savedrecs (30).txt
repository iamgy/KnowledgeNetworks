J	Eriksen, TE; Shoesmith, DW; Jonsson, M				Eriksen, Trygve E.; Shoesmith, David W.; Jonsson, Mats			Radiation induced dissolution of UO2 based nuclear fuel - A critical review of predictive modelling approaches	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Review							H2O2 CONCENTRATION PROFILES; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE SOLUTIONS; WASTE-DISPOSAL CONDITIONS; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; SPENT-FUEL; OXIDATIVE DISSOLUTION; ALPHA-RADIOLYSIS; FISSION-PRODUCTS; OXIDIZING CONDITIONS; UNIRRADIATED UO2	Radiation induced dissolution of uranium dioxide (UO2) nuclear fuel and the consequent release of radionuclides to intruding groundwater are key-processes in the safety analysis of future deep geological repositories for spent nuclear fuel. For several decades, these processes have been studied experimentally using both spent fuel and various types of simulated spent fuels. The latter have been employed since it is difficult to draw mechanistic conclusions from real spent nuclear fuel experiments. Several predictive modelling approaches have been developed over the last two decades. These models are largely based on experimental observations. In this work we have performed a critical review of the modelling approaches developed based on the large body of chemical and electrochemical experimental data. The main conclusions are: (1) the use of measured interfacial rate constants give results in generally good agreement with experimental results compared to simulations where homogeneous rate constants are used; (2) the use of spatial dose rate distributions is particularly important when simulating the behaviour over short time periods; and (3) the steady-state approach (the rate of oxidant consumption is equal to the rate of oxidant production) provides a simple but fairly accurate alternative, but errors in the reaction mechanism and in the kinetic parameters used may not be revealed by simple benchmarking. It is essential to use experimentally determined rate constants and verified reaction mechanisms, irrespective of whether the approach is chemical or electrochemical. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

On the electrochemical formation of Pu-Al alloys in molten LiCl-KCl	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							BEHAVIOR; PLUTONIUM; CATHODES; ALUMINUM; URANIUM; NP; ELECTRODES; SEPARATION; FUEL	Properties of Pu-Al alloys were investigated in connection with development of pyrochemical methods for reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. Electroseparation techniques in molten LiCl-KCl are being developed in ITU to group-selectively recover actinides from the mixture with fission products. In the process, actinides are electrochemically reduced on solid aluminium cathodes, forming solid actinide-aluminium alloys. This article is focused on electro-chemical characterisation of Pu-Al alloys in molten LiCl-KCl, on electrodeposition of Pu on solid Al electrodes and on determination of chemical composition and structure of the formed alloys. Cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry were used to study Pu-Al alloys in the temperature range 400-550 degrees C. Pu is reduced to metal in one reduction step Pu3+/Pu-0 on an inert W electrode. On a reactive Al electrode, the reduction of Pu3+ to Pu-0 occurs at a more positive potential due to formation of Pu-Al alloys. The open circuit potential technique was used to identify the alloys formed. Stable deposits were obtained by potentiostatic electrolyses of LiCl-KCl-PuCl3 melts on Al plates. XRD and SEM-EDX analyses were used to characterise the alloys, which were composed mainly of PuAl4 with some PuAl3. In addition, the preparation of PuCl3 containing salt by carbochlorination of PuO2 is described. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effect of proton irradiation on deuterium diffusion in zirconium oxide layer	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							OXIDATION; ALLOYS; TEMPERATURE; STRESS; ZIRCALOY-4; KINETICS; CRYSTAL; PLASMA; FILMS	Deuterium diffusion in proton-irradiated oxide layer of zirconium alloy has been in situ examined at 573 K by using a combined technique of deuterium plasma exposure and nuclear reaction analysis of the D(He-3,p)He-4 reaction. The zirconium alloy used was GNF-Ziron (a high iron Zircaloy-2 type alloy), which had been corroded in high temperature steam, producing an oxide layer of 1.6-1.7 mu m thickness. Oxidized specimens were irradiated at ambient temperature with 350 keV H+ ions, and the total fluence was 1 x 10(17) cm(-2). An outer non-protective oxide layer of 0.5-0.6 mu m thickness, which was observed in the unirradiated oxide layer, evolved into the protective barrier oxide due to the proton irradiation. The evaluated diffusion coefficients in the barrier layer were almost identical for both the unirradiated and irradiated oxides. From X-ray diffraction measurements, lattice expansion and high compressive stress were found in the proton-irradiated oxide. The most probable mechanism for evolution of the diffusion property in the irradiated oxide was ascribed to the increase of the compressive stress induced by the constraint of the damage-accumulated oxide layer by the thick metal substrate.

Cement mortar-degraded spinney waste composite as a matrix for immobilizing some low and intermediate level radioactive wastes: Consistency under frost attack	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							RESISTANCE; CONCRETE; WATER	The increasing amounts of spinning waste fibers generated from cotton fabrication are problematic subject. Simultaneous shortage in the landfill disposal space is also the most problem associated with dumping of these wastes. Cement mortar composite was developed by hydrating mortar components using the waste slurry obtained from wet oxidative degradation of these spinney wastes. The consistency of obtained composite was determined under freeze-thaw events. Frost resistance was assessed for the mortar composite specimens by evaluating its compressive strength, apparent porosity and mass loss at the end of each period of freeze-thaw up to 45 cycles. Scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses were performed for samples subjected to frost attack aiming at evaluating the cement mortar in the presence of degraded spinney waste. The cement mortar composite exhibits acceptable resistance and durability against the freeze-thaw treatment that could be chosen in radioactive waste management as immobilizing agent for some low and intermediate level radioactive wastes.

Temperature dependence of surface morphology and deuterium retention in polycrystalline ITER-grade tungsten exposed to low-energy, high-flux D plasma	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							DEPTHS	Surface topography and deuterium retention in polycrystalline ITER-grade tungsten have been examined after exposure to a low-energy (38 eV/D), high-flux (10(22) D/m(2) s) deuterium plasma with ion fluences of 10(26) and 10(27) D/m(2) at various temperatures. The methods used were scanning electron microscopy equipped with focused ion beam, thermal desorption spectroscopy. and the D(He-3,p)He-4 nuclear reaction at He-3 energies varied from 0.69 to 4.0 MeV. During exposure to the D plasma at temperatures in the range from 320 to 815 K, small blisters of size in the range from 0.2 to 5 mu m, depending on the exposure temperature and ion fluence, are formed on the W surface. At an ion fluence of 10(27) D/m(2), the deuterium retention increases with the exposure temperature, reaching its maximum value of about 10(22) D/m(2) at 500 K, and then decreases below 10(19) D/m(2) at 800 K.

Recycling of LiCl-KCl eutectic based salt wastes containing radioactive rare earth oxychlorides or oxides	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							TEMPERATURE VAPORIZATION BEHAVIOR; SPENT NUCLEAR-FUEL; VACUUM DISTILLATION; PRECIPITATION; SEPARATION; PHOSPHATE; MIXTURE; MELTS	Recycling of LiCl-KCl eutectic salt wastes containing radioactive rare earth oxychlorides or oxides was studied to recover renewable salts from the salt wastes and to minimize the radioactive wastes by using a vacuum distillation method. Vaporization of the LiCl-KCl eutectic salt was effective above 900 degrees C and at 5 Torr. The condensations of the vaporized salt were largely dependent on temperature gradient. Based on these results, a recycling system of the salt wastes as a closed loop type was developed to obtain a high efficiency of the salt recovery condition. In this system, it was confirmed that renewable salt was recovered at more than 99 wt.% from the salt wastes, and the changes in temperature and pressure in the system could be utilized to understand the present condition of the system operation.

Metallurgical characterizations of Fe-Cr-Ni-Zr base alloys developed for geological disposal of radioactive hulls	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							BARIUM BOROSILICATE GLASS; STAINLESS-STEEL; PROPERTY EVALUATION; PHASE-RELATIONS; CLADDING HULLS; OXIDE-FILMS; WASTE FORM; SYSTEM; IMMOBILIZATION; CORROSION	Alloy melting route is currently being considered for radioactive hulls immobilization. Towards this, wide range of alloys, belonging to Zirconium-Iron binary and Zirconium-Stainless steel pseudo-binary systems have been prepared through vacuum arc melting route. Detail microstructural characterization and quantitative phase analyses of these alloys along with interaction study between Zirconium and Stainless steel coupons at elevated temperatures identify Zr(Fe,Cr)(2), Zr(Fe,Cr), Zr-2(Fe,Cr), Zr-3(Fe,Ni), Zr-3(Fe,Cr), Zr-3(Fe,Cr,Ni), beta-Zr and alpha-Zr as the most commonly occurring phases within the system for Zirconium rich bulk compositions. Nano-indentation studies found Zr(Fe,Cr)(2) and Zr(Fe,Cr) as extremely hard, Zr-3(Fe,Ni) as moderately ductile and beta-Zr, Zr-2(Fe,Cr) as most ductile ones among the phases present. Steam oxidation studies of the alloys, based on weight gain/loss procedure and microstructural characterization of the mixed oxide layers, suggest that each of the alloys responded to the corrosive environment differently. Fe2O3, NiFe2O4, NiO, monoclinic ZrO2 and tetragonal ZrO2 are found to be most common constituents of the oxide layers developed on the alloys. Integrating the microstructural, mechanical and corrosion properties, ZrFeCrNi3 (Zr: 84.00, Fe: 11.20, Cr: 3.20, Ni: 1.60, in wt.%) is identified as the acceptable base alloy for disposal of radioactive hulls.

But today's fission technology cannot accomplish this without adding to the ever-increasing volume of high-level waste; these waste concerns may be the limiting factor in the use of nuclear power. Breeder reactors had been considered as a way to solve this problem; however, because of cost and proliferation concerns, breeders are increasingly unlikely to he commercialized. In an attempt to allow nuclear power to reach its full economic potential, General Atomics is developing the Energy Multiplier Module (EM2). EM2 is a gas-cooled compact fast reactor that augments its fissile fuel load with either spent fuel or depleted uranium. This provides the additional fertile material to allow the reactor to both create and burn fuel in situ. This results in a core that will last decades without fuel supplementation or shuffling. The end-of-cycle fuel can be treated in a manner that does not separate actinides, permitting reuse in subsequent generations at reduced proliferation risk. Proliferation resistance is further enhanced because no enrichment is required beyond that needed jar the first generation fuel load. Waste problems are mitigated by several factors: higher burnup, fuel use in multiple generations, and conversion of existing waste to energy.

This paper will focus on the applications of such accelerators in support of nuclear energy, and in particular on the two following cases: the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF), which asks for a 10 MW, 40 MeV deuteron beam, and the ADS (Accelerator Driven System) application for transmutation of long-lived radioactive wastes, which typically requires a 600 MeV - 1 GeV proton beam of a few mA for demonstrators, and a few tens of mA for large industrial systems. In this respect, the status of the accelerator proposed for the European MYRRHA project will be detailed and discussed.

TRITIUM RECOVERY FROM LIQUID BLANKET SYSTEMS FOR FUSION REACTOR	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th International Conference on Emerging Nuclear Energy Systems	MAY 15-19, 2011	San Francisco, CA				HYDROGEN ISOTOPES; LI-PB; DIFFUSION; DESIGN	Systems to recover tritium (T) from fusion liquid blankets of LiPb (Li17Pb83) and Flibe (Li2BeF4) under safety conditions are discussed based on available data of T transport properties. We recently performed experiments on hydrogen isotopes permeating through LiPb in Kyushu University and introduced them in the present paper. Solubilities, diffusivities and permeabilities of H and D through Li17Pb83 are determined by means of a transient permeation method. Their isotope effects between H and D in the Li-Pb eutectic alloy are found to be independent of D/H atomic ratio and a function of only temperature. Tritium recovery apparatuses of a liquid-gas counter-current flowing bed or a T permeation window are designed in the liquid blanket system composed of the primary coolant of Flibe or LiPb and the secondary coolant of He or water. Simultaneous transfer of heat and T needs new configuration in order to satisfy the necessary conditions of low T leak and high heat transfer, which make it possible to operate the blanket effectively and safely. Tritium permeation rates through the primary LiPb or Flibe breeder and secondary water or He coolant loops are estimated, which is the most important factor to operate the blanket safely.

To this end, structural materials on the basis of both low-activation steels and refractory metals, as well as concepts for breeding blankets and divertor designs, are being developed along with suitable manufacturing and joining technologies. In parallel, KIT contributes to the engineering design and validation phase of the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF) necessary for qualifying the materials to be used in an FPP. The specific characteristics of an FPP fuel cycle, i.e., substantial tritium quantities within huge mass flows of gases and the related tritium compatible high throughput vacuum and pumping technologies, are being translated into viable engineering approaches. High temperature superconducting magnet solutions are being developed, with a view to overall plant efficiency. In order to increase the wall-plug efficiency of plasma heating, advanced gyrotron tubes with power levels significantly beyond what is envisaged fir ITER are being developed along with a frequency tunability option for efficiently counteracting plasma instabilities.

Two beds were packed with Pd and LaNi4.7Al0.3, which show positive and inverse isotope effects, respectively. The separation efficiency was studied experimentally in terms of stoichiometry between hydrogen and adsorbents, cycles, and extraction ratio. The experimental results show that a steady distribution of hydrogen isotopes along the axial direction can be obtained within an operating period of three cycles and a 10% extraction ratio at a moderate H/Pd atomic ratio. The results of a tritium enrichment experiment carried out under optimized conditions indicate that good enrichment efficiency is possible using this method to separate a three-component gas when the extraction ratio is kept small. Since the column used in this experiment is relatively short, there is great potential for this method for meeting the requirements of large-scale operations if long columns or multi-bed combined systems are employed.

It can burn SNF from LWRs with no reprocessing, only refabrication. The core can be recycled using an AIROX-based method to remove a fraction of the fission products (FPs) but no heavy metals. The reactor is passively safe and sited below grade. It can sustain a Fukushima type station blackout or even a station blackout combined with a loss of coolant accident using only passive safety systems without radioactivity release or loss of plant. The afterheat is rejected directly to the air. It is a high temperature reactor and employs a direct closed-cycle gas turbine for 48% net efficiency. The reject heat can be released directly to air so that siting near a large water source is not required. GA is targeting a power cost in the range of 6-7 cents/kW-hr, which would make it a competitive power source even with low-cost natural gas. This ambitious power cost is achieved through high efficiency, simplicity of the direct cycle gas turbine power and relatively small subsystems that can be shop fabricated and shipped by road to the site.

It has been demonstrated that this array can be used to measure the statistical properties of the neutrons emitted in single fission chains. The multiple time scales over which these fission neutrons are correlated allow one to deduce quite a lot regarding the nature of the fissile assembly. In this paper we will describe how neutron correlations measured with a liquid scintillator array can be used to assay the amounts of fissile elements in reprocessed and spent nuclear fuels.

ANALYSIS OF A HYPOTHETICAL ITALIAN FUEL CYCLE: TRANSITION TO FAST REACTORS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th International Conference on Emerging Nuclear Energy Systems	MAY 15-19, 2011	San Francisco, CA					In order to investigate the impact of nuclear energy introduction in a country with a fossil fuel based energy mix, several scenarios have been compared in terms of fuel cycle needs (resources and infrastructure) and wastes produced. As case study, the Italian situation (represented by ca. 300 TWhe-y of electricity needs in 2007 and by no nuclear energy production at present) has been selected. However, the obtained results could he extrapolated to other countries by means of scale factors. For the reference scenario, the introduction of Gen.III+ Light Water Reactors and once-through fuel cycle has been considered. Under the hypothesis that only the plutonium produced in the country will be available and used for a possible transition to a fast fleet, the introduction of different types of fast reactors (a 600 MWe lead-cooled and two 1500 MWe sodium-cooled systems with different breeding characteristics) and of a more sustainable fuel cycle (closed or partially closed) have been compared. The adoption of fast systems enables to reduce of 50% the uranium consumption and to favorably impact the cycle back-end by reducing the Pu inventory in the cycle, and by reducing the long term waste radiotoxicity and heat load in a repository.

Based on the current or slightly extrapolated ITER fusion science and technology and the well developed fission technology, fusion-driven sub-critical systems design was performed. We put forward the main concept of FFHER blanket with uranium alloy as fuel and water as coolant. The uranium can be natural uranium, LWR spent fuel or depleted uranium. FFHER can increase the utilization rate of uranium in a comparatively simple way to sustain the development of nuclear energy. We study the interaction among the fusion neutron and fuel to achieve larger energy multiplication and tritium sustainable, verify the creditability of physical design by the integral neutron experiments. With the combination research of this program and the following thermal hydraulic design, alloy fuel manufacture and nuclear fuel cycle programs provide the science and technology foundation for the future development of FFHER in China.

J	Miley, GH; Boyer, B				Miley, George H.; Boyer, Bradley			FUSION-FISSION HYBRID USING A D-D CYLINDRICAL INERTIAL ELECTROSTATIC CONFINEMENT (IEC) DRIVER	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th International Conference on Emerging Nuclear Energy Systems	MAY 15-19, 2011	San Francisco, CA					Recent progress in fusion development combined with the rebirth of nuclear fission power has regenerated interest in fusion-fission hybrid reactors. Such systems could be applied to both low power research reactors for use in University and industrial research assemblies and power reactors. However most attention has been directed at D-T fusion drivers using Tokamak, ICF or various alternate confinement systems like FRCs. However, the necessity to have large devices and breed tritium in the blanket complicates the concept. Here we propose the inertial electrostatic confinement (IEC) fusion approach since it offers the advantages of simple structural, high power density and a non-Maxwellian beam dominated plasma suited for burning advanced fuels to minimize tritium involvement. The cylindrical IEC allows a small compact unit which can be inserted into fuel element slots in the fission reactor core, thus providing a compact overall system and excellent neutronic coupling. The basic physics for the IEC has been demonstrated in small-scale laboratory experiments close to levels needed for driving a subcritical assembly for use in student teaching labs. However, for use in future high power hybrids significant scale-up in source strength is required. Scale up using an external ion source (e.g. a Helicon) so the background gas pressure is minimized in the reaction zone potentially offers a route to the required neutron source strength.

Laser Inertial Confinement Fusion Fission Energy (LIFE) engine is considered to incinerate RG-plutonium in stockpiles. Calculations have been conducted for a constant fusion driver power of 500 MWth in S-8-P-3 approximation using 238-neutron groups. RG-plutonium out of the nuclear waste of LWRs is used in form of fissile carbide fuel in TRISO particles with volume fractions of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 %, homogenously dispersed in the Flibe coolant. Respective tritium breeding ratio (TBR) values per incident fits ion neutron are calculated as TBR = 1.35, 1.52, 1.73, 2.02 and 2.47 at start-up. With the burn up of fissionable RG-Pu isotopes in the coolant, TBR decreases gradually. Similarly, blanket energy multiplications are calculated as M-0 = 3.8, 5.5, 7.7, 10.8 and 15.4 at start-up, respectively. Calculations have indicated prospects of achievability of very high burn up values (> 400 000 MD.D/MT).

COMPACT TOKAMAKS AS CONVENIENT NEUTRON SOURCES FOR HYBRID REACTORS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th International Conference on Emerging Nuclear Energy Systems	MAY 15-19, 2011	San Francisco, CA					The foreseen future expansion of nuclear power would involve a solution to burn the long half-life transuranics (TRU) in the spent nuclear fuel discharged from LWRs. Moreover, high-energy neutrons can be very useful for many processes. The study addresses the development of a tokamak neutron source for a hybrid fission-fusion demonstration experimental device, using Ignitor-based technologies. Ignitor is a proposed compact high magnetic field tokamak, aimed at reaching ignition in DT plasmas. A revision of its operating parameters, in order to act a as a suitable neutron source in a hybrid device, is discussed, and a new operating scenario is proposed. Features of the tokamak neutron source are illustrated and preliminary results are discussed. A two-phase project is described, in order to test an Ignitor-based neutron source and then implement an experimental device for demonstration of technical feasibility of TRU transmutation.

J	Kammash, T				Kammash, Terry			A FUSION HYBRID REACTOR BASED ON THE GASDYNAMIC MIRROR (GDM)	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th International Conference on Emerging Nuclear Energy Systems	MAY 15-19, 2011	San Francisco, CA					A fusion-fission hybrid reactor whose fusion component is the gasdynamic mirror (GDM) is proposed for power production that could meet the world's energy needs of the next several decades. The choice of the GDM is based on the fact that it is linear, axisymmetric and can operate in steady state. Since the primary role of the fusion component is to supply neutrons to the blanket, it can operate at or near "breakeven" condition, a much less stringent condition than that required for a pure fusion reactor. A large aspect ratio GDM is desirable because of MHD stability considerations, and if we choose such a geometry then a cylindrically symmetric plasma with a surrounding blanket can be treated as semi-infinite cylinders, allowing for the reactor performance to be determined by two, one-dimensional equations: one describing the time evolution of the fissile material density bred in the fertile blanket, and another describing the diffusion of fast neutrons in that region. Our choice for the blanket material is thorium-232 in order to take advantage of the thorium fuel cycle that leads to the breeding of uranium-233. Such a fuel cycle is known to be resistant to proliferation and clandestine operations. We choose to operate the GDM at 0.10 of breakeven, using deuterium-tritium (DT) plasma at a density of 10(16) cm(-3), and a temperature of 10keV. We find that for a reasonable design, such a reactor can generate tens of megawatts of thermal power per cm "safely" because it is "subcritical", and "securely" because of our choice of the fuel cycle. A systems analysis reveals that about 2% of the net electric power is needed to sustain the fusion component. Moreover, we find that it takes approximately 4 months to reach steady state due to the several steps involved in the breeding cycle.

FISSION-SUPPRESSED FUSION, THORIUM-CYCLE BREEDER AND NONPROLIFERATION	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th International Conference on Emerging Nuclear Energy Systems	MAY 15-19, 2011	San Francisco, CA					Fusion reactors can be designed to breed fissile material for startup and makeup fuel for fission reactors while suppressing fissioning, thereby enhancing safety. Each fusion reaction can release about 2.1 times the 14 MeV neutron's energy in the blanket in this fission-suppressed design while producing 0.6 fissile atoms, which is 2660 kg/1000 MW of fusion power for a full power year. The revenues would be doubled from such a plant by selling both fuel at a price of $60/g and electricity at $0.05/kWh for Q=P-fusion/P-input=4. Fusion reactors could also be designed to destroy fission wastes by fissioning, but this is not a natural use of fusion whereas it is a designed use of fission reactors. Fusion could supply makeup fuel to fission reactors dedicated to fissioning wastes with some of their neutrons. The design for safety and heat removal is already accomplished with fission reactors; however, fusion reactors have geometry that compromises safety with a complex and thin wall separating the fusion zone from the fission blanket zone. Fusion is (unique) under bar compared to fission in that its high-energy 14 MeV neutron can generate up to 0.05 (232) U atoms for each (233) U atom produced from thorium, about twice the IAEA standards of "reduced protection" or "self protection."

Plutonium and heavy water moderator can give a good combination with respect to neutron economy. TRISO type fuel can withstand very high fuel burn up levels. The paper investigates the prospects of utilization of TRISO fuel made of WG-plutonium in CANDU reactors. Three different fuel compositions have been investigated: (1): 90 % ThC + 10 % PuC, (2): 70 % ThC + 30 % PziC and (3): 50 ThC + 50 % PuC. The temporal variation of the criticality k(infinity) and the burn-up values of the reactor have been calculated by full power operation up to 17 years. Calculated startup criticalities for these fuel modes are k(infinity),(0) = 1.6403, 1.7228, 1.7662, respectively. Attainable burn up values and reactor operation times with the same fuel charge will be 94 700, 265 000, 425 000 MW.D/MT and similar to 3.5, 10, 17 years, respectively. These high burn ups would reduce fuel fabrication costs and nuclear waste mass for final disposal per unit energy drastically.

FAST ACCELERATOR DRIVEN SUBCRITICAL SYSTEM FOR ENERGY PRODUCTION USING BURNED FUEL	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th International Conference on Emerging Nuclear Energy Systems	MAY 15-19, 2011	San Francisco, CA			ADS; thorium; MCNPX		Accelerators Driven Systems (ADS) are an innovative type of nuclear system, which is useful for long-lived fission product transmutation and fuel regeneration. The ADS consist of a coupling of a sub-critical nuclear core reactor and a proton beam produced by a particle accelerator. These particles are injected into a target for neutrons production by spallation reactions. The neutrons are then used to maintain the fission chain in the subcritical core. The aim of this study is to investigate the nuclear fuel evolution of a lead cooled accelerator driven system used for energy production and high-level waste transmutation. The fuel studied is a mixture based upon Th-232- U-233 and Pu- MA extracted from PWR spent. The target is a lead spallation target and the core is filled with a hexagonal lattice. In order to reduce the negative reactivity caused by the presence of protactinium, moderator is not used. In this work is used the Monte Carlo code MCNPX 2.6.0, that presents the depletion/ burnup capability, combining a ADS source and kcode-mode. The k(ff) evolution, the neutron energy spectra in the core and the nuclear fuel depletion during the burn up are evaluated.

COMPARISON OF THE WASTE TRANSMUTATION POTENTIAL OF DIFFERENT INNOVATIVE DEDICATED SYSTEMS AND IMPACT ON THE FUEL CYCLE	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th International Conference on Emerging Nuclear Energy Systems	MAY 15-19, 2011	San Francisco, CA					The performances of three different types of innovative transmutation systems have been investigated in order to assess in a comparative way their potential to manage nuclear waste arising in a geographical region, where different countries have different policies with respect to nuclear energy development, but share the objective of a common optimized waste management strategy in order to minimize the waste masses sent to a geological repository. The three systems are 1) a critical low conversion ratio fast reactor (LCFR); 2) an accelerator driven system (ADS) and 3) a hybrid fission-fusion system (FFH). In order to simplify the comparison, the three systems have been loaded with comparable fuels, in particular with the same Pu to Minor Actinides (MA) ratio. A waste management scenario study has been performed: the results show that, apart from the technological readiness of each single option, the performances, in terms e.g. of time needed to eliminate specific spent fuel inventories or in terms of reduction of decay heat and radiotoxicity in a deep geological repository, are rather comparable.

A gas turbine high-temperature reactor of 300 MWe nominal capacity (GTHTR300) was assumed as the calculation target of a typical gas-cooled reactor, and using the continuous-energy Monte Carlo transport code MVP-BURN, burn-up simulations for the entire-core region of GTHTR300 were carried out considering its unique double heterogeneity structure. It was shown that gas-cooled reactors with thermal output power of 3 GW in all can produce 6 similar to 10 kg of tritium in a year.

THEORETICAL MODELING OF RADIAL STANDING WAVE REACTOR	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th International Conference on Emerging Nuclear Energy Systems	MAY 15-19, 2011	San Francisco, CA					This paper is a theoretical study of a radial standing wave, which can be applied in the so-called traveling wave reactor (TWR). Two-dimensional cylindrical core geometry is considered and the fuel is assumed to drift radially, which corresponds to a radial fuel shuffling scheme in practice. A one-group diffusion equation coupled with burn-up equations is set up, where the burn-up solution is obtained numerically. The uranium-plutonium (U-Pu) conversion cycle with pure U-238 as fresh fuel is considered under conditions of a typical sodium cooled fast reactor with metallic uranium fuel loaded. The asymptotic problem is solved by a time-stepping iteration scheme and the radial standing wave solution is obtained together with certain eigenvalue k(eff).. The neutron flux, the neutron fluence and the net neutron generation cross section are presented and discussed for the inward fuel drifting motion.

THERMO-MECHANICAL EVALUATION OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE REFRACTORY FOAMS USED IN THERMAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th International Conference on Emerging Nuclear Energy Systems	MAY 15-19, 2011	San Francisco, CA				FLOW	Refractory metallic foams can increase heat transfer efficiency in gas-to-gas and liquid metal-to-gas heat exchangers by providing an extended surface area for better convection, i.e. conduction into the foam ligaments providing a 'fin-effect," and by disruption of the thermal boundary layer near the hot wall and ligaments by turbulence promotion. We present the relative contributions of the heat transfer mechanisms stated above, and show how the design of a gas regenerator or liquid metal-to-gas heat exchanger can be optimized for use in high-temperature Brayton cycle applications for nuclear power generation or hydrogen production. Our results include temperature and thermal stress distributions for several densities of Nb1Zr, Mo and W foams compared to Cu. For instance, the simulations reveal that unconnected W foam can increase the convective heat transfer coefficient by almost a factor of two compared to an open rectangular channel and a factor of three if the foam ligaments are thermally connected to the sidewalls under the same flow conditions. The effect of ligament thermal conductivity is also highlighted by comparing the performance of W foams to identical Cu foams and the use of SiC foams in thermal barrier applications. The studies indicate that thermal stresses increase with foam density, but are not clearly correlated with pore cell size. For thermal management applications, the presence of the connected foam minimizes the thermal stresses in the wall, by concentrating them in the ligaments where the temperature gradients are higher. In addition, the large number of small connected ligaments provides a modest degree of compliance for thermal expansion of the hotter walls in relation to the colder portions of the heat exchanger. These CFD studies have led to design strategies for creating compact, high-temperature, high-pressure heat exchangers that are easily fabricated and perform better than plate-type heat exchangers.

Preliminary core design studies have been carried out focused on maximizing the power level compatibly with natural circulation cooling and transportability requirements, while meeting the foremost goals of (i) providing energy security and proliferation resistance thanks to a long life core design, (ii) minimizing the reactivity swing over the fuel lifetime, and (iii) flattening the radial power profiles, as demanded by the choice of wrapper-less fuel assemblies and by the stringent technological constraints imposed by the short-time-to-deployment feature. Once established appropriate geometrical pin and fuel assembly specifications, a suitable active height allowing the system to be cooled by free-flowing lead has finally been set through parametric T/H analyses. Fuel cycle calculations have been then performed to optimize both the fresh fire! composition and the radial enrichment zoning. Moreover, the use of several absorbing materials has been investigated in order to guarantee enhanced safety by incorporating control elements having a net density greater than that of the surrounding lead coolant. A complete static neutronic characterization of the resulting core has been finally accomplished.

For this work, it evaluated the neutronic behavior and fuel composition during the burnup using the codes (Winfrith Improved Multi-Group Scheme) WIMSD5 and the MCNPX2.6, inserting different percentages of reprocessed fuel in the core. The fuel type "C" coming from Angra-I nuclear power plant, in Brazil, enriched with 3.1% was burnt by three typical cycles and then reprocessed. It recovered (Pu) and minor actinides (MA)being neptunium (Np), americium (Am), curium (Cm), and processed six different fuels varying percentage insertion of reprocessed fuel and enrichment uranium. It analyzed the multiplication factor, temperatures reactivity coefficients, and the composition during the burnup. The results showed, in the analyzed conditions, only one of these fuels is possible to be used. To compare, a reference fuel using 15% enrichment (U-235) was too evaluated.

VALIDATION OF REAL TIME DISPERSION OF TRITIUM OVER THE WESTERN MEDITERRANEAN BASIN IN DIFFERENT ASSESMENTS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th International Conference on Emerging Nuclear Energy Systems	MAY 15-19, 2011	San Francisco, CA					Real time Tritium concentrations in air coming from an ITER-like reactor as source were coupled the European Centre Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) numerical model with the lagrangian atmospheric dispersion model FLEXPART. This tool ECMWF/FLEXPART was analyzed in normal operating conditions in the Western Mediterranean Basin during 45 days at summer 2010. From comparison with NORMTRI plumes over Western Mediterranean Basin [1] the real time results have demonstrated an overestimation of the corresponding climatologically sequence Tritium concentrations in air outputs, at several distances from the reactor. For these purpose two clouds development patterns were established. The first one was following a cyclonic circulation over the Mediterranean Sea and the second one was based in the cloud delivered over the Interior of the Iberian Peninsula by another stabilized circulation corresponding to a High. One of the important remaining activities defined then, was the tool qualification. The aim of this paper is to present the ECMWF/FLEXPART products confronted with Tritium concentration in air data. For this purpose a database to develop and validate ECMWF/FLEXPART tritium in both assessments has been selected from a NORMTRI run. Similarities and differences, underestimation and overestimation with NORMTRI will allow for refinement in some features of ECMWF/FLEXPART.	[Castro, P.; Sedano, L.

In the first version of GB, code described the behavior during the burn up of only 25 isotopes. The amount of isotopes to be considered in the simulation was increased in the GB version used in this paper (named GB5). It was simulated 75 time steps at 800kw of a Heat Pipe Power System model. Results showed that GB5 is able to generate very similar results compared to MCNPA2.6.0. The small difference encountered with the neutron flux parameter between GB5 and MCNPX2.6.0 is explained by the form that recoverable energy per fission is calculated in GB5. Radiotoxicity and radioactivity results are also presented.

A CASE STUDY ON A NEW COOLANT	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th International Conference on Emerging Nuclear Energy Systems	MAY 15-19, 2011	San Francisco, CA					Extensive exploitation of nuclear raw materials requires the use of "nuclear breeding", which is a phenomenon that can be attained in fast reactors. However, those reactors have had a complex history with some drawbacks and some important nuclear-policy attacks, as the INFCE initiative launched inside IAEA in 1978. Two points were very relevant in that context: the extensive use of plutonium recycling and an inherent property of fast reactors that could induce positive feedback between reactivity and thermal-hydraulics. In fact, a partial or total loss of coolant could convey a tremendous injection of reactivity, which could produce a catastrophe. An alternative to breeding in critical fast reactors is presented by hybrids, which are subcritical reactors which need an external neutron source for keeping their neutron population alive. Besides that, design and natural responses of the reactor systems against accidental initiating events have to be considered for arriving to the concept of Residual Safety beyond Design Limits. Such a final safety level will depend quite a lot on the type of coolant and the way the fuel is conformed into elements of a given geometry.

Heavy-water and graphite moderated critical reactors can extract energy from natural uranium but offer a very low uranium utilization (low discharge burnup). The objective of the present study is to explore the feasibility of achieving high fuel utilization without resorting to enrichment and reprocessing using spallation neutron source driven subcritical reactors. Three different high burnup once through subcritical nuclear systems are investigated: a fluoride salt cooled high temperature reactor (FHR) with pebble fuel, a helium cooled core with sphere pack fuel based on General Atomics' EM2 reactor concept, and a sodium cooled fast reactor that is loaded with fuel discharged from a high burnup Breed-and-Burn (B&B) fast reactor that is fed with depleted uranium, after removing the gaseous fission products and inserting the voided fuel rods into a new clad (without removing the old one). The pebble fuel design and fuel cycle for the FHR concept was optimized for maximum electric power multiplication using natural thorium fuelled subcritical core. The maximum attainable power multiplication was not high enough to merit future studies. The optimal discharge burnup of the fuel in the EM2 type subcritical core was found to be approximately 30% FIMA and the corresponding power multiplication was found higher than in the FHR but still not high enough for practical applications. Significantly better performance was obtained from the sodium-cooled source-driven core that is fed with metallic U-TRU-Zr fuel discharged at 20% FIMA from a critical B&B fast reactor that underwent recladding. The maximum attainable power multiplication was found to be close to 10 while fissioning an additional 20% of the loaded heavy metal.

MULTISTAGE FUSION REACTION RATES IN AN ADIABATICALLY COMPRESSED PLASMA	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th International Conference on Emerging Nuclear Energy Systems	MAY 15-19, 2011	San Francisco, CA				WALL; PHYSICS	We consider a dense gas of deuterium to undergo a rapid, adiabatic compression by a piston in a chamber. A reduction in the degrees of freedom of the plasma particles, such as may be effected by an electric discharge during the compression or by the application of magnetic fields, results in a higher final temperature for a given compression ratio. In model calculations we consider the adiabatic compression of one mole of molecular deuterium modeled as a van der Waals gas initially at room temperature and we compare the subsequent fusion energy release with the work done by the piston for various values of compression ratio and degrees of freedom. Prior work considered fusion to occur only at the end of the compression while the present work considers fusion energy released at various stages during the compression. Higher final temperatures and ratios of output to input energy result from this refinement of the model.

The experiments consisted of bare plutonium metal hemishells reflected by steel hemishells of increasing thickness and motor oil. The hemishell assembly was suspended within dual aluminum tanks. Criticality was achieved by pumping oil into the tanks such that effectively infinite reflection was achieved in all directions except directly above the assembly; then the critical oil height was recorded. The results of these experiments had been initially ignored because early computational methods had been inadequate to analyze partially reflected configurations. The dominant uncertainties include the uncertainty in the average plutonium density and the composition of materials in the gaps between the plutonium hemishells. Simple and detailed benchmark models were developed. Eigenvalue calculations using MCNP5 and ENDF/B-VII.0 were within 2 sigma of the benchmark values. This benchmark evaluation has been added to the International Handbook of Evaluated Criticality Safety Benchmark Experiments.

By using this erbia credit, the new fuel can be treated as <5 wt% enriched fuel, and most modifications to the existing facilities and equipment can be avoided. One of the key issues far developing the Er-SHB fuel is to validate the criticality safety analysis tools for this fuel based on a series of experiments using fuel with small amounts of erbia in the entire core. For that purpose, a series of critical experiments have been performed at the Kyoto University Critical Assembly (KUCA). Four critical cores were constructed utilizing two different average enrichments, three different ethic, contents, and four different H/U ratios. Numerical analyses have also been performed using several different cross-section libraries, and the results were compared with the measurements from the KUCA experiments. These results confirm the validity of the calculations and the cross-section libraries for determining erbia reactivity. This paper outlines the basic Concepts of the Er-SHB fuel, the erbia experiments, and the analyses results.

ANALYSIS OF MERCI DECAY HEAT MEASUREMENT FOR PWR UO2 FUEL ROD	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						decay heat; MERCI experiment; PEPIN2-JEFF3.1.1 validation	THERMAL-NEUTRON FISSION; PRODUCT ENERGY-RELEASE; PU-239; U-235	Decay heat measurements, called the MERCI experiment, were conducted at Commissariat a l 'Energie Atomique (CEA)/Saclay to characterize accurately residual power at short cooling time and verify its prediction by decay code and nuclear data. The MOSAIC calorimeter, developed and patented by CEA/Grenoble (DTN/SE2T), enables measurement of the decay heat released by a pressurized water reactor (PWR) fuel rod sample between 200 and 4 W within a precision of 1%. The MERCI experiment included three phases. At first, a UO2 fuel rod sample was irradiated in the CEA/Saclay experimental reactor OSIRIS. The burnup achieved at the end of irradiation was similar to 3.5 GWd/tonne. The second phase was the transfer of the fuel rod sample from its irradiation location to a hot cell, to be inserted inside the MOSAIC calorimeter. It took 26 min to carry out the transfer. Finally, decay heat released by the PWR sample was measured from 27 min to 42 days after shutdown. Postirradiation examinations were performed to measure concentrations of some heavy nuclei (U, Pu) and fission products (Cs, Nd). The decay heat was predicted using a calculation scheme based on the PEPIN2 depletion code, the TRIPOLI-4 Monte Carlo code, and the JEFF3.1.1 nuclear data file. The MERCI experiment analysis shows that the discrepancy between the calculated and the experimental decay heat values is included between -10% at 27 min and +6% at 12 h, 30 min otter shutdown. From 4 up to 42 days of cooling time, the difference between calculation and measurement is about +/- 1%, i.e., experimental uncertainty. The MERCI experiment represents a significant contribution for code validation; the time range above 10(5) s has not been validated previously.	[Jaboulay, J.

J	Perko, Z; Kloosterman, JL; Feher, S				Perko, Zoltan; Kloosterman, Jan Leen; Feher, Sandor			MINOR ACTINIDE TRANSMUTATION IN GFR600	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						transmutation; gas-cooled fast reactor; nonuniform minor actinide content		Within the Generation IV initiative, the gas-cooled fast reactor (GFR) is one of the reactors dedicated to minor actinide (MA) transmutation. This paper summarizes the research performed with the GFR600 reference design in order to assess its MA burning capabilities. For the study, modules of the SCALE program system were used. Single-cycle parametric studies were performed with cores having different MA content and spatial distribution. It was shown that the addition of MAs to the fuel greatly reduced the reactivity loss during burnup. Moreover, the higher the MA content of the core, the higher the fraction of it that was fissioned; however, the more the delayed neutron fraction and the fuel temperature coefficient degraded. Significant reduction can be achieved in the amounts of neptunium and americium, while curium isotopes accumulate. The study of multiple consecutive cycles showed that by adding only depleted uranium (DU) to the reprocessed actinides in fuel fabrication (pure DU feed strategy), up to 70% of the initially loaded MAs can be fissioned in the first five cycles. Moreover, the reactor can he made critical during that time if the initial MA content is higher than 3%. By feeding MAs as well (constant MA content strategy), the reactivity has a steady increase from cycle to cycle, predominantly due to Pu-238 breeding from Np-237. The effects of the isotopic composition of the plutonium and MAs were also examined by performing calculations with data specific to the spent fuel of traditional western pressure water reactors and Russian type VVER440 reactors. Despite the considerably different MA vectors, no significant deviation was found in their overall transmutation. However, the Pu composition had a strong effect on the reactivity and the delayed neutron fraction in the first cycles. Finally, cores having nonuniform MA content were investigated. It was found that though the MA destruction efficiency was significantly higher in the middle of the core than at the edge, moving some of the MAs from the outer regions to the center resulted in only minor improvement in their destruction. However, the spectral changes caused by the rearrangement increased the k-effective, which allowed higher burn ups and increased MA destruction. Unfortunately, some of the safety parameters of the reactor degraded.

PRELIMINARY RADIOLOGICAL SAFETY ASSESSMENT FOR DECOMMISSIONING OF THORIA DISSOLVER OF THE U-233 PILOT PLANT, TROMBAY	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								The thoria dissolver, used for separation of U-233 from reactor-irradiated thorium metal and thorium oxide rods, is no longer operational. It was decided to carry out assessment of the radiological status of the dissolver cell for planning of the future decommissioning/dismantling operations. The dissolver interiors are expected to be contaminated with the dissolution remains of irradiated thorium oxide rods in addition to some of the partially dissolved thoria pellets. Hence, Rn-220, a daughter product of Th-228 is of major radiological concern. Airborne activity of thoron daughters Pb-212 (Th-B) and Bi-212 (Th-C) was estimated by air sampling followed by high-resolution gamma spectrometry of filter papers. By measuring the full-energy peaks counts in the energy windows of Pb-212, Bi-212 and Tl-208, concentrations of thoron progeny in the sampled air were estimated by applying the respective intrinsic peak efficiency factors and suitable correction factors for the equilibration effects of Pb-212 and Bi-212 in the filter paper during the delay between sampling and counting. Then the thoron working level (TWL) was evaluated using the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) methodology. Finally, the potential effective dose to the workers, due to inhalation of thoron and its progeny during dismantling operations was assessed by using dose conversion factors recommended by ICRP. Analysis of filter papers showed a maximum airborne thoron progeny concentration of 30 TWLs inside the dissolver.	[Priya, S.; Srinivasan, P.; Gopalakrishnan, R.

The energy spectra of gamma rays emitted from the heads of two accelerator models, EXL-15SP and Clinac iX, after 10-MeV X-ray irradiation, were measured using a high-purity germanium semiconductor survey meter. After spectrum analyses, activities of Na-24, Al-28, Mn-54, Mn-56, Ni-57, Co-58, Co-60, Cu-64, Zn-65, Sb-122, Sb-124, W-181, W-187, Au-196, and Au-198 were detected. One centimetre deep dose-equivalent rate of the heads of the linear accelerator was measured using the survey meter. The dose rate decreased to similar to 10 % of its initial rate after 1 week. Longterm activations were few, the radioactivity level was low, and a cooling time of several days was effective for reducing dose rate to an acceptable level for decommissioning.

STUDY OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF Ra-226 IN GROUND WATER NEAR THE URANIUM INDUSTRY OF JHARKHAND, INDIA	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							RADIATION-EXPOSURE	Ground water is the principal source of drinking water in the rural areas of India. With the aim of determining, the contribution of Ra-226 to natural background radiation through drinking water exposure pathway near an operating uranium mining industry at Jaduguda, Jharkhand state of eastern India, the Ra-226 activity concentrations were measured in potable ground water. The water analysed, both tube well and well water, was collected in areas near the uranium industry and away. The Ra-226 concentration was measured by emanometric technique. The Ra-226 level in ground water was ranging between minimum detection limit of 3.5 mBq l(-1) and a maximum of 208 mBq l(-1). The analysis of variance reveals that there is insignificant statistical variation in the median Ra-226 concentration up to a distance of >10 km from the mining complex. Variation in concentration of Ra-226 in sources is attributed to the local geochemistry and environmental factors. The Ra-226 concentration was significantly elevated in natural artesian wells in the vicinity of uranium mineralised hill and it varies from 53.4 to 754 mBq l(-1). The WHO [Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality. Third Edition, Vol. 1, Recommendation (2004)] guideline value of 1000 mBq l(-1) has not been exceeded in any of the sources investigated.	[Tripathi, R.

The mean activity concentrations of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 in soil were found to be 40.3 +/- 3.5, 59.6 +/- 3.1 and 751.2 +/- 12.4 Bq kg(-1), respectively, which are all higher than the corresponding average values in Shaanxi, Chinese and world soil. The radium equivalent activity (Ra-eq), the air absorbed dose rate (D), the annual effective dose (E), the external hazard index (H-ex) and internal hazard index (H-in) were evaluated and compared with the internationally reported or reference values. All the soil samples have Ra-eq lower than the limit of 370 Bq kg(-1) and H-ex and H-in less than unity. The overall mean outdoor terrestrial gamma air absorbed dose rate is similar to 86.6 +/- 3.4 nGy h(-1) and the corresponding outdoor annual effective dose is 0.106 +/- 0.004 mSv, which is higher than the worldwide average (0.07 mSv y(-1)) for outdoor's annual effective dose.

Natural radionuclide activity concentrations in soil samples were determined using high-resolution gamma spectroscopy. Outdoor gamma dose measurements in air at 1 m above ground level were determined using a portable gamma scintillation detector. The obtained results of uranium and thorium series as well as potassium (K-40) are discussed. The present data were compared with the data obtained from different areas in Turkey. From the measured gamma-ray spectra, the average activity concentrations were determined for U-238 (range from 3.91 to 794.25 Bq kg(-1)), Th-232 (range from 0.68 to 245.55 Bq kg(-1)) and K-40 (range from 23.68 to 2718.71 Bq kg(-1)). The average activity concentrations of U-238, Th-232 and K-40 were found to be 35.51, 37.27 and 429.66 Bq kg(-1), respectively, and 11.53 Bq kg(-1) for the fission product Cs-137. The highest values of U-238, Th-232 and K-40 concentrations (794.25 Bq kg(-1), 245.55 Bq kg(-1), 2718.71 Bq kg(-1), respectively) were observed in abnormal samples at Hayriye village. The average outdoor gamma dose rate in air at 1 m above the ground was determined as 114.43 nGy h(-1). Using the data obtained in this study, the average annual effective dose for a person living in Kayseri was found to be about 140.34 mu Sv.

PREPARATION AND APPLICATION OF TEA TO A TRITIUM PERFORMANCE TESTING PROGRAMME	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							URINE	A simple, but novel technique, for adjusting steeps of black tea to produce fluids, which are visually and spectroscopically similar to urine, has been developed at the National Calibration Reference Centre for Bioassay and In Vivo Monitoring in Canada. The method uses scans of absorbance versus wavelength, in the UV-VIS range (200-800 nm) to select diluted tea steeps that simulate urine. Tea solutions (1 and 10 %) were spiked with tritium and distributed to laboratories for performance testing (PT). The PT exercise was done as in a regular bioassay programme. The results showed that all samples satisfied the pass/fail conditions of the S-106 standard of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, suggesting that adjusted tea successfully simulated urine for the tritium PT programmes. Also, since unlike urine whose use may increase the probability of contaminating and transmitting diseases (e.g. hepatitis C), tea is a safer alternative. When needed, it can readily be prepared for the laboratories.

Radon concentration in a nuclear facility locates in the granite tunnel can be as high as 104 Bq m(-3) in summer. Monitoring plutonium aerosol in this circumstance is seriously interfered by radon daughters. In order to solve this problem, a new continuous aerosol monitor that can monitor very low plutonium aerosol concentration in high radon background was developed. Several techniques were used to reduce interference of radon daughters, and the minimum detectable concentrations in various radon concentrations were measured.

The selected phosphate fertilisers samples were collected from two types of fertilisers NPK (N, nitrogen; P, phosphorus; K, potassium) and NPKs (sulphate-based NPK). These last ones are used to fertilise the studied area as well as a radioactivity comparison between the soils before and after fertilisation. NPK and NPKs fertilisers have presented higher concentrations of the radionuclide U-238, up to 1125 and 1545 Bq kg(-1), respectively. For soils before and after fertilisation, the concentrations of U-238 were, respectively, 252.8 and 316.2 Bq kg(-1). The average value and range of measured concentration of U-235 for soils before fertilisation was 12.16 +/- 1.4 Bq kg(-1) and for the fertilised soils was 15.16 +/- 1.8 Bq kg(-1), whereas the corresponding values for NPK and NPKs fertilisers were, respectively, 49.38 +/- 5.7 and 50.61 +/- 5.2 Bq kg(-1).
