J	Paziorek, P				Paziorek, P			A view of framework conditions in energy and nuclear power policies in 2003	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								Important issues associated with the use of nuclear power are on the agenda of energy policy to be discussed also in the 15th parliamentary term. Here are some of the questions to be answered: Which source of energy is to fill the gap left by opting out of the use of nuclear power? Under these conditions, how are the obligations under the Kyoto Protocol to be met? How is the problem of final storage of radioactive waste to be solved? On a medium and long term, important framework conditions for electricity supply must be created as the widening gap in supply as a result of opting out of the use of nuclear power cannot be bridged solely by saving energy and by renewable energy sources. If the obligations incurred in the Kyoto Protocol are to be met at the same time, this also includes advanced development work on the use of fossil sources of energy. As far as the final storage of radioactive waste is concerned, the procedures initiated appear to delay a solution. Again, a concept and early decisions are needed. On the whole, politics will be called upon in the very near future to develop a workable, balanced energy concept taking into account climate protection and continuity of supply, and to take a clear decision in selecting a repository site.

The strategies will provide mankind with long-term and sufficient maintenance energy supplies. In the following article, results of calculations for a period from 2 000 through 2 500 are submitted taking into account environmental restrictions. The strategies assume the competitive use of primary power resources coal, natural gas, petroleum, hydro resources, uranium and plutonium in nuclear power and solar energy. The limits of maximum fast use of known and prospective world reserves (deposits) of primary resources, such as coal, natural gas, and petroleum are being considered. The place and the aggregated structure of nuclear power, making it competitive among the cited (enumerated) power resources is determined. The forecast for the price of electricity charges for the next 500 years is given. The calculations have been carried out according to an optimized power model of super size range, which is a component of TOBAS computerized complex of optimized programs.

The PBMR is the most advanced project in the development of 4th-generation high temperature reactors. The basic concept provides forthe construction of units of approx. 165 MW power each, which can be combined into aggregate systems of two, four or eight units. This allows the generating power to be matched to requirements, and individual units to make joint use of common infrastructure systems. The basic technical concept of the PBMR includes a pressure vessel made of steel with a graphite liner and spherical fuel elements containing the fuel as coated particles. The coolant is helium. The plant concept guarantees maximum safety as there is no risk of major radioactivity volumes being released. An important step in PBMR development are the commissioning and first successful experiments of a test rig for the planned cooling circuit for the turbine direct helium cycle, with accompanying thermodynamic analyses, at the Faculty of Engineering of the Potchefstroom University, South Africa.

J	Miller, RL				Miller, RL		ARIES Team	ARIES-ST design point selection	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						magnetic fusion; spherical totamak (ST); spherical torus; neutral beam current; drive; bootstrap current contribution; power plant	SPHERICAL TOKAMAK; FUSION POWER; PLANT	The spherical tokamak (ST) regime of low-aspect-ratio (LAR) tokamak operation has provided an opportunity to consider a 1000-MWe(net) D-T power plant conceptual design, designated ARIES-ST. Physics attributes include high beta ( similar to 50%) together with high bootstrap current contribution ( similar to 95%). Neutral-beam current drive ( similar to 28 MW) supports steady-state operation. The plasma aspect ratio was selected to be A similar or equal to 1.6 leading to the choice of major plasma toroidal radius, R-T = 3.2 m and plasma half-width, a = 2.0 m. The usual engineering considerations of providing an efficient thermal power cycle (gross efficiency similar or equal to45%), while handling first-wall ( similar to 1 MW/m(2)) and divertor-plate (similar to 5 MW/m(2)) surface heat fluxes, leads to 14-MeV neutron wall loads near 4.1 MW/m(2) (average) and 5.6 MW/m(2) (peak at outboard mid-plane) in a dual (PbLi and He) coolant system. The water-cooled toroidal-field-coil (TFC) centerpost is protected by a 20-cm (inboard) shield that does not breed tritium. Joule dissipation in the TFC system provides the major contribution to the plant recirculating power; specifically, Cu centerpost (222 MW), Al outboard shell (47 MW), Cu leads (27 MW), and power supplies (33 MW). The overall plant recirculating power fraction is an uncomfortable 34%. For a plant capacity factor similar to 76%, consistent with earlier ARIES studies, the COE is projected to be similar to 84 mill/kWe h (1992 constant $), using similar unit-cost assumptions and some passive-safety cost credits. Inclusion of additional credits for advanced, low-unit-cost manufacturing based on plasma spray and related techniques (as applied to the TFC centerpost and outboard TFC shell only) lowers this COE estimate to similar to 79 mill/kWe h.

J	El-Guebaly, LA				El-Guebaly, LA		ARIES Team	ARIES-ST nuclear analysis and shield design	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						ARIES-ST; nuclear analysis; shield design	POWER-PLANTS; NEUTRONICS	A power plant design based on the spherical torus (ST) concept has been developed by the ARIES team. This paper documents the results of the nuclear and radiation protection analyses carried out for the ARIES-ST design. The nuclear analysis addresses the key neutronics issues, such as the neutron wall loading profile, radiation damage to structural components and their lifetimes, tritium breeding ratio (TBR), and nuclear heat loads to in-vessel components. The main theme of the shielding analysis is to develop guidance and recommendations on radiation protection for the TF magnet, in particular, the center-post. The need for an inboard shield, the selection of an optimal shield, the rationale for the shielding material choices, and the consequences of the shielding material choices on the overall design are reported herein. During the course of the ARIES-ST study, the design has been analyzed rigorously with a set of 3-D nuclear analyses to guide the developing design. The results of the assessment had a major impact on the design choices. For instance, the insufficient breeding along with other design constraints have ruled out the use of several attractive solid breeder blankets, the excessive neutron damage to the center-post provided strong incentives to shield the center-post, and the high radiation damage to the plasma facing components has limited the service lifetime of the ferritic steel (FS) structure to a few full power years. Furthermore, the high heat load to the inboard shield (400 MW, 10% of thermal power) forced the design to recover the inboard heating as high-grade heat to enhance the power balance. Also, the sensitivity of the outboard-only LiPb breeding blanket to the inboard shielding materials has limited the shielding options and excluded several high performance inboard-shielding materials. The performed analyses and results are reported and discussed in relation to the integrated design and the established top-level requirements for the ARIES power plants.

J	Khater, HY; Mogahed, EA; Sze, DK; Tillack, MS; Wang, XR				Khater, HY; Mogahed, EA; Sze, DK; Tillack, MS; Wang, XR		ARIES Team	ARIES-ST safety design and analysis	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							FUSION	Activation and safety analyses were performed for the ARIES-ST design. The ARIES-ST power plant includes a water-cooled copper centerpost. The first wall and shield are made of low activation ferritic steel and cooled with helium. The blanket is also made of ferritic steel with SiC inserts and Li17Pb83 breeder. The divertor plate is made of low activation ferritic steel and uses a tungsten brush as plasma facing component. The power plant has a lifetime of 40 full power years (FPY). However, the centerpost, first wall, inboard shield and blanket were assumed to be replaced every 2.86 FPY. Neutron transmutation of copper resulted in the production of several nickel, cobalt and zinc isotopes. The production of these isotopes resulted in an increase of the time-space average electrical resistivity of the centerpost by about 6% after 2.86 FPY: All of the plant components met the limits for disposal as Class C low-level waste. The off-site doses produced at, the onset of an accident are caused by the mobilization of the radioactive inventory present in the plant. Analysis of a loss of coolant accident (LOCA) indicated that the centerpost would reach a maximum temperature of about 1000 degreesC during the accident. In the meantime, the first wall and shield would reach a maximum temperature of about 800 degreesC. A similar divertor LOCA analysis indicated that the front tungsten layer would also reach a maximum temperature of about 800 degreesC. The calculated temperature profiles and available oxidation-driven volatility experimental data were used to calculate the dose at the site boundary under conservative release conditions. The current design produces an effective whole body early dose of 1.88 mSv at the site boundary. In addition, a divertor disruption would only produce an effective whole body early dose of 7.68 muSv at the site boundary. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The impacts were assessed both for operational and post-operational (future unrestricted use of the area) scenarios. The work methodology encompassed sampling and analysis of different materials along the operational process, including wastes, effluents and by-products, mass balance calculations, and dose assessment. The exposure scenario considered during the operational phase included the land use by hypothetical groups of members of the general public. In the case of post-operational phase the possible occupation of contaminated areas was considered. The results pointed out that during the operational phase of the investigated industries no relevant impacts could be attributed to them. However, in the case of the potential occupation of the contaminated areas where the wastes are being deposited, the unrestricted use of these areas cannot be accepted in terms of the relevant radiation protection requirements.

We analyzed the only existing physical remains of the black rain from Hiroshima A-bomb (Little Boy), a plastered wall with black streaks. Excess Cs-137 and anomalous U-235/U-238 ratios detected in the black residues on the wall confirmed that the black streaks on the wall originated from Little Boy. The results also showed that excess U-235 could be used as a fingerprint to clarify the distribution of materials discharged from Little Boy into the environment. High concentrations of lead and zinc, which may have caused a degree of heavy metal pollution in the area where the rain fell, were also detected in the black rain sample.

Tooth eruption and development are ongoing processes that begin during fetal development and continue until the age of 18 y. Since one of the mechanisms involved in tooth eruption is bone formation and it is well documented that uranium inhibits bone formation, the aim of the present work was to study the effect of oral administration of uranyl nitrate (UN) on tooth eruption and development. Wistar rats aged 1 and 7 d were orally administered a single dose of 90 mg kg(-1) body weight of uranyl nitrate. Two age matched groups received an equal volume of saline and served as controls. The animals were killed at 7 and 14 d of age, respectively. Mandibles were resected and processed to obtain bucco-lingual sections oriented at the level of the mesial root of the first mandibular molar, and histomorphometric studies were performed. Results showed that an acute high dose of uranyl nitrate delays both tooth eruption and development, probably due to its effect on target cells.

J	Marianno, CM; Higley, KA; Moss, SC; Palmer, TS				Marianno, CM; Higley, KA; Moss, SC; Palmer, TS			An experimental determination of fidler scanning efficiency at specific speeds	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						scanning; plutonium; instrumentation; detector, radiation		As part of mass remediation efforts across the country some radiation detection systems are now being used in conjunction with data logging and positioning system technology. These systems can be used in the scanning mode, simultaneously recording both count rate and position. Following data analysis, hot spots can be identified and remediation efforts for that particular area can commence. This technique has been used for nearly a decade and has had success in accelerating preliminary remediation work while also reducing potential clean up costs. However, little work has been completed on how the sensitivity of these detection systems are affected when used with this technology because while the intrinsic efficiency of the detector is constant, scanning efficiency can vary depending on data sampling time and scanning speed. To better understand scanning efficiency for a detector attached to such a system, a device was developed which moved soil at a constant speed underneath a Field Instrument for Detecting Low Energy Radiation (FI-DLER). Count rate was measured every 2 s as a Am-241 source passed under the detector at speeds ranging from similar to10 cm s(-1) to 100 cm s(-1). A surface source and a buried source were both examined. Experimental detection efficiency was calculated and compared to Monte Carlo generated results. For the surface source, the efficiency dropped to a value of approximately 1% at 100 cm s(-1). At the same speed, the buried source had a detection efficiency of 0.1%, primarily due to attenuation of the low energy photon in the soil. It was also noted that the response time of the meter Affected the scanning efficiency. With a response time set at 1 s, higher average efficiencies were recorded but with a large standard deviation from the mean. Higher response time setting had the effect of reducing the variability of the reading but also reducing efficiency.

A carborne 3- by 3-inch NaI(TI) spectrometric system was used with an un-shielded 2 GBq Cs-137 source as a test source. In this paper, a previous method (MB method), based on a moving average algorithm applied on the gross count rate, wits extended and compared with three moving average algorithm methods involving different natural background subtraction strategies. For each method the distance from the road that an orphan source can be detected with a probability of 50% (the critical distance, CD) when driving by is determined. The CD for a 2 GBq Cs-137 source improved from 105 m to 1.30 m when the interference from K-40 was subtracted from the Cs-137 spectral window. However, when the contribution of other natural gamma-emitting nuclides also was subtracted, the ability to find the Cs-137 source was reduced.

J	Stigum, H; Strand, T; Magnus, P				Stigum, H; Strand, T; Magnus, P			Should radon be reduced in homes? A cost-effect analysis	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						radon; lungs, human; cancer; analysis, cost-benefit	LUNG-CANCER; RESIDENTIAL RADON; EXPOSURE; RISK; HEALTH; RECOMMENDATIONS; MEDICINE; MODELS; SWEDEN	Background: Radon is a radioactive gas that may leak into buildings from the ground. Radon exposure is a risk factor for lung cancer. An intervention against radon exposure in homes may consist of locating homes with high radon exposure (above 200 Bq m(-3)) and improving these, and protecting future houses. The purpose of this paper is to calculate the costs and the effects of this intervention. Methods: We performed a cost-effect analysis from the perspective of the society, followed by an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. The distribution of radon levels in Norwegian homes is lognormal with mean = 74.5 Bq m(-3), and 7.6% above 200 Bq m(-3). Results: The preventable attributable fraction of radon on lung cancer was 3.8% (95% uncertainty interval: 0.6%, 8.3%). In cumulative present values the intervention would cost $238 (145, 310) million and save 892 (133, 1981) lives; each life saved costs $0.27 (0.09, 0.9) million. The cost-effect ratio was sensitive to the radon risk, the radon exposure distribution, and the latency period of lung cancer. Together these three parameters explained 90% of the variation in the cost-effect ratio. Conclusions: The uncertainty in the estimated cost per life is large, mainly due to uncertainty in the risk of lung cancer from radon. Based on estimates from road construction, the Norwegian society has been willing to pay $1 million to save a life. This is above the upper uncertainty limit of the cost per life.

The results are from test pits of 1-2 m depth made at a dam of a tailings pond and at the plateau of a waste rock pile. Soil samples of about 1 kg were taken at a successive distances of 5 cm and analyzed by means of gamma-ray spectroscopy using low background germanium n-type detectors. It is shown that by this method nearly model independent information about the radon transport over a period of several decades can be inferred from the data.

J	Armstrong, JA				Armstrong, JA			Hanford single-pass reactor fuel storage basin demolition	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topic; nuclear fuel cycle; contamination; radiation protection		The Environmental Restoration Contractor at the Hanford Site is tasked with removing auxiliary reactor structures and leaving the remaining concrete structure surrounding each reactor core. This is referred to as Interim Safe Storage. Part of placing the F Reactor into Interim Safe Storage is the demolition of the fuel storage basin, which was deactivated in 1970 by placing debris material into the basin prior to back filling with soil. Besides the debris material (wooden floor decking, handrails, and monorail pieces), the fuel storage basin contents included the possibility of spent nuclear fuel, fuel buckets, fuel spacers, process tubes, and tongs. Demolition of the fuel storage basin offered many unique radiological control challenges and innovative approaches to demolition. This paper describes how the total effective dose equivalent and contamination were controlled, how the use of a remote operated excavator was employed to remove high-dose-rate material, and how wireless technology was used to monitor changing radiological conditions.

For that reason, a careful cost-benefit analysis must be performed weighing the cost of decontaminating and radiologically surveying the building media for release against the cost of disposing of the material as radioactive waste. This cost-benefit analysis visibly came into play at the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site during the recent D&D of two facilities.			jeff.barroso@rfets.gov						0	3	3	0	0	LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS	PHILADELPHIA	530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA	0017-9078	1538-5159		HEALTH PHYS	Health Phys.

J	Borst, T				Borst, T			Fort St. Vrain - A DOE success story	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topic; decontamination; nuclear power plant; nuclear fuel cycle		The Fort St. Vrain Nuclear Generating Station was a one-of-its-kind High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor located near Denver, CO. Due to operational difficulties, the reactor was permanently shut down in August 1989. Plans to ship the spent reactor fuel to Idaho were thwarted by the Governor of Idaho. The inability to ship the spent reactor fuel offsite necessitated the construction of an Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) in order to proceed with the decommissioning of the reactor. After loading the ISFSI, decommissioning of the reactor was initiated and successfully completed. At the same time, the site was repowered using natural gas. As part of a settlement with the owner of the reactor, the U.S. Department of Energy agreed to take title to the spent fuel in the ISFSI and obtain an NRC license for the facility. The license for the ISFSI was transferred to the DOE in June 1999. Day-to-day operations of the ISFSI are accomplished by the DOE's Maintenance and Operations contractor, Bechtel Babcock Wilcox Idaho (BBWI). BBWI also operates the Three Mile Island Unit 2 ISFSI in Idaho for the DOE. This paradigm for ISFSI operations has been highly successful and is expandable to additional ISFSIs that may come tinder the jurisdiction of the DOE.

Large structures, such as former plutonium production reactors and separations facilities, are thoroughly and comprehensively characterized, not only for decontamination and decommissioning (D&D), but also for disposal and/or release. The ACS uses gamma-ray imaging instruments, in situ gamma spectrometry and large-area data-logging contamination survey meters to generate sufficient quality data to make operational and release decisions. The system is also used to safely characterize in place systems without violating any containment and to localize activity in unusual situations.

J	Funke, KC				Funke, KC			Effective radiological contamination control and monitoring techniques in high alpha environments	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topic; alpha particles; contamination; air sampling		In the decommissioning of a highly contaminated alpha environment, such as the one at Hanford's 233-S Plutonium Concentration Facility, one of the key elements of a successful radiological control program is an integrated safety approach. This approach begins with the job-planning phase where tire scope of the work is described. This is followed by a brainstorming session involving engineering and craft to identify how to perform the work in a. logical sequence of events. Once the brainstorming session is over, a Job Hazard Analysis is performed to identify any potential problems. Mockups are utilized to enable the craft to get hands on experience and provide feedback and ideas to make the job run smoother. Ideas and experience gained during mockups are incorporated into the task instruction. To assure appropriate data are used in planning and executing the job, our principal evaluation tools included lapel and workplace air sampling, plus continuous air monitors and frequent surveys to effectively monitor job progress. In this highly contaminated alpha environment, with contamination levels ranging from 0.3 Bq cm(-2) to similar to100,000 Bq cm(-2) (2,000 dpm per 100 cm(2) to similar to600 million dpm per 100 cm2), with average working levels of 1,600-3,200 Bq cm(-2) (10-20 million dpm per 100 cm2) without concomitant ambient radiation levels, control of the spread of contamination is key to keeping airborne levels As Low As Reasonably Achievable.

J	Hoffman, DE				Hoffman, DE			Worker and environmental protection issues in the remediation of an abandoned source manufacturing facility	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topic; radioactive materials; contamination; waste disposal		The Gulf Nuclear Superfund Site located in Odessa, Texas, was an abandoned radioactive source production facility slated for cleanup as a Removal Action under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region VI Superfund program. Prior to cessation of operations and abandonment of the facility in 1992, it was used for the production of radioactive sources used in the oil and gas industry and nuclear medicine applications. Pangea Group was contracted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Kansas City District to perform remediation of the site and other contaminated debris, cleaning of interior building surfaces, building demolition, and excavation/removal of contaminated soils and septic system. The project scope also included loading, containerization and transportation of low-level radioactive wastes for offsite disposal. Primary radionuclides present at the facility were Cs-137, Co-60, and Am-241. The project also included packaging and removal of radioactive sources and mixed waste consisting of radiologically contaminated lead shot and lead source containers. Included in the paper is a discussion of primary worker protection and environmental protection measures employed on the project. Worker protection issues included the control of industrial and construction safety hazards as well as control of external and internal radiation dose. Control of air emissions and contaminated wastewater were also very important, especially due to the location of the site. The site was located in an area containing both residential and commercial properties. Several residences and businesses were located immediately adjacent to the site. The project involved the participation of the US-ACE Kansas City District, EPA Region 6, and the Texas Bureau of Radiological Health. Field work on the project started in April 2001 and was completed approximately five months later.

Two liquid waste disposal sites, essentially large trenches designed to filter contaminants from the water as it percolates through the soil column, were established to dispose of the effluent. The discharges to the sites included cooling. water from the reactor-primary, spent fuel storage, and periphery systems, along with miscellaneous drainage from reactor support facilities. Today, both sites are classified as Treatment Storage and Disposal Facilities tinder the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976; which makes them priority sites for remediation. The two sites cover approximately 4,100 m(2) and 9,300 m(2), respectively. Remediation of the sites requires removing a combined total of approximately 2.6 x 10(8) kg of contaminated soil and debris. Principal radionuclides contained in the soil/debris are Co-60, Cs-137, Pu-239, and Sr-90. Remediation of these waste sites requires demolishing concrete structures and excavating, hauling, and:disposing of contaminated soils in work areas containing high levels of contamination and whole body dose rates in excess of 1 mSv h(-1). The work presents unique radiological control challenges, such as minimizing external dose to workers in a constantly changing outdoor work environment, maintaining-contamination control during removal of a water distribution trough filled with highly contaminated sludge, and minimizing outdoor airborne contamination during size reduction of highly contaminated pipelines. Through innovative approaches to dose reduction and contamination control, Hanford's Environmental Restoration Contractor has met the challenge, completing the first phase on schedule and with a total project exposure below the goal of 0.1 person-Sv.

Energy resolutions were 11% for 511 keV photons, 20% for 140 keV(Tc-99m) photons and 28% for 70 keV(Tl-201) photons, enabling the use of this system in SPECT studies. The paired assembly of crystals provided an absolute sensitivity of approximately 7% for PET tracers and 70% for Tc-99m and Tl-201 (SPECT tracers). Multiple arrangement of paired detectors would make it possible to correct for the transit time of radioactivity through the catheter tube. This study demonstrates that the present system can be of use in both clinical and small animal studies using SPECT and PET tracers.

The detector heads of the SPECT sub-system are designed to be capable of imaging the gamma- and X-ray emissions (28-35 keV) of the radioactive isotope iodine-125 (I-125). Two different sets of I-125 imaging detectors are configured on a gantry that has an open-barrel type design. One set of detector heads is based on the 1-in square Hamamatsu R5900-M64 position sensitive photomultiplier tube coupled to crystal scintillator arrays. The other detector heads configured on the gantry are two 5-in diameter Hamamatsu R3292-based compact gamma cameras. The X-ray radiographic projections are obtained using a LIXI Inc. model LF-85-503-OS X-ray imaging system that has an active area of 5.5 cm in diameter.

The chamber has a mini-strip plate made of glass substrate with metal strips deposited along two perpendicular directions. Here, we report on a version of this chamber with an additional grid, improved trigger capability and the development of the multichannel readout system based on highly integrated low-noise front-end electronics and dedicated data acquisition system. The average root mean square (rms) noise between 250 and 350 electrons has been achieved with the front-end electronics operated at the temperature of -100degreesC.

J	Busker, G; Grimes, RW; Bradford, MR				Busker, G; Grimes, RW; Bradford, MR			The solution and diffusion of ruthenium in UO2 +/- x	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							FISSION-PRODUCT RELEASE; NUCLEAR-FUEL; OXIDATION; EMISSION	Atomic scale computer simulation is used to develop models that describe the behaviour of ruthenium in the uranium dioxide lattice. Results are consistent with observed metal particle formation in UO2-x and UO2. Conversely it is predicted that ruthenium can be soluble in UO2+x although in irradiated fuel the extent of ruthenium solution will depend on the total concentration of fission products compared to the oxygen interstitial ion concentration. Second phase oxide particles such as BaRuO3 and RuO2 are not predicted to be stable. At all stoichiometries activation energies for migration are high. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The effects of dopants of CaO and Nb2O5 on shrinkage of the oxides of the above Pu/(Pu + Th) ratios were also studied. Out of the two dopants studied, CaO was found to give larger shrinkage for all the Pu/(Pu + Th) ratios covered in this study. It was also found that the shrinkage was marginally larger in Ar-8%H-2 than in Ar atmosphere. Addition Of PuO2 to ThO2 enhanced sintering. This was found to be true for both the dopants. During the sintering of ThO2, a prominent peak was observed in the shrinkage curve at around 100-300degreesC. This peak was attributed to the pressure increase of the trapped gases which subsequently release at high temperatures. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The fuels used in the experiments, the plutonium content of which was 30 wt%, were irradiated up to 65 GWd/t in the experimental fast reactor JOYO. The experiments consisted of two runs, FP-1 and FP-2. In FP-1, the fuel sample was first heated to 2,000degreesC and then up to 3,000degreesC. The holding time was 30 min at each temperature. In FP-2, the terminal temperatures were 1,500degreesC and 2,500degreesC, and the holding time was 30 min in the same manner. The release of Cs, a volatile FP, was detected as soon as the fuel sample was heated up. The release rate, after peaking in several minutes, decreased gradually via a diffusion process in the fuel matrix. The "gross" diffusion coefficient agreed well with the data reported in other experiments using LWR fuels. The release fractions were identical in both experiments, namely Cs similar to 100%, Sb similar to 100%, Ru similar to 10%, Ce similar to0% and Eu similar to0%.

J	Kuriene, L; Clemente, M; Langenbuch, S				Kuriene, L; Clemente, M; Langenbuch, S			Study of the void reactivity behaviour of RBMK reactors	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article								The RBMK is a graphite moderated boiling water reactor Of channel type. The reactivity behaviour of this reactor is important for safety aspects. The fuel arrangement in pressure tubes together with graphite as moderator may lead to a high positive void reactivity coefficient. To reduce the positive reactivity effect the core design was modified by adding absorbing materials as fixed additional absorbers, increasing the fuel enrichment or ensuring that a prescribed number of control rod absorbers are inserted during operation. Additionally new loading strategies were developed, using fuel with the burnable absorber erbium. The measures implemented reduced the void effect to values below one beta. The void reactivity is also dependent on the core composition and the burnup. Different non-fuel core components affect the void reactivity, partly with influences in opposite directions. The void reactivity behaviour as a function of coolant density was investigated for different RBMK plants and operational states by using the 3D core model QUABOX/ CUBBOX It was found that the void reactivity function can have a significant non-linear dependence on the coolant density, influencing the magnitude of the measured void coefficient.

Application of the reactor would permit the continued growth of plutonium to cease and the stocks of depleted uranium already mined mould sustain a large feet of such reactors indefinitely. The GCFR has high potential for the incineration of the ultra-long-term heavy metal waste arising from fuel processing. Recently, a British-Japanese industrial assessment concluded that the concept shores promise of competing on economic terms with the light-water reactor.

J	Park, WS; Song, TY; Lee, BO; Park, CK				Park, WS; Song, TY; Lee, BO; Park, CK			A preliminary design study for the HYPER system	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								In order to transmute the long-lived radioactive nuclides such as transuranics (TRU), Tc-99, and I-129 in LWR spent fuel, a preliminary conceptual design study has been performed for an accelerator driven subcritical reactor system, called HYPER (HYbrid Power Extraction Reactor). The core has a hybrid neutron energy spectrum which includes fast and thermal neutrons for the transmutation of TRU and fission products, respectively. TRU are loaded into the HYPER core in a TRU-Zr metal form because a metal type fuel has very good compatibility with the pyro-chemical process which retains the self-protection of transuranics at all times. On the other hand, Tc-99 and 1-129 are loaded as pure technetium metal and sodium iodide, respectively. Pb-Bi is chosen as a primary coolant because Pb-Bi can provide a good spallation target and produce a very hard neutron energy spectrum. As results, the HYPER system does not need any independent spallation target system. 9Cr-2WVTa is used as a window material because this advanced ferritic/martensitic steel is known to have a good performance in the highly corrosive and radiative environment. The support ratios of the HYPER system are about 4-5 for TRU, Tc-99, and 1-129. Therefore, a radiologically clean nuclear power, i.e. zero net production of TRU, Tc-99 and 1-129 can be achieved by combining 4-5 LWRs with one HYPER system. In addition, the HYPER system, having good proliferation resistance and high nuclear waste transmutation capability, is believed to provide a breakthrough to the spent fuel problems the nuclear industry is facing with.

The device was fabricated on monocrystalline material of size 2.7 x 2.7 x 1.0 mm(3). It has a pixel size of 350 x 350 mum(2) and pitch of 450 mum. Measurements were carried out on all pixels over the energy range 5.9-662 keV using radioactive sources. The leakage currents were found to be low enough to allow room-temperature operation, with typical energy resolutions of similar to20 keV FWHM at 59.95 keV under full-area illumination. At a reduced detector temperature of -30degreesC, these fell to similar to4keV FWHM. Although the spectral performance of the present array is currently impaired by material limitations, its spectral acuity was found to be greatly enhanced by the small pixel effect. Additional photon metrology was carried out at the Hamburger Synchrotron-strahlungslabor radiation facility. Under monochromatic pencil beam illumination, the measured energy resolutions at 20 keV were similar to3 keV FWHM at -30degreesC. The spatial uniformity of the array was measured using a 50 x 50 mum(2), 20 keV monoenergetic X-ray beam, raster scanned over the entire active area. The response, in terms of count rate, gain and energy resolution was found to be uniform at the few percent level, consistent with statistics. It was observed during these measurements, that the X-ray response of the pixels was unstable, showing time-dependent gain shifts indicative of polarization effects. The magnitude of the effect was proportional to the total energy deposition per unit time.

Associated to each technique, simple radiochemical procedures have been developed for the isolation of the radionuclides of interest and/or their adaption to the measurement conditions. These determinations are very useful in designing low-level gamma-spectrometric systems as well as in the interpretation, evaluation and even simulation of their background spectra.

The main contribution of this work is the demonstration of an easy-to-implement, low-cost detector-preamplifier set that can be built with an inexpensive PIN diode and a low-noise preamplifier of the charge-sensitive type. A junction field-effect transistors in the front end and extremely low feedback capacitance are used in the preamplifier. The set was built and characterized experimentally. High conversion gain and good linearity over the whole energy range were obtained; the set provides an acceptable equivalent noise charge, on the order of 120 electrons r.m.s. Spectra from different X-ray radioactive sources were obtained by using the PIN detector at room temperature together with the preamplifier that is described. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

A series of such experiments was performed at the Los Alamos Criticality Experiments Facility. These experiments were performed to provide criticality safety data for waste matrix materials. These critical experiments were fueled with highly enriched uranium, moderated and reflected with polyethylene, and mixed with silicon dioxide (SiO2), aluminum (Al), magnesium oxide (MgO), and gadolinium (Gd). The uncertainties affecting the experiment were divided into three broad categories: mass measurement, geometry, and material composition. Each category is considered in turn, and then the total experimental uncertainly is derived. All four experiments had a measured k(eff) of 1.001. The sensitivity analyses of these critical experiments yielded uncertainties in the measured keff of 0.0026 for SiO2, +/-0.0026 for Al, +/-0.0021 for MgO, and +/-0.0029 for Gd. These experiments were judged to be of benchmark quality.

These reaction models are computationally fast but are unreliable at energies below similar to200 MeV As a partial remedy, an evaluated cross-section library up to 150 MeV known as LA150 was developed by international cooperation and made available for such design work. In the present project we have been developing a model code suitable for improving LA 150 and extending it to higher energies. This new model code combines microscopically the semiclassical results of an intranuclear-cascade model with the spin-dependent counterparts of a preequilibrium Hauser-Feshbach model. To achieve this microscopic combination, an approximation, explained in this paper, is needed to add spin distributions to the semiclassical excitation spectra in every residual nuclide. The initial capability of this code is demonstrated by comparisons with experimental production cross sections of the radioisotopes Co-56, Co-55, Mn-54, Mn-52, Fe-52, Cr-51, Cr-48, V-48, Sc-47, Sc-46 and induced by proton projectiles on Fe from reaction thresholds to 3 GeV The overall agreement of our calculated results with experimental data looks very good in view of the 29 contributions in recent model code intercomparisons with measurements.

J	Clarno, KT; Hassan, YA				Clarno, KT; Hassan, YA			Development of a RELAP5-3D multidimensional model of a VVER-1000 NPIP for analysis of a large-break loss-of-coolant accident	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						VVER-1000 nuclear power plants; large-break loss-of-coolant accident; RELAP5-3D computer program		In order to analyze the benefits of the multidimensional hydrodynamic modeling capability of the RELAP5-3D system code for the VVER-1000 nuclear power plant (NPP), a three-dimensional (3-D) model of the core, downcomer, and lower plenum has been created to replace the NPP one-dimensional (1-D) counterparts in a complete plant model. This multidimensional model has been validated with plant operational data and other computer simulations of a thermal-hydraulic transient. The simulated transient considered was a large-break loss-of-coolant accident (LB LOCA). A validated, 1-D control model of the NPP, for the study of the effects of mixed oxide fuel, was modified to include a standard fuel loading Of UO2. The development of the 3-D sections of the reactor vessel consisted of ensuring geometrical fidelity with the design of the modeled plant, the Balakovo Unit 4 NPP in Saratov, Russia. A stable operational steady state was obtained and the calculated plant conditions compared well with the design values of the Balakovo plant. Transient results verified that the simulated thermal-hydraulic conditions of the multidimensional model agreed well with both the control and analyses that have been performed separately from this study. It was found that the multidimensional model has shown a reduction in the calculated hot-spot peak-clad temperature (PCT) during the blowdown stage of a LB LOCA and an increase in PCT during the reflood stage. A preliminary uncertainty analysis of the PCT during blowdown stage was performed using a response surface method of the Code Scaling, Applicability, and Uncertainty Method and a significant number of relevant input variables. From the preliminary analysis, the PCT reduction during blowdown appears to be significant, but a further, more detailed analysis should be performed, along with an uncertainty analysis of the PCT during the reflood stage. The enhanced depiction of the flow patterns and temperature distributions in the transient situation allowed the user further understanding of the thermal-hydraulic conditions throughout the transient. The developed model proved to be suitable for analysis of the VVER-1000 plant, but to further the applicability of the model, a 3-D kinetics model of the neutronics and 3-D hydro-dynamic models of the horizontal steam generators should be included.

J	Yasui, S; Amakawa, T				Yasui, S; Amakawa, T			Vaporization rate of cesium from molten slag in a plasma melting furnace for the treatment of simulated low-level radioactive wastes	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						plasma melting; low-level waste treatment; cesium vaporization	HEAT TREATMENT; FLY-ASH; EVAPORATION	The vaporization phenomena of cesium (Cs) from molten slag have been investigated in a plasma melting process for simulated radioactive waste materials. A direct current transfer-type plasma with a maximum output of 50 kW was used to melt carbon steel and granular oxide mixtures (Fe2O3, Al2O3, SiO2, CaO, and MgO) containing nonradioactive cesium nitrate, to measure Cs vaporization. These materials are the main components of low-level miscellaneous solid wastes. The vaporization rate of Cs from the molten slag during the plasma melting was observed and was compared with the vaporization rate obtained in an electric resistance furnace. The apparent vaporization rate of Cs was found to follow the first-order rate equation with respect to the molten slag's Cs content, and its rate constant values varied (3.5 to 21.0) x 10(-6) m/s varying with the chemical composition of the miscellaneous solid wastes. These rate constants were about one order larger than those obtained in the electric resistant furnace and also the diffusion coefficients of basic elements in the molten slag. These results suggest that the vaporization rate of Cs is controlled by the vaporization step from the free molten slag furnace to the gas phase and depends predominantly on the thermo-dynamic properties of the molten slag.

J	Ueki, K; Kawakami, K; Shimizu, D				Ueki, K; Kawakami, K; Shimizu, D			Using the Monte Carlo coupling technique to evaluate the shielding ability of a modular shielding house to accommodate spent-fuel transportable storage casks	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						shielding; Monte Carlo; dose	NEUTRON	The Monte Carlo coupling technique with the coordinate transformation is used to evalulate the shielding ability of a modular shielding house that accommodates four spent-fuel transportable storage casks for two units. The effective dose rate distributions can be obtained as far as 300 m from the center of the shielding house. The coupling technique is created with the Surface Source Write (SSW) card and the Surface Source Read/Coordinate Transformation (SSR/CRT) card in the MCNP 4C continuous energy Monte Carlo code as the "SSW-SSR/CRT calculation system." In the present Monte Carlo coupling calculation, the total effective dose rates 100, 200, and 300 m from the center of the shielding house are estimated to be 1.69, 0.285, and 0.0826 ( muSv/yr per four casks), respectively. Accordingly, if the distance between the center of the shielding house and the site boundary of the storage facility is kept at >300 m, approximately 2400 casks are able to be accommodated in the modular shielding houses, under the Japanese severe criterion of 50 muSv/yr at the site boundary. The shielding house alone satisfies not only the technical conditions but also the economic requirements. It became evident that secondary gamma rays account for >60% of the effective total dose rate at all the calculated points around the shielding house, most of which are produced from the water in the steel-water-steel shielding system of the shielding house. The remainder of the dose rate comes mostly from neutrons; the fission product and Co-60 activation gamma rays account for small percentages. Accordingly, reducing the secondary gamma rays is critical to improving not only the shielding ability but also the radiation safety of the shielding house.

J	Logar, M; Jeraj, R; Glumac, B				Logar, M; Jeraj, R; Glumac, B			The effect of pitch, burnup, and absorbers on a TRIGA spent-fuel pool criticality safety	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						criticality analysis; research reactor; burnup		It has been shown that supercriticality might occur for some postulated accident conditions at the TRIGA spent-fuel pool. However, the effect of burnup was not accounted for in previous studies. In this work, the combined effect of fuel burnup, pitch among fuel elements, and number of uniformly mixed absorber rods for a square arrangement on the spent-fuel pool k(eff) is investigated. The Monte Carlo computer code MCNP4B with the ENDF-B/VI library and detailed three dimensional geometry was used. The WIMS-D code was used to model the isotopic composition of the standard TRIGA and FLIP fuel for 5, 10, 20 and 30% burnup level and 2- and 4-yr cooling time. The results show that out of the three studied effects, pitch from contact (3.75 cm) up to rack design pitch (8 cm), number of absorbers from zero to eight, and burnup up to 30%, the pitch has the greatest influence on the multiplication factor keff. In the interval in which the pitch was changed, keff decreased for up to similar to0.4 for standard and similar to0.3 for FLIP fuel. The number of absorber rods affects the multiplication factor much less. This effect is bigger for more compact arrangements, e.g., for contact of standard fuel elements with eight absorber rods among them, keff values are smaller for similar to0.2 (similar to0.1 for FLIP) than for arrangements without absorber rods almost regardless of the burnup. The effect of burnup is the smallest. For standard fuel elements, it is similar to0.1 for almost all pitches and numbers of absorbers. For FLIP fuel, it is smaller for a factor of 3, but increases with the burnup for compact arrangements. Cooling time of fuel has just a minor effect on the keff of spent-fuel pool and can be neglected in spent-fuel pool design.

Contributions to the full-energy peak by multiple scattering of gamma rays preceding the photoelectric interaction were tabulated. The applicability of the commonly used straight-line relationship in logarithmic coordinates to plot intrinsic efficiency versus energy was tested for 14 detectors with widely different dimensions. Published empirical equations for predicting efficiency versus energy on the basis of detector volume were compared with simulation results. An equation that appears to be applicable to a wider range of volumes was obtained. The development of this equation makes it possible to evaluate the efficiencies of detectors with a wide range of volumes without necessitating direct measurement. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Alpha and beta activities per unit volume, due to radon (Rn-222), thoron (Rn-220) and their decay products, were evaluated inside cigarette smokes of tobacco samples studied. Annual committed equivalent doses due to short-lived radon decay products from the inhalation of various cigarette smokes were determined in the thoracic and extrathoracic regions of the respiratory tract. Three types of cigarettes made in Morocco of black tobacco show higher annual committed equivalent doses in the extrathoracic and-thoracic regions of the respiratory tract than the other studied cigarettes (except one type of cigarettes made in France of yellow tobacco); their corresponding annual committed equivalent dose ratios are larger than 1.8. Measured annual committed equivalent doses ranged from 1.8 x 10(-9) to 1.10 x 10(-3) Sv yr(-1) in the extrathoracic region and from 1.3 x 10(-10) to 7.6 x 10(-6) Sv yr(-1) in the thoracic region of the respiratory tract for a smoker consuming 20 cigarettes a day.

Portable cameras allow easy transfer of the detector, thus of radioisotope imaging, where the bioptical procedure takes place. In this paper we describe a preliminary experience on radionuclide Breast Cancer (BC) imaging with a 22.8 x 22.8 mm(2) FOV minicamera, already used by our group for sentinel node detection with the name of Imaging Probe (IP). In this work IP BC detection was performed with the aim of guiding biopsy, in particular open biopsy, or to help or modify fine needle or needle addressing when main driving method was echography or digital radiography. The IP prototype weight was about I kg. This small scintillation camera is based on the compact Position Sensitive Photomultiplier Tube Hamamatsu R7600-00-C8, coupled to a CsI(TI) scintillation array 2.6 x 2.6 x 5.0 mm(3) crystal-pixel size. Spatial resolution of the IP was 2.5 mm Full-Width at Half-Maximum at laboratory tests. IP was provided with acquisition software allowing quick change of pixels number on the computer acquisition frame and an on-line image-smoothing program. Both these programs were developed in order to allow nuclear physicians to quickly get target source when the patient was anesthetized in the operator room, with sterile conditions. Tc-99m Sestamibi (MIBI) was injected at the dose of 740 MBq 1 h before imaging and biopsy to 14 patients with suspicious or known BC. Scintigraphic images were acquired before and after biopsy in each patient. Operator was allowed to take into account scintigraphic images as well as previously performed X-ray mammograms and echographies. High-resolution IP images were able to guide biopsy toward cancer or washout zones of the cancer, that are thought to be chemoresistant in 7 patients out of 10. Four patients, in whom IP and MIBI were not able to guide biopsy, did not show cancer. Two patients in whom biopsy was performed in the high washout zone, did show Multi Drug Resistance (MDR) gene product at immunohistochemistry on bioptical samples. Specific radioactivity was measured on biopsy specimens and measurement confirmed the etherogeneous distribution of MIBI within cancers. Our study confirms the ability of IP to guide breast biopsy even when our mini-camera has to be manually handled by trained physicians during operation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

First experiences allowed us to develop dedicated prototypes for specific applications. At the moment the most intriguing field is guiding biopsy. Dedicated detectors, characterized by low cost and weight, allow to transfer imaging where the biopsy has to be done. In this paper, a new combined. application for breast cancer detection is described. In present system IP is put inside a Fisher digital stereotactic device prepared for Mammotome biopsy: so biopsy can contemporaneously be driven by Xray stereotaxis and Tc-99m-Sestamibi (MIBI) images from IP. The Field Of View (FOV) is about 2 x 2 cm(2) and 0.8 kg weight. This novel scintillation camera is based upon the compact Hamamatsu R7600-00-C8 Position Sensitive Photomultiplier Tube (PSPMT), coupled to scintillating arrays. The PSPMT can be arranged as array when larger FOV is needed. Present application was provided with off line software for image fusion running on the IP dedicated PC. It was matched with the Fisher digital stereotactic X-ray device dedicated to address Mammotome (Ethicon Endo-surgery by Johnson and Johnson) towards breast opacities. Spatial resolution of the IP was 2.5 mm Full-Width Half-Maximum (FWHM) at laboratory tests. A preliminary IP-X-ray digital system inter-calibration was performed using a Perspexlead phantom. Tc-99m MIBI was injected at the dose of 740 MBq I It before biopsy to three patients with breast opacities of respectively 0.6, 0.8 and 1.5 cm, scheduled for Mammotome biopsy. Sixty-four pixel scintigraphic images were acquired before and after biopsy in each patient. Operator was allowed to slightly correct the direction of the Mammotome needle taking into account stercotactic X-ray, scintigraphic and fused images. Bioptic samples were also counted with IP before sending them to pathologist. High-resolution IP scintigraphy showed substantial, though not exact, matching between MIBI hot spots and X-ray opacities. More than one hot spot were detected even in the smallest 0.6 cm lesion. Post biopsy scintigraphy showed absence of significant hot spots in two patients, whereas in the third one of the three hot spots still was partially present. All the lesions showed cancer at histological exam. Measurement of radioactivity on biopsy specimens confirmed the heterogeneous distribution of radioactivity within cancers that IP had detected before biopsy. Or study confirms the ability of IP to guide biopsy or anyway to correct X-ray stereotactic drive. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In case of polarized hydrogen or deuterium targets, recombination of the atoms occurs during the collisions of the atoms with the walls of the storage cell and may lead to a reduction of the target polarization. In this paper, we present measurements of recombination at the polarized internal hydrogen and deuterium gas target of the HERMES experiment in the years 1997-1999 within a temperature range of 35-250 K. The underlying reaction mechanisms will be discussed with respect to the measured temperature and gas density dependence of surface recombination. Special attention is paid to the influence of water on recombination. These dependencies can be consistently described by a combination of three reaction mechanisms. The first one, dominating at temperatures above 120 K, is an activated Eley-Rideal reaction. A second process dominating below 100 K in case of new storage cells, is interpreted as a tunneling reaction between a physisorbed state and an atom chemically bound on the surface. When the storage cell coating is aged by the influence of the HERA positron beam, the second process is suppressed and a third (weaker) process starts to dominate. This third mechanism is described by Langmuir-Hinshelwood type reactions between physisorbed atoms. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

The polarized atoms of hydrogen or deuterium are accumulated in an open-ended thin walled storage cell through which the circulating electron or positron beam of the HERA accelerator passes. The target areal density is 10(14) atoms/cm(2), two orders of magnitude larger than without the cell. The construction details of the cell are described and the cell's performance during HERMES run of 1997-2000 is discussed. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.
