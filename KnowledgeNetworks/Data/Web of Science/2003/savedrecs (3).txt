Materials and methods: Re-188 tin particles were immobilized on a bandage patch (Re-188 bandage). The effectiveness of the Re-188 bandage for controlling tumour growth was tested in C57BL/6 mice bearing BL6/FIO melanoma. The effect of the single dose delivered, two-dose treatment and time of contact of bandages on the skin was studied by following tumour size. Results: Tumour growth was delayed significantly in treated animals compared with controls. Complete tumour regression was observed with some doses of radiation. Histology studies and dose-rate calculations were also carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of Re-188 bandages. Conclusions: Radioactive bandages could be a promising modality for the treatment of skin cancers.

In this paper, we focus on the mechanical behavior of uranium dioxide. These pellets exhibit a yield point during strain hardening tests and sigmoidal creep curves, that is inflection points characteristic of a non-monotonous viscoplastic flow in the first stages of the tests. Inspired by Alexander and Haasen's work upon single crystal silicon, we develop a dislocation-based model that is able to describe the viscoplasticity of uranium dioxide in the range of temperature and stress of the PCMI. After developing this model, we introduce it into the Pilvin's polycrystalline approach. The self-consistency of the polycrystalline approach in the case of a non-monotonous viscoplastic flow is demonstrated in an independent article. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, they are sensitive to intergranular corrosion in boiling nitric acid media in the presence of oxidizing ions like hexavalent chromium, tetravalent iron and hexavalent plutonium. The Ti-5%Ta-1.8%Nb alloy was evaluated as a candidate material for such applications of nuclear fuel reprocessing. Extensive tests were carried out to establish the superior corrosion properties in comparison to the conventional stainless steel or nitric acid grade stainless steel. The fabricability of this new alloy to various shapes like rod, sheet, wire and its weldability, which is required for making vessels, was found to be good. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

A reinterpretation and critical look at the previously published thermodynamic values for desorption of water from PuO2 [J. Phys. Chem. 77 (1973) 581] are reexamined in light of more recent mathematical treatments of thermal desorption data from high surface area materials. In addition, the time and temperature dependent process of water adsorption/ desorption in closed system experiments is examined using chemical kinetics modeling. A simple experimental method and mathematical treatment of determining adsorption enthalpies based upon a closed system is also described. The desorption enthalpy for reversibly adsorbed water from PuO2 is determined to be a function of adsorbate coverage with values ranging from 51 to 44 kJ mol(-1) for coverages of one to several monolayers (MLs). Consistent desorption enthalpy values are obtained using either approach thus highlighting the importance of proper interpretation of adsorption parameters determined from high surface area powders. Reversible adsorption/desorption equilibrium of water with actinide oxide materials is discussed from the practical standpoint of storage and subsequent pressurization of containers. These results obtained from PuO2 surfaces are consistent with desorption enthalpies of water from a low surface area UO2, that has been measured using ultra-high vacuum thermal desorption mass spectroscopy to be 42.2 kJ mol(-1).

Dissolution reactions of the solid surface and subsequent remineralization are observed at the solid-water interface under different redox conditions and carbonate concentrations. The local dissolution rates vary between different grain faces, grain boundaries and etch pits. A correlation between dissolution rates and the grain orientations relative to the specimen surface can be demonstrated by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Remineralization under oxidizing conditions occurs mainly at grain faces with higher dissolution rates. The remineralized products are particles of 200-900 nm in diameter and exhibit a tabular morphology. Profound knowledge of the UO2 surface chemistry on a nanoscale may help to clarify the related mechanisms explaining the macroscopically observed dissolution rates. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

TROI-13 and TROI-14 used corium, which is a mixture of UO2 and ZrO2 at a 70:30 wt%, while TROI-15 used ZrO2. These three cases resulted in spontaneous steam explosions. It is an important observation from the aspect of the explosivity of prototypic material, as it was not observed in the previous experiments. Various aspects of the test results including cold crucible melting, hydrogen generation, melt temperature measurement, debris morphology, size distribution of the debris, dynamic pressure, dynamic force, shape of the melt jet, location of the trigger, response of the vessel pressure, and the response of the water pool temperature are discussed. The potential contributors to the explosivity of corium are suggested.

Strontium was separated from americium and plutonium fraction at the beginning of the method to increase the Sr recovery. The studied soils coming from an Alpine wetland site contain a big amount of iron which was eliminated by an oxalate precipitation before the column step. The hydroxide precipitation should be made by adding iron of known quantity to avoid interference. The procedure was validated by reference soils from IAEA. Plutonium-238,239,240, Am-241, Sr-90 and Cs-137 activities are given and some isotopic ratios are calculated in order to know the origin of the radionuclides.

The artificial radionuclides considered were Sr-90, Cs-137, Pu239+240, Pu-238 and Am-241. The contamination seems to be higher in the continental environment rather than in the marine one. Mosses, algae and lichens showed the highest values for all radionuclides analyzed. The results prove that the Antarctic continent is interested by radioactive pollution. As far as Cs-137 is concerned, a progressive decrease was observed.

Construction and examination of the tritium sampler and its arrangement at the site are mainly discussed. Atmospheric tritium concentrations at Toki site were determined in the sampling period from September 2000 to June 2001. Although the data for HTO were low because of their low specific activity(0.62 Bq/l), our average HT and CH3T data were 9.1 and 3.3 mBq/m(3), respectively, and systematically lower than the previously reported values at the same site, even if the considerable decay correction was carried out. Suitable monitoring points are discussed by considering the local meteorological features at the Toki site. Since the wind conditions at this site were governed by diurnal and nocturnal wind blowing to the contrary directions, it is concluded that the monitoring points should be placed at the site boundary of downwind direction of these winds. Considering that the expected levels of effluent tritium in the D-D experiment at the National Institute for Fusion Science are competitive with those in the environment, the detailed variations of the environmental tritium should be comprehended to detect minute amounts of the artificial tritium.

Effects of pH and various ions like La3+, Fe3+, Ce4+, SiO32- etc., have been examined. Synthetic mixtures of UO22+ and Th4+ in different concentrations were passed through the bed and eluted separately with various selective reagents viz. ammonium carbonate, sodium carbonate and acetic acid-sodium hydroxide buffer. Separations of these elements at ppm level are shown to be very effective. The separation of uranium and thorium in the presence of lanthanides in monazite sand has been studied successfully. In the analysis of monazites and, the oxalate precipitation has been avoided. The method is simple and of very low cost. The modified fly ash bed can also be used to remove uranium from contaminated water.

In coastal sediments near the Korean Peninsula, Pu239+240 concentrations varied from 0.02 to 1.72 Bq.kg(-1), and their Pu-240 /Pu-239 atom ratios from 0.15 to 0.24, with an average of 0.20+/-0.03. Pu-240/Pu-239 atom ratios of bottom sediments in the deep NW Pacific Ocean and its marginal seas(East,Okhotsk seas) were in the range of 0.15-0.23. A little elevated Pu-240/Pu-239 atom ratios in the bottom layer sediment may be due to Pu released into the environment during the pre-moratorium period, having high Pu-240 /Pu-239 atom ratios and low Pu-238/Pu239+240 activity ratios.

Using a cadmium capsule, about 0.1-0.2 g samples were irradiated for 6 hours in the Triga Mark II Reactor. Measurements of gamma-ray (Np-239 via U-239) were performed with each sample and standard after cooling for about three days. Compared with a non-destructive thermal NAA, the present method was found to improve the sensitivity because it reduced the intense Compton background induced by Na-24. We determined uranium in coral standards within 2% of analytical precision. The data obtained for the carbonate standards are mostly consistent with reported values. The present method could be usefully applied to determine uranium contents in fossil corals from the Funafuti Atoll in the Pacific. The distribution of uranium between seawater and coral skeletons is also discussed in order to understand the environmental media in which the coral grew.

J	Lin, CC; Chu, TC; Huang, YF				Lin, CC; Chu, TC; Huang, YF			Variations of U/Th-series nuclides with associated chemical factors in the hot spring area of northern Taiwan	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							LOW-TEMPERATURES; URANIUM; THORIUM; DISEQUILIBRIUM; SAMPLES; WATERS	The relationship of the activity ratios (ARs) of U/Th-series nuclides and associated factors (pH, Eh, and the concentrations of Cl- and SO42-) in the hot spring area of Taipei were determined. The contents of U and Th in water decreased with increasing pH. The U-234/U-238 ARs have been ascribed to alpha recoil and selective leaching of U-234, while the U-234/U-238 disequilibrium was not significant with regard to the statistical error. Variations of Th-230/U-234 ARs can be attributed to the different chemical properties of Th-230 and U-234. The disequilibrium of Ra-226/Th-230 can be ascribed to the complexation of thorium with Cl- and SO42-; and to the co-precipitation of radium with sulfates. The disequilibrium of Th-228/Tb-23h can be due to the co-precipitation of Ra-228 with (Ba,Pb)SO4 and to the migration of Th-228 from the sediment into the water.

The distribution coefficient (K-d) of similar to7000 ml/g (similar to90% sorption) and 70 ml/g (similar to20% sorption) was obtained for the sorption of cesium and strontium in 0.1M nitric acid, respectively. Experimental sorption capacity, b for cesium was found to be 50 mg/g from 0.1M HNO3 and 30 mg/g for strontium from 0.001M nitric acid. The sorption of strontium on the sorbent was accompanied by the absorption of heat but the sorption of Cs+ results in the liberation of heat. Column studies were conducted by following a breakthrough (BT) curve of cesium and strontium up to C/C-o = 1 and the results are reported.

The derivation of the kinetic differential equations was based on the reactions of Eu3+ with, so called, strong (HAS) and weak (HAW) carboxylic groups of HA formulated in accordance with the ne complexation model.(1) The differential equations determining d[Eu(alpha)HAS]/dt and d[Eu(b)HAW]/dt have the classical form applicable for reversible reactions where the forward reaction is the C-reaction and the reverse one is the D-reaction. Kinetic model used for the evaluation of experimental data includes these differential equations and the film diffusion model of sorption of Eu3+ on Amberlite IR-120(Na).

All solvent systems exhibit a maximum distribution ratio restricted in the acidity range 3-4 mol/dm(3). An obvious difference in extraction behavior through amine system has been observed for two acids, HCl and HNO3, distinguishing the divergent interactions attributed to the different mechanism of complexation depending on the acidic medium. The high degree of separation of UO22+ from HNO3 solution is feasible through a complex formation with extractants ranging in the order CYANEX 302 > TBP > Alamine 308. The results were correlated using various versions of the mass action law, i.e., a chemodel approach and a modified version of the Langmuir equilibrium model comprising the formation of one or at least two U(VI)-extractant aggregated structures.

The optimum experimental conditions have been evaluated by studying various parameters such as pH, equilibration period, reagent concentration, metal concentration, and solvents. Effect of diverse anions and cations on the extraction has also been studied. The extracted species, determined by log D - log R plots are represented as, [UO2(Apy)(4)(ClO4)(2)], [UO2(Apy)(2)(TCA)(2)], [UO2(Apy)(2)(DCA)(2)], [UO2(Apy)(H2O)(MCA)(2)]. The conditional stability constants of the quantitatively extracted complexes are calculated. The proposed method allows the selective separation of uranium(VI) from multicomponent mixtures and geological matrices and is also applied for the separation and chemical characterization of impurities at trace and ultratrace levels.

The average activity concentrations of radioactive elements such as Th-232, U-238 and K-40 were measured by gamma ray spectrometry using a HPGe detector, and found to be 2650+/-50, 400+/-30 and 120+/-30 Bq/kg, respectively, for the bulk sand samples. The activity concentrations in monazite and zircon sands are found to be 305,000+/-2000 and 2000+/-150 Bq/kg for the Th-232 and 21,500+/-300 and 3450+/-250 Bq/kg for the U-238. Electron probe microanalysis results of monazite sands show the average ThO2 and UO3 concentrations to be 10.42 wt.%, and 0.32 wt.%, respectively. The major contributors for the enhanced level of radioactivity are monazite and zircon sands. These heavy mineral sands were derived from the nearby source areas such as Eastern Ghats Group of rocks.

The elemental analysis of water and sediment samples was performed by PIXE using the 3X2 MeV NEC Tandem accelerator at the Taipei Institute of Physics. The characterization of alpha- and beta-radioactive levels for water and sediment samples was performed by a BH1216, low background radioactivity instrument at the Shanghai Institute of Nuclear Research. The PIXE results showed that the elemental contents of Cl, K, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, Zn and Pb in river water gradually decreased with the rising tide. At high tide, their concentrations were minimum and then increased toward the ebb tide. The analysis also demonstrated that the radioactivity of water samples had been gradually decreasing year by year. It was found that the decreasing rate of alpha-radioactivity was a little quicker than that of beta-radioactivity. Further aspects of environmental data evaluation and assessment are also discussed.

These are: a diffusion equation derived for a plane source model, a rate equation for diffusion coupled with a first-order reaction and an empirical method employing a polynomial equation. The results are compared with respect to their applicability to the Cs-137 leaching data. The results presented in this paper are part of those obtained in a 25-year mortar and concrete testing project which will influence the design of radioactive waste management for a future Serbian radioactive waste disposal center.

In this study, gamma-ray spectrometric measurement for the determination of the absolute intensity, P-gamma, of 1001 keV gamma-rays of Pa-234m was carried out using powdered uranium samples and a new experimental value of 0.861+/-0.015% for P-gamma of the 1001 keV gamma-ray of Pa-234m has been obtained. The present measured value is greater than most of the recent experimental results and the newly recommended value of 0.835+/-0.004% for P-gamma by 2.5 to 4%. The present result differs from the latest experimental value of 0.92+/-0.02% by 7%.

As such, its disposal requires isolation from the biosphere in stable deep geological formations for long periods of time (some hundred thousand years) until its radioactivity decreases through the process of radioactive decay. Ways for significantly reducing the volumes and radiotoxicities of the waste and to shorten the very long times for which the waste must be stored safely are being investigated. This is the motivation behind the partitioning and transmutation (P&T) activities worldwide. This paper addresses the potential impact of P&T on the long-term disposal of nuclear waste. In particular, it evaluates how realistic P&T scenarios can lead to a reduction in the time required for the waste to be stored safely. The calculations have been done independently by three research groups: ITU and FZK in Germany, and by the CEA in France.

In general, the Nuclear Site Licence Conditions apply in totality but there are some conditions which are more applicable than others for contaminated land. For example, Licence Condition 4 requires BNFL to control the storage of nuclear matter including radioactive waste on the licensed site.

Because radiation exposure is such an emotive subject, it is particularly important that the decision-making process goes beyond science and economics. The key issue therefore is how the concerns and perceptions of various stakeholders who are less concerned with quantified levels of risk can be factored into the decision-making process in a way which means that if the course of action indicated by technical/economic analysis is not to be followed, then this is clone clearly and transparently with an understanding about the implications,for priorities in the use of resources to reduce risk. This paper looks at the scientific nature of the risks and how these might be better presented. It also shows the stark choices which exist for the best allocation of resources to reduce risk; and finally, it tries to address the difficult and complex issue of how, less-quantifiable socio-political issues might fairly and transparently be included in the total decision-making process.

J	Duan, RQ; Koshizuka, S; Oka, Y				Duan, RQ; Koshizuka, S; Oka, Y			Two-dimensional simulation of drop deformation and breakup at around the critical Weber number	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							AXISYMMETRICAL LIQUID-DROPS; SIMPLE SHEAR-FLOW; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; SECONDARY BREAKUP; PARTICLE METHOD; ACCELERATION; FRAGMENTATION; DISTORTION; BEHAVIOR; FLUID	The breakup of two-dimensional liquid drops is numerically investigated at around the critical Weber number. The Moving Particle Semi-implicit (MPS) method is used to solve the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations for both the drops and the ambient fluid. The two dominant forces affecting drop breakup, pressure drag and surface tension force, are verified using the two benchmarks: pressure distribution on the surface of a cylinder in a uniform flow and oscillation of a square drop under surface tension force. The results show that the breakup process occurs in two stages. During the first stage, the drops become stretched and thinned normal to the flow direction of the ambient fluid. During the second stage, detached points appear on the surface of the drops, which are ascribed to the unstable growth of surface waves. The post-breakup topology of the drops is dependent on the value of the Weber number: the larger the Weber number is, the more detached points on the surface of the drops emerge. Another feature commonly shared in the two stages is that some fine fragmentations are stripped from the equatorial edges of the drops. The critical Weber number is predicted to be 13 for uranium dioxide drops in water, at which breakup regime is consistent with the so-called vibration regime. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

J	Shelley, A; Shimada, S; Kugo, T; Okubo, T; Iwamura, T				Shelley, A; Shimada, S; Kugo, T; Okubo, T; Iwamura, T			Optimization of seed-blanket type fuel assembly for reduced-moderation water reactor	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								Parametric studies have been performed for a PWR-type reduced-moderation water reactor (RMWR) with the seed-blanket type fuel assembles to achieve a high conversion ratio, negative void reactivity coefficient and a high burnup by using MOX fuel. From the viewpoint of reactor safety analysis, the fuel temperature coefficients were also studied. From the result of the burnup calculation, it has been seen that ratio of 40-50% of outer blanket in a seed-blanket assembly gives higher conversion ratio compared to the other combination of seed-blanket assembly. And the recommended number of (seed + blanket) layers is 20, in which the number of seed (S) layers is 15 (S 15) and blanket (B) layers is 5 (B5). It was found that the conversion ratio of seed-blanket assembly decreases, when they are arranged looks like a flower shape (Hanagara). By the optimization of different parameters, S 15B5 fuel assembly with the height of seed of 1000 mm x 2, internal blanket of 150 mm and axial blanket of 400 mm x 2 is recommended for a reactor of high conversion ratio. In this assembly, the gap of seed fuel rod is 1.0 mm and blanket fuel rod is 0.4 mm. In S 15B5 assembly, the conversion ratio is 1.0 and the burnup is 38.18 GWd/t in (seed + internal blanket + outer blanket) region. However, the burnup is 57.45 GWd/t in (seed + internal blanket) region. The cycle length of the core is 16.46 effective full power in month (EFPM) by six batches and the enrichment of fissile Pu is 14.64 wt.%. The void coefficient is +21.82 pcm/%void, however, it is expected that the void coefficient will be negative if the radial neutron leakage is taken into account in the calculation. It is also possible to use S 15B5 fuel assembly as a high burnup reactor 45 GWd/t in (seed + internal blanket + outer blanket) region, however, it is necessary to decrease the height of seed to 500 mm x 2 to improve the void coefficient. In this reactor, the conversion ratio is 0.97 and void coefficient is +20.81 pcm/%void. The fuel temperature coefficient is negative for both of cases. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

A movable source can be positioned remotely to illuminate each scintillator tile individually, and the resulting photo-detector current is measured to provide the relative calibration. The unique measurement technique described here makes use of the normal high-speed data acquisition system required for signal digitization at the 40 MHz collider frequency. The data paths for collider measurements and source measurements are then identical, and systematic uncertainties associated with having different signal paths are avoided. In this high-speed mode, the source signal is observed as a Poisson photo-electron distribution with a mean that is smaller than the width of the electronics noise (pedestal) distribution. We report demonstration of the technique using prototype electronics for the complete readout chain and show the typical response observed with a 144 channel test beam system. The electronics noise has a root-mean l-square of 1.6 least counts, and a 1 mCi source produces a shift of the mean value of 0.1 least counts. Because of the speed of the data acquisition system, this shift can be measured to a statistical precision better than a fraction of a percent on a millisecond time scale. The result is reproducible to better than 2% over a time scale of 1 month. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Experimental microscopic cross section data published earlier or measured recently and not yet included in the evaluation work of IAEA were collected and added to the primary database in order to improve the quality of the recommended data. The newly compiled experimental data supported the previous recommended data in most cases, but in a few cases this influenced the decision made earlier and resulted in new selected cross section data sets. A spline fitting method was applied to the selected data sets and updated recommended data were produced in these cases. The integral thick target yields deduced from the new recommended cross sections were critically compared with experimental yield data available in the literature. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The initial beam was produced by the classical method, using germanium dioxide in our micro-oven and helium as support gas. The overall ionization efficiency was measured and found to be around 3%. Without the oven, and using SF6 instead of helium, the ECR-4 ion source has been able to produce a very stable beam during a two-week period. The intensity of Ge-76(13+) (enrichment 88%) was increased to 40 e muA, and the overall ionization efficiency reached 40%. The oven method of production, the recycling effect and perspectives are described in this paper. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Rothe, RE				Rothe, RE			The critical mass laboratory at rocky flats	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							BENCHMARK CRITICAL EXPERIMENTS; NITRATE SOLUTION SYSTEMS; URANIUM SOLUTION; SPHERES	The Critical Mass Laboratory (CML) at Rocky Flats northwest of Denver, Colorado, was built in 1964 and commissioned to conduct nuclear experiments on January 28, 1965. It was built to attain more accurate and precise experimental data to ensure nuclear criticality safely at the plant than were previously possible. Prior to its construction, safely data were obtained from long extrapolations of subcritical data (called in situ experiments), calculated parameters from reactor engineering "models," and a few other imprecise methods. About 1700 critical and critical-approach experiments involving several chemical forms of enriched uranium and plutonium were performed between then and 1988. These experiments included single units and arrays of fissile materials, reflected and "bare" systems, and configurations with various degrees of moderation, as well as some containing strong neutron absorbers. In 1989, a raid by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) caused the plant as a whole to focus on "resumption" instead of further criticality safety experiments. Though either not recognized or not admitted for a few years, that FBI raid did sound the death knell for the CML. The plant's optimistic goal of resumption evolved to one of deactivation, decommissioning, and plantwide demolition during the 1990s. The once-proud CML facility was finally demolished in April of 2002.		Rothe, RE (reprint author), 3965 Britting Ave, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.

These experiments include critical experiments in water-moderated facilities pertaining to substantiation of reactor physics for VVER-type light water reactors with uranium enrichments varying from natural uranium to similar to6.5%; in heterogeneous critical assemblies with a widely varying uranium enrichment (from 5 to 96%) for small nuclear power systems of various applications; in critical assemblies with a uranyl sulfate solution core; and in critical assemblies simulating peculiarities of high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGR), RBMK physics, etc. A list of critical assemblies currently in operation at RRC KI is given. Future experimental programs are briefly described; their implementation, if based on the ICSBEP requirements, will be useful for the international community. Using RRC KI as an example, it is demonstrated that Russian nuclear centers maintain capabilities for carrying out a wide range of new critical experiments, including international cooperation in this area.

J	Elam, KR; Rearden, BT				Elam, KR; Rearden, BT			Use of sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to select benchmark experiments for the validation of computer codes and data	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							RATIOS	Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis methodologies under development at Oak Ridge National Laboratory were applied to determine whether existing benchmark experiments adequately cover the area of applicability for the criticality code and data validation of PuO2 and mixed-oxide (MOX) powder systems. The study examined three PuO2 powder systems and four MOX powder systems that would be useful for establishing mass limits for a MOX fuel fabrication facility. Using traditional methods to choose experiments for criticality analysis validation, 46 benchmark critical experiments were identified as applicable to the PuO2 powder systems. However, only 14 experiments were thought to be within the area of applicability for dry MOX powder systems. The applicability of 318 benchmark critical experiments, including the 60 experiments initially identified, was assessed. Each benchmark and powder system was analyzed using the Tools for Sensitivity and UNcertainty Analysis Methodology Implementation (TSUNAMI) one-dimensional (TSUNAMI-ID) or TSUNAMI three-dimensional (TSUNAMI-3D) sensitivity analysis sequences, which will be included in the next release of the SCALE code system. This sensitivity data and cross-section uncertainty data were then processed with TSUNAMI-IP to determine the correlation of each application to each experiment in the benchmarking set. Correlation coefficients are used to assess the similarity between systems and determine the applicability of one system for the code and data validation of another. The applicability of most of the experiments identified using traditional methods was confirmed by the TSUNAMI analysis. In addition, some PuO2 and MOX powder systems were determined to be within the area of applicability of several other benchmarks that would not have been considered using traditional methods. Therefore, the number of benchmark experiments useful for the validation of these systems exceeds the number previously expected. The TSUNAMI analysis also emphasized some areas where more benchmark data are needed, indicating the need for further evaluation of existing experiments, or possibly the completion of new experiments to fill these gaps. This lack of evaluated data is particularly important for very dry and dense MOX powder systems.

These benchmarks allow for testing the cross-section data for both common reactor nuclides such as H-1, O-16, and U-235,U-238 and structural and shielding elements such as Al, Ti, Fe, Ni, and Pb. The latest cross-section libraries yield near-unity eigenvalues for unreflected or water-reflected HEU-SOL-THERM and LEU-SOL-THERM systems. Near-unity eigenvalues are also obtained for bare HEU-MET-FAST and IEU-MET-FAST systems, but small deviations from unity are observed in both FAST and THERM benchmarks as a function of nonhydrogenous reflector material and thickness. The long-standing problem of lower eigenvalues in water-reflected low-enriched-uranium fuel lattice systems remains, regardless of cross-section library.

From 1962 until 2002, numerous critical experiments were carried out with low-enriched uranium and high-enriched uranium fuel elements of tubular shape, known as the Russian TVR-S fuel assembly type, placed in various heavy water square lattices within the RB cylindrical aluminum tank. Some of these well-documented experiments were selected, described, evaluated, and accepted for inclusion in the "International Handbook of Evaluated Criticality Safety Benchmark Experiments," contributing to the preservation of a rather small number of heavy water benchmark critical experiments.

J	Loaiza, DJ; Sanchez, R				Loaiza, DJ; Sanchez, R			Examination of the 2x2 SiO2, Al, and Fe experiments mixed with highly enriched uranium on the thermal energy region	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article								The basic characteristics of waste materials such as silicon dioxide, aluminum, and iron fueled with highly enriched uranium (HEU) and moderated and reflected by polyethylene were investigated. These critical experiments were performed at the Los Alamos Criticality Experiments Facility. The primary intention of these experiments is to provide supplementary data that can be used to validate and improve criticality data for the Yucca Mountain and the Hanford Storage Waste Tanks Projects. The secondary intention of the 2x2 experiments is to reduce the H/U ratio and increase the waste material/U ratio from previously published experiments. These experiments were designed to supply data for interlaced waste material/fuel/moderator systems on the thermal region. The experiments contained silicon dioxide (SiO2), aluminum (Al), and iron (Fe) mixed with 93.23% enriched uranium and moderated and reflected by polyethylene. This analysis systematically examines uncertainties associated with the critical experiments as they affect the calculated multiplication factor. The systematic analysis is separated into uncertainties due to mass measurements, uncertainties due to fabrication, and uncertainties due to composition. Each type of uncertainty is analyzed individually, and a total combined uncertainty is derived. The SiO2-HEU experiment had a measured k(eff) of 0.993, the Al-HEU experiment had a measured keff of 0.990, and the Fe-HEU experiment had a measured k(eff) of 1.000. The calculated k(eff) values tend to agree well with the experimental values. The sensitivity analysis of these critical experiments yielded a total combined uncertainty on the measured keff of +/-0.0044 for SiO2, of +/-0.0048 for Al, and of +/-0.0046 for Fe.

Eight experiments (116 configurations) for the plutonium solution and plutonium-uranium mixture systems performed at Valduc, Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories, and other facilities were selected and used in the studies. The averaged multiplication factors calculated with MVP and MCNP-4B using the same neutron cross-section libraries based on JENDL-3.2 were in good agreement. Based on methods provided in the Japanese nuclear criticality-safety handbook, the estimated criticality lower-limit multiplication factors to be used as a subcriticality criterion for the criticality-safety evaluation of nuclear facilities were obtained. The analysis proved the applicability of the MVP code to the criticalily-safety analysis of nuclear fuel facilities, particularly to the analysis of systems fueled with plutonium and in homogeneous and thermal-energy conditions.

Erosion behavior of inside surfaces of stainless and carbon steel pipes by a swirling airflow containing alumina or cast-iron grit abrasive was studied. Erosion depths of the test pipes were approximately proportional to an abrasive concentration in air and an exponent of flow rate of airstream. The experimental results indicated that the present method could keep satisfactory erosion ability of abrasives even for a large-size pipe. The present method was successfully applied to Co-60-contaminated specimens sampled from a pipe of the water cleanup system of the Japan Power Demonstration Reactor.

Storage intact of light water reactor (LWR) spent nuclear fuel, a single recycle in a LWR of the plutonium as mixed-oxide fuel, and the repeated recycle of the transuranics in critical and subcritical fast reactors are compared with the focus on the waste management performance of these systems. Other considerations such as cost and technological challenges were beyond the scope of this study. The overall conclusion of the studies is that repeated recycling of the transuranics from spent nuclear fuel would significantly increase the capacity of high-level waste repositories per unit of nuclear energy produced, significantly increase the nuclear energy production per unit mass of uranium ore mined, significantly reduce the radiotoxicity of the waste streams per unit of nuclear energy produced, and significantly enhance the proliferation resistance of the material stored in high-level waste repositories.

J	Cho, DK; Kim, MH				Cho, DK; Kim, MH			Uncertainty analysis on fission molybdenum production with a nuclear fuel target in a research reactor	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						uncertainty analysis; radioisotope production; fission molybdenum	CODE	The use of a low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel target was examined for the feasibility the of Mo-99\ production in a High-flux Advanced Neutron Application Reactor (HANARO). Uncertainty analysis was done with respect to the Mo-99 yield ratio, Pu-239 yield ratio, annual production rate, and decontamination requirement. Validity of a coupled code system, MCNP/ORIGEN2, was evaluated to estimate reliable isotopic number densities after irradiation and cooling. An equilibrium core model for the MCNP fixed-source problem was found by the reactor design methodology known as WIMS/VENTURE. Optimized target design options were proposed for both the LEU and highly enriched uranium (HEU) targets. Variables related to the target fabrication process and reactor physics condition were considered as uncertainty-inducing parameters. The most important factor affecting the overall uncertainty of the LEU option was the engineering tolerances achievable in the fabrication process of fuel film. The LEU has twice the uncertainty of HEU under current technology, which makes the economics of LEU worse than HEU. It is acceptable, however, in view of the radioactive purity of the alpha emitter because the uncertainty of the impurity level of Pu-239 is expected to be relatively small-only 6.5% with a 95% confidence level.

Taking into account the experimental setup parameters (e.g., drum geometry, drum-detector distance, collimator geometry, etc.), the peak count rate versus the angular displacement is modeled as a theoretical analytical function of three independent variables (unknowns) for each hot spot: the two coordinates of the hot-spot center of mass and the corresponding activity value. Solutions for unknowns are obtained from equating, for each angular displacement, the experimental count rate to the corresponding theoretical one. Such a procedure has been applied to the SRWGA gamma scanner of the Casaccia Research Center utilizing a set of Waste Packages Reference Standards (with different matrices) where the gamma sources in different radial-azimuthal positions can be located.

The average sizes of the structural subnanovoids are estimated from the pick-off annihilation rates of the ortho-positronium and from the momentum distribution of the para-positronium. It is observed that the sizes of the subnanovoids and the positronium intensities decrease with decreasing SiO2 concentrations in the glasses, which suggests that the positronium is a unique and useful tool for subnanovoids in glass materials.
