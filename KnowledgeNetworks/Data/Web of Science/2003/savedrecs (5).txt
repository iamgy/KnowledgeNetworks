That code was originally designed and validated for traditional nuclear power plant safety analyses, and has been internationally recognized as a relevant nuclear source term codes for nuclear fission plants. It permits the simulation of chemical reactions and transport of radioactive gases and aerosols under two-phase flow transients in generic flow systems, using a built-in thermal-hydraulic model. A comparison with the results given in ITER Generic Site Safety Report, obtained using a thermal-hydraulic system code (ATHENA), a containment code (INTRA) and an aerosol transportation code (NAUA), in a sequential way, is also presented and discussed.

By 2005, part of these experiments will involve Deuterium-Tritium targets in which fusion reaction will result in radiation-mainly in the form of neutron flux and photon radiation from activated materials-that constitute a source of radiological exposure at the workplace. At the conception stage, an evaluation of the radiological exposures of occupational workers was performed. Different options for reducing these exposures have been studied. Results show that by modifying the composition of the staff or delaying the interventions, a reduction of the individual doses to the most exposed categories of employees from 2 to 50% to a factor 4 can be achieved, without increasing the total collective dose which can be further reduced by 10-25%. This study is a good illustration of how the ALARA principle can be implemented at the conception stage of an installation. Due to the low individual and collective exposures, the different options to reduce doses are more closely associated with staff and planning re-organisations. These options are characterised by a rather low cost and limited constraints of implementation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Building construction phase should start in the first half of year 2003. Use of a deuterium-tritium mixture in the experiments and high neutron yield generation induces hazards such as contamination of equipments inside the target chamber and activation of materials. Calculations have been undertaken to estimate dose rates levels in the facility. Optimization is under development on ALARA principle basis to reduce activation and workers exposure. Decontamination is an other important safety issue for LMJ; different processes are available and have to be considered (lasers, foams...). Radioactive wastes will be generated and their disposal has to be taken into account. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Quantitative health objectives (QHOs) after a release of radioactive tritium and activated tokamak dust are incorporated with master risk curves. It is shown that one of the most favorable safety advantage of a fusion reactor is in its benign hazard characteristics, in which land contamination, equivalent to that experienced in the Chernobyl accident, can be physically excluded. No evacuation of the public is envisaged, although it is prudent to be prepared for potential agriculture restriction. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Detailed three-dimensional torus sector models have been developed for the two PPCS reactor variants to enable proper design calculations with the MCNP Monte Carlo code. It is shown that both blanket concepts can provide tritium self-sufficiency although the tritium breeding potential of the HCPB concept is higher. The HCPB blanket also shows a higher energy multiplication which results, together with a higher thermal efficiency in the power conversion system, in a smaller fusion power required for the same net electrical power. The shielding efficiency of the two reactor models is shown to be similar. A total thickness of I in in for the inboard blanket/ shield system is required to allow the operation of the power reactor over the anticipated lifetime of 40 full power years.

However, carbon is chemically reactive in air and will react with ingress air during a Loss of Vacuum Accident and release tritium fuel that has been retained in the carbon. Tritium mobilization and carbon monoxide generation via CFC oxidation are both safety concerns. This paper discusses chemical reactivity experiments that were performed using the state-of-the-art 3-dimensional NB31 CFC produced by SNECMA and a laminar reaction gas of Ar-21 vol% O-2. Oxidation reaction rates were measured for CFC temperatures of 525, 600, 700, 800, 900, and 1000 degreesC and a 100 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) Ar-O-2 flow rate. Experiments were also performed at CFC temperatures of 700 and 1000 degreesC and a 1000 sccm. Ar-O-2 flow rate. Mass spectral analyses of the exhaust reaction gas suggested that carbon monoxide was the primary reaction at the CFC surface and carbon dioxide was readily produced in the exiting reaction gas. The measured reaction rates compare well with the literature and were used to produce a CFC oxidation curve that is recommended for use in fusion safety analyses. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In the present paper results from a study on disposal possibilities of radioactive waste components from the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor are presented. The possibilities for final disposal of the waste components after 100 years of decay was investigated based on present and planned principles for management of radioactive waste in Germany, Sweden, France and Italy. Four different repository types intended for disposal of low- and intermediate-level waste or non-heat generating radioactive waste from nuclear fission facilities and other sources were considered in the study: Konrad in Germany, SFR in Sweden, Centre de Stockage de l'Aube in France and a future repository for low-level waste in Italy. For the waste that could not be accepted in those repositories deep geological facilities were considered. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In-vessel components are based on the use of SiCf/SiC composite's structure and the use of high-temperature Pb-17Li both as coolant and breeder for the blanket. The use of high-temperature super-conducting coils is also expected. A net electrical output of 1500 MWe is assumed. Tritium breeding self-sufficiency and acceptable operating parameters have been obtained. The resulting conceptual power plant has the potential for a thermal efficiency as high as 61% and for reaching good safety standard. The technological extrapolations assumed in this study provide an indication of the necessary R&D for addressing the most critical issues. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The objective of this study was to identify and assess means for minimizing the off-site transport of radioactive materials, and ultimately the waste quantity to be disposed of. The results indicate that there are practical options for achieving the objective, such as, on-site refurbishing of in-vessel components (IVCs). Refurbishing can also reduce the overall cost associated with the regular replacement of lVCs (about nine times in the reactor lifetime). On-site IVC refurbishing, however, requires that fusion power plants be constructed as multi-unit plants, preferably four or more units per site. The weakest element of the present study is the quantification of the unit cost for reprocessing neutron multiplier and breeder materials. To reduce the study uncertainties, better unit costs need to be developed for future studies. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The factors influencing the primary phase (atmospheric releases) are boundary conditions such as atmospheric and geometric grid from the emission point. The second phase occurs when the tritium is deposited in the ground, and it suffers the transformation rapidly to tritiated water vapour (less than 1 week). This process depends on the kind of soils (clay, loam or sand), relative humidity and microporosity of soil. This phase is decisive in the dosimetric effects by molecular tritium and in the chronic and collective doses to population. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Gas chromatography was found to be the most appropriate method. The main disadvantages of conventional gas chromatography were the long retention times for the heavy hydrogen species of > 30 min. Recent progress in the development of micro-gas chromatography has reduced these retention tirnes to approximate to 3 min. The usefulness of micro-gas chromatography for the analysis of hydrogen and impurity gas mixtures in the fuel cycle of future fusion machines is presented and the advantages and drawbacks are discussed.

In type-I ELMy H-modes simultaneously high confinement (f(H98) similar to 1) and high densities (n/n(GW) > 0.85) were achieved in stationary conditions by several techniques: (a) increasing plasma triangularity (close to ITER values), (b) argon seeding and (c) periodic pellet fuelling. Techniques for controlling high-pressure operation (control of neoclassical tearing modes (NTM)) and improving amelioration of transient divertor heat loads due to ELMs have been elaborated. In Advanced Tokamak Scenarios the improvement of LHCD coupling to the plasma led to reversed shear plasmas, providing reliable access to strong Internal Transport barriers (ITBs) at lower auxiliary heating powers. The successful development of real-time feedback schemes allowed ITBs to be controlled in steady state conditions (7.5 s, 27 x tau(E)). In particular the capability to control both the pressure and current profiles has been demonstrated. Studies related to in-vessel material migration have been further extended, in particular with a new quartz-micro balance diagnostic, further tile analysis and an experimental campaign in helium. This led to new insights, underlining the importance of carbon erosion in the main chamber and chemical erosion in the inner divertor on JET. Altogether this might enable the control of Tritium co-deposition. Detritiation technologies are being developed which could find application on ITER. Enhancements of the facility are undertaken, in view of further extending the operational range closer to ITER, thereby supporting the optimisation of ITER operating scenarios and of ITER auxiliaries.

The main source of supply is as a by-product of heavy water moderated fission reactors and the products are mainly discrete sources or tracers with activity typically in the GBq range. There are in general no restrictions on the use of tritium other than those, which would normally apply to the use of radioactive material. The future use of tritium as intermediate fuel for a fusion power plant series will involve an increase by several orders of magnitude in the industrial use of tritium and may increase concerns relating to safety, transport and waste disposal. In addition, the use of tritium in fusion power will be unable to be satisfied by current sources of supply and tritium production in future fusion power plants will be essential for the operation of the plants as well as for the start of new ones. Power plant studies have, however, shown that these issues can be satisfactorily addressed. In addition the values for clearance of tritiated materials in a number of countries are consistent with the low environmental impact of disposal of tritiated waste. There are, however, many practical operational and regulatory problems, which will need to be solved in the context of the experimental programmes. The current regulations for control and accountancy of tritium inventory, as applied internationally and in specific countries, are reviewed and their influence on the DT fuel cycle considered. The effect of safety case limits on the need for control of tritium inventory in TFTR, JET and ITER is analysed. The sensitivity of the fuel cycle to tritium inventory is considered. The experience of controlling tritium inventory in TFTR and JET is reviewed and the latest results from JET presented. This takes into account the limits and constraints, the differing requirements for tritium processing, in-vessel retention, the needs for waste management and decommissioning including detritiation, and techniques for measurement. Comparisons with ITER requirements are made and the desirable areas for further development identified. Issues of tritium inventory control, which could influence the viability of the DT fuel cycle are discussed and priorities for action proposed. (C) 2003 EURATOM/UKAEA Fusion Association.

Impurities such as oxygen contained in the scrape-off layer (SOL) hydrogen isotope plasma at the divertor surface heated by the plasma can form volatile molecular complexes, e.g. W(x)O(y), causing erosion. Interstitial H atoms retained in the implantation layer also participate in the surface processes, creating volatile H(x)O(y), complexes, which reduce the formation of W(x)O(y) and could mitigate the corrosion effect (H is tritium or deuterium). To consistently estimate the armor erosion by oxygen, the retention of H atoms in the implantation layer and the surface reactions are preliminary modeled. The behavior of H atoms is described by equations that include the diffusion in- and the slowing down by the lattice, and the elastic collisions between hot plasma H atoms and the cold H atoms. Creation, destruction, and sublimation Of WO(2), WO(3), HO, and H(2)O molecules at the W surface are described in terms of a simplified approach. The possible reduction of the chemical erosion due to the retained hydrogen isotopes is discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The number of pulses was from 2 to 10. The resultant erosion products were collected on a basalt filter and Si-collectors and studied in terms of morphology and size distribution using both scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Metal erosion products usually occurred in the form of spherical droplets, sometimes flakes. Their size distribution depended on the positioning of the collector. Simultaneously irradiated W, CFC and mixed W+Be targets appeared to have undergone a greater erosion than the same targets irradiated individually. Particles sized from 0.01 to 30 mum were found on collectors and on a molten W-surface. A model of droplet emission and behavior in shielding plasma is provided. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The JET Neutral Beam Injectors system does not reach the efficiency that is expected on the basis of current understanding of the neutralisation process. If this neutralisation efficiency deficit could be eliminated by re-design of the neutralisers, additional neutral beam heating power would become available. The interaction of the high-energy beam ions and the gas in the neutraliser cell results in the partial neutralisation of the beam and also in the formation of a low temperature plasma inside the neutraliser. The interaction between this plasma, the neutral gas and the walls of the cell can give rise to various phenomena capable of depleting the neutral gas molecular density hence reducing the effective neutralisation target. This paper presents the results of a number of experiments that were carried out in order to measure the plasma and gas parameters inside the neutraliser. The plasma parameters were obtained using a combination of planar Langmuir probes and a novel electrical diagnostic called a 'plasma eater'. The gas pressure was measured using hot cathode ionisation gauges and capacitance manometers. An attempt has been made to measure the neutral hydrogen gas temperature using a spectroscopic technique that requires the measurement of the intensities of the spectral lines of the hydrogen Fulcher-alpha system [Plasma Sources Sci. Technol. 10 (2001) 17]. (C) 2003 B. Crowley. Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Each injector has a single negative ion source connected to a 1 MV electrostatic accelerator. The accelerated negative ions pass through a neutraliser, then an electrostatic deflection system, where residual ions, exiting after neutralisation, are dumped. The neutral part of the beam continues to the torus through a duct connecting to the torus vessel. The 1 MV bushing is an insulated cylindrical, feedthrough (about 2 m in diameter and 2.5 m in height), which forms the physical boundary between the gas-insulated transmission line and the torus primary vacuum. An innovative design has been developed fulfilling all the requirements, including 1 MV class insulation in vacuum for a large number of services, vacuum compatibility, operation under neutrons and gamma radiation, safety requirements for pressure containment. In particular, the design allows a nitrogen pressurised guard volume that prevents any leakage of the external insulation gas (sulphur hexaflouride, potentially damaging for platinum/palladium catalysts of the tritium recovery system) inside the torus primary vacuum, and relieves the alumina insulator from substantial structural functions. The article describes the design, the selection of the materials and the mechanical analyses. To validate the design a reduced scale prototype, including all the relevant mechanical and electrical features of the bushing insulator, has been successfully manufactured and tested. The article reports all overview of this development. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

The torus window is the primary boundary of tritium and the vacuum confinement. The structure change of the diamond induced by energetic deuterium ion implantation was investigated using the X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) technique. It was found that the diamond structure changed to the graphite structure by not only deuterium ion implantation but also heating. The heating before the implantation changed the sp(3)-bonding structure of diamond to the sp(2)-bonding. The deuterium ion implantation was also found to induce graphitization and then the implanted deuterium was chemically trapped by carbon. Heating after the implantation, namely thermal annealing, induced the complete graphitization of the diamond. The sputtered sample, which had a smaller amount of oxygen on the surface than the as-received sample, was graphitized with smaller ion fluence than that for the as-received sample.

These data are essential to understand and model local and global particle fluxes and to make predictions for future devices like ITER. In spring 2000 the development of a new diagnostic, quartz microbalance (QMB), was started to measure quantitatively, in situ and time resolved (less than or equal to 1 s) the material deposition in the sub divertor region of JET. Calibration work of mass and temperature characteristic was done at FZ-Julich giving a layer mass sensitivity of Gamma(mass) = 7.5 x 10(-9) g/Hz and a temperature sensitivity of Gamma(temp)(100 degreesC) approximate to 0.09 degreesC/Hz. The commercially available QMB technique was adapted to the harsh constraints and requirements of JET. After implementation in March 2002 reliable and successful operation was demonstrated during the C5 campaign ( similar to 1000 plasma pulses). First examples of measurements are presented.

The nature of the fluids that are processed in detritiation requires the operation of the plant in maximum security conditions in order to protect the working staff and environment. The paper presents how the data acquisition and control system could be made for an experimental heavy water detritiation plant. The plant must be designed to be operated without any working staff in the technological space. The purpose of the security and control system is to ensure for the population an irradiation risk below the prescription limits. The radiological risk is the tritium leakage that can be gas, vapor or liquid. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The magnetic configuration is evaluated with an axisymmetric free-boundary equilibrium code, where the current profile is tailored to support an average beta of 10%. An injection current of 100 kA (125 MW of gun power) sustains the toroidal current of 40 MA. The magnetic flux linking the gun is 1/1000(th) of the flux in the spheromak. The geometry allows a flow of liquid, either molten salt, (flibe-Li(2)GBeF(4) or flinabe-LiNaBeF4), or liquid metal such as SnLi, which protects most of the walls and structures from damage arising from neutrons and plasma particles. The free surface between the liquid and the burning plasma is heated primarily by bremsstrahlung, line radiation, and some by neutrons. The temperature of the free surface of the liquid is calculated and then the evaporation rate is estimated from vapor-pressure data. The impurity concentration in the burning plasma, about 0.8% fluorine, is limited to that giving a 20% reduction in the fusion power. The divertor power density of 620 MW/m(2) is handled by high-speed (100 m/s) liquid jets. Calculations show the tritium breeding is adequate with enriched Li-6, and a design is given for the walls not covered by flowing liquid (similar to15% of the total). We identified a number of problem areas needing further study to make the design more self-consistent and workable, including lowering the divertor power density by expanding the flux tube size.

DESIGN	Due to its low vapor pressure, the Sn-Li eutectic has been identified as a potential breeder for deployment in the liquid first wall (FW)/Blanket concepts under investigation in the APEX study for high power density fusion reactors. However, its breeding capability is limited. This drawback is rather improved due to the neutron multiplication via Sn(n,2n) reactions. However, the "local" tritium breeding ratio (TBR) was found to be still on the marginal side (even with 90%Li-6 enrichment). Aside from using a beryllium multiplier, other means to improve the capability of Sn-Li for breeding ore explored. In this paper, we show that by isotopic tailoring of Tin in the Sn-Li breeder, one can achieve substantial improvement in TBR in addition to attaining significant reduction in the activation level in this material.

REMOTE HANDLING EQUIPMENT; WATER; DECONTAMINATION; DESORPTION; TRITIUM; TEMPERATURE; SURFACE	To investigate the hydrogen behavior in/on the Stainless Steel (SS 304, the deuterium or heavy water was sorbed on the sample by various methods, such as water adsorption, ion irradiation and electrolysis. and the chemical states of iron, chromium, nickel and oxygen studied by means of X-ray photoelectron,en were spectroscopy (XPS). It was found that the metal oxide and oxyhydroxide, FeOOD or CrOOD, were formed on the surface of SS-304. The oxyhydroxide was dominant on the surface of the sample charged by electrolysis. However, metal oxide was observed on the surface of SS-304 after D2O water adsorption. The thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) was also applied to the evaluation of the thermal desopition behaviors of D-2 and D2O from SS-304. It was found that three peaks were found in the sample charged with electrolysis. Among them, two peaks were also observed in the sample with water adsorption. The first peak, which was only found in the sample charged with electrolysis, suggests the 1), and DO release by the decomposition of oxyhydroxide, and the second peak was induced by the decomposition of hydroxide or aquo-iron complexes. The third deuterium release would be induced by the desorption of the dissociative absorbed deuterium. It was concluded that the existence and chemical form of oxygen influence the retention of deuterium on/in SS-304.

This article summarizes the results of the safety evaluation of the Evaporation of Lithium and Vapor Extraction (EVOLVE) W-alloy first wall (FW) and blanket concept(1). We have analyzed the EVOLVE design response during a confinement bypass accident. A confinement bypass accident was chosen because, based on previous safety studies(2), this accident can produce environmental releases by breaching the primary radioactive confinement boundary of EVOLVE, which is the EVOLVE vacuum vessel (VV). As a consequence of a bypass accident, air from a room adjoining the reactor enters the plasma chamber by way of a failed VV port. This air reacts with the high temperature metals inside of the VV to release energy in the case of a lithium spill, or to mobilize radioactive material by oxidation, and then transport this material to the environment by natural convection airflow through the failed VV port. We use the MELCOR code(3) to analyze the response of EVOLVE during this accident. Based on these results, the EVOLVE concept can meet the no-evacuation dose goal set by the DOE Fusion Safety Standard(4) if the EVOLVE confinement building ventilation system is closed within two hours of the onset of this accident.

Heavy ion beam driven inertial fusion energy (IFE) power plants employ liquid wall materials to protect the structure against the energetic x-rays, ions, and debris emitted from the target following each shot. The objective of this assessment is to identify the radiological issues of the candidate liquid wall materials (Pb, LiPb, Sn, and Flibe) using the ARIES-IFE radiation chamber environment. The issues to be addressed include the radioactivity level and liquid waste minimization for waste management. Specifically, the liquids are evaluated with regard to the Class C limitation for waste disposal, a top-level requirement for all ARIES power plant designs. Two extreme cases were analyzed; the worst case is separation of the liquid wall material (highest radiation exposure) and the breeder (lowest radiation exposure), and the best case is the mixing of the two liquid streams. Both tangential and porous wall injection schemes were examined. Pb and LiPb are more radioactive than Sn and Flibe. For the liquid breeder system, the porous wall injection scheme with mixed liquid flows results in the lowest waste disposal rating and smallest waste stream achieved in our study.

ISOTOPE-SEPARATION; CONTINUOUS FEED; DRAW-OFFS	The pressure dependence of separation factors of the columns for H-2-HT mixture was measured for practical design of "cryogenic-wall" thermal diffusion columns for tritium handling system. Experiments were performed with 1, 020 mm-height column with a 4.8 mm-outer-radius tube heated by hot-water and a 11.5 mm-inner-radius tube cooled by liquid nitrogen. The maximum total separation factor was 12.7 at 80 kPa for H-2-HT separation. By using another column with 9.53 mm-outer-radius tube heated by hot-water and a 14.2 mm-inner-radius tube, the separation factor was 64.4 at 144 kPa, and the separation will be larger at higher pressure. Comparison of numerical calculations of axial and radial two-dimensional flow and concentration distribution with experimental data revealed that our code could predict the pressure dependence of separation factor of the columns well.

BORONIZATION; FILMS; GRAPHITE	To study chemical behaviors of energetic deuterium implanted into boron coating deposited by boronization in fusion devices, two types of boron coating film deposited on silicon and IG430U were prepared by Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition (PCVD) technique. Boron polycrystal was used as the reference sample. The chemical behavior of deuterium was investigated by XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) and TDS (Thermal adsorption spectroscopy). The 1.0 keV D-2(+) ions were implanted into the samples and the deuterium desorption behavior was studied by TDS. The TDS spectra showed that there were two deuterium release peaks at around 550 and 750 K which were attributed to the release from deuterium trapped by boron and carbon, respectively. It was also found that most of implanted deuterium was trapped in carbon trapping site compared with boron one. In XPS measurements, the chemical shift of B-Is towards positive side was observed in the film on IG430U after D-2(+) ion implantation. However, no chemical shifts were found in the film on silicon and boron polyctystal. In highly concentrated boron materials, even if deuterium was implanted into the boron materials, the amount of B-D bond was too low to be measured by XPS. This suggests that deuterium implanted into highly pure boron materials wasn't almost trapped, so that the retention of deuterium in the boron materials would be reduced, compared that in carbon materials.

NEUTRAL BEAM INJECTION; LARGE HELICAL DEVICE; SYSTEM	Two pilot facilities of advanced negative-ion-based neutral beam injection heating system have been working successfully on the JT-60U tokamak and the LHD heliotron in Japan. These were the first applications of negative-ion technology to the production of high current neutral beam for plasma heating as well as current drive. High energy deuterium beam of 400 keV (5.8 MW) was injected in JT-60U for efficient current drive, and high power hydrogen beam of 9.0 MW (160 keV) was injected in LHD producing high performance plasmas. These results demonstrate the feasibility of negative ion beam system for future fusion reactors such as ITER.

He fusion reaction can be used to produce medical radioisotopes. Steady-state D-(3) He operation is possible using Inertial Electrostatic Confinement (IEC); however, the location of the reactions must be known to use them effectively for isotope production. In the University of Wisconsin IEC Device, it has been found that as much as 213 of the total D-(3) He reaction rate can be due to embedded fusion reactions, reactions occurring within the cathode due to ion implantation. Therefore, the cathode surface sees a large, high-energy proton flux. Using a solid molybdenum cathode, and taking advantage of the embedded reactions, about 1 nCi of the medical isotope Tc-94m was created via Mo-94(p,n)Tc-94m in a proof of principle experiment. This represents the first time the IEC concept has been used to produce a radioisotope using D-He-3 fusion.

This radioisotope is often used in positron emission tomography scans to image the heart. The 10-minute half-life of N-13 limits its use to those areas and clinics that possess an accelerator. A portable IEC device could be brought to remote locations, however, and produce short-lived PET isotopes on-site. Using the 14.7 MeV protons produced from the D-He-3 fuel cycle, the University of Wisconsin IEC device was used to produce approximately 4 - 8 Bq of N-13 during two separate experiments.

TRANSMUTATION; REACTOR	A fusion based actinide destruction system is advantageous because of higher actinide destruction efficiency and higher energy efficiency when compared to other destruction technologies. The unique neutron multiplication capability due to the n,2n reactions in blanket materials with 14 Me V D-T neutrons enhances further the performance efficiency. Investigation of a high performance fusion based actinide destruction system was conducted A self-cooled, actinide-carrying molten salt blanket can be designed to operate at a high sub-criticality factor of 0.95-0.96, with less than 0.4 wt% actinide concentration dissolved in the molten salt. The corresponding blanket energy multiplication is 160. Lithium-6, which is required for tritium breeding, can be used as a variable to shape the neutron spectrum and control the criticality factor, and thus to maintain a constant fission thermal power output from the actinide destruction plant. Sub-criticality can be maintained in all cases of the actinide destruction plant, during normal operation and abnormal conditions. A fusion device projected from a tokamak experiment can produce 30 MW fusion power, with a plasma amplification factor of 2. It is considered adequate to drive the sub-critical molten salt blanket. The total thermal fission power is about 4000 MW which is able to destroy 1.6 metric tons of actinides annually when operating at full power.

OPPORTUNITIES	A major effort to find near-term, non-electric applications of fusion energy has shown that the production of radioisotopes is attractive. The use of the (DHe)-He-3 fusion reaction to produce Positron Emission Tomography (PET) isotopes is described. An Inertial Electrostatic Confinement (IEC) device is particularly well suited to produce low levels of high-energy (14.7 MeV) protons, which in turn, can produce short-lived PET isotopes. The IEC device at the University of Wisconsin has been modified to investigate the potential of this process to be commercially attractive.

J	Stannard, JN				Stannard, JN			The concepts of critical organ and radiation dose as applied to plutonium	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Reprint							WORKERS; PU-239	The concepts of critical organ or tissue and the calculation of radiation dose have been and may well continue to be central to the development of standards for most radionuclides. In the case of plutonium the occupational standard was based on a modification of the direct calculations of maximum permissible annual dose (MPAD) or dose rate but critical organs must still be chosen for different routes of entry and different compounds and for all of the derived standards. Changes in such standards by likely variations in metabolic parameters and models are shown to be significant but not large. Application of the critical organ concept to population exposure standards poses some new problems because the basic MPAD does not distinguish among organs. A simple scaling factor from occupational exposure standards thus is not satisfactory. Use of the concept of dose commitment has many advantages but it is still necessary to select a critical organ and calculate dose. By-passing some of the problems in present practices by using risk-estimates seems unlikely for plutonium it the present time because of the paucity of human effects data and the fact that the animal experiments used quite different dosage regimens from the likely exposure situations to plutonium.

J	Scott, BR; Peterson, VL				Scott, BR; Peterson, VL			Risk estimates for deterministic health effects of inhaled weapons grade plutonium	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						radiation, ionizing; plutonium; risk estimates; Monte Carlo	PARTICLE-EMITTING RADIONUCLIDES; LUNG-CANCER; NUCLEAR ENTERPRISE; MAYAK WORKERS; BEAGLE DOGS; RADIATION; HUMANS	Risk estimates for deterministic effects of inhaled weapons-grade plutonium (WG Pu) are needed to evaluate potential serious harm to (1) U.S. Department of Energy nuclear workers from accidental or other work-place releases of WG Pu; and (2) the public from terrorist actions resulting in the release of WG Pu to,the environment. Deterministic health effects (the most serious radiobiological consequences to humans) can arise when large amounts of WG Pu are taken into the body. Inhalation is considered the most likely route of intake during work-place accidents or during a nuclear terrorism incident releasing WG Pu to the environment. Our current knowledge about radiation-related harm is insufficient for generating precise estimates of risk for a given WG Pu exposure scenario. This relates largely to uncertainties associated with currently available risk and dosimetry models. Thus, rather than generating point estimates of risk, distributions that account for variability/uncertainty are needed to properly characterize potential harm to humans from a given WG Pu exposure scenario. In this manuscript, we generate and summarize risk distributions for deterministic radiation effects in the lungs of nuclear workers from inhaled WG Pu particles (standard isotopic mix). These distributions were developed using NUREG/CR-4214 risk models and time-dependent, dose conversion factor data based on Publication 30 of the International Commission on Radiological Protection. Dose conversion factors based on ICRP Publication 30 are more relevant to deterministic effects than are the dose conversion factors based on ICRP Publication 66, which relate to targets for stochastic effects. Risk distributions that account for NUREG/CR-4214 parameter and model uncertainties were generated using the Monte Carlo method. Risks were evaluated for both lethality (from radiation pneumonitis) and morbidity (due to radiation-induced respiratory dysfunction) and were found to depend strongly on absorbed-dose-rate history (which depends on WG Pu solubility). The results obtained were compared to new data from animal and epidemiological studies. Our findings suggest that NUREG/CR-4214 models for assessing lethality risk from inhaled radionuclides may need some modest revision in light the new data. However, for assessing morbidity risks, major revisions may be needed.

Thus, a major objective of the present work is to characterize the effluent from La Hague reprocessing plant and to study how the radionuclide speciation changes with time when discharged into the marine environment. Discharges from the La Hague nuclear reprocessing plant represent an important source of artificially produced radionuclides to the North Sea. The transport, distribution, and biological uptake of radionuclides in the marine environment depends, however, on the physicochemical forms of radionuclides in the discharged effluents and on transformation processes that occur after entering the coastal waters. Information of these processes is needed to understand the transport and long-term distribution of the radionuclides. In the present work, a weekly discharged effluent from the nuclear fuel reprocessing plant at Cap La Hague in France was mixed with coastal water and fractionated with respect to particle size and charged species using ultra centrifugation and hollow fiber ultrafiltration with on line ion exchange. The size distribution pattern of gamma-emitting radionuclides was followed during a 62-h period after mixing the effluent with seawater. Mn-54 was present as particulate material in the effluent, while other investigated radionuclides were discharged in a more mobile form or were mobilized after mixing with sea water (e.g., Co-60) and can be transported long distances in the sea. Sediments can act as a sink for less mobile discharged radionuclides (Skipperud et al. 2000). A kinetic model experiment was performed to provide information of the time-dependent distribution coefficients, K-d (t). The retention of the effluent radionuclides in sediments was surprisingly low (K-d 20-50), and the sediments acted as a poor sink for the released radionuclides. Due to the presence of non-reacting radionuclide species in the effluent, a major fraction of the radionuclides, such as Cs-isotopes, Ru-106 and Sb-125, in the effluent will be subjected to marine transport to the Northern Seas (i.e., the North Sea, Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea). The La Hague effluent may, therefore, contribute to enriched levels of radionuclides found in the English Channel, including Sr-90, Co-60 and Pu-isotopes, and also Ru-106 and Sb-125.

The complicated character of the problem is due to a number of issues, such as the very wide range of contamination, the presence of a mixture of radioactive isotopes, the highly variable diffusion of radionuclides in soil, water, and air, and the effect of climatic conditions. The resultant field has an irregular mosaic structure, which restricts the choice of measurement methods and data processing. In view of this, application of classical statistics techniques is often inappropriate in modeling such an environment. Application of the tools of fractal and stochastic geometry provides a good insight and helps to distinguish between distribution characteristics of natural and man-made isotopes. Several techniques are implemented to determine scaling aspects of contaminated fields. The discovery of multifractal scaling leads to the hierarchical structure of contamination spots on different scales and intensity and places restrictions on the measurement net for detecting anomalies. The method of stochastic geometry further demonstrates that topological characteristics of contamination fields differ from those of the Gaussian fields and the topology of man-made isotopes differs from natural ones.

It is also a risk for the population at large in case of intake of contaminated water or food. Uranium induces nephropathy that is characteristic of heavy metals, which can lead to death. The toxic effects of uranium can be prevented by a biphosphonate, ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-bisphosphonate (bisodic etidronate), administered orally or subcutaneously. Employing bisodic etidronate, our laboratory obtained satisfactory results in terms of survival in adult mice, adult rats, and suckling rats. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of bisodic etidronate for preventing renal dysfunction induced by a lethal dose of uranyl nitrate, employing serum levels of urea and creatinine as end-points. Two experiments were performed over different time periods, i.e., Experiment A: 48 h, Experiment B: 14 d. Each experiment was performed with 4 groups of 20 male Balb/c mice each, 25 g average body weight. Three of these groups received 350 mg kg(-1) of body weight of uranyl nitrate by gavage (forced oral administration). Two of the three exposed groups were treated with bisodic etidronate either by gavage in a dose of 500 mg kg(-1) body weight or with a subcutaneous injection of 50 mg kg(-1) body weight. The fourth group served as control. Survivors of the experimental groups were sacrificed at the end of the experiment by overdose of inhalation anesthetic (ether). The kidneys were routinely processed for histological analysis. Blood samples were taken by cardiac puncture to assess urea and creatinine serum levels. Urea and creatinine serum levels were markedly lower at 48 h in exposed animals treated with bisodic etidronate than in untreated exposed animals. On day 14 these values in exposed and treated animals did not differ significantly from control values. The renal function of animals treated with orally or subcutaneous bisodic etidronate that survived uranyl nitrate exposure was markedly improved compared to the controls of untreated exposed animals at 48 h. At 14 days, treatment with bisodic etidronate averted renal damage. At this time, the histologic study of kidneys showed images of tissue recovery. These results suggest that the use of EHBP may be of great value in reducing the renal damage.

This study is a comparison between molecular sieve and silica gel adsorbent media used for atmospheric moisture sampling conducted in the semi-arid climate of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. Water vapor was collected simultaneously using two columns containing different desiccant materials (one column containing molecular sieve and the other containing silica gel). Data collected during air sampling periods were compared With meteorological data collected, and atmospheric moisture collection efficiencies were determined. Breakthrough of atmospheric moisture past the desiccant material was suspected with both media at elevated temperatures indicating that smaller sample volumes, lower volumetric flow rates, or longer adsorbent columns should be used during summer when ambient temperatures are elevated.

This study compared exposure rates measured using electret ion chambers with gamma spectroscopic analysis results of soil samples collected at the remediated site. Exposure rate measurements were made in 1999 using electret ion chambers at the same locations that INEEL Oversight Program sampled soil in 1998 following MARSSIM protocol. The waste site was divided into nine survey units based upon site history including previous site surveys and physical boundaries. Exposure rate measurements at the remediation site compared well with exposure rate measurements made at reference background locations used for routine environmental monitoring by the State of Idaho indicating that the remedial action met cleanup criteria. A poor correlation between exposure rate measurements and Cs-137 concentrations and other discrepancies were observed during this study with respect to measurements made during the 1998 final site survey.
