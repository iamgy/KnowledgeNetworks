J	Sanchez, G; Lopez-Fidalgo, J				Sanchez, G; Lopez-Fidalgo, J			Mathematical techniques for solving analytically large compartmental systems	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						modeling, biological factors; biokinetics; radiation protection; dose, internal		The flow of radioactive particles inside the body from internally deposited radioisotopes in people exposed to inhalation, ingestion, injection, or other ways is usually evaluated using compartmental models. The biokinetic models included in the documents of the International Commission on Radiological Protection such as International Commission on Radiological Protection 66 and 78 involve many compartments. Usually numeric methods are applied. Very often analytical solutions are not possible. New computer programs that include symbolic capability can be used to solve compartmental systems. In this paper some techniques are developed in order to make feasible a computer program that gives not only faster and more accurate solutions, but also analytic solutions for these kind of models. The main idea is to make a partition of subsystems and solve them sequentially. The concept of pseudotrap compartments in a subsystem is crucial at this point. Impulse (acute), constant, and continuous (such as exponential) intakes are considered. This technique has been applied to develop a computer code called Humorap to solve the International Commission on Radiological Protection 66 and 78 models.

The authors have previously reported H-3 concentrations in diet samples collected in Akita Prefecture during 1969-1988. Serum samples from persons living in Akita Prefecture during 1969-1992 were recently obtained. The samples were originally gathered for medical examinations and stored in freezers at -20degreesC. Composite samples from 100 persons on average were made for analysis. The free water H-3 (FWT) concentrations in those samples were determined and compared with H-3 concentrations in diet samples and precipitation. The long-term variation pattern of the FWT concentrations in the, serum samples was similar to patterns in the diet samples and precipitation, but the FWT concentrations in the serum samples were slightly higher than those in the latter two. A single compartment model calculation showed that the apparent mean residence time of serum FWT was 1.4 y using precipitation as an input to the compartment.

Large ranges of concentration and isotopic composition were studied on urine samples excreted by occupationally exposed workers. The results were consistent with those obtained by fluorimetry and by alpha spectrometry after a purification procedure, two currently used techniques. However, the proposed procedure is limited for determination of the minor isotope U-234. Thus for worker monitoring, the conversion of U-234 mass concentration into activity concentration can lead to an erroneous value of the effective dose, in particular for a contamination at very low level with highly enriched uranium. A solution to avoid this hazard is to perform a chemical purification prior to ICP-MS measurement to lower uncertainty and detection limit for U-234.

This is particularly true for natural uranium. Two techniques have been developed by the Human Monitoring Laboratory to reduce the Minimum Detectable Activity (MDA) for the lung counting of this nuclide. The first technique, developed in collaboration with Cameco, is to either sum sequential counts of an individual or to sum spectra of a group of workers similarly occupationally exposed. This technique offers a reduction in the MDA of up to a factor of three. The second technique, developed in collaboration with CNEN, involves the summing of photopeaks within an individual spectrum and offers a reduction in the MDA of up to a factor of two.

The uranium concentration was determined in food, drinking water, and other beverages. Uranium concentration was also determined in a "total diet" sampled in 1999. The total daily dietary intake was estimated to be in the range 2.9-4.8 mug d(-1). The contribution of drinking water to the total uranium intake is sometimes significant as the uranium concentration range in 29 analyzed tap and bottled "mineral" waters is 0.04-5.86 mug L-1 and the drinking water consumption about 1 L d(-1) or more. Data obtained in this study were compared with data from literature on the uranium daily intake in other countries. Urine samples were collected from 24 male and 14 female occupationally unexposed subjects, 20-50 y of age, living and working in the district of Rome (Italy). The mean concentration found was 10 +/- 7.0 ng L-1; the inter-subject variability and the daily variability was evaluated. Analyses were performed using ICP-MS.

J	Emery, RJ; McCrary, JR				Emery, RJ; McCrary, JR			Effectively displaying broad scope sub-licensee radioactive material inventory allocations and possession quantities	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topic; radiation protection; quality assurance; radioactive materials	TEXAS	As part of its annual broad scope license radiation protection program review, the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston radiation safety program discovered that although inventory control and monitoring mechanisms were being effectively implemented at the sublicensee level, a method did not exist to demonstrate compliance with collective broad scope license possession limits at the institutional level. To address this shortcoming, the radiation safety program data warehouse system was modified, and an automatic summary report showing collective sub-licensee maximum possession authorizations was created. But this report did not effectively present the summary information in a manner that key stakeholders could readily comprehend, as the data was not referenced to collective institutional possession limits. So a graphic version of the summary report was created wherein, for each isotope possessed, the collective institutional limit was displayed, along with the totals of all the individual sub-licensee maximum possession limits and current amounts on hand. This simple graphic served to effectively communicate the current status of the institution's radiation source inventory to the radiation safety committee, executive management, and state regulatory officials. The effort has served to simplify the sometimes-complicated source inventory control process and has facilitated subsequent program reviews. In the future, the method is expected to assist the radiation protection program in anticipating when broad license amendments may be needed to accommodate operational changes.

J	Leidholdt, EM; Williams, GE; McGuire, EL				Leidholdt, EM; Williams, GE; McGuire, EL			A reassessment of radioactive material security in health care and biomedical research	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topic; radioactive materials; medical radiation; radiation protection		The medical facilities of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) use radioactive material for health care and biomedical research. In the past, a single level of security for all radioactive material was generally deemed to be adequate. The events of 11 September 2001 prompted a reassessment of security. Based on site visits to VA facilities possessing a range of radioactive material typically used in health care and biomedical research, the VA National Health Physics Program has compiled recommendations for the security of radioactive material. A primary recommendation is to evaluate radioactive material from a risk perspective and use security measures commensurate with risk. The risk evaluation should consider activity, half-life, exposure rate constant, ALI, ease of removal/portability, and dispersibility. We concluded that current security measures are likely adequate for the risks associated with most nuclear medicine departments and biomedical research laboratories. However, for radioactive material of higher risk, particularly multicurie sources of long half-life, the radiation safely staff should consult with police/security experts to determine if additional security measures are warranted. This focus on risk should help optimize resource allocation. We also recommend that security evaluations consider both physical security and personnel security, training of staff with unescorted access to higher-risk radioactive material emphasize security issues, and disposal of higher-risk material not likely to be used. Finally, we note that the goals of security can be in conflict with hazard awareness and hazard communication.

J	Pay, S				Pay, S			Determination of tritium and C-14 concentration in two hydrostratigraphic units below the University of California, Davis, waste burial holes at the Laboratory for Energy-Related Health Research/South Campus disposal site (LEHR/SCDS)	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article								The Laboratory for Energy-Related Health Research site at the University of California at Davis was used as a disposal site for tritium and C-14 waste generated by campus related research. This low-level radioactive waste was disposed of by shallow land burial from 1956 to 1974 in waste burial holes and resulted in extensive contamination of soils and groundwater at the LEHR/SCDS. In part, due to this contamination, the LEHR/SCDS was placed on the National Priority List in May of 1994. In 1999, soils in the vicinity of the waste burial holes were subject to a CERCLA Removal Action. To this day elevated tritium and C-14 concentrations are found in two groundwater monitoring wells that are located down gradient from the waste burial holes. The Bioscreen, Natural Attenuation Decision Support System software program was used, along with site-specific hydrogeologic conditions, to estimate the maximum source zone concentrations in the water bearing intervals below the waste burial holes. The first order decay process, and assumptions of horizontal flow provided reasonably accurate estimates of contaminant concentrations in the unconfined portion of the water bearing interval, but results for the confined portion of the water bearing intervals were mixed. Dose estimates for the time period of maximum contaminant concentration in the aquifer below the waste burial holes, predicted by modeling, suggested that the 4 mrem drinking water standard had not been exceeded at this site.

Since our radiation safety program must already meet strict state licensing requirements, the process of conforming to this standard was relatively easy to accomplish. The EH&S program achieved certification to the ISO 14001 standard in August of 2002. The benefits of the EMS include: better interaction between radiation safety and other EH&S program entities, holds all employees accountable by closely tracking program activities, presents a clear picture of program accomplishments to the university administration, allows for better use of limited resources and provides for continuous program improvement.

In order to apply this device to astrophysics, it is essential to investigate the radiation hardness and background properties induced by cosmic-ray protons in orbit. We irradiated Schottky CdTe diodes and a CdTe block with a beam of mono-energetic (150 MeV) protons. The induced activation in CdTe was measured externally with a germanium detector, and internally with the irradiated CdTe diode itself. We successfully identified most of radioactive isotopes induced mainly via (p, xn) reactions, and confirmed that the activation background level of CdTe diode is sufficiently low in orbit. We compared energy resolution and leakage current before and after the irradiation and also monitored the signals from a calibration source during the irradiation. There have been no significant degradation. CdTe diodes are tolerant enough to radioactivity in low earth orbit.

Dawn will determine the composition and structure of these protoplanetary bodies, providing context for a large number of primitive meteorites in our sample collection and a better understanding of processes occurring shortly after the onset of condensation of the solar nebula. The Dawn GR/NS design draws on experience from the successful Lunar Prospector and Mars Odyssey missions to enable accurate mapping of the surface composition and stratigraphy of major elements, radioactive elements, and hydrogen at both asteroids. Here, we describe the overall design of the GR/NS and compare the expected performance of the neutron spectrometer subsystem to the neutron spectrometer on Mars Odyssey. We also describe radiation damage studies carried out on CdZnTe detectors, which will be components of the primary gamma-ray spectrometer on Dawn. We conclude that provisions for annealing at moderate temperatures (40degreesC to 60degreesC) must be made to ensure that the spectrometer will function optimally over the nine-year mission.

The GEANT321 Monte Carlo simulation tool, originally developed at CERN for high energy physics experiments, is used for the evaluation and calibration of gamma nuclear gauges. A set of parameters, principally the source energy, the source-detector separation, the lead block thickness and the energy threshold below which the sediments elemental composition affects the measurement or the energy corresponding to the Compton and, photoelectric windows separation, are discussed and evaluated in the case of the gamma scattering gauge. For the gamma transmission gauge, the GEANT321 code has been used to define the optimal source detector distance interval, particularly for the Moroccan sediment, samplers, and to pension, check the influence of the radio,nuclei existing in the sus on the gauge response accuracy. Experimental calibration was also carried out using gamma transmission gauge, a good agreement was found between experimental and simulated results.

An analytical solution for the concentration and permeation flux as a function of time is given for permeation through the asymmetric membrane having different conditions on the inlet and outlet sides. The features of the steady state and transient permeation are discussed. Comparison of calculations with an experiment on deuterium permeation through vanadium, which is available from literature, is performed. It has been demonstrated that the parameters, extracted from the measurements of the permeation rate in SLR are very uncertain. Even the calculations with opposite asymmetries can be equally well adjusted to the experiment. Non-zero initial conditions in SLR experiments are additional source of uncertainty. Measurements of the accumulation in a closed volume instead of the permeation rate can seriously mislead in the interpretation of the experiment. Complementary experiments on permeation in two opposite directions and measurements of permeation decay could increase the reliability of the data obtained. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Standard enthalpies of formation, DeltaH(f)(0) at 298 K, for three brannerite compositions (kJ/ mol): CeTi2O6 (-2948.8 +/- 4.3), U0.97Ti2.03O6 (-2977.9 +/- 3.5) and ThTi2O6 (-3096.5 +/- 4.3) were determined by high temperature oxide melt drop solution calorimetry at 975 K using 3Na(2)O . 4MoO(3) solvent. The enthalpies of formation were also calculated from an oxide phase assemblage (DeltaH(f-ox)(0) at 298 K): MO2 + 2TiO(2) = MTi2O6, Only UTi2O6 is energetically stable with respect to an oxide assemblage: U0.97Ti2.03O6 (DeltaH(f-ox)(0) = -7.7 +/- 2.8 kJ/mol). Both CeTi2O6 and ThTi2O6 are higher in enthalpy with respect to their oxide assemblages with (DeltaH(f-ox)(0) = +29.4 +/- 3.6 kJ/mol) and (DeltaH(f-ox)(0) = +19.4 +/- 1.6 kJ/mol) respectively. Thus, Ce- and Th-brannerite are entropy stabilized and are thermodynamically stable only at high temperature. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effectiveness of Pd-coating was evaluated by activation temperature, at which Pd/ZrNi poisoned by air could be activated to absorb hydrogen. Characterization of Pd-coated ZrNi (denoted as Pd/ZrNi) by scanning electron microscopy, electron probe microanalysis and X-ray diffraction showed that a uniform Pd-coating layer was formed with the barrel-sputtering system. It was found that the poisoned Pd/ZrNi sample could be activated even at 423 K to absorb hydrogen at room temperature. This exhibits remarkable contrast to bare ZrNi, which could be only activated appreciably above 1073 K. It is concluded that the Pd-coating by barrel sputtering is quite effective to avoid the effect of surface poisoning of powdery hydrogen storage materials. However, the activation at excessively high temperature resulted in the loss of high activity to absorb hydrogen. It was concluded that this phenomenon was associated with reactions between Pd and ZrNi to form PdZr and other byproducts. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The neutron irradiation of Np-237 samples have been done at the Research Reactor Institute, Kyoto University (KUR). Samples of Np-237 were irradiated between two Cd sheets or without a Cd sheet. Since Np-237 has a strong resonance at the energy of 0.49 eV, the Cd cutoff energy was adjusted at 0.358 eV (thickness of the Cd sheets: 0.125 mm). A high purity Ge detector was employed for activity measurement. The reaction rate to produce Np-238 from Np-237 was analyzed by the Westcott's convention. Results obtained were 141.7+/-5.4 barns for sigma(0) and 862+/-51 barns for I-0 above 0.358 eV of Np-273. By setting the Cd cut-off energy at 0.358 eV considering the resonance at 0.49 eV, a smaller value of sigma(0) was obtained in this work than the values reported by the previous authors.

The results for the Bundle phase, involving an examination of bundle degradation and fission products release during SA conditions, were reported. Conclusions obtained from the analyses are as follows: (1) Temperature changes of fuel, cladding, and control rod were well predicted until about 12,000 s when almost all thermocouples measuring them failed. (2) Accumulated hydrogen generation due to Zr/steam reaction differed only about 3% from the test result. (3) Overall, good agreement was obtained for the fuel relocation and an accumulation of debris just below original spacer position was well predicted in the analysis. (4) Analysis of enhanced diffusion due to degraded fuel by Lewis et al.'s method enabled simulation of release behaviors of Xe, Cs, 1, and Te within the uncertainties in the test when the effective surface to volume ratio was changed in the evaluation of the UO2 oxidation. (5) Diffusion analysis through single-crystal grain could trace the release behavior of Mo, Sb, Tc, Ru, and Ba observed in the Phebus FPT1 test after optimizing their diffusion coefficients with the effective surface to volume ratio determined above.

Resulting from literature studies a combination of variable extraction steps for Y and Sr was chosen to be able for determining Sr-90 or Sr-89/-90 in a common as well as a rapid way. Measurements with a liquid-scintillation counter (LSC) and a low-background proportional counter (LBC) were Performed after the same chemical separation steps in each case to find out the detector which is the best suitable one for our requirements. Different steps of the analytical procedure are discussed in detail and its characteristic parameters are given.

The committed radiation dose is significantly dependent on the fraction of the ingested activity that crossed the gut wall (f(1) value). The directive 96/29/EURATOM has adopted f(1) values of 0.3 for adults. This study was aimed to investigate how far the calcium content of foodstuffs influences the uptake of ingested strontium. For aqueous solutions without calcium containing 1 mg strontium, f(1) values of 0.62 +/- 0.13 (mean +/- SD) were obtained. However, the uptake of 1 mg Sr from milk, and respectively from solutions with calcium was lower than from aqueous solution (f(1): = 0.32 +/- 0.06, respectively f(1): = 0.31 +/- 0.06). The data obtained show a significant reduction of the uptake of ingested strontium from milk in comparison to aqueous solution. The calcium content of milk could explain this reduction.

It could be shown that indeed initial criticality was possible due to the high U-235/U-238 enrichment of approximately 30% at that time. Furthermore, the U-238/Pu-239/U-235 conversion cycle guarantees also a stabilized U-235/U-238 enrichment of about 10% during the whole history of Earth. For this, a constant critical neutron flux in the realm of 10(8) n/(cm(2)s) has to be present to convert U-238 via the Pu-239 route and its ed-decay into U-235 with a conversion ratio of exactly unity. Herndon's georeactor is compared with other exotic fission reactors in Nature, too, but the decisive answer whether such a georeactor really exists needs further - particularly chemical, thermodynamical and geological - research work.

Excesses of childhood leukaemia near certain other nuclear installations in Britain were later reported during the 1980s, notably a cluster in west Thurso near Dounreay in Scotland. Detailed radiological investigations demonstrated that radiation exposures from discharged radioactive material were most unlikely to he the cause of these excesses and no serious deficiencies in these assessments hare been discovered despite exhaustive searches. In 1990, a report was published suggesting that occupational radiation exposure of men before the conception of their children could be responsible for the Seascale cluster. Extensive research has not supported a causal link between paternal preconceptional radiation (lose and childhood leukaemia, and the idea that radiation exposure of fathers materially increases the risk of leukaemia in offspring and could account for the clusters has now effectively been abandoned. In contrast, evidence has mounted that childhood leukaemia has an infectious basis and that unusual population mixing increases the risk of the disease. It now seems that population mixing is the explanation for the excesses of childhood leukaemia near nuclear sites and at other locations with no enhanced exposure to radiation.

The observations have been made on samples irradiated with 10.0 MeV/A U-238 ions (ion linear energy transfer similar to 30 keV/nm), and subsequently etched for 2-60 s in a 48% HF:glacial CH3COOH:FeF3 solution. The track core, having a mean diameter of 12.0 +/- 4.3 nm, is a highly reactive region, indicating the importance of a radiolytically decomposed zone. Etching of the surrounding track halo, a strained LiF crystal, is controlled by both radiation effects and surface energies of crystal faces. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Visualization of etched ARTs in dark mica by phase-contrast microscopy allows dating of Quaternary geological as well as archaeological materials. Visualization of etched ARTs by Nomarski-differential-interference-contrast microscopy (NDICM) and scanning force microscopy (SFM) enables the access to areal densities (rho(a)) of ART etch pits beyond 10(4) mm(-2) and thus the extension of the new ART-dating technique to an age range >1 Ma. The successful application of SFM as a new tool in geochronology could open the way to a field to be characterized as nanogeochronology. In order to visualize ARTs by NDICM and SFM, dark mica was etched with 4% HF at 21 degreesC for 5-107 min. A linear relationship between rho(a) and etching time (t(e)) was observed for phlogopites from the Kerguelen Islands (French territory, Indian Ocean), and the Kovdor magmatic complex (Russia). The volume density (rho(v)) of ART is a function of etching speed (v(eff)) and slope of the rho(a)-growth curve. The ART-age equation allows the calculation of an individual rho(v)-growth curve for the phlogopite analysed by us using the uranium and thorium content. The ART-ages were determined by combining the experimentally obtained volume density with the individual rho(v)-growth curve. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Geol. 166 (2000) 127, Science 155 (1967) 1103]. The age equation combines the volumetric density of ARTs with the U and Th contents. Etching latent ARTs (diameter 30-100 nm) in the mica mineral phlogopite by HF and measuring the areal density of triangular etch pits by optical and scanning force microscopy (SFM) leads to a linear growth of ART areal density versus etching time. The ART volume density is a function of the slope of the areal density and the etching rate (v(eff)). Therefore, the determination of v(eff) is essential for the calculation of an age value. To determine the etching parameters such as etching efficiency and v(eff), phlogopite samples were irradiated with 80 keV Au ions. Irradiated surfaces were etched with 4% HF at 23 +/- 2 degreesC during successive time intervals and after each interval studied with SFM. The etching rate v(eff) was determined by different techniques. To evaluate the threshold of etchability. the energy losses of the An ions and alpha-recoil nuclei in phlogopite were calculated with the SRIM00 code. The etching efficiency of the An ion tracks was then used to predict the corresponding etching efficiency of the natural radioactive nuclei. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study showed that P(AAm-g-EDTA) hydrogels adsorb heavy metal ions such as UO22+ in the presence of Pb2+ and Cd2+ selectively at certain pH's. The external stimuli of pH, temperature and ionic strength play an important role on the adsorption behavior. Since a very sensitive electro-analytical technique, differential pulse polarography (DPP) was used for determination of UO22+ adsorbed onto hydrogels (0.1-3.2 mg/g dry gel) from 5.0 mg/l aqueous solution without interfering Pb2+ and Cd2+ at certain pH's. These hydrogels can be used directly as UO22+ selective adsorbent for water and environmental pollutants without any pre-concentration techniques. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Single-grain dating protocols are expected to allow a detailed examination of the dose distribution in a sample; although the equivalent doses are measured for individual grains, the dose rate is usually assumed to be homogeneous and is obtained from bulk measurements. Then, if an asymmetric dose distribution is observed, it is usually attributed to incomplete bleaching or physical intrusion of older or younger gains. As part of our initial studies on the importance of spatial dose-rate variations, we report here on the first direct measurements to test the dose rate homogeneity in a natural sediment. alpha-Al2O3: C gains with diameters of 200-300 mum were mixed with a loess sediment and the doses to the single grains were measured. Additionally, the homogeneity of the gamma response of the grains was investigated. The results from 26 grains buried in the loess show a distribution with a standard deviation of 27%; this can be compared with a standard deviation of 20% measured using a gamma-irradiated sample, for which the dose should be homogeneous. We conclude that 18% of the dose variation is caused by dose-rate inhomogencities in the loess sediment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

It can be very important to provide a direct measurement of the contribution to dose rate from beta particles and gamma rays separately, especially when heterogeneity is on a scale comparable to the range of beta particles (a few mm). In the retrospective dosimetry of heterogeneous sites, in situ measurement at a point may be the only practical method of measuring the appropriate dose rate. Only if the beta and gamma contributions are measured separately can the appropriate water content and grain attenuation corrections be applied. Such corrections are also essential if the full potential of direct dose rate measurement in reducing the overall uncertainty in a luminescence age to much below 5% is ever to be realised. In this paper we outline the results of our modelling of the most appropriate encapsulation for Al2O3: C luminescence dosimeters when used to measure the dose rate from natural radiation fields. We consider a configuration where one Al2O3: C chip of a pair is enclosed in a beta-thin light-tight package (which would allow most of the beta radiation to reach the chip); the other in a beta-thick package (which would absorb most beta radiation, hence leaving the chip to record only gamma radiation). The design of the encapsulation is developed using Monte Carlo simulations, and this approach is also used to investigate the sensitivity of the response to the different beta and gamma contributions from uranium, thorium and potassium sources.

The ESR signal in montmorillonite immersed in GdCl3 solution was ascribed to Gd3+ observed at g = 2.0 with a width of 48 mT. This signal saturated with the concentration of GdCl3 solution from 0.01 to 0.1 mol/l. The ESR signal decayed with a lifetime of 750 s and different ESR signals at g = 5.6 and 2.9 appeared in isothermal annealing experiments at 150degreesC. These changes are caused by the change of the environment around Gd3+ ion to an anisotropic field due to dehydration and shrinkage of the montmorillonite structure. The adsorption of Gd3+ on hydroxyapatite (HAP) occurred via a cation exchange reaction and resulted in a broad signal with a width of 240 mT. The thermally stable Gd3+ signal in HAP also saturated with the concentration of the solution from 0.01 to 0.1 mol/l. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Broad Gaussian D-e distributions with relative standard deviations of 11-12% were observed. This was not expected, given the windblown nature of the deposits. This paper reports on a study on the causes of the broad dose distribution, using the quartz grains extracted from one of the samples from this coversand sequence. Investigations were made as to whether the spread might be related to the measurement procedures or to partial bleaching, but no evidence for these was found. The possibility of variations in microdosimetry was investigated by performing neutron activation analysis on small amounts (similar to 0.5-1 g) of sediment. A large scatter in U and Th concentrations throughout the profile was found. NAA of etched quartz extracts showed furthermore a non-negligible internal radioactivity. It is concluded that small-scale differences in the annual dose rate are the main cause for the observed distributions, although at this stage of our investigations it could not be established whether external or internal variations in microdosimetry are the dominant factor. The implications of our findings for dating these deposits are discussed in short. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The study has mainly been motivated by the need for high dose rates (similar to 1 Gy/s) to make dating of older samples using regeneration protocols more practical. Furthermore, X-ray generators are more suited for field work and work in countries where regulations restrict the use of radioactive sources. The system tested here (a 50 kV I mA Varian VF-50J tube with tungsten target and a matched Spellman high-voltage power supply) was found to provide: (i) excellent linearity between tube current (as set by the user on the control computer) and dose rate, (ii) a wide dynamic range: 2-30 mGy/s at 10 kV and 10-2000 mGy/s at 50 kV, (iii) short-term stability better than 0.2%, and (iv) a highly uniform irradiation of the sample area. Tests with a sample of thermally sensitized sedimentary quartz suggest that we can use beta and X-ray irradiation interchangeably from the point of view of construction of growth curves by the single-aliquot regenerative-dose protocol.

J	Notari, C				Notari, C			Neutronic optimization of PHWR fuel	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								The PHWR fuel element optimization in argentine NPPs is considered from a neutronic perspective. The requirements related to the use of slightly enriched uranium in reactors originally designed to operate in the natural uranium fuel cycle, with increased exit burnups and increased residence time in the core, are better faced with thinner rods in a rod-dense bundle. A 52 rod bundle, currently under development, is analized and an improvement of a 48 rod bundle is proposed. Cell and complete core calculations are performed in order to establish the achievable exit burnup and to determine how far the fuel management strategy used in the natural uranium case has to be modified in order to satisfy the restrictions imposed by the thermalhydraulic limits in Atucha I reactor. The improvement in the void coefficient, which is always an important topic in these reactors, is examined in order to show that all the fuel elements considered give place to a negative void coefficient with an adequate combination of enrichment and absorbers in the bundle.

Several limitations were recognised in this set. Two new sets IGC-S2 (100n, 21 gamma) and IGC-S3 (175n, 42 gamma) have been created and validated at IGCAR, based on ENDF/B-VI (5). Comparison of the results of two-dimensional transport calculations using DLC-37, IGC-S2 and IGC-S3 is presented in this paper, for PFBR. Since the activation of secondary sodium in the Intermediate Heat Exchanger (IHX) depends significantly but differently on the axial and radial neutron fluxes leaking from the core, 2-D transport calculations with reasonable orders for the anisotropy and angular quadrature are necessary. The effects of anisotropy in the scattering cross sections and the S-N order, on the shield parameters are studied with IGC-S2. It is found that 175-group calculations clearly predict the finer details of the neutron spectrum in the sodium pool and would facilitate more accurate shield design of PFBR.

J	Kim, YS; Jeon, SH; Jung, CH				Kim, YS; Jeon, SH; Jung, CH			Fluorination reaction of uranium dioxide in CF4/O-2/N-2 r.f. plasma	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								Research on the fluorination reaction Of UO2 in CF4/O-2/N-2 r.f. plasma is carried out under 0.3 Torr total gas pressure. The reaction rates are investigated as functions of the CF4/O-2/N-2 ratio, plasma power, substrate temperature, and exposure time to the plasma. It is found that there exists an optimum CF4/O-2 ratio of around four for the efficient etching, regardless of the r.f. power and substrate temperature. The reason that the etching reaction rate reaches the maximum at the optimum gas composition is explained, by the optical emission spectroscopy (OES) results showing that fluorine atoms are produced most abundantly in the 80%CF4/20%O-2 discharge plasma. The highest etching reaction rate at 370 degreesC under 150 W exceeds 1000 mono-layers/min, which is equivalent to 0.4 mum/min. According to the mass spectrometric analysis, the major reaction product turns out to be uranium hexa-fluoride UF6. Based on the experimental findings, the dominant overall reaction of uranium dioxide in the plasma is determined as UO2 + 3/2 CF4 + 3/8 O-2 = UF6 + 3/2 (CO or CO2). It is found that this reaction seems to follow a linear kinetics with the activation energy of 12.1 kJ/mol. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirms UO2F2 formation on the surface during the reaction and the two step reaction paths: UO2 --> UO2F2 --> UF6. Experimental results in the CF4/O-2/N-2 discharge plasma show that the reaction rate enhances with the addition of the third gas in the binary plasma. The ratio of the reaction rate in the ternary to that in the binary plasma saturates twice as much when the volumetric flow rate of the gas reaches 5% flow rate of CF4. It is also found that the reaction rates increase in a linear proportion to the applied plasma power in both the binary and ternary gas discharges and the proportionality in the ternary gas plasma is larger than that in the binary one.

A radiochemical production campaign was therefore undertaken to purify. 1500 Ci of Sr-90 that had been isolated from fission waste materials. A series of alkaline precipitation steps removed all detectable traces Of Cs-137, alpha emitters, and uranium and transuranic elements. Technical obstacles such as the buildup of gas pressure generated upon mixing large quantities of acid with solid Sr-90 carbonate were overcome through safety features incorporated into the custom-built equipment used for Sr-90 purification. Methods are described for analyzing the chemical and radiochemical purity of the final product and for accurately determining by gravimetry the quantities of 90Sr immobilized on stainless steel filters for future use.

Due to its short half-life, a fraction f of Po-218 decays before deposition onto available inner surfaces of the chamber, and the deposition fraction (1-f) represents the part which decays. after deposition. In the present work, f has been experimentally determined for six diffusion chambers with different materials and dimensions using the radial distribution of track density on the LR115 detectors inside the diffusion chambers. For all the six studied diffusion chambers, f was found to be similar to0.4. Therefore, the deposition fraction does not depend on the shape and dimensions of the diffusion chambers, the surface to volume ratios or the internal surface materials of the diffusion chambers.

This means that 7.5 VVER reactors (CUF = 0.85) must be maintained simultaneously for fuel storage time 30 yr (for a 3-yr fuel storage period, the number of VVER reactors maintained increases to 25). In the entire period of operation of the system, a substantial quantity of plutonium from the spent fuel is used - about 150 metric tons (with total plutonium production in VVER reactors of about 200 metric tons) and about 38 metric tons of fissioning isotopes are burned. Therefore, with up to 98% burnup of americium in the target material the conversion coefficient defined as the ratio of the mass of the americium annihilated to the mass of the spent fissioning material is about 0.57.

To reduce the amount of liquid radioactive wastes substantially at the Smolensk nuclear power plant, a technology has been developed for removing radionuclides from the regeneration solutions, including mixing of acidic and alkaline regeneration solutions with pH up to 9-10. Copper and iron cations and other ions undergoing hydrolysis, which are present in acidic regenerate as an impurity, precipitate as hydroxides on neutralization by an alkaline regenerate. Cobalt and manganese coprecipitate partially together with the hydroxides. After a holding period, the clarified or filtered solution reaches a stage of ion-selective purification using the radiation-resistant inorganic sorbents Termoksid-3 and Termoksid-35. The filtrate, having a total activity much less than 3(.)10(-10) Ci/liter, is reprocessed as a nonradioactive solution of the salt NaNO3. The results of service-life tests of the technology are presented.

The total individual accumulated absorbed dose is 50-490 mGy. For 18 of the 42 individuals examined, the dose exceeds 200 mGy. It is found that the protective countermeasure (elimination of the family milk cows) taken in 1986 was ineffective, since in 1987 the villagers began to reacquire family cows. Measures are proposed for limiting the consumption of local contaminated food products. The computational methodology adopted, based on questioning the population and assessing the running radiation conditions, is verified by comparing with data from individual EPR dosimetry on tooth enamel for some of the individuals examined (10 samples).

J	Jacq, F				Jacq, F			Waste management - A key to acceptance: Status of existing surface waste repositories and of research on HLLL waste disposal in France	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			English	Article								Managing radioactive waste constitutes a vital concern for the various users of radioactivity, relevant authorities and public opinion. Two particularly important elements for that management involve existing surface industrial facilities for the management of very low level, intermediate and low level and the ongoing investigations dealing with high-level long-lived waste. In the case of intermediate and low level short-lived waste, a well-performing surface industrial facility is already implemented in the Aube Department. It was commissioned in 1992 and superseded the former Centre de la Manche. The new facility, with a disposal capacity of 1 million cubic metres has demonstrated its industrial maturity and its ability to accommodate waste packages with flexibility, but without neglecting a constant concern for the environment. In the summer of 2003, it will be expanded in order to include a facility for very-low-level waste. As for high-level long-lived waste, investigations are regulated by the Act of 30 December 1991 prescribing three research areas (partitioning and transmutation; geological disposal, and storage and conditioning). Disposal investigations are conducted by Andra. Two types of formations are under study, clay and granite, with a view to presenting in 2005 a report to the government for decisions to be taken in 2006 on future waste-management guidelines. In the case of clay, Andra relies on a site that has been selected in Bure in Eastern France. In 2001 a summary report was prepared and is currently undergoing an international peer review. With regard to granite, investigations are based on a generic approach and co-operative efforts with foreign partners. Radioactive-waste management constitutes an issue of particular interest in France. The main objective is to ensure the availability of reliable and robust management solutions capable of protecting human beings and the environment against any contact with the waste.

J							Internationale Landerkommission Ke	ILK statement about the proposed EU directives on nuclear safety and the management of radioactive waste	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								In November 2002, the European Commission proposed a package of measures for a community concept of the EU on nuclear safety. It includes a proposed directive on the safety of nuclear installations during operation and decommissioning, and a proposed directive on the management of radioactive waste. In the opinion of the International Nuclear Committee (ILK), the competences and obligations of the member states and their safety authorities must be preserved in the future. Primary responsibility for plant safety rests with the operator. This objective is served by transparent, harmonized EU-wide safety standards. New standards and definitions are not generally required. Harmonized safety standards to be developed should initially be limited to nuclear power plants because of the fundamental differences in design of nuclear facilities. The Commission should obtain the technical competence required to perform the duties arising from the application of this proposed directive. Formal inspections by the Commission of the national regulatory authorities are not necessary. Instead, a peer review process will be the better solution. A reporting system at three-year intervals is generally regarded as the most effective approach. The ILK considers the tight schedule for final storage, especially of high level waste, problematic. Joint repository projects, also for countries with low waste arisings, are suitable approaches. The envisaged reports about the state of radioactive waste management should be integrated into the reporting systems under other international agreements. The Commission's intention to intensify cooperation in the field of research is welcomed.								*EUR KOMM, 2002, GEN EN VERK GEM NUKL; *EURATOM, 1957, VERTR GRUND EUR AT E; *INT AT EN ORG, 1994, UB NUKL SICH; *INT AT EN ORG, 1997, GEM UB SICH BEH ABG; *INT LAND KERNT, 2001, ILK STELL WIED ABG B; *INT LAND KERNT, 2002, ILK EMPF DURCHF INT; *INT LAND KERNT, 2000, ILK STELL ENDL RAD A	7	0	0	0	0	VERLAGSGRP HANDELSBLATT GMBH	DUSSELDORF	POSTFACH 10 11 02, D-40002 DUSSELDORF, GERMANY	1431-5254			ATW-INT Z KERNENERG	ATW-Int.

J	[Anonymous]				[Anonymous]			2002: Performance of German nuclear power plants	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								The 2002 Annual Report of the "Nuclear Power Plant Operation" Technical Committee, the so-called ABE Committee, of VGB, the Association of German Operators of Large Power Plants, among other things contains data about the performance of the nuclear power plants operated in Germany. The nineteen nuclear generating units operated in Germany in 2002, with an installed capacity of 22,365 MWe (net) and 21,283 MWe (gross), respectively, converted a total of 164.8 billion kWh of nuclear power into electric power, and supplied 156.3 billion kWh (net), respectively. As a result of prolonged unplanned outages of some plants, this is approx. 6.4 billion kWh (gross) less than in the best year so far, 2001. The reliability of operation is underscored by the high average availability in terms of time of 86%. The indicators of technical safety in 2002 continue to be favorable. Releases of radioactive substances were very low, being far below the licensed levels. There were no accidents. Plant performance, safety-related events, important repair and backfitting measures are documented in the report. The ABE Committee of VGB PowerTech e. V has exchanged experience about the operation of nuclear power plants for more than thirty years. The operators of 36 nuclear power plants in Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland participate in this exchange.									0	0	0	0	0	VERLAGSGRP HANDELSBLATT GMBH	DUSSELDORF	POSTFACH 10 11 02, D-40002 DUSSELDORF, GERMANY	1431-5254			ATW-INT Z KERNENERG	ATW-Int.

When the present allowance for the loss is applied, the alpha particle flux to the wall can be as high as 2 x 10(18) m(-2) s(-1) in the reactor, eroding tungsten by similar to20 mum per year. The peak particle fluence over a 2-year operation cycle can reach 10(26) m(-2), probably being larger than a critical fluence for blister formation. The result suggests that, for the steady-state tokamak fusion reactor, we should introduce a new design methodology of determining an acceptable level of TF ripple on the basis of particle fluence to the wall, instead of the present one based on a tolerable heat flux.
