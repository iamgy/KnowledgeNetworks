Polluted sediments were collected in three sampling points in the Havana Bay. Sedimentation rates were estimated using two different radiometric approaches: the depth profiles of Cs-137 and Pb-210. The maximum activity Cs-137 might indicate the proximity of the 1964's. The unsupported Pb-210 has been measured to apply both the Constant Initial Concentration Method (CIC) and the Constant Rate of Supply Method (CRS) Dating Models. The results show values for sedimentation rate ranging from 0.2 up to 1.3 cm-y(-1) increasing with time which manifests the importance of the achievement of a project of dredging.

The leaching capacity of ammonium carbonate and nitric acid have been investigated, showing that (NH4)(2)CO3 leads to higher recovery. The maximum leaching efficiency is obtained using 0.5% ammonium carbonate, with a minimal thorium pick-up. A uranium recovery of 94% is obtained after three consecutive contact experiments in carbonate media. with minimal thorium uptake in the leachate. This process was applied to an actual plant stream, allowing the reduction of the U-233 alpha-activity from 5.64 to 0.3 muCi/g of thorium oxalate cake.

The strong complexation of HSs is of importance in the migration of radionuclies in geological media. Renewed interest in stability constants of complexes of radioelements and radionuclides with humic and fulvic acids has been generated by problems associated with the nuclide migration in the environment. Use of the ion exchange method for the determination of conditional stability constants of metal-HS complexes was examined and reviewed. The complexation of HS to metal ions cannot be described in rigorous mathematical terms because of the ill-defined nature of HSs in contrast with the complexation of single ligands. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of Schubert's and, Ardakani-Stevenson's, curve fitting methods were discussed. The great stabilities of HS complexes to rare earths (Yb(III), Tb(III), Eu(III), Gd(III)), americium(III), cobalt(II), uranyl(VI) and thorium(IV) were revealed.

J	Oufni, L				Oufni, L			Determination of the radon diffusion coefficient and radon exhalation rate in Moroccan quaternary samples using the SSNTD technique	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							NUCLEAR TRACK DETECTORS; CR-39	Measurements have been made of radon (Rn-222), release from diverse quaternary samples collected from different sediment deposits in the Errachidia and Beni-Mellal areas (Morocco). The radon diffusion coefficient as one of some important parameters of radon transport in the soil has been measured using solid state nuclear track detectors (SSNTD). Radon alpha-activity, uranium content and radon exhalation rate have been determined in the studied samples. Uranium concentrations were found to vary from 0.14 to 9.52 ppm whereas the radon exhalation rate varied from 0.003 to 0.145 Bq-m(-2)-h(-1). A positive correlation has been found between radon exhalation rate and uranium content in the studied samples. The average radon diffusion coefficients were found to vary from (1.26 +/- 0.09).10(-6) m(2).s(-1) to (4.3+/-0.36)-10(-6) m(2).s(-1). Furthermore, the correlation between Rn-222 diffusion coefficient and porosity are also discussed.

The rate equation of the reaction is determined as -d[V(V)]/dt=k[V(V)][DMH] by investigating the influence of the concentrations of V(V) and DMH, acidity, ionic strength and the ratio of the initial concentrations of reactants on the redox reaction. The rate constant of the reaction k = 9.95 +/- 0.52 (mol/l)(-1) . s(-1) when the ionic strength is 1.00 mol/l. The activation energy of the reaction is 22.1 kJ/mol. A possible mechanism of the redox reaction has been suggested on the basis of an electron spin resonance(ESR) spectrum of dimethyl nitroxyl radical, (CH3)(2)NO.

J	Chu, TC; Ko, FH; Hsu, CC				Chu, TC; Ko, FH; Hsu, CC			Application of a radioactive tracer method to copper migration in semiconductor lithography	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PLASMA-MASS-SPECTROMETRY; HYDROPHILIC SILICON SURFACES; PROCESS CHEMICALS; AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; METAL-IONS; CONTAMINATION; INTERFERENCES; ADSORPTION; WAFERS	Radioactive tracer technique was applied to examine the migration of Cu impurity from ArF and KrF photoresists onto silicon-based underlying substrates of Si(100), Si(110), Si(111), poly-Si, SiO2 and Si3N4. The effects of the polymer constituent in the photoresists and the baking temperature were studied. Results showed that the migration ratio of Cu from ArF photoresist was always exceeded that from KrF photoresist, independently of the substrate types and baking temperatures. The benzene ring in the KrF photoresist confined the Cu migration, while the alicyclic constituent in the ArF photoresist could not. The migration process of Cu from the bulk region into the interface region was discussed. The residual solvent in the bulk region influenced the Cu migration. The electronegativity of Cu explained the accumulation of Cu on wafer surface. Simple diffusion model was tried to explain the migration ratios, but the model did not explain it well due to the change of the photoresist medium during baking. A correlation function was proposed to modify the diffusion coefficient for describing the experimental observation of migration ratios.

Thorium isotopes in the reaction products were isolated and purified by anion exchange chromatography in a concentrated nitric acid medium to remove lanthanides fission products. The thorium fraction was further purified by samarium fluoride coprecipitation and the precipitate was mounted as a source for alpha-spectroscopy. Decaying alpha-signals were observed in the energy region that was expected for (229)mTh, i.e., between 4.83 and 5.08 MeV. The half-life of the decaying component was determined from repeated experiments to be 13.9+/-3 hours.

It was found that the lighter side of the heavier wing of asymmetric mass distributions shifts to larger fragment mass number corresponding to the N/Z value of the fissioning nucleus. The results are explained qualitatively by the change of the most probable mass number of fission fragments of Z = 50 proton-shell.

As a result, only Mg concentration showed similar, smooth decreasing tendency in both wood species. The smooth change of the Mg concentration across the annual rings along with the growth suggested the possibility of the Mg concentration determination as a promising dendrochronological tool.

J	Bronson, FL				Bronson, FL			Validation of the accuracy of the LabSOCS software for mathematical efficiency calibration of Ge detectors for typical laboratory samples	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								The LabSOCS software performs mathematical efficiency calibration of Ge detectors. Extensive tests have been conducted comparing the LabSOCS efficiency calibration with those from traditional radioactive sources for typical laboratory geometries. For this study, 4 NIST-traceable standards containing 13 different energy lines were counted in 7 different geometries that are typical of laboratory samples. The results from the first 13 detectors produced using this process show that efficiency calibrations generated with LabSOCS have an accuracy of 5.1% SD at low energies and 4.2% SD at high energies.

Daughter nuclides in natural decay series are found in an enrichment state from radioactive equilibrium. Unexpected contamination that had a ground water origin was supposed to explain the enrichment. This finding suggests strongly that alpha-spectrometry is still quite an important technique to evaluate soft-error probability for modern memory device materials since highly sensitive instrumental analysis such as ICP-MS is not sensitive enough to short-lived alpha-emitters.

Two Podsol soils, which have different radioactive deposition characteristics, have also been examined. Activity ratios of Pu-239,Pu-240/Cs-137, Sr-90/Cs-137, and Am-241/Cs-137 in the 0-1 cm layer of the two Podsol soils differed very much. Speciation of the radionuclides by sequential selective extraction was examined in the soils. Depth profiles of the soils have been analyzed according to the speciation results and soil characteristics.

Therefore, forest ecosystem plays a vital role in ultimate fate of radionuclides and carbon cycle in terrestrial environment. In this study, three undisturbed forest soil profiles were collected from Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. The Cs-137 data illustrate that maximum fallout deposition of Cs-137 took place around 1964. C-14 determination shows that C-14 also has peak values in the top 10 cm of the soil profiles ascribed to the highest bomb C-14 level in 1960's. The C-13 data show that the turnover dynamics of soil organic carbon could be described very well by progressive enrichment values of delta(13)C.

It was shown that the thermal annealing process of the damages consisted of two processes of a fast and a slow process. The activation energies were determined to be 0.21 eV and 1.1 eV, respectively. From the experimental results, it was suggested that the migration of tritium and displaced oxygen into the damages plays an important role in both thermal annealing processes.

Two examples were examined: (1) in the apatite-bearing sediment column samples U(VI) is moving, while U(IV) in the samples is almost retained, and (2) the redistribution of U occurred along the column under the monsoon climate. On the other hand, U in the conglomerate sample is divided into 5 categories by the leaching technique, which are related with exchangeable, carbonate, iron oxide, organic/sulfide and silicate components, respectively.

Re was concentrated from 420925 ml river water using a TEVA resin minicolumn. Such extraction using a resin could separate Re from most sample matrices and trace elements. Almost 100% recovery was found throughout the method as determined with radioactive multitracers. The HR-ICP-MS was also used for the direct determination because of its low detection limit for Re (0.007 pg/ml). The Re concentration in the river water samples ranged from 0.9 to 6.5 pg/ml and the three analysis results showed good agreement with each other.

The analysis by ICP-MS suggested that the uranium in the compounds has a natural composition. Therefore, the adsorbed compounds to the pine needles can be considered as potential indicators for the environmental monitoring of uranium.

The concentration of U-238 varied drastically between 0.045 and 1.02 mBq/l (a factor of about 20), while the U-234 concentration was almost unchanged, ranging from 2.30 to 3.07 mBq/l. Resultant U-234/U-238 activity ratios showed a wide range from 2.7 to 51. Equilibrium calculation by using the geochemical code showed that U for one end-member representing low uranium contents and very high U-234/U-238 ratios was expected to exist as UO2(CO3)(2)(2-). By using the U isotopic and C-14 dating methods, the age of this water was roughly estimated to be in the range of 10(4)-10(5) years.

It was found that the concrete samples were activated mainly by neutrons and that the major radioisotopes were Eu-152, Co-60, Cs-134, Na-22 and Mn-54. The maximum activity induced by thermal neutron capture was observed at the depth of 10 cm in the concrete wall near the deflector of the cyclotron. Tritium was also produced by the neutron reaction, because its concentration was proportional to the activities of Eu-152 and Co-60. The surface dose rates inside the accelerator room were also monitored to define the decontamination area. The surface dose rate was proportional to the residual radioactivity, such as Co-60. A careful evaluation was very useful in order to minimize the radioactive waste during decontamination.

The detection limit of Pu was about 0.001 pg.ml(-1) (ppt) in the sample solution or about 0.0005 pg in a total sample. This method was used to determine concentrations of Pu and its isotopic ratios in several soil samples collected from different areas in Japan. Concentrations of Pu in surface soils collected from forests were significantly higher than those in soils from agricultural fields.

In this work, the C-14 production cross section was measured for the nuclear spallation reaction of aluminum with 12-GeV protons. The chemical separation method of C-14 was also studied.

Various long-lived radionuclides, (Be-7, Na-22, Sc-46, Mn-54, Co-60, Cs-134, Eu-152 and Eu-154) were observed in the soil samples by gamma-ray spectra measurements, and H-3 was also detected by liquid scintillation counting. On the other hand, H-3, Na-22 and Mn-54, which were leached from the soil were measured in the groundwater below the EP2 beam line. H-3 and Na-22 were also found in slight amounts in groundwater collected in a well dug beside the East Counter Hall. From a comparison with the radioactive concentration in soil and groundwater, the order of the leaching percentages were H-3>Na-22>Mn-54. This tendency was in agreement with an experimental result of the RI laboratory.

Iron- and sulfate-reducing bacteria may enhance the release of radium (and its analog barium) from uranium mill tailings, oil field pipe scale [a major technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material (TENORM) waste], and jarosite (a common mineral in sulfuric acid processed-tailings). These research findings are reviewed and discussed in the context of nuclear waste forms (such as barium sulfate matrices), radioactive waste management practices, and geochemical environments in the Earth's surficial and shallow subsurface regions.

A value of lambda(f) (8.37+/-0.17) x 10(-17) a(-1) has been determined. The use of uranium-based neutron dosimetry for the measurement of lambda(f) through fission-track techniques is discussed. Particularly, the lambda(f) measurement by Roberts et al. (Phys. Rev. 174 (1968) 4847), is analyzed, showing that the value obtained by these authors (7.03 x 10(-17) a(-1)) underestimated lambda(f). It is concluded that the dosimetry based on U(n,f) reaction does not support lambda(f) value around 7 x 10(-17)a(-1) determined by various authors using mica-uranium sandwich.

Throughout the last 20 years, its gaseous diffusion enrichment plant (GDP) has been improved and optimized. Its flexibility is a unique asset, allowing the best use of the newly deregulated electricity market, for the benefit of its customers. Competitiveness, high safety standards and environmental excellence augur well for a reliable and sustainable future. This future will include a technological transition at some moment before the 2015 horizon. The progressive transition from gaseous diffusion to modern centrifuge is being planned, while making the best use of the existing Georges Besse diffusion plant, fit to serve well beyond the coming ten years, during which worldwide customers will benefit from EURODIF reliability, flexibility and large capacity. With and beyond gaseous diffusion, Cogema/EURODIF will remain a sustainable long-term supplier of enrichment services in the developing electro-nuclear industry.

J	Ryhanen, V				Ryhanen, V			Nuclear waste management	NUCLEAR PLANT JOURNAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	European Nuclear Conference	OCT, 2002	LILLE, FRANCE	European Nucl Soc				In 2001, the Finnish Parliament ratified the Decision-in-Principle on a final disposal facility of spent fuel to be constructed at the Olkiluoto site in Western Finland. Since the early 1980s, this decision was held up by research and development (R&D) and siting activities as well as by communications aiming at confidence building. Before recent important licensing and siting steps in the national waste management program, interim storage facilities for spent fuel have been constructed at both nuclear power plant sites. Two shallow underground repositories were commissioned for low- and medium-level operating waste in the 1990s. A longterm program and stepwise advancement have kept the annual costs of nuclear waste management moderate. All major objectives were decided by the government already in an early phase several decades ago, and these objectives have been met without significant delays. Nuclear power plant areas have been found out to be suitable even for location of waste storage and disposal facilities, which means benefits concerning infrastructure. Funds for R&D and the implementation of waste management have been collected in the price of nuclear electricity since the start of nuclear power generation.									0	2	2	0	0	EQES INC	GLEN ELLYN	799 ROOSEVELT RD, BUILDING 6, STE 208, GLEN ELLYN, IL 60137-5925 USA	0892-2055			NUCL PLANT J	Nucl.

The first phase of the strategy was to gain some irradiation experience for MOX produced by our own Short Binderless Route (SBR) process. To achieve this, the MOX Demonstration Facility (MDF) was built at Sellafiel, and 28 MOX fuel assemblies were produced up to 1998 that were loaded into PWRs in Europe. In 1994, BNFL started the construction of their large-scale MOX production plant, simulator modiciation package (SMP). The design and construction of the plant and supporting facilities were completed some years ago, and the commissioning of the plant with uranium commenced in June 1999. In October 2001, the United Kingdom government announced that the manufacture of MOX fuel in SMP was justified. On December 19,2001, the U.K. regulators gave BNFL their approval to start plutonium operations. This paper considers the status of BNFL's MOX project today and the progress that we have taken towards achieving our business objectives.									0	1	1	0	0	EQES INC	GLEN ELLYN	799 ROOSEVELT RD, BUILDING 6, STE 208, GLEN ELLYN, IL 60137-5925 USA	0892-2055			NUCL PLANT J	Nucl.

J	Coe, R				Coe, R			Web-based nuclear testing & training	NUCLEAR PLANT JOURNAL			English	Article								During the past two decades, technological advances in all areas of business have increased at a blinding rate, especially in the delivery and processing of information. Nowhere has this been more evident than in the area of training and testing of personnel by computerized methods. Many organizations have made tremendous advances in both the development and administration of training and computer-based testing in upgrade, certification and license testing. This "high-stakes" testing occurs in fields such as aviation, medical and the military. It is also emerging in the nuclear field where licensure and certification is critical to daily safe and effective job performance. Highly trained professionals in "high-stakes" jobs require many levels of cognitive skills. It is crucial that these skills be measured in the most accurate way to minimize possible statistical error, thus assuring the proper knowledge and skills needed to safely and effectively perform daily duties. Although exam security remains a sensitive issue, there are many advantages to computerized testing: Tests can be delivered on demand Graphics, sounds, videos and text can be combined to present test tasks that resemble real-life conditions. Exam scoring and analysis can be instantaneous. Web-based training is also becoming more popular because of its convenience and cost-effective availability to larger groups in different locations. The ability for students to move at their own learner-controlled comfortable pace can greatly enhance learning. Employees at nuclear power plants who need annual requalification training for site access, fitness-for-duty, basic radiological sciences, environmental monitoring, radioactive material shipment and regulatory changes can effectively do so on an Intranet and on the Internet. Students preparing for various types of requalification exams can study and take practice mock exams on the computer. Draft regulatory reports and requirements can be downloaded for convenient reference and study. Web-based training has broad appeal because, unlike traditional classroom environments, it can be configured to various learner needs and learning styles. More experienced learners can be accommodated with shortcuts to move through and be examined more quickly, thereby saving time away from the job. With organizations in the United States spending billions annually on training and on the qualification of its personnel, web-based testing and training is offering highly cost-effective and efficient alternatives to traditional settings.

In previous works we have shown the feasibility of this method, in conjunction with the use of the well-known MCNP simulation code and the use of artificial neural networks, to estimate the mass and enrichment of fissile samples enclosed in special, sealed containers. In a more recent works, we pointed out so-me features of MCNP that represent a drawback in the simulation of correlation measurements. In fact, MCNP is not intended for obtaining second order moments. Therefore, to achieve an agreement between the simulations and the experiment, we resorted to the use of effective physical parameters (for example detection threshold and light output). Recently, by suitably modifying MCNP, we developed the MCNP-PoliMi code, which attempts to simulate the physics of each interaction more realistically. In this paper, we present the results of the calibration of a plastic scintillator using a Cf-252 source, traditionally used in the above-mentioned nuclear safeguards experiments. We show that the physical parameters found by calibration and used in the MCNP-PoliMi simulations are reasonable for this type of detector, and that the correlation functions thereby obtained are in good agreement with the experiment.
