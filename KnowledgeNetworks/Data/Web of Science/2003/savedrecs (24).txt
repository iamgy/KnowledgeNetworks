The recently adopted recommendations of ICRP Publication 60 have made it extremely difficult to detect intakes of insoluble forms of natural uranium by in vivo methods (lung counting). A type S intake of UO2 corresponding to a 20 mSv effective dose has a lung burden that is a factor of 2-3 lower than the MDA, 6 months after the intake occurred. A new methodology, approved in principle by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. has been designed to overcome this problem by summing sequential, but separate, lung Counts for an individual, or summing lung Counts from a group of workers performing similar tasks. This summing technique effectively increases the Counting time and, therefore, reduces the MDA to a value below the dose limit. Doses will be assigned to the individual or work group based on the average lung burden.

Samples are analysed by alpha spectroscopy, and the results are examined for evidence of an intake of uranium. Because the measurement uncertainties are often comparable to the quantities of material we wish to detect. statistical considerations are crucial for the proper interpretation of the data. The problem is further complicated by the significant. but highly non-uniform, presence of uranium in local drinking water and, in some cases. food supply. Software originally developed for internal dosimetry of plutonium has been adapted to the problem Of uranium dosimetry. The software uses an unfolding algorithm to calculate an approximate Bayesian solution to the problem of characterising any intakes which may have occurred. given the history of urine bioassay results for each individual in the monitored population. The program uses biokinetic models from ICRP Publications 68 and later. and a prior probability distribution derived empirically front the body of uranium bioassay data collected at Los Alamos over the operating history of the laboratory. For each individual, the software creates a posterior probability distribution of intake quantity and solubility type as a function of time. Front this distribution. estimates are made of the cumulative committed dose (CEDE) to each individual. Results of the method are compared with those obtained using, an earlier classical (non-Bayesian) algorithm for uranium dosimetry. We also discuss the problem of distinguishing occupational intakes front intake of environmental uranium, within a Bayesian framework.

Relatively high tritium retention in the blood was found after TAA injection. This observation was explained by a low rate of clearance of non-volatile tritium components. The dose estimated for the soft tissues after TAA injection was larger than that estimated on the basis of tritium concentration in urine by a factor of 1.8-2.3. In both HTO and TAA injections. the blood tritium level gave a conservative estimate of the dose to Soft tissues including active bone marrow. The accumulated close to Soft tissues after oral administration tended to be lower than that for intraperitoneal injection.

In radiotoxicology, this kind of exercise makes it possible to keep up with laboratory know-how and with the evolution and relative performances of analytical techniques. The intercomparison exercises organised by PROCORAD (Association for the Promotion of Quality Controls in Radiotoxicological Bioassays) provide an opportunity to compare and contrast radiochemistry and inetrology for the in vitro analysis of urine and faeces. For uranium compounds, the development of new techniques, Such as inductively Coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), alpha spectrometry, and laser spectrofluorimetry makes it possible to compare the effectiveness of these protocols with respect to radiation protection monitoring, both in routine and special situations. Detection limits, flexibility, repeatability, reproducibility and isotopic quantification are the criteria considered in this study. The authors present the evolution of performances for the analysis of uranium in urine over the years. However, the goal of the laboratories taking part in these annual exercises is not only to check the accuracy of their results but also to have analytical discussions and the opportunity to exchange experiences that will enrich the group's general competence.

Wounding bypasses the body's natural barriers to foreign objects, such as the skin and the lining of the alimentary canal. Therefore a relatively low intake can potentially result in a high committed effective dose. The likelihood of contamination of a wound with either plutonium or uranium is low. The decision-making process for dealing with wounds has been continually reviewed and updated by the approved dosimetry set-vice (ADS) at Dounreay. Each wound is considered on an individual basis by the ADS in order to decide what follow-up actions, if any, arc necessary. The aim of the process is to maximise the probability that a significant intake is detected, while targeting resources in an appropriate manner.

The whole body counting (WBC) faculty at CIEMAT uses a low-energy Ge detector system with different available Counting geometric.-, to estimate the retention of actinides in the lungs and evaluate I-125 in thyroid and Am-241 in bone (skull and knee). A study of the factors and uncertainties involved in estimations of MDA is presented for lung and thyroid monitoring. The dependence of detection limits on counting efficiency in the measurement of low-energy emitters in the lungs has been carefully studied, carrying out a comparison among different biometric equations obtained by ultrasound techniques for estimations of chest wall thickness. Dosimetric implications of the estimated MDAs are taken into account in the framework of ICRP 78 application and considering Spanish regulations. The main interest in lung measurements is for the assessment of occupational exposure. This work confirms the low-energy Ge detector system to be an adequate in vivo technique for the routine monitoring of internal exposure to most insoluble uranium compounds (detection of 3% enriched uranium in lungs), and also to be useful in special monitoring programmes or in the case of incidents when the detection of Am-241 is required.

Their pharmacological properties are favourable for in vivo Pu chelation - penetration of extracellular water, useful residence in the circulation, substantial hepato-biliary excretion, low but useful GI absorption, and transitory residence in the kidneys. Reductions of body Pu were significant, compared with controls, when oral administration to normally fed mice (30 or 100 mumol kg(-1)) was delayed as long as 24 h after iv Pu injection. The HOPO ligands (10-100 mumol kg(-1)) or CaNa3- DTPA (100 or 300 mumol kg(-1)) were given orally to normally fed mice starting at 4 It after an iv Pu injection and continued 5 d per week for 3 weeks. 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) (100 mumol kg(-1)) reduced Pu in skeleton, liver, and body, to 44 +/- 9, 18 +/- 8, and 38 +/- 7% of controls, respectively, reductions significantly greater than with the mixed HOPO ligand or with three times more CaNa3-DTPA.

Direct surveys of the wound site confirmed the presence of contamination. The chelating agent Ca-DTPA was administered via a nebuliser within an hour after discovery of the wound. External measurements were made of the Wound site and wound dressings; 24-h urinary excretion data were collected periodically and the Pu and Am urine content was determined. Zn-DTPA was administered on three occasions. The ICRP Pu systemic model was modified to consider the enhanced urinary excretion following administration of the chelating agents. The analysis indicated that the wound resulted in an initial deposition of 400 Bq Pu-238, 2240 Bq Pu-239/240 and 1060 Bq Am-241. About 70% of the initial wound activity was removed by surgical procedures and less than 1% of the wound activity was removed by chelation therapy. This paper compares the observed urinary excretion data with that indicated by a simulation of the kinetics of the transfer from the wound site and the kinetics of the chelating agent and Pu.

Results showed that only thorium in mixed-ligand solution was entirely translocated from the muscle. with the greatest part being excreted from the body. In this case, the whole-body retention of thorium decreased to 16% of the injected radioactivity within 2 d, 13% being retained in the skeleton. Studies on the decorporation of Th-234 + Th-232 nitrates from a rat wound simulated with i.m. injection have also been carried out. The greatest translocation of thorium and its excretion was achieved with a single local injection of the mixed-ligand (citrate + CaDTPA) solution when compared with those of citrate or CaDTPA alone. The efficiency of mixed-ligand treatment decreased with its delay. On day 2 post-therapy, the whole-body content of thorium decreased to 30, 37 and 55% of injected radioactivity when the local treatment started immediately, postponed to 1 h or 24 h, after i.m. injection of thorium, respectively. In control rats without treatment, there was only a slight decrease in the content of thorium in the whole body.

However, both DTPA and uranium are nephrotoxic at high dosages and DTPA has been shown to increase in vitro the cytotoxicity induced by uranium on cultured epithelia tubular cells. This work aimed to test this effect in vivo. Rats were injected with subtoxic (57 mug kg(-1)) to toxic (639 mug k(-1)) amounts of uranium as nitrate at 0 h, they received two DTPA injections (30 mumol k(-1)) at 2 min and 24 h and were euthanased at 48 h. The nephrotoxic effects were evaluated by measurement of the body weight gain. food and water intake, measurement of biochemical parameters in urine and blood, and histological examination of one kidney. The main result was that DTPA did not increase the nephrotoxicity induced by uranium in the range of concentrations tested. which was inconsistent with the in vitro results.

Plutonium and americium in rats after intramuscular injection of (U-Pu)O-2 particles (MOX). Sixteen rats were contaminated by intramuscular injection of a 1 mg MOX suspension and then treated daily for 7 d with LIHOPO (30 or 200 mumol kg(-1)) or DTPA (30 mumol kg(-1)). LIHOPO was inefficient for removing Pu, Am and U from the wound site. However, it reduced Pu retention in carcass and liver by factors of 2 and 6 respectively, and Am retention in carcass and liver by factors of 10 and 30. In contrast, the effect of LIHOPO on U was to decrease the retention in kidneys by a factor of 75. These results confirm that LIHOPO is a good candidate for use after contamination with MOX, in combination with localised Wound lavage or surgical treatment aimed at removing most of the contaminant at the wound site.

This study, Using an established in vitro system, compared removal of Pu and Ani bound to bone mineral by ZnNa(3)DTPA and 10 chelating agents designed specifically to sequester actinides. including Pu and Am. Ligands tested were tetra, hexa, and octadentate, with linear or branched backbones containing sulfocatechol [CAM(S)], hydroxycatechol [CAM(C)], hydroxipyridinone (1,2-HOPO, Me-3,2-HOPO), or hydroxamate functional groups. The wide range of Pu and Am removal exhibited by the test ligands generally agreed with their metal coordination and chemical properties. The most effective agents for Pu (100 muM concentration, 24-48 h contact) are all octadentate as follows: 34.3-LICAM(S) (54% unbound): 3,4,3-LICAM(C) (6.2%); 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) (3.8%): H(2,2)-(Me-3,2-HOPO) (2.2%) and DFO-(1,2-HOPO) (1.8%). The other ligands removed less than 1% of the bound Pu: and ZnNa(3)DTPA removed only 0.086%. The most effective ligands for Am removal (100 muM, 24-48 h contact) are as follows: octadentate H(2,2)-(Me-3,2-HOPO) (21% unbound); 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) (14.5%) and 3,4,3-LICAM(C) (5.9%); hexadentate TREN-(Me-3,2-HOPO) and TREN-(1,2-HOPO) (9.6%); and tetradentate 5-LIO(Me-3,2-HOPO) (5.2%). Am removal by ZnNa(3)DTPA was about 1.4%. Among the ligands presently considered for possible human use, only 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) removed potentially useful amounts of both Pu and Am from bone mineral.

For this purpose. intravenous injections of DTPA (30 mumol kg(-1)) or 3,4,3-LIHOPO or 4,4,4-LIHOPO at dosages of 0.3 or 30 mumol kg(-1) were performed 1, 6 and 24 h after contamination of rats by intravenously injected Pu-238 curate and 1 h after intravenous injection of 233U nitrate. Actinide content in the main retention organs and cumulated excretion were measured 48 h after contamination. These experiments show similar decorporation efficacies of 4,4,4-LIHOPO and 3,4,3-LIHOPO for Pu, which are much higher than that of DTPA. At a dosage of 0.3 mumol kg(-1), the two LIHOPO analogues were as efficient as DTPA at a dosage of 30 mumol kg(-1). After U contamination, a 20% decorporation efficacy was obtained for either 3,4,3-LIHOPO or 4,4,4-LIHOPO at a dosage of 30 mumol kg(-1).

Cost may also prevent other types of scenario being tested. An alternative is to use Monte Carlo simulations to make the investigations. This paper exemplifies how Monte Carlo code calculations can be used to fill the gap by describing two investigations: (1) the possible self-attenuation of homogeneously distributed natural uranium in a lung, phantom; and (2) the effect of activity deposited in the ribs on the activity estimate from a lung count.

The scheme consists of the following procedures. (1) The consistency of nuclear structure data files used as input to the computer code EDISTR is established by referring to the latest nuclear parameters and by comparing the computed energies of emitted radiations with total decay energy. (2) A method for calculating detailed spectra of X rays and Auger electrons is incorporated into EDISTR to enhance the treatment of atomic relaxation processes initiated by electron vacancies from internal conversion and electron capture. (3) Quality assurance of the compiled data is undertaken by comparisons with experimental data and other decay databases prepared from different computer codes and libraries. JAERI and ORNL are cooperating to implement the scheme in order to assemble a comprehensive radioactive decay database including over 1000 nuclides.

For most of these agents, the available biokinetic data are insufficient to construct realistic compound-specific biokinetic models for calculating the internal radiation dose delivered to persons undergoing investigation. A generic model for brain receptor substances that predicts the internal dose with sufficient accuracy for general radiation protection purposes has, therefore, been developed. Biokinetic data for 13 C-11-radiopharmaceuticals used clinically for imaging different brain receptors indicate that, despite differences in chemical structure. their uptake and retention in the human brain and other tissues are broadly similar. The proposed model assumes instantaneous deposition of 5% of the injected radioactivity in the brain, with the remaining radioactivity being rapidly and uniformly distributed throughout all other tissues. Elimination from all tissues is assumed to occur with a half-time of 2 h. It is further assumed that 75% of the injected C-11 is excreted in the urine, and 25% via the gall bladder, with a half-time of 2 h. This model yields all effective dose of 4.5 X 10(-3) mSv MBq(-1), with doses of 3.2 X 10(-2), 1.7 X 10(-2), 8.7 X 10(-3), 5.2 X 10(-3), and 3.8 X 10(-3) mGy MBq(-1) to the urinary bladder, gall bladder, kidneys, brain and ovaries, respectively. These closes are well within the range of those reported using compound-specific models for the radiopharmaceutals studied.

The residents of riverside communities were exposed to internal irradiation front radionuclides ingested mainly with river water, and also to external gamma irradiation resulting from shoreline and flood-plain contamination. The most important role in population exposure was played by Sr-89,Sr-99 and Cs-137. The persons born after the onset of the contamination have been identified Lis the 'Techa River Offspring Cohort' (TROC). The TROC has the potential to provide direct data oil health effects in progeny that resulted front exposure of a general population to chronic radiation. This report describes the results of the calculation of fetal doses due to intakes of radionuclides by their mothers. Particular attention has been given to fetal dose from Sr-90 because this nuclide is the most significant in terms of population dose for the Techa River. The comparison of the fetal bone marrow doses evaluated using different approaches proposed in the literature has shown a large dispersal in dose values. The main cause of this is the difference in model assumptions simplifying some developmental aspects of fetal haematopoiesis and bone formation. This paper presents an analysis of these basic assumptions that Could be useful for further improvements in fetal dosimetry.

About 30 y old thorium hydroxide was used as the source for the generation of thoron and its decay products. The study has revealed that under a low ventilation rate (similar to1 air charge per hour) and at high equilibrium equivalent concentration (EER) of thoron, above 275 Bq m(-3) (>1 WL), a considerable fraction of Ph-212 nuclides are negatively charged. It was also concluded that Ph-212 has lesser charge (per ion) than Bi-212 and is more susceptible to an electric field. There is a linear relationship between the activity collected and the voltage applied and the activity collected is proportional to the area of the collecting surface. Under the experimental conditions, when a voltage of +/-2500 V is simultaneously applied, the activity concentration can be reduced by a factor of 100.

Recently, increasing attention has been paid to the precise estimations of this health risk by numerous models. The compartmental model published in ICRP Publication 66 (HRTM) has been used for calculating alpha activity concentration in human lung. Energy deposition in the tissue was calculated by the Bethe-Bloch equation. The aim of this study was to check the performance and to compare the reliability of the microdosimetric models. In this work different thicknesses of mucus in the cases of non-smokers and smokers has been considered. Transformed cells were considered as the radiation risk parameters. The radiation risk evaluation for different exposure levels was based on homogeneous and heterogeneous distributions of target cells. The results of application of these procedures were compared with the epidemiological study of Czechoslovakian uranium miners.

Her employer estimated the intake to be about 73 Bq Class W plutonium. Based on bioassay results and clearance models in use at that time, they calculated her body content at the beginning of pregnancy to be about 5.6 Bit with an average concentration of approximately 60 mBq kg(-1). The placenta and cord from this pregnancy, along with the placenta and cord from a donor with no known exposure to plutonium (Case 0835), were divided and assayed for plutonium by ultrasensitive fission track analysis at two collaborating laboratories. Placental Pu-239 concentration values obtained by the two laboratories for Case 0777 agreed within a factor of 2 and were several-fold greater than for the control, Case 0835, as well as values that had been reported by others for unexposed populations. There was no elevated concentration of plutonium in the umbilical cord from the exposed person. The data yielded values of 0.16 and 0.27 for placental to maternal concentrations (C-PI: C-M) that were of the same order of magnitude as the value of 0.1 the ICRP calculated for intakes before pregnancy.

The vast majority of these deaths are likely to occur in individuals who also smoke cigarettes. Because of the skewed nature of the distribution of the indoor radon concentrations in most populations, most of the deaths will occur in individuals who are exposed at moderate rather than at very high radon concentrations. In order to enable appropriate policies to be developed for managing the consequences of exposure to radon, more reliable estimates of the risk of lung cancer resulting from it are needed. To achieve this, a European Collaborative Group on Residential Radon and Lung Cancer was initiated and its findings should be published in 2004.

A validated biologically based model, whose parameters have a direct biological interpretation, can also be used to extrapolate cancer risks to different exposure conditions with some confidence. In this article biologically based models for radiation carcinogenesis, including the two-stage clonal expansion (TSCE) model and its extensions, are reviewed. The biological and mathematical bases for such models are described, and the implications of key model parameters for cancer risk assessment examined. Specific applications of versions of the TSCE model to important epidemiological datasets are discussed, including the Colorado uranium miners' cohort; a cohort of Chinese tin miners; the lifespan cohort of atomic bomb survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki; and a cohort of over 200,000 workers included in the National Dose Registry (NDR) of Canada.

J	Richardson, RB; Dubeau, J				Richardson, RB; Dubeau, J			Monte Carlo determination of age-dependent steady-state dose to red bone marrow and bone from C-14 exposure	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							SEEKING RADIONUCLIDES; ADIPOSE-TISSUE; FAT-CELLS; DOSIMETRY; SIZE; LEUKEMIA; FALLOUT; TRITIUM; NUMBER; MODELS	Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to calculate the age-dependent dose from the beta decay of C-14 to marrow and bone on the basis of a steady-state specific-activity model. A model of the trabecular cavity containing spherical fat cells in a square lattice surrounded by haemopoietic tissue was employed. The age-dependent C-14 dose to haemopoietic (red) marrow was estimated taking account of the change in the fat cell size with fat fraction. Allowances were made for the change in the percentage cellularity and distribution of active marrow in the whole skeleton as a function of age. Age-dependent changes in trabecular cavity size and bone composition were found to have only a small effect on dose. Dose rate, were estimated under steady-state conditions, for food ingested with a C-14 specific activity of 1 Bq g(-1) of C. The equivalent dose rate to the haemopoietic tissue of a 20 year-old adult is 77 muSv a(-1), and 39 muSv a(-1) for a 3-month-old infant. Similarly, the equivalent dose rate to the bone surfaces of an adult is 48 muSv a(-1), and 38 muSv a(-1) for an infant. Therefore, the equivalent dose rate to marrow and bone stern cells increases with age under steady state conditions.

All 16 volunteers suspect exposures to depleted uranium (DU) while deployed at the two different theatres of war in 1990 and later on. The Bremen laboratory control served as a reference in this study. Compared with this control there was a statistically significant increase in the frequency of dicentric chromosomes (dic) and centric ring chromosomes (cR) in the veterans' group, indicating a previous exposure to ionising radiation. The statistically significant overdispersion of dic and cR indicates nonuniform irradiation as would be expected after non-uniform exposure and/or exposure to radiation with a high linear energy transfer (LET). The frequency of SCEs was decreased when compared with the laboratory control.

J	Gafvert, T; Pagels, J; Holm, E				Gafvert, T; Pagels, J; Holm, E			Thorium exposure during tungsten inert gas welding with thoriated tungsten electrodes	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								The exposure to Th-232 from TIG welding with thoriated electrodes has been determined at five different workshops. Welding with both alternating and direct current was investigated. The exposure levels of Th-232 were generally below 10 mBq m(-3) in the breathing zone of the welders. Two samples from AC welding showed significant higher exposure levels, probably due to maladjustment of the TIG welding power source. Samples of the respirable fraction of Th-232 from grinding thoriated electrodes were also collected showing exposure levels of 5 mBq m(-3) or lower. A dose estimate has been made for two scenarios, one realistic and one with conservative assumptions, showing that the annual committed effective dose from inhalation of Th-232, Th-230, Th-228 and Ra-228, for a full-time TIG welder, in the realistic case is below 0.3 mSv and with conservative assumptions around 1 mSv or lower. The contribution from grinding electrodes was lower, 10 muSv or lower in the realistic case and 63 muSv or lower based on conservative assumptions. The study does not exclude occurrence of higher exposure levels under welding conditions different from those prevailing in this study.

Indoor radon and high resolution in situ gamma spectrometry measurements were performed in 60 apartments in Thessaloniki, the second largest city of Greece. Geometric mean radon concentration is 52 Bq m(-3). The mean total absorbed dose rate in air due to gamma radiation is 56 +/- 9 nGy h(-1). The contribution of the different radionuclides to the total indoor gamma dose rate in air is 41% due to K-40, 36% due to the thorium series and 23% due to the uranium series. No correlation was found between indoor gamma dose rate due to the uranium series and indoor radon for ground and first floor apartments. For upper floor apartments (above the second floor) a weak correlation is observed. The mean annual effective dose due to radon is 1.15 mSv, i.e., more than four times higher compared to the effective dose due to gamma radiation (0.27 mSv).

Three of the waters were of Ca-HCO3 type and two of Na-Cl type. Some of the waters also exhibited high concentrations of Fe, Mn and humic substances. U-234,U-238 was present entirely in soluble form in all waters, probably as uranyl ion (UO22+) in soluble carbonate complexes. Ra-226 was in soluble form in the waters with low concentrations of Fe and Mn, but 10% of the total Ra-226 activity was bound to particles in the Fe-Mn-rich waters. The behaviour of Po varied with water composition. Particle-bound Po-210 was observed to correlate with the combined concentration of iron and manganese in the raw waters. In the two of waters of Na-Cl type, in which the concentrations of Fe, Mn and humic substances were high, salinity of the waters did not enhance the solubility of polonium. Polonium was present in both soluble and particle-bound forms in all the ground waters.

Extraction experiments are performed with diethylether from 5.57 M calcium nitrate solution with nitric acid concentration of 2 M. Uranium is extracted in the pH range 0.6-0.8 and thorium is extracted after acidification with 2 M HNO3. Alpha-sources are obtained by a selective electrodeposition of U(VI) or Th(IV) directly from the extracting solution without applying back-extraction or purification steps. The dependence of the electrodeposition and the overall recovery of U and/or Th are examined as a function of the amount of phosphate ions (C-PO4(3-)) in the electrolyte and of the aqueous phase, respectively. In all cases a decrease of the deposition yield with C-PO4(3-) is observed. An improvement in the uranium overall recovery is achieved from 7.57 to 9.57 M nitrate solution and PO43- concentration lower than 0.8 M. The method proposed is applied to technical wet phosphoric acid, phosphate rock and phosphogypsum leachates. Recoveries of 74%-93% are obtained for uranium and 54%-69% for thorium. Good resolutions (37-52 keV) are also achieved under optimum conditions. These resolutions allow to make accurate determination of U and Th isotopes in the above mentioned samples.

The retention of Co-60 was almost independent of chemical composition of slag. On the other hand, the retention of Cs-137 decreased with an increase of the basicity of slag, defined as a ratio of CaO to SiO2 in wt.%, but was independent of FeO concentration. Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopic analysis and Mossbauer spectroscopic measurement were also conducted for the solidified product. Mossbauer spectra indicated that Fe2+ ions as well as Ca2+ ions existed as network modifying cations in a silicate network structure of slag. Referring to a structure model of silicate glasses, it is inferred that the retention Of (CS)-C-137 reflects differences in chemical properties between Ca2+ and Fe2+ in the internetwork region formed by modifying cations and anionic non-bridging oxygen.

The experiment was carried out by oversaturation and undersaturation methods at ionic strength I = 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0. The concentration of Pu(VI) was measured by alpha-spectrometry and UV/visible spectrophotometry, and the equilibrium constant of the reaction, PuO2(OH)(2) = PuO22+ +2OH(-), was obtained. From the obtained results, the solubility products (K-sp) of Pu hydrous oxide at I = 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 were determined. The experimental values were extrapolated to the standard state (I = 0) by using the specific interaction theory (SIT), and the solubility product of Pu hydrous oxide was determined to be log K-sp(degrees) = -22.88+/-0.39. The ion interaction coefficient epsilon (PuO22+, ClO4-) was also evaluated to be 0.30+/-0.09.

(H2O)(2)). Powder X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscopy and solution chemistry were used to monitor the alteration of the initial metaschoepite. In general, the secondary phases predicted by the thermodynamic model formed. However, an unexpected mineral (a calcium uranate) was observed above pH 8. Also, within the timeframe of these experiments, U(VI) silicate phases only formed at Si concentrations much higher than the lower field boundaries for uranophane and soddyite.

J	Banerjee, S; Basu, S				Banerjee, S; Basu, S			Synergistic extraction of Th(IV) by 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and neutral donors	RADIOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						synergistic extraction; Th(IV); 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde thiosemicarbazone	SOLVENT-EXTRACTION; CALIXARENES; THORIUM(IV); CALIX<4>ARENES; COMPLEXATION; C-60; C-70; ACID	The extraction behaviour of Th(IV) from aqueous nitric acid medium employing 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde thiosemicarbazone has been studied in the presence of various donors, like trioctyl phosphine oxide (TOPO), calix[3]OH[3]-OMe[6]arene, trioctyl amine (TOA), dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) in ethylacetate solvent. The constants (log k(ex)) for the binary complex in organic phase [Th(A)(NO3)(3)], where A is the ligand, was found to be 3.99, which was by far the largest amongst the corresponding values known for the other thiosemicarbazones. The overall equilibrium constants (log K) for the ternary species [Th(A)TOPO(NO3)(3)], [Th(A)TOA-(NO3)(3)], [Th(A)Calix[3]OH[3]OMe[6]arene(NO3)(3)], [Th(A)-DMSO(NO3)(3)] were estimated to be 8.287, 8.862, 8.415, 6.921 respectively. The trend in equilibrium constants were in accordance with the substitution of the donor. The extraction of Th4+ by the ligand-donor combination was maximum at pH = 1 and extraction decreases with increase in pH. It has been found that the extent of extraction of Th4+ in the organic phase as the binary as well as ternary complex [Th(A)(NO3)(3)] and [Th(A)(NO3)(3)S], where S is the donor, increases with increase in the concentration of the ligand. Similar trend is obtained in the extraction by donors in absence of ligand. In case of ternary extraction, using different donors, amines are found to perform best compared to the other donors. The trend is as follows: TOA > calix[3]OH[3]OMe[6]arene > TOPO > DMSO. In addition, the effect of different diluents on extraction was also studied and the observed trend was methyl salicylate > ethyl acetate > methyl isobutyl ketone > ethyl benzoate.

A separation method was developed which led to > 99.9% pure Co-55 and allowed a recovery of the enriched target material. For a target thickness of E-d = 12.6 --> 5 MeV, the experimental thick target yield of Co-55 after chemical separation amounted to about 13 MBq/muA.h, which is about 60% of the theoretical value. In a 3 h irradiation at 4 muA, the batch yield of Co-55 achieved was 160 MBq (4.3 mCi). An 8 h irradiation could lead to a batch yield of about 400 MBq. The Fe-54(d, n) reaction leads to the highest purity Co-55 but it is essential that the isotopic enrichment of the target is not less than 90%. In addition to the production work, cross sections were measured for the Fe-54(d, t)Fe-53 and Fe-54(d, alpha)Mn-52m reactions using the standard stacked-foil technique and high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometry. The cross section ratio for the isomeric pair Mn-52mg is discussed in terms of the spins of the two states involved and the increasing projectile energy.

In view of the selective complexation of D2EHIBA towards hexavalent metal ions over tetravalent metal ions, the focus of the present work is to identify a suitable oxidant of Pu. Amongst various oxidising agents investigated for the oxidation of Pu to Pu(VI), AgO appears to be a promising candidate as (i) it is thermodynamically as well as kinetically a favourable oxidant and (ii) unlike Cr(VI) and Ce(IV), it is not co-extracted with Pu towards the organic phase.

Spectrophotometric study of Np(V) and Pu(VI) in NH4TcO4 aqueous solutions (TcO4- concentration ranging between 0.2-0.5 M) shows only a slight interaction of NpO2+ and PUO22+ -ions with pertechnetate oxoanions in solution. On the contrary, for Np(V), Np(Vl) and Pu(VI) pertechnetates in solid state, changes in the spectra clearly evidence the coordination of the actinides(V,VI) with TcO4- -anions. That is in agreement with Np(VI) pertechnetate X-ray structural analysis performed on a single crystal.

J	Buongiorno, J; Larson, C; Czerwinski, KR				Buongiorno, J; Larson, C; Czerwinski, KR			Speciation of polonium released from molten lead bismuth	RADIOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						polonium; lead-bismuth; lead polonide; polonium hydride	PO-210	The alpha-emitter Po-210 is an activation product of liquid lead-bismuth, a low melting eutectic under investigation as a coolant of the next generation fast nuclear reactors. Experiments were performed to measure the gaseous polonium chemical species for assessing the radioactivity release from a Pb-Bi bath upon contact with a gas stream. The vapor pressure of lead polonide was measured over the 400-550degreesC temperature range and found to be in agreement with an existing correlation derived from data at higher temperatures. Also, it was experimentally confirmed that the presence of steam in the gas stream above the Pb-Bi melt substantially increases the amount of polonium released due to the formation of the volatile compound H2Po. The free-energy variation of the H2Po formation reaction was determined, permitting the calculation of the Po gas phase speciation under the experimental conditions.

The results demonstrated that these trivalent lanthanoids were extracted into 1,2-dichloroethane as Ln(FBPI)(3) with HFBPI alone and as Ln(FBPI)(3)(.)DC18C6 in the presence of crown ether. The equilibrium constants of the above extracted complexes have been deduced by non-linear regression analysis. The equilibrium constants of the synergistic species were found to increase monotonically with decrease in ionic radii of these metal ions. The addition of a crown ether to the metal chelate system not only enhanced the extraction efficiency significantly but also improved the selectivites among these trivalent lanthanoids. Solid complexes of these metal ions with HFBPI and with mixtures of HFBPI and crown ether have also been isolated and characterised by IR and H-1 NMR spectroscopic techniques.

The mineralogical structure of sediment samples investigated by X-ray diffraction on random and oriented slides and the cation exchange capacity determined by the silver-thiourea procedure were used to explain this pattern of accumulation. The clay mineral content of the samples, the type of clay mineral and the geochemical behaviour of the radionuclides are discussed as important factors for a preferential accumulation of contaminants in sediments.

However, (14)O (T(1/2) = 70.6 s) and (13)N (T(1/2) = 10 min) are also formed as side products via the (14)N(p, n) and (14)N(p, d + pn) reactions, respectively. In this work detailed cross section measurements were carried out for those two side reactions up to 19.2 MeV using N(2) gas and nitrogen-containing solid targets. From the data, the thick-target yields and the exact level of radioactive impurities in (11)C were calculated. In the case of (14)O. the results also confirmed the possibility of producing this beta(+) emitting radionuclide in sufficient quantities for PET investigations.

For neptunium in concentration ranging from similar to10(-10) to similar to10(-2.5) M, Np(IV) and Np(VI) were quantitatively adsorbed on the impregnated resin in a solution of the acidity 1.0-0.1 M HClO4, while Np(V) remained in the liquid phase. In the same condition, the precipitate of bismuth phosphate absorbed Np(IV) selectively, leaving Np(V) and Np(VI) in the liquid phase. By carrying out these adsorption methods in Ultrafree-MC Microporous Centrifugal Filter Units (Millipore Corporation), the oxidation state distribution of neptunium in acid solution can be determined in a simple manner with a small sample volume (500 mul) regardless of its concentration.

Zirconium was added in order to investigate potential additional stabilization of the thorium matrix from ZrO2. Studies were performed from pH 4 to pH 9 under both 100% Argon and 10% CO2/90% Ar at 25degreesC in 0.1M NaClO4. Reaction kinetics and equilibrium concentrations were evaluated for each condition. Rate constants increased with pH and varied from 6 x 10(-4) hr(-1) to 4 x 10(-2) hr(-1). The surface area normalized dissolution rate decreased with increasing pH, the highest being 5 x 10(-7) gm(-2) d(-1) at pH 4. The solubility product constants calculated from the equilibrium concentrations for the two ceramics were equivalent, with K-spTh3UO8 = -48.3+/-0.4 and K-spZrTh3UO8 = -47.9+/-0.9. The data was used to calculate the Th solution phase concentration. The result was compared to the dissolution of UO2 from pH 5-9 in 0.1 M NaClO4 under a 1% CO2 atmosphere at 25 degreesC. It was found that the U from the UO2 had a higher solution phase concentration than Th at high pH and was highly dependent upon the solution Eh of the evaluated conditions.

J	Kim, E; Boulegue, J				Kim, E; Boulegue, J			Chemistry of rhenium as an analogue of technetium: Experimental studies of the dissolution of rhenium oxides in aqueous solutions	RADIOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article								The migration of fissiogenic Tc into the environment can be predicted by studying the dissolution behavior of Re, a chemical analogue of Tc, avoiding the use of a radioactive element at high concentration. We developed a series of experimental studies of the solubility of Re oxides under various oxidation states (+VII, +IV, and +III), in oxidizing and anoxic media, so as to verify the validity of the available thermodynamic data concerning Re. The experimental results confirm that the predictable solubility of Re, under the conditions found in radioactive wastes storage, is very high when in the form of ReO4-, an analogue of TcO4-. The Re(III) oxide, Re2O3, is not stable in aqueous solutions and therefore the existence of Re(III) in surface conditions is not much likely. The Re(IV) oxide. ReO2, is weakly soluble. Its solubility is in the range 4 x 10(-7)-10(-6) mol L-1, which suggests that Re(IV) can be found in noticeable concentrations in aqueous solutions even in anoxic media; similar result is expected for Tc.

The permeation rates of the elements from feed solutions of various acidity into receiving solutions of 2 mol dm(-3) HCl were determined. The feed solution at pH 1.5 gave the highest percentage of permeation for Ce, Pm, Eu, Gd and Yb. amounting to about 90% after 25-h permeation. The percentage of permeation of Y and Lu was the highest at pH 1, amounting to about 90% after 25-h permeation. The permeation of Sc from all the feed solutions was less than 4% due to its adsorption on the vessel. The permeation from the feed solution at pH 1.5 into the receiving solutions of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mol dm(-3) HCl showed that the maximum percentage of transport for Y and Yb was obtained in 2 mol dm(-3) HCl receiving solution and that for Lu in 2-4 mol dm(-3) HCl receiving solutions. The other elements gave a percentage of transport more than 90% in 1-5 mol dm(-3) HCl receiving solutions, showing no obvious HCl concentration effect. The permeability coefficients of these elements were determined. Solvent extraction of the elements by EHEHPA-decalin was also carried out for comparison.
