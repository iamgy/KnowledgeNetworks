J	Aghara, SK; Beard, CA				Aghara, SK; Beard, CA			Feasibility study of a proliferation-resistant fuel form for plutonium recycling	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						proliferation resistance; actinide fuels; plutonium recycling	REACTOR	A feasibility study of a proliferation-resistant fuel form for commercial power reactors was conducted. An increase in Pu-238 is known to increase the heat load in pure plutonium metal. At high Pu-238 concentrations in spent fuel, the heat load in the plutonium may, be sufficiently high that it will be less desirable for weapons production. An actinide-based fuel is proposed that will increase the ratio of Pu-238/Pu-239 in spent fuel, leading to a fuel form resistant to diversion for weapons use. Two actinides were considered, Np-237 and Am-241, for seeding in low-enriched (3% U-235) uranium oxide fuel. The ORIGEN point depletion code was utilized to calculate time-dependent spent-fuel concentrations of Pu-238, Pu-239, Np-237, Am-241, and other nuclides of interest. The preliminary results show that both Np-237 and Am-241 in small quantities generate significant Pu-238 in spent fuel, and more importantly, both actinide-based fuels shift the Pu-238/Pu-239 ratio significantly higher at relatively small initial concentrations. Based on a closed-loop actinide-fuel life cycle study, a (237)ATp-based fuel cycle seems much more sustainable as compared to Am-241. However, Am-241 addition to Np-237-based fuel may, have benefits in reducing the end-of-cycle deficit of 237Np.

The economics, operations and safety performance of U.S. nuclear power plants is excellent. In addition, both the safety and economic regulation of nuclear power are being changed to produce better economic parameters for future nuclear plant operations and the licenses for plant operations are being extended to 60 years. There is further a growing awareness of the value of clean, emissions-free nuclear power. These parameters combine to form a firm foundation for continued successful U.S. nuclear plant operations, and even the potential for new plant construction. In order to realize a bright future for nuclear power, we must respond successfully to five challenges: Nuclear power must remain economically competitive, The public must remain confident in the safety of the plants and the fuel cycle. Nuclear wastes and spent fuel must be managed and the ultimate disposition pathways for nuclear wastes must be politically settled. The proliferation potential of the commercial nuclear fuel cycle must continue to be minimized, and We must assure a sustained manpower supply for the future and preserve the critical nuclear technology infrastructure. The Generation IV program is conceived to focus the efforts of the international nuclear community on responding to these challenges. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

It must be economical and it must be proven that it fulfills the conditions for sutainability. This means that the requirements of no short term depletion of resources extremely low emission of noxious or radioactive substances to the environment extremely low release of radioactivity from a nuclear plant in case of the most severe accidents and the present very long term problem of high active waste must be transformed into a few hundred years problem through destruction of plutonium, transmutation of the minor actinides and the most important very long lived fission products.

J	Aoki, S				Aoki, S			Research and development in Japan on long-lived nuclide partitioning and transmutation technology	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd Fujihara International Seminar of the Tokyo-Institute-of-Technology-on-Advanced-Nuclear-Energy-Systems Towards Zero Release of Radioactive Wastes	NOV 06-09, 2000	SUSONO, JAPAN	Tokyo Inst Technol Adv Nucl Energy Syst				Measures to treat and dispose of radioactive waste are one of the most important issues in the development and application of nuclear energy. The Atomic Energy Commission has carefully considered how to classify radioactive waste properly and how to dispose of it according to these classifications. For high-level radioactive waste (HI-W), efforts towards implementing disposal have been progressing steadily. At the same time, recognizing the nature of the radioactive nuclides contained in HLW, the aim since the early days of nuclear energy has been to develop technology either to separate useful elements and nuclides in order to reuse them effectively, or to transmute long-lived nuclides into short-lived or stable - i.e., non-radioactive - forms by irradiation. In Japan, reference to P&T technology for long-lived and other nuclides first appeared in the Long-Term Program for Nuclear Research, Development and Utilization (or "long-term nuclear program") back in 1972. That program noted the need for research and development in order to ensure effective processing of radioactive waste. Under that program, in 1988, the Atomic Energy Commission's Advisory Committee on Radioactive Waste Measures issued a report entitled, "Long-Term Program for Research and Development on Nuclide Partitioning and Transmutation Technology."(1) This can be considered to have been the first systematic R&D program on P&T technology in Japan. It presented a plan for R&D that ran from 1988 to 2000 and was divided into two phases: Phase I, covering the first four to nine years, which included evaluation of various concepts and R&D on key technologies; and Phase II, covering the next four to nine years, which included engineering experiments on key technologies and demonstrations. The Atomic Energy Commission's Advisory Committee on Nuclear Fuel Cycle Back-End Policy investigated and considered matters concerning P&T technology for long-lived and other nuclides, based on the evaluation schedule stated in the long-term nuclear program issued in 1994. The Committee issued a report entitled, "Research and Development in Japan on Long-Lived Nuclide Partitioning and Transmutation Technology" in March, 2000. The outline of this report is as follows.

Feasibility design studies have been conducting to investigate the characteristics of a fast reactor core with TRU and LLFP transmutation. It was reconfirmed that the fast reactor has a strong potential for transmuting TRU and LLFP, effectively. R&D for establishing partitioning process of TRU apart from the high-level radioactive wastes have been carried out. By several counter-current runs of the TRUEX process using highly active raffinates, a process flow sheet capable of selective partitioning of actinides and fission products was newly developed. JNC has settled a new R&D program concerning partitioning and transmutation of long-lived radioactive waste based on recommendation of check & review for OMEGA program performed by the Ad Hoc Committee under the Atomic Energy Commission of Japan (AEC). The R&D program is composed of the design studies and development of element technologies (fabrication, irradiation) in the "Feasibility Studies" on commercialized fast reactor system and the basic studies with experiments (nuclear data, reactor physics, fuel property, etc.) to establish database and analytical tools for the TRU- and LLFP- containing fuel and core design.

Establishment of Self-Consistent Nuclear Energy System, that simultaneously meets four requirements - energy production, fuel production, burning of radionuclides and safety, strongly relies on the neutron excess generation. Implementation of external non-fission based neutron sources into fission energy system would open the possibility of approaching the Multi-Component Self-Consistent Nuclear Energy System (MC-SCNES) with unlimited fuel resources and zero radioactivity release. This provides strong evidence that nuclear energy could be considered as a base for the future sustainable growth in long perspective. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Since the motivations of national programs are often different, due to a different context, we will take for granted that transmutation is generally seen as an option for the back-end of the fuel cycle in order to reduce the burden of potential geological storages of radioactive wastes (whatever their nature). Finally, we also acknowledge the fact that some highly respected scientists have at several occasions during this decade expressed their doubts about the value of the transmutation option. A typical example is the position expressed by Pigford and Rasmussen, reporting the results of a study for the US National Research Council (IAEA Tec DOC 990, 2/12/1997).

Studies at JAERI include a design study of dedicated transmutation systems both of an MA burner fast reactor (ABR) and an accelerator-driven subcritical system (ADS), and the development of a high intensity proton accelerator as well as the development of partitioning process, nitride fuel fabrication/dry separation process technologies and nuclear data studies. During the course of studies, JAERI developed the concept of the double-strata fuel cycle, in which a dedicated system is used for transmutation. Comparing the various transmutation systems, such as thermal neutron spectrum or fast neutron spectrum systems, power reactors or dedicated systems, from the viewpoints of reactor physics, nuclear fuel cycle and socio-technical issues, it was concluded that the ADS is the best option for transmutation of minor actinide(MA). JAERI, therefore, decided to concentrate its R&D efforts on the development of ADS and related technologies. One of the goals of R&D is to provide a basis for designing demonstration facilities of ADS, aqueous partitioning process and nitride fuel fabrication and dry separation technologies. As the initial step toward this purpose, the construction of an ADS experimental facility is planned under the High-Intensity Proton Accelerator Project which JAERI and the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) are jointly proposing since 1998. The paper discusses the some of the results of P&T studies and the outline of the High-Intensity Proton Accelerator Project under which ADS experimental facility will be constructed.

J	Ohe, T				Ohe, T			Simple assignment of Partitioning & Transmutation objectives to reduce the overall repository impacts due to thermal load and nuclide migration	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd Fujihara International Seminar of the Tokyo-Institute-of-Technology-on-Advanced-Nuclear-Energy-Systems Towards Zero Release of Radioactive Wastes	NOV 06-09, 2000	SUSONO, JAPAN	Tokyo Inst Technol Adv Nucl Energy Syst				Partitioning & Transmutation (P&T) technique is considered to reduce the potential radiotoxicity in high-level radioactive waste (HLW) disposal. The goal of the P&T process such as decontamination factors, transmutation rates, are often assigned from the hazard indices (HI) but not fully investigated from a view point of the radiological impact so far. It is pointed out that the removal and reduction of the insoluble nuclide such as Np-237 is insensitive to the total dose for the most probable scenario of. the nuclide migration in underground water. This contradiction is caused by the difference of the performance measures used in the safety analysis of disposal (Dose) and P&T design procedures (111). Simple analyses were thus conducted to assign the practical goal of the P&T to improve the repository performance. (1) As for partitioning, the nuclides were classified into several groups of similar properties of thermal load, migration impact, and chemical behavior. Then optimal nuclide groups were extracted using the cluster analysis of the above-mentioned factors. (2) For transmutation, the limit nuclide inventories corresponding to the 1 ALI/y hazard were calculated by assuming simplified geosphere conditions. The biosphere conditions were neglected to avoid the uncertainty of the parameters but the figures are easily converted to the dose rate afterwards by employing an appropriate biosphere model. The proposed nuclide grouping and the limit inventories are completely independent from process availability of P&T and purely reflect the factors affecting the repository performance. The comparison between the proposal and the existent P&T examples would resolve the contradiction and bring harmonized connection between the HLW disposal and the PT.

(2) Nearly constant fissile fuel contents and k(eff). (3) No on-site refueling and fueling hardware. (4) The ENHS modules are factory manufactured and transported already fueled to the site. (5) No access to neutrons. (6) No mechanical connections between the ENHS module and the energy conversion plant (The ENHS module has the function of a nuclear battery - with 20 years of full power operation at 125 MWth). (7) At end of life, the ENHS module serves as a spent fuel storage cask and, later, as a spent fuel shipping cask. That is, the fuel is locked inside the ENHS from "cradle to grave". (8) 100% natural circulation resulting in passive load following capability and autonomous control. This combination of features offers a highly safe nuclear energy system that is characterized by low waste, high proliferation resistance and high uranium utilization. The low waste and high uranium ore utilization are achieved by recycling the Pu and MA many times using a proliferation-resistant dry process; only fission products are to be extracted between cycles. Spent LWR fuel can provide for the HM make-up. The high level of proliferation resistance is obtained by restricting access to the fuel and neutrons and by eliminating the economic incentive of the client country to invest in sensitive technologies or infrastructure that can be used for clandestine production of strategic nuclear materials.

The following conclusions have been derived: 1. When the reprocessing with very small leakage rate can be employed, the conventional fast reactor has a potential to confine all actinides in the core. 2. The total toxicity of LLFPs is smaller but comparable to the toxicity of burned natural uranium with its daughters. 3. When the isotope separation is employed for each LLFP, whole LLFPs can be incinerated using the conventional fast reactor system with natural uranium. 4. When only the element separation is employed, the incineration of Pd-107 should be given up even by employing several design changes, but its toxicity is only 0.0002 of the incinerated uranium toxicity.

J	Kitamoto, A; Setiawan, MB				Kitamoto, A; Setiawan, MB			Recycle transmutation of MA and LLFP using BWR for sustaining geologic disposal	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd Fujihara International Seminar of the Tokyo-Institute-of-Technology-on-Advanced-Nuclear-Energy-Systems Towards Zero Release of Radioactive Wastes	NOV 06-09, 2000	SUSONO, JAPAN	Tokyo Inst Technol Adv Nucl Energy Syst				The actinides and fission products produced in nuclear fuels constitute an important part of the HLW. Therefore, methods for reducing the radiotoxicity of the MA and LLFP in HLW are presently under investigation. The purposes of this study are to evaluate the effectiveness of MA transmutation by taking advantage of neutron spectrum hardening due to void fraction along BWR axial direction; to understand the effectiveness of LLFP transmutation in BWR considering the large capture cross section of FP in thermal region; and to evaluate the macroscopic characteristics of longer residential period of LLFP target in the high burnup BWR core. Conceptual B/T BWR supposed in this study was reactor which the performance comparable to the current BWR. In MA transmutation case, the calculation was focused on varying the void fraction of 0 to 40% along the axial direction, which were directly associated to the lower and upper region of the BWR core. The performance of B/T BWR was evaluated in which four components of MA ( Np-237, Am-241, Am-243, and Cm-244) with fixed fraction were blended with UO2 in B/T fuel. While, for LLFP transmutation, the B/T BWR was assumed to have two homogeneous regions: {1} the region for UO2 driver fuel (99% of fuel weight), and {2} the region for LLFP ( Tc-99 and I-129) target capsules (1% of fuel weight), in which metallic Tc rods and iodine in the form of CeI3 was contained in cylindrical target capsules. The evaluation functions are {1} fission-to-transmutation ratio, [F/T ratio](MA), and {2}transmutation fraction, TFLLFP. Results show that the hardening neutron spectrum due to increase of void fraction in B/T BWR would result a higher [F/T ratio] of MA transmutation performance. Np and Am would be effectively loaded in the upper region of the core, while Cm could be loaded in any region of the core. At the. EOC of equal or more than 50 GWd/Mg(HM), technetium has a higher transmutation fraction compared to iodine. To obtain higher LLFP transmutation fraction, the residential time in the LLFP targets in the core, should be kept for long time, for instance about 10 to 30 years. For that purpose, it was proposed that the number of B/T BWR system for LLFP treatment corresponds to the residential time of the LLFP target, i.e. 10 to 3 0 units.

In this feature, the existing light-water reactors (LWRs) cycle will be main stream for nuclear electric generation during a long-term period more than 50 years, and Pu will be utilized in mixed oxide fuel (MOX)-LWRs. In future, when Pu recycling system will be achived by introducing high-conversion LWRs (HCLWRs) and/or fast breeder reactors (FBRs), the accelerator driven transmutation system (ADS) transmutes Pu, MA and Iodine from Purex or Dry reprocessing. This is due to reduce burden for transmuting the excess or remained Pu, MA and LLFP by commercial reactor plants in Pu-recycling system. For this purpose, we introduce a concept of symbiosis system for transmutation based on nitride fuel FBR and ADS. The core design for lead-bismuth (Pb-Bi) cooled FBRs and ADS, Pb-Bi technologies, 15N enrichment and 14C toxicity are studied. And the mass flows for MA and Iodine are discussed based on an estimated scenario for nuclear electric plants introduction in future. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Wade, DC; Yang, WS; Khalil, H				Wade, DC; Yang, WS; Khalil, H			ATW neutronics design studies	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd Fujihara International Seminar of the Tokyo-Institute-of-Technology-on-Advanced-Nuclear-Energy-Systems Towards Zero Release of Radioactive Wastes	NOV 06-09, 2000	SUSONO, JAPAN	Tokyo Inst Technol Adv Nucl Energy Syst				The Accelerator Transmutation of Waste (ATW) concept has been proposed as a transuranics (TRU) (and long-lived fission product) incinerator for processing the 87,000 metric tonnes of Light Water Reactor (LWR) used fuel which will have been generated by the time the currently deployed fleet of commercial reactors in the US reach the end of their licensed lifetime. The ATW is proposed to separate the uranium from the transuranics and fission products in the LWR used fuel, to fission the transuranics, to send the LWR and ATW generated fission products to the geologic repository and to send the uranium to either a low level waste disposal site or to save it for future use. The heat liberated in fissioning the transuranics would be converted to electricity and sold to partially offset the cost of ATW construction and operations. Options for incineration of long-lived fission products are under evaluation. A six-year science-based program of ATW trade and system studies was initiated in the US FY 2000 to achieve two main purposes: (1) "to evaluate ATW within the framework of nonproliferation, waste management, and economic considerations," and (2) "to evaluate the efficacy of the numerous technical options for ATW system configuration." This paper summarizes the results from neutronics and thermal/hydraulics trade studies which were completed at Argonne National Laboratory during the first year of the program. Core designs were developed for Pb-Bi eutectic (LBE) cooled and Na cooled 840 MWth fast spectrum transmuter designs employing recycle. Additionally, neutronics analyses were performed at Argonne for a He cooled 600 MWth hybrid thermal and fast core design proposed by General Atomics Co. which runs critical for 3/4 and subcritical for 1/4 of its four year once-thru burn cycle. The mass flows and the ultimate loss of transuranic isotopes to the waste stream per unit of heat generated during transmutation have been calculated on a consistent basis and are compared.

J	Walters, LC; Porter, DL; Crawford, DC				Walters, LC; Porter, DL; Crawford, DC			Nuclear fuel considerations for the 21st century	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd Fujihara International Seminar of the Tokyo-Institute-of-Technology-on-Advanced-Nuclear-Energy-Systems Towards Zero Release of Radioactive Wastes	NOV 06-09, 2000	SUSONO, JAPAN	Tokyo Inst Technol Adv Nucl Energy Syst				There are many external influences that may control the path that nuclear power deployment follows. In the next 50 years several events may unfold. Fear of the consequences of the greenhouse effect may produce a carbon tax that would make nuclear power economically superior very quickly. This, in turn, would increase the rate at which uranium reserves diminish due to the increased rate of nuclear power deployment. However, breakthroughs in the extraction of uranium from the sea of deployment of fast breeder reactors would greatly extend the uranium reserves and, as well, utilize the thorium cycle. On the other hand, carbon sequestering technology breakthroughs could keep fossil fuels dominant for the remainder of the century. Nuclear power may only then continue, as today, in a lesser role or even diminish. Fusion power or new developments in solar power could completely displace nuclear power as we know it today. Even more difficult to predict is when the demand for mobile fuel for transportation will develop such that hydrogen and hydrogen rich fuel cells will be in common use. When this happens, nuclear power may be the energy source of choice to produce this fuel from water or methane. In a similar vein, the demand for potable and irrigation water may be another driver for the advent of increased deployment of nuclear power. With all these possibilities of events that could happen it appears impossible to predict with any certainty which path nuclear power deployment may take. However, it is necessary to define a strategy that is flexible enough to insure that when a technology is needed, it is ready to be deployed. For the next few decades there will be an evolutionary improvement in the performance of uranium oxide and mixed uranium oxide-plutonium oxide (MOX) LWR fuels. These improvements will be market driven to keep the cost of fuel and the resulting cost of nuclear power electricity as competitive as possible. The development of fuels for accelerator transmutation and for reactor transmutation with inert matrix fuels is in its infancy. A great deal of research has been initiated in a number of countries, which has been summarized in recent conferences. In Europe the work on these fuels is directed at the same problem as their utilization of MOX; namely to reduce the inventory of separated plutonium, minor actinides, and Long Lived Fission Products (LLFP). In the United States there is no reprocessing and thus no inventory of separated civilian plutonium. However, in the United States there is a resistance to a permanent spent fuel repository and thus accelerator transmutation presents a possible alternative. If nuclear power does have a long-term future, then the introduction of the fast reactor is inevitable. Included in the mission of the fast reactors would be the elimination of the inventory of separated plutonium while generating useful energy. The work that is ongoing now on the development of fuel concepts for assemblies that, contain actinides and LLFP would be useful for fast reactor transmutation. There is still a great deal of work required to bring the fast breeder reactor option to maturity. Fortunately there is perhaps a fifty-year period to accomplish this work before fast breeders are necessary. With regard to fast reactor fuel development, future work should be considered in three stages. First, all the information obtained over the past forty years of fast reactor fuel development should be completely documented in a manner that future generations can readily retrieve and utilize the information. Fast reactor development came to such an abrupt halt world-wide that a great deal of information is in danger of being lost because most of the researchers and facilities are rapidly disappearing. Secondly, for all of the existing fast reactor fuels, and this includes, oxides, carbides, nitrides, and metallic fuels, the evolutionary work was far from being completed. Although mixed oxide fuels were probably the furthest advanced, there were many concepts for improved claddings and advanced fabrication methods that were never fully explored. Finally, with such an extended period before fast reactors are needed there is ample time for truly innovative fuels to be developed that are capable of performing over a wide range of conditions and coolants.

The target waste considered was the acidic raffinate (HAR) issuing the reprocessing of the used nuclear fuels by the PUREX process. A two step separation process based on liquid-liquid extraction was designed. The first step consists in the co-separation of the mixture of trivalent actinides and lanthanides from the HAR by extraction with a malonamide extractant (DIAMEX process), while the second step concerns the actinides(III)/lanthanides(III) group separation (SANEX process). Several DIAMEX and SANEX processes were developed and successfully tested with cold, spiked and genuine high active effluents. The research carried out also included basic and fundamental works in order to. better understand the relationships between the structures of the extractants and their affinities for the target metal ions. The lecture highlighted both the basic and applied aspects of the research. This work will be pursued (PARTNEW program) within the 5(th) FWP of the European Union during the period 2000-2003.

The rad.-waste fractionation is in accordance with the present society's trend toward zero-emission, and the mean of salt-free method utilizing electrochemistry. agrees with the principles of the newly established green chemistry. A catalytic electrolytic extraction method is proposed to separate the target, radioactive but potentially strategic elements, Pd, Ru, Rh, Re (Tc), Te and Se dissolved in the HLLW. It avoids secondary waste arising. This method is particularly feasible for the separation of Pd where cyclic reaction of metal cations such as Pd(II) or Fe(II), acting as promoters or mediators and already contained in HLLW, accelerates the electrochemical deposition of Ru, Rh and Re. Elemental separation not only offers alternative material resources to meet expanding demands for catalysts in Fuel Cell / Soft Energy system but is also the first step for transmutation or other selective strategies for waste management of long-lived fission products (LLFP).

J	Ogawa, T				Ogawa, T			Transmutation of minor actinides and innovative fuel cycle concepts	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd Fujihara International Seminar of the Tokyo-Institute-of-Technology-on-Advanced-Nuclear-Energy-Systems Towards Zero Release of Radioactive Wastes	NOV 06-09, 2000	SUSONO, JAPAN	Tokyo Inst Technol Adv Nucl Energy Syst				Both physical and chemical properties of actinides show significant variations depending on the element from uranium to curium. The materials database on minor actinides (MA:Np, Am, Cm) is very limited. Even with the scanty database, however, americium and curium did not appear to make viable fuels in the ordinary sense. The solutions may be (1) to tolerate a significantly lower fuel performance whose penalty has to be recovered by an improved overall economy of the MA-fuel cycle, and/or (2) to make a fuel concept whose performance is less restricted by physical and chemical properties of MA. In such a difficult program like actinide burning, the technology components would have to be combined by a modular approach. The system has to be integrated as a whole, but a technological module in the system has to be made as such that can be replaced by the other modules. This type of approach would be only possible if we have a technology which forms a common basis to these "modules". The advantage of taking the modular approach is to allow the system to evolve with time. The pyrochemical separation can form such a common basis. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Not only economic advantage but also environmental safety and strong resistance for proliferation are required for the fuel cycle. In order to satisfy the requirement, actinides recycling applicable to LWR and FBR cycles by pyro-process has been developed since more than ten years in CRIEPI. The main technology is electrorefining for U and Pu separation and reductive-extraction for TRU separation, which can be applied on oxide fuels through reduction process as well as metal fuels. The application of this technology on separation of TRU in HLLW through chlorination could contribute to the improvement of public acceptance on the geologic disposal. The main achievements are summarized as follows: The elemental technologies, such as electrorefining, reductive extraction, injection casting and salt waste treatment and solidification, have been developed successfully with lots of experiments The fuel dissolution into molten salt and uranium recovery on solid cathode for electrorefining have been demonstrated by engineering scale facility in Argonne National Laboratory by using spent fuels and in CRIEPI by uranium tests. Single element tests, using actinides, showed the Li reduction to be technically feasible, remaining the subjects of technical feasibility on multi-elements system and on effective recycle of Li by electrolysis of Li2O. Concerning on the treatment of HLLW for actinide separation, the conversion to chlorides through oxides has been also established through uranium tests. It is confirmed that more than 99% of TRU nuclides can be recovered from the high level liquid waste by TRU tests - Through these studies, the process flow sheets for reprocessing of metal and oxide fuels and for partitioning of TRU separation have been established. The subjects to be emphasized for further development are classified into three categories, that is, process development (demonstration), technology for engineering development, and supplemental technology. The metal fuel FBR has a high potential for recycling actinides by integration with pyro-reprocessing. Alloys of U-Pu-Zr with minor actinides are investigated from points of fuel properties. The miscibility and other characteristics suggest that the maximum content up to ca. 5 wt% of minor actinides is allowable in the matrix. Nine pins of metal fuel including minor actinides are ready for irradiation at Phenix fast reactor. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In order to realize the. SCNES, material separation, isotope separation of the FP's and future subjects to-be solved are discussed. In this paper we discuss about the required energy for a scheme of atomic vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS) of FP's, the practical isotope separation system and the combination of AVLIS, plasma separation process and gas centrifugation methods for SCNES. And also we discuss about the future subject to guide to shift to SCNES smoothly in future concerning with waste management in the intermediate period to the SCNES. Consequently, the SCNES can be the ultimate goal of the nuclear energy development and it is very important to make effort to development in the intermediate period to SCNES.

J	Fujimura, K; Sanda, T; Moro, S; Saito, M; Sekimoto, H				Fujimura, K; Sanda, T; Moro, S; Saito, M; Sekimoto, H			Feasibility study of large MOX fueled FBR core and applicability of various coolants and fuels aimed at the self-consistent nuclear energy system	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd Fujihara International Seminar of the Tokyo-Institute-of-Technology-on-Advanced-Nuclear-Energy-Systems Towards Zero Release of Radioactive Wastes	NOV 06-09, 2000	SUSONO, JAPAN	Tokyo Inst Technol Adv Nucl Energy Syst				The potential of a large MOX fueled fast breeder reactor (FBR) is evaluated with regard to its ability to transmute radioactive nuclides and its safety when incorporated in the self-consistent nuclear energy system (SCNES). The FBR's annual production amounts of selected long-lived fission products (LLFPs), Se-79, Tc-99, Pd-107, I-129, Cs-135 and Sm-151, can be transmuted by using a radial blanket region and part of a lower axial blanket region without any significant impact on the reactor's nuclear and safety characteristics. The other LLFPs; are confined in the system. The hazard index level of the LLFPs per one ton of spent fuel from the system after 1000 years is as small as that of a typical uranium ore. To realize self-controllability (passive safety), the proposed FBR core concept employs gas expansion modules and a sodium plenum above the core. To realize self-terminability, even if MOX fuel melting should cause a core compaction, re-criticality of the core can be avoided by a fuel dilution and relocation module. The results show the MOX fueled FBR core has potential applicability to the SCNES. The fundamental applicability of various coolants and fuels is evaluated based on neutron balance toward the final goal of the ideal SCNES. The results show that gas coolant has a potential for increasing the transmutation efficiency of LLFPs. And an improved SCNES with several conventional FBRs and a FP transmutation reactor is also studied. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Their transmutation has been of high priority to reduce the long-term consequences of nuclear energy generation. A self-consistent nuclear energy system (SCNES) in which we center fast breeder reactor may not have enough degree of excess neutron sources to transmute the fission products that potentially would poses environmental hazards in long-term period if they are buried in geologic disposal. Here we propose a so-called multicomponent SCNES in which fission reactor systems can be combined with fusion reactor systems mainly for compensating the loss of enough capability for the transmutation. Amongst long-lived fission products, major concern has been paid for iodine and technetium and little attention was given to radioactive Zr-93, although its hazard appears to be rather substantial. The importance of Zr-93 transmutation is emphasized and the transmutation capability was examined with fusion neutron sources by incorporating adequate moderation structures. As a result, we have demonstrated that the fusion neutron sources with high-flux blanket can be applied to transmute Zr-93 sufficiently and resolve the problem of its accumulation within the time period of several decades.

These values are one to three orders of magnitude lower than the value currently accepted for the radiation-enhanced diffusion coefficient. The time required to reach the steady-state concentration depends on the local fission rate, the grain size distribution and the precise magnitude of the radiation-enhanced diffusion coefficient, and can take from 2 to 10 years. Additional calculations reveal that substantially less than 10% of the fission gas inventory is released from the original UO2 grains in the outer region of the fuel prior to recrystallisation. In contrast, with a diffusion coefficient of 10(-22) m(2) s(-1) more than 80% of the fission gas is released from the recrystallised grains of the high burn-up structure in one year.

Irradiation was observed to enhance the rate of decomposition without modifying the mechanism of the thermal decomposition. Thermal decomposition of dysposium acetate is shown to proceed by a nucleation and growth mechanism (Avarmi-Erofe'ev equation) both for un-irradiated and pre-gamma-irradiated samples. The enhancement of the decomposition was found to increase with an increase in the gamma-ray dose applied to the sample and may be attributed to an increase in point defects and formation of additional nucleation centers generated in the host lattice. Thermodynamic values of the main decomposition process were calculated and evaluated.

Two paramagnetic centers are produced: the first one with an axial <111> symmetry is similar to the trigonal Zr3+ electron center (T center) found after X-ray irradiation or thermo-chemical reduction, whereas the second one is a new oxygen hole center with an axial <100> symmetry different from the orthorhombic O- center induced by X-ray irradiation. At a fluence around 10(18) e/cm(2) , both centers are bleached out near 600 K, like the corresponding X-ray induced defects. At a fluence around 10(19) e/cm(2) , defects are much more stable, since complete thermal bleaching occurs near 1000 K. Accordingly, ageing of as-irradiated samples shows that high-dose defects at more stable than the low-dose ones.

This outstanding feature of zircon turns out to be extremely useful when this mineral is applied as a thermoluminescence (TL) dating medium, because the build-up of the age-dependent luminescence is dominated by the presence of well-defined internal radioactive sources and the contributions to the dose from external radiation sources are two orders of magnitude smaller. The results presented in this paper have led us to the conclusion that for zircon dating it is necessary to carefully select the best and homogeneous zircon grains of the highest optical quality. For successful dating experiments on very young and historically well-defined coastal dune sands, selection of the most stable luminescence component by means of narrow band interference filters is needed.

At present, however, the Municipality of Russaifa City used these sites as common public places of animal Zoo and General Park. The absorbed dose rate in air due to U-238 varies from 20.6 to 223.4 nGy h(-1), the dose rate due to Th-232 varies from 5.8 to 17.9 nGy h(-)1. The dose rate due to K-40 is in the range 1.9-13.2 nGy h(-1). The obtained values are comparable to worldwide values. However, the results indicate that the activities of natural radionuclides in samples obtained from the mine areas are higher than those of other sites, consequently, increasing the population dose rate.

Some experimental data obtained from this special individual monitoring during the past 20 years are presented and discussed in this paper. Our experience suggests the following conclusions. The daily plutonium excretion rate, normalised to the total excretion for the first 5 days after inhalation, was approximately in agreement with the latest ICRP 78 dosimetric model. Maximum faecal excretion is observed on the second day after inhalation of plutonium compounds. On the other hand, the activity ratio for total alpha activity observed in early faeces to that detected in nasal swabs showed a wide distribution range, and it was proven that variations in this ratio followed a log-normal distribution. The logarithmic mean probability is about 2.1 for PuO2 and about 15.7 for Pu(NO3)(4). In practice, a conservative dose assessment from nasal swabs can be performed on the basis of these experimental ratios.

It has been identified as a high background radiation area through aerial geological surveys conducted in late 1970s. The ambient gamma dose in the area was measured with the aid of a hand-held dose rate meter (Mini-Rad, Series 1000) and the surface rock samples were collected and analysed for their radioactivity content using a high-resolution gamma spectrometry equipped with HPGe with relative efficiency of 18%. The activity concentrations of (238)U, (232)Th and (40)K were found to range from 39-253 Bq.kg(-1), 41-527 Bq.kg(-1) and 77-3027 Bq.kg(-1), respectively. From the values of the standard deviation it was concluded that the activity concentration of the considered primordial radionuclides was highly scattered (localised) which in turn indicates non-uniformity in the geological features and/or formations. (238)U activity concentration corresponds to equivalent mass concentration of 7.77 +/- 6.12 ppm (3.19-20.73 ppm), which is of no economic importance. Samples are enriched in thorium relative to uranium as reflected by the Th:U mass ratio which ranges from 3 to 17. The absorbed dose rate in air as estimated from the measured activity concentrations of the primordial radionuclides using the DRCFs (dose rate conversion factors) falls within the range of 70-522 nGy.h(-1) with an average of 221 +/- 130 nGy.h(-1). It corresponds to an annual effective dose equivalent averaged of 0.27 mSv. The regression analysis has shown that the correlation between calculated and the measured ambient dose rate is marginally significant (r(2) = 0.59). The (232)Th series is the major producer of the surface radioactivity followed by (40)K as they contribute 48% and 32% of the total absorbed dose, respectively.

Poor correlation to both aquifer geology and bedrock radioactivity was observed. Concentrations of U-238, Ra-226, Ra-228, Rn-222 and Po-210 in groundwater samples was in the ranges <0.027-5.3, <0.016-4.9, <0.014-1.24, 5-8105 and < 0.05-0/947 Bq.l(-1) respectively. In about 80% of the sites the radon concentration exceeds the Nordic recommended exemption level for radon in drinking water and 15% of the sites exceed the action limit. The effective doses from ingestion were calculated and presented in association with geology. Doses due to ingestion ranged between 0.05 and 20.4 mSv y(-1), where the average contribution from Rn-222 amounted to 75%. In comparison, the effective doses from inhalation of indoor Rn-222 ranged between 0.2 and 20 mSv.y(-1). The average contribution from inhalation of Rn-222 in air to the total effective dose (ingestion+inhalation) was 58 +/ 22%. 73 +/- 18% amd 77 +/- 16% (1 SD) for the age categories 1 y, 10 y and adults respectively.

Recently, on the other hand, uncertainties in the ICRP's models and parameters are under consideration because of the paucity of human data. In addition, there is a possibility of variation between individuals. A code has been developed to reproduce the ICRP's dose coefficients and excretion rates for Pu-239, which is one of the most important elements for occupational exposure. By using this code, the respective transfer rates for the ICRP Publication 67 biokinetic model were modified, and the effect owing to these changes on present hazard assessment was investigated. As a result, it was shown that dose estimates for workers exposed to Pu-239 were not very sensitive to changes in these transfer rates.

The inhabitants of the upper Techa river settlements received significant doses of external radiation. The majority of the houses in the upper Techa river villages were demolished after the evacuation of the Population in 1956. Only three buildings (red-brick construction) in the former village of Metlino call still be used for thermoluminescence (TL) investigations in an external dose reconstruction study. The radiation source Configuration changed in 1956 after all artificial reservoir was created next to Metlinsky pond. Preliminary TL Studies showed good properties of the bricks that were sampled from the buildings. This paper presents all analysis of new results of TL investigations obtained oil the samples collected from different walls of the buildings. The highest dose values in the range 1-4 Gy were found in bricks collected front the walls of building exposed to the artificial reservoir (Reservoir-10) and values of 1-1.5 Gy were found next to the Metlinsky pond shoreline. The measurements of the radiation source geometry were carried Out simultaneously with the dose rates, radionuclide concentration in water and bottom sediments near the wall facing the old river bed. The measurements allow a validation of models used in the current Techa River Dosimetry System (TRDS-2000) to estimate external doses of tile former inhabitants of the upper Techa riverside. In particular, the results call be applied for a more correct description Of the source geometry in the settlement.

These doses are usually measured by using individual film dosemeters. Lead or lead glass shields used during the handling of radioisotopes minimise the whole-body doses received. Nevertheless, part of the job has to be performed manually, hence the hands are more exposed to radiation. This paper presents the results of measuring the equivalent dose to the hands of workers employed in five selected nuclear medicine laboratories where technetium and iodine radioisotopes are in common use. Sixty workers, including physicians, nurses, radiopharniacists and technicians, were included in the study. Doses were measured at I month intervals. The stud indicated that, in some instances, the danger of radiation dose to the hand may be significant. Monthly doses exceeded 50 mSv, which may suggest that an annual dose may be higher than 500 mSv.

These unsealed sources are administered in various forms to patients, who remain radioactive for hours or days, and represent a source of potential radiation exposure for others. Thus, in nuclear medicine departments, radiation protection of workers and members of the public must take this exposure into account. In this context, the aim of this work was the investigation of maximum dose levels to which people accompanying patients are exposed. For monitoring, thermoluminescence dosemeters were given to 380 people in three nuclear medicine departments in Brazil. Exposure results are given, and issues regarding length of stay of members of the public in those departments are discussed.

The teeth used in this study were collected front members of the Techa river population who were exposed to radiation as a result of releases of the Mayak plutonium production facilities (Southern Urals-Russia) between 1949 and 1956. The beta dose rates from different parts of the tooth (enamel. crown dentine, and root) were determined by storing the detectors over the samples in a shielded environment. The Cumulative dose measured by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) in different dental tissues is found to be proportional to current dose rate obtained front alpha-Al2O3:C thermoluminescence dosemeters. The retention of Sr-90 in various parts of the teeth is discussed.

However, unheated materials such as mortar and concrete are more commonly found in industrial sites and particularly in nuclear installations. These materials contain natural dosemeters Such as quartz. which usually is less sensitive than its heated counterpart. The potential of quartz extracted from mortar in a wall of a low-level radioactive-waste storage facility containing distributed sources of Co-60 and Cs-137 has been investigated. Dose-depth profiles based on small aliquots and single grains from the quartz extracted from the mortar samples are reported here. These are compared with results from heated quartz and polymineral fine grains extracted from an adjacent brick, and the integrated dose recorded by environmental TLDs.

When the filling gas is deuterium, neutrons can be obtained from fusion reactions. These are partially due to a beam of deuterons which are accelerated against the background hot plasma by large electric fields originating front plasma instabilities. Due to a beam-target effect, the angular distribution of the neutron emission is anisotropic, peaked in the forward direction along the axis of the gun. The purpose of this work is to illustrate the use of CR-39 nuclear track detectors as a diagnostic tool in the determination of the time-integrated neutron angular distribution. For the case studied in this work, neutron emission is found to have a 70% contribution from isotropic radiation and a 30% contribution from anisotropic radiation.

In these facilities, bentonite will be subjected to a gradient of temperature and dose rate, achieving a very high integrated dose and, therefore, changes in its structure and physical properties may take place. Two experiments to discriminate between the thermal and the irradiation effect were performed. In the first (named BIC 2A), samples were subjected to temperature while in the second (named BIC-2B) the combined effect of temperature and irradiation was studied. The experimental conditions were: a thermal gradient between 130 C and 90 C, a maximum dose rate of 3.5 kGy.h(-1) and a gradient of the integrated dose between 1.75 MGy and 10 MGy. Both experiments lasted a total of 124 days. An irradiation source of Co-60 with an activity close to 300,000 Ci, and bentonite samples of 200 mm in length and 50 mm in diameter were used. After the experiment, the samples were ground and two fractions were obtained: a fine fraction (<2 mum) enriched in montmorillonite clay mineral and a coarse fraction (>80 mum). The results are described of thermoluminescence analyses on the two fractions obtained which showed that the coarse fraction can be 100 times more sensitive to radiation than the fine fraction. On the other hand, the heated and irradiated samples showed a thermoluminescence response around 50 times greater than the samples that were only heated. In addition to this, the temperature and dose rate conditions are relevant parameters in the generation and stabilisation of radiation induced defects. Finally, the response of samples heated and irradiated for two months was quite similar to that obtained on samples heated and irradiated for four months, indicating a saturation phenomenon.

J	Moiseenko, VV; Karnas, SJ; Yu, E; Battista, JJ				Moiseenko, VV; Karnas, SJ; Yu, E; Battista, JJ			Monte Carlo simulations of DNA damage from incorporated cold iodine following photoelectrically induced Auger electron cascades	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	13th Symposium on Microdosimetry	MAY 27-JUN 01, 2001	STRESA, ITALY				TRITIUM BETA-PARTICLES; PHOTONS	Radiation-induced damage in nucleosomal DNA from Auger electron cascades due to incorporated Cold IUdR has been modelled through Monte Carlo simulations. Probabilities of DNA double strand break (DSB) production following a vacancy in the K, L, M and N shells of iodine are estimated. DSB complexity from the base damage accompanying a break was also estimated. Multiple DSB events were analysed for correlated breaks due to nucleosome periodicity The probability of an Auger cascade causing at least one DSB strongly depended on the shell in which the initial vacancy was produced. This probability was approximately 0.35 for K and L shells and fell to 0.02 for the N shell. As expected. DSB were predominantly induced in a nucleosome containing incorporated iodine and were accompanied with extensive base damage. Analysis of multiple DSB events showed that approximately 14% of the DSBs produced following a vacancy in the L1 orbital can be interpreted as correlated with base pair separation attributable to the nucleosome periodicity. The data generated in this work provide a basis for the development of photon-activation therapy using kilovoltage X rays incident upon IUdR sensitised tumours.

The frequency of micronucleus formation was 1.6-3.0%, for unirradiated subjects but increased for irradiated ones in a dose-dependent manner, A linear relationship between the dose and the micronucleus formation was observed until 1 Gy for alpha particles and 4 Gy for X rays. The linear slope for alpha particles was 28.5% per Gy and the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) was 4.3, as calculated from the slopes. The slope for alpha particles was dependent on the energy of the alpha particles. These results indicate that the micronucleus assay is available for biodosimetry of alpha particle irradiation in the rat alveolar epithelial cells. although consideration should be given to the range of the linearity and the LET of alpha particles.

Particles were provided by the accelerators at GSI, Darmstadt, and HMI, Berlin. DNA was separated using pulsed field gel electrophoresis and the intensity of the largest bands used to determine the loss of molecular weight. Since the DNA content of each chromosome is exactly known absolute values for DSB induction can he measured without calibration procedures. Ions used range from protons to uranium with LET values between 2 and about 15.000 keV.mum(-1). Induction cross sections increase in the lower LET region approaching a plateau around 200 keV.mum(-1). With higher LET values the dependence can no longer be described by a common curve with each ion showing a specific behaviour, With very heavy particles the influence of the penumbra becomes obvious cross sections decrease with LET because of the reduced penumbra extensions. Classical target theory would predict cross sections to follow a simple saturation function which is not substantiated by the data, Track structure analysis its introduced by Butts and Katz in 1967 is also not able to predict the experimental results. A semi-empirical fit indicates a linear-quadratic dependence of induction cross sections on LET up to about 1000 keV.mum(-1), RBE for DSB induction rises above unity reaching a maximum of about 2.5 around 200 keV.mum(-1). This is different from many experiments in mammalian cells and is presumably due to differences in chromatin structure since yeast cells seem to lack a functional H1 histone.

Published data front our laboratory have demonstrated that DU exposure in vitro to immortalised human osteoblast cells (HOS) is both neoplastically transforming and genotoxic. DU possesses both a radiological (alpha-particle) and chemical metal) component. Since DU has a low specific activity in comparison to natural uranium, it is not considered to be a significant radiological hazard. The potential contribution of radiation to DU-induced biological effects is unknown and the involvement of radiation in DU-induced biological effects could have significant implications for current risk estimates for internalised DU exposure. Two approaches were used to address this question. The frequency of dicentrics was measured in HOS cells following DU exposure in vitro. Data demonstrated that DU exposure (50 muM. 24 h) induced a significant elevation in dicentric frequency in vitro in contrast to incubution with the heavy metals, nickel and tungsten which did not increase dicentric frequency above background levels. Using the same concentration (50 muM) of three Uranyl nitrate compounds that have different uranium isotopic concentrations and therefore. different specific activities. the effect on neoplastic transformation in vitro was examined. HOS cells were exposed to one of three-uranyl nitrate compounds (U-238-uranyl nitrate, specific activity 0,33 muCi.g(-1) DU-uranyl nitrate, specific activity 0.44 muCi.g(-1) and U-235-uranyl nitrate, specific activity muCi.g(-1)) delivered at a concentration of 50 muM for 24 K Results showed, at equal uranium concentration, there was a specific activity dependent increase in reoplastic transformation frequency. Taken together these data suggest that radiation can play a role in DU-induced biological effects in vitro.

This approach is valid for cases where a convex site is immersed in uniform or discontinuous distributions of heavy charged particle tracks and assumes no restrictions in site geometry or the kind of randomness. These conditions are relevant to the study of microdosimetry in applications such as neutron capture therapy (NCT). irradiation experiments using heavy ion particle beams, environmental radon. or occupational exposure to radioactive materials. Expressions applicable to the case of surface-distributed sources of tracks are presented that may represent situations such Lis NCT. where boron Compounds are bound to the membranes of cellular nuclei. Microdosimetric spectra. specific energy, averages, and mean number of B-10 capture reactions for cell inactivation are calculated, shocking their dependence on B-10 localisation.

However. current lung dosimetry models do not take into consideration the inhomogencity of deposition within the airways. In this study, Computed local distributions of deposited inhaled radionuclides such as radon progenies in morphologically realistic human airway bifurcation models are analysed for different flow, rates and particle sizes. Then. local deposition enhancement factors. defined as the ratio of local to average deposition densities, are computed by scanning along the surface of the bifurcation with pre-specified Surface area elements. Computed enhancement factors indicate that cells located at carinal ridges or at the inner sides of the progeny branches may receive localised doses which are two orders of magnitude higher than the average values.
