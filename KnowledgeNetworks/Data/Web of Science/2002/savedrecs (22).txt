J	Navarrete, M; Gaudry, A; Cabrera, L; Martinez, T				Navarrete, M; Gaudry, A; Cabrera, L; Martinez, T			Concentration of iodine traces in solution by filtering through activated carbon	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							SELENIUM; SAMPLES	The retention of iodine traces (ppb) was investigated in small activated carbon filters (50 mg) from solution at a yielding rate exclusively determined by pH. Retention is approximately 100% at pH values of 4-6, while no retention of iodine traces occurs after filtering them through an activated carbon filter from very acidic and basic solutions (pH values of 1 and 11, respectively) with 0% yielding rate. Since activated carbon is a very pure material this procedure may be an alternative method of the activation analysis of iodine traces in foodstuffs, because the half-life of L-128, formed by (n,gamma) reaction, is only 25 minutes. It does not allow either the sample to be placed readily in solution or the radioisotope to be separated after irradiation with the purpose of attaining maximal accuracy and sensitivity in this type of analysis.

Contamination results from diffusion of Cs, Sr and UO2 into quartz from deposited condensation particles. In laboratory experiments, submicronic condensation particles were deposited onto quartz surfaces and annealed for 3 hours at 700, 900 and 1100 degreesC in different atmospheres. The contamination potential of deposited radioactive material depends on the characteristics of the UO2 particle matrices, on temperature and on the oxidizing potential of the atmosphere in contact.

Natural alpha-emitters of Po, Ra, Th and U are precipitated from solution with sulphuric acid and ammonia. Ba2+ and Fe2+ are used as carriers. The overall yield for all emitters is greater than 80%. This method is faster than the evaporation technique, less dependent on the water composition and a better sensitivity can be achieved by using a large volume sample.

J	Palm, M				Palm, M			The revised German radiation protection ordinance	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article								Since August 2007, German radiation protection law is governed by a new Radiation Protection Ordinance, implementing two new Euratom Directives and taking into account new scientific developments, which provides a comprehensive basis for the protection of man and the environment. The Ordinance has been completely re-structured, however, it is still a very complex piece of legislation comprising 118 provisions and 14 annexes, some of them highly technical. Reduced dose limits for occupationally exposed persons and members of the public, a detailed provision on clearance of radioactive substances, a new part aiming at the protection of man and the environment against ionising radiation emanating from natural sources, and regulations dealing with the protection of consumers in connection with the addition of radioactive substances to consumer goods arc some of the centre pieces of the new legislation which shall contribute significantly to the further prevention or at least minimisation of the adverse effects of radiation exposure.

A distinction is made between unconditional clearance and cases of clearance in which disposal, recycling, and re-use is prescribed. The focus of attention in the case of unconditional clearance consists in special consideration of large volumes of building rubble and excavated soil. Material can only be released front supervision under the Atomic Energy Act, when the radiation-related risk, and correspondingly, also the dose from material issued with clearance, are at negligible levels. In order to facilitate the practical application of clearance, values have been derived on the basis of scenarios which cover all radiation exposures which can reasonably be considered.

J	Ettenhuber, E				Ettenhuber, E			New regulations for the protection of man and the environment against natural sources of radiation.	KERNTECHNIK			German	Article								The Council directive 96/29/Euratom issued on May 13, 1996, laying down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers from ionising radiation, requires that the Member States of the EU make provisions for radiation protection measures relating to natural sources of radiation - even when their radioactive characteristics are not used - in cases where exposures due to natural radiation are significantly increased. This requirement is implemented within German national legislation in the new version of the Radiation Protection Ordinance (StrlSchV), which now includes a new regulative area covering this aspect. As the possibilities of exercising control over sources of radiation of natural origin tire significantly limited compared to other radiation applications, the regulations affecting natural sources differ in certain respects. The regulations are limited here to those practices which may lead to radiation exposures to workers or members of the public in excess of 1 mSv. These regulations are directed primarily at the employer; and de fine the employer's responsibilities with respect to this area of health and occupational protection. Extensive licensing and monitoring procedures to be applied by the competent authorities are avoided in this respect.

The key component of the fuel channel is the pressure tube. It contains the fuel bundles and the pressurised heavy water (D2O) coolant. The operating conditions cause changes in the pressure tube dimensions due to irradiation creep and growth, changes in the mechanical strength and fracture toughness, and an increase in the equivalent hydrogen concentration resulting from corrosion of the pressure tube by the heavy water. The life management strategy for pressure tubes requires an inspection and evaluation programme for ageing mechanisms that could affect their fitness or service. The strategy includes: inspections for elongation, diametral expansion, and sag of the pressure tubes; volumetric inspection for flaws; and monitoring of the deuterium (D) concentration and mechanical properties. Central to the strategy are Fitness-for-Service Guidelines that ham been developed by the CANDU Owners Group that standardise the approach used to assess the potential for propagation of flaws detected during in-service inspections. The life management strategy ensures continued safe and reliable operation of current pressure tubes and will allow the pressure tubes in future reactors to reach their design life of at least 30 years.

Waste disposal can be categorised into one of two possible regimes: first, dilution and dispersal into the biosphere; or second, concentration, containment and isolation from the biosphere. Waste can be gaseous, liquid or solid and varies greatly as to the degree of chemical and physical hazard. In the case of radioactive waste, the radiotoxicity decays with time and there is chemical change, two of the parameters that illustrate that waste disposal is indeed a dynamic process.

The alloy fuel dispersant was produced by a centrifugal atomization process. The fuel shows stable in-reactor irradiation behavior to a fission density of 5 x 10(27) m(3) at an irradiation temperature of similar to 65 degreesC. The fuel-matrix interaction layer growth rate is similar to that observed in uranium-silicide fuels. The fuel particles have a fine and a relatively narrow fission gas bubble size distribution. There appears to be features in the microstrucure that are the result of segregation of the microstructure in to molybdenum rich and depleted regions on solidification. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The system is able to perform a real time monitoring of time-dependent biological phenomena. BETAview could be equipped either with GaAs or with Si semiconductor pixellated detectors. In this paper, we describe the results obtained with an assembly based on a Si detector, 300 pin thick, segmented into 64 x 64 170 mum size square pixels. The detector is bump-bonded to the low threshold, single particle counting chip named Medipix1, developed by a CERN-based European collaboration. The sensitive area is about 1 cm(2). Studies of background noise and detection efficiency have been performed. Moreover, time-resolved cellular uptake studies with radiolabelled molecules have been monitored. Specifically, we have followed in vivo and in real time, the [C-14]L-leucine amino acid uptake by eggs of Octopus vulgaris confirming the preliminary results of a previous paper. This opens the field of biomolecular kynetic studies with this new class of semiconductor DAR systems, whose evolution (using the Medipix2 chip, 256 x 256 pixels, 55 mum pixel size) is soon to come.

The experiment will be performed at the intense muon beam of PSI using a new experimental method allowing high precision measurements of the lifetime of muons stopped in ultra-pure deuterium-depleted hydrogen (protium). The basic element of the detector is a time projection chamber operating in hydrogen gas at 10 bar pressure, The arrival times and trajectories of the incoming muons and the outgoing decay electrons are measured with this device providing effective suppression of background. The system of chambers and electronics is designed for the large muon stop rates required for attaining high statistical accuracy. During four beam periods at PSI, data were taken. Also, various studies of the MWPC performance in hydrogen were made including ageing studies of the chambers under irradiation with stopped muons and with alpha and beta sources. It was demonstrated that the MWPCs can operate in pure hydrogen under 10 bar pressure with gas gains up to 5000, which is sufficient for the detection of relativistic electrons.

The excitation functions were compared with the published data. The optimum energy range for the production of Cu-61 and Cu-62 was found to be 39 --> 18 and 18.5 --> 6 MeV, respectively. The calculated thick target yield of Cu-61 in this energy range was 21.0 mCi/muA (supposing one half-life activation time)and 16.2 mCi/muA (supposing three half-life activation time) for Cu-62. The level of Cu-60 and Cu-62 impurities at Cu-64 production decreases to around 1% after a 1 h cooling time. The practical yield in this case is 17.2 mCi/muA. For production of Cu-62 the contamination level of Cu-64 increases continuously after EOB, but remains below 1% if the cooling time is less than 0.5 h (1.9 mCi/muA at 0.5 h after EOB). Unfortunately, in the case of Cu-60 production, the contamination level of Cu-64 and Cu-62 at EOB as found to be 18.4% and 47.9%, respectively. of the produced Cu-60 activity (6.4 mCi/muA, after 60 min irradiation time, in the energy interval 60 --> 44 MeV).

The implanted layer was Contaminated by C during the Nb implantation at 1173 K. The isothermal oxidation behavior of the above-treated alloys was investigated at 1173 K for 349.2 ks in air using a thermobalance. Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were employed to characterize the modified layer and oxide scale. The Al + Nb implanted alloy shows excellent long-term oxidation resistance due to the formation of a continuous and compact Al2O3 oxide scale. The co-existence of Nb and C in conjunction with the Al enrichment in the modified layer could inhibit the inward diffusion of O and prolong the beneficial effect of Nb and thus lead to the formation of the above protective scale. To the contrary, the oxidation rate of the Nb + Al implanted alloy remained very low in the first about 100 ks exposure and then accelerated. It is concluded that the C beneficial effect derived from the Nb and C layer formed during the 1173 K Nb implantation was weakened by the following Al implantation. The rapid consumption of Nb and fast inward diffusion of O finally contributed to the poor long-term oxidation resistance of the Nb + Al implanted alloy. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Kuehnel, K; Richter, KD; Drescher, G; Endrizzi, I				Kuehnel, K; Richter, KD; Drescher, G; Endrizzi, I			High local power densities permissible at Siemens pressurized water reactors	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						core monitoring; departure from nucleate boiling; core transient analysis		Operating nuclear fuel to higher discharge burnups reduces not only fuel cycle costs but also the volume of radioactive waste requiring disposal. In pressurized water reactors (PWRs), high local power densities are a prerequisite for achieving a high batch burnup. The range of maximum power densities that can be exploited for in-core fuel management and operational flexibility is restricted by the limiting conditions for operation obtained from analyses of anticipated operational occurrences and hypothetical accidents. Since utilities mainly use available margins for implementing advanced in-core fuel management strategies or for power uprating, a suitable parameter for making a rough comparison of the present thermal-hydraulic design status of different PWRs is the maximum local heat flux achieved during actual cycles under steady-state full-power conditions. A comparison between Siemens PWRs and the PWR designs of other vendors shows that the maximum local power densities during steady-state operation are usually higher in Siemens PWRs. The main reasons why higher power densities are permissible can usually be attributed to different core surveillance concepts (instrumentation and control) in conjunction with different control assembly management schemes. Moreover, two representative studies conducted with a new methodology using the three-dimensional neutronics/thermal-hydraulics coupled code PANBOX for core transient analysis present additional margins. Especially in plants using the Siemens core surveillance concept, the new methodology yields significant additional margins for PWRs to be operated with even higher permissible local power densities. The additional departure from nucleate boiling ratio (DNBR) margin gained in the representative studies was 0.38. However, utilization of this additional margin is accompanied by larger void fractions within the upper section of the hot channel during normal operation. Therefore, increasing steady-state maximum power densities has to be done gradually while collecting and evaluating operating experience each time. Depending on the specific circumstances at a plant, the gained margin can be utilized not only for more economical core loading patterns (improved low-leakage loading and/or elimination of burnable absorbers) or power uprating but also, in Siemens PWRs, to eliminate having to readjust the DNBR limitation circuit for one or more cycles. Although the concept presented here is specifically tailored to Siemens PWRs, it is obvious that the application of a three-dimensional neutronics/thermal-hydralilics coupled code could also provide significant benefits for non-Siemens PWRs as well.

J	Messaoudi, N; Tommasi, J				Messaoudi, N; Tommasi, J			Fast burner reactor devoted to minor actinide incineration	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						dedicated fast reactor; minoractinides; transmutation	TRANSMUTATION	This study proposes a new fast reactor core concept dedicated to plutonium and minor actinide burning by transmutation. This core has a large power level of similar to 1500 MW(electric) favoring the economic aspect. To promote plutonium and minor actinide burning as much as possible, total suppression of U-238, which produces Pu-239 by conversion, and large quantities of minor actinides in the core are desirable. Therefore, the U-238-free fuel is homogeneously mixed with a considerable quantity of minor actinides. From the safety point of view, both the Doppler effect and the coolant (sodium) void reactivity become less favorable in a U-238-free core. To preserve these two important safety parameters oil an acceptable level, a hydrogenated moderator separated from the fuel and nuclides, such as W or Tc-99, is added to the core in the place of U-238. Tungsten and Tc-99 have strong capture resonances at appropriate energies, and Tc-99 itself is a long-lived fission product to be transmuted with profit. This core allows the achievement of a consumption rate of similar to100 kg/TW(electric)(.)h of transuranic elements, similar to70kg/TW(eleetric)(.)h for plutonium(due to U-238 suppression), and 30 to 35 kg/TW(electric) (.) h for minor actinides. In addition, similar to 14 kg/TW(electric) (.) h of Tc-99 is destroyed when this element is present in the core (the initial loading of Tc-99 is >4000 kg in the core). The activity of newly designed subasseniblies has also been investigated in comparison to standard fast reactor subassemblies (neutron sources, decay heat, and gamma dose rate). Finally, a transmutation scenario involving pressurized water reactors and minor actinide-burning fast reactors has been studied to estimate the necessary proportion of burner reactors and the achievable radiotoxicity reduction with respect to a reference open cycle.

J	Loewen, EP; Weaver, KD; Hohorst, JK				Loewen, EP; Weaver, KD; Hohorst, JK			Reactivity, isotopic, and thermal steady-state analysis of homogeneous thoria-urania fuel	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						fuel performance; fuel cycle; thoda-urania		Recent investigations into the performance and economics of mixed thoria-urania fuel cycles demonstrate potential advantages at high burnup. Initial neutronic and fuel behavior calculations for several ThO2-UO2 mixtures being considered for use in commercial nuclear power plants are described. The Monte Carlo N-Particle-Origen2 Coupled Utility Program (MOCUP) was used to analyze the reactivity characteristics and isotopic concentrations Of unit fuel pins/cells and lattice/assembly models as a function of burnup and reactivity. Neutronic results for a three-batch 6-yr cycle for each of three proposed ThO2-UO2 mixtures with the UO2 enriched to 19.5% U-235 are presented. Neutronic results show that fuels fabricated from ThO2-UO2 MiXtUres can reach all average discharge burnup of lip to 70 MWd/kgHM, which will increase the time between refueling and decrease the production of weapons-grade plutonium by a factor of 3 as compared to all-urania fuel. A version of FRAPCON-3, modified to handle pure thoria and ThO2-UO2 mixtures, was used for the fuel performance and behavior calculations. The new version called FRAPCON-3Th includes the updated material property models for thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, emissivity, thermal expansion, modulus of elasticity, and melting temperature to predict fuel behavior for pure ThO2 or ThO2/UO2 mixed fuel. For a concentration of 75% ThO2/25% UO2, initial fuel performance parameters (peak centerline temperature, gap conductance, thermal expansion, etc.) predicted operating conditions are better than those of current UO2 fuel. A ThO2-ThO2/UO2 thermal conductivity model is still in the development stage. For all fuel calculations, an interim model that interpolates between the Belle and Berman predicted thermal conductivity using a correction factor for radiant heat transport and the MATPRO-predicted thermal conductivity for UO2 was applied.

The 16 samples from three kinds of pressurized water reactor (PWR) fuel rods and the 18 samples from two boiling water reactor (BWR) fuel rods were examined. Their initial U-235 enrichments and burnups were from 2.6 to 4.1 % and from 4 to 50 GWd/t, respectively. One PWR fuel rod and one BWR fuel rod contained gadolinia as a burnable poison. The measurements for more than 40 nuclides of uranium, transuranium, and fission product elements were performed by destructive analysis using mass spectrometry, and alpha-ray and gamma-ray spectrometry. Burnup for each sample was determined by the Nd-148 method. The analytical methods and the results as well as the related irradiation condition data are compiled as a complete benchmark data set.

Based on the assumption that the absorption of laser light follows the Lambert-Beer law, ablation parameters, such as absorption length and threshold fluence for ablation, of sintered Fe2O3 and stainless and carbon steels were measured in He, O-2, Kr, or SF6 atmospheres. The results indicated that SF6 was the most effective gas of all irradiation atmospheres studied for the exclusive removal of oxide layers formed on stainless and carbon steel samples in high-temperature pressurized water. Secondary ion mass spectroscopic measurement and scanning electron microscopic observation confirmed that no oxide layer existed on the steel samples after the exclusive removal with laser irradiation.

The degradation of the response of position-sensitive X-ray tomography detectors in the Joint European Torus (JET) tokamak is found after neutron exposure produced by deuterium-deuterium and deuterium-tritium plasma fusion experiments. For the purpose of further detailed characterization of the neutron degradation effects, an azimuthally varying-field (AVF) cyclotron accelerator is employed using well-calibrated neutron fluence. These neutron effects on the detector responses are characterized using synchrotron radiation from a 2.5 GeV positron storage ring at the Photon Factory (KEK). The effects of neutrons on X-ray sensitive semiconductor depletion thicknesses are also investigated using an impedance analyser. Novel findings of (i) the dependence of the response degradation on X-ray energies as well as (ii) the recovery of the degraded detector response due to the detector bias application are found and interpreted by systematically combined methods using a synchrotron facility, a cyclotron facility, a fusion plasma device, material analysis methods along with our recent theory on semiconductor X-ray responses.

This field is divided into two major areas; the use of X-rays for transmission imaging and the use of radioactive tracers in emission imaging (nuclear medicine). Until recently, most detector developments were for applications in nuclear medicine. However, in the past 5 years new developments in large area, X-ray-sensitive detectors have meant that both application domains are equally served. In X-ray imaging, work in CT and mammography are chosen as examples of sensor developments. Photodiode arrays in multi-slice spiral CT acquisitions are described and for mammography the use of amorphous silicon flat panel arrays is considered. The latter is an excellent example where new detector developments have required a re-think of traditional imaging methods. In gamma-ray imaging the recent developments in small area, task-specific cameras are described. Their limitations and current proposals to overcome those limitations are considered. PET has also received attention but recent clinical emphasis has been on the development of dual-headed gamma cameras which provides both SPECT and PET capability. Finally, some future requirements are considered. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A small laboratory prototype of a Compton camera is being constructed in order to initiate studies aimed at assessing the feasibility of Compton imaging of positron emitters. The design of the camera is based on the use of a silicon collimator consisting of a stack of double-sided, AC-coupled microstrip detectors (area 6 x 6 cm(2), 500 pin thickness, 128 channels/side). Two APV6 chips are employed for signal readout on opposite planes of each detector. This work presents the first results on the noise performance of the silicon strip detectors.

The technique of positron emission particle tracking (PEPT), developed at Birmingham, whereby a single tracer particle can be tracked at high speed, has proved particularly powerful. The main limitation of the original positron camera was its low sensitivity and correspondingly low data rate. A new positron camera has recently been installed: it consists of a pair of NaI (T1) gamma camera heads with fully digital readout and offers an enormous improvement in data rate and data quality. The performance of this camera, and in particular the improved capabilities it brings to the PEPT technique, are summarised. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Prototype sensors, produced by STMicroelectronics, have been extensively studied using laboratory measurements, a radioactive source and a beam of minimum ionising particles. The comparison with a standard 300 mum sensor shows that the collected charge in thick devices scales linearly with thickness. By over-depleting the irradiated devices, the pre-irradiated charge collection efficiency is fully recovered. The measured noise is in good agreement with expectations. Although more work is needed, the paper shows that 500 mum thick devices are a promising technology for very large tracking systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lee, BH; Koo, YH; Cheon, JS; Sohn, DS				Lee, BH; Koo, YH; Cheon, JS; Sohn, DS			Modeling of creep behavior of Zircaloy-4 by considering metallurgical effect	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								The creep model for Zircaloy-4 has been improved by including the metallurgical effect of Zircaloy cladding. Based on the experimental results in which the creep strain rate is highest for stress relief annealed cladding (SRA) and lowest for recrystallized cladding (RXA), the annealing factor was introduced and derived by iterative calculations until the best predictions for all the rods were obtained. The creep model has been incorporated into the KAERIs fuel performance code COSMOS and then verified with 4 cladding creep data, of which 3 cases exhibit creepdown and the other one creepout. The model predicts well the creep behavior of UO2 fuel rods in PWRs. The prediction does not show any discernable difference between the high- and low-Sn claddings. With satisfactory agreement between predicted and measured values, the comparison indicates no difference in creep behavior between MOX and UO2, fuel rods as expected. Although there are controversies over the experimental method and the analysis procedures for clad creepout, COSMOS generally well predicts the creep behavior, even in the case of creepout, if the creepout factor is applied.

The Commission made arrangements for the preparation and intercomparisons of the international standards of radium, which were identified as the Paris standard and the Vienna standard. Otto Honigschmid from Vienna prepared a first set of international secondary standards in 1912 and a second set in 1934. In both instances, these secondary standards were compared by gamma-ray measurements with the Paris and Vienna standards. The usage of these international standards of radium in the 20th century is described. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

For these methods, no calibration with known enrichment standards is required but accurate knowledge of nuclear data is needed. Despite this requirement, it appeared that during the exercise, four different sets of nuclear data were used by the participants. In view of this fact, it was decided to introduce these nuclear data sets into some computer codes in order to check their effects on the enrichment results. Two participants agreed to cooperate, and the main results of this test are presented here. It can be seen that three nuclear data sets, although different, give satisfactory results with no significant bias. Nevertheless, a more accurate characterization of X- and gamma-ray emission from U-235, U-238 and their daughters appears necessary. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In these systems, the signal digitization is performed immediately following the preamplification stage. This allows digital shaping and filtering of the signal which increases the number of possible combinations in signal shaping and as a consequence, optimizes the resolution as a function of the detector characteristics and the counting rate. Basic characteristic parameters of three digital signal processors that were recently introduced in the market have been studied and compared to those of an analog system. This study is carried out using a hyper-pure coaxial type germanium detector and Co-57, Co-60 and Cs-137 radioactive sources. Performance parameters such as energy resolution, system throughput, and counting losses that are due to dead time and pile-up effects are presented and discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Twelve laboratories, belonging to the National Environmental Radioactivity Surveillance Network, took part in the campaign. They are equipped with gamma-ray spectrometry systems based on p- and n-type HPGe detectors with different relative efficiencies. A simplified procedure was used for coincidence-summing correction. This procedure requires a single-photon, single-nuclide source to measure the peak-to-total efficiency ratio at just one photon energy value. All the laboratories were given a Cs-137 standard source for total efficiency determination, and a Cs-134 source in the same geometry whose activity they had to determine. The results show the usefulness of the procedure. The average deviation of all the laboratory results from the ENEA-INMRI reference value was reduced from -12% before correction to +1% after correction. The paper gives a description of the different organisational aspects of the campaign, reports the results obtained and draws conclusions in which the gain in measurement accuracy is evaluated in the light of the effort required for each participant to perform the correction.

The results of these measurements for many long-lived radionuclides, such as Co-60, Cs-137, Kr-85, Ba-133, Bi-207, Eu-152, Eu-154, and Eu-155, have been updated recently by the Radioactivity Group of NIST. These long-lived radionuclides are used extensively to calibrate: various nuclear counting and monitoring systems. The long-term precision of these calibrations can be greatly affected by the uncertainties in the calibrant half-lives. Results for the half-lives of many radionuclides measured over the last four decades are tabulated. In addition, values of the half-lives of several short-lived radionuclides used in nuclear medicine are addressed, which are critical in determining the correct dosage given in patient treatment, are addressed. Comparisons with the recommended values from the International Atomic Energy Agency Coordinated Research Program and the Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data File from Brookhaven National Laboratory are presented and any apparent disagreements noted.

These values were obtained from Ra-226 spectra in radioactive equilibrium with daughters such as Rn-222, Bi-214 and Pb-214 in the 50-2500 keV energy range. The efficiency calibration of the coaxial and planar Ge detectors took into account correction factors for pile-up losses, attenuation and source geometry effects, and gamma-gamma and gamma-X summation losses. XK emission probabilities were successfully resolved and determined more precisely because of the ability to de-convolute complex regions of the spectrum below 90 keV combined with spectral knowledge of the interferring Pb-XK-rays. The resulting absolute intensities of the main photon emissions of Ra-226 and daughters exhibit improvements (+/-0.7% for the smallest uncertainty estimated to one standard deviation) or agree with published data.

Knowing the half-life of K-40, the potassium-argon (K-Ar) method gives an estimate of the date of the rock's formation by measuring the quantity of the daughter stable isotope Ar-40. As in the case of other radiometric methods, the results of the K-Ar dating method are generally accompanied by an error estimate, which includes the counting process, the uncertainty in the half-life of K-40 and the beta to capture branching ratio. The objectives of this paper are basically three. First, we describe a procedure to incorporate the largest amount of the potassium cations into the liquid scintillator cocktail. This time, gels are able to provide much higher counting rates than the background. Second, Cerenkov counting gives the best shapefactor for K-40 beta-ray transitions. Third, the CIEMAT/NIST method determines the activity of the samples and an averaged half-life for the radionuclide. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

For the; construction of an efficiency curve vs. energy in a standard geometry, the accuracy is limited not only by the uncertainty of peak area determination and the knowledge of the relevant emission probabilities but also by the uncertainties of the activity values applied to efficiency calibration with standard sources. Recently, a method to determine a relative efficiency function using selected radionuclides with gamma cascades of well known emission probabilities has been developed which yields very accurate efficiency values. Such a curve has to be converted into an absolute efficiency curve by calibration of the detector system with at least one source of very well known activity. Especially for this purpose, a set of Co-60 gamma-ray spectrometer sources was produced at the PTB. The activity values (10-45 kBq) were measured by the 4pibeta-gamma coincidence technique with a standard uncertainty of less than 0.1%. Production and measurement of these sources are described in the present paper. Special care was taken to include all contributions to the standard uncertainty of the activity value when establishing the uncertainty budget for the activity of each of these sources. The activity ratio of two of these sources, as obtained by the absolute measurements, was checked by independent gamma-ray counting at two other laboratories, where the precision achieved was less than 0.2%. The procedure described is considered to be a step towards more accurately determined efficiency functions in gamma-ray spectrometry. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The prototype calorimeter consists of a cryostat with two temperature-controlled stages and a base stage that are operated at nominal temperatures of 8 K. A unique aspect of the calorimeter's design is the ability to repeatedly engage and disengage the radioactive source from the second stage heat path using a magnetically activated elevator. The measurement of the total power from a radioactive sample is obtained from the difference in the second stage power with and without the source in place.

In the DCC, the pulse amplitudes from both beta and gamma channels are digitized in commercial ADCs and the pulse input tunes are simultaneously determined by 10 MHz oscillation clock installed in the coincidence module. The activity of the measured source is determined from the information of pulse height and input time for each pulse by off-line analysis. The activity of Eu-152 was determined from extrapolations of efficiency functions obtained at 3gamma gates and the result showed a good agreement with that of the conventional method with 0.2% of uncertainty. The activity of Y-88 was also determined by the DCC technique, and the reliability of the result was proved through Asia Pacific Metrology Program (APMP) inter-comparison of Y-88.

Confirmatory measurements were carried out with gamma-ray spectrometry using high purity germanium detectors and a 4pigamma NaI(Tl) system. A calibration factor of 1.68 MBq pA(-1) +/- 0.03 MBq pA(-1) (expanded, k = 2, uncertainty) for the W-188 in the solution was determined, along with correction factors for activity determinations using Capintec dose calibrators. A half-life value of 69.78 d +/- 0.05 d (standard uncertainty) was determined by measurement in the NIST 4pigamma ionization chamber and is consistent with currently recommended values.

Initial ionization current measurements on the sources prior to destructive assays led to the establishment of calibration factors that can be used for subsequent non-destructive measurements of similar sources. Activity characterizations are needed to unequivocally relate theoretic absorbed-dose modeling results to dosimetric measurements, as well as to establish production and quality controls by the source manufacturers, and to satisfy the requirements of various governmental regulatory authorities.

The evaluation of measurement quality of the all participants indicated that over 90% of the intercomparison results complied with ANSI N42.22 and/or HPS N13.30 standards. Overall, the differences from the NIST values observed for all test nuclides and matrices are less than -7%, with a typical measurement precision better than 10% (1 s). The dependency of measurement quality on the test radionuclides, sample matrices, and radiochemical methods is identified by statistical analyses. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Hence, a systematic and careful procedure must be followed in the sampling and pre-treatment of the sample in order to ensure that the aliquot analysed represents the activity concentration of the entire sample. Statistical analyses of the activity concentrations of uranium and thorium isotopes in soil and sediment samples were performed to study the activity variation due to the lack of the representativity of the sample. These studies showed that, although some uncertainty in the determination of the sample activity concentration may be due to the lack of representativity (about 10%), the procedure followed for the pre-treatment of the sample can be considered adequate, providing an acceptable level of representativity.

Radioactive sources were also sent to the International Reference System (SIR) at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) in order to link the results of these regional comparisons to the BIPM key comparison-reference values. The arithmetic mean for the activity results of Ho-166m was in good agreement with the SIR reference value, but some disagreements were found for Co-58 and Y-88 results. The mean values for Co-58 and Y-88 were both higher than the existing SIR values by about 1.5% and 0.9%, respectively. Although there were some disagreements, it was successfully demonstrated that these regional comparisons could be linked to other international key comparisons through the SIR. The present results were also evaluated to estimate a reasonable uncertainty level for each laboratory, which is very important in the establishment of an adequate traceability scheme for radioactivity standards.
