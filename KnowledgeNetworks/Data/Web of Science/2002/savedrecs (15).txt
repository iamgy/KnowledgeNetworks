A sample sheet was exposed to a deuterium plasma and deuterium permeation through it was monitored. The plasma-facing side was bombarded with He-3 ions and deuterium depth profiles were observed by a nuclear reaction analysis under the plasma exposure. The result showed that traps, probably vacancies associated with radiation damages, were produced by the ion bombardment. From consideration of an equilibrium between trapped and dissolved deuterium, the equilibrium constant was estimated from the experimental data and the trapping energy of 1.1 eV was obtained. The production rate of the traps was found to be 0.007 from evolution of the concentration of trapped deuterium with the number of atomic displacements.

The surface density of deuterium estimated from the peak area was saturated with longer time and hardly decreased after the exposure. This was explained by that the incident deuterium atoms from the plasma were absorbed on deuterium-free sites and absorbed atoms were not desorbed. The deuterium concentration in the bulk increased nearly in proportion to the square root of time and gradually decreased after the plasma exposure. This was explained by a simple diffusion model and an apparent diffusion coefficient was found to be 2x10(-18) m(2)s(-1) from the depth profile.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of boron layer made by He+B10D14 method with 43 nm in thickness showed that the B/(B+C) ratio was about 0.9. Hydrogen isotopes in the boron layer and in the carbon layer were released at above 573 K and 1023 K, respectively. This means that hydrogen isotopes in the boron layer on the carbon tiles in JT-60U are released at temperatures as low as 573 K. The He+B10D14 boronization method is clearly effective to attain the high purity deuterium plasma and the low recycling because this method does not introduce H during boronization process. Wall conditioning before boronization is important because hydrogen retained in the carbon is released during plasma discharge through boron coating.

It was found that both distributions were quite different, i.e. deuterium retention was higher at the deposited area, whereas tritium retention was higher at the erosion dominated area. This is because tritium produced by the D-D reaction, initially having 1 MeV, did not fully lose its energy in the TEXTOR plasma and implanted into the plasma facing materials nearly homogeneously, whereas deuterium was codeposited with carbon and boron, the main impurities in the TEXTOR plasma. This is also confirmed by the finding that high level of tritium was detected beneath the deposited layer. Tritium distribution, however, was modified by the temperature increase due to plasma heat load. Thus the comparison of tritium profiles with the deuterium profile gives a large amount of important and new information on PMI, and may be used as a new diagnostic technique for PMI.

As a result, tritium transport investigation becomes technologically more feasible because a cost-effective radioactive device is not mandatory. Additionally, a precise isotopic description allows differentiating the behaviour of the fuel-components deuterium and tritium within the blanket structures in reactor operation conditions. A time-dependent gas-phase isovolumetric desorption technique has been used to evaluate the isotopic effects in the diffusive transport parameters of hydrogen in an 8% CrWVTa reduced activation martensitic steel in the temperatures range 423 to 892 K and driving pressures from 4.10(4) to 1.10(5) Pa. Experiments have been run with both protium and deuterium obtaining their respective transport parameters diffusivity (D), Sieverts' constant (K-s), permeability (Phi), the trap site density (eta(t)) and the trapping activation energy (E-t).

The specimens were 8 kinds of commercially available silica glass. T was injected by the Li-6 (n,alpha)T reaction of sintered pellets of lithium oxide (Li2O) into the silica glass with thermal neutrons in JRR-2 (VT-8) up to 5 x 10(18) neutrons/cm(2) at ambient temperature (about 350 K). After irradiation, the Li2O pellets were removed from the silica glass, and T release from the silica glass was measured in a flow of hydrogen (H-2) or ammonia (NH3) sweep gas at atmospheric pressure at a constant heating rate of 2 K/min between 675 K and 1375 K with a proportional counter. In the case of H-2 sweep gas, a maximum tritium release rate was observed around 1023 K, while in the case of NH3 Sweep gas, two peaks around 1023 K and around 1123 K or a peak around 1123 K with a shoulder were obserbed. After the experiments of T release, FT-IR spectra showed a decrease of SiOH bands at 3650 cm(-1). On the other hand, no changes in intensities at 2250 cm(-1) due to SiH were observed for both samples before and after T release.

The evaluations were performed under detail design of the blankets with nuclear and thermal analyses, F82H was selected as the structural material and the temperature of cooling tubes in the tritium breeder zone was evaluated between 673K and 783K. In this temperature range, tritium permeation rate through the cooling tubes in tritium breeder zone was evaluated and also tritium permeation into the first wall cooling water by the implantation of tritium particle was evaluated. In addition, requirements for preventing tritium permeation into the cooling water have been examined.

The diffusivity of deuterium for both molybdenum and tungsten decreased with an addition of C and B. This decrease was considered due to the trap effect of carbide and boride. The trapping energy estimated was 54 kJ/mol for Mo-C and Mo-B and 82kJ/mol for W-C.

While the permeation of hydrogen isotopes through palladium/silver membranes combined with heterogeneously catalyzed reactions were proven to be particularly suitable for highly contaminated gases, isotopic swamping in a counter current mode is the method of choice in ITER for the final detritiation and recovery of residual amounts of tritium. Since the catalyst employed to promote the isotope exchange reactions should not support methanation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide an attempt was made to design a highly selective exchange catalyst. Amongst the catalysts screened with methane - deuterium exchange and carbon oxide - methanation as test reactions a high temperature reduced palladium/silica (SiO2) catalyst was found to match the selectivity requirements. However, even though the palladium/silica catalyst shows very little activity for methanation, carbon monoxide was found to obstruct the isotope exchange reaction, whereas carbon dioxide does not show this unwanted effect.

Thus, over the years a number of gas detritiation systems have been developed. Recently there has been interest in lower-cost, simpler systems which do not convert HT to the much more hazardous HTO form. Examples of such systems are 1) a bubbler/dehumidifier, 2) a bubbler/collector, and 3) an adsorber/collector. A computer model of each configuration was written and run. Each system's performance, including tritium buildup in liquid water, and tritium exhausted to the environment, are presented and compared.

We have proposed a new closed loop FCU system built up by connecting the tubular reservoir tank, the electrolytic reactor and a palladium diffuser. In the electrolytic reactor, methane and water are converted at the same time by electrochemical reaction in gas phase oxidation and reduction to liberate hydrogen isotope as a form of elemental hydrogen. The long tubular reservoir tank that is designed to store and transfer the products gas in plug flow prevents from mixing with reactants for the successive repeat processing. With this tank, high overall decontamination factor of system can be obtained by small number of circulation. As the demonstration test, mixture gas consist of hydrogen isotopes, methane and He were processed in the closed loop FCU.

At the experiment site, the system enables us to purify the D-T target gas by removing He-3 component, to adjust the D/T gas mixing ratio and to measure the hydrogen isotope components. The system is specially designed to handle the D-T gas with a negative pressure, and the maximum tritium inventory of 56 TBq (1500 Ci) is operated. The employed combination of a palladium filter and a cryotrap has demonstrated as an efficient device to purify hydrogen gas with a negative pressure. We have completed a series of muon catalyzed d-t fusion experiments at various tritium concentrations, including an experiment with a non-equilibrium D-2-T-2 target condition. The muon catalyzed t-t fusion process has also been studied using the tritium gas supplied free of He-3 by the system.

Baseline test conditions were five percent methane in helium at ten sccm, 101 kPa (760 torr), and 700degreesC. Changes from baseline conditions varied temperature, pressure, flow rate, and carrier gas composition to include hydrogen and nitrogen. Methane cracking efficiency (epsilon(M)) decreased with decreasing temperature and pressure. Faster gas feed rates decreased epsilon(M), but cracked more methane. Introducing hydrogen, nitrogen, or ammonia into the feed gas reduced epsilon(M), but ammonia was still cracked at high efficiencies. epsilon(M) was further decreased when both nitrogen and hydrogen were in the carrier gas compared to using a carrier of only nitrogen or hydrogen.

Tritium production in the orthosilicate will inevitably also produce some tritiated water which should be removed from the helium purge gas stream before the extraction of tritium (mainly HT) by passing it through a liquid nitrogen cooled molecular sieve bed. To minimise the amount of adsorbed water in the molecular sieve beds a cryogenic cold trap (CT) will be included in the tritium extraction system (TES). The expected water concentration in this gas stream is of the order of 10 ppm by volume. A cold trap in a technical scale (1/6 of the ITER operating conditions) with design features meeting the requirements for water vapour trapping, i.e. variable cool-down rates and low velocity of the working gas, was used to investigate the water removal efficiency. In this paper we describe the first results obtained with small He throughputs as well as recent results obtained for medium and high He flow rates containing water vapour ranging from 10 to 16 ppm(v).

System designs for Tokamak Exhaust Processing (TEP), Storage and Delivery (SDS), Isotope Separation (ISS) and Tritium, plant Analytical Systems (ANS) have been generated, with emphasis placed on measures to minimise tritium inventory. Design integration studies and dynamic simulations of tritium inventory behaviour have been performed. Recent TEP R&D has focussed on upgrading of the test loop for integrated testing of gas streams representative of all modes of operation, including tritium recovery from Plasma Facing Components (PFC s). Tests to characterise tritium inventories in PFC s and develop processes for quantitative recovery of this tritium are under way. A near ITER scale Torus Exhaust cryopump has been tested and the pumping speed design calculations validated. Tests to ensure that ISS product quality can be maintained during fluctuations in feed conditions have been successfully carried out. Construction of an ITER-scale tritium storage bed is in progress.

Tritium release behavior was measured using an ionization chamber connected to the release tritium measurement apparatus. The sample was purged by dry N-2, N-2 with hydrogen of various partial pressure, or humidified N-2 gas. The temperature of the sample bed was changed linearly from room temperature to 1073K with the rising rate of 5K/min.

The alloy contains beta-phase, i.e., intermetallic compound beta-LiAl, which has a large influence on the tritium behavior in Li-6-AI alloy. Since beta-LiAl has a unique crystal structure and a large amount of Li vacancy at room temperature, the tritium behavior in beta-LiAl is affected by the defect structure and the lithium diffusion. In this paper, on the basis of a simultaneous measurement of tritium release rate and electrical reseistivity, it is suggested that the tritium diffusion has a strong correlation with the lithium diffusion in the neutron-irradiated beta-(LiAl)-Li-6.

Pellets of enriched Li2TiO3 with a diameter of 12 mm and a thickness of 2 mm were used as detectors inside the tritium breeding layer. After irradiation, the pellets were dissolved and the tritium activity in the sample solution was measured by liquid scintillation counting.

J	Nakashima, N; Beloglazov, S; Hashimoto, K; Nishikawa, M				Nakashima, N; Beloglazov, S; Hashimoto, K; Nishikawa, M			Isotope exchange reaction between gaseous hydrogen and tritium on Li2TiO3 grain surface	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	NOV 12-16, 2001	TSUKUBA, JAPAN				ADSORPTION CHARACTERISTICS; WATER-VAPOR; PURGE GAS; LI2O BED; INVENTORY; LI2ZRO3; BLANKET	Though litium ceramic materials such as Li2O, LiAlO2, Li2ZrO3, Li4SiO4, and Li2TiO3. are considered as the candidates for breeding materials in the blanket of a D-T fusion reactor, the release behavior of the bred tritium in these solid breeder materials has not been fully understood yet. We have pointed out that it is essential to understand such mass transfer steps as diffusion of tritium in the grain, absorption of water in the bulk of grain, and adsorption of water on the surface of grain, together with two types of isotope exchange reactions for estimation of the tritium inventory in a uniform solid breeder blanket under the steady-state condition. The rate of isotope exchange reaction-1 on Li2TiO3 is quantified in this study, where pebbles of Li2TiO3 from CEA, KHI, and NFI are used. It is observed in this study that the rate of isotope exchange reaction on Li2TiO3 becomes 2similar to3 order smaller than other solid breeder materials when it is placed in the hydrogen atmosphere at high temperature. It is also observed that the color of Li2TiO3 changed to black in accordance with decrease of reaction rate. The observation obtained at the release experiment of bred tritium performed in Kyoto University Reactor that chemical form of tritium becomes HTO at the high temperature even when hydrogen of 100 Pa is added to the purge gas can be explained by decrease of isotope exchange reaction rate. Tritium inventory in the Li2TiO3 blanket in various conditions are also discussed in this paper.

(MAPI). The release curves were obtained by temperature programmed desorption (TPD) techniques in a series of experiments in Kyoto University Reactor (KUR) and in the JRR-4 reactor of the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI). In the model a number of mass transfer steps were taken into account. There were diffusion of tritium in the grain, adsorption and desorption of water on the surface of grains, two types of isotope exchange reactions, water formation reaction in addition of hydrogen to the purge gas. Tritium release curves for different purge gas compositions (N-2, N-2 + H2O) were calculated to compare with data obtained in the experiments. Apparent diffusivities of tritium in crystal grain of Li2ZrO3 were determined.

The recovery methods are a permeation window, a Flibe-He counter-current-extraction tower and a rotational centrifugal flow system. There is high possibility in that the rate-determining step of the permeation window is tritium diffusion in Flibe. The tritium diffusion in liquid Flibe drops is also the dominant process in the counter-current-extraction tower. The determination of the tritium diffusion rate in purified or unpurified Flibe (or actual blanket environment) is a key to estimate the tritium recovery rate accurately.

Most commercial catalysts widely used for oxidation are fabricated using alumina substrates. However, in terms of the adsorption for tritiated water vapors, zeolites could have better performance. Thus, the authors conducted test fabrication of noble metal catalysts of which substrates are A-type zeolites and examined their catalytic performance for the oxidation of hydrogen and methane. The results indicate that these newly developed catalysts have excellent catalytic activity for the oxidation of hydrogen and their performance exceeds or is comparable to that of commercial Pd/alumina catalysts. Furthermore, it was also found that these catalysts have lower catalytic activity for the oxidation of methane compared with the commercial Pd/alumina catalysts. This result reveals a possibility that these catalysts can be utilized for the selective oxidation of molecular tritium and tritiated methane, which could be useful for monitoring of environmental tritium.

However, the isotope exchange reaction proceeds fast only at the more elevated temperatures, so that the rate of isotope exchange reactions is considerably low at lower temperatures. Taking into consideration that there is a broad temperature distribution within a blanket module, it is anticipated that the tritium bred in regions of lower temperatures will be poorly recovered. For this reason, there is still a need to develop techniques that contribute to the acceleration of the recovery of bred tritium at lower temperatures. In our previous works, the effect of catalytic active metal additives, such as Pt and Pd, on the heterogeneous isotope exchange reactions at the breeder-sweep gas interface was examined. The results indicate that the exchange reactions were considerably enhanced with the help of catalytic metals. In this work, the authors first examined the effect of the amounts of deposited catalytic active metal additives, such as Pt and Pd, on the heterogeneous isotope exchange reactions at the breeder-sweep gas interface. The results of this works indicate that the exchange reaction on the surface of Li4SiO4 is enhanced even if the amount of deposited Pd is as low as 0.015 %. It was also found that the deposition of 0.15 wt % of Pt enhances the exchange reaction rate, The authors also examined the effect of non-noble metal additive. such as Ni, on the heterogeneous isotope exchange reactions at the breeder-sweep gas interface. The results indicate that the exchange reactions were considerably enhanced with the help of Ni. Thus, it was found that Ni is also effective for the enhancement of the exchange reaction rate.

The main functions of this system are described below. 1) Transport of tritium with helium, purge gas: tritium released from ceramic breeding material in the blanket is transported to the tritium. recovery system by the helium purge gas which contains a small amount of hydrogen gas. 2) Steam electrolysis and removal of oxygen gas: the oxygen pump with electrolyte of oxygen ionic conductors electrolyzes the stem (H2O and HTO) contained in the purge gas into hydrogen isotopes and oxygen, and simultaneously removes impurity of oxygen by electrical membrane permeation. 3) Recovery of hydrogen isotopes: the hydrogen pump with electrolyte of protonic conductors electrically recovers the pure hydrogen isotopes (HT and H-2) from the purge gas. Based on the experimental data obtained by feasibility study and the present design effort, it was revealed that the simple and continuous tritium recovery system for gaseous stem is possible and attractive for fusion power reactors.

In this demonstration facility, a liquid-phase catalytic exchange (LPCE) column, using AECL's wetproofed catalyst, separated tritium from deuterium and a specially designed, low-inventory electrolytic cell provided tritium-enriched deuterium to the LPCE column. An overhead recombiner, also using wetproofed catalyst, produced detritiated heavy water. Tritium was removed from the electrolysis cell as tritiated deuterium gas and packaged as a titanium deuteride. The design detritiation factor of 100 was readily achieved using a 370 GBq/kg heavy water feed. Design features, operational experience and results from the 4-month, 2000-h operation are described.

The catalysts under comparison are from Russia, Belgium and Romania. The intercomparison is being performed by computing the height equivalent of theoretical plates (HETP) and the mass transfer coefficients for HD transfer from gas to water using the measured values of the composition. The range of HD concentration in hydrogen as carrier gas was 1000 ppm up to 2%. The gas and liquid composition at the bottom and at the top of the column and the condensed vapour composition at the top of the column are measured by mass spectrometry and IR spectrometry.

A new process invented at the Savannah River Site, has been developed at Valduc facility: Thermal Cycling Absorption Process. This system uses palladium packed in a column to absorb a stream of hydrogen isotopes. By repeated heating and cooling cycles, the hydrogen isotopes successively desorb into a capacity and go back onto the column. The thermal cycling creates differences in the Pd separation factor for the hydrogen isotopes inducing the concentration of tritium at one end of the column and the concentration of the lighter isotopes at the other end. This paper presents experimental results obtained with a full-scale facility which has been installed in a glovebox so as to treat weakly tritiated gases. Experimental data collected on this device working with several isotopic mixtures are presented and compared to simulation results.

Height of Transfer Unit (HTU), Height Equivalent to Theoretical Plate (HETP) and overall mass transfer coefficient (K-G) were evaluated for tritium and deuterium isotopic exchange between gaseous hydrogen and liquid water using the LPCE column operated with the same three-isotope mixture. The HTU and K-G were the same for tritium and deuterium. This indicates that mass transfer in gaseous phase and isotopic exchange reaction limit the overall mass transfer rate in the LPCE column. However, a deviation from this behaviour has been observed for the small water load to the column.

The results show that displacement efficiency of deuterium decreases as displacement time decreases. Compared with the effects at low flow rate, high displacement efficiency still can be attained at high flow rate because higher displacement pressure that increases the collision frequency partly compensates the loss of exchange caused by an increase in flow rate.

Simultaneously an original and efficient dynamic simulation tool has been developed in collaboration with PROSIM Company. After a brief description of the TCAP process device developed and the establishment of the modelling approach adopted, a deeper understanding of the complex TCAP behavior is lighted on through some simulation results. Then, a sensitivity analysis of the TCAP operating parameters on its global performance and particularly on the tritium contamination in the head flow is presented. Finally, all these results are applied to propose an optimized operating sequence for the recovery of tritium from low concentrated hydrogen mixtures.

The concept of the Combined Electrolysis Catalytic Exchange (CECE) process was selected for the WDS. The design conditions are (a) tritium concentration of waste water: 3.7x10(10)similar to3.7x10(11) Bq/kg, (b) waste water flow rate: 20 kg/h (1100 mol/h), a net working rate: 300 days, annual capacity: 150 tons/year (c) tritium concentration in the H-2 discharged to environment: 6.5x10(1) Bq/m(3), (d) tritium concentration in the H2O vapor discharged to environment: 3.7x10(3) Bq/m(3), (e) tritium concentration in the electrolyzer: similar to1.85x10(13) Bq/kg. Tritium concentration in the electrolyzer is determined considering the lifetime of the electrolyzer which depends on tritium concentration. Design value of height of a unit (30cm) of water-hydrogen isotopic exchange column and the correlation between the column internal flow rates and the column diameter were determined based on similar system for Japanese advanced thermal reactor (Fugen) moderated with heavy water.

However, there are safety and cost considerations associated with the considerable tritium inventory that can accumulate in such an isotope separation system (ISS). The ISS must be able to reliably produce specified products while responding to varying input streams. To design an ISS that balances all of these considerations and operate it reliably, it is essential to have a computer model of the system. This allows for a better understanding of the system and the exploration of various parameter regions that would otherwise require very expensive experimentation. The value of such a model, however, is questionable until it is validated by comparison with actual experiments Recently, as part of the Annex IV US/Japan collaboration, a series of tests were conducted on the ISS system at the Tritium Systems Test Assembly (TSTA) located at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). This system has a fusion power plant-relevant capacity of 6 SLPM (standard liters per minute). These experiments employed light hydrogen (protium), deuterium and tritium. Conditions at five steady state conditions were measured. The measurements included concentration measurements at the column feed, top and bottom, and also at intermediate points. These measurements served as a benchmark for comparison to DYNSIM, the model that has been in use at LANL for many years(dagger) This model was able to accurately predict the column concentration profile based on the measured pressure, temperature, reboiler heat, feed composition and flows for a set of significantly different operating conditions. These results impart confidence that the model is useful for future ISS design and for better understanding of existing system operations.

Performance requirements for process equipment were evaluated and some minor refinements were made to selected components. In particular, the recombination efficiency of tritium in the electrolytic oxygen stream was improved and the tritiated-water feed point was moved to a location lower in the catalyst column. With these modifications, the facility was able to remove more than 99.998% of the tritium (i.e., achieve a DF greater than 50 000) from a heavy water feed stream containing 330 GBq/kg, with 7.8 TBq/kg in the electrolysis cell.

One kind of the column was the mixture of Pd-Pt alloy and Cu powders as the previous study. But special attention was paid for preparing the separation column; Pd-Pt alloy particles below 200 mesh was mixed with copper powder of 150-200 mesh and packed into a loading tube of stainless steel as uniform as possible. The separation for H-D mixture gases could be remarkably improved by this column even at temperatures around 300 K. This column also could separate tritium as T, from H-D-T mixture gas containing only 0.13% T. The other column was prepared by Pd-Pt alloy supported by porous SiC powder for economical use of the expensive alloy. Although this column gave similar separation chromatograms, the separation efficiency was still insufficient and further studies are required.

After successful commissioning tests the column was connected to the existing gas chromatographic Isotope Separation System within a glove box. It was demonstrated that equipment which has already been operated with large amounts of tritium can be opened without spreading excessive contamination if proper purging has been carried out before the breach of the primary system. Commissioning with deuterium and small amounts of tritium after the new column was integrated into the existing process circuit in the glove box confirmed the good separation of the new column already demonstrated before.

This paper presents bipolar electrolysis, an electrochemical process that can be used for isotopic enrichment of tritiated water. After having described the principle of the process and its application to isotopic separation, we simulate the working of an operational cell considering both weakly (500 Ci/L, 1.85.10(13)Bq/L) and highly active (100,000 Ci/L, 3.70.10(15) Bq/L) tritiated water. In both cases the treatment leads to negligible gaseous tritium reject.

J	Beck, HL; Bennettt, BG				Beck, HL; Bennettt, BG			Historical overview of atmospheric nuclear weapons testing and estimates of fallout in the continental United States	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	37th Annual Meeting of the National-Council-on-Radiation-Protection-and-Measurements	APR 04-05, 2001	ARLINGTON, VA	Natl Council Radiat Protect & Measurements		fallout; nuclear weapons; atmospheric testing; National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements		From 1945 to 1980, over 500 weapons tests were conducted in the atmosphere at a number of locations around the world. These tests resulted in the release of substantial quantities of radioactive debris to the environment. Local, intermediate, and global fallout deposition densities downwind from test sites depended on the heights of bursts, the yields, and the half-lives and volatilities of the particular fission or activation products, as well as on the meteorological conditions. A number of national and international monitoring programs were established to trace the fallout through the atmosphere and biosphere. These programs included continuous monitoring of ground-level air, exposure rates, and deposition as well as periodic sampling of food, bone, water, soil, and stratospheric air. Although data for specific high-yield tests are still classified, the fission and fusion yields of the various tests and test series have been estimated and from this information the quantities of specific fission and activation products released into the atmosphere have been determined. The geographic and temporal variations in the fallout deposition of specific radionuclides based on both actual measurements and model calculations are discussed in this paper. A feasibility study to estimate the deposition density (deposition per unit area) of particular radionuclides from both Nevada Test Site and "global" fallout on a county-by-county scale for the continental United States is described. These deposition estimates provide a basis for reconstructing population exposure and dose. They support the feasibility of a more detailed evaluation of the population doses that resulted from fallout from atmospheric tests to document the experience fully and to report results more systematically and completely to the world community. The impact of weapons fallout will continue to be felt for years to come since a contaminant baseline has been imposed on the ambient radiation environment that will be an important factor in the assessment of past and future releases of radioactive materials into the biosphere.
