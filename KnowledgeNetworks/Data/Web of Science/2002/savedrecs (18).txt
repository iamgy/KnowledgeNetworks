The model is based on autopsy and urinalysis data, specifically the plutonium distribution between the respiratory tract and the remainder of the body, taken from 543 former workers of a radiochemical facility at the Mayak Production Association (MPA) plant. The metabolism of plutonium was represented with a compartmental model, which considers individual exposure histories and the inherent solubility properties of industrial plutonium aerosols. The transport properties of plutonium-containing aerosols were estimated by experimentally defining their in vitro solubility. The in vitro solubilities were found by dialysis in a Ringer's solution. Analysis of the autopsy data indicated that a considerable fraction of the inhaled plutonium is systemically redistributed rapidly after inhalation. After the initial dynamic period, a three-compartment model describes the retention in the respiratory tract. One compartment describes the nuclide retained in the lungs, the second compartment describes a plutonium lung concentration that exponentially decreases with time, and the third compartment describes the concentration in the pulmonary lymph nodes. The model parameters were estimated by minimizing sum squared of the error between the tissue and bioassay data and the model results. The parameters reflect the inverse relationship between plutonium retention in lungs and the experimentally derived aerosol transportability. The model was validated by comparing the autopsy results with in vivo data for 347 cases. The validation indicates that the model parameters are unbiased. This model is being used to estimate individual levels of nuclide accumulation and to compute radiation doses based upon the urinary excretion rates.

The data were obtained by radiochemical analysis of soft tissues and bones samples collected upon autopsy of 120 workers who died from acute coronary diseases and accidents. The soft tissue samples were wet-ashed using nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. Bone samples were ashed in a muffle furnace at 500degreesC. Plutonium was extracted on anionite and coprecipitated with bismuth phosphate. The precipitation was blended with ZnS powder, and the alpha-activity was measured by ZnS solid scintillation counting in a low-background alpha radiometer. Twenty-five years after the beginning of inhalation exposures, the average percentage of plutonium in the skeleton and liver was 50% and 42% of systemic burden, respectively. A multivariate regression was used to quantify the effects of exposure time, "transportability" of the various compounds, plutonium body content, and age on systemic plutonium distribution. The early retention of plutonium in the liver is assumed to be greater than that in the skeleton. The initial distribution of plutonium between the liver and the skeleton, immediately after entering the circulatory system, was 50:38%, respectively. With time, the fraction of plutonium found in the liver decreased, while the fraction in the skeleton increased at a rate of 0.5% y(-1) of systemic deposition. Exposure time had a greater effect on the relative retention of plutonium in the main organs when compared to age. The statistical estimates that characterized the relative plutonium distribution were less stable for the liver than for the skeleton, likely due to the slower turnover of skeletal tissues and the retention of plutonium in bone.

The doses have been employed in numerous dose response studies measuring both stochastic and deterministic effects. This article documents both the historical (pre-1999) and current ("Doses 1999") methods used by the FIB-1 scientists to determine the doses. Both methods are based on a three-chamber lung model developed by the FIB-1 scientists. This method was developed in partial isolation from the West and has unique characteristics from the more familiar ICRP biokinetic models. Some of these characteristics are the use of empirically based transportability classifications and the parameter modification for chelation-therapy-enhanced excretion data. An example dose calculation is provided and compared to the dose that would be obtained if the ICRP models were used. The comparison demonstrates that the models are not interchangeable and produce different results.

Potential exposure to uranium amongst employees of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement in western Kosovo was assessed. Methods: Individuals (n = 31) who had resided at least 3 mo in western Kosovo provided 24-h urine collections and completed an administered questionnaire. Specimens were analyzed for creatinine concentration, and uranium concentration was determined using inductively coupled mass spectrometry. Findings: Subjects ranged in age from 22 to 45 y, and 77% were male. Mean duration of residency was 11 mo, and 14 individuals were in western Kosovo throughout the hostilities. Almost three quarters of subjects reported seeing destroyed tanks or vehicles, predominantly while passing by within a vehicle. Two individuals spent time within 50 in of a destroyed tank or vehicle while outside of a vehicle. Urinary uranium concentrations ranged from 3.5 to 26.9 ng of uranium per liter of urine (median 8.9 ng L-1). Creatinine normalized values ranged from 2.9 to 21.1 ng of uranium per gram of creatinine (median 7.4 ng g(-1) creatinine). These results fall toward the lower end of urinary uranium determinations made amongst non-exposed populations drawn from a literature review. Interpretation: These results do not indicate an increased exposure to uranium amongst adults living and working in western Kosovo who do not spend time in proximity to destroyed vehicles. Environmental sampling and replication of these results amongst a sample including children and individuals reporting intensive exposure to destroyed vehicles would further develop the exposure assessment.

J	Mao, YH; Liu, YG; Zhang, G; Hu, XL				Mao, YH; Liu, YG; Zhang, G; Hu, XL			The studies on radiological limits of color-glazed tiles used in home decoration	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						Ra-226; Rn-222; exhalation rate; safety standards		This study was carried out to lay down the radiological limits of color-glazed tiles used in home decoration. The activity concentrations of various end products and raw materials as well as processed materials were measured using gamma spectroscopy. Rn-222 exhalation rates from the surface of color-glazed tiles were measured using charcoal canister method. Levels of exposure to alpha ray and beta ray from the surface of glazed tiles were measured by surface alpha and beta contaminant instrument. The results show a great difference between the radioactive levels of the surface glaze and the matrix of color-glazed tiles. The Rn-222 exhalation rates from the surface of color-glazed tiles are in the range of 10(-3)-10(-4) Bq m(-2) s(-1). The concentrations of some natural radionuclides in glaze exceed the exempt limits of International Basic Safety Standards for Protection against Ionizing Radiation Sources (IAEA 1997). The limits for color-glazed tiles were deduced according to these data and the theory of UNSCEAR (1993). The activity concentration of Ra-226 (Bq kg(-1)) in the glaze of color-glazed tiles should be in the range of A(Ra-226) less than or equal to 1,000 (Bq kg(-1)), and, at the same time, the specific activity of the natural radionuclides (Bq kg(-1)) should be in the range of A(Th-232)/230 + A(Ra-226)/310 + A(K-40)/3,500 less than or equal to 1.

Monitoring of the first contamination began on day 34 and that of the second one within 1 h after inhalation. According to the two-exponential models long-term biological half-times of 92 and 93 d were obtained for the first and second contaminations, respectively. The short-term biological half-time for the second contamination was calculated as 3.0 d. The mean value of the fraction of Cs-137 excreted in daily urine to that in total excreta was 0.88 for the first contamination and 0.89 for the second one.

The reprocessing plant is due to be completed by 2004. We surveyed indoor and outdoor environmental gamma-ray dose rates throughout Aomori Prefecture from 1992 to 1996 to get background data before operation of the plant. Glass dosimeters were used to measure cumulative gamma-ray dose rate. The outdoor gamma-ray dose rates were measured at 109 locations in the prefecture. The indoor gamma-ray dose rates were measured at 81 locations, which were generally in a dwelling near the location of an outdoor measurement. The contribution of radionuclides in the ground to the outdoor dose rate was estimated by using in-situ gamma-ray spectrometry with a germanium detector. The spectra were measured, at 20 locations used for the glass dosimeter measurements. The outdoor gamma-ray dose rate was higher in the Tsugaru area (western part of the prefecture) than in the Nanbu area (eastern part). Means of the dose rate were 28, 31, and 25 nGy h(-1) for the whole prefecture and Tsugaru and Nanbu areas, respectively. The dose rates in winter were lower than those in the other seasons due to the shielding effect of snow on the ground. Mean contributions of uranium series, thorium series and K-40 to the dose rates were 7.7, 8.2, and 9.3 nGy h(-1), respectively. The indoor dose rate was generally higher than the outdoor one, and the mean ratio of indoor to outdoor dose rates was 1.42. Means of indoor gamma-ray dose rate were 41, 37, and 43 nGy h(-1) for the whole prefecture and Tsugaru and Nanbu areas, respectively. The average effective dose rate to people in the prefecture was estimated to be 0.24 mSv y(-1).

The total uranium concentrations in each of two 24-h urine collections were analyzed separately at independent commercial laboratories by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). The mean and median concentrations were determined to be 4.5 ng L-1 and 2.8 ng L-1 respectively, from ICP-MS and 17 ng L-1 and 15 ng L-1, respectively, from INAA. The total uranium concentrations were sufficiently low so that isotopic (U-238:U-235 ratio) assays could not be performed directly from urine samples. Isotopic assays were performed on hair samples from 19 of the veterans participating in the testing. The isotopic hair assays were scattered around the natural U-238:U-235 ratio of 137.8, ranging from 122 +/- 21 to 145 +/- 16 (1sigma). Due to concern expressed in the media over possible depleted uranium exposure and long-term retention in bone, a single bone sample (vertebrate bone marrow) from a deceased member of the Canadian Forces was also analyzed for total uranium content and isotopic ratio by ICP-MS. The sample was shown to have 16.0 +/- 0.3 mug kg(-1) uranium by dry weight and a U-238:U-235 isotopic ratio of 138 +/- 4, consistent with natural uranium.

Due to these features this compact laser-based method is just becoming competitive to conventional ultra trace detection techniques like accelerator mass spectrometry or low level decay counting and gives access to a variety of demanding investigations. Starting from high resolution atomic spectroscopy on high lying Rydberg states or autoionizing levels, selective determination for a number of ultra trace istopes becomes feasible.

The intensities of IrAr, PtAr and AuAr relative to the atomic ions were found to be 1.8 x 10(-6), 1.6 x 10(-5) and 4.1 x 10(-5), respectively. The production of (IrAr)-Ir-193-Ar-40 is too small to interfere with the measurement of U-233, if the concentration of Ir is the same level as that of U-233. However, there is possibility that the presence of Pt and An interferes with the measurement of minor isotopes of uranium and Np-237. On the other hand, the mass biases of U-235/U-238 and Pb-208/Pb-206 were measured with the parameter of (UO)-U-238-O-16/U-238. Since unexpected change of the mass bias during measurements causes frequently erroneous results, the monitoring of (UO)-U-238-O-16/U-238 is effective for the precise isotope ratio measurement.

It has been found that the tritium concentration of exhaled water is equal to that in distilled water from urine. As a result, a new method has been developed to follow up each metabolism of two chemical forms, that is, free water tritium (FWT) and organically bound tritium (OBT) components in urine. In estimating the amount of retained tritium in the human body for a long time with their bioassay samples, it would vary depending upon the selection of samples. Moreover, a new tritium metabolic model has been developed by modifying a well-known. conventional three-compartment model, and verified with the measured data.

The C-14 activity in 1999 ranged from 14.4 to 14.8 dpm/g.C for those of tree rings and rices. The C-14 activities of oils were in good agreement with the present atmospheric one. The C-14 activities of flavors could differentiate petrochemically derived compounds from natural products. On the other hand, the delta(13)C value could distinguish between C-3 and C-4 plants for the main ingredient of oils, flavors and beers. For chickens and eggs, delta(13)C values reflected their diet. In addition, large variation of delta(13)C values was observed among components of eggs.

Large isotope effects are observed in tunneling reactions, which take place by passing through the potential energy barrier for a reaction. A very large isotope effect more than 3 x 10(4) was obtained in tunneling reactions H(D)+H-2(D-2) in gamma-rays-irradiated solid hydrogen at 4.2 K, though there is no isotope effect in a hot atom reaction. The isotope effect on H-2 or D-2 detachment from a 2,3-dimethylbutane cation, produced by gamma-radiolysis, amounts to a very large value of 1.7 x 10(4) at 77 K that indicates a tunneling detachment of a hydrogen molecule. The tunneling reaction of tritium atoms, produced by a He-3(n, p)T reaction, with H-2 or D-2 in liquid helium at 1.3 K shows a large isotope effect of 150. A large isotope effect (greater than or equal to20-50) was observed in the tunneling reaction of vitamin C and the long-lived protein radicals in biological systems. It is concluded that large isotope effects caused by a tunneling reaction play a role in radiation chemistry, a nuclear fusion technology and radiation biology.

The merits of the ERD technique is addressed briefly in the introduction and the general mass balance equations for hydrogen atoms in free and trapped states are commonly described, under simultaneous H and D irradiation which have been used for the analysis of the experimental data obtained systematically under different conditions. The three different experimental results are presented: (1) the isotope effects in retention of hydrogen isotopes (H and D) implanted independently and simultaneously into graphite at room temperature, (2) the isotope effects in thermal re-emission of hydrogen isotopes (H and D) from WC layer covered graphite and (3) the isotope effects between exchanges of D-implant in oxide ceramics by H in H2O-vapor and vice versa. The three experimental data are demonstrated to be well reproduced using the mass balance equations.

These hydrogenic solids are unique because of the extreme volatility and because the first step of the electronic sputtering process is identical for all hydrogenic solids. The sputtering for protons in the energy range from 5 to 10 keV can be qualitatively described by an electronic spike of cylindrical geometry. The sputtering yield of solid tritium has been evaluated on the basis of results for solid H-2, D-2 and HD.

J	Vietzke, E				Vietzke, E			Isotope dependence of the chemical erosion of graphite by hydrogen/deuterium implantation	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Symposium on Isotope Effects in Physics, Chemistry, and Engineering	AUG 22-24, 2001	NAGOYA, JAPAN			isotope effects; chemical erosion; hydrogen; deuterium; graphite; carbon materials; implantation; eV range 01-100; temperature dependence	BOMBARDMENT; YIELDS; IMPACT; IONS	Since graphite material is still a candidate for parts of planned fusion devices as ITER, the chemical erosion by hydrogen isotopes is a major concern. At energies of the impinging hydrogen below 100 eV, a strong isotope effect of the chemical erosion of carbon at low temperature is observed by hydrogen and deuterium ion impact. This effect is diminished at elevated temperatures around 800 K. For energies of the impinging hydrogen ion around 200 eV, only a minor isotope effect is observed in the maximum erosion yield at temperatures around 750 K. At low temperatures, the chemical erosion yields for these ion energies are much smaller than those for ions below 100 eV. Hydrogen/deuterium ions with energies of 1 keV and above show no isotope effect at all. Also in fusion devices as JET, TEXTOR and JT-60 an isotope effect in the chemical erosion of carbon materials is observed. The erosion yield in deuterium plasmas (T-e = 10-50 eV) is 1.3-1.5 of that in a hydrogen plasma. The multi-step process of chemical erosion of carbon materials by hydrogen isotopes is reasonably understood. The isotope effect is mainly caused by the radiation damage of the incident ions and by the ion-induced release process.

However, a quantitative consideration of the isotope exchange reaction on candidates for the first wall material has not been done yet. In this study we experimentally quantify the hydrogen isotope exchange reaction rates between hydrogen isotope in a gas phase and hydrogen isotope on the surface of isotropic graphite, C/C composite and SiC. The isotope effect is observed in every material used in this work. The reaction rate between H-2-gas and D-surface is faster than that between D-2-gas and H-surface in every material, though no isotope effect has been observed on the surface of solid breeder materials or metals as stainless steel, aluminum and copper in previous studies. It is also certified that the isotope effect on SiC surface is the largest among three materials studied in this work. The isotope effect in the isotope exchange reaction for various combination of hydrogen isotopes are estimated using Bigeleisen's equation.

Three models were considered: (1) recombination limited release, (2) bulk diffusion with subsequent recombination, and (3) fast bulk transport with slow skin layer diffusion followed by recombinative desorption. All the three models gave equally good agreement with experimental kinetic curves of tritium release. The decision about which model is valid can only be made having additional information. For the case of the particular experiment considered, this information was available, and it was concluded, that the skin layer model must be applied to this particular experiment. The recombination coefficient and the thickness of the layer were obtained.

The strange isotope effects of uranium gave a clue to solve the hidden isotope effects of electronic states. The present paper discusses recently observed isotope effects in two typical electron-exchange systems of amalgam formation and redox reactions in ion exchange chromatography. Attention has been placed on the temperature dependence of the isotopic fractionations. The results clearly show that the separation coefficient E is expressed by the temperature dependence of epsilon=a/T-2-b/T. The unit mass separation coefficients epsilon/DeltaM were calculated and compared among the examined elements of Li, Rb, Mg, Ba in the amalgam system and Fe, Cu, Eu in the redox ion exchange systems.

In this study, with the aim of applying the PSA method to a hydrogen isotope separation process, the multi-component adsorption characteristics of H-2-D-2 or H-2-HD-D-2, on a synthetic zeolite at the liquid nitrogen temperature 77.4 K are investigated by using a volumetric apparatus, where the system effects of thermal transpiration and diffusion are taken into account. The adsorption isotherms for pure H-2 and D-2 are shown in a wide pressure range between 10(-2) and 10(5) Pa. The isotherms are closely approximated by an error functional expression proposed here. The separation factors resulting in adsorption are measured in a wide range of amount adsorbed. The separation factors of D-2/H-2 are estimated in accordance with the ideal adsorbed solution theory using the adsorption isotherms for H-2 and D-2. The behavior of the estimated factors agrees with that of the experimental ones. The result suggests that values around 3 are expectable for the factors of D-2/H-2 at amounts adsorbed roughly between 0.01 and 1 mol/kg.

A solution of 0.4 mol.dm(-3) NH4Cl in methanol was continuously fed at 0.12, 0.25 and 0.50 cm(3).min(-1) into a glass tube packed with cryptand(2(B),2,1) polymer. The temperature of column was kept constant at 293 K by passing temperature-controlled water through a jacket. Nitrogen gas was generated from the effluent reacted with Ca(ClO)(2) solution after removing methanol by vacuum distillation, and the ratio of N-14 N-15 to (NN)-N-14-N-14 was measured with a mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT252). NH4Cl concentrations in the samples were gravimetrically determined. An enrichment factor, which is defined as an equilibrium separation factor minus unity was determined to be 0.0025 +/- 0.0013. A HETP (height equivalent to a theoretical plate) was evaluated 0.5 +/- 0.2 cm at 14 cm.h(-1). This is the first report on nitrogen isotope separation with cryptand polymer.

The temperature dependence of isotope enrichment factors was investigated at 273.2 to 323.2 K. Within the experimental error, the isotope effects appeared to be ruled by the conventional mass-dependent theory. The maximum isotope effect was observed at 323.2 K, whose isotope enrichment factor for unit mass difference was epsilon(u) =-0.00044 +/- 0.00013. Relation between epsilon(u) and 1/T showed a characteristic curve, but was deviated from a temperature-dependent theory of epsilon=a/T+b/T-2. The change in the coefficient a in the present system was discussed by considering the obtained results.

Strontium chloride was extracted into dicyclohexano-18-crown-6/chloroform from the aqueous phase of 4-9 M HCl/H2O. The distribution ratios of strontium increased with HCl concentrations. Strontium extracted into the organic phase had a complex form of Sr2+ crown, Sr2+- crown-HCl or Sr2+-crown-(HCl)(2) depending on the concentration of hydrochloric acid in the aqueous phase. Isotope enrichment factors changed from epsilon(84-88)=0.0075 to epsilon(84-88)=0.0263. The maximum, epsilon(84-88)=0.0263 was found at the complex form of Sr-crown-(HCl)(0.5) in the organic phase, where Sr-crown and Sr-crown-HCl coexisted at a ratio of 1 : 1. The enrichment factor dependency on HCl concentrations was found to be brought about from complex forms in the organic phase; Sr-crown in the diluted HCl system, Sr-crown-HCl in the medium HCl system, and Sr-crown-(HCl)(2) in the concentrated HCl system.

When about 2 Torr of Si2F6 was irradiated at a fluence of 1.0 J/cm(2) per pulse with the 10P(8) line of a TEA CO2 laser at 954.55 cm(-1), the compound decomposed very efficiently with high isotope selectivity. The products SiF4 and white solids were enriched with Si-29 and Si-30, while the residual Si2F6 was enriched with Si-28. The atomic fraction of Si-29 in residual Si2F6 increased with increasing decomposition of Si2F6; 99.9% of Si-28 was obtained at a consumption of 50% of initial Si2F6. The large-scale flow experiment yielded 99.7 % Si-28 at a production rate of 2.5 g/h, where a mixture of 3.3 Torr Si2F6 and 6.6 Torr argon was irradiated with 10P(8) laser pulses at a repetition rate of 5 Hz. Merits and demerits of the present laser separation are discussed in comparison to those of conventional separation methods. Laser enrichment of Si-28 seems promising for economical production of large quantity of pure Si-28. Various applications of silicon isotopes are briefly reviewed.

J	Zaki, EE				Zaki, EE			Electrodialysis of uranium(VI) through cation exchange membranes and modeling of electrodialysis processes	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							DONNAN DIALYSIS; TRANSPORT	The transport of ionic species through ion exchange membranes found several applications for water effluents purification and metal ion separation. To enhance the transport performance, the effect of electric fields was suggested in this work. The transport of U(VI) species in nitric acid solutions across cation exchange membranes was investigated. Different parameters affecting the transport of U(VI) were studied. These parameters include: nitric acid concentration in the feed solution, stripping solution concentration and applied electric field. From the results obtained. the cationic flux of U(VI) was 6.5.10(-8) geq.cm(-2.)s(-1) at the optimal conditions of 10(-3)M HNO3 in the feed solution, 0.5M Na2CO3 in the stripping solution and 30 V. The modeling of the electrodialysis process was also made. The model correlates the mass transfer as a function of current density and voltage as variables and takes into account the electro-osmotic effect. The model is applied to the experimental data.

The purpose of this research is to define a baseline study of man-made radionuclides on sediments along Gokova Bay, using a combination of direct gamma-spectrometry, radiochemical separation and alpha spectrometry. The analysis of these samples revealed measurable quantities of some artificial radionuclides namely: Pu239+240 (from 0.13+/-0.017 to 0.85+/-0.15 Bq.kg(-1)). Cs-137, Am-241, and Pu-238 were identified at a very low level. Concentration ratios of Pu-238 to Pu239+240 obtained seem to confirm that this artificial radioactivity is due mainly to Chernobyl accident.

The modified method of TESSIER was applied to separate readily available, carbonate, organic, Fe/Mn oxide and residual fractions. Plutonium isotope activity in soil as well as in particular separated fractions was determined by means of alpha spectrometry. The method of plutonium separation and purification for alpha-spectrometric measurements was modified according to the chemical properties of the extracted fraction. It was found that the major part (about 90%) of Pu-239,Pu-240 is bound to organic and Fe/Mn oxide fractions (in uncultivated soil samples of northwestern Poland and Chernobyl).

The diffusion behavior of H-3, Tc-99, L-125 Cl-36 and Sr-85 in granite, concrete and bentonite was studied in a specially designed diffusion cell. Diffusion coefficients (D, D-a) and time-lag (t(a)) were measured. break-trough curves were plotted and experimental data were interpreted to predict diffusion rates. The results showed that tritium, iodine and chlorine could be considered as non-sorbing tracers, while technetium was weakly and strontium was strongly sorbed (no break-through was observed during the period of the experiments).

The validity of the SSNTD technique utilized was checked by analysing uranium nitrate standard solutions. A relationship between water radon concentration and recharge of wells dug in two Moroccan Atlantic coastal regions, for a given Lithology, was found. The influence of the lithology and depth on radon concentration and salinity of well waters studied was investigated.

J	Gascon, JL				Gascon, JL			Evaporation rate in containers used for storing radioactive tracer solutions	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								In radiochemical analysis, the storage of a tracer solution is an important issue to bear in mind. The evaporation of the tracer solution depends on the type of container used for storing. In this paper the evaporation rate in four kinds of containers. i.e., flame-sealed glass ampoule, sealed glass flask, flame-sealed polyethylene ampoule and screw glass vial was studied. It is concluded that the evaporation rate depends on the system of closing.

Ce(III): cobalt, Co(II) thorium, Th(IV); and uranium U(VI) by Bacillus pumilus-LRW1, Bacillus cereus-LRW2 and Micrococcus lylae-LRW3 from aqueous solution was examined as a function of metal ion concentration, pH. temperature, and the presence of some foreign ions. The bacterial species exhibited high affinity to accumulate metal ions from their solutions at pH 4-5.0+/-0.5. The amount of each ion (in mg) accumulated by one gram dry weight of each bacteria was calculated. The uptake by the Bacillus cereus-LRW2 from aqueous solutions and simulated radioactive wastes were also investigated. Electron microscopic investigations showed that the ions were accumulated around the cell wall.

As part of the Environment Agency's (EA) full re-examination of Sellafield's discharge Authorisations under the Radioactive Substances Act 7993 (RSA93), technetium-99 (Tc-99) has warranted speck attention and has been subject to a period of public consultation. A Decision Document has recently been issued by the EA (currently awaiting the attention of the Minister), recommending that British Nuclear Fuels plc (BNFL) pursue further abatement of Tc-99 by implementing a scheme to route the major discharge stream to vitrification (solid waste). To support the Tc-99 review, BNFL was asked, by the EA, to undertake a best practicable environmental option (BPEO) study. A streamlined methodology was developed to meet the tight time-scales arid agreed with the EA. From the qualitative assessment of seven final options against seven criteria, the 'continue current operations' option was identified as the BPEO. It should be noted that the BPEO study concentrates on residual discharges of Tc-99, since current operations on the Sellafield site route greater than 90% of Tc-99 to vitrification. Recognising that the selection of a BPEO should be subject to review, BNFL asked NRG (Dutch consultants to the nuclear sector) to provide an independent peer review. In conclusion, the NRG review concurred that current operations represent BPEO, as identified in the BNFL study, but made some observations regarding the approach of the study and the methodology. The EA produced an Explanatory Document to assist the public consultation and included the BNFL BPEO study and the NRG review in the consultation documents. A,further review has also been undertaken by National Economic Research Associates (NERA) who reviewed the previous documentation and also applied a more formal multi-criteria analysis following guidance from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR). NERA arrived at the same conclusion, namely that the BPEO, on present evidence, was continuation of the present processes until the end of Magnox effluent reprocessing. The Tc-99 issue raises some significant points in terms of the effectiveness of BPEO assessments for radioactive discharges and the role that they play in informing the final decision as part of Authorisation reviews. There is a need for practitioners to better understand how to undertake, present and interpret BPEO while conceding that identifying the BPEO may not be enough.

J	Paavola, M				Paavola, M			Nuclear power in Finland	NUCLEAR ENERGY-JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH NUCLEAR ENERGY SOCIETY			English	Article						nuclear industry (civil); power stations (non-fossil fuel)		Energy plays a vital role in the country's economy and welfare. Due to Finland's cold climate, long transportation distances and energy-intensive industries, Finland's own energy resources are very limited. More than 70% of the primary energy demand in Finland is imported and more than half of that from one country only-Russia. Total energy consumption has stabilised in Finland but electricity consumption has grown steadily and it is forecast that this growth will continue into the future. Electricity generation is diversified and is based on the use of several fuels. The share of nuclear electricity is 27%. Operational experience of the,four Finnish nuclear reactors has been very good. Production has been reliable; for example, at Olkiluoto the average capacity factor over the past ten years is about 94%. The high utilisation rate coupled with lore,fuel costs proves that nuclear electricity has been very competitive in the deregulated electricity market and safety of production has not been compromised. With regard to the management of nuclear waste, Finland has resolved this problem. The law demands that spent nuclear fuel, and only Finnish spent fuel, shall be finally disposed of in the Finnish bedrock. The Finnish government has given approval in principle for the plans and parliament ratified them in the spring of 2001. The final repository will be located close to the existing power plant units at Olkiluoto at several hundred metres depth in two-billion-year-old bedrock. Safety authorities and the local municipality have approved the plans and the location for the repository. Studies show that nuclear generation costs in Finland are lower than those for coal and gas. Based on spring 2001 price levels, the studies indicate that nuclear electricity maintains its position even when the interest rate is varied by up to 10% per year. Teollisuuden Voima Oy (TVO) power company has submitted an application to the Finnish government for construction of an additional nuclear reactor in Finland. The main argument for the application is the need to produce safer, more economical and more environmentally friendly electricity without CO2 emissions. New plant would increase the security of electricity supple, decrease the dependence on electricity imports, replace old fossil fuel-based production capacity and offer, together with renewables, the most effective and economic way to meet greenhouse gas reduction targets. The application is for construction of one light-mater reactor with proposed capacity ranges of between 1000 and 1600 MW. Location would be one of the existing sites, either Loviisa or Olkiluoto.

The nummercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, PHOENICS-3.2 is used and the laminar and turbulent model code employed. The numerical predictions obtained are compared with the experimental data reported by Nishimura et al. [J. Nucl. Sci. Technol. 33 (1996) 821]. The computational results corresponding to laminar model agree well with the experimental data, but the calculated results of turbulent model are higher. The velocity pattern and the isotherms line drawn. With the increasing of Rayleigh number, the heat transfer in the cask changes from conduction dominant mode to convection dominant mode. In the condition of Ra-m = 1.3 x 10(9), turbulent model prevails. The convective heat transfer is so strong that almost all temperature changes take place in the region near the wall of the cask. The Rayleigh number Ra-m and the Nusselt number Nu(m) characterized by maximum temperature difference are defined to predict the heat transfer characteristics. It is found laminar and turbulent models predict the same trend but different value. The flow patterns in the cask can be divided to three regimes. In these three regimes, modified Nusselt numbers are proportional to the 0.7, 0.25 and 0 power of the modified Rayleigh number, respectively. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The objective of the program is to investigate whether the corium would lead to energetic steam explosion when interacted with cold water at a low pressure. The melt/water interaction is made in a multi-dimensional test section located in a pressure vessel. The inductive skull melting, which is basically a direct inductive heating of an electrically conducting melt, is implemented for the melting and delivery of corium. In the first series of tests using several kg of ZrO2 where the melt/water interaction is made in a heated water pool at 30-95 degreesC, either a quenching or a spontaneous steam explosion was observed. The spontaneous explosion observed in the present ZrO2 melt/water experiments clearly indicates that the physical properties of the UO2/ZrO2 mixture have a strong effect on the energetics of steam explosion.

J	Kiselev, GV				Kiselev, GV			About some principal possibilities for improvement of electronuclear system's characteristics	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								During the last few years in the leading Russian nuclear centers conceptual research of various versions of Accelerator Driven System (ADS) were conducted. This study stimulated an occurrence of a number of original new ideas, directed on the improvement of characteristics of ADS with the primary purpose of, effective destruction of long-lived radioactive waste (LLRW). The general idea relates to sectionalized blanket with compound neutron valve. The sectionalized blankets permits a two times decrease in the proton beam of accelerator. The compound neutron valve with Np layer allows an increase in the level of nuclear safety of blanket. The different versions of sectionalized blanket are considered. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

A limit to the measurement possibilities comes, however, from the simultaneous detection of two gamma-rays of a stop-over cascade (or "sum-up"), which cannot be distinguished from the true detection of the cross-over transition. We propose a new method to measure (and correct for) the sum-up effect, which can be used with symmetric gamma detector arrays (like GASP and GAMMASPHERE), and discuss the possible techniques for identifying and estimating quantitatively the contribution of random pile-up, which can be sizeable at high counting rate. These ideas have been experimented at GASP in a dedicated measurement with a radioactive source of Mn-52. The results of this measurement are presented and discussed. Moreover, as a significant example, the method is applied to deduce the intensity of the E3 cross-over transition from the lowest 3(-) state of Gd-148. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The N-16 is produced via the (n,p) reaction on 160 in the form of CO2 gas using 14-MeV neutrons from a commercially available Deuterium-Tritium (DT) generator, The N-16 is produced in a shielding pit in a utility room near the SNO cavity and transferred to the water volumes (D2O or H2O) in a CO2 gas stream via small diameter capillary tubing, The bulk of the activity decays in a decay/trigger chamber designed to block the energetic beta-particles yet permit the primary. branch 6.13 MeV gamma-rays to exit. Detection of the coincident P-particles with plastic scintillator lining the walls of the decay chamber volume provides a tag for the SNO electronics. This paper gives details of the production, transfer, and triggering systems for this source along with a discussion of the source gamma-ray. output and performance. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Balaz, J				Balaz, J			A photostimulation method for the study of pile-up and dead time effects in nuclear devices equipped with solid state detectors	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						pile-up; dead-time; photostimulation; solid state detector processing electronics	SPECTRAL DISTORTION; PULSE	Characterization of energetic particle spectrometers with respect to the pile-up and the dead time effects is a crucial task to eliminate systematic errors during processing of the data registered by the device. The task is of importance especially for particle spectrometers to be flown aboard space probes, since the dynamic range of the particle flux intensity is very wide and there is a problem to set an optimal geometrical factor to avoid countrate overloading on one hand and low statistics on the other. Extended characterization "in advance" can significantly improve the quality of the acquired data processing. With respect to limitations of electrical and radioisotope stimulation a practical method is proposed by photostimulation pulses with programmable (pseudo) random time and energy distribution-to simulate natural processes with a significant level of confidence.

The results of these measurements are in excellent agreement with each other and with those from another recent measurement. Consequently, Ga-66 emission probabilities for 18 strong lines, from 834 to 4806 keV, are now known to better than 1% accuracy. Thus, Ga-66 can now be considered a suitable radionuclide for Ge detector efficiency calibration up to an energy of 4806 keV, the highest energy attainable with radioactive calibration sources. We have also provided an empirical function for correcting earlier incorrect emission probability results for E-gamma greater than about 3 MeV which were produced using an inappropriate efficiency curve extrapolation.
