A single, ferrihydrite-like component is found to reasonably describe uranyl uptake to a number of kaolinitic iron-rich natural substrates at pH > 4 in the CA approach with previously published information on nature of surface complexes, acid-base properties of surface sites and electrostatic effects used in the model. The GC approach, in which little pre-knowledge about generic surface sites is assumed, gives even better fits and would appear to be a method of particular strength for application in areas such as performance assessment provided the model is developed in a careful, stepwise manner with simplicity and goodness of fit as the major criteria for acceptance.

The method is based on the measurement of the solid-liquid concentration distribution ratio (fd) Of background stable Ni. To verify the method, the K-d's of both the radioactive Ni and stable Ni were simultaneously measured by using three different samples through batch sorption experiments in which radioactive Ni with a constant concentration and stable Ni with various concentrations coexisted. The f(d) of background stable Ni was then measured by extraction with 0.1N CH3COONH4 and 0.1N HCl solutions to compare f(d) with K-d. The results showed that the K-d's Of radioactive Ni agreed with those of stable Ni, and that the f(d) corresponded to the K-d when the Liquid-phase concentration of stable Ni approached the background level. This indicates that the method of evaluating K-d by using f(d) is applicable to Ni within the experiment.

The uranium(VI) concentration was 1 x 10(-6) M and the HA concentration was 5 and 60 mg/L, respectively. The solid/solution ratio was 12.5 g/L. Furthermore, we studied the uranium and HA sorption on ferrihydrite (3 x 10(-4) M Fe) and compared the results to the sorption behavior of phyllite. The study showed that the uranium sorption onto phyllite and onto its mineral constituents is influenced by the pH-dependent sorption behavior of the HA. Due to high HA sorption onto the solids in the acidic pH range the uranium uptake is enhanced compared to the uranium uptake in the absence of HA. A high concentration of dissolved HA in the near-neutral pH range reduces the uranium sorption due to formation of aqueous uranyl humate complexes. Furthermore, we could show that the high uranium and HA sorption on phyllite is primarily caused by minor amounts of the secondary mineral ferrihydrite that is formed due to weathering of phyllite. Thus, the ferrihydrite predominates the contributions of the main minerals quartz, muscovite, chlorite, and albite, that are naturally present in the rock material phyllite.

The partition coefficients for both U(VI) and Np(V) on hydrothermally altered concrete are significantly lower than those on untreated concrete. The partition of both U(VI) and Np(V) are pH dependent, although the pH dependence does not appear to reflect precipitation of U and Np-bearing phases. Both sorption and precipitation are Likely processes controlling partitioning of U to concrete; sorption is the most likely process controlling the partitioning of Np to concrete. The presence of 0.01 M carbonate species in solution decreases K-d of U(VI) for both hydrothermally altered and untreated concrete from greater than or equal to 10(4) mL/g to similar to 400 to 1000 mL/g indicating a significant impact on U(VI) sorption. In contrast, the presence of carbonate only reduced the Kd Of Np(V) by one order of magnitude or less. X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis of U/concrete mixtures at different pHs and times indicate that uranyl ions are partitioned as monomeric species on untreated concrete, but oligomeric species on hydrothermally altered concrete. Similar analysis of Np/concrete mixtures shows that about half of the partitioned Np(V) is reduced to Np(TV) over a period of 6 months.

The long-term alteration products and processes of uraninite may provide insight into the corrosion of the UO2 in spent nuclear fuel. Uraninite, schoepite, calciouranoite, uranophane, fourmarierite, a Fe-rich uranyl phase, and coffinite were identified. The primary uraninites and alteration phases generally have low trace element contents, except for coffinite from Caribou Mine, Colorado that has Y2O3 as high as 0.88 wt %. The highest Zr, Ti, Th and REE values of the uraninite are ThO2 0.17, Y2O3 0.28, La2O3 0.03, Ce2O3 0.10, Pr2O3 0.02, Nd2O3 0.14, Sm2O3 0.12, Eu2O3 0.04, Gd2O3 0.08, ZrO2 0.93 and TiO2 0.54 wt%, which are in general lower than the corresponding components in secondary uranyl phases (the highest values are ThO2 0.21, Y2O3 0.88 La2O3 0.05, Ce2O3 0.15, Pr2O3 0.05, Nd2O3 0.18, Sm2O3 0.14, Eu2O3 0.11, Gd2O3 0.08, ZrO2 2.11, and TiO2 2.74 wt %), suggesting that trace elements preferentially enter the structures of these secondary uranyl phases (Table 2). A compositional profile of a concentric structure in schoepite shows that, with increasing alteration, UO2, PbO and ZrO2 decrease, and SiO2, TiO2, CaO and P2O5 increase. Alteration causes loss of U, Pb and Zr and incorporation of Si, Ti, Ca and P into uranyl phases. The Ca-rich calciouranoite from Grants, New Mexico, indicates an interaction between the limestone host rock. and uranium minerals. Texturally, concentric structures and micro-fractures are common. Concentric structures are usually composed of both uraninite and uranyl phases, while micro-fractures are common in the secondary phases.

Fracture-filling material was collected from a 3 mm thick fracture at depth 74.8-75 m (drillcore R348). SEM and EDS analyses on a thin section of the original fracture-filling show that the fracture filling is heterogeneous, composing mineral crystal particles and very porous clay-rich aggregates. The results of INAA on millimetre-sized single mineral crystals and aggregates selected from grinded fracture-filling show that porous aggregates (composed of clays and micrometer sized mineral particles) contain up to 1000 ppm U, which is higher than the average of the whole fracture-filling (400 ppm) and host rock related millimetre sized mineral particles (18-100 ppm). U-233/U-238 isotope exchange proves that a large fraction of the uranium in the fracture-filling is not easily exchanged with uranium in the solution. The amount of U-238 released in the isotope exchange experiment is too high to be explained by reversible U(VI) sorption. Oxidation state analyses show that 30% of the uranium exists as U(IV). Laboratory batch experiment at anoxic conditions proved that pyrite can immobilise U(VI).

This data base may provide a link of the fluorescence spectra of the minerals to solution spectra containing so far unknown tertiary and quaternary solution complexes in environmental uranium(VI)-containing waters. In our initial effort to establish the data base, we are focusing on phosphate- and arsenate-containing uranium(VI) minerals. Except for chernikovite [(H3O)(2)(UO2)(2)(PO4)(2). 6H(2)O], these minerals show intensive fluorescence emissions bands with a bathochromic shift of up to 18 nm compared to the fluorescence of the uranyl ion in solution. We found hypsochromic shifts of the fluorescence emission for the uranyl phosphates and bathochromic shifts for the uranyl arsenates. The band spacing of the fluorescence emissions from the 20502 cm(-1) level are comparable to the vibrational frequency available from IR-data. Using these data we estimated the axial U-O bond lengths. The decrease of the vibration frequency from 813cm(-1) (saleite, [Mg(UO2)(2)(PO4)(2). 10(H2O)]) to 794cm(-1) (uranocircite, [Ba(UO2)(2)(PO4)(2). 12(H2O)]) is related to a slight increase of the U-O bond length by 3 pm. In both series, the fluorescence lifetime decreases with decreasing crystal water. This is different compared to solution spectra where the Lifetime increases as water is displaced from the inner coordination shell. Comparing the fluorescence data of the mineral troegerite [H-2(UO2)(2)(AsO4)(2).8(H2O)] with the fluorescence spectra of uranyl arsenate solutions, we identified one of the three uranyl arsenate complexes in solution as HUO2(AsO4)(aq.).

Elevated U content (57 ppm) was observed in fracture smectite sampled from the surface of water-carrying fracture in granite pegmatite at a depth of 70 m. The current groundwater conditions are oxidising at the sampled point. The U-234/U-238 activity ratio (AR) measured in the bulk U and in its sequentially extracted phases, displays unusually low value (around 0.30). Low AR indicates preferential loss of the U-234 isotope from the system. Because the U-234 loss can also be seen in the Th-230/U-234 activity ratio (clearly over 1), the selective removal of the U-234 isotope must have taken place more recently than what is needed to equilibrate Th-230/U-234 pair (i.e. 350000 a). To explain the selective U-234 loss from the smectite we postulate that bulk U is in reduced +4 form and a considerable part of the U-234 isotope in easily leachable oxidised +6 form. This study suggests that the long-term chemical stability of the bulk U in the smectite is due to irreversible fixation of U in the reduced +4 form.

Of particular concern is the association of radionuclides with subterranean microbial cells and their subsequent transport as biocolloids. We characterized the total microbial populations in two groundwater samples: one from the Culebra dolomite member of the Rustler Formation at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), NM, and the other from the granitic formation at the Grimsel Test Site (GTS), Switzerland. Culebra groundwater (ionic strength 2.8 M, pH 7) contained 1.51+/-1.08 x 10(5) cells ml(-1), with a mean cell length of 0.75+/-0.04 mum and width of 0.58+/-0.02 mum. In contrast, low ionic-strength GTS groundwater (0.001 M, pH 10) contained 3.97+/-0.37 x 10(3) cells ml(-1), with a mean cell length of 1.50+/-0.141 mum and width of 0.37+/-0.01 mum. Adding appropriate electron donors and accepters to the groundwaters facilitated the growth of aerobic, denitrifying, fermentative, and acetogenic microorganisms. Uranium biosorption was studied in two isolates from these groundwaters, as well as several pure cultures from saline and non-saline environments. Halophilic and non-halophilic bacteria exhibited differences in the amount of U associated with the cells. Plutonium uptake by Acetobacteriurn sp, isolated from GTS varied from 30-145 pg of mu mg(-1) dry weight of cells.

The distribution of uranium amongst fractions obtained by both methods was determined using ICP-MS. Humic material isolated from electrophoretic fractions was characterised using FTIR and W-vis spectroscopy, base titration, Sephadex G200 size fractionation and CHN elemental analysis. Both size and chemical separation occurred during electrophoretic fractionation with the smaller, more hydrophilic molecules being more electrophoretically mobile. The gel chromatographic and gel electrophoretic studies showed that the association of U in soils was skewed towards the larger humic molecules but that some association with certain smaller humic molecules warrants further work to characterise the behaviour of these complexes under Varying environmental conditions.

Using two different sequential extraction methods, we have studied the partitioning of U and Pu to an acidic, sandy lake sediment that was contaminated due to nuclear production activities. We fmd that both methods yield similar partitioning information, and that much of the U is associated with insoluble phases, whereas the majority of the Pu is extracted with oxidizable phases, defined to be predominantly organic matter. Our study suggests that U in this ecosystem is of natural origin. Although Pu and Fe in this system are known to cycle from the sediments to the water column during periods of anoxia, only a low percentage of Pu is extracted from the phases that are reducible, which are operationally defined as amorphous Fe oxides.

The K-d values for trace Cs-137 in, 0.02 M NaCl were typically around 10(4) mL/g, and were not affected by the pH. However, the K-d decreased with increasing ionic strength, and was strongly dependent on the total Cs concentration. Much lower K-d values (around 10(2) mL/g) were measured in systems containing total Cs of 1 mmol/L in a background electrolyte of 0.10 M NaCl. The main factor determining the sorption behaviour of U(VI) in systems equilibrated with air was the pH, with the K-d decreasing from above 10(3) mL/g at pH 7 to around 10 mL/g at pH 9.

Low concentrations of naturally occurring U and Th decay series nuclides, including Pb-210, and artificial radioisotopes (Sb-125, (CS)-C-134, Cs-137, Am-241) were determined using low-level gamma -spectrometry. In addition, the activities of Pu-238 and Pu-239,Pu-240 were determined by radiochemical separation and alpha -spectrometry, C-14 and excess Pb-210 dating methods were used to date the sampled bog profiles. The different radionuclides show characteristic depth distributions in the forest and bog soil horizons, which were sub-sampled as thin slices. Sb-125, Am-241, Pu-238 and Pu-239,Pu-210 are strongly fixed in soil organic matter. In spruce forest soils, the influence of soil horizons with distinct properties dominates the vertical time-dependent distribution. In ombrotrophic bogs, the peak positions correlate with the year of maximum input of each nuclide. The Sb, Am and Pu "time markers" and the C-14 and Pb-210 dating results correspond very well. Although Cs seems to be relatively mobile in organic as well as mineral forest soil horizons, it is enriched in the organic material. In ombrotrophic bogs, Cs is very mobile in the peat deposit. In Sphagnum peat, Cs is translocated continuously towards the growing apices of the Sphagnum mosses, where it is accumulated.

Further processing with solvent extraction (DEHPA/TOPO) was used aiming to recover uranium from the phosphoric acid. The distribution of natural radionuclides with long physical half-life of the U-238 and Th-232 decay series involved in these operations was evaluated. The radionuclides Ra-226, R-228 and Pb-210 were found to predominate in the phosphogypsum, while Th-228, Th-230 and Th-232 in uranium-free phosphoric acid.

The determination of solubility limits of the main radioelements contained in the spent nuclear fuel is a necessary work to understand their potential migration in both the near and far fields. The calculated solubilities are compared to experimental data from relevant spent nuclear fuel dissolution tests and field observations from natural systems, particularly Natural Analogue study sites. This work discusses the main uncertainties associated to the calculated solubilities, particularly those related to the variability of groundwater composition, redox conditions and temperature of the system. The results of the sensivity analysis indicate that although the solubility of some radioelements, such as Th, is not dramatically affected by the uncertainty in the determination of the physico-chemical parameters mentioned above, most of the elements are strongly influenced by this variability, specially Am, U, Np, Pu and Tc.

The results of the batch and column mode experiments clearly showed that the aminophosphonate resin was an efficient exchanger for the removal of uranium at pH values close to 5 and the SEA resin at higher pH values. In the column experiments, where altogether 2000 bed volumes of drinking water simulant, were processed with these exchangers, the uptake of uranium was as high as 99.8% by the aminophosphonate resin at pH 5 and 99.7 % by the SEA resin at pH 8.

Part 2 - "Hot" continuous counter-current experiment	RADIOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						actinide; lanthanides; separation; DIAMEX process; centrifugal extractor	EXTRACTION; N,N,N',N'-TETRAALKYL-2-ALKYL-PROPANE-1,3-DIAMIDES	Among several processes proposed world-wide, the French DIAMEX (DIAMide EXtraction) process seems to be very efficient for the removal of Minor Actinides (MA) from genuine High Level Liquid Waste (HLLW). The MA are in this process directly extracted from the PUREX (Plutonium Uranium Redox EXtraction) raffinate together with fission lanthanides using the completely combustible diamide extractant. In this work a hot demonstration of the DIAMEX process using genuine high-level PUREX raffinate is reported. The continuous counter-current experiment was carried out in a 16 stage centrifugal extractor battery, installed in a hot cell. In order to produce a representative HLLW a PUREX process was applied on dissolved fuel using the same equipment. In the DIAMEX process up to 6 extraction stages were sufficient to achieve feed decontamination factors between 100 and 230 for lanthanides and above 300 for minor actinides. Go-extraction of molybdenum and zirconium were efficiently prevented using oxalic acid scrubbing. The back extraction proved to be very efficient, yielding in 4 stages more than 99.9 % recovery of both the lanthanides and the actinides. Go-extracted ruthenium, technetium, palladium and neptunium are less efficiently back-extracted requiring further process development.

Mathematical models are particularly useful in the design and optimization of ion exchange columns to predict the characteristics of the breakthrough curve under a given set of conditions. A systematic mathematical model for prediction of the concentration profile of in-going cation (strontium) to a zeolite fixed bed as a function of time or eluted volume, to obtain the shape of the exchange zone, has been developed. The model was verified by experiments of 0.2 N sodium nitrate solution with 5x10(-5) Sr2+ using three different types of natural zeolites. A Fortran-77 computer program was designed to run the model on IBM computer. The model was used Co examine how the concentration profiles are affected by the operating parameters. A rough calculation of Reynolds Number was carried out to check the flow regime operating on the used column.
