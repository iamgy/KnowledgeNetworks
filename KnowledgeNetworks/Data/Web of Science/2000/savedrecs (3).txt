J	Cepraga, DG; Cambi, G; Frisoni, M				Cepraga, DG; Cambi, G; Frisoni, M			Resonance shielding-factor cross-section processing technique validation based on tungsten decay heat experimental data	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 19-24, 1999	ROME, ITALY			ANITA-4M; neutron; tungsten		This study presents a method to obtain corrected self-shielded radiative capture cross-sections for tungsten isotopes to be used for activation calculations. The approach used is based on the application of the Bondarenko shielding factor method to the 175-group AMPX master library by means of the Bonami-Nitawl scale-4.3 sequence calculation The ANITA-4M activation code calculates the tungsten radioisotopes production and the decay heat using the self-shielded cross-sections from ENDF/B-VI, JEF-2.2 and JENDL-3.2 data files. Two irradiation scenarios (5 min and 7 h) in the international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER)-like neutron flux spectrum defined by the fusion neutron source experiments are analyzed. The unshielded calculations result in discrepancy with experiment up to 70%, while the self-shielding treatment reduces drastically that discrepancy to less than few percents. In comparison to the experimental integral decay heat values provides a validation of the method used to deal with the self-shielding treatment. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

One was a small duct streaming experiment for diagnostic ports, the other was a large duct streaming experiment for large ports such as neutral beam injector (NBI) port. The ducts increased the neutron flux above 10 MeV by 10(6)-10(7) times at the ends of the ducts, while the increase of neutron flux below 10 MeV and gamma -ray by the ducts was less than a few hundred times. These experiments were analyzed by the MCNP-4A code with three nuclear data libraries: FENDL/E-2.0, -1.0 and JENDL Fusion File. Though the ducts made complicated neutron and gamma -ray flux distributions in a cavity region, most of the calculated results agreed within +/- 40% with the experimental data. It was demonstrated that the MCNP calculations with the nuclear data libraries were accurate enough for predicting nuclear design parameters of ITER even for Various duct geometries as far as they were modeled precisely.

Li-Al alloy (Li 3.4 wt.%, 95.5% enrichment of (6)Li) was selected as tritium monitor material for the evaluation on the total amount of tritium production in high (6)Li enriched materials. From the results of preliminary experiment, calculated amounts of total tritium production at each 'tritium monitor', which was installed in the preliminary in-pile mock-up, were about 50-290% higher than the measured values. Concerning tritium measurement, increase of measurement error in tritium leak form measuring system to measure small amount of tritium (0.2-0.7 mCi in tritium monitor) was found in the results of present experiment. The tendency for overestimation of calculated thermal neutron flux in the range of 1-6 x 10(13) n cm(-2) per s was found in JMTR and the reason may be due to the beryllium cross section data base in JENDL3.2.

The permeation rate from Flibe was much larger for HT than that for T+. The overall mass transfer coefficient of HT permeation from Flibe, K-2, was 10-50 times smaller than that of HT release from Flibe to the gas phase, K-1. The activation energy of K-2 was larger than that of K-1. The rate-determining process of tritium permeation is considered not to be HT diffusion in the Flibe liquid film, but to be the HT migration from Flibe surface to metal surface, where oxides formed by the impurity in Flibe may accumulate as a tritium permeation barrier.

Therefore, tritium release experiments from Li2TiO3 packing region were carried out to evaluate the effects of various parameters, i.e. sweep gas flow rate, irradiation temperature, and hydrogen content in sweep gas, etc. on tritium release. As for the shape of the Li2TiO3, a small spherical form (pebbles) is preferred to reduce the induced thermal stress in the breeding material. The diameter and total weight of Li2TiO3 pebbles were 1 mm and similar to 135 g, respectively. And the integrated experiment of blanket in-pile mockup with Li2TiO3 pebble bed was carried out at the Japan Materials Testing Reactor (JMTR). The tritium released from Li2TiO3 pebble bed was swept by the helium gas with hydrogen. The total tritium concentration (HT + HTO) and gaseous tritium concentration (HT) of tritium released from Li2TiO3 pebbles were measured, and HT/(HT + HTO) ratio was evaluated under various conditions.

J	Damiani, C				Damiani, C			ITER divertor maintenance L7 R&D project - results and perspectives	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 19-24, 1999	ROME, ITALY			ITER reactor; in-vessel cassette maintenance environment; hot cell refurbishment operations		The availability of International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) (or an 'ITER-like') reactor will be strongly influenced by the effectiveness of the in-vessel components remote handling strategy. In the present reactor concept, the relevant key components are the divertor cassettes, located in the lower region of the Vacuum vessel. Due to erosion and damage to the divertor plasma facing components, estimated scheduled replacement of the cassettes will be required eight times during the machine lifetime. Moreover, for such an experimental tokamak where completely new plasma regimes will be established, unscheduled interventions cannot be excluded a priori. To test and optimise the divertor maintenance scenario, the so called ITER L7 R&D project has been realised at the ENEA Brash-none laboratories, with a full scale simulation of the in-vessel cassette maintenance environment and of the hot cell refurbishment operations. The basic demonstration of the validity of the current scenario has been established, and now new activities' are in progress to optimise many aspects of the operations (procedures, hardware improvements, reliability, etc.). Based on the background and the results of these activities, this paper discusses the lessons learned during the project implementation, and identifies key points of the current strategy that should be maintained for any new design of ITER or an 'ITER-like' reactor.

The cassettes will be withdrawn from the Vessel through dedicated ducts and they will be transported to a hot cell for refurbishment. The divertor refurbishment platform (DRP) simulates the arrangement in the divertor hot cell for cassette inspection, component replacement and repair, measuring, and testing. The DRP had to demonstrate the feasibility of divertor cassette refurbishment, procedures, and the use of conventional remote handling equipment in a hot cell, for the refurbishment of high heat flux components (also called plasma facing components PFC), cassette locking systems, water feeds and post-repair, integrity testing. The true environmental conditions (temperature, atmosphere, radiation, contamination) have not been replicated in the DRP, but they were taken into account in the development of the mock ups, the remote handling equipment, and the operating procedures. The results permit to validate the hot cell operations for the cassette refurbishment and to specify the hot cell requirements.

As a result, a equivalent fusion multiplication factor of Q(DT)(eq) = 1.25 was achieved in a transient state and Q(DT)(eq) = 0.5 was sustained for similar to0.8 s in the reversed shear discharges. It was then shown that active control schemes of stored energy and neutron emission rate were effective for the production of these high performances. The internal transport barrier was sustained for similar to5 s in reversed shear plasma with off-axis LHCD. In the high-beta (p) mode of operation, simultaneous achievement of high confinement, high beta, and full non-inductive current drive with a large fraction of bootstrap current was demonstrated. For the stabilization of the neoclassical tearing mode, the ECRF system was introduced and the injection power into the plasma of 680 kW for 2 s and 250 kW for 5 s was achieved. With the negative-ion based neutral beam injection, the current drive efficiency increased to similar to1.3 x 10(19)A/W per m(2). The W-shaped divertor with pumping was effective for reducing deuterium recycling, carbon impurity influx, heat load on the target tiles and the II-mode threshold power as well.

The estimation of the beam characteristics is very important for the enhancement and optimization of the beam power. The following four items have been used as the characterization of the beam: neutron yield from the beamline, beam divergence, heat load on the beamline components and beam profile on the armor plate in the tokamak Vacuum vessel. Since the beam power accelerated in the ion source is proportional to the neutron yield in the beamline components, the operation status of deuterium negative ion current can be monitored easily. The beam divergence estimated at the drift duct and ion dumps, and the heat load on the beamline components are used for the optimization of the ion source operation parameters and the evaluation of neutral beam injection power. The beam divergence measured at the drift duct is 4 mrad in the horizontal direction, 6 mrad in the vertical, which are in agreement with the design value of 5 mrad. The deposition profile on the armor plate is used for monitoring of the neutral beam profile. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Vezzani, M; Cerullo, N; Lanza, S				Vezzani, M; Cerullo, N; Lanza, S			Energetic-economic analysis of inertial fusion plants with tritium commercial production	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 19-24, 1999	ROME, ITALY			cost of electricity; ICF plant; tritium surplus production	HYLIFE-II; REACTOR; DESIGN; IMPROVEMENTS	The realization of nuclear power plants based on fusion principles is expected to be, at the moment, very expensive. As a result the expected cost of electricity (COE) of fusion power plants is much higher than the COE of fission and fossil power plants. Thus it is necessary to study new solutions for fusion power plant designs to reduce the COE. An interesting solution for the first generation of fusion plants is to produce a surplus of tritium for commercial purposes. The present paper is concerned with the study of whether such a tritium surplus production can improve the plant economic balance, so that the COE is reduced, and to what extent. The result was that such a production allows a considerable reduction of COE and seems to be a good direction for development for the first generation of fusion power plants. To give an example, for a reference inertial confinement fusion (ICF) power plant the rise of the plant net tritium breeding ratio (TBR(n)) from 1 to 1.2 would allow, in the conservative estimate of a tritium market price (C(T)) of 5 M$/kg, a COE reduction of about 20%. In the estimate of a TBR(n), rise from 1 to 1.3 and of a C(T) value of 10 M$/kg, COE reduction could be more than 50%! In conclusion, the present paper points out the influence of TBR increase on COE reduction. Such a conclusion, which holds true for every fusion plant, is much more valid for ICF plants in which it is possible to reach higher TBR values and to use tritium extraction systems easily. Thus, considering the relevant economic advantages, a commercial tritium surplus production should not be disregarded for first generation fusion power plant designs, in particular for ICF plant designs.

Two atomic deuterium beams, with 1 MeV energy and each with at least 16.7 MW power, are the reference for the engineering design of the system. The design of NE system developed for the ITER final design report (FDR) [1] is being modified to comply with the reduced size of the machine and to incorporate, if possible, some design improvements and simplifications. The analyses of overall power distribution and the maximum power densities on each of the beamline components have been updated. To obtain 16.7 MW neutral beam power, 35 MW ion beam power at the exit of the accelerator is necessary. Therefore, about 18 MW are deposited on the beamline components. Moreover, during the commissioning of the injectors, and the high voltage conditioning of the beam source, the full beam power is dumped and measured on a calorimeter. The beamline requires actively cooled high heat flux (HHF) components to exhaust high power density (up to 15 MW/m(2)) in steady state conditions. The operative life of this components (30 000 beam-on/beam off cycles, without replacement) requires, primarily, the verification of thermal fatigue safety margins. This paper describes the most relevant aspects of the mechanical design of the HHF components, focusing on the thermal and mechanical verifications. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

The samples consist of a hot-pressed powder metallurgy product and a plasma-sprayed product. The number of molecules outgassed from a plasma-sprayed sample is ten times that outgassed from a press-sintered sample and a higher desorption temperature is necessary to outgas a plasma-sprayed sample. The majority of the molecules outgassed from each sample type are in the form of hydrogen molecules and water vapor. Tn addition, the post-plasma-exposure desorption of deuterium from both products are compared. Following identical plasma exposures at close to room temperature, a factor of ten less deuterium is retained in plasma-sprayed samples, presumably due to the columnar structure of the resultant sprayed material that would have enhanced pathways to the sample surface. After higher surface temperature exposure (approximate to 500 degreesC), the retention in the plasma-sprayed material is a factor of three less than the retention in the pressed-powder material. Finally, the impact on deuterium retention of carbon-containing surface layers formed during the plasma exposure is evaluated. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Thus, it is necessary to evaluate the fuel hydrogen retention and the erosion of such mixed materials. In the present study, the deuterium desorption spectra were examined upon deuterium ion irradiation for the materials with tungsten concentrations of 6, 13 and 32 at.%. Two desorption peaks appeared at approximately 150 and 700 degreesC. The peaks at 150 and 700 degreesC correspond to the desorptions from tungsten and carbon, respectively. The peak height at 150 degreesC increased and that at 700 degreesC decreased as the tungsten concentration increased. The total amount of deuterium retained was reduced by the addition of tungsten, as compared with a case of graphite. The desorption of CD(4) largely decreased with the tungsten concentration increase. The present data show that both the hydrogen retention and the chemical erosion of carbon-tungsten mixed material were reduced, as compared to graphite. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

For the test of the integrity of the multi-layer structure, two types of pebble were fabricated and irradiated by high flux beams. The one has a SIC kernel, and the other has a carbon kernel. Each type of pebble had a SiC tritium permeation barrier layer and a graphite plasma facing layer. These pebbles were irradiated by 6.7 MW/m(2) of electron beam and 6.2 x 10(21) D/m(2) of high particle flux deuterium beam. After the irradiation, they were examined the failure of the coating layers and the sputtering yield of the surface layer. On the carbon kernel pebbles, no cracks and failures of the coating layers were detected after the irradiation. The test results of SiC kernel pebbles indicated there were some failures at the interface between a SiC layer and a surface graphite layer due to the fabrication process.

The experiments described in this paper represent the conclusive part of a test program started in 1994. The properties of non-irradiated Be/Cu joints have been characterised in a previous test campaign. Post-irradiation tests are now being carried out to investigate the neutron damage on the joints. The neutron irradiation on selected mock-ups has been carried out in the High Flux Reactor (HFR) at Petten (The Netherlands). Parametric finite element thermal analyses have been carried out to establish the allowable heat flux value to be applied during the tests. Screening tests up to power densities of similar to7 MW/m(2) and thermal fatigue tests up to 1000 cycles have been performed. None of these mock-ups showed any indication of failure. Post-mortem analyses (metallography, SEM) have also been conducted. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A significant modification of the ITER divertor cassette design was undertaken in the summer of 1997 with the removal of the so-called 'wings'. This highlighted the necessity to protect the cold (150 degreesC) pumping duct from radiated heat and particle flux from the plasma chamber. A cold duct has the potential to trap unacceptably high levels of tritium in the redeposited carbon films produced from erosion of the vertical target. To provide protection that minimises the uptake of tritium, a new semi-transparent liner operating with hot tungsten (W) tiles was proposed by the ITER Joint Central Team (JCT) and was developed by the RF Home Team. This liner design promises to minimise the amount of tritium trapped in it by operating with the surface temperature of the W in the range 800-1200 degreesC. Radiatively cooled tiles on the surface of the liner maintain the surface temperature between these limits, for a surface heat flux of between 0.1 and 0.35 MW/m(2), a range which takes into account the uncertainties in the predicted operational heat loads. This paper reports on the predicted operational regime of the liner which allows effective transformation of incoming atomic tritium and carbon into stable hydrocarbons, that can be pumped safely to the reprocessing plant. The role of hydrocarbons las molecules and radicals) is assessed. A sensible parametric analysis of tritium retention, on the liner surface and on cold areas behind the liner, was performed for different conditions and operational parameters.

Furtheron, flakes from TEXTOR with thick a-C:D-layers (D/C approximate to 0.04, thickness approximate to 20 +/- 5 mum, total boron and metal content 15 weight-%) were oxidised in O(2) (21 kPa), showing a stepwise process: At 573 K a weight-loss of 25% was found before rate drops; temperature increase to 623 K leads to gasification of additional 35% with a maximum layer reduction rate of 0.25 mum/h. Complete gasification of the carbon remaining in the ash requires temperatures of up to 773 K. a-C:D-layers are compared with nuclear graphites, indicating, that the latter react much slower in oxygen but not in ozone. Different a-C:D-specimen examined up to now are discussed and for a tritium removal method in oxygen/air a temperature of at least 673 K (160 K higher than the ITER reference value) is proposed.

The contamination process was observed by spectroscopy, and the intensity distribution of WI showed migration of W onto the C side by the successive cycles of sputtering and prompt redeposition,On the other hand, the deposition of C on the W surface was not obvious. Most of the hydrogen (deuterium) on the limiter was found to be retained in the deposited layers and that in the deposited C layer much higher than that in the deposited W layer. This indicates that tritium retention is smaller in metallic deposits above 500 K. The AES analysis conducted after the exposure of the test limiter showed that W deposited on C reacted with the substrate to form carbides at higher temperatures. The thickness of carbide layer, and/or the content of W in C were influenced by the temperature and flux distributions, and no carbide layer was formed at the limiter edge where the temperature was relatively low.

In addition, their excellent plasma performance has been demonstrated. Carbon based materials have been chosen for protection of high heat flux components, in particular to off-normal operation, e.g. disruption, plasma excursion, whilst beryllium has been proposed as a PFC material for getting oxygen impurity in plasma. However, as next generation D/T plasma devices, i.e. International thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER) producing intense neutron fluxes, substantial R&D is needed to elucidate the effects of neutron-induced damage on the microstructure and critical properties of these materials (e.g. thermal conductivity, swelling, and tritium trapping) because they could limit the use of these materials in next generation fusion devices. Neutron induced changes in thermal conductivity, dimensional stability, mechanical properties as well as behaviour of tritium interaction are crucial problems which need to be better understood. The assessed neutron Aux of ITER will be similar to 3.5-9.0 x 10(14) cm(-2) s(-1) for the first wall, whilst the neutron flux for the divertor is similar to 1-3 x 10(14) cm(-2) s(-1), which leads to a damage of similar to 10-20 dpa for the first wall and 3-6 dpa for the divertor for 1 full power year of operation. In the framework of European Fusion R&D Programs, an extensive effort on neutron effects of PFC materials is being undertaken. This paper presents the first results of experiments performed to investigate the effects of thermal annealing on neutron damage of thermal conductivity and tritium inventory of various carbon based materials. The consequences are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Helium is non-corrosive, does not activate, separated easily from tritium, vacuum compatible, and undergoes no phase transformations. Recently, the thermal performance of a bare-copper, dual-channel, helium-cooled, porous metal divertor mock-up, designed and fabricated by Thermacore Inc., was evaluated on Sandia's 30 kW Electron Beam Test System equipped with a closed helium flow loop. The module uses short circumferential flow paths to minimize pressure drops and pumping requirements while achieving optimal thermal performance by providing a very large effective surface area. The module was tested under both uniform and non-uniform heat loads to assess the effects of mass flow instabilities. It survived a maximum absorbed heat flux of 29.5 MW/m(2) on a 2-cm(2) area.

It is submitted to severe operating conditions such as high surface heat flux on the first wall (> 0.5 MW/m(2)) and to very high 14 MeV neutron flux (>10(18) n/m(2) s). Because of the simultaneous requirement of very demanding performances, such as tritium breeding self-sufficiency, high thermal cycle efficiency, high availability and high safety standards, the number of candidate breeding blanket concepts is limited. After recalling advantages and drawbacks of possible combinations of structural materials, coolants, and breeder materials, this paper summarizes the characteristics and the performances of some potential candidate concepts for a European power plant study and associated required R&D.

In the recent blanket designs, helium gas with hydrogen or deuterium is planned to be used as the blanket purge gas to reduce tritium inventory and promote tritium release from the breeding material. In addition, the rate of isotope exchange reaction between hydrogen isotopes in the purge gas and tritium on the surface of the breeding material is necessary to analyze the tritium release behavior from the breeding materials. However, the rate of isotope exchange reactions between hydrogen isotopes in the purge gas and tritium on the surface of those materials has not been quantified until recently. Recently, the present authors quantified the rate of isotope exchange reaction on Li(2)O and Li(2)ZrO(3). The overall mass transfer coefficients representing the isotope exchange reaction between H(2) and D(2)O on breeding materials or the same between D(2) and H(2)O are experimentally obtained in this study. Comparison to isotope exchange reaction rates on various breeding materials is also performed in this study. Discussions about the effects of temperature, concentration of hydrogen in the purge gas or flow rate of the purge gas on the conversion of tritiated water to tritium gas are also performed.

As the maximum allowable temperature of this steel is 550 degreesC, the coolant helium temperature can not exceed 450-500 degreesC, resulting in a relatively low thermal efficiency of the power generation system. The use of a ceramic material like SiCf/SiC with a maximum allowable temperature of 1300 degreesC allows to increase the maximum helium temperatures in the blanket, with the possibility to adopt more efficient power conversion systems. SiCf/SiC provides some other attractive features from the neutronic point of view (low neutron absorber in comparison to EUROFER) and safety (low activation). To take full advantage of the potential of this structural material, a new blanket design has been proposed. The pebble beds have been arranged in parallel to the first wall - by this configuration it was possible to reduce the required amount of beryllium, to improve the tritium breeding ratio and increasing the allowable neutron fluence. Finally, the adopted flow scheme results in a decisive reduction of the coolant pressure drop. On the basis of this design thermo-mechanic, thermo-hydraulic and neutronic calculations have been performed to optimise the design parameters (number and thickness of the beds, Li-6 enrichment, helium temperatures and pressure, etc.). An assessment of the limitation of this concept in term of maximum neutron wall, surface heating, achievable tritium breeding ratio, thermal efficiency in the power conversion system, pumping power for the blanket cooling loops has been performed.

The dual-cooled system has some attractive advantages when utilized in transmutation of HLW (High Level Wastes). The calculation results show that this kind of blanket could safely transmute about 6 ton minor actinides (produced by 170 GW(e) Year PWRs approximately) and 0.4 ton fission products per year, and output 12 GW thermal power. In addition, the variation of power and critical factor of this blanket is relatively little during its 1-year operation period. This blanket is also tritium self-sustainable.

The heat transfer parameters of such a binary pebble bed, namely the thermal conductivity and the heat transfer coefficient to the containing wall, have been investigated previously in the experimental device PEHTRA available at FZK. The experiments measured the effect of the bed temperature and of the constraint exerted by the containing walls. The constraint is defined by the bed interference, i.e. the difference in the radial expansion between bed and the constraining walls related to the bed thickness (Deltal/l). However, with PEHTRA experiments it was only possible to achieve a Deltal/l value of 0.1%. A new experimental rig (SUPER-PEHTRA) has been constructed at FZK, which allows Deltal/l values of 0.3% to be achieved and to measure the pressure of the expanding bed on the containing walls. The present paper reports on the experiments performed with SUPER-PEHTRA for a binary beryllium pebble bed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The blanket has liquid lithium as the tritium breeder and the coolant to alleviate issues of coolant breeder compatibility and reactivity. Vanadium alloy (V-4Cr-4Ti) is used as the structural material because it can accommodate high heat loads. Also, it has good mechanical properties at high temperatures, high neutron fluence capability, low degradation under neutron irradiation, good compatibility with the blanket materials, low decay heat, low waste disposal rating, and adequate strength to accommodate the electromagnetic loads during plasma disruption events. Self-healing electrical insulator (CaO) is utilized to reduce the MHD pressure drop. A poloidal coolant flow with high velocity at the first wall is used to reduce the peak temperature of the vanadium structure and to accommodate high surface heat flux. The blanket has a simple geometrical configuration and low coolant pressure to reduce the fabrication cost, to improve the blanket reliability, and to increase confidence in its performance.

The RF concept of DEMO BTM is based upon the breeder inside tube (BIT)-concept. This concept suggests the use of solid breeding ceramic material, helium as coolant and tritium purge-gas, ferrite-martensite steel as structural material, and beryllium as neutron multiplier. The parameters of the primary circuit coolant are the following, pressure -8 MPa, inlet/outlet temperature - 300/550 degreesC, respectively. Helium (0.1 MPa pressure) is used for tritium removal from ceramic breeder. The ITER water coolant is the secondary circuit coolant of DEMO BTM cooling system. Lithium orthosilicate (Li(4)SiO(4)) is used as tritium breeding material (pebbles-bed of empty set 0.5-1 mm spheres). It is planned to use the beryllium as neutron multiplier (spheres empty set 1 mm pebbles-bed or the porous beryllium). The 3-D neutronic calculations on Monte Carlo method, in accordance with FENDL-1 library of the nuclear data, have been performed for CHC BTM. To validate the CHC BTM concept, the thermal hydraulic analysis has been performed for the design elements and cooling system equipment. The preliminary stress analysis for BTM design elements has been carried out on the ASME-code and RF strength regulations. The four types of LOFA and LOCA accidents have been investigated. The parameters of cooling, coolant purification and tritium extraction systems have been determined. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The key feature of the concept is the use of the heat of vaporization of lithium (about 10 times higher than water) as the primary means for capturing and removing the fusion power. A reasonable range of boiling temperatures of this alkali metal is 1200-1400 degreesC, corresponding with a saturation pressure of 0.035-0.2 MPa. Calculations indicate that an evaporative system with Li at similar or equal to 1200 degreesC can remove a first wall surface heat flux of > 2 MW m(-2) with an accompanying neutron wall load of > 10 MW m(-2). Work to date shows that the system provides adequate tritium breeding and shielding, very high thermal conversion efficiency, and low system pressure. Tungsten is used as the structural material, and it is expected to operate at a surface wall load of 2 MW m(-2) at temperatures above 1200 degreesC. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

However, at lower temperatures, the release process of tritium from the breeders is known to be rather slow. For this reason, there is still a need to develop techniques that promote the release of bred tritium. In order to improve recovery of tritium from blankets over a wide range of temperature, the effect of catalytically active metal additives on the heterogeneous isotope exchange reactions at the breeder/sweep gas interface was examined, and main results are summarized in this paper. Platinum and palladium were deposited on solid breeder material pebbles (Li(4)SiO(4)) by the incipient wet impregnation method. Experiments were performed with hydrogen and predeuterated water using packed bed reactors and gas chromatographic analysis. Out of pile tritium release experiments were also conducted using ceramic breeders irradiated in a research reactor. The experimental results of this work reveal the benefit of the addition of catalytic additive metals, which is very effective to increase the tritium release rate from ceramic breeder materials especially at comparatively lower temperatures.

A localized blanket concept is proposed by selecting molten-salt Flibe as a self-cooling tritium breeder from the main reason of safety: low tritium solubility, low reactivity with air and water, low pressure operation, and low MHD resistance which is compatible with the high magnetic field design in force-free helical reactor (FFHR). Numerical results are presented on nuclear analyses using the MCNP-4B code, on thermal and stress analyses using the ABAQUS code, and heat exchange efficiency from Flibe to He. R&D programs on Flibe engineering are also in progress in material dipping-tests and in construction of molten salt loop. Preliminary results in these experiments are also presented.

Measurements are conducted using a time dependent permeation method over the temperature range 473-723 K, with hydrogen and deuterium driving pressures in the range 1-10(5) Pa (0.01-1000 mbar). The samples are also characterised using optical microscopy, SEM, microhardness measurements and mechanical tests. An effective permeability of about 12 times lower than 2.1 mm of bare F82H steel at 573 K and three times lower than 2.1 mm of bare F82H steel at 723 K have been measured. This result is close to the theoretical prevision (multi-layer model). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Li(2)ZrO(3) (reference) and Li(2)TiO(3) (alternative) have been studied as breeding materials. The total breeder inventory assessed is 7.64 g for the Li(2)ZrO(3) at reference temperature. The model has also been used for a parametric analysis of the tritium permeation. At reference temperature and purge helium velocity of 0.01 m/s, the HT partial pressure is ranging from 10 to 30 Pa in the breeder and 1.5 x 10(-3) Pa in the beryllium. At 0.1 mis of purge helium velocity, the HT partial pressure is reduced of one order by magnitude in the breeder and becomes 5 x 10(-5) Pa in the beryllium. The tritium permeation into the coolant for the whole blanket is ranging from 100 to 250 mCi per day for purge helium velocity of 0.01 mis. The analysis of the tritium inventory and permeation for the alternative Li(2)TiO(3) breeding material has been carried out too;The tritium inventory in the breeder is in the range from 6 to 375 g larger than in Li(2)ZrO(3) by about a factor 5; the tritium permeation into coolant is comparable to the Li(2)ZrO(3) one. This analysis provides indications on the influence of the operating parameters on the tritium control in the ITER breeding blanket; particularly the control of the tritium inventory by the temperature and the tritium permeation by the purge gas velocity.

We completed the preliminary design of a helium-cooled, W-5Re alloy, lithium breeder design and the results are reported in this paper. Many areas of the design were assessed, including material selection, helium impurity control, and mechanical, nuclear and thermal hydraulics design, and waste disposal, tritium and safety design. Systems study results show that at a closed cycle gas turbine (CCGT) gross thermal efficiency of 57.5%, a superconducting coil tokamak reactor, with an aspect ratio of 4, and an output power of 2 GWe, can be projected to have a cost of electricity at 54.6 mill/kW h.

Among the concepts under investigation is the free liquid FW/liquid blanket concept in which a fast flowing liquid FW (similar to 2-3 cm) is followed by thick flowing blanket (B) of similar to 40-50 cm thickness with minimal amount of structure. The liquid FW/B are contained inside the vacuum vessel CW) with a shielding zone (S) located either behind the VV and outside the vacuum boundary (case A) or placed after the FW/B and inside the W (case B). In this paper we investigate the nuclear characteristics of this concept in terms of: (1) attenuation capability of the liquid FW/B/S and protection of the W and magnet against radiation damage; (2) profiles of tritium production rate and tritium breeding ratio (TBR) for several liquid candidates; and (3) profiles of heat deposition rate and power multiplication.

J	Youssef, MZ; Wong, C				Youssef, MZ; Wong, C			Neutronics performance of high-temperature refractory alloy helium-cooled blankets for fusion application	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 19-24, 1999	ROME, ITALY			tritium breeding; helium-cooled refractory metal FW/blanket concept; Li-Sn; Flibe		Among the concepts considered in the advanced power extraction (APEX) study is the helium-cooled refractory metal FW and blanket concept. Refractory metals exhibit high operating temperature and can offer good capability for withstanding high power density operation that is the focus of the APEX study. In this paper, we assess the impact of using various refractory metals on the nuclear heating profiles across the blanket and power multiplication (PM) and on the tritium breeding profiles and tritium breeding ratio (TBR). The refractory metals considered with liquid lithium breeder are W, TZM, and Nb-1Zr. The impact of Li-6 enrichment on these profiles and on TBR and PM is also assessed. Comparison of these nuclear characteristics is also made to other liquid breeder (Flibe and Li-Sn). Because the moderation power of these breeders to neutron energy varies among them, the damage to the structure is different with various structure/breeder combinations. The damage parameters (DPA, helium and hydrogen production) at key locations are also compared with the corresponding values in the thick liquid FW/blanket concept; an innovative design concept under consideration within the APEX study.

This paper resumes the state-of-the-art of the T related technology from the initial T production in the lithium-bearing breeder material to a T stream which is ready for re-injection into the plasma. The remaining development issues are outlined and conventional techniques are confronted with advanced methods requiring more R&D effort but promising certain advantages in return.

An attempt has been made to establish the location of this tritium by measuring components taken from the vessel. A total of 2.0 g of tritium was recovered by out-gassing and 1.5 g was originally estimated for the flakes/deposits from measurement of collected flakes. Measurements on tiles removed from the vessel indicate that all the vessel tiles contain less tritium than expected at similar to0.1 g. Some uncertainty exists about the location of the remaining tritium. Further investigation has shown that a significant quantity of flakes (more than originally estimated) exists in the sub divertor region. It is believed that the missing tritium is present in the flakes in the sub divertor region. However, until this material can be collected and quantified other possible sources cannot be excluded. The reasons for the formation of the flakes/deposits are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The only known drawback of ZrCo is its potential of loosing the ability to reversibly absorb or desorb tritium during prolonged thermal cycling. Under these conditions, the getter hydride ZrCoH(x) (x less than or equal to 3), tends to disproportionate yielding the more stable hydride ZrH(2), which is associated with performance degradation in the gettering properties. In this paper, previous studies on the rate of hydrogen induced disproportionation/reproportionation of ZrCo were extended to a broader temperature range. In addition, comparative measurements were performed with protium and deuterium with the aim of determining possible isotope effect. On the basis of the structural modifications that samples undergo during hydrogenation a qualitative explanation is given for the disproportionation mechanism. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the last 3 years simulated fusion exhaust gases containing 7 g of tritium have been processed with this facility achieving detritiation factors of up to 10(6). New requirements specifying detritiation factors of about 10(8) triggered the addition of a further tritium recovery step to the two already existing process loops. The main component of the third step is the so-called Permcat, a permeator-catalyst combination designed for isotopic swamping in a counter current mode. The upgrade of Caprice to the new system is now called Gaper and involved the replacement of highly contaminated pipe work and the installation of an additional glove box, which houses the new components for the third loop as well as further equipment needed for the continuous operation of Gaper.

As part of a current modification of the Impurity Processing module within the AGHS a Permcat reactor developed at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe will be installed to minimize the amount of tritium discharged to the Exhaust Detritiation System or to the stack. The Permcat's reactor was designed for final clean-up of gases containing up to similar to 1% of tritium in different chemical forms such as water, methane or molecular hydrogen. The unit is based on counter current isotopic swamping with protium, and experiments with laboratory scale Permcat's have shown decontamination factors in the range of 10(4)-10(6) under a variety of conditions. For JET a prototype technical unit was designed to cope with a tritiated gas flow rate of at least 1.5 mol/h. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Phase counterflow in the facility is accomplished through the palladium solid hydride phase motion relative to stationary flow inversion units. The separation column is of a sectional type. It is made up of 12 in-series connected sections of 0.06 m height; nine of them represent a separation zone. The total amount of palladium in the facility is 175.5 g. The facility is operated in a periodic mode with storage vessels for light and heavy components of the separated mixture. During experimental separation of a D-T mix, maximum concentration of the tritium obtained was similar to 96%. The minimum concentration of tritium remaining in the mix was similar to 0.1%. This facility permitted gas processing up to 4.5 mol/day. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
