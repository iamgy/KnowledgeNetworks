J	Maschek, W; Struwe, D				Maschek, W; Struwe, D			Accident analyses and passive measures reducing the consequences of a core-melt in CAPRA/CADRA reactor cores	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								As part of the Combustion Amelioree du Plutonium dans les Reacteurs Avances/Consommation D'Actinides et de Dechets dans les Reacteurs Avances (CAPRA/CADRA) program the feasibility of reactor systems with different neutron spectra and coolants is investigated to burn plutonium and also to destruct minor actinides and long lived fission products. In this paper, we deal with reactor cores with fast spectrum and metal cooling. The design of this type of CAPRA/CADRA cores shows significant differences compared e.g. to conventional fast reactor cores. The high Pu-enrichment and the high minor actinide load have an important influence on the core meltdown behavior and the associated recriticality risk. To cope with this risk, inherent design features and special measures/devices are investigated for their potential of early fuel discharge to reduce the criticality of the reactor core. An assessment of such measures/devices, which could provide an additional line of defense against severe accident development, is given. Within the CAPRA/CADRA program, also accelerator driven subcritical systems are investigated for performing the task of transmutation and incineration. In these fast neutron systems with a strong external neutron source, the kinetic behavior is different to a critical core and new strategies and measures for accident prevention have to be investigated.

Owing to the high-energy resolution and the good capability of event reconstruction it can make a contribution to our understanding of neutrino intensities and their energy spectrum. Moreover. the MSW oscillation probability for sterile and active neutrinos can be well studied because both elastic scattering by electrons and absorption reaction on argon nuclei can be measured independently. Tho main problem in detecting the low-energy neutrino interactions arises from the environmental radioactivity. In the present work we study by Monte Carlo simulation the topology and the rates of the events, induced by neutrinos and background neutrons, in a 470 t (fiducial mass) liquid-argon TPC detector. For neutrino interactions we use the Standard solar model BP98 and the recent experimental confirmation of the shell model computation of absorption cross section. The noise is estimated from new data on natural neutron background, collected in the hall C of the Gran Sasso laboratory, It is confirmed that, with a relatively modest neutron shielding and particular off-line event triggers, the weight of spurious events can be made to have little influence on the ICARUS solar neutrino measurement. Indeed, we expect 6 (26) background events per year in the 212 (759) elastic scattering (absorption reaction) sample. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The nuclei are highly spin polarized by transverse optical pumping of the thermal beam. The installation is ultra-high vacuum (UHV) compatible in a non-UHV accelerator environment. Since the atomic beam is used in a surface science experiment, where contamination must be avoided, special emphasis is given to the vacuum coupling of the accelerator/Li-8 production/surface experimental areas. The atomic beam is produced by stopping the nuclear reaction products and evaporating them again from high-temperature graphite. To enhance the atomic beam, a novel tubular thermalizer is applied.

The method is directly applicable to measurements on radioactive beams. In the conventional experiments, the beam and the Coulomb excited projectiles are stopped in a multi-layered target, while the lighter target nuclei traverse the whole target and are detected around 0 degrees in coincidence with projectile gamma -rays. But even for low intensity radioactive beams, this technique would lead to an excessive accumulation of activity in the target. A method is presented here, in which the beam passes through the target and a hole in the particle detector and is stopped in a downstream beam dump shielded from the detectors.

The experiments were performed with partly burned fuel in two compact and uniform core configurations in the same arrangements as were used in the fresh fuel criticality benchmark experiment performed in 1991. In the experiments, both core configurations contained only 12 wt% U-ZrH fuel with 20% enriched uranium. The first experimental core contained 43 fuel elements with average burnup of 1.22 MWd or 2.8% U-235 burned. The last experimental core configuration was composed of 48 fuel elements with average burnup of 1.15 MWd or 2.6% 235U burned. The experimental determination of k(eff) for both core configurations, one subcritical and one critical, are presented. Burnup for all fuel elements was calculated in two-dimensional four-group diffusion approximation using the TRIGLAV code. The burnup of several fuel elements was measured also by the reactivity method.

Results were compared with the semi-empirical values of Storm and Israel and to the theoretical values of Berger and Hubbell. We also propose a simple function for the attenuation coefficient in the vicinity of the K-edge for uranium and in an extended range of energy for bismuth. The set-up of the source at Ghent is described and the future improvements are explained. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Gelation percent-dose graphs were formed, and 80% of gelation (maximum percentage) has been reached at around 14 kGy dose. To impart metal ion adsorption properties, the hydrogels were amidoximated by the reaction of cyano groups on AN with hydroxylamine in aqueous media. Swelling behaviors of hydrogels were investigated before and after amidoximation. Hydrogels had 54% of swelling originally, this ratio reached 220% of swelling after amidoximation. The degree of amidoximation was followed by FT-IR spectroscopy. The structures of copolymers were analyzed spectroscopically and thermally before and after the amidoximation reaction.

The calibrations for gamma -ray energies below 2754 keV were accomplished with a large number of radioactive sources and above 2754 keV with the C-12(n,gamma) and N-14(n,gamma) reactions. This detector and its efficiency curve were subsequently used to determine accurately the photon emission probabilities of gamma rays from the decays of Co-56 (T-1/2 = 77 d) and Ga-66 (9.5 h) and from the Cl-35(n,gamma) reaction.

The device is based on the detection of secondary electrons emitted following ion impact on a surface. Using a combination of magnetic and electric fields these devices can deliver sub-nanosecond time definition and sub-millimeter position information for ion impact even at incidence rates above 10(6) p/s. When choosing a thin foil for the surface intercepting the heavy ion trajectory, multiple detectors can be used and reliable tracking of heavy ions with moderate energies (greater than or equal to 1 MeV/A) becomes feasible.

It is used for measuring the total energy of alpha particles emitted in air by progenies of Rn-222 (Po-218, Pb-214, and Bi-214), and sometimes by other types of alpha emitters (e.g. Pb-212, U-238 and Pu-239). The purpose of these measurements is to assess the energy delivered by alpha emission from these sources to the lung tissue. A sample (charged progenies attached to aerosols) is collected on filter paper from a known volume of air and placed on the instrument. The discharge rate indicates the alpha energy in MeVl(-1) of air per min that is produced by the alpha emitters. The calibration procedure shows that the instrument has an energy sensitivity for alpha particles of 800.5 MeV/scale unit. The range of the readout scale is 30 units. Measurements of alpha contamination in air were made using this instrument in buildings, private homes and in a standard chamber. The value of the radon concentration in this chamber is traceable back to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

Laboratory and stand tests have been performed, showing that radionuclides can be removed from the bottom residues of nuclear pow er plants to a level below the ASA(sat) according to NRB-96. This treatment decreases the volume of radioactive wastes by approximately a factor of 100. The dried purified bottom residues, which are commercial danger class III wastes, are shipped to storage sites used for industrial wastes. Calculations of the material flows are performed and the sire arrangement of the wastes is given for the bottom residues from the Kursk nuclear power plant. 1 figure, 2 tables, 12 references.

J	Flugge, H; Brejora, S				Flugge, H; Brejora, S			On-site interim stores for spent fuel elements	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								Since June 14 this year, the subject of a nuclear power consensus has been mentioned in the headlines less frequently than in past years. On that day, the government and operators of power plants agreed in Berlin on residual amounts of electricity to be produced and on management of the spent fuel elements of the nineteen German nuclear power plants. One sub-item under the heading of waste management, which continues to arouse debates not only at nuclear power plant sites despite the consensus reached, and which may become vitally important to the operation of plants, will be covered in more detail below: the construction of so-called decentralized interim stores. When present contracts with French and British firms on nuclear fuel reprocessing have been fulfilled and reprocessing has been phased out, these interim stores are to minimize the number of transports within Germany, a notorious source of general unrest, and are supposed to accommodate the spent fuel elements until a suitable repository will have been built where they can then be stored permanently. The whole development of a management concept for spent nuclear fuel in the Federal Republic of Germany, and the requirements to be met by decentralized interim stores, are explained in the article. The resultant standardized concept of dry interim cask storage is outlined in the light of its legal and technical criteria.

Both sintered-product blocks and pebbles are considered in fusion reactor designs. Beryllium evaporated on carbon tiles has also been used in Joint European Torus (JET) and may be considered for other designs. Future efforts are directed toward the pebble form of beryllium. Research and evaluations of data are underway to determine the most attractive material processing approaches in terms of fabrication cost and quality; technical issues associated with heat transfer; thermal, mechanical and irradiation stability; safety and tritium release. Beryllium plasma-facing components will require periodic repair or replacement, therefore disposal or recycling of activated and tritiated beryllinm will also be a concern. Beryllium as a component of the molten salt, Flibe is also being considered in novel approaches to the plasma-structure interface. This paper deals with the main issues related to the use of Be in a fusion reactor as both neutron multiplier and first wall material. These issues include potential reactions with steam during accidents and the health and environmental aspects of its use, reprocessing and reuse, or disposal. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	van der Schaaf, B				van der Schaaf, B			Structural materials requirements for in-vessel components of fusion power plants	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 19-24, 1999	ROME, ITALY			structural materials; in-vessel components; fusion power plants		The economic production of fusion energy is determined by principal choices such as using magnetic plasma confinement or generating inertial fusion energy. The first generation power plants will use deuterium and tritium mixtures as fuel, producing large amounts of highly energetic neutrons resulting in radiation damage in materials. In the far future the advanced fuels, (3)He or (11)B, determine power plant designs with less radiation damage than in the first generation. The first generation power plants design must anticipate radiation damage. Solid sacrificing armour or liquid layers could limit component replacements costs to economic levels. There is more than radiation damage resistance to determine the successful application of structural materials. High endurance against cyclic loading is a prominent requirement, both for magnetic and inertial fusion energy power plants. For high efficiency and compactness of the plant, elevated temperature behaviour should be attractive. Safety and environmental requirements demand that materials have low activation potential and little toxic effects under both normal and accident conditions. The long-term contenders for fusion power plant components near the plasma are materials in the range from innovative steels, such as reduced activation ferritic martensitic steels, to highly advanced ceramic composites based on silicon carbide, and chromium alloys. The steels follow an evolutionary path to basic plant efficiencies. The competition on the energy market in the middle of the next century might necessitate the riskier but more rewarding development of SiCSiC composites or chromium alloys.

Some USA SIBELIUS experimental data were released and provided useful input data for tritium transport models and code development. An analysis of these USA SIBELIUS experimental data was performed in this paper. A comparison of the tritium kinetics results predicted by the model with those from the experiments shows reasonable agreements. In addition, a parametric sensitivity analysis for the variance of surface activation energies and diffusion coefficient is performed and the minimal effects are observed based on the modeling results.

It is shown that thermal treatment decreases hydrogen permeability in 10Cr12Mn20W steel and increases it in 10Cr9WVA steel. Hydrogen flux in 10Cr9WVA ferritic/martensitic steel increases due to hydrogen decarbonization, this agrees with electrical and magnetic property changes under hydrogen treatment. Permeability of tritium through the analyzed steels is estimated and compared with the values for 2.25Cr-1Mo, 9Cr-1Mo and 316 steels. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Alumina seems to be a promising coating material. However, an appropriate coating system must also have the potential for self-healing since the ceramic alumina scale tends to fail if mechanical stress is applied. A technology is introduced to form a ductile Al enriched surface scale on F82K-mod steel (Fe-7.7% Cr) and on top of it alumina. This technology consists of two main process steps. Hot dip aluminising has been performed at 700 degreesC for 30 s to the steel in order to introduce AI to the surface near zone by an easy way. The very hard intermetallic scale Fe,AI, which forms during the immersion process gets completely transformed into FeAl(2), FeAl and alpha -Fe(Al) phases during a subsequent HIP process step at high pressure at 1040 degreesC and 30 min. The pressure chosen for the HIP experiment was 3000 bar. Compared to a heat treatment without superimposed high pressure pores formation due to the Kirkendall effect could be suppressed successfully. The influence of the high pressure on the heat treatment (1040 degreesC, 30 min) will be discussed in this paper. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Infrared spectra in Li(2)O single crystals which were treated by thermal absorption and consequent quenching were observed from room temperature to 773 K. Multiple peaks were observed in the O-D stretching vibration region and these peaks had different dependence on temperature. These peaks were attributed to the stretching vibrations of O-D presenting as LiOD or Li(2)O-D(+) in bulk Li(2)O with or without defects. Above 623 K, most of the deuterium ions in Li(2)O exist as Li(2)O-D(+) and the infrared absorption peak for them was observed around 2520 cm(-1). The absorbance decrease of this peak during the isothermal annealing was well analysed by a diffusion model. Diffusion behaviour of hydrogen isotopes in Li(2)O was discussed from the in-situ observation of O-D. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The model considers not only stress assisted diffusion tin which hydrogen transport is driven by the hydrostatic stress field) but also stress-and-strain assisted diffusion where both the hydrostatic stress and the plastic strain fields play relevant roles, thus accounting for the presence of residual stresses generated by metal working, or mechanical pre-damage in the form of cumulative plastic strain, hydrogen traps (dislocations and others) etc. The equations of stress-and-strain assisted diffusion are derived from physical and thermodynamical bases. The model is very useful to evaluate the hydrogen transport by diffusion towards the potential fracture places. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The prevailing environmental conditions, principally nuclear radiation, tritium exposure, magnetic fields, and the need for containment, have a significant impact on the design and selection of equipment. This paper presents the design of the Reduced Technical Objectives/Reduced Cost (RTO/RC) ITER primary pumping system with particular emphasis on the nuclear aspects of the design. Component selection and equipment layout issues to meet established requirements for the system are reviewed together with the R&D that is being undertaken to support the design. In addition, serviceability and maintainability issues related to this system are also discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Since gas density varies inversely with temperature, a pump delivers much higher mass flow rate at low temperature than at room temperature for a given size. Advantages of this concept are reduction in size and weight, when compared with a conventional pump scaled for the same mass flow rate at room temperature. The inlet gas temperature is set in order to avoid condensation on the rotor blades and surroundings. A temperature gradient between the different pumping stages allows optimization of the exhaust pressure. This pump should be a solution for continuous tritium extraction and minimization of the mass inventory for fusion tokamaks fuel cycle control. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The main goals of the study are aimed at establishing physics and engineering basis and limitations of the reactor. It was assumed that DEMO is a next step after international thermonuclear experimental reactors (ITER) operation, and so conservative assumptions were used in the study based on ITER engineering. A steady state operation mode is recommended with fusion power of 2-3 GW and maximum first wall (FW) neutron load of 3-4 MW m(-2). The reactor has to operate in advance plasma mode with high fraction of bootstrap current. The reversed shear regime and operation in H-mode are evaluated. A lifetime of 30-40 MW m(-2) is assumed for the DEMO plant, with three to four changes of plasma facing components. The general reactor layout is determined. Two options of breeding blanket with ceramic and liquid lithium breeders are presented, supported by neutronic, thermalhydraulic and mechanical calculations. A conventional type of water or Li cooling divertor targets with maximum heat load of similar to 10 MW m(-2) was chosen. Heat to electricity conversion schemes are analysed for both helium and liquid metal coolant with net efficiency of 35-40%. Aspects of radioactive waste management are considered.

The ST also offers stability at high elongation which permits operation at high bootstrap current fraction leaving only a modest external current drive requirement. Results from START indicate the ST has resilience to disruptions and low halo currents when disruptions are triggered. In order to explore these potential advantages, a conceptual design of a steady-state ST power plant is being developed for which the thermodynamic, neutronic and mechanical design of the plant have been iterated, together with the plasma parameters, to give a consistent design. The baseline design uses water cooled copper for the centre rod and return limbs of the toroidal held (TF) coils with minimal steel shielding around the rod giving a simple coil design. A helium cooled ceramic pebble bed blanket with beryllium multiplier is used to generate the required tritium and achieve a high thermal efficiency. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

IFMIF would also provide calibration and validation of data from fission reactor and other accelerator based irradiation tests. This paper describes the activity on neutron/gamma dosimetry (necessary for the characterization of the specimens' irradiation) performed in the frame of the IFMIF conceptual design evaluation (CDE) neutronics tasks. During the previous phase (conceptual design activity (CDA)) the multifoil activation method was proposed for the measurement of the neutron fluence and spectrum and a set of suitable foils was defined. The cross section variances and covariances of this set of foils have now been used for tests on the sensitivity of the IFMIF neutron spectrum determination to cross section uncertainties. The analysis has been carried out using the LSL-M2 code, which optimizes the neutron spectrum by means of a least-squares technique taking into account the variance and covariance files. In the second part of the activity, the possibility of extending to IFMIF the use of existing on-line in-core neutron/gamma monitors (to be located at several positions inside the IFMIF test cell, for beam control, safety and diagnostic purposes) has been studied. A feasibility analysis of the modifications required to adapt sub-miniature fission chambers (recently developed by CEA-Cadarache) to the high flux test module of the test cell has been carried out. The verification of this application pertinence and a gross definition of the in-core detector characteristics are described. The option of using self-powered neutron detectors (SPNDs) is also discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The designs have to satisfy stringent requirements for tritium confinement, nuclear shielding and vacuum integrity. This paper introduces the requirements for diagnostics in the ITER long pulse, burning plasma environment, and addresses the impact of the reactor environment on the diagnostics and ancillary equipment. These systems necessarily require access to the plasma or first wall, which generally conflicts with the requirements of the basic machine. Holes are required through the first wall, primary shielding, containment boundaries and biological shielding. Components have a limited life and require maintenance. This paper describes the effect of the radiation environment on diagnostic design at different locations. Ex-vessel and in-vessel remote handling, hot cell refurbishment and tritium confinement are also described. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Flowing liquid metal Li inside the replaceable tube made of low activation materials (alloy, stainless steel etc.) coated by SiC is used as the medium carrying toroidal field coil current and removing Ohmic heat and nuclear heat in the center conductor post. The calculation and analysis have shown that the novel concept has potentially attractive advantages mainly including less transmutation wastes, no electric conductivity change, tolerable neutron structure damage, enhancement in tritium breeding ratio and longer service time in comparison with the conventional concept based on copper alloy conductor. The possible engineering and technological problems are specified for further study. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

These features support the intrinsic safety characteristics of fusion. The most important safety function is the confinement of radioactivity. The first barrier is based on the vacuum Vessel (VV) and its extensions. A pressure suppression system limits the maximum pressure of the VV in the event of loss of coolant. The second barrier is the Cryostat and its extensions. Outward leakage from the second confinement can be captured in surrounding rooms where necessary. Open penetrations of the VV will be protected by at least two separate barriers such as windows or valves. Nuclear decay heat will be removed passively by the VV cooling system. Other safety systems have been identified which play an important role for both ITER and a fusion power reactor. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The main results obtained up to early 1997 were reported at ISFNT-4. The newest findings will be presented in this paper. Comparison will be made with findings from fusion power plant studies performed outside the EU, i.e. ARIES-RS (US) and DREAM (JA). Important lessons learnt from the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor Engineering Design Activities (ITER EDA) will also be presented. Emphasis will be put on how the two leading success criteria 'no-evacuation of the public for any in-plant accident' and 'no radioactive waste burden for future generations' can be met and how these criteria fit with the fundamental safety objectives of the recently presented European utilities requirements for LWR nuclear power plants.

However, the environmental impact of waste material is determined not only by the level of activation, but also the total Volume of activated material. Since a tokamak power plant is large, the potential to generate a correspondingly large volume of activated material exists. The adoption of low activation materials, while important for reducing the radiotoxicity of the most active components, should be done as part of a strategy that also minimizes the volume of waste material that might be categorized as radioactive, even if lower in level. In this paper we examine different fusion blanket and shield designs in terms of their ability to limit the activation of the large vessel/ex-vessel components (e.g. vacuum vessel, magnets) and we identify the trends that allow improved in-vessel shielding to result in reduced vessel/ex-vessel activation. Recycling and clearance are options for reducing the volume of radioactive waste in a fusion power plant. Thus, the performance of typical fusion power plant designs with respect to recycling and clearance criteria are also assessed, to show the potential for improvement in waste volume reduction by careful selection of materials' combinations. We discuss the impact of these results on fusion waste strategies and on the development of fusion power in the future. (C) Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Full sector removal through horizontal ports for easy maintenance is adopted in order to increase availability. Cask type sector removal machines are used to transfer the blanket/divertor sectors. Achievable availability is estimated with a maintenance period and its interval. The proposed maintenance approach allows, at least, the similar availability to that of the present nuclear plants. The estimated availability is acceptable from an economical viewpoint. Safety concerns related to the super-heated direct steam cycle are also examined. One of the unique concerns is due to nitrogen-16 production in the coolant. The super-heated steam must how through the turbines within several 10 s after leaving the blanket. The requirements for shielding on the heat transfer systems are declared. Another concern is the confinement and recovery of tritium in the coolant, because a high temperature blanket may have a large tritium permeation rate. Water detritiation system proposed here would be able to control the tritium concentration in the coolant within an allowable range. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Particulate less than 10 mum in size is easily mobilized both during an accident as well as during routine maintenance activities. We have collected and analyzed dust samples from three tokamaks to determine the potential contribution to accident source terms in future fusion power plants. We have obtained dust samples from Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory's TFTR (prior to the final run period in 1997), from MIT's Alcator C-Mod (during March and April of 1998), and from General Atomics' DIII-D (August of 1998). This paper presents the results of our analyses for particle size distribution, specific surface area, and dust composition, including the tritium content of TFTR dust.

SEAFP strategy for the management of activated material is here applied to international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER). This strategy aims to reduce the amount of radioactive waste by conditional recycling (re-use of the activated material) in novel fusion plants and by clearance (declassification of the material with low activity level to non-active waste). Limits on the surface dose rates of the activated material after an interim storage of 50 years are proposed here to define the suitable recycling procedures. The possibility of clearance is assessed from limits on the specific activity of the material. These limits take into account the relative hazard of the various radionuclides contained in the material. It is shown that the amount of permanent radwaste arising from ITER may be substantially reduced to 0. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Using an activation calculation code FDKR and its associated data library AF-DCDLIB to calculate the radioactivity, decay heat, waste disposal rating and biological hazard potential from activation products, actinides and fission products in the FEB-E. The codes and libraries used in calculation are introduced briefly, and calculation results and decay curves of related hazards after the shutdown of one-year operation of the FEB-E are given. The activation features of five candidate structural materials were also evaluated for FEB-E design. Detailed calculation and analyses of waste disposal rating and remote maintenance rating for all long-lived radionuclides were performed to identify the safety, environmental and radioactive waste characteristics of the FEB-E design. Results obtained show that the total radioactivity inventory, decay heat and BHP at shutdown are 5.74 x 10(13) MBq, 8.34 MW and 4.08 x 10(8) km(3) of air for 316SS structure material, respectively. The inventory of actinides important for the fuel reprocessing, such as (232)U and (237)Np was also investigated. It was shown that their low concentrations in FEB-E appear to be manageable.

The Caisson is a stainless steel leak-tight vessel of 12 m(3), simulating a reactor room or a tritium handling room. In the first stage experiments, about 260 MBq of pure tritium was put into the Caisson under simulated constant Ventilation of four times air exchanges per h. The tritium mixing and migration in the Caisson was investigated with tritium contamination measurement and detritiation behavior measurement. The experimental tritium migration and removal behavior was almost perfectly reproduced and could almost be simulated by a three-dimensional flow analysis code. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

A design revision of the ignitor project lead to the substitution of the graphite tiles with molybdenum ones. The consequences of this substitution from the radiological risk and environmental impact viewpoints are examined, applying a computational model for tritium inventory estimate and for activation calculation. It turns out that the global tritium inventory in the machine is almost halved by this design modification, due to a practically negligible tritium inventory in Mo. Activation of Mo is higher that that of C, however, it remains moderate. Because of this, some of the most relevant accidental sequences see a reduction of releases and of doses to public, due to radioactive source terms reduction. Graphite substitution with Mo in the first wall has therefore a global positive effect on the machine radiological safety. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

From the neutronics point of view, after a first period of machine set up and tuning in aneutronic operation, a second phase of 2.5 MeV neutron production with pure deuterium plasmas at increasing density is anticipated. After that, a transition phase to increasing percentage of tritium will be followed by several years of operations with 50% of tritium leading to short but intense 14-MeV neutron emission. To deal with the concerns due to the strong neutron emission, a detailed description of the actual Ignitor machine is implemented in the MCNP-4B Monte Carlo code to calculate the neutron fluxes in all machine components, taking in account the streaming through the ports. These fluxes are then used as input for the FISPACT-97 code for the analysis of the activation at the end of life and at intermediate times for safety assessment purposes. The resulting dose rate outside the device is also studied. The results point out that remote handling is needed for repair/maintenance of inner components following the DD operations, and that the access in the hall near the device could be restricted from the beginning of DT operations. The requirements on additional shield are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A study has been initiated to determine a detritiation process drawing on a melting process currently used on a semi-industrial scale at the CEA/DAM (Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique/Direction des Applications Militaires). The first part of the project consists in characterizing these ingots. The measurements performed at the CNRS ORSAY (Centre National de Recherche Scientifique), permit to assess, by autoradiography, tritium distribution in two directions (longitudinal and transverse) and to measure tritium desorption using an original beta counting device. The second part of the project should allow us to assess the possibility of improving the process in terms of detritiation rates using bubbling argon and hydrogen during melting to improve mixing, and thus facilitate the removal of tritium.

Helium cooled ceramics Li(4)SiO(4) breeding blanket option was considered. The consideration is based on European waste forth-levels (NAW, LLW, MLW, and HLW) classification, which is adopted by IAEA. Ultimate aim of waste management is hands-on recycling for major part of reactor materials. For this goal low activation materials is proposed with limiting contents of long-term impurities. RF Sanitary Rules of Radioactive Waste Management (SRRWM-85) and US NRC rules 10CFR61 were considered.

Samples of the stainless steel 316 (AISI 316 LN (IG)), which is the structural material of international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER), of the low-activation steels MANET and F82H and of the vanadium alloys V-3Ti-1Si, V-4Ti-4Cr and V-5Ti-2Cr were used for benchmarks. Pieces having the mass of approximate to1 g were irradiated at the high-intensity neutron generator SNEG-13 at Sergiev Posad with neutrons of 14.93 and 14.37 MeV mean energy. Fluences applied were of the order of 10(14) cm(-2). gamma -Spectra of the samples were measured several times during the decay up to about I-year. The activities of 27 different radionuclides, identified by gamma -energies and half-life, were determined. Their half-lives range from a few min up to 5.3 years. For each of the measured values the activity was calculated with EASY-97, and calculated-to-experimental values (CIE) were determined. If the uncertainty of the CIE is estimated with both the experimental errors and the calculational one, including cross-section as well as half-life uncertainties, validation of EASY-97 can be stated for most of the activities. The pathways of production are analysed for all activities, and the corresponding cross-sections are discussed if larger deviations were observed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Benoit, P; De Raedt, C; Decreton, M				Benoit, P; De Raedt, C; Decreton, M			Design of an in-pile device for testing of WCLL double wall tubes	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 19-24, 1999	ROME, ITALY			double-wall tubes (DWT); tritium permeation barrier (TPB); water cooled lithium lead (WCLL)		The present paper describes irradiation devices proposed by SCK CEN to test segments of water cooled lithium-lead blankets (WCLL), and in particular their double-wall tubes (DWT), under irradiation in the BR2 reactor. The purpose of the first experiment is to assess the efficiency of a tritium permeation barrier (TPB) coating at the outer surface of the DWT. Hence, two DWT segments are plunged in a lithium-lead pool. The inside of the DWT is flushed by helium and collects the tritium permeating through the wall. One of the DWTs has received a TPB coating, the other not, so that comparative measurements are possible. For the second experiment, a DWT segment is heated by the gamma flux of BR2 and cooled at the inside by pressurised water. Hence, the temperature gradient tends to separate the two tubes. The purpose is to verify how the brazing agent performs at doses up to 3 dpa. The irradiation device is installed inside the central hole of a BR2 fuel element, in order to maximise the fast neutron component of the flux received by the target. As an attractive alternative, the utilisation of the PWR loop Callisto is also proposed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
