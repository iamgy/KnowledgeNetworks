J	Su, SI; Yim, MS				Su, SI; Yim, MS			Analysis of radionuclide release from spent ion-exchange resins	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							KINETICS	Ion-exchange resins represent one of the most important waste streams in low-level waste management due to the unstabilized nature of the waste form and the large amount of radioactivity contained. To describe the release of radionuclides from ion-exchange resins stored in a disposal facility, a mechanistic release model was developed. The model is based on description of radionuclide migration both in the resin bead phase and the bulk pore water phase within waste containers. This modeling setup provides the capability to describe all the major physical processes taking place for the release of radionuclides. Because of the difficulty in obtaining analytical solutions, the numerical solution approach was employed in this model. The new resin release model was used to examine key processes and parameters in describing radionuclide release. These were found to be diffusion within the bulk pore water phase, flow rate of infiltrating leachant water, concentration of counterions of the leachant water, and sorption during the transport in the bulk pore water phase. Some parameters were found to have little impact in describing the release. These include the interdiffusion coefficient within resin beads and the density and radius of resin beads. Existing simplified modeling approaches were also compared with the new resin release model, and validities of using these simplified models are discussed.

J	Bell, JT				Bell, JT			Alternatives to high-level waste vitrification: The need for common sense	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								The competition for government funding for remediaton of defense wastes (and for other legitimate government functions) is intensifying as the United States moves toward a balanced national budget. Determining waste remediation priorities for the use of available tax dollars will likely depend on established international agreements and on the real risks posed to human health. Remediation of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) high-level radioactive tank wastes has been described as the most important priority in the DOE system. The proposed tank waste remediation at three DOE sites will include retrieval of the wastes from the aging storage tanks, immobilization of the wastes, and safe disposal of the processed waste. Vitrification, the current immobilization technology chosen by DOE, is very costly. The U.S. Congress and the American people may not be aware that the present cost of preparing just 1 m(3) of processed waste product at the Savannah River Site is similar to$2 million! In a smaller waste remediation project at the West Valley Site, similar waste treatment is costing >$2 million/m(3) of waste product. Privatization efforts at the Hanford Site are now estimated to cost >$4 million/m(3) of waste product. Even at the lowest current cost of $2 million/m(3) of HLW glass product, the total estimated costs for remediating the tank wastes at the three DOE sites of Savannah River, Hanford, and Idaho Falls is $75 billion. Whether our nation can afford treatment costs of this magnitude and whether Congress will be willing to appropriate these huge sums for waste vitrification when alternative technologies can provide safe disposal at considerably lower cost are questions that need to be addressed The hazard levels posed by the DOE tank wastes do not warrant high priority in comparison to the hazards of other defense wastes. Unless DOE selects a lower-cost technology for tank waste remediation, such efforts are likely to continue in a holding pattern, with little actually accomplished. In many cases, selection of a lower-cost technology such as "dry and package" could safely accomplish the needed waste remediation while reducing both the time required and the remediation costs by as much as a factor of 10. Failure to implement realistic cost-saving waste disposal policies could result in congressional action to deny funding for the DOES continued remediation of radioactive tank wastes.

J	Triplett, CE; Canaan, RE; Klein, DE				Triplett, CE; Canaan, RE; Klein, DE			A comparison of natural convection heat transfer for a staggered versus an aligned array of horizontal spent nuclear fuel rods within a rectangular enclosure	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							ASSEMBLIES	Natural convection heat transfer was experimentally investigated in a staggered array of heated cylinders, oriented horizontally within a rectangular isothermal enclosure. The test conditions were characteristic of a spent-fuel assembly during transport or horizontal dry storage. The assembly was configured with a pitch-to-diameter ratio of 1.33 and backfilled with pressurized helium or nitrogen. The backfill pressure was varied between 1 and 5 atm, while the assembly power was varied between 1 and 5 W per heater rod. The resulting data are presented in the form of Nusselt-Rayleigh number correlations, where the Nusselt number has been corrected fro thermal radiation using a numerical technique. The staggered-array data are compared to pervious data for a similar-pitch aligned rod array (a simulated boiling water reactor fuel assembly) to determine if convective heat transfer is enhanced or hindered in a staggered configuration. For the overall array, both the staggered and aligned configurations yield Nusselt-Rayleigh curves with a three-regime trend, which suggests distinct conduction and convection regimes separated by a transition regime. For lower Rayleigh number (<10(6)), representative of the conduction regime, the aligned-array Nusselt number is 10 to 12% higher than the corresponding staggered-array value. However, in the convection regime at higher Rayleigh numbers, the staggered-array Nusselt number slightly exceeds the aligned-array Nusselt number. This is attributed to the fact that the staggered array begins to transition into the convection regime at lower Rayleigh number than the aligned array. For both configurations, the slope of the Nusselt-Rayleigh curve in the convection regime suggests turbulent flow conditions.

J	Choi, SH; Nho, YC				Choi, SH; Nho, YC			Radiation-induced graft copolymerization of binary monomer mixture containing acrylonitrile onto polyethylene films	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article							GROUP-CONTAINING ADSORBENT; AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; URANIUM; RECOVERY; SEAWATER; ADSORPTION; ACID; IONS	Graft copolymerization of acrylonitrile (AN)/acrylic acid (AA), acrylonitrile (AN)/methacrylic acid (MA), and acrylonitrile (AN)/glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) onto pre-irradiated polyethylene (PE) films were studied. The effect of reaction conditions such as solvents, additives, and monomer composition on the grafting yields was investigated. The extent of grafting was found to increase with increasing sulfuric acid concentration when sulfuric acid as an additive was added to the grafting solution. In AN/AA mixture: the proportion of acrylonitrile in the copolymer increased with an increasing AN component in feed monomers. On the other hand, in AN/MA mixture, acrylonitrile component in copolymer was very slight in spite of the increase AN component in feed monomers. In the AN/GMA mixture, the proportion of acrylonitrile in the copolymer increased with increasing acrylonitrile component in AN/GMA feed monomer. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Neutronic performances of the deuterium-tritium (D-T) driven hybrid blankets, fuelled with UN, UC, UO2 and U3Si2, in four different cases, are investigated under first wall load of the 5 MW/m(2.) The fissile fuel zone considered to be cooled with four coolants: air, flibe (Li2BeF4), natural lithium and eutectic lithium (Li17Pb83) With volume fraction ratio of 29.5, 45.5 and 62.56%. The behaviour of the fuels mentioned above are observed during 48 months for discrete time intervals of Delta t = 15 days and by a plant factor (PF) of 75%. At the end of the operation time, calculations have shown that cumulative fissile fuel enrichment (CFFE) values have varied between 3.80 and 8.1% depending on the fuel, volume fraction and coolant type. The best enrichment performance is obtained in flibe (Li2BeF4) coolant blankets, followed by Eutectic lithium (Li17Pb83), air whereas natural lithium coolant shows a poor rejuvenation performance in all fuels. CFFE reach maximum value (8.1%) in UO2 fuelled blanket (in Row #1) and Li2BeF4 coolant that volume fraction is 62.5% after 48 months. The lowest CFFE value (3.80%) is in U3Si2 fuelled blanket (in Rows #6 and 7) and natural lithium coolant that volume fraction is 62.56% at the end of the operation period.The enrichment would be sufficient for LWR reactor. The best tritium breeding ratio (TBR) is obtained in U3Si2 fuelled blanket with natural lithium coolant, and followed by UC, UO2. UN with the same coolant. At the beginning of the operation, TBR values were 1.459, 1.502 and 1.554 in U3Si2 fuelled blanket with natural Lithium coolant 1.414, 1.474 and 1.547 in UC fuelled blanket with natural lithium coolant for volume fraction of 29.5, 45.5 and 62.56%, respectively. At the end of the operation, TBR reach 1.511. 1.559 and 1.613 in U3Si2 fuelled blanket and 1.467, 1.532 and 1.609 in UC fuelled blanket for volume fraction of 29.5, 45.5 and 62.56%, respectively. TBR values are higher than unity. Therefore, investigated hybrid blanket is self-sufficient for all fuel mixture and coolants. The isotopic percentage of Pu-240 is higher than 5% in all modes with flibe coolant, so that the plutonium component in these modes can never reach a nuclear weapon grade quality during the operation period. This is a very important safety factor. The isotopic percentage of Pu-240 is lower than 5% in all blanket with air, natural lithium, and eutectic lithium coolant. In these modes, operation period must be increased for safety. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Malkawi, SR; Ahmad, N				Malkawi, SR; Ahmad, N			Prediction and measurement of neutron energy spectrum in a material test research reactor	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								The objective of this work is to calculate and measure the neutron energy spectrum in the Pakistan Research Reactor-1 (PARR-1), which is a typical Material Test Reactor (MTR) fueled with low enriched uranium. The method of multiple foil activation was used with the adjustment code MSITER, a modified version of the code STAY'SL, to obtain the experimentally measured spectrum. The calculated spectrum, which was used as pre-information in the adjustment procedure, was obtained through modeling the core and its surroundings in three-dimensions and the use of the transport code WIMS-D/4 and the diffusion code CITATION. A comparison between the calculated and measured spectra shows that the ratio of measured to calculated flux density in the thermal region (E less than or equal to 0.5 eV) is 0.998. This ratio is 1.02 for resonance (1/E) region (0.5 eV < E less than or equal to 0.5 MeV) and 0.932 for the fast region (E > 0.5 MeV). This result is compared with other published results that report an agreement within 10 to 30% between the calculated and measured spectra. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kim, SJ; Cho, NZ; Kim, YJ				Kim, SJ; Cho, NZ; Kim, YJ			A pan-shape transuranic burner core with a low sodium void worth	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								A 1575 MWt transuranic (TRU) burner reactor core with a low sodium void worth has been developed by devising a pan-shaped active core design. The core consists of two types of fule subassemblies that differ in the height of the fueled regions. This strategy has allowed an extreme "pancaking" of the inner core region, while the radial dimension increase is limited by placing longer Fuels in the outer core region. The fuel cycle analysis has been performed in the equilibrium cycle, consisting of external feed fuel with reprocessed typical PWR spent fuel and fissile makeup with recycled TRU elements. The neutronic performance characteristics obtained from the equilibrium cycle analysis show that it would work safely as well as economically, as measured in terms of burnup reactivity swing, peak power density, Doppler coefficient, TRU burning and sodium void worth. The core has relatively low double power peaks in both the inner and outer cores without enrichment zoning, and this enables to make an active core volume smaller. The developed TRU burner core has been subjected to an extensive parametric study on the reprocessing schemes. investigations are given for sodium void worth, transmutation capability, burnup reactivity swing and minor actinide (MA) contents. Through this series of study, a variant of the TRU burner core that is aimed at preferentially burning MA has been determined. This MA burner core uses U-235 as well as the homogeneously recycled TRU elements. This MA burner core consumes 140 kg of MA per year, without penalizing the sodium void reactivity observed in the TRU burner core. Finally, the combined introduction of developed TRU and MA burner cores shows the functional effectiveness of reducing PWR discharged TRU inventory. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This depends on the composition of the fuel and on the irradiation conditions. Previously, the insertion in PWR of fuels coming from alternative reprocessing techniques has been proposed and many studies have been developed to evaluate their neutronic viability. This article tries to analyse the waste generated by these fuels, when submitted to the same irradiation conditions. To reprocess the fuels, alternative techniques were used. Coprocessing and AIROX Multirecycles will be simulated and the effects of the insertion of Thorium in the composition of these reprocessed fuels will be studied. In comparison, the standard fuel used, UO2, was also simulated. The goal of this study is to verify the radiological risk associated with the simulated fuels, relating the fuel inventory to its radiotoxicity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The responsibility for establishing a procedure to achieve this lies with the International Committee of Weights and Measures (CIPM) and its associated Consultative Committees. In pursuit of these ends, a series of general recommendations and procedures have been developed by BIPM in order to achieve these objectives. Central to these recommendations is the concept of Key Comparisons which involve a series of comparison exercises both within and between the regional metrology organizations, such as EUROMET, NORAMET and APMP. Because of the unique nature of radioactivity standardization, this generalized procedure is. for practical purposes, impossible to apply in the field of radionuclide metrology. The remedy has been the development of a protocol which optimizes both the current effort available within existing National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) and the considerable amount of data from previous intercomparisons. This paper details this novel approach, provides practical examples, discusses potential problems and examines the way in which the programme will continue and expand.

A bolometer with a 10 mu g tin absorber has been developed at IAS (Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale) and has been tested in the cryogenic installation of LPRI; an energy resolution (full width half maximum, FWHM) of 39 eV has been obtained on the K alpha line of Mn. Besides these good spectrometry results, an absolute activity measurement using bolometers is proposed by adapting an absorber geometry for 4 pi counting. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

These radionuclides are present in the environment due to the reactions between the galactic cosmic rays and the earth's surface, and in nuclear power plants by the activation of the structural components of nuclear reactor vessels. The aim of this paper is to propose a radiochemical separation method of Ca-41 and Ca-45 from the other beta-gamma emitters present in radioactive materials, based on selective precipitation reactions. The activities were measured by liquid scintillation counting (LSC). The obtained decontamination factors are satisfactory for each radioactive component of the initial sample in that their activities in the final product were lower than the minimum detectable activity (MDA) due to the effectiveness of the radiochemical procedure. The sensitivity of the method allows the radiological characterization of Ca-41 and Ca-45 content in radioactive materials. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Extrapolation curves were obtained at three gamma gates of 1099.2 keV, 1291.6 keV, and that covering both photo-peaks by a computer discrimination method. Of these extrapolation curves, only that obtained at (950-1350) keV gamma gate shows a linear variation, but those of two single gamma gates are not linearly varied in the high efficiency region, This nonlinearity obtained at the gamma gate of 1099.2 keV photo-peak was caused by the correlation effects due to 1-3 coincidence relation via unobserved 192 keV gamma-ray transitions.

The purpose of the module presented here. called MTR2 (Module de Temps-mort Reconductible), is to process, in terms of pulse height discrimination and dead-time corrections, the pulses delivered by the detectors used in counting systems. This dead-time, of the extendible type, is triggered by both the positive and negative parts of the incoming pulse and the dead-time corrections are made according to the live-time method. This module, which has been developed and tested at LPRI, can be used alone in simple counting channels or in more complex systems such as coincidence systems. The philosophy governing the choice and the implementation of this type of dead-time as well as the system used for the dead-time corrections is presented. The electronic scheme and the performances are also presented. This module is available in the NIM standard. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

To solve the chemical problems,a sample composition involving the Ultima Gold(TM) AB scintillator and a high concentration of HCl is used. Standardization by the CIEMAT/NIST method and by pulse shape discrimination is described. The results agree within 0.1% with those obtained by two other methods. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The first method, 4 pi liquid scintillation (LS), consisted of the extrapolation of the 4 pi counting rate to the zero discrimination level. A home-made, single channel instrument and a commercial Packard INSTA-GEL scintillator were used. The radioactivity concentration on the reference date 1 April 1997 was 63.1 +/- 1.3 kBq g(-1) The second method was the efficiency tracer technique, using a Co-60 Standard solution; the radioactivity concentration was calculated as the mean of several extrapolated values of the curve Nbeta Tl-204 = N(0Tl-204)f(1 - epsilon(beta Co-60)) The preliminary reported value was 62.8 +/- 0.8 kBq g(-1); the revised value is 61.8 +/- 1.2 kBq g(-1), in good agreement with other 4 pi (p.c.) tracer results in the comparison. Some remarks are made regarding our measurements and the comparison results. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim of this exercise was to test the different methods and more particularly X- and gamma-ray spectrometry methods used in the determination of uranium enrichment. Sets of samples of different uranium enrichments prepared by IRMM (Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements) and BNFL (British Nuclear Fuels) were measured by 15 participants in the IRMM laboratories, A description of this exercise is given here and the final results with their uncertainties are compared to the reference values obtained from mass spectrometry measurements. The main conclusions from this exercise are proposed; in particular, it appears necessary to improve the nuclear data used in the spectral modeling of the XKalpha region.

The massic activity ratios of all of the available NBS/NIST tritiated water SRMs and samples of the Level 1 and Level 3 tritiated water standards produced by the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in 1996 were measured using an extensive series of liquid-scintillation intercomparisons. New massic activity values obtained for the NPL standards, using the gas counting results for SRM 4927E and the results of the liquid-scintillation intercomparison, are also reported. A new determination of the half-life of tritium was made using massic activity data for SRM 4927 over a period of 38 years. The new value is (4504 +/- 9) (one standard deviation) days. This value differs significantly from the previous NBS/NIST value but is in good agreement with the value recommended in the Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data File (ENSDF).

The method combines measurements and calculations. In the experimental part, the energy spectrum of the source is measured by means of an alpha spectrometer. The energy spectrum is then modelled by the Monte Carlo method, taking into account energy loss of alpha particles in the source matrix, energy-loss straggling and the parameters of the spectrometer. Additional parameters for the characterization of reference sources are derived from the integral of the depth distribution. The investigations prove that the production process of commercial sources can be controlled in such a way that more than 90% of the radioactive material is implanted in the top layer of 5 mu m thickness of an aluminum foil.

These characteristics are very suitable for gamma-ray calibration sources, therefore, the absolute activity of Ho-166m was measured and several sealed sources were produced to be used as reference sources for the secondary standardization systems for gamma-ray emitting nuclides. In this project, seven metal sealed sources and ten point sources were produced and several of these sources were transferred to the secondary standard laboratories to complete the traceability scheme.

No direct measurements of alpha-particle emission probabilities (P-alpha) of this nuclide have been reported since 1961, and recommended values for P-alpha have remained unchanged for years, until recent evaluations suggested new values. This work presents the results of new measurements made with Si detectors and sources of natural uranium. The results obtained for the analysis of twenty spectra are: P-alpha 0 = 0.7754 +/- 0.0050, P-alpha 50 = 0.2233+/-0.0050 and P-alpha 163 = 0.0013 +/- 0.0003. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

If adopted sets of transition probabilities for the transitions of the decay scheme and atomic shell data (such as fluorescence yields and relative emission probabilities) are available, the emission probabilities of the X-rays and Auger electrons can be calculated from these data. Only data calculated in this way are consistent with the adopted input data and can be compared with measured data. Conclusions can be drawn with respect to the internal consistency of the data sets by comparing the measured and calculated data. Hence, the EMISSION program has been developed and tested to calculate X-ray and Auger electron emission probabilities along with their error propagation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Therapeutic applications that began with Ra-226 and Rn-222 implants have rapidly grown to include about 20 radionuclides with radiations specifically chosen to treat at different depths in tissue - ranging from a few millimeters for intravascular therapy to a few centimeters in the case of large solid tumors. Systemic treatments with radiopharmaceuticals have grown from the traditional I-131 to more than ten candidate nuclides which are to be labeled to tumor-specific radiopharmaceuticals. Diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals are used in over 13 million procedures in the United States annually. About 40 nuclides are under investigation for these applications including single photon emitters for SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) and positron emitters for PET (positron emission tomography). In addition to the mainstays of therapeutic and diagnostic radiology, radionuclides are widely used for in vitro tracers in the life sciences and represent one of the main tools in the field of molecular biology.

Accurate activity measurements, however, depend on the application of the correct calibration factor (dial setting) for the radionuclide in the exact measurement geometry for that particular instrument. Two methods are described for the experimental determination of dial settings for the Capintec CRC-12 dose calibrator. Using these methods, we have determined new calibration factors for F-18, Cu-62, Re-186 and Re-188 in several geometries. These new factors are presented, along with previously determined settings, for nuclides commonly used in nuclear medicine. The differences between the calibration factors for the different geometries, as well as the differences between the manufacturer's recommended setting underscore the need for empirically determined dose calibrator settings.

Solutions to this method have been presented but to our knowledge, none of them took into account the covariances for evaluating the uncertainty of measurement. This paper presents new solutions for estimating uncertainties in measurement of radionuclide mixtures by multichannel counting and shows that covariances may contribute significantly to uncertainty of measurement so that they must be evaluated.

Tc-99m solutions are eluted from Mo-99/Tc-99m generators as sodium chloride solutions. As the Mo-99 source is a fission product extracted from the reprocessing of nuclear fuel, one might expect the presence of radioactive impurities. One point of special concern described in the 1997 European Pharmacopoeia (1996) is the possible contamination in alpha-impurities (U, Pu, Am, Cm, ...) which must be very low. In order to check this impurity concentration, we used liquid scintillation counting (LSC) with alpha/beta discrimination and a commercial extractive scintillator, Alphaex(R). We first made measurements using synthetic mixtures of alpha and beta-emitters and then using the real effluent. This paper describes the measurement procedure used with the optimum chemical conditions for a correct extraction of the alpha-emitting nuclides. The sensitivity of the method is also described from the measurements made using the real effluent with an addition of a quantitative amount of alpha particle contamination.

The purpose of the module presented here, called MAC3 (module d'acquisition de coincidences triples), is to process the pulses delivered by the three detectors (photomultipliers) used in our liquid scintillation counting system. The dead-time generated by this module is of the extendible type and the dead-time corrections are made according to the live-time method. This module, which has been developed and tested at LPRI, can replace the complex interconnection of several independent and costly modules. The philosophy governing the choice and the implementation of this type of dead-time as well as the system used for the dead-time corrections is presented. The electronic scheme and the performances are also presented. This module is available in the NIM standard. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Specifically, we report the results of analyses carried out on seawater sampled (a) close to the Thule air base where, in 1968, a US military aircraft carrying four nuclear weapons crashed on sea ice, releasing kilogram quantities of plutonium to the snow pack and underlying seabed sediments, and (b) at a reference station (Upernavik) located similar to 400 km to the south. The data show that most of the plutonium in the dissolved phase at Thule is in the form of Pu(V, VI) (mean, 68 +/- 6%; n = 6), with little if any distinction apparent between surface and bottom waters. Further, the oxidation state distribution at stations close to the accident site is similar to that measured at Upernavik, remote from this site. It is also similar to the distribution observed in shelf waters at midlatitudes, suggesting that the underlying processes controlling plutonium speciation are insensitive to temperature over the range 0-25 degrees C. Measurements using tangential-flow ultrafiltration indicate that virtually all of the plutonium (including the fraction in a reduced chemical form) is present as fully dissolved species. Most of this plutonium would seem to be of weapons fallout origin, as the mean Pu-238/Pu-239,Pu-240 activity ratio in the water column (dissolved phase) at Thule (0.06 +/- 0.02; n = 10) is similar to the global fallout ratio at this latitude (approximate to 0.04). Thus, there is little evidence of weapons-grade plutonium in the water column at Thule at the present time. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Depleted and enriched U3O8 Standard reference materials were used to calibrate the system. An independent calibration was performed by standard gamma-ray point sources. U3O8 SRM samples of the 950 series were analyzed. The present results show that the isotopic abundances of U-235 in SRMs 950, 950a and 950b are higher by +3.6, +0.9 and +0.9% (relative deviation) than the natural value 0.7200%, while relative precisions were +/-0.4, +/-0.7 and +/-0.3%, respectively.

Chemical exchange of tritium with hydrogen on the functional group was used as the mechanism for trapping. The polymers tested include Aurorez polybenzimidazole resin bends, Chelex 100 resin beans, Duolite GT-73, microcrystalline cellulose, ann polyethylenimine. The tests were performed under simulated operating conditions on water obtained fi om the Radioactive Liquid Waste Treatment Facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Tritiated water front the Tritium Systems Test Assembly is discharge to this plant. Polyethylenimine is a water- soluble polymer that was tested using a stirred membrane cell with art ultrafiltration membrane. All of the polymers except polyethylenimine took up tritium from the water. Polybenzimidazole demonstrated the highest tritium uptake. The results are explained on the basis of the type of functional group, hydrogen bonding, and rigidity of the molecular structure of the polymer. The theoretical calculations indicate that significant isotope discrimination requires high-frequency modes with hydrogen bonding contribution and support the experimental findings. Modeling suggested trends that may lean to structures that are more efficient in trapping tritium.

It provides a better agreement with measured urinary excretion data than the current ICRP 67 model. Moreover, the revised model avoids unphysiological assumptions such as the transfer of activity from soft tissue to urinary bladder, that were part of the ICRP model, The new predictions of the activity in feces and in blood after an injection are closer to the available data than the ICRP 67 estimations and there is also a good agreement with the partitioning of plutonium between skeleton and liver obtained from different autopsy studies. Furthermore, the urinary excretion estimated by the improved model has been checked using some data from occupationally exposed individuals. As the plutonium uptake in these workers occurred by inhalation, the improved model and the ICRP 67 model were compared by connecting them to the ICRP 66 respiratory tract model. The improved model consistently yields a better agreement with the measured excretion and higher estimations of intake than the ICRP 67 model.

J	McAllister, JR; Borak, TB; Pellicciarini, DW				McAllister, JR; Borak, TB; Pellicciarini, DW			A method for determining leakage of Xe-133 gas from septum-sealed glass vials	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						nuclear medicine; medical radiation; radioactive materials; exposure, ccupational		We have developed a method for determining the leakage of Xe-133 gas from septum-sealed glass vials that are supplied for medical examinations, Twenty vials each originally containing 370 MBq of Xe-133 and 20 vials each originally containing 740 MBq Xe-133 were measured daily for 26 d, Retention of Xe-133 within the vial was modeled as a first order process with a constant rate coefficient, lambda(T). The value of lambda(T) was estimated for each vial using a regression analysis. The leakage rate, lambda(L), was then determined assuming that lambda(T) = lambda(L) + lambda(r) where lambda(r) represents the physical decay of Xe-133. Monte Carlo simulations were performed using uncertainties in the estimates of each vial to obtain the mean and tails of the distribution for the average leakage rate, <(lambda)over bar>L. The average leakage rate for the complete sample of vials was 0.00007 d(-1) with an upper, one-sided, 95% confidence limit of 0.0011 d(-1). Uncertainties in the published values of lambda(r) for Xe-133 made a significant contribution to the uncertainties of the leakage rate for this sample of vials, The methods described can be applied to other situations where leakage of radioactive materials may be of concern.

J	Emery, RJ; Charlton, MA; Goodman, GR				Emery, RJ; Charlton, MA; Goodman, GR			Radiation safety program outcomes as indicated by regulatory compliance activities from 1988 to 1997 in Texas	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topics; safety standards; radiation protection; quality assurance		Occupational radiation protection programs rarely encounter readily observable workplace injuries or illnesses, so upper management must rely on different indicators of relative performance. In many cases, the number of violations, complaints, and reported incidents is used. As with reported workplace injury and illness data, violation, complaint, and incident data provide only a crude indication of a radiation protection program's overall effectiveness. Even so, it is important to recognize that tangible program outcome measures such as these often dictate management decisions. Hence, safety professionals should have access to baseline violation, complaint, and incident trend data so that more informed preventive strategies can be put into place where possible, To assess the outcomes of radiation protection programs in Texas, data from regulatory compliance activities for a 10-y period, inclusive of calendar years 1988 to 1997, were assembled, summarized, and independently verified, For licensees of radioactive material, the ten most frequently cited violations represented 64% of the total issued during the study period. For registrants of radiation producing devices, the ten most frequently cited violations accounted for 73% of the total. A particular emphasis on proper recordkeeping is evident, and should be noted by any internal radiation protection quality assurance programs. Regardless of the permit type, the vast majority of violations issued were classified as low severity, Licensees were found to be involved in approximately 73% of the incidents recorded, with overexposures and badge overexposures representing the largest identifiable types. Registrants were found to be involved in approximately 57% of the complaints recorded, with the largest identifiable issue being concerns about health care provider qualifications or performance. Although this study was limited to a single state, the results can be of benefit to both quality assurance programs and professional health physics training courses by objectively identifying the areas commonly found to be deficient.

Materials and methods: Cytogenetic analysis using G-banding was performed on peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures from 104 workers from the British Nuclear Fuels PLC facility at Sellafield, UK. The study group comprised 61 men with lifetime cumulative doses > 500 mSv, 39 men with minimal exposure (i.e. <50 mSv) who formed a control group and 4 men with intermediate doses. Results: The slope of the dose-response, adjusted for smoking status, for translocations and insertions was 0.55 +/- 0.31 x 10(-2)/cell/Sv. Consideration of chromosome breakpoints for all aberrations combined in the radiation workers revealed an excess in the C group chromosomes and a deficit in the F group chromosomes with breakpoints being concentrated in the terminal regions whereas the distribution in the control group did not deviate from expectation. Conclusions: The dose-response was not significantly different from the parallel FISH analysis (Tucker ct al. 1997) and confirms that chronic radiation exposure appears to be substantially less effective at inducing stable chromosome aberrations in comparison with acute exposure.

J	Baker, CC				Baker, CC			Possible pathways for pursuing burning plasma physics and fusion energy development	JOURNAL OF FUSION ENERGY			English	Article						fusion energy development		This report has been prepared in response to a request from the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Fusion Energy Sciences to consider possible alternatives on reduced cost options for "next-step" devices. A central focus of next-step devices is the study of "burning" plasmas, which explore the impact of substantial fusion energy production via the deuterium-tritium reaction. An important part of the U.S. Fusion Energy Sciences Program is its participation in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) program. Taking into account the international situation and U.S. domestic issues, the ITER process is exploring reduced-cost options to the present ITER device. A Special Working Group, reporting to the ITER Council, has been formed to explore these issues on behalf of the ITER Parties, i.e., the European Union, Russian Federation, Japan, and the United States. This report and its related activities will aid the United States in the international process. This report is the result of a broad-based U.S. community effort to discuss, debate, and work together on the crucial issues involved in considering next-step options. The main content of this report is based on three potential pathways identified at a broadly attended community Forum for Next-Step Fusion Experiments (University of Wisconsin, Madison, April 1998) organized principally by the University Fusion Association and by the work of the ITER Steering Committee-US (ISCUS) on reduced cost ITER options. The Madison Workshop was followed by a smaller Workshop on Next-Step Options (University of California, San Diego, June 1998) to focus on preparing this report. A broadly-announced Website was established to facilitate access to documents related to this process.

Both exploding pusher and ablative targets were imploded using glass capsules with diameters of 200 and 500 mum, and a wall thickness of about 1 mum. The deuterium and tritium (DT) gas pressure filled in these capsules were 2.0 and 0.5MPa, respectively. Sophisticated diagnostics were deployed to measure laser absorption, hot electron temperature and fraction, thermal electron temperature, neutron yields, ion temperature, temporally resolved x-ray images, fuel areal density, alpha particle image, and so on. Significant results, such as neutron yields up to 4 x 10(9) for exploding pushers with 100-ps laser pulse irradiation and 6 x 10(8) for ablative targets with 1-ns pulses and clear x-ray images to see the compression process, were obtained. Numerical simulations were conducted to optimize target and laser parameter design and to duplicate the results afterwards with the specific shot parameters used in the experiment.

Nuclear stability results mostly from the interplay of these opposing forces, plus Coulomb repulsion of positive charges. Whereas fusion may be the primary mechanism by which first generation stars produce energy, repulsion between like nucleons may cause neutron emission from the collapsed core (neutron star) produced in a terminal supernova explosion and initiate luminosity in second generation stars that accrete on such objects. As noted earlier [1], the scarcity of solar neutrinos, the enrichment of light isotopes in the solar wind, and the presence of abundant short-lived nuclides and interlinked chemical and isotopic heterogeneities in the early solar system might also be explained if the Sun formed in this manner.
