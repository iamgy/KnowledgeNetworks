Account has been taken of previous deliberations of the ICRP, a recent draft report of the NCRP, recent statements from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and other recent research findings regarding the stochastic effects of hot particle exposures. The working group recommends further research to address several topics which fall into four main areas: dosimetry; deterministic effects; stochastic effects; and radiological protection philosophy. The first three topics have been considered in three other papers in these proceedings. This paper concentrates on issues related to radiological protection philosophy which arise from the disparity between recommendations regarding hot particle dose limits of the ICRP, the NCRP and the NRC.

A database was built, which is effectively an annotated bibliography, but the electronic format facilitates extension, updating. and information retrieval. It consists of linked tables of references and experiments, with details and comments on the material, procedures and results. The database contains information from 103 references on 218 inhalation, 35 ingestion and 35 injection experiments. The latter are included because they often complement inhalation studies. It is planned to extend the database. to address ingestion and injection explicitly, and to provide Internet access. Three types of users are envisaged: groups developing standards for internal dosimetry, scientists conducting research on radionuclide biokinetics, and health physicists assessing the consequences of accidental intakes.

For 67Ga, at 19 to 54 h after injection, the observed subcellular distribution patterns were similar in all the tissues studied with 2-5% of the total tissue radioactivity being associated with the cell nuclei. For Zn-62 and In-111 administered as the bleomycin complex or as chloride, as well as for the X ray contrast media I-123/125-Conray and I-123/125-Biligram the fraction associated with the nuclei was only 1-2%. The studies indicate that, for the Ga-67, In-111, Zn-62 complexes or compounds studied, only similar to 1 to 4% of the Auger emissions are likely to arise in the cell nucleus.

Three workers in the plant received high doses of radiation and suffered from various kinds of acute radiation syndrome. Intensive medical care was given but one of them died at 82 days after the exposure. The criticality condition was sustained for 20 h and some workers, other than the three in the plant, together with a few members of the public received measurable radiation doses, although they were low. Evacuation of neighbouring residents was carried out as a protective measure and was effective for the reduction of doses to the public. Radioactivity released into the environment was low and resulted in very low doses to the members of the public, other than the neighbouring residents.

The techniques are based on the results of radiation monitoring performed since 1986 in the Bryansk, Tula, Orel and Kaluga regions of Russia. The WBC measurements of the thyroid or whole body provide the data most relevant to internal dose, and are of first priority for dose reconstruction. Radionuclide intake estimation with food products is considered as the second priority and application of radioecological models as the third priority when measurement data are absent. For the calculation of internal dose intake functions are suggested that describe both consequences of vegetation surface contamination with I-131 and Cs-134,Cs-137 in the early period and long-term radionuclide transfer via root systems. The first experimental data on the dependence of I-131 concentration in milk on time, and on density of soil contamination with Cs-137 in four regions of Russia are given. A strong connection between I-131 concentration in milk and thyroid dose in inhabitants based on I-131 in thyroid measurements is proved. Regularities revealed are used for thyroid dose reconstruction in Russian inhabitants. The results explain the phenomenon of the increased thyroid cancer morbidity in areas with low radioactive contamination.

According to these results, this compound has been found to have an intermediate type of absorption between Types F and M as designated by ICRP for the human respiratory tract. A dose coefficient of 1.4 mu Sv.Bq(-1) has been calculated fur an inhaled aerosol with an AMAD of 5.1 mu m (sigma(g) = 2.5), which corresponded to the mean value encountered at the fluorination workplace. Predictive urinary and faecal excretion and lung retention curves have also been deduced to calculate the incorporated activity and the received dose in case of an inhalation of UF4 by workers.

J	Cavallo, A				Cavallo, A			The radon equilibrium factor and comparative dosimetry in homes and mines	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							SIZE DISTRIBUTION; EXPOSURE; PROGENY	The equilibrium factor, a measure of the degree of radioactive equilibrium between radon and its short-lived radioactive decay products, is often assumed to be 0.4 for risk assessment. While this is usually a reasonable assumption, there are important exceptions, in particular, in active mines where ventilation rates are high, the equilibrium factor can be much less than 0.4. In such cases, if lung dose rate is computed based on measured activity size distributions and normalised to radon concentrations, comparisons to lung dose rate in other environments must take into account possible differences in the equilibrium factor. In the comparative dosimetry section of the BEIR VI Report, this critical step was omitted. Thus, the ratio of home lung dose rate to diesel miner lung dose rate is actually 0.44, not 1 as stated in the Report. This oversight may have major public policy implications.

Well-established nuclear techniques were employed to measure the specific activities of Ra-226, Ra-228. K-40, and Cs-137 in fifty-six samples of manioc-root flour gathered in 20 Brazilian states. Whereas the activities for K-40 were much the same as those found in other vegetables, the activities of radium proved to be in significant amounts: 0.2-7.2 Bq.kg(-1) for:Ra-226, and 0.3-34 Bq.kg(-1) for Ra-228. Annual effective doses caused by the ingestion of manioc flour were also assessed taking into account the diet figures available for ten Brazilian states. For the adult public of those states, the radium (Ra-226 + Ra-228) present in manioc will be responsible for average doses ranging from 3 to 106 mu Sv.yr(-1). However, low-income people living in the states of Rio Grande do Norte, Ceara, and Paraiba (northeast Brazil) could receive doses in the range from 28 to 893 mu Sv.yr(-1).

J	Msaki, P; Banzi, FP				Msaki, P; Banzi, FP			Radioactivity in products derived from gypsum in Tanzania	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								Scientific investigations have long concluded that prolonged exposure to low dose radiation can induce deleterious effects in humans. The aim of this paper is to investigate the radioactivity of gypsum and gypsum derived products as part of a bigger project aimed at establishing radiation levels in materials or/and products suspected to have natural radioactivity radiation risk in Tanzania. In response to the concern expressed by the users of chalk sticks in some schools in Arusha municipality, it was found necessary to establish levels of radioactivity in this product and associated radiation risk. Natural radioactivity content was determined in chalk dust, natural gypsum and normal background soil using a hyper pure germanium spectrometer (HPGe). The soil measurements were used as control. Results have shown that the concentration of Ra-226 and Ra-228 nuclides found in chalk dust were 24.25 Bq.kg(-1) and 22.86 Bq.kg(-1), respectively. These levels were lower or comparable to the corresponding 34.2 Bq.kg(-1) and 21.5 Bq.kg(-1), respectively, found in soil. However, the radioactivity levels found in the chalk dust were five times higher than that found in the gypsum 5 Bq.kg(-1) for Ra-226 and 4 Bq.kg(-1) for Ra-228. These values compare well with the value recorded for natural gypsum in Denmark of 7 Bq.kg(-1) for Ra-226 and 4 Bq.kg(-1) for Ra-228 by UNSCEAR. The calculated external (0.21) and internal (0.31) hazard indices due to radioactivity in chalk dust were respectively, lower than (0.26 and 0.35) hazard indices calculated for normal background soil. In both cases, the hazard indices were lower than the acceptable limits (less than or equal to 1) recommended for building materials. This study has shown that natural gypsum and gypsum derived products have traces of radioactivity. However, the associated levels are not detrimental to health.

Early health effects are radiation diseases that occur within six weeks after the exposure. The present investigation provides data needed for subsequent analysis of the accuracy of estimates of the risks from nuclear power plant accidents (accident consequence assessments). By means of a formal expert elicitation procedure, for a limited number of exposure cases, a set of data has been obtained that quantifies the accuracy of risk estimates for early health effects. These data have been implemented in the generic models for calculating the risk and the accuracy of the calculated risk. These generic models are currently applied in accident consequence assessments.

Increasing use is being made of PCA tools as an input to the evaluation and improvement of safety for nuclear installations. The nature and extent of the assessment performed varies considerably according to its intended purpose. Nevertheless with the increasing use of such techniques, greater attention has been given to the reliability of the methods used and the inherent uncertainty associated with their predictions. Uncertainty analyses can provide the decision-maker with information to quantify how uncertain the answer is and what drives that uncertainty. They often force a review of the baseline assumptions for any PCA methodology and provide a benchmark against which the impact of further changes in models and recommendations can be compared. This process provides valuable management information to help prioritise further actions or research.

These subjects had chronic inhalation exposure at low levels for 25 to 30 years. Subsequently, they were removed from active work and subjected to whole-body counting at the thorax region, using a shadow-shield whole-body counter, over a period of time. Results of repeated counting, extended over a period of more than three years, indicated the clearance half-life for thorium to be 954 +/- 97 days. As these subjects had chronic inhalation exposure for 25 to 30 years, the observed elimination may not be considered as lung clearance, but as thorax clearance.

It is important to measure radon progeny concentration because almost all dose from radon is caused by its short-lived progeny. The various features of the monitor are a large sampling flow rate with 80 l.min(-1) and the use of alpha energy spectrometry in a Vacuum vessel. These have been adopted to obtain high sensitivity and resolution. Use of a long roll-type membrane filter and a reliable automatic system enabled continuous measurement for more than one month. The measurements using the monitors around the closed mine were carried out and the environmental effect was estimated to be less than 1 mSv.y(-1).

J	Griffith, RV				Griffith, RV			The role of intercomparisons and intercalibrations in the improvement of internal dose assessment	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Workshop on In Vivo Monitoring for Internal Contamination	MAY 21-24, 1999	MOL, BELGIUM	Nuclear Res Ctr, Inst Protect & Nuclear Safety, European Commiss, US DOE			QUANTIFY PREVIOUS EXPOSURES; RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS; PHANTOM; DETECT	In-vivo monitoring and dose assessment is a highly technical field. Moreover, it is carried out by a relatively small number of specialists. A number of technical steps can be taken to improve internal dosimetry programmes. However, one of the most valuable activities for overall improvement of measurement programmes is active participation in national and international intercomparisons and intercalibrations. These bring a number of benefits to the internal dosimetry programme, including validation of measurement practices, harmonisation of techniques, information exchange, and training. The number of intercalibration and intercomparison activities conducted on the national and international level has grown in recent years. These activities may involve actual measurement programmes or calculation exercises to compare approaches used for assessment of internal dose from measurement results. When conducted effectively such programmes are a highly cost effective use of limited resources. They also contribute to the credibility of the overall dosimetry process. Intercomparisons should be an important component of the in vivo measurement programme. Cooperation between the organisers of various intercomparison activities is essential to avoid unnecessary duplication and ensure the most effective use of the participants' time and energy. Future activities should address the use of simplified phantoms and source arrays to expedite shipping, reduce cost, and contribute to more timely conduct of intercomparisons. It is also important that managers and regulatory authorities be prepared to support intercomparison and intercalibration programmes.

This project is provided as an outreach service to the public to support education about naturally occurring and man-made radioactivity present in people and the environment prior to the opening of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). The bioassay measurements consisted of a lung and whole-body count. Prior to their bioassay, each subject completed a lifestyle questionnaire which included questions regarding their age, sex, weight, height, ethnicity, occupation, foreign travel, wild game consumption, smoking habit and any nuclear medicine procedures. Since a majority of these radio-nuclides were not detectable in local residents, a primary focus of the study was to evaluate the Variability of human background and the implications with respect to measurement sensitivity.

The Volume of the 38.5 litre collection chamber was optimised with respect to the breathing rate, the decay constant of thoron, the electric field geometry and strength, and the humidity of air. Calibration was achieved by means of a calibrated Th-228 source. A minimum detectable activity of 45 mBq Ra-224 freely emanating Rn-220 at the mouth (Ra equivalent) was achieved. Five Thorotrast patients were measured and data ranged from 40 up to 150 Bq Ra equivalent, indicating an exhalation factor of about 4.0 +/- 1.9% of the total Rn-220 produced in the body. Data from 53 workers showed burdens up to 23 Bq (mean 5.5 Bq) of thorium. Urine bioassays of samples from the same workers yielded corresponding results. In vivo measurements revealed no result above the detection limit of 25 Bq Tl-208.

The procedures involving radioactive substances were recorded and tested for the risk of incorporation by workers. For 20 workers involved in these procedures, a total of 108 measurements of whole-body activity were performed. From these, incorporated activities and resulting effective doses were computed conservatively. Whole-body activity above the detection limit (50 Bq) was measured in 38 of 79 cases, above 1500 Bq in only 4 cases. Estimated yearly doses exceeded 50 mu Sv in only 10 of 79 cases and never exceeded 1500 mu Sv. internal exposure from routine procedures in a PET centre is rather low. The estimated doses do not warrant the necessity of incorporation monitoring on a regular basis. However, availability of a whole-body measurement facility within 24 h of an incident is recommended as well as monitoring of airborne activity during transport and handling of gaseous radioactivity.

It is intended for calibration of whole-body counters with the investigated person in the standing and lying positions as well as sitting straight or stooping down. The phantom consists of a set of polyethylene rectangular blocks with masses 0.88 and 0.40 kg. A set of solid rod radionuclide sources, 6 mm in diameter, are inserted inside the blocks. Two sources are inserted in each black. The blocks are connected by means of fixing arms. The principal advantage of the solid phantom as compared to the phantoms that contain radioactive solutions is the safety of operation and the possibility of replacement of the radionuclide sources if it is necessary. The unified phantom was verified against the BOMAB calibration phantom and compared to the REMCAL type phantom.

The ICRP Publication 66 models this process by means of a system of filters. This model simulates the deposition of an infinitely divided substance, e.g. gas, liquid or airborne radioactivity: when the number of inspired particles, N --> infinity. A Monte Carlo computer model of respiratory system is used in this study to describe the deposition of aerosol particles in the respiratory system, and to investigate directly the fluctuations in the deposition patterns of radioactive material in a human body after an inhalation of an aerosol. These fluctuations in deposition result in significant uncertainty in interpreting outcomes of in vivo monitoring of internal contamination. The influence of the size of aerosol particles on these uncertainties is also discussed.

J	Molokanov, AA; Badjin, VI				Molokanov, AA; Badjin, VI			Internal dose estimates for workers exposed to plutonium by performing in vivo measurements of Am-241	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Workshop on In Vivo Monitoring for Internal Contamination	MAY 21-24, 1999	MOL, BELGIUM	Nuclear Res Ctr, Inst Protect & Nuclear Safety, European Commiss, US DOE			MODELS	Individual dose estimates for workers chronically exposed to plutonium is an important task in the investigation of possible health effects from internal plutonium depositions. Systemic and total body deposition of plutonium is usually estimated from urinalysis. However, this technique used alone results in uncertainty in individual dose assessment, by about an order of magnitude. Direct in vivo measurements of Am-241 content in lungs, skeleton and Liver by whole-body counting allows one to improve the result of dose assessment. First of all the improvement is due to the additional qualitative information about the route of intake (sorting out subjects with contaminated wounds) and solubility of plutonium aerosol particles (estimating the lung/skeleton ratio). This paper develops an algorithm for performing quantitative estimates of individual doses for workers, using the results of in vivo measurements of Am-241 by whole-body counting. The algorithm applies the new ICRP Publication 66/67 models and takes into account such parameters as the (241)pU/(239)pU ratio, effective aging time of mixed fission products and actinides, particle size distribution of plutonium aerosols and some other parameters. The uncertainties in individual dose assessment due to application of these parameters were analysed. It was shown that regular in vivo measurements of Am-241 in the lungs allow the detection of a single intake of plutonium at a level of the order of one ALI and can be a good monitoring programme for individuals involved in operations with plutonium treated in nuclear fuel cycle.

The phantom has the external shape and appearance of the human adult knee and contains a realistic femur, patella, tibia, and fibula. Unique formulations of polyurethanes, CaCO3, and other trace materials are used in construction of the phantom to produce substitutes for human tissue having the same density, attenuation coefficient, and effective Z as that of human muscle and trabecular bone. The formulation for trabecular bone includes provision for a precisely known quantity of radioactive material that is either uniformly distributed throughout the bone matrix or deposited on the exterior surface. The knee phantom is assembled in three interlocking sections that simplify inserting the skeletal structures and prevent streaming. One or more detectors can easily be positioned on the top or sides of the phantom. Intercomparison measurements of Am-241 in bone using separate arrays of phoswich and germanium detectors demonstrate that a single knee phantom exhibits the same detection efficiency as that using the skull. Irt vivo measurement of the knee is a desirable alternative to the head if facial contamination is present or when evaluating recent exposure to bone seeking radionuclides, since bones of the knee exhibit more rapid uptake than the skull. In practice, greater measurement efficiency can be obtained by placing detectors over both knees since a larger fraction of the total body activity is observed. Calibration measurements using the new anthropometric knee phantom demonstrate that it is durable, easy to use, and provides consistent results over repeated measurements.

The calibration method presented employs a mathematical phantom, produced in the form of volume elements (voxels), obtained through magnetic resonance images of the human body. The voxel phantom has a format of 871 'slices' each of 277 X 148 picture elements. The calibration method uses the Monte Carlo technique to simulate the tissue contamination, to transport the photons through the tissues and to simulate the detection of the radiation. The program was applied to obtain calibration factors for the in vivo measurement of Am-241 deposited on the cortical bone surface of a real contamination case, and to the simulation of in vivo measurements of Am-241 deposited on the cortical bone surface of four head phantoms and also in the lung, as measured with a germanium detector. The calculated and real activities in all cases were found to be in good agreement. The program was also applied to the measurement of natural uranium in the lung, and a real case whore-body contamination with Cs-137. The results indicate that mathematical phantoms could eventually complement physical phantoms in the calibration of in vivo measurements for radionuclides.

Measurements show that by turning the lower collimator slit 45 degrees, the lateral position of a radioactive point source could be determined with an accuracy of about two centimetres by the difference in profile-peak channel between the detectors. This difference was independent of the depth of the source in the phantom. The depth of the point source could be determined by the ratio of the counts in the profile peak from the detectors. This ratio was independent of the lateral displacement. The method can also be used for other radionuclides and an application in radiation protection is to make simultaneous pulse height and profile measurements which makes it possible to apply correction factors for various spatial distributions of the contamination.

To improve the capability for measuring Pb-210 in vivo, the LRRI In Vivo Bioassay Facility (TVBF) has been modified for making Pb-210 measurements in skull by: (1) maximising the solid angle of detection through the use of six phoswich detectors placed about the head, (2) substantially reducing uranium contamination in the detection volume by replacing contaminated Be windows in the detectors, and (3) reducing the effect of variable levers of Rn progeny within the counting room on the background spectra by internally filtering the air within the IVBF to filter out Rn progeny as they are being formed. Based on the above improvements, a limit of detection of 3 Bq of Pb-210 has been achieved in a 90 min measurement.

This modification in the counting philosophy can be useful because the use of new radionuclides in nuclear medicine and the recycling of plutonium in reactor fuel materials require new techniques. They are based on the use of room temperature detectors (silicon and CdZnTe diodes principally), on long duration counting performed out of shielding rooms and on special detector mountings such as a jacket allowing the detectors to be held in a fixed position on the measured organ. The counting can be done without shielding rooms when the detector geometry is adapted to the investigated photon energy so that the control of the intake can be done soon after the suspected contamination accident. The characterisation of the background is of primary importance in the counting of low energy photons and is described by considering the required detection limits and the effect of the counting geometry on the accuracy. The detector position, the bias voltage, the detector thickness and the shielding environment are described on the basis of experimental results. The study of metabolism is a new application for these designs and techniques.

The latter in particular depends critically on the performance achieved for sensitivity and spatial resolution. An original approach of computer assisted collimation gamma camera (French acronym CACAO) which could meet suitable characteristics has been proposed elsewhere. CACAO requires detectors with high spatial resolution The present work was aimed at investigating the application of the CACAO principle on a laboratory testing bench using silicon detectors made of small pixels.

An in vitro study has been carried out on two samples of industrial UO4 to compare the results with those obtained with UO2. Ten UO2 samples supplied by different fuel factories or research laboratories, presented specific surface areas from 1.00 to 4.45 m(2).g(-1). The wide range of values of SSA was due to the different conditions of fabrication. Dissolution tests in cell culture medium made on these ten samples have shown that the solubility increased 2.5-fold when the SSA increased 1.7-fold. The same tendency has been found for UO4, a soluble compound, and for U3O8, a moderately soluble compound. Four in vivo experiments carried out on rats by intratracheal instillation of dust suspensions of UO2, have highlighted the decrease in lung retention and the increase of absorption to blood with the SSA. The experimental absorption parameters calculated from the in vivo data allowed specific dose coefficients to be obtained which decreased from 6.6 to 4.3 mu Sv.Bq(-1) when the SSA increased from 1.60 to 3.08 m(2).g(-1). Thus, the medical monitoring of workers at the workplace has to take into account any change in the fabrication process of the uranium compound which can affect the physicochemical properties and consequently the dose coefficient.

A single urine sample was also collected for many of the measured persons. The possibility of estimating the whole-body Cs-137 from a Single urine sample was investigated by comparing the body burden of Cs-137 derived from field measurements with data on the urinary excretion of Cs-137, using various normalisation parameters. Coefficients for assessing the body burden from a single urine sample were calculated for each method. The in vivo measurements were carried out using a 63 mm diam. x 63 mm NaI(Tl) detector and a single-channel analyser in villages in the Bryansk region of Russia, in September each year. The urine samples were collected from adults as well as from children, and later analysed for Cs-137, potassium and creatinine concentrations. The correlation between whole-body content and urinary excretion of Cs-137 did not improve by introducing potassium or creatinine normalisation. This study indicates that the most reliable method to estimate Cs-137 body burden from urine analysis is simply to use the concentration of Cs-137. Ag, and sex dependent factors for the calculation of Cs-137 body burden from a single urine sample are presented.

J	Farai, IP; Jibiri, NN				Farai, IP; Jibiri, NN			Baseline studies of terrestrial outdoor gamma dose rate levels in Nigeria	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Editorial Material								The outdoor gamma radiation exposure dose rates due to the radioactivity concentration of K-40, U-238 and Th-232 in the soil across different environments in Nigeria have been carried our using the low-cost method of in situ gamma ray spectrometry. Measurements were made in 18 cities, spread across the three major zones of the country. The radioactivity concentrations of these radionuclides in the soil were used to determine their gamma radiation absorbed dose rates in the air. The range of average total dose rate due to the three radionuclides in the Eastern zone is between 0.025 and 0.081 mu Gy.h(-1) with an average of 0.040 +/- 0.006 mu Gy.h(-1), 0.041 and 0.214 mu Gy.h(-1) with a mean of 0.089 +/- 0.014 mu Gy.h(-1) for the Western zone and between 0.066 and 0.222 mu Gy.h(-1) with a mean of 0.102 +/- 0.032 mu Gy.h(-1) for the Northern zone. The average annual outdoor effective dose equivalents of 51 +/- 8 mu Sv.y(-1), 114 +/- 18 mu Sv.y(-1) and 130 +/- 41 mu Sv.y(-1) have been estimated for the Eastern, Western and Northern zones, respectively. The average annual effective dose equivalent for the country has been estimated ro be 98 +/- 15 mu Sv.y(-1) and the collective effective dose equivalent as 9.7 x 10(3) man.Sv.y(-1). Measurements have been taken as representing the baseline values of natural radioactivity as no artificial radionuclide was detected at any of the sites surveyed.

J	Kramer, GH; Hauck, BM				Kramer, GH; Hauck, BM			Intercomparison of JAERI torso phantom lung sets	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							CALIBRATION	During the course of an IAEA sponsored international in vivo intercomparison study using the JAERI phantom, the HML was able to compare photon counting statistics among thirteen lung sets made by three suppliers. Three sets consisted of sliced lungs with planar inserts. The others consisted of whole lung sets with the activity homogeneously distributed throughout the tissue substitute material. Radionuclides in the study were: natural uranium, 3% enriched uranium, Am-241, Pu-238, Pu-239, Eu-152, and Th-232. The study found that one Am-241 lung set gave a counting efficiency 25% higher than expected. The sliced lung sets were in excellent agreement with the whole lung sets showing them to be good approximations for lung sets that have the radioactive material homogeneously distributed throughout the lung equivalent material. Agreement between lung sets at photon energies above 60 keV is within 12% (2 sigma) and within 30% (2 sigma) at lower photon energies.

The ability to measure proper microdosimetric spectra, as well as the dose equivalent response, of the REM500 was evaluated with five radioisotopic neutron sources ((238)pULi, (PuF)-Pu-238, (PuB)-Pu-238, (PuBe)-Pu-236 and Cf-252) and the monoenergetic 14 MeV neutrons. The response (counts.mSv(-1)) and sensitivity (counts per neutron) as a function of average neutron energy were determined. Based on the measured pulse height spectra, the frequency-mean and dose-mean lineal energy values, as well as the mean quality factors, were derived for all sources. The neutron dose equivalent determined using both the dose and mean quality factor measured by the REM500 agreed well with the neutron sources' reference values of ICRP 21 maximum dose equivalent. However, for the REM500 to measure proper lineal spectra in accelerator fields, the low sensitivity and inaccurate measurements for high energy neutrons are areas that may need improvement.

J	Sam, AK; Al-Geed, AMMA				Sam, AK; Al-Geed, AMMA			Radiological evaluation of gold mining activities in Ariab (Eastern Sudan)	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							GAMMA-RADIATION; RADIOACTIVITY	Calculations of individual affective dose per annum have been made from the activity concentrations of dominant gamma-emitting radionuclides front uranium and thorium decay chains in ore, solid waste (spoil heap) and soil samples collected from Adassedakh and Hadal Auatib gold mines in Ariab (Eastern Sudan). Measurements were performed using a high-resolution gamma spectrometer. Independent of location, the data show that the activity concentration for Ra-226 and Th-232 increases in the order: soil > spoil heap > ore. This order basically confirms that the activity levels in the spoil heap are low relative to natural background (i.e, soil samples). and thus the expected contribution in enhancement of natural background radiation is correspondingly low. The concept of concentration ratio (CR) has been applied to quantify the degree of accumulation of radionuclides in the solid waste (heap). The calculated CR values revealed that Th-232 is most accumulated while there is no accumulation of K-40. The absorbed dose rates in air at a height of 1 m as estimated using DRCF from activities of Pb-241, Bi-214, Pb-212, Ac-228, Tl-208 and K-40 ranges from 6.6 to 32.3 nGS.h(-1) (Adassedakh), and 2.2 to 26.1 nGy.h(-1) (Hadal Auatib). The principal contributors to the total dose rate are K-40, Bi-214 and Ac-228 Which generate almost 90%. The corresponding annual effective doses fall within the range: 0.04-0.20 mSv.y(-1) for Adassedakh and 0.01-0.16 InSv.y(-1) for Hadal Auatib. Although, these estimates do not include the internal radiation burden due to inhalation of radon and its decay products, the values obtained are insignificant relative to the dose limit specified for occupational exposure of any worker.

A review of the animal studies which have demonstrated that in animals treated with DTPA either a reduction in bone tumour incidence from internally deposited Pu-239 and Am-241, or a significant increase in survival time map occur, suggests that it is reasonable to assume this could also occur in humans. The biokinetics and bioinorganic chemistry of cobalt, caesium, thorium, uranium, neptunium, plutonium and americium after their entry into the systemic circulation are reviewed briefly. These reviews discuss the general biokinetic behaviour of each element in adult humans with special reference to those aspects of their bioinorganic chemistry that either underlie existing approaches to decorporation therapy, or which might be exploitable for new types of treatment.

J	Krahenbuhl, MP; Wilde, JL; Slaughter, DM				Krahenbuhl, MP; Wilde, JL; Slaughter, DM			Using plutonium excretion data to predict dose from chronic and acute exposures	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							PU	Using fission track analysis (FTA) in conjunction with a composite, theoretical model of the transport of plutonium (Pu) in the human body creates a new opportunity to estimate the exposure and dose to the general population due to plutonium in the environment. For the purposes of this study, data derived from FTA performed at the University of Utah's Center for Excellence in Nuclear Technology, Engineering and Research (CENTER) has been used to predict doses for two populations. Both population groups have no known history of plutonium exposures. Therefore, two exposure scenarios (acute and chronic) were assumed to provide boundaries for dose estimates. Dose predictions focus on equivalent dose to lung, liver, and skeletal systems and range from 0.01 mSv to 560 mSv as a function of organ, sample collection interval and exposure type. Additionally, these reconstructions demonstrate the sensitivity of dose calculations to time of sample collection and duration of exposure. As anticipated for a class Y particle, the predicted average equivalent tissue dose to the lungs represents the highest dose to the evaluated compartments. Furthermore, the data imply that the general population receives a dose one order of magnitude lower than a radiation worker with no history of exposure for the equivalent exposure scenario.

J	Bhati, S; Sharma, RC				Bhati, S; Sharma, RC			Uncertainties in the internal dosimetry of plutonium evaluated using old and new respiratory tract models	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							WORKERS	Assessment of internal deposition and hence intakes of plutonium due to chronic inhalation of its aerosols, are generally based on interpretation of bioassay urinary measurements with the aid of human respiratory tract models. However, the uncertainties in the estimates of intakes arise due to contributions from previous intakes, non-uniform exposure pattern in the current year and probable presence of transients close to the monitoring time. A comparative study of the evaluation of uncertainties in the estimates of intakes of Pu-239 aerosols of sizes 1 mu m and 5 mu m AMAD using respiratory tract models of ICRP 30 and 66, is presented here. Similar predictions by the two models of the uncertainties associated with previous intakes as well as non-uniform exposures in the current year are significant results. However, effects of the transients are predicted to be different by the two models for Pu-239 aerosols of 1 mu m but similar for 5 mu m AMAD. These results could be utilised to reduce the overall uncertainty in the estimate of an intake. Finally, CEDs per mBq of activity measured in 24 h urine samples have been computed for all the cases and for both the lung models to facilitate assignments of doses to radiation workers.

The activity measurements were performed using a HpGe detector. The aggregated transfer factors (ATF) for Cs-137 in 21 local mushroom species collected from 1993 to 1997, showed differences as large as 3 orders of magnitude. The annual effective dose for Cs-137 due to the consumption of mushrooms was estimated to range between be 0.22 and 1.2 mu Sv.y(-1) depending on the method used for calculation. Using the geometric mean of the caesium concentration, the contribution of mushrooms represents 56% of the total Cs-137 dietary intake.

J	Ham, GJ; Harrison, JD				Ham, GJ; Harrison, JD			The gastrointestinal absorption and urinary excretion of plutonium in male volunteers	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							HUMAN GUT; ENVIRONMENTAL PLUTONIUM; BIOKINETIC MODELS; ACTINIDES; AMERICIUM; URANIUM; PU	The gastrointestinal absorption and urinary excretion of Pu-244 have been measured in five healthy adult males in a two-stage study. Firstly, the volunteers ingested about 10(14) atoms of Pu-244 in citrate solution with a mid-day meal and urinary excretion was measured for the following 7-9 days. After a period of at least six months, the same volunteers were given an intravenous injection of 2 X 10(12) atoms of Pu-244 in citrate solution. Urinary excretion was then measured for the following 7-9 days and subsequently at intervals over periods up to 5-6 years. Fractional absorption of Pu from the gastrointestinal tract, calculated by comparing excretion for the two routes of administration, averaged 6 X 10(-4), consistent with the ICRP value of 5 X 10(-4). The results show a positive correlation between increasing age of the subjects, between 36 and 64 years of age, and increasing absorption of ingested Pu from 10(-4) to 10(-3). In general, results for urinary excretion after injection are consistent with predictions of the current ICRP model although daily excretion after 5-6 years (3 subjects) averaged 0.005% of the administered amount, about twice the predicted value.

The concentration range investigated was from 10(-8) mol/l to 5 . 10(-6) mol/l for the uranyl ion and from 1 to 2.5 mg/l for the humic acid. The experimental data obtained by AE are well described by the complexation reaction involving the charge neutralization of the uranyl ion with two exchanging sites of humic acid. The complexation constant calculated by taking the loading capacity values into account is found to be log beta = 6.08 +/- 0.15. Concerning EIF an interfering interaction between the humic acid and U(VI), occurring under the effect of the electric field, is evident and makes this separation technique not well suitable for the investigation of the U(VI):humic acid system.

The method is based on the concept of thermodynamically simple solutions and on water activity measurements. An application is described in which binary data for plutonium(IV) nitrate are determined from a ternary mixture of Pu(NO3)(4), HNO3 and H2O. This novel application allows the thermodynamic behavior (activity coefficient) to be defined for a fictive solution of plutonium(IV) nitrate in water; the solution is "fictive" in that it does not correspond to physical reality, given that Pu(IV) is insoluble. The results can be used to calculate the activity coefficient of the electrolyte Pu(NO3)(4) in any type of mixture containing nitric acid and other electrolytes for which the binary data are known.

The extraction data have been analyzed by both graphical and theoretical methods by taking into account complexation of the metal ion in the aqueous phase with inorganic ligands and all plausible complexes extracted into the organic phase. The results demonstrate that these metal ions are extracted into xylene as Th(NO3)(4) . 2 TRPO and UO2(NO3)(2) . 2 TRPO. The equilibrium constants of the extracted complexes have been deduced by non-linear regression analysis. Infrared spectral data of the extracted complexes have been used to further clarify the nature of the complexes. The selectivities between these metal ions were evaluated and compared with commercially important extractants like tri-n-butylphosphate (TBP).

Electrochemical and nuclear techniques (cyclic voltammetry, a-counting, Rutherford backscattering) have been used in order to characterize the exchange of thorium, lanthanum and uranium cations, particularly in terms of reversibility and efficiency. This electrochemical process has been compared with the chemical one promoted merely by pH variation, and the efficiency of the two methods has been discussed for each type of cation.

Activities of the Ra isotopes were measured by gamma spectrometry using a low background and high efficiency well type germanium detector. The U isotopes were counted in an alpha spectrometer. The results show that U-238 activity varies between 4.46 and about 308 mBq l(-1) in wells, 0.59 and 17.88 mBq l(-1) in hot springs, 2.19 and 3.21 mBq l(-1) in cold springs, and between 2.5 and 15.70 mBq l(-1) in tap water samples. U-234/U-238 activity ratio is generally higher than 1 which is the equilibrium activity ratio value in closed systems. It varies in the ranges 0.79-2.11 in wells, 0.97-7.39 in hot springs, 2.53-8.30 in cold springs, and 1.14-3.35 in tap water. Unlike well waters, spring waters show low 238U activities and high (234)Ur/U-238 activity ratios. The highest activity of Ra measured in hot mineral water samples is about 150 and 352 times higher than the highest activity of Ra found in well waters and in cold springs, respectively. Ra-226/U-238 activity ratios are in the ranges: 0.07-1.14 in wells, 1.79-2115 in hot springs, 0.86-4.79 in cold springs, and 0.18-5.61 in tap water samples. The data are similar to those published for other regions of the world.
