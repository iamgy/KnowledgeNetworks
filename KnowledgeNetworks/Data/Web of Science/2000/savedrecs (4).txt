In general, the time dependence of the disproportionation has a sigmoidal shape. The disproportionation rate increased with increasing initial hydrogen pressure and showed a 3/2-power dependence on the pressure. As for the temperature dependence, the rate increased with temperature only up to 815 K and then decreased at higher temperatures. Namely, a volcano-type pattern was observed in the Arrhenius plot of the rate constant. In addition, a fairly large isotope effect was observed for the rate of disproportionation between hydrogen and deuterium. These results were explained well by a nucleation and nuclei growth model, in which hydrogen solubility in the ZrCo phase was assumed to play an important role. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The advantages of this membrane system can reduce the final processing gas volume to one tenth of conventional method and also remove moisture directly as condensed water. In the past, a membrane detritiation system was studied, which has some advantage, compared with the conventional method. Recently, the super high permeation (SHP) type membrane (SHP type: about 10 times larger permeability than the high permeation (HP) type, and the H(2)/N(2), selectivity is about 60(HP:140)) has been developed and it will be available with lower cost, though the selectivity is a little poor. In this paper, the membrane detritiation system was studied using SHP type membrane modules, and it was compared with the membrane detritiation system using HP type membrane module and the normal detritiation system. It is found that the system with SHP type membrane can reduce the cost and the size of the system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The gas chromatograph (GC) with cryogenic separation column (cryogenic GC) is one of the most extensively used methods for the analysis of hydrogen isotopes. The micro GC with cryogenic column is expected to improve analysis time, that is a major disadvantage of conventional GC. The present authors have modified the micro GC to use its separation column at cryogenic temperature for H(2), HD and D(2) mixture analysis. Obtained retention time of H(2), HD and D(2) was about 85, 100 and 130 s, respectively. Peak resolution between H(2) and HD, these are nearest each other, was about 1.0. These result suggests that the column developed in this work attained the practical level for the separation of hydrogen isotopes without tritium. Present detection limit of hydrogen isotopes was about 100-200 p.p.m., and it can be improved further by adjustment of separation column. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Methane was selected as a typical tritiated compound because of being known to be hardly decomposed and little data. The performance tests of methane decomposition using ZrNi alloy under various process conditions of gas flowrates (20, 35, 70 and 100 cc min(-1)), granular sizes (70-200, 200-400 and < 400 mesh) and reaction temperatures (823, 848 and 873 K), have been carried out. As a result, the methane and hydrogen concentrations after undergoing decomposition process showed qualitatively similar four-stage-time change profiles for all of the independent experimental conditions. However, the definite dependence of decomposition properties on the decomposition conditions was recognized by observing a duration time of a briskest decomposition rate of more than 70%, volumes of decomposed methane and generated hydrogen.

For accelerated accumulation of helium in the alloy up to 3190 appm (simulating a long-term permeator operation (similar to6 years) when cleaning up the international thermonuclear experimental reactors (ITER) spent D-T fuel mix) the alloy was saturated with tritium at room temperature. High tritium solubility was thus achieved at relatively low pressures. Research results showed that radiogenic helium available in the specimens causes their hardening with significant decrease in plasticity. Structural changes in the specimen material have not been found. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A fusion fuel processing loop was installed and is being tested with tritium under reactor relevant conditions. The loop at the TPL consists of ZrCo based tritium storage beds, a plasma exhaust processing system using a palladium diffuser and an electrolytic reactor, cryogenic distillation columns for isotope separation, and analytical systems based on newly developed micro gas chromatographs and Raman Spectroscopy. Several extended demonstration campaigns were performed under realistic reactor conditions to test tritiated impurity processing. A sophisticated control technique of distillation column was performed at the same time, and integrated fuel circulation was successfully demonstrated. Major recent design work on the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) tritium plant at the TPL is devoted to water detritiation based on liquid phase catalytic exchange for improved tritium removal from waste water.

Two distinct spectra were detected by BIXS, one due to the characteristic X-rays giving rise to a sharp intense peak; and the other due to the bremsstrahlung X-rays leading to abroad weak peak. The intensities of these peaks for palladium decreased with time at room temperature, while they were almost constant for the Zr-sample at room temperature. Heating the Zr-sample, however, caused similar changes in the spectra as those for palladium at room temperature. It was found that these phenomena are due to the diffusion of tritium into the bulk regions, causing a reduction of the tritium concentration in the sub-surface layers of the samples. All of the observed P-ray induced X-ray spectra could be reproduced well by computer simulation by assuming respective depth profiles of tritium in the samples. It was confirmed that BIXS is quite useful to analyze the dynamic transport behavior of tritium in materials. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the reduced pulse length and the lower fraction of campaign time spent in burn mode, together with the lower integrated operating lifetime proposed, will generate cost savings in several systems of the fuel cycle. As the quantity of tritium handled per pulse is now smaller, this could be buffered, allowing systems in the tritium plant still to operate in steady state mode as in the FDR design, thereby increasing the potential for downsizing of system capacities. The lower operating time fraction will increase performance margins for some systems, for example, the Torus Exhaust Gas Processing System (TEGPS) which was designed to meet a specified daily release rate for the FDR design conditions which were more onerous than RTO/RC-ITER. As no break through of tritium into cooling water is now expected, the duties of the Water and Atmosphere Detritiation Systems are considerably reduced, and design concepts which are simpler, cheaper and more amenable to modular implementation can be adopted.

Properties of membrane pumping were investigated with the use of a plasma device simulating divertor plasma conditions. The deposition of metal (Fe) and non-metal (C) impurities on the membrane upstream surface results in a degradation of plasma driven superpermeation at the membrane temperature T(m) < 800<degrees>C, though the superpermeation regime is sustained at T(m) greater than or equal to 800 degreesC. The same temperature effect on superpermeation is observed at sputtering of membrane surface by energetic plasma ions. In addition, the first application of the membrane pumping to fusion devices has been carried out and a deuterium pumping through the membrane was demonstrated under the conditions of divertor plasma in the JFT-2M tokamak.

From the results of spectral measurements of the reaction products, aldehydes (RCTO), alcohol (ROT) and carboxylic acids (RCOOT) were found in solid phase and tritiated water and methane in gas phase. From rapid resume of absorption band intensities of CO and CO, following intentional extraction of the sample gas, it was revealed that 'quasi-equilibrium states' existed by balancing consumption and reproduction of CO and CO2. The ratio -Delta CO/ + Delta CO2 was much higher than that reported for the CO transformation by alpha irradiation and in proportion to tritium concentration in the gas phase. Tritium was accumulated in the condensed reaction products and estimated to move into the condensed phase from the gas phase about 5% per day without any hygroscopic substance. The solid products of this system, which remained for a long time, would be carboxylic acids. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Since a primary goal of the LHD project is demonstration of steady-state high-temperature plasmas, highly reliable and reproducible performance is prerequisite for the LHD pellet injector. The helium Gifford-McMahon (GM) cycle cryogenic refrigerator and conventional pipe-gun mechanism have been employed along with these requirements. Since the triple point temperature of hydrogen is lower than those of isotopes; deuterium and tritium, a careful and steady temperature control is necessary in pellet formation. The amount of propellant gas has been minimized by small reservoir to reduce heat load and inflow into the plasma vacuum chamber. Both robustness and flexibility have been realized by using the programmable logic controller combined with GUI on WindowsNT. The pellet injector has demonstrated continuous hundreds of injection without any fail and has been applied for the LHD experiment successfully. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The reaction rate was found to be directly proportional to the initial tritium concentration in the gas mixture. From the initial rate of CO pressure decrease, an average CO consumption yield per ion pair of 1.6 +/- 0.8 was calculated from a total of 24 experiments. At a constant composition of CO, DT and He, the rate of CO consumption decreased strongly with decreasing total pressure. The main gaseous products found were per-tritiated methane, per-tritiated higher hydrocarbons, and carbon dioxide. Water and possibly formaldehyde were identified as minor products. Heated palladium/silver from permeators such as used in fusion machine fuel clean-up considerably enhance the radiation-induced reaction rate between tritium and carbon monoxide.

Nowadays its huge consumption has however come to threaten our life and we have to prepare nonfossil fuels, for instance solar energy, biomass energy, nuclear energy and so on. Fusion energy is an unlimited resource and one of the strongest candidates of the future energy source. At the National Institute for Fusion Science (referred to as 'NIFS' hereafter), we have constructed a new fusion experimental device called large helical device (referred to as 'LHD' hereafter) in 1998. The device will generate a small amount of tritium, as a fusion product. In order to remove it from the exhaust gas, we have designed a tritium cleanup system based on a new concept. This system is mainly composed of a palladium permeater, a decomposer and hydrogen absorbing alloys. It may perfectly recover the tritium from exhaust gas without oxidizing it. This system is applicable for the future needs at fusion power plants. In order to remove tritium discharged from fusion experimental facilities, it is usual to employ a system by which tritiated constituents, in various chemical forms, are entirely converted to a form of water vapor by catalytic oxidation. The water vapor containing tritiated form is then absorbed by molecular sieve (referred to as 'wet system' hereafter). However, in the case of LHD, it is not rational to deliberately convert the discharged tritium into the water vapor, because the tritium discharged from LHD is almost in a form of hydrogen molecules. Moreover, the tritium in the form of water vapor affects the human body 18 000 times stronger than that of hydrogen molecules. In accordance with these view points, we have developed another type of tritium cleanup system based on a new concept, in which hydrogen molecules including tritiated ones (HT, DT and T(2)) found in the exhaust gas of LHD are directly fixed to hydrogen absorbing alloys. Other impurities such as methane and water vapor, parts of which are tritiated, will be decomposed into each elemental form by the decomposition process and hydrogen molecules, including tritiated constituents from the decomposition (referred to as 'dry system' hereafter).

Three coating techniques have been studied and characterized: chemical electroless deposition (PdAg film thickness of 10 mum), ion sputtering (about 1 mum) and rolling of thin metal sheets (50 mum). The Pd-ceramic membranes have been used for manufacturing catalytic membrane reactors (CMR) for hydrogen and its isotopes recovering and purifying. These composite membranes and the CMR have been studied and developed for a closed-loop process with reference to the design requirements of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER) blanket tritium recovery system in the enhanced performance phase of operation. The membranes and CMR have been tested in a pilot plant equipped with temperature, pressure and flow-rate on-line measuring and controlling devices. The conversion value for the water gas shift reaction in the CMR has been measured close to 100% (always above the equilibrium one, 80% at 350 degreesC): the effect of the membrane is very clear since the reaction is moved towards the products because of the continuous hydrogen separation. The rolled thin film membranes have separated the hydrogen from other gases with a complete selectivity and exhibited a slightly larger mass transfer resistance with respect to the electroless membranes. Preliminary tests on the sputtered membranes have also been carried out with a promising performance. Considerations on the use of different palladium alloy in order to improve the performances of the membranes in terms of permeation flux and mechanical strength, such as palladium/yttrium, are also reported.

The distribution of tritium in the 16Cr-15Ni-3Mo-1Ti austenitic steel and the martensitic steel DIN 1.4914 (MANET) was analyzed. It was shown that the sites, where tritium concentrates in these materials (hydrogen traps), were connected with dislocations and dislocation piles-up, especially at subboundaries and interfaces. Tritium occurred at grain boundaries only when they included particles of the secondary phase. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The heat transfer parameters of such a binary pebble bed, namely the thermal conductivity and the heat transfer coefficient to the containing wall, have been investigated previously in the experimental device PEHTRA. available at FZK. The experiments allowed to measure the effect of the bed temperature and of constraint exerted by the containing walls. The constraint is defined by the bed interference, i.e. the difference in the radial expansion between bed and the constraining walls related to the bed thickness (Deltal/l). However, with the PEHTRA experiments, it was only possible to achieve a Deltal/l value of 0.1%.(1) A new experimental rig (SUPER-PEHTRA) has been constructed at FZK, which allows to achieve Deltal/l values of 0.3% and to measure the pressure of the expanding bed on the containing walls. First experiments with a binary bed have been performed.(2) The present paper reports on further experiments with binary beds and the establishing of equations correlating the data obtained for the present binary beds and for the binary bed experiments described in Ref.

The effect of a neutron irradiation on helium and tritium mobility and swelling for three beryllium grades fabricated by VNIINM is described in this paper. The beryllium blocks were irradiated with a neutron fluence (E > 0.1 MeV) (2.6 - 3.4) 10(21) cm(-2)(1.3 - 1.8 dpa) at 550 degreesC, 620 degreesC and 790 degreesC. Mass-spectrometry techniques was used to simultaneously monitoring of gas release during isothermal multi-stage annealing over 500 - 1300 degreesC temperature range. It is shown that the first signs of the helium release have been detected at temperature about 700 degreesC, while the intense tritium release has occurred at all stages of annealing. Based on the data obtained, the diffusion parameters( D-o, E) for both the gases in beryllium were calculated. The total amount of helium accumulated in irradiated beryllium varied from 240 appm to 620 appm. The tritium mobility increases significantly when swelling increases, while that for helium changes very slightly. With swelling increase from 0.5 to 1.8% the ratio of helium to tritium retentions changes approximately from 4:1 to 10:1. The tritium and helium retentions and beryllium swelling are presented as functions of the distance from the irradiated surface. The experimental data are also discussed in comparison with calculations.

The thickness of the deposited mixed W-Be layer was similar to 500 nm. The element composition analysis of these layers showed that the mixed layer contains up to 35 at.% W, up to 35 at.% Be and up to 30 at.% O. The W-Be films on Be were irradiated by pulsed deuterium plasma flux in the electrodynamic plasma MKT-accelerator with a deuterium plasma concentration of 10(21) m(-3), maximal ion energy of (1-2) keV and with the energy flux density Of 0.2 MJ/m(2) per pulse. The pulse duration was equal to 60 Ccs After irradiation by two plasma pulses the W-Be film is melted and removed completely from the local surface areas. The element distributions in a mixed layer after an effect of the pulsed plasma are essentially changed. For the surface areas with the removed film the Be concentration is about 75 at.%, W - about 15 at.%, O - about 10 at.% and the penetration of W and O atoms is up to 1000 nm deep of Be substrate. For the surface areas with the retained melted film the Be surface concentration increase up to 90 at.%, tungsten and oxygen concentration decrease about 2-3 times. The method of Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis was used to study D retention. The integral deuterium concentrations are equal to 0.6 10(20) and 2.2.10(20) m(-2) for the removed film areas and for the retained melted film ones, correspondingly. Consequently, deposited W-Be film promotes the essential reduction of D retention in Be substrate. Transmission electron microscopy was used to study the erosion product size distribution. The erosion products were collected on basalt filter fibers located in a shadow of the pulsed plasma flux around the exposed W-Be film target. The erosion product size distribution has two maxima located in the ranges 0.1-0.2 mum and 2.5-5.0 mum.

It has been found that for thermally grown BeO films implanted in the range 300-900 K the total deuterium retention doesn't depend on irradiation temperature whereas TDS spectra are temperature dependent. For R.T. implantation the deuterium is released in a wide range from 500 to 1100 K. At implantation above 600 K the main portion of retained deuterium is released in a single peak centered at about 1000 K. The similar TDS peak is measured for D/BeO co-deposited layer. In addition we correlate our implantation data on BeO with the relevant data on beryllium metal and carbon. The interrelations between deuterium retention and microstructure are discussed.

Plasma spraying of beryllium was evaluated during the ITER Engineering Design Activity (EDA) for in-situ repair and initial fabrication of the beryllium first wall armor. Results have shown that surface roughening of beryllium, during the TA cleaning process, can result in bond strengths greater than 100 MPa between beryllium surfaces and plasma sprayed beryllium. In addition, the TA cleaning process was shown to be an effective method for removing contaminate layers of carbon and tungsten from the surface of beryllium. Investigations have been performed to characterize the different are-types that occur during the TA cleaning process (Type I, II and III arcs) and the effectiveness of the TA cleaning process for potentially removing co-deposited layers of carbon and deuterium from the surface of beryllium, stainless steel and tungsten.

J	Longhurst, GR; Anderl, RA; Willms, RS				Longhurst, GR; Anderl, RA; Willms, RS			Tritium loss in molten Flibe systems	FUSION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Workshop on Beryllium Technology for Fusion	SEP 15-17, 1999	KARLSRUHE, GERMANY	Int Energy Agcy, Fus Mat			SALT	An emerging issue relative to beryllium technology in fusion involves tritium interactions with molten beryllium-bearing salts. Innovative designs for fusion reactors, both magnetic and inertially confined, feature the molten salt mixture 2LiF . BeF2, commonly called Flibe, as a tritium breeder and coolant. Tritium is bred in the Flibe as neutrons from the plasma are absorbed by Li atoms, which then transmute to tritium and helium. Transmutation of tritium from Be also occurs. Among the issues to be resolved for such coolant systems is the potential loss of tritium from the Flibe coolant to the walls of the system, particularly through heat exchanger tubes, and from there into secondary coolants or working fluids and the environment. Effectively removing tritium from Flibe in clean-up units is also important. In quiescent or low Reynolds number flow, tritium movement through Flibe is governed by diffusion. For Flibe in turbulent flow, as in heat exchanger tubes, transport is by turbulent mixing, and the same flow conditions and structural design features that maximize heat transfer to the heat exchanger walls will enhance the transport of tritium to those same surfaces. Analyses have been performed to estimate the fractional loss of tritium through heat exchanger tubes and release rates from Flibe droplets in vacuum disengagers in molten Flibe systems. The calculations suggest unacceptably large losses of tritium through heat exchanger tubes. The gravity of the implications of these estimates calls for experimental verification to determine if tritium losses through molten Flibe heat exchangers or other Flibe systems can really be so high and whether vacuum disengagers will really work. There is also a need for better information on evolution of tritium from Flibe droplets in a vacuum. Several experiments are presently being planned to address these issues and are discussed. These include experiments to induce tritium in Flibe using spontaneous fission neutrons, experiments in flowing loops to evaluated tritium losses through heat exchanger walls, and exploration of schemes for tritium extraction from molten Flibe.

J	Macdonald, A				Macdonald, A			Supervision of site radiography contractors	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topic; gamma radiation; exposure, occupational; radiation, ionizing		Gamma radiography is used extensively under conditions of site radiography for non destructive testing of components where it is nor reasonably practicable to check these components in a shielded enclosure. This is one of the few occasions when a high activity radioactive source is used outside a shielded enclosure and administrative controls are the principal means of restricting exposure. A company where site radiography is required should carry out certain checks themselves to ensure that other personnel not involved in the radiography are not exposed to ionizing radiation. Prior discussion with the radiography company on their safety systems and equipment and checks by the client before and during radiography will reduce the likelihood of unintentional exposures and ensure that no radioactive materials are left on the site.

Under current South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control regulatory guidelines,double dagger these patients are required to be admitted to the hospital and to remain as inpatients until the whole body burden is <30 mCi or the exposure rate measured 1 m from the patient is <5 mR h(-1). We demonstrate that these patients can be released in accordance with the new recommended guidelines of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the release of patients containing radioactive materials in compliance with all radioactive material and public dose standards. This benefits these patients by reducing their risk of infection and other hospital insults and by reducing the length of hospitalizations. Further, unnecessary hospital admissions are decreased, ann the overall cost of healthcare delivery for these patients is significantly reduced.

In this manuscript the mechanism of the coupled anodic (fuel dissolution) and cathodic (oxidant reduction) reactions which constitute the overall fuel corrosion process is reviewed, and the many published observations on fuel corrosion under disposal conditions discussed. The primary emphasis is on summarizing the overall mechanistic behaviour and establishing the primary factors likely to control fuel corrosion. Included are discussions on the influence of various oxidants including radiolytic ones, pH, temperature, groundwater composition, and the formation of corrosion product deposits. The relevance of the data recorded on unirradiated UO2 to the interpretation of spent fuel behaviour is included. Based on the review, the data used to develop fuel corrosion models under the conditions anticipated in Yucca Mountain (NV, USA) are evaluated. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The onset of shrinkage occurs by about 400 degreesC lower in oxidizing atmosphere such as CO2 and commercial N-2 than that occurs in reducing atmosphere. PuO2 and UO2-76%PuO2 showed an expansion on heating in Ar at similar to 1000 degreesC. UO2-20%PuO2 pellet sinters slightly better in Ar than in Ar-8%H-2. From the shrinkage rate curves, it was found that the maximum shrinkage rate occurs in commercial nitrogen atmosphere for UO2-50%PuO2. For the other compositions, the maximum shrinkage rate was observed for Ar atmosphere. The sintering behaviour of above mentioned pellets was discussed with the help of point defect model and the possible mechanisms were suggested. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses reveal that both U(VI) and U(IV) oxidation states are present in the altered layer. The U(VI)/U(IV) ratio in this altered layer increases up to 43 days and then remains constant throughout the whole test. In the leachate the uranium concentration also increases up to 43 days and then stabilizes. It is rather unlikely that the altered layer formed on the surface controls thermodynamically the uranium solubility. It is rather probable that the system has reached a pseudo-equilibrium governed by kinetics. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The results were compared with those for U-233(n(th), f) and with the predicted values by the multi-channel fission theory with the random neck rupture model. The measured and predicted values of the neutron multiplicity, [nu](m*), show the saw-tooth trend and agree with each other. The total neutron multiplicity decreases linearly with increasing total kinetic energy resulting in - d(TKE)/d[nu (tot)]=16.5+/-0.4 MeV/neutron. The slope of the neutron multiplicity vs, the total kinetic energy, -d[nu ]d[TKE], was plotted against the fragment mass. Its shape agrees with that for U-233(n(th), f). The average neutron emission energy, [eta](m*), follows a bell shape about the symmetric fission accompanying higher values for very asymmetric fissions and agrees with that for U-233(n(th), f). The total excitation energy [TXE](m*) was determined by two manners: (1) neutron data and (2) Q(max)-[TKE]. Both results satisfactorily agree with each other as the case of U-233(n(th), f), and thereby the present derivation of [TKE] from the neutron data is confirmed.

The compound has an intense infrared absorption band with a peak at 5.35 mum (1,870 cm(-1)) due to carbonyl stretching vibration.

Three candidate media-commercial alumina cement mixed with calcium sulfate and/or calcium hydroxide-were investigated. The criterion applied for evaluating iodine sorption performance was the distribution coefficient Kd of iodine between solid and solution in an emulsion of sodium iodide solution and powder prepared from the alumina cement/calcium compound mixture, which was molded, cured and ground. Batch sorption experiments were performed on different combinations of the above-mentioned calcium compounds added to alumina cement. The solidified substance was also examined for mechanical strength. The highest iodine sorption performance was obtained with calcium sulfate added to alumina cement to a SO4/Ca mole ratio of 0.16, which ensured a Kd value raised to a level of not lower than 0.2 m(3)/kg from the (1.8-3.2)x10(-3) m(3)/kg obtainable with alumina cement before calcium compound addition. The enhancement of iodine sorption with addition of calcium sulfate is attributed to formation in the substance of monosulfate (3CaO . Al2O3. CaSO4. 12H(2)O) or tetracalcium aluminate hydrate (4CaO . Al2O3. XH2O (X=13 to 19)).

The primary focus of nuclear-forensics investigations of confiscated Pu is to specify correctly its origin. We demonstrate that such specification is possible by means of accurate determination the Pu isotopic composition. In this study, five Pu samples of different origins were analysed by thermal-ionisation mass spectrometry. The source (i.e., the type of production reactor) of each sample was determined by comparing the measured Pu isotopic composition with, that calculated by one of two reactor-production computer codes, ORIGEN2 and SCALE. These results, in conjunction with the age determination of each sample, allow us to deduce the origin of each.

The stability constants of the corresponding chelates with UO2 (II), Th(IV) and Ce(III) were studied potentiometrically at 25 degreesC by applying Irving-Rossotti computing method. The complexes of the nitro-substituted ligands were less stable than the corresponding complexes of the unsubstituted ligands. The stability constants of metal-ligands depend on the ionic radii and ionic charge of metals and also they decrease with steric repulsions of the nitro groups.

J	Yamada, M; Nagaya, Y				Yamada, M; Nagaya, Y			Vertical profiles, inventories, and activity ratios of Pu239+240 and Cs-137 in sediments from Sagami Bay, western Northwest Pacific margin	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ANTHROPOGENIC RADIONUCLIDE DISTRIBUTIONS; ARCTIC-OCEAN; FALLOUT RADIONUCLIDES; IRISH-SEA; PLUTONIUM; TRANSPORT; PU-240; WASHINGTON; SEAWATER; AM-241	Marine sediment cores were taken from Sagami Bay of the western Northwest Pacific and analyzed for Pu239+240 and Cs-137 activities. A significant correlation was observed between Pu239+240 and Cs-137 activities in sediment cores, i.e., their vertical profiles. The measured activities which were used to obtain the inventories of Pu239+240 and Cs-137 in the sediment column, shelved large variations, ranging from 36 to 474 MBq/km(2) for Pu239+240 and 49 to 652 MBq/km(2) for Cs-137. Pu239+240 inventories in the sediment from one region in the Bay, Sagami Nada were 5-10 times greater than those predicted from atmospheric global fallout 42 MBq/km(2) at the same latitude. On the other hand, Cs-137 inventories, With a mean value of 297+/-168 MBq/km(2), were much less than predicted, 2040 MBq/km(2). The activity ratios of Pu239+240/Cs-137 obtained, with a mean of 0.65+/-0.17, were significantly greater than the ratio predicted from fallout, 0.021. Furthermore, there was a clear relationship between both Pu239+240 and Cs-137 inventories and the water content, indicating that higher inventories may be attributed principally to concentration in, and scavenging by, fine-grained particles.

In addition, the radon (Rn-222) and thoron (Rn-220) alpha -activities per unit volume of the water samples were also determined. The influence of the water flow rate and altitude on the radon concentration of the water samples belonging to the piedmont of the Middle Atlas mountains was investigated. The hydraulic exchanges between the Middle Atlas water reservoirs and the Turonian aquifer of the neighbouring Tadla plain have been quantified. The results were compared with data given in literature.

Low level wastes (LLW) and intermediate level wastes (ILW) are generated in various facets of nuclear fuel cycle and have various chemical composition. A systematic study was carried out by using copper ferrocyanide and calcium phosphate precipitation methods for the removal of cesium and strontium, respectively. The supernatants were subjected to ultra filtration (UF) using a membrane having a pore size of 0.2 mum. The decontamination factors (DF) at 2 and 24-hour intervals with and without UF were estimated. The DF obtained was in the range of 200-300 far cesium and 200 for strontium with LLW solution which has chemical characteristics similar to ground water. Two hours of sealing is adequate for strontium before UF. In case of cesium there is no much change in the DF values by UF. However, the UF has helped in the solid - liquid separation as the flocks of copper ferrocyanide precipitate are feathery in nature. The effect of ionic strength and the presence of TBP on the removal efficiency of cesium and strontium have also been studied. DF are observed to be a function of ionic strength and are low in deionized water, in salt solutions containing 1 to 4M sodium nitrate and also in solutions of ILW. However, increasing the chemical dosing to two times of normal plant dosing has yielded a DF of about 200 for sodium nitrate solutions with respect to cesium removal. When the concentration of ammonium nitrate in the waste exceeds 0.1M, the DF reduces. Entrained TBP as well as soluble TBP reduces the removal efficiency of cesium. This paper deals with the experimental data and mechanism of the processes involved in the removal of cesium and strontium.
