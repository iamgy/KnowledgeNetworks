The [O-15]N2O formed during irradiation is selectively concentrated from the target effluent by adsorption on a zeolite during 150 s and subsequently released by rapid heating into a pulse with a full width at half maximum of 3.5 s. The radioactivity and specific radioactivity in the pulse amount to 4 MBq [O-15]N2O and 4.5 x 10(13) Bq/mol respectively with a radiochemical purity >99.95%. A tenfold higher specific radioactivity may be feasible at larger beam currents, It was shown that stable N2O was also formed during irradiation. Based on responses to variations in various parameters during irradiation and on analyses performed on the products, an explanation is given on the mechanisms of in-target [O-15]N2O and N2O formation, involving reaction of a particular excited state of O-3 with N-2.

J	Wang, TK; Peir, JJ				Wang, TK; Peir, JJ			An iterative approach for TRIGA fuel burn-up determination using nondestructive gamma-ray spectrometry	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article								The purpose of this work is to establish a method for evaluating the burn-up values of the rod-type TRIGA spent fuel by using gamma-ray spectrometry of the short-lived fission products Zr-97/Nb-97, I-132, and La-140. Fuel irradiation history is not needed in this method. Short-lived fission-product activities were established by reirradiating the spent fuels in a nuclear reactor. Based on the measured activities, U-235 burn-up values can be deduced by iterative calculations. The complication caused by Pu-239 production and fission is also discussed in detail. The burn-up values obtained by this method are in good agreement with those deduced from the conventional method based on long-lived fission products Cs-137, Cs-134/Cs-137 ratio and Ru-106/Cs-137 ratio.

The proces was studied by the methods of metallography and x-ray crystallographic analysis. The changes in the microstructure and phase composition of the alloys as a function of the temperature and holding time were indicated. The decomposition process was represented in the form of C-shaped diagrams of the isothermal transformation of the gamma(s) phase, which characterize the structural changes occurring in the aloy in the direction of the equilibrium state. It was found that the process occurs in stages. 6 figures, 7 references.

J	Pertuis, V				Pertuis, V			Surface contamination of spent fuel convoys - Resumption of transport in France	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Top Fuel 99 Meeting	SEP 14-19, 1999	AVIGNON, FRANCE					In France, 1998 was marked by transport of spent fuel from EDF plants being suspended and then resumed. From the time the first inspections were carried out by the Nuclear Installations Safety Directorate, in charge of monitoring radioactive and fissile material for civil use since June 1997 (Decrets n 97-710 et 97-715 du 11 juin 1997 relatifs aux attributions du ministre de l'economie des finances et de I'industrie et de Ia ministre de l'amenagement du territoire et de l'environnement), surface contamination was found in a high percentage of packages and/or wagons containing spent fuel. The different expert appraisals showed that this had consequences for the health of neither the public nor of workers. Aiming at the resumption of transport, EDF and Cogema presented to the Safety Authority a plan of action including the increase in monitoring (number of points and cross-checking by SCS-Qualitest), more widespread observance of good practices resulting from analyses by EDF and conclusions of its nuclear inspectorate and an improvement in radiological cleanliness in the area where casks are loaded. During the inspections carried old at EDF plants, the Nuclear Installations Safety Directorate verified the application of this plan. Several observations were, nevertheless, made regarding maintenance of equipment, failure to apply procedures on a corporate level and the traceability of certain operations. The measures taken to inform the public sufficiently were applied. The Nuclear Installations Safety Directorate is continuing its monitoring actions to ensure that all EDF plants adopt the best practices. However, the overall clean-up of EDF plants is a long-term operation. Finally, the Nuclear Installations Safety Directorate is continuing its monitoring of the different stages of spent fuel transport as well as other types of transport of radioactive materials associated with nuclear activities.

J	Kocher, A; Charmensat, P; Provost, JL				Kocher, A; Charmensat, P; Provost, JL			EDF advanced fuel management strategies for the next century	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Top Fuel 99 Meeting	SEP 14-19, 1999	AVIGNON, FRANCE					The French nuclear fleet represents 57 PWRs in operation, accounting for 80 per cent of France's total electricity production The performance achieved by EDF reactors, in terms of availability (82.6 per cent in 1997) and good cost control, have allowed to improve the nuclear Kwh cost by 2 per cent since 1992. The implementation of longer fuel cycles on the 1300MW reactors from 1996 has contributed to this improvement and, as competitiveness is one of the main challenges for EDF, improving core management strategies is still at the order of the day. With this aim, a thinking process has been initialed to evaluate the benefit brought by the use of a fuel assembly like ALLIANCE, the new fuel product developed by Framatome-Fragema and. FCF (Framatome Cogema Fuels) in close cooperation with EDF. The considered product provides enhanced performance, particularly sis regards discharge burnup (at least up to 70 GWd/t) and thermal-hydraulic and mechanical behaviour. Fuel management improvements rely on the expertise gained by Framatome through designing core managment strategies in a wide range of operating conditions prevailing in nuclear reactors all over the world. It will however be taken into account the necessity for EDF to adopt a policy of stepwise change owing to the potential impact of a "series effect" on its numerous units. The proposed paper will describe innovative fuel managements, achievable thanks to advanced fuel assembly performance, that are jointly investigated by EDF and Framatome. It includes the following optimization schemes : - extending cycle length by using higher enrichments up to 5 per cent, while keeping the same reload size (1/3 core for example for the 1300MW reactors) - decreasing reload size (from 1/3 to 1/4 core), while keeping the same cycle length, using more enriched (up to 5 per cent) fuel assemblies - reaching annual cycle, with maximization of fuel cycle cost optimization (1/5 core). Beyond such schemes, combinations of optimized loading patterns and neutronic features of the fuel assemblies will also be analyzed. These strategies will satisfy EDF's requirements: enable to reduce reactor vessel fluence and optimize the fuel cycle costs, thanks to very low leakage loading patterns associated with original burnable poison design, and a way of using fuel assemblies that contributes to minimize the fuel burnup dispersion.

J	Lamorlette, G; Comte, D				Lamorlette, G; Comte, D			Fifteen years of experience in the use of reprocessed uranium	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			English	Article								In 1983, a small batch of fuel obtained from LWR reprocessed uranium (REPU) was introduced in a German nuclear reactor. Since this starting point, the reprocessing plants have delivered more than 12000 tonnes of REPU. This amount will further grow in the years to come in a pace comparable to the output of a large uranium mine. In the meantime, the industry quietly put in place the facilities which were needed to take benefit of the material. This includes chemical conversion of REPU, enrichment, fuel fabrication and transport as well as reactor irradiation. Large scale recycling of REPU is now implemented albeit limited to a fraction of the available material and thus to a few numbers of reactors. Nevertheless, a significant operating experience is continuously accumulated by the industry in each step of the REPU fuel cycle. The impact of the chemical and isotopic peculiarities of REPU on the operation and maintenance conditions has been metered. Appropriate actions have been carried out in order to minimize this impact and to properly and safely run the concerned facilities and plants. Information available from different industrial sources is gathered and summarised. An assessment of the experience including the achievements and the issues still to be solved is given.

J	Jorda, M				Jorda, M			Geologic storage of high-level longlived radioactive waste - the situation of France	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			French	Article								After a first, failed attempt in the eighties to install underground test facilities in France, the French parliament passed legislation on December 30, 1991 on all activities relating to the treatment of high-level, longlived radioactive waste. Under that law, the national authority in charge of radioactive waste management, ANDRA, is commissioned to build and operate underground research facilities so as to enable government and parliament to decide, in 2006, about the feasibility of reversible or irreversible geologic storage. The Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique (CEA) is commissioned to study two other approaches: the segaration/conversion (transmutation) of radionuclides;, and the interim storage of waste above ground or on shallow land burial sites over a prolonged period of time. The law also provides for the establishment of a committee of scientists (National Evaluation Committee, CNE) to examine progress and consistency of the research work along these three lines by the year 2006. The Committee once a year submits to the government a report drafted on the basis of regular comments about the research activities it solicited from various participants in the research schemes. After appointing a Coordinator and establishing consensus on the spot, the government in January 1994 authorized the startup of preliminary exploratory work in four departements with favorable geologic conditions for underground storage: Haute-Marne, Meuse, Vienne, and Gard. Thanks to these activities, which were conducted between January 1994 and March 1996, the anticipated quality of the strata considered was confirmed, and it became possible to determine the sites on which an underground test facility might best be built. In mid-1996, three sets of documents, together with the application for a construction permit, were filed with the competent ministries for one site in Vienne and one each in Gard and Meuse (at the border with Haute-Marne), respectively. After examination of the documents in 1997 and 1998, and following approval of the three sites by the municipal and regional entities concerned, and also by the agencies responsible for public inquiries, the government decided on December 9, 1998 to authorize construction of a test facility on the site in the Meuse departement characterized by clayey soil, not pursue any further the clayey site in Gard, and instead examine the possibility to install an interim shallow land store in this departement, and request ANDRA to study another site in granite rock with a view to setting up another underground test facility there. The decisions about the test facility in the departement of Meuse, and the investigation of a new site in granite rock, were confirmed in a decree by the competent ministers on August 3, 1999. Along with the construction and subsequent operation of underground test facilities, ANDRA drafts a plan of stores adapted to specific sites. These plans are to be included with the documents on which the government, following a decision by CNE, is to take a decision in 2006.

J	Cazalet, J				Cazalet, J			Uranium enrichment by laser: A technology for the future	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Top Fuel 99 Meeting	SEP 14-19, 1999	AVIGNON, FRANCE					Even though the world enrichment market experiences disruptions which are both considerable and lasting the french approach is based on long term prospects: the aim is to have methods of enriching uranium at one's disposal which are autonomous and competitive in an environment of strong international competition. About fifteen years ago, the CEA decided to develop SILVA (Isotope Separation by Laser on the Atomic Vapour of Uranium) process, a process based on laser photo-ionization on the atomic vapour of uranium. This decision led to a significant research and development programme, led jointly by the CEA and the industrial operator COGEMA. SILVA uses the difference between the excitation frequencies of the electron layers (electronic transition) of uranium isotopes. The light emitted by a laser can be tuned to these frequencies, causing the excitation of the chosen isotope, in this case uranium 235. This excitation leads to the ionization of the atom: the ions are then separated by an electrical field and received by the dedicated collectors. This separation method is highly selective (achieving enrichment in only one step). The research programme really took off in the mid '80s, the scientific feasability being demonstrated in 1991. Since this date, a considerable number of results have been obtained both for the mastering of the process and in the form of technological breakthroughs. A special test has confirmed the suitability of SILVA physics for the enrichment of reprocessed uranium - SILVA enriches uranium 235 without increasing the content of even isotopes (such as 234, 236) which are undesirable in the production of fuel. The future programme will show the industrial operability of specific components (internal structures of the separator, lasers, optical components) and materials specific to SILVA.

J	Capus, G; Comte, D				Capus, G; Comte, D			Learning from nature, technologies and economics; COGEMA's strategic approach of the nuclear fuel cycle front-end	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			English	Article								Early next century the COGEMA Group will approach the twenty-fifth anniversary of its foundation. COGEMA was established in 1976 to supply the French park of nuclear power plants. In the meantime, the company has expanded its activities so as to include products and services supporting customers in running nuclear power plants. As the company's activities about the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle are probably better known than its capabilities and products associated with the front end of that cycle, it may be in order to consider that COGEMA and its subsidiaries are among the marker leaders in the fields of uranium mining, uranium conversion, and uranium enrichment. Contrary to predictions in the seventies, on which they had been based, uranium supply and nuclear fuel cycle services had to be adapted to a reduced requirement and to advanced technologies. In an environment like this, competitiveness is not only a precondition for survival in the market, but also helps utilities, in more and more deregulated markets, to support electricity generation in nuclear power plants in a fierce competition with other energy sources. Being a supplier, COGEMA feels obliged to pursue the sustainable generation of electricity in nuclear power plants, and seeks to maintain its competitiveness in the field also by paying attention to economic and technical risks associated with the supply of nuclear fuels in the long run. In uranium mining, COGEMA mainly tried to adapt production and the portfolio of resources to the changed realities of the market, moving towards low-cost operations. Decisions in this field typically must be taken fifteen or twenty years prior to an anticipated commissioning date. COGEMA's move to integrate into the market natural uruanium from Russian weapon programs expands its supply base and helps to remove long-term uncertainties of the natural uranium market. In the field of uranium conversion, COMURHEX holds a trump card in this currently rather narrow market segment thanks to its geographic and structural proximity to the mining and enrichment activities of COGEMA. Uranium enrichment is influenced a great deal by technical boundary conditions. COGEMA has secured a unique position, on the one hand, by running a gaseous diffusion plant in France and, at the same rime, by developing the centrifuge and laser technologies for potential further use. This strategy will not come as a surprise, given that a company characterized largely by its long-term worldwide commitment to uranium mining has learned to reconcile economic requirements with the peculiarities and whims of nature.

The expected improvements are now seen in detailed inspections, Hot Cell Post-irradiation Examinations (PIEs) of high burnup 10x10 fuel, proving very low fission gas release; and PCI free operation Liner fuel mitigates the risk for PCI failures during power ramp operation at higher burn-up. For protection against severe degradation it is necessary to have a liner that is not only mitigating PCI, but also has good corrosion properties, ABB has therefore developed the Zr-Sn liner, which is the only fully operational proven concept against PCI and long axial splits in the industry. Both steam tests of ABB's Zr-Sn liner and Rot Cell PIE of failed Zr-Sn liner fuel have confirmed a very low corrosion rate. To date, all the identified ABB 10x10 fuel failures have been due to debris fretting, except one single event of four failed six cycles fuel rods which were affected by ESSC (Enhanced Spacer Shadow Corrosion) during 1996-97. ESSC is now effectively remedied, which leaves only debris fretting as primary failure cause on ABB 10x10 fuel. ABB has now a very good understanding of the cause of primary failures and the generic fuel degradation mechanisms. Based on this understanding, ABB has developed effective remedies both against debris fretting and fuel rod degradation. These remedies include fretting resistant cladding, mitigating of debris hom the primary system and fuel assemblies, operation guide lines for operation with a primary leaker.

A reference event for ITER was postulated which was a failure of a penetration line (0.02 m(2) cross-section) into a room with stack ventilation. Behavior of ingress air and environmental release of the inventory were calculated by an accident analysis code (MELCOR). No in-vessel component cooling was assumed because of a non-safety system and 1350 g-T as tritium (HTO) and 30 kg as tokamak dust (tungsten) were set in the vacuum vessel (VV) as the initial mobile inventory. Operation of the maintenance detritiation system (MDS) after 1 h was credited to limit the release. The analytical results showed that the environmental release of tritium (19 g-T) from the stack was a factor of 5 below the accidental release limit for ITER, and the release of dust (21 g) from the stack is a factor of 25 below the release limit. To investigate the ultimate safety margin, a hypothetical event was also analyzed which was a failure of a penetration line (0.2 m(2) cross-section) into a room with ground level ventilation. Since the best estimate analysis assumed in-vessel cooling, which resulted in cooling down the walls, the mobile tritium inventory was reduced to 390 g-T. The large break size caused fast pressurization of the VV and thus the whole dust inventory (110 kg) was expected to be mobile. The ground level release was less than half of the no-evacuation limit under conservative weather conditions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

To provide experimental data of decay heat needed for validation of the design calculations, a systematic decay heat experiment was performed. Thirty-two fusion reactor relevant materials were irradiated by 14-MeV neutrons, and decay heat produced in the materials was measured by the Whole Energy Absorption Spectrometer in a cooling time period from 1 min to 400 days with typical experimental errors of 6-10%. Source neutron flux spectra at irradiation positions, which were needed for successive analyses, were determined. Lessons about sequential reactions. impurities, reactions induced by low energy neutrons and radiolysis which should be considered in activation analyses for fusion reactors were learned from the experimental analyses. The experimental data with the source neutron conditions are to be used for investigating the validity of decay heat calculation codes, activation cross section libraries and decay data libraries.

The principal neutron-activation reaction is O-16(n,p) N-16. Decay by beta emission (100%) of the 7.13 +/- 0.02 s N-16 activity is accompanied by production of energetic gamma rays (most of them with energies > 6 MeV) that are associated with the prompt radiative de-excitation of various elevated energy levels of O-16 populated through the process N-16(beta-) 16O. The dominant gamma-ray emission branch energies (intensities) are 6.129 MeV (67.0 +/- 0.6%) and 7.115 MeV (4.9 +/- 0.4%). A particular given intensity refers to the percent of 16N decays that produce the indicated gamma ray. Both photons possess energies that are above the photo-fission threshold for the naturally occurring isotopes of uranium, namely, (234)u, U-235, and U-238. This paper reports on an experiment that demonstrated 16N decay gamma-ray induced photo-fission in a commercial fission detector that contained 0.14 g of depleted uranium (predominantly U-238 With a Small trace of 235U). This detector was placed near a tubing system containing circulating water that had been activated by neutron bombardment as it passed near to the target of an intense D-T fusion neutron generator. The fission detector was situated in a shielded location remote from the source of primary D-T neutrons. Other possible mechanisms leading to the generation of the observed detector events were considered. Among these were natural background radiation (e.g., cosmic rays), delayed neutrons from the decay of N-17 and N-18 also produced in water by D-T neutrons, secondary neutrons from (gamma,a) reactions in materials near the detector, and electronic noise or pulse pileup. All of these alternative possibilities were ultimately rejected as significant contributors to the experimental detector counts by a detailed examination of the pertinent nuclear data and by specific measurements carried out in the present study. Photo-fission of U-238 remained as the predominant source of the recorded fission-detector events after elimination of these other possibilities as significant contributors of observed counts. The anticipated photo-fission yield was calculated based on consideration of the experimental setup, tabulated cross sections, and other pertinent nuclear data. This analysis yielded results which were found to be consistent with the present experimental observations to within the combined - rather large - uncertainties. This outcome further supports the conclusion that photo-fission events were indeed observed in this experiment. Some engineering implications of this investigation, and potential applications for the observed phenomenon in contemporary nuclear fusion technology. are also discussed.

J	Petti, D; McCarthy, K				Petti, D; McCarthy, K			Progress in US fusion safety and environmental activities over the last decade	FUSION TECHNOLOGY			English	Review						safety; environment; fusion	THERMONUCLEAR EXPERIMENTAL REACTOR; ITER SAFETY; PARTICLE-SIZE; TOKAMAK DUST; DESIGN; VERIFICATION; GENERATION; ACTIVATION; LIMITS	Magnetic fusion energy has the potential for superior safety and environmental (S&E) characteristics relative to other energy options, which is one of the main reasons for developing fusion power. Excellent progress has been made in understanding the nature of the SEE concerns associated with fusion power and in demonstrating the S&E potential effusion. Over the past 10 yr, U.S. fusion S&E activities have been largely focused on the international Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). The design of ITER is such that the hazards addressed are similar to those of a future fusion power plant; hence, many of the safety issues addressed by ITER are relevant to commercial fusion power plants. This paper reviews the progress and accomplishments infusion S&E activities performed largely in support of ITER over the past decade and discusses future directions in fusion safety design criteria development and implementation; characterization of the radioactive and hazardous materials in fusion and the potential energy sources that could mobilize those materials during an accident; integrated state-of-the-art safety and risk analysis took methods, and results; and development of environmental design criteria for radioactive and hazardous fusion waste minimization as well as the evaluation of recycle/reuse potential effusion materials.

J	Ebey, PS; Asaki, TJ; Hoffer, JK				Ebey, PS; Asaki, TJ; Hoffer, JK			A numeric study of the dependence of the surface temperature of beta-layered regions on absolute thickness	FUSION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						deuterium-tritium ice; beta-layering	IGNITION; TRITIUM; FUSION	Beta-layering of deuterium-tritium (D-T) ice in spherical shell geometries is numerically and analytically considered to investigate the relationship between temperature differences that arise because of inner-surface perturbations and the absolute shell thickness. The calculations use dimensions based on a proposed design of an inertial confinement fusion target for use at the National Ignition Facility. The temperature differences are calculated within D-T ice shells of varying total thicknesses, and the temperature differences calculated in three dimensions are compared both to the one-dimensional results and to the expected limits in three dimensions for long- and short-wavelength surface perturbations. The three-dimensional numeric results agree well with both the long- and short-wavelength limits; the region of crossover from short- to long-wavelength behavior is mapped out. Temperature differences due to surface perturbations are proportional to D-T layer thickness in one-dimensional systems but not in three-dimensional spherical shells. In spherical shells, surface perturbations of long wavelength give rise to temperature perturbations that are approximately proportional to the total shell thickness, while for short-wavelength perturbations, the temperature differences are inversely related to total shell thickness. In contrast to the one-dimensional result we find that in three dimensions there is not a general relationship between shelf thickness and surface temperature differences.

Therefore, infusion reactors, this method is expected to be applied for the helium glow discharge exhaust gas processing system and the blanket tritium recovery system. To design these systems, adsorption isotherms for each hydrogen isotope are needed, making it possible to estimate the amount of adsorption in a wide pressure range. The amount of tritium adsorption on molecular sieve 5A, molecular sieve 4A, and activated carbon, which are potential adsorbents in the cryosorption bed, at liquid nitrogen temperature were quantified using the volumetric method. It was found that adsorption isotherms of tritium were also expressed with the two-site Langmuir model and that the obtained isotherms were close to the reported isotherms, the Langmuir coefficients for which were estimated using a reduced mass of hydrogen isotopes.

J	Kawano, T; Sakuma, Y; Kabutomori, T; Shibuya, M				Kawano, T; Sakuma, Y; Kabutomori, T; Shibuya, M			Development of a tritium cleanup system for a large helical device using nonvolatile getter materials	FUSION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						methane decomposition; tritium process; getter material	HTO REDUCTION; ALLOY	A tritium cleanup system has been conceptually developed for the large helical device (LHD) at the National Institute for Fusion Science. The system is a processing device employed to remove tritium from exhaust gas. In the exhaust gas discharged from the LHD in normal operation, the major part of tritium constituents should be in a form of hydrogen molecules because the fuel used in plasma experiments with the LHD is hydrogen molecules. From this viewpoint we have designed a tritium cleanup system, which is characterized by tritium being removed and stored in a form of hydrogen molecules with less impurities, like oxygen and carbon, and its decomposition and the separation processes are introduced to convert various tritiated compounds into a form of hydrogen molecules of high purity. Besides these, there is another aspect in that getter materials are applied in both decomposition of tritiated compounds and storage of hydrogen molecules containing tritium. The system design is composed of three essential component parts: a hydrogen separator, a hydrogen absorbing vessel, and a decomposition process vessel. The hydrogen separator and the decomposition process vessel make a process loop repeat to remove hydrogen into a form of hydrogen molecules with less impurities. It is important that "less impurities" means having a less bad influence on hydrogen-absorbing materials used in the storage vessel. We think that the hydrogen separator will be manufactured by employing a palladium hydrogen purifier system, which is available in the marketplace, and the hydrogen storage vessel will also be manufactured by using hydrogen-absorbing alloys like titanium. Thus, the serious problem imposed on us is how to realize the decomposition process vessel. To develop the decomposition process vessel, we thought nonvolatile getter materials were promising and carried out performance tests of methane decomposition by the nonvolatile getter materials, where methane was used because it is hardly decomposed and there is little data for a flowing-gas system. The tritium cleanup system that was designed is presented. Also, a methane decomposition curve with ZrNi alloys used as one of the typical nonvolatile getter materials is shown, and the probability of the realization of the decomposition process vessel is examined.

J	Housiadas, C; Perujo, A				Housiadas, C; Perujo, A			The effect of pulse operation on tritium permeation and inventory in ITER's plasma-facing components	FUSION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						tritium; ITER; permeation; inventory		The estimation of tritium inventories and permeation fluxes to the coolant in the international Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is an important issue from the safety standpoint. Previous calculations have been performed neglecting ITER's pulse operation because it was assumed that during plasma-off periods the processes become "frozen" until the plasma starts again. It is shown that this assumption may fail in certain cases, particularly in the first wall of ITER, where a larger (by an order of magnitude) inventory and permeation flux to the coolant is obtained when pulse operation is considered. The calculations are performed with the code TMAP4. The discontinuous nature of the plasma operation is mimicked by imposing on the plasma-facing side a heat flux and a particle implantation flux in the form of a quadratic stepwise periodic function oscillating between zero (plasma off) and a maximum value (plasma on).

J	Trivedi, A; Galeriu, D; Lamothe, ES				Trivedi, A; Galeriu, D; Lamothe, ES			Dose contribution from metabolized organically bound tritium after chronic tritiated water intakes in humans	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						tritium; dosimetry; nuclear workers exposure, occupational	DOSIMETRY	Our earlier study of acute, tritiated water intakes in humans has demonstrated that the dose contribution from metabolized organically bound tritium is less than 10% of the body water dose, To further demonstrate that the dose contribution from the organically bound tritium per unit intake of tritiated water is the same, regardless of whether the intake is acute (all at once) or chronic (spread over time), urine samples from six male radiation workers with chronic tritiated water intakes were collected and analyzed for tritium, These workers have a well-documented dose history and a well-controlled tritium bioassay database, providing assurance that their tritium intakes were in the form of tritiated water, Each month for a full calendar year, urine samples were collected front each exposed worker. The monthly concentration of tritium-in-urine for each exposed worker was no lower than 10(4) Bq L-1 but no higher than 10(5) Bq L-1. These urine samples were analyzed for tritiated water and organically bound tritium to determine the ratio of these tritiated species in urine. The average ratio of tritiated water to organically bound tritium in urine for each exposed worker was 330 +/- 129 (range, 297-589), To calculating the dose to these workers, we assumed that, under steady-state conditions, the ratio of the specific activity of tritium (H-3 activity per gH) in the organic matter and water fractions of urine is representative of the ratio of the specific activity of tritium in the organic matter and water fractions of soft tissue. A mathematical model was developed and used to estimate the dose increase from the metabolized organically bound tritium based on the ratio of tritiated water to organically bound tritium in urine, The resulting average dose from the organically bound tritium was 6.9 +/- 3.1% (range, 4.7-9.9%) of the body water dose for the six male workers, and agrees well with the value obtained from our acute tritiated water intakes study in humans. The observed dose contribution from organically bound tritium, relative to body water dose, is in agreement with current recommendations of assigning 10 % of total body water dose for organically bound tritium in soft tissues after tritiated water intakes.

The ranges of Th-232 activity concentrations (mBq per gram of wet tissue) were 0.17-94 in lungs, 3.9-1210 in pulmonary lymph nodes, 0.14-1.19 in bones, 0.015-0.68 in liver, 0.97-5.8 in spleen, and 0.009-0.068 in kidneys. These concentrations are 10 to 1,000 times greater than have been reported for persons not occupationally exposed to thorium. In most of the samples, the ratios of Th-228 to Th-232 and Th-230 to Th-232 activity at death of the subject were 0.2-0.4 and 0.1-0.2, respectively. Th-228 to Ra-228 activity ratios (+/- standard errors) of 0.86 +/- 0.11 in lungs and 1.18 +/- 0.13 in lymph nodes of one subject were obtained by calculation from ratios of Th-228 to Th-232.

J	Zanzonico, PB				Zanzonico, PB			Age-dependent thyroid absorbed doses for radiobiologically significant radioisotopes of iodine	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						radioisotope; iodine; dose, absorbed; thyroid	CHERNOBYL ACCIDENT; CANCER; SOFTWARE; SAAM	In light of the post-Chernobyl increase in pediatric thyroid cancer incidence, among other recent events, there Is renewed interest in radioiodine thyroid dosimetry and effects, Among the radioiodines produced in fission of U-235, only [(T-1/2)(p) = 8.04 d ], I-132 (2.3 h), I-133 (20.3 h), and I-135 (6.7 h) may undergo significant environmental dispersion. Age-dependent thyroid absorbed dose estimates for these radiobiologically significant radioiodines and for the "medical" radioisotopes I-123 (13.2 h) and I-125 (60 d) have been derived, incorporating the effect of absorption following inhalation or ingestion. This effect has generally been ignored in previously derived estimates of radioiodine absorbed doses to the thyroid. Based on the latest ICRP lung and gut models, inhaled radioiodine is absorbed at a rate of 0.175 h(-1) and exhaled at 0.101 to 0.118 h(-1) (depending on age) and ingested radioiodine is completely absorbed in the stomach at a rate of 1 h(-1). Whole-body compartmental models (SAAM II) were fit to previously published 24-h thyroid uptakes, thyroid half-times, and 48-h plasma concentration of protein-bound iodine. The resulting fitted models were used to calculate thyroid residence times of radioiodine. The mean thyroid absorbed doses [cGy/37 kBq (rad/mu Ci) injected intravenously] were then calculated using the age-dependent S(thyroid<--thyroid) factors (MIRDOSE III), with the highest doses (from 0.49 for I-123 to 36 for I-131) in newborns and the lowest doses (from 0.014 for I-123 to 1.4 for I-131) in adults in inverse relation to the thyroid mass. Although the thyroid absorbed dose for inhalation is substantially (30 to 70%) less than that for injection for all radioiodines and at all ages, if is markedly (25%) less for ingestion only for short-lived I-132.

The hypothesis was tested that adsorbed tritiated water is diluted by isotopic exchange with both non-tritiated water and hydroxyl groups within the silica gel matrix, The extent of dilution was measured from 4% to 14% adsorbed water, which is typical of moisture on field collectors for monitoring airborne tritium oxide. For this range of percent adsorbed water, the inferred percent exchangeable water in the silica gel under study was 6.3 +/- 0.1%. This value compares to the silica gel weight loss of 5.3% after heating to 1,050 degrees C. An explanation of the difference between 6.3% and 5.3% is proposed. The contribution of the HTO/H2O vapor pressure isotope effect was considered in calculating isotopic exchange. A curve is presented for correcting the measured tritium concentration in the distillate from the silica gel as a function of the amount of adsorbed water. The tritium tracer procedure is recommended fur determining the percent exchangeable water in other silica gels to correct tritium measurements of water vapor collected by them.

Monodisperse aerosols in the size range of 70 to 500 mo were generated with Carnauba wax by means of the evaporation-condensation method. The temperature and the relative humidity in the chamber were set at 20 degrees C and 20%, respectively, throughout the entire experiment. When the aerosols were being injected into the chamber, both the number size distribution and the activity-weighted size distribution of attached radon progeny were stable. The activity-weighted size distribution was compared with the attachment rate distribution obtained by measuring the number size distribution with the SMPS and multiplying the size-dependent attachment coefficient. There was a relatively good agreement between the two distributions.

J	Vargas, A; Ortega, X; Porta, M				Vargas, A; Ortega, X; Porta, M			Dose conversion factor for radon concentration in indoor environments using a new equation for the F-f(p) correlation	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						effective dose; radioactivity, natural; radon progeny; dose assessment	EQUILIBRIUM	Since 1994 the radon studies group at the Institut de Tecniques Energetiques (INTE) of the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya in Barcelona, Spain, has carried out a campaign of continuous measurements of the equilibrium factor (F) and the unattached fraction (f(p)) of radon decay products at four sites which are representative of different environmental characteristics on the Mediterranean littoral of Catalonia, Spain. IL has been established that these parameters vary widely, F(0.03-0.87) and f(p) (0-0.72), from one site to another and with time, according to the characteristics of the site and climate. In spite of this variation, the F and f(p) parameters are log-normally or normally distributed. The measurements of F and f(p) show that f, is negatively correlated to F by a log-power equation, Ln(1/f(p))= 1.90[Ln(1/F)](-0.68), which can be used in all Che F range, instead of the commonly used power equation f(p) = aF(b) suggested by Stranden and Strand and other authors, which fits well for a reduced range off. Power and log-power equations have been introduced into a simplified dosimetric model in order to estimate the effective dose per unit radon exposure as a function of F. From the log-power equation this value is quite constant and ranged from 9 nSv per Bq m(-3) h to 12 nSv per Bq m(-3) h when F is higher than 0.15. In the ease of a lower F factor, a linear function that passes through 0 fits quite well. A value of 12 nSv per Bq m(-3) h is proposed for the Mediterranean littoral of Catalonia as the best estimation.

Soil contamination on the family farm seems to be the main source of human contamination because most of the people in the area live on small farms and they and their domestic animals eat crops from the farms. A clear correlation was found between the children's whole-body Cs-137 counting results and the radioactivity in their food (correlation coefficient: 0.76; confidence level of correlation: 3.2 x 10(-9)). There were also significant correlations between the whole-body Cs-137 counting results and both the radioactivity of the soil samples (correlation coefficient: 0.22; confidence level of correlation: 0.0107) and the average contamination level of their current residence (correlation coefficient: 0.20; confidence level of correlation: 0.0174).

Materials and methods: Neutron-induced and alpha-track autoradiographs were prepared from femora of the CBA/H mouse that had been injected with 40 kBq kg(-1) radionuclide between 1 and 448 days previously. Computer-based image analysis of the autoradiographs was performed and dosimetric methods applied to obtain radiation dose-rates to different regions of the marrow cavity. Results: Initially each radionuclide deposited on endosteal and periosteal hone surfaces; Am-241 was additionally deposited on vascular canal surfaces. Redistribution resulted in U-233 being incorporated into bone, while Pu-239 and Am-241 showed transfer into both bone volume and marrow. Accumulation in the central marrow peaked at 112-224 days post-injection, but subsequently was cleared by 448 days. Cumulative doses to both osteosarcomagenic and myeloid leukaemogenic target cell regions showed the trend Pu-239 > Am-241 > U-233. Conclusions: Calculation of cumulative doses to a 10-mu m layer of marrow adjacent to bone surfaces appears to be a suitable predictor for risk of osteosarcoma. Risks of myeloid leukaemia in the mouse are better predicted by considering the central marrow as the target region rather than average dose to all marrow.

Materials and methods: Two experiments were performed, one with simultaneous injection of neptunium and LIHOPO at dosages ranging from 3 to 200 mu mol kg(-1) and the other with delayed administration of LIHOPO 30 mu mol kg(-1) from 5 min to 30 min after Np injection. Results: The data obtained after simultaneous injections showed that the ligand dosage effectiveness was not linear and depended on the tissues being considered. For bones, the best results were obtained with 200 mu mol kg(-1) LIHOPO, where retention was reduced to 11% of controls. Maximum efficacies for removal in liver and kidney were obtained with 30 mu mol kg(-1) LIHOPO, where retention was reduced to 39% and 1.6% of controls, respectively. Ar higher dosages, LIHOPO seemed to have a reverse effect on these tissues, demonstrated by a significant accumulation of the radionuclide. The delayed administration of LIHOPO dramatically decreased its efficacy. When administered 5 min after Np, LIHOPO was still efficient (60%, 37%, 7% of controls in bone, liver, kidneys, respectively) but not when treatment was delayed to 30 min. Conclusions: These results demonstrated that LIHOPO was able to complex Np at the wound site but nor after translocation to blood.

Detailed XPS scans of the main photoelectron peaks (U 4f, Cs 3d, O 1s and valence band) were made. Peak positions, peak widths and satellite positions were measured and compared between the uranates. A systematic shift in the position of the U 4f lines was found to be correlated with the Cs/U ratio. The mixed valency behaviour of uranium was observed and studied. Interpretation of the satellite structure of the U 4f peaks and the deconvolution of these peaks have been used to quantify the chemical states of uranium present in the mixed valency compound Cs2U4O12 (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Kourti, N; Shepherd, I				Kourti, N; Shepherd, I			Modelling intergranular fuel swelling in severe accidents	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							FISSION-GAS RELEASE; BUBBLE DIFFUSION; GRAIN-BOUNDARIES; UO2; BURNUP; GROWTH	Fuel swelling during severe accidents in PWRs is considered to be insignificant for both core degradation behaviour and fission gas release. For this reason it is ignored by the major system codes, while the complementary process of fission gas release is treated as a simple diffusion from a sphere. Recent experiments showed that fuel swelling might accelerate core degradation, and the retention of fission gases might lead to burst release in later accident phases. Modelling of swelling has been confined to full mechanistic bubble behaviour modelling (microscopic modelling), which is not suitable for the major plant codes because of its high CPU consumption. In this paper a simple analytic model based on macroscopic observations will be presented. This model uses gas diffusion from a spherical grain model for the gas atom flux into the grain boundaries, and vacancy diffusion from the pellet surface model for the vacancy flux to the grain boundaries. The total vacancy volume and the gas atom number are coupled by the Xe-equation of state. The gas release or fuel swelling is then pressure controlled. The model gave good results for both release and swelling when compared with experimental observations. This made clear that the application of the gas diffusion model alone is not enough to describe the fission product release. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Veshchunov, MS				Veshchunov, MS			On the theory of fission gas bubble evolution in irradiated UO2 fuel	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							RELEASE; NUCLEATION; MODEL	The standard approaches for modelling of the intra- and intergranular bubbles evolution in the UO2 fuel are critically analysed on the basis of available experimental data. It is demonstrated that the main disadvantage of the simplified treatment of the problem by the standard models can be associated with underestimation of the radiation effects at low temperatures (below 1500 degrees C) and thermal effects at high temperatures (above 1500 degrees C). The presented analysis allows a quantitative description of the bubble nucleation mechanism, adequate modelling of the bubble diffusion growth, and evaluation of the intragranular bubble number density and stable size attained under steady irradiation conditions.

J	Lebihan, T; Rogl, P; Noel, H				Lebihan, T; Rogl, P; Noel, H			The niobium-silicon-uranium system	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							MAGNETIC-BEHAVIOR; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE	Phase relations in the ternary system Nb-Si-U were established for the isothermal sections at 1000 degrees C and 850 degrees C. Experimental techniques used were optical microscopy, X-ray microanalyser (XMA) and X-ray powder analysis of are melted samples which were annealed at 1000 degrees C for 144 h and/or at 850 degrees C for 300 h. Phase equilibria are characterised by the formation of two ternary compounds. Rietveld X-ray and neutron powder data refinements confirmed the stoichiometric behaviour for U2Nb3Si4, and established isotypism with the ordered Zr5Si4-type (Sc2Re3Si4-type). The second phase, U2-xNb3+xSi4,x similar or equal to 0.25, crystallises in the partially ordered Sm5Ge4-type (Ce2Sc3Si4-type). At 1000 degrees C both compounds form a narrow two-phase equilibrium. Due to the established two-phase equilibria: gamma-(U, Nb) + U2Nb3Si4 and Nb5Si3 + gamma-(U,Nb) there is no compatibility between U3Si2 and niobium metal at 1000 degrees C and at 850 degrees C, respectively. U2Nb3Si4 is weakly ferromagnetic below T-c similar or equal to 35 K. The remanence of only 0.0088 mu(B)/U atom probably results from a non-linear antiferromagnetic structure, too weak to be discovered by neutron powder diffraction. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Tf the amount of tritium trapped to the surface is not small enough compared to the amount of tritium introduced to the system, interactions of tritium with the system materials affect the behavior of tritium in a manner peculiar to the system. This phenomenon has been named as the system effect of tritium by the present authors and the way to quantify this effect using the serial reactors model, connection of perfect mixed type reactors and plug flow type reactors, also has been proposed. The tritium trapping capacity on the surface of stainless steel, copper or aluminum is quantified in this study considering that the surface water consists of physically adsorbed water, chemically adsorbed water and structural water. It is observed in this study that the amount of surface water on each material in this study gives non-negligible tritium trapping capacity and that the structural water controls the tritium trapping capacity when the vapor pressure is low or when temperature is high. Further phenomenal discussion from the viewpoint of material science is required because the interaction of tritium with material surface is observed to be highly dependent on the surface condition.

J	Sali, SK; Sampath, S; Venugopal, V				Sali, SK; Sampath, S; Venugopal, V			Thermal studies on alkaline earth uranates	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							SOLID-SOLUTION; OXIDATION; STATE	The thermal stabilities of various alkaline earth uranates were investigated by thermogravimetry and X-ray powder diffraction. New uranates with the formal composition A(2)U(3)O(9) (A = Ca, Sr and Ba) having hexagonal unit cell were obtained and characterised. Oxidation of these uranates led to the formation of two new intermediate compounds of composition A(2)U(3)O(10) (A = Ca and Sr). Many of the calcium and strontium uranates were found to be structurally related to fluorite as long as the substitution of uranium by calcium or strontium was limited to 0.33 and the ratio of oxygen to metal was close to 2. Kinetic studies on the oxidation and the reduction of uranates showed that the oxidation kinetics of A(2)U(3)O(9) to A(2)U(3)O(10) (A = Ca, Sr) or A(2)U(3)O(11) (A = Ba was controlled by nucleation and growth whereas the reduction kinetics of A(2)U(3)O(11) to A(2)U(3)O(9) (A = Ca, Sr and Ba), generally occurring in single step, was controlled by phase boundaries.

A salt and metal as solvents. Li as reductant and chlorine gas can be recycled in the process. The process is expected to generate less secondary radioactive waste because of no irradiation damage of the solvents, and to require a relatively compact installation because of larger critical mass in comparison with a conventional aqueous method. In this study, the material balance of the solutes and the volume of the solvents were estimated in the pyrometallurgical partitioning process that was constructed on the basis of our previous study. The results show that the volume of the salt as solvent is about 200 l and that of Cd, Bi and Pb as metal solvent is 54. 71 and 140 l, respectively, in the case that HLLW from PUREX reprocessing of It LWR spent fuel is treated in the process. The results also show that the amount of Li in the waste salt disposed from the process is kept less than the amount of Li2O needed for glass matrix.

The adsorption performances of various adsorbents for Kr were investigated at 195 and 273 K. The effect of nitrogen carrier gas on the adsorption of Kr was examined as well. Some carbon-based adsorbents-Ambersorb 572, Ryujyo-Sirasagi G2x4/6-3 and Molsievon X2M4/6-were found to have large adsorption capacities. The H-mordenite adsorbent fabricated from a natural mordenite by ion-exchange with the HCl solution was found to have a good adsorption performance for Kr, which is almost comparable to that of the activated charcoal.

These developments have revitalized the entire field of nuclear chemistry and physics. and have provided useful probes for such areas as nuclear astrophysics and condensed matter physics. There are also applications of these new beams in the areas of nuclear medicine and radiopharmacology that have not been mentioned. In many ways, with the start of the next millennium, it is clear that the study of the nucleus is still as important area of research as it was at the start of this century. There are important questions that need to be answered and these new probes represents a first step towards finally addressing these questions in a meaningful fashion.

J	Griffin, HC				Griffin, HC			Chemical challenges in the study of natural radioactive chains	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								Natural radioactivity was first confirmed by chemical means, and for many years it was the only known form of radioactivity. Chemical techniques remain necessary for obtaining samples of series components on which detailed studies can be made. These techniques must contend with features peculiar to or emphasized in the natural decay series-low specific activities of long-lived parents and trace quantities of short-lived intermediates, interferences from carriers (isotopic or non-isotopic), and rapid growth of impurities in initially pure fractions. Examples of each of these features (challenges) are given.	Univ Michigan, Dept Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA	Griffin, HC (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.

J	Hahn, RL				Hahn, RL			The physics and radiochemistry of solar neutrino detectors: What have we learned and what can we expect?	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							SUPER-KAMIOKANDE; GALLEX; OSCILLATIONS; FLUX	The situation in solar neutrino science has changed drastically in the past decade, with results now available from five neutrino experiments that use different methods to look at different regions of the solar-neutrino energy-spectrum. While the goal of all of these experiments is physics, they all rely heavily on chemistry and radiochemistry. Three of these experiments are radiochemical, the Cl-37 detector and the two different forms of Ga-71 detectors used in GALLEX and SAGE are based on the chemical isolation and counting of the radioactive products of neutrino interactions. The other two. Kamiokande and its improved successor, Super- Kamiokande, detect neutrinos in real time; however, they also depend sensitively on radiochemistry in that (as in all the solar neutrino detectors) radioactive contaminants must be controlled at very low levels, it is noteworthy that all of these experiments (a) have detected solar neutrinos, but (b) all repel? deficits of the observed neutrinos relative to the predictions of standard solar models - the so-called "solar neutrino problem". In this paper, I review the basic principles of operation of these neutrino detectors, report their recent results, and discuss some of the interpretations that are now in vogue. I then describe some of the new neutrino detectors that are under construction or being developed, and discuss the kinds of new results we might expect to see in the early years of the new millennium.
