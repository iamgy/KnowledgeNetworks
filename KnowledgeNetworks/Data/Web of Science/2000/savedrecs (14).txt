J	Merrill, BJ				Merrill, BJ			Modeling an unmitigated quench event in an ITER toroidal field magnet	FUSION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								An unmitigated quench of a toroidadfield (TF) magnet has been proposed as an extremely unlikely event for International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) Engineering Design Activity safety analysis. While the frequency of such an event is highly improbable (<1 x 10(-6)/yr), the public safety consequences of this event must be explored because the TF magnets are located midway between the two primary confinement barriers of the ITER design. These confinement barriers are the vacuum vessel (VV) and the cryostat. An unmitigated quench has the potential for producing melting of the magnet. If molten material from the magnet were to impinge on the walls of the VV and cryostat, these walls could fail, resulting in a pathway for release of radioactive material to the environment from the VV; A model has been developed at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory called MAGARC to investigate the consequences of this accident. This model is described in detail, and results from this model used in ITER safety analysis are presented.

Efficacy and toxicity of tetradentate catecholate and hydroxypyridinonate ligands in mice	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						chelation; uranium; kidneys; mice	IN-VIVO CHELATION; SEQUESTERING AGENTS; URANYL-NITRATE; ACTINIDES; RAT; INTOXICATION; PU-238(IV); RETENTION; REMOVAL; PU(IV)	Uranium(VI) (UO22+, uranyl) is nephrotoxic. Depending on isotopic composition and dosage, U(VI) is also chemically toxic and carcinogenic in bone. Several ligands containing two, three, or four bidentate catecholate or hydroxypyridinonate metal binding groups, developed for in vivo chelation of other actinides, were found, on evaluation in mice, to be effective far in vivo chelation of U(TI). The most promising ligands contained two bidentate groups per chelator molecule (tetradentate) attached to linear 4- or 5-carbon backbones (4-LI, butylene; 5-LI, pentylene; 5-LIO, diethyl ether). New ligands were then prepared to optimize ligand affinity for U(VI) in vivo and low acute toxicity. Five bidentate binding groups-sulfocatechol [CAM(S)], carboxycatechol [CAM(C)], methylterephthalamide (MeTAM), 1,2-hydroxypyridinone (1,2-HOPO), or 3,2- hydroxypyridinone (Me-3,2-HOPO)-were each attached to two linear backbones (4-LI and 5-LI or 5-LIO), Those ten tetradentate ligands and octadentate 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO), an effective actinide chelator, were evaluated in mice for in vivo chelation of U-233(VI) (injection at 3 min, 1 h, or 24 h or oral administration at 3 min after intravenous injection of (UO2Cl2)-U-233) and for acute toxicity (100 mu mol kg(-1) injected daily for 10 d), The combined efficacy and toxicity screening identified 5-LIO(Me-3,2-HOPO) and 5-LICAM(S) as the most effective low-toxicity agents. They chelate circulating U(VI) efficiently at ligand:uranium molar ratios greater than or equal to 20, remove useful amounts of newly deposited U(VI) from kidney and bone at molar ratios greater than or equal to 100, and reduce kidney U(VT) levels significantly when given orally at molar ratios greater than or equal to 100. 5-LIO(Me-3,2-HOPO) has greater affinity for kidney U(VI) while 5-LICAM(S) has greater affinity for bone U(VI), and a 1:1 mixture (total molar ratio = 91) reduced kidney and bone U(VI) to 15 and 58% of control, respectively-more than an equimolar amount of either ligand alone.

J	Peterson, SR; Davis, PA				Peterson, SR; Davis, PA			Modeled concentrations in rice and ingestion doses from chronic atmospheric releases of tritium	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						tritium; ingestion; modeling, dose assessment; emissions, atmospheric	FALLOUT H-3 INGESTION; VEGETATION; PLANTS; AKITA; JAPAN; AIR	The expansion of nuclear power programs in Asia has stimulated interest in the improved modeling of concentrations of tritium in rice, a staple crop grown throughout the far east. Normally the specific activity model is used to calculate concentrations of tritium in the tissue mater of edible plants to assess ingestion dose from chronic releases, However, because rice, like other grains, has much lower water content than most crops, the calculation must also account for organically bound tritium, This paper reviews ways to calculate steady-state concentrations of tritium in rice, including the methods of Canadian and United States regulatory models, and the assumptions behind them. Concentrations in rice and resulting ingestion doses are compared for the various methods, and equations for calculating concentrations are recommended. The regulatory models underestimate doses received from ingestion of rice contaminated with tritium since they do not account explicitly for organically bound tritium, The importance of including organically bound tritium is illustrated in a comparison of doses from rice, leafy vegetables and milk for an Asian diet. Dose factors from tritium for these foods are estimated to be 135, 47, and 20 nSv y(-1)/(Bq m(-3)), respectively. Assuming known air concentrations, tritium concentrations in rice, calculated with the recommended equations, are uncertain by less than a factor 2 when tritium concentrations in the rice paddy mater are known, and by less than a factor of 2.3 when concentrations in paddy mater are unknown.

Significant worker and population exposure occurred as a result of failures in the technological processes in the late 1940's and early 1950's. Members of the public were exposed via discharge of about 10(17) Bq of liquid wastes into the Techa River during 1949-1956, an explosion in the radioactive waste-storage facility in 1957, and gaseous aerosol releases within the first decades of the facility's operation. Residents of many villages downstream on the Techa River were exposed via a variety of pathways; the more significant included drinking of water from the river and external gamma exposure due to proximity to sediments and shoreline, The specific aim of this project is to enhance the reconstruction of external and internal radiation doses for individuals in the Extended Techa River Cohort. The purpose of this paper is to present the details of the methods that are being used in this enhanced dose-reconstruction effort and to provide example and representative results of the calculations, The methods of dose assessment currently being developed for the exposed population [termed the Techa River Dosimetry System-2000 (TRDS-2000)], which are a significant improvement on past methods (TRDS-1996), are presented. The new TRDS-2000 doses from the ingestion of radionuclides are substantially higher for the gastrointestinal tract, due to consideration of short-lived radionuclides, The TRDS-2000 doses from external exposure are substantially lower due to improvements in several factors. Assessment of uncertainty and validation of the "new" doses are significant issues currently under investigation.

J	Classic, KL; Knutson, AH; Smith, GD				Classic, KL; Knutson, AH; Smith, GD			Radiation safety role in institutional disaster planning	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topics; accident analysis; radiation protection; operational safety		United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) materials license applicants (non-nuclear power) must submit spill procedures with their application. While our counterparts in the nuclear power industry historically have concerned themselves with disaster drills and evacuation plans as a result of fire, explosion, or an act of terrorism,other licensees are looking only at minor spills of unsealed radioactive material and only at the radiation hazard. Beyond NRC regulations, various oversight and accrediting organizations require, or at a minimum encourage, a written disaster plan outlining actions to be taken for events likely to occur in the region of the institution. Some of these organizations require drills to practice implementation of the written plan. On 5 May 1999, Mayo Clinic performed a wide-scale disaster drill involving Rochester City and Olmsted County response organizations, and several Mayo Clinic departments. Planning took several months; the drill took approximately three hours. Participants gathered at several meetings post-drill for "debriefing" sessions to discuss successes, areas for improvement, and lessons learned. There were three overriding lessons learned: critical responders need special identification to allow access to the disaster site; initial victim surveys are for gross contamination only; and access to the potentially contaminated disaster site might fake weeks or months following a real event.

J	Karam, PA				Karam, PA			Apparent high tritium intake by a radiation worker at the University of Rochester	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topics; occupational safety; dose assessment; tritium		On 20 September 1999, a urine sample submitted by a University of Rochester radiation worker was noted to have a count rate of about 759,500 disintegrations per minute (dpm) per milliliter as analyzed on the Radiation Safety Unit (RSU)Packard liquid scintillation counter. The sample was recounted that day with variable results but each time indicating several hundred thousand dpm of activity present Calculations indicated this corresponded to a whole-body uptake of about 518 MBq (14 mCi) and a whole-body nose of about 10 mSv (1 rem). An investigation indicated it was unlikely for these analytical results to indicate an actual uptake of tritium and suggested the results were most likely die to chemical luminescence in the sample. Accordingly, no dose was assigned to this worker from this exposure.

J	Busker, G; Grimes, RW; Bradford, MR				Busker, G; Grimes, RW; Bradford, MR			The diffusion of iodine and caesium in the UO2 +/- x lattice	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							FISSION-PRODUCTS; UO2	The migration activation enthalpies of caesium and iodine in UO2+/-x predicted using atomistic simulation methodology, depend greatly on fuel stoichiometry. The mechanisms for stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric fuel require uranium self-diffusion, with the exception of iodine in UO2-x which employs an anion vacancy mechanism. The iodine post-irradiation results compare very well with the predicted activation enthalpy. In-pile iodine release experiments suggest a reduced activation enthalpy for iodine migration. The diffusion model presented allows for this result if uranium diffusion were greatly affected by the irradiation conditions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The onset of salt occlusion by the zeolite has been detected at 450 K. Evidence of a reaction between zeolitic water and uranium trichloride, leading to the formation of uranium dioxide, has appeared at 600 K. The uranium dioxide particle size increases from 2 nm at 600 K to 25 nm at 900 K - an indication of their extra-zeolitic location. No appreciable degradation of the zeolite structure has been observed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The enthalpy increment values were least squares analyzed with the constraints that H-0(T) - H-0(298.15 K) at 298.15 K equals zero and C-p.m(0)(298.15 K) equals 1064.2 and 301.8 J K(-1)mol(-1) for Sr3U11O36(s) and Sr3U2O9(s), respectively. The dependence of enthalpy increments with temperature can be given as H-0(T) - H-0(298.15 K) (J mol(-1)) = -304152 + 962.72T (K) + 177.63 x 10(-3)T(2) (K) + 3.954 x 10(-5)/T (K), (Sr3U11O36(s) 299.0 less than or equal to T (K) less than or equal to 1000), H-0(T) - H-0(298.15 K) (J mol(-1)) = -1 15 817 + 319.18T (K) + 58.01 x 10(-3)T(2) (K) + 46.201 x 10(5)/T (K), (Sr3U2O9(s),299.0 less than or equal to T (K) less than or equal to 1000). Thermodynamic functions for Sr3U11O36(s) and Sr3U2O9(s), have been generated using the Delta(r)H(m)(0)(298.15 K), Delta(r)G(m)(0)(T) and S-m(0)(298.15 K) values, either calculated in this study or from the literature.

J	Sunder, S; Miller, NH				Sunder, S; Miller, NH			XPS and XRD studies of (Th,U)O-2 fuel corrosion in water	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							SIMFUEL DISSOLUTION; DISPOSAL CONDITIONS; UO2	Dissolution and corrosion of (Th,U)O-2 fuel was investigated at room temperature and near 100 degrees C in near neutral and acidic water (pH 3) to evaluate the suitability of irradiated UO2-doped thoria as a waste form for direct geological disposal. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction were used to study oxidation of (Th,U)O-2 fuel. The uranium in the surface of (Th,U)O-2 fuel undergoes oxidation similar to that observed in UO2 fuel under similar conditions. Nevertheless. the dissolution rate of uranium from (Th,U)O-2 fuel in aerated solutions is much lower than that from UO2 fuel under similar conditions. These studies suggest that a properly prepared (Th,U)O-2 fuel can be an acceptable waste-form for permanent geological disposal. Crown copyright (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Four pulse irradiation experiments were performed with peak fuel enthalpy ranging from 335 J/g to 586 J/g, resulted in no failure of fuel rods. Relatively large radial deformation of the fuel rods due to pellet-cladding mechanical interaction occurred in the experiments with peak fuel enthalpy above 500 J/g. Significant fission gas release up to 20% was measured by rod puncture measurement. The generation of fine radial cracks in pellet periphery micro-cracks and boundary separation over the entire region of pellet were observed. These microstructure changes might contribute to the swelling of fuel pellets during the pulse irradiation. This could cause the large radial deformation of fuel rod and high fission gas release when the pulse irradiation conducted at relatively high peak fuel enthalpy. In addition, fine grain structures around the plutonium spot and cauliflower structure in cavity of the plutonium spot were observed in the outer region of the fuel pellet.

J	Ahn, J; Greenspan, E; Chambre, PL				Ahn, J; Greenspan, E; Chambre, PL			A preliminary consideration for underground autocatalytic criticality by vitrified high-level waste in water-saturated geologic repository	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						autocatalytic criticality; geologic disposal; vitrified high-level wastes; water-saturated granite; radionuclide transport; minimum critical masses; waste disposal; uranium 235		A preliminary assessment is conducted for the autocatalytic criticality phenomena for the Japanese repository concept, where the vitrified high-level waste (HLW) from reprocessed fuel of commercial light-water reactors is assumed to be disposed of in fractured granitic rock saturated with water. By a static neutronic analysis, the mass of U-235 in 12%-enriched uranium required to make the transition from an under-moderated to an over-moderated critical system in water-saturated granite of a porosity of 0.3 is obtained 35 kg in a spherical core with a radius of 90 cm. The radionuclide transport analysis indicates that in any case the only fissile nuclide of concern for the autocatalytic criticality scenario is 235U. Other fissile nuclides are too short-lived, or are accompanied with a strong neutron absorber. This preliminary study indicates that the transport model can be simplified for uranium isotopes, with which a statistical uncertainty analysis can be performed to finally determine whether or not the autocatalytic criticality event can be screened out from the scenarios for the generic performance assessment of the conceptual repository.

Therefore, new measurements have been performed at the PGAA facility at Budapest Research Reactor (BRR) in order to create a prompt gamma-ray catalog for qualitative and quantitative analysis. Prompt gamma-ray energies and associated k(0)-factors have been determined by internal standardization. The resulting catalog contains prompt gamma-ray data from neutron capture and other reactions such as (n,alpha), and decay gamma-ray data from short-lived reaction products. Data have been measured for nearly all stable elements, from hydrogen to uranium. Generally, data for several isotopes are given, to enable isotopic analysis as well.

However, high levels of radioactivity induced in large metallic samples by irradiation in a neutron field give rise to matrix interferences which are significant at low oxygen concentrations.

Experimental verifications (benchmarks) of the code predictions have been performed at ENEA Frascati by means of an irradiation facility consisting of a D-T neutron generator and a moderator/reflector structure which is employed to mimic the neutron spectrum at the a fusion device first wall. Various materials (vanadium alloy, SIG, AISI 316, martensitic steel F82H. copper, tungsten. iron. niobium), candidates to be used in a fusion reactor, have been exposed to neutrons produced in the facility (about 10(9) n.cm(-2).s(-1)) and the short and medium-lived induced radioactivity has been measured by gamma-ray spectroscopy. The experimental results have been used to validate the inventory code FISPACT, the physical database EAF, including its uncertainty predictions, and the composition of the material irradiated in particular for its minor elements and impurities. The comparison between calculated (C) and experimental results (E) is reported as C/E values and shows a satisfactory agreement for almost all radionuclides. Radionuclides for which there is not agreement between calculations and experiments are also discussed and an analysis of the causes of the lack of agreement is carried out.

High density polyethylene capsules are used for transporting the samples in a pneumatic transfer system, from the reactor, to the neutron detection rig. The detector has a background of 3.6 counts per minute, however the empty transport capsules produce 11.0 counts above the background. We have determined that neither uranium in the polyethylene or from contamination of the capsule nor N-17 from the O-17(n,p)N-17 and O-18(n,d)N-17 reactions are the cause.

J	Omoto, A; Moriya, K; Karasawa, H				Omoto, A; Moriya, K; Karasawa, H			Hydrogen management and overpressure protection of the containment for future boiling water reactors	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						hydrogen management; overpressure protection; boiling water reactors		New design and evaluation method for hydrogen management of containment atmosphere have been developed for application in the future boiling water reactor (BWR). These are intended as a part of consideration of severe accidents in the course of design so as to assure a high level of confidence that a large release of radioactivity to the environment that may result in unacceptable social consequences can reasonably be avoided. Emphasis on hydrogen management and protection against overpressure failure is based on the insights from probabilistic safety assessments (PSAs) that late phase overpressure (and associated leakage) and molten cerium concrete reaction (MCCI) need attention to ensure that containment remains intact, in case energetic challenges to the containment such as DCH (direct containment heating) or FCI (fuel coolant interactions) are practically eliminated by design or resolved from risk standpoint of view. The authors studied the use of palladium-coated tantalum for hydrogen removal from containment atmosphere in order to avoid pressurization of the containment with small free volume by non-condensable gas and steam. Its effectiveness for ABWR (advanced boiling water reactor) containment was evaluated using laboratory test data. Although further experimental studies are necessary to confirm its effectiveness in real accident conditions. the design is a promising option and one that could be backfitted upon necessity to existing plants for which pressure retaining capability cannot be altered. Also new evaluation method for flammability control under severe accident conditions was developed. This method employes a realistic assessment of the amount of oxygen and hydrogen gases generated by radiolytic decomposition of water under severe accident conditions and their subsequent transport from water to containment atmosphere.

J	Chang, HJ; Liu, JJ; Wang, JH				Chang, HJ; Liu, JJ; Wang, JH			Fuel storage facilities for 200-MW nuclear heating reactor	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								This paper reflects the thoughts and work concerning considerations and design of 200-MW nuclear heating reactor (NHR-200) developed in Institute of Nuclear Energy Technology (INET), Tsinghua University, China. Due to the fact that the size of heating reactors is limited to the local demands which are generally smaller that the economic reasonable size as compared to those reactors for electricity production, the design of systems for NHR-200 should be specified in accordance with its design characteristics, and simplified as much as possible for economic aim. The nuclear heating reactor has a low power density in the core and that the annual generation period is only about 180 days. Therefore, the total required number of fuel bundles is rather small. Furthermore, in-vessel spent fuel storage is feasible. All these features raise the potential to simplify the fuel storage system for NHR-200. The fuel storage and inspection facilities are described. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

This technique involves the measurement of isotopic ratios of stable noble fission gases from on-stack emissions during reprocessing of spent fuel using high-precision mass spectrometry. These results are then compared to a database of calculated isotopic ratios using a data analysis method to determine specific fuel parameters (e.g., burnup, fuel type, reactor type, etc.). These inferred parameters call be used to verify operator declarations. The integrated system (mass spectrometry, reactor modeling, and data analysis) has been validated using on-stack measurements during reprocessing of fuel from a US production reactor. These measurements led to an inferred burnup that matched the declared burnup to within 3.9%. suggesting that the current system is sufficient fur most safeguards applications. Partial system validation using gas samples from literature measurements of power reactor fuel has been reported elsewhere, This has shown that the technique developed here may have some difficulty distinguishing pressurized water reactor (PWR) from boiling water reactor (BWR) fuel; however, it consistently can distinguish light water reactor (either PWR or BWR) fuels from other reactor fuel types. Future validations will include advanced power reactor fuels (such as breeder reactor fuels) and research reactor fuels as samples become available. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Fission products and alpha-particles are produced during the transmutation. The impact of alpha-particles is simulated by 30 keV He-3 ion implantations at room temperature (RT) with the doses 6.2, 16, 20 and 53 x 10(15) cm(-2). In another set of experiments a single crystal MgAl2O4 (1 0 0) sample is irradiated with ct-particles (4.5 MeV) from a Am-241 source at RT to a dose of 1.3 x 10(12) cm(-2). Helium release from the implanted samples was studied by thermal desorption spectrometry (TDS), The numerical analysis of the experimental thermal desorption results of alpha-implanted samples to a very low helium concentration (0.0288 appm in the irradiation zone of 12.4 mu m) show that helium release is dominated by helium interstitial diffusion with an activation energy of 1.8 eV. In the case of high dose implantation to 1.74 at.% in the implantation zone approximately of 100 nm, helium is released from He-vacancy clusters with the activation energy of 2.35 eV.

These atoms eventually precipitate in ion-irradiated polymer regions. After Ar+ ion implantation, metallic enrichment by up to a factor 4.5 in concentration could be achieved.

Its main purpose is to produce deuterium-tritium plasma regimes where ignition can take place. From the neutronics point of view, the routine operations with 50% of tritium will lead to a very short (4 s) but intense emission of 14 MeV neutrons (up to 3 x 10(19) n/s). The capability of the boron-free glass reinforced epoxy resin presently adopted for the insulation of the coils conductor to withstand the severe irradiation condition could be a key issue in the performance, reliability and lifespan of Ignitor. In order to better know the radiation environment in which the insulators will operate, calculations of the absorbed dose are performed using the parallelized version of MCNP-4B Monte Carlo code. A detailed 3D geometry description of the tokamak, an accurate representation of the neutron source distribution together with the more recent version of transport cross-section libraries EFF (European Fusion File) are used in this work. The variation of calculated dose depending on the insulator position inside the device, on the neutron energy spectra and on the total number of neutrons produced over the scheduled machine lifetime are discussed in the present paper.

The ions were Zn, Mo, Cd, Sn, Xe, I, Pb, Au and U. The threshold energy loss for formation of visible tracks in UO2 could be determined to be in the range 22-29 keV/nm. Fission products of fission energy are below this threshold but nevertheless form thermal spikes in UO2. Observable tracks are only found at the surface. By using I-127-beams of 72 MeV energy the consequences of fission product impact, i.e., lattice parameter increase, fission gas bubble formation, resolution of fission gas from bubbles and fission-enhanced diffusion were all observed and measured. The swelling of UO2 was confirmed to be small and the technologically important process of polygonization (grain subdivision, also called rim-effect in operating UO2-fuel) could be simulated. The results obtained are important in understanding the operating behavior of UO2, today's fuel in nuclear electricity-producing power stations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The benchmark problems have been specified to investigate the physical phenomena occurring during the progressive voidage of MOX-fueled tight-pitch lattices, such as high conversion light water reactor lattices, and to evaluate the impact of nuclear data and calculational methods. Despite the most recently compiled nuclear data libraries and the sophisticated calculation schemes employed in both code systems, the k(infinity) and void reactivity values obtained by the two code systems show considerable discrepancy especially in the highly voided state. The discrepancy of k(infinity) values shows an obvious dependence on void fraction and also has been shown to be sensitive to the isotopic composition of plutonium. The observed discrepancies are analyzed by being decomposed into contributing isotopes and reactions and have been shown to be caused by a complicated balance of both negative and positive components, which are mainly attributable to differences in a limited number of isotopes including Pu-239, Pu-241 O-16 and stainless steel.

J	Paratte, JM; Pelloni, S				Paratte, JM; Pelloni, S			Influence of the thermal cutoff energy on the calculation of neutronic parameters for light water reactor lattices	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article								Efforts are currently being pursued to validate present-day analysis methods for light water reactors (LWRs) in conjunction with advanced fuels having a high plutonium content. One particular problem, encountered in the framework of cell calculations performed at the Paul Scherrer Institute for infinite arrays of uranium-free plutonium fuel rods considered earlier in the framework of an international benchmark, is that significant k(infinity) decreases can be observed by just raising the upper energy boundary of the thermal range from 1.3 to 2.4 eV(some other LWR lattice codes utilize even smaller values for this cutoff energy). The present study indicates that the sensitivity of the computed k(infinity) with respect to the upper boundary of the thermal range results primarily from the different scattering matrices for hydrogen. The thermal motion of the scattering nucleus is taken into account in the thermal energy range, while a zero velocity of the scattering nucleus is assumed in the elastic scattering matrices employed in the epithermal energy range. Therefore, if the thermal cutoff energy is increased, the energy loss of the neutrons scattered down by hydrogen from energies between the original and the larger cutoff value is reduced resulting in a shift of the neutron spectrum toward higher energies. The sensitivity of the computed k(infinity) with respect to the upper boundary of the thermal range, however, does not depend on upscattering effects, which were estimated to be negligibly small for energies greater than similar to 1 eV. Instead of further raising the upper energy boundary of the thermal range (the choice of an appropriate, sufficiently large value being strongly problem dependent), the analytical recalculation of the epithermal scattering matrices for the moderator nuclides, based on the free gas model (instead of the elastic scattering model, which assumes a zero velocity for the scattering nucleus), is proposed. Several beginning of-life LWR systems have been analyzed with the new method. In particular, for a representative cell with uranium-free plutonium fuel consisting of a mixture of oxides of reactor-grade plutonium, zirconium, and the burnable poison erbium, the use of the new epithermal free gas scattering matrices results in a k(infinity) decrease of similar to 700 pcm (pcm = 1.0 x 10(-5)). For a mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel assembly with 4.8 wt% fissile plutonium in depleted uranium, typical of a present-day pressurized water reactor, the computed k(infinity) decreases by as much as similar to 400 pcm. For fresh assemblies with UO2 fuel, the decrease is less significant (<100 pcm). The effect is thus particularly important for cases with strong resonance absorptions in the lower-electron-volt range. Rearing in mind that present-day LWRs are being loaded with a larger number of assemblies with MOX fuel, a general recommendation is to compute the epithermal scattering matrices of hydrogen by accounting for the thermal motion of the nucleus below a sufficiently high energy limit. Upscattering effects being negligibly small for energies greater than similar to 1 eV; the specific choice of a thermal cutoff energy larger than similar to 1 eV is, of course, not important as far as upscattering is concerned. However, the choice of a sufficiently high thermal cutoff energy could help in reducing the inaccuracies produced by an inadequate model in the epithermal energy range.

The overall strategy is: (a) generation of the problem-dependent cross-section library from basic Evaluated Nuclear Data Files such as ENDF/B-VI and JENDL-3.2 with NJOY94.10+, (b) use of the WIMSD-5 package to generate a few-group neutron macroscopic cross section for all of the materials in the core and its immediate neighborhood, (c) use the three-dimensional CITATION code to perform the global analysis of the core, and (d) checking of the validity of the CITATION diffusion code with the MCNP4B2 Monte Carlo code. The ultimate objective is to establish methods for reshuffling the current core configuration to upgrade the thermal flux at irradiation locations for increased isotope production. The computational methods, tools and techniques, customization of cross-section libraries, various models for cells and supercells, and many associated utilities are standardized and established/validated for the overall neutronic analysis. The excess reactivity, neutron flux, power distribution, power peaking factors, determination of the hot spot, and fuel temperature reactivity coefficients alpha(f) in the temperature range of 45 to 1000 degrees C are studied. All the analyses are performed using the 4- and 7-group libraries of the macroscopic cross sections generated from the 69-group WIMSD-5 library. The 7-group calculations yield comparatively better agreement with the experimental value of k(eff) and the other core parameters. The CITATION test runs using different cross-section sets based on the different models applied in the WIMSD-5 calculations show a strong influence of those models on the final integral parameter. Some of the cells are specially treated with the Prize options available in WIMSD-5 to take into account the fine structure of the flux gradient in the fuel-reflector interface region. The hot spot is found physically at the fuel position C4 with a maximum power density of 1.044559 X 10(2) W/cm(3). The calculated total peaking factor is 5.8867 compared to the original SAR value of 5.6325. The curve of alpha(f) with the temperature at zero burnup shows that the curve deviates somewhat with that reported in the original SAR for low-enriched uranium fuel. The MCNP calculations establish that the CITATION calculations and the generated cross-section library are reasonably good for neutronic analysis of TRIGA reactors. The results obtained from the neutronic analysis will be used to analyze the thermal-hydraulic behavior and the safety margins of the core both for steady-state and pulse-mode operations.

Such a possibility could be provided by an LWR fuel consisting of Pu in a neutronically inert matrix. It may be necessary to add a burnable absorber or thorium to reduce the reactivity swing during burnup. The methods and data currently used for LWR analyses have not been tested in conjunction with such exotic fuel materials. An international exercise has accordingly been launched to compare the relative performance of different code systems and the accuracy of the basic data. Comparison of the results of cell calculations done with fixed isotopic densities against reference Monte Carlo results shows fairly small but systematic differences in the multiplication factors. A sensitivity analysis done with different basic cross section libraries and the same code system allows one to distinguish between the effects of the codes and those of the databases. The results of the burnup calculations indicate a fair agreement in k(infinity) both at beginning of life (BOL) and after 1200 days of irradiation [end of life (EOL)] under conditions representative of a present-day pressurized water reactor. At BOL, the fuel temperature coefficients agree fairly well among the different contributions, but unacceptably large differences are observed at EOL. The void coefficients agree well for low voidage, but for void fractions >90%, there are significant effects mostly due to the databases used. The agreement in the calculated boron worths is good.

In recent years, these systems have been studied to develop a cradle-to-grave process for the decontamination of ferrous metals typical of the nuclear power industry, This paper expands the understanding of this system to the dissolution of ferrous oxides found on corroded metals of nuclear facilities. It is found that pure iron oxides such as magnetite (Fe3O4) and hematite (Fe2O3) dissolved quickly (<1 h) using 0.5 M 1-hydroxyethane-1,1-diphosphonic acid (HEDPA) and a strong reducing agent; the oxides with slower kinetics are the spinel structures, such as the nickel ferrites (NiOFe2O3), which dissolved very slowly in the foregoing solution, These results were confirmed in bench-scale tests on actual carbon steel and radioactively contaminated stainless steel samples. The decontamination of actual stainless steel from a nuclear reactor vessel required high concentrations of both HEDPA and reducing agent. Methods for treating the spent HEDPA solution are discussed.

The largess deposition yield was obtained for Pd, supported by its large rate constants. Rate constants of RuNO3+ and ReO4- were, however, smaller than that of Pd2+; their yield can be improved under high cathode current supply in lower nitric acid concentration. Rather high apparent activation energy was observed for the deposition of RuNO3+. Peculiar masking or synergistic effects in their electrodeposition behaviours might be due to mutual interaction of RuNO3+, Pd2+ with ReO4- in nitric acid solution. Sufficiently different redissolution potentials for deposited metals indicate their fractional recovery by anode processing. Mediatory electrochemical oxidation (MEO) was investigated for the mineralization of waste O phi D[iB]CMPO (hereafter CMPO) by burning its bulky hydrocarbon moiety under the existence of various kinds of metal ions. Only Ag2+/+ offered high-current efficiency up to 75%, fairly exceeding that by direct electrooxidation. Redox coupling characterized by a simple electron transfer, Mm+ + ne(-) double left right arrow M(m-n)+ provided high E-0, will act exactly as an active mediator. As for the destruction paths for CMPO by MEO, cleavage between carbonyl C and N of amide moiety was of principal importance. The coupling of Co3+/2+ is also recommended because of hydraulic advantages.

A new method was developed for the accurate measurement of K shell fluorescence yields. This method involves measurement of K shell fluorescence yields in terms of the photon scattering cross section in carbon. For this reason, carbon was used as a scattering target. The targets were excited using 59.5 keV gamma rays from an Am-241 radioactive source of strength 100 mCi. The results of the present work are compared with earlier experimental results obtained by other methods, theoretical predictions and semiemprical fits reported in the literature.

The microcalorimeter consists of a copper foil with an implanted tritium source. The foil is soldered to a thin film gold pad on a silicon wafer that is in thermal contact with an aluminum/silver bilayer transition-edge sensor. The device is voltage biased with current pulses read out using a SQUID magnetometer. The device has been tested with external sources as well as an implanted tritium source. The device is currently too slow to set a meaningful limit on the square of the neutrino mass, but can be made fast enough to set a limit on the order of 10 eV. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

This implies decay scheme studies which require high-energy resolution spectrometry and also activity measurements using low threshold and high detection efficiency detectors. To explore the capabilities of cryogenic detectors for low-energy X-ray metrology, there has been a collaboration with the Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale in order to develop a fast microcalorimeter with a till absorber which guarantees a detection efficiency greater than 99.9% in the 1-6 keV energy range.

Typical cross-section results, both double-differential and total, are calculated to confirm the effects of nuclear spin correlations, i.e. ortho and para, and molecular translations and rotations. A slowing-down property is also analyzed in terms of the average cosine of scattering angle and the average energy of scattered neutrons. It is shown that the present models are able to serve for the generation of basic cross-section file in developing and advanced neutron source. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Williams, MMR				Williams, MMR			The effect of random geometry on the criticality of a multiplying system II: Extension to resonance absorption	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								In an earlier paper, a method was developed for calculating the probability distribution of the multiplication factor in a reactor in which the fuel elements are randomly distributed across the core. In this paper, the method is extended to include resonance absorption and also to the case where the fuel elements have random values of enrichment. As before, the Feinberg-Galanin-Horning source-sink method is used. The probability distribution P(k(eff)) is calculated for a bare reactor containing from 1 to 10 fuel plates. We observe that k(eff) lies in the range (k(eff), (min), k(eff), (max)) and we also note that as the number of fuel plates increases, the form of P(k(eff)) becomes Gaussian-like, but can never be exactly Gaussian because of the finite limits on k(eff). We have also discovered that the general rule put forward by previous workers in this field, namely that (k(eff)) for the spaiially random medium is always greater than the corresponding deterministic value, no longer holds in general. Further calculations with U-235 and Al plates suggests that the presence of resonance absorption may be the cause of this discrepancy. There is also the fact that in this work a realistic slowing down model is used whereas previous workers used one-speed theory. Some new results for basic source-sink theory are also reported.

J	Ashoub, N; Saleh, HG				Ashoub, N; Saleh, HG			Neutronic evaluation of two proposed fuel lattice pitches for ET-RR-1 reactor	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								The present fuel element of the ET-RR1 research reactor has a 1.75 cm lattice pitch. The neutronic studies were proved that, this lattice pitch is over moderated and not the suitable one from the fuel economic point of view. Two fuel lattice pitches are proposed, one has 1.4 cm lattice pitch with 10% U-235 enrichment and the other has 1.75 cm lattice pitch with 15% U-235 enrichment. The comparative neutronic study was done between these two proposed fuel lattice pitches against the present one in two cases, one for the complete core configuration of the ET-RR-1 which includes 52 fuel elements and the other for one of the actual core configuration load contains 47 fuel elements. This study is included the calculations of different neutronic parameters as the infinite and effective multiplication factor, the multigroup neutron flux along the reactor core, and the power peaking factor. The above factors were calculated by using the WIMSD4 code for lattice cell calculation, and the DIXY2 code for diffusion calculations. The results are represented in some tables and figures.

The multitracer solution was prepared by irradiation of UO2(NO3)(2) with Ar-40 ion beam. It was found that there is a common general trend of variation in Kd for both soils and the alumina, i.e. all the shapes of plots of log K-d versus electron binding energy (I-z) are an 'inverted V', hence the important role of chemical interaction in the adsorption of trace inorganic cations, anions and neutral complexes on the soils and the oxides was demonstrated. For the alkali and alkaline earth elements, the common sequences of K-d values on the three adsorbents were Na+ < K+ < Rb+ < Cs+ (except for Rb+ on the alumina) and Mg2+ < Sr2+ < Ba2+ and accord with the sequences of effective ionic radii or single ion hydration enthalpies.

We prepared Re-188-tin colloid and compared its properties with Re-188-sulfur colloid. Labeling efficiencies reached >98% for tin colloid at 2 h and 89-94% for sulfur colloid at 3 h. All the preparations were stable for 72 h in water, serum, and synovial fluid. If labeled at higher temperature, the particle size of tin colloid increased. The residual radioactivity of Re-188-sulfur colloid in disposable polypropylene syringes after injecting mice was high (62.0 +/- 7.0%) due to its hydrophobic nature, while that of Re-188-tin colloid was low (2.9 +/- 1.6%). Although both Re-188-tin colloid and Re-188-sulfur colloid might be useful for radionuclide therapy, we conclude that Re-188-tin colloid is more advantageous over Re-188-sulfur colloid, due to higher labeling efficiency, control of the particle size, and lower residual activity in the injection syringes.

Procaterol was labelled by reductive alkylation of the desisopropyl precursor with [C-11]acetone under the influence of NaCNBH3 and acetic acid. Synthesis and HPLC purification were performed in 34 min. Specific activities ranged from 26.5-39.3 TBq (about 700-1000 Ci)/mmol and the radiochemical yield was 2.4-8.6% (corrected for decay). Biodistribution studies were performed in male Wistar rats which were either untreated or predosed with (D,L)-propranolol hydrochloride (beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, 2.5 mg/kg), ICI 118551 (beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, 0.15 mg/ kg), CGP 20712A (beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, 0.15; mg/kg) or isoprenaline (B-adrenoceptor agonist, 15 mg/kg). Specific binding was observed in lungs, spleen and red blood cells, tissues known to contain beta(2)-adrenoceptors. Pulmonary binding was blocked by propranolol, ICI 118551 and isoprenaline, but not by CGP 20712A. This binding pattern is consistent with the beta(2) selectivity of the adioligand. The clearance of [C-11]procaterol was biphasic, with a rapid distribution phase (t(1/2) 0.17 min) representing 90% of the injected dose followed by an elimination phase (t(1/2) 18.1 min). About 45% of the plasma radioactivity was unmetabolized procaterol at 15 min postinjection. In a dynamic PET-study, the lungs of untreated control rats could barely be detected and total/non-specific binding ratios rose to only 1.2 at 20 min postinjection. Although labelling and administration of (-) erythro-procaterol the most active of 4 stereoisomers, may produce better results, [C-11]procaterol seems unsuitable for beta-adrenoceptor imaging.
