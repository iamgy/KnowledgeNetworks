Tritium and helium release from highly neutron irradiated titanium beryllide	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	28th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 29-OCT 03, 2014	San Sebastian, SPAIN	Spanish Res Ctr Energy Environm & Technol		Beryllium; Titanium beryllide; Neutron irradiation; Tritium and helium release	HIGH-TEMPERATURE; PEBBLES	Beryllium, Be5Ti, and Be7Ti as pellet specimens have been irradiated at the HFR, Petten, the Netherlands at temperatures of 684-959 K up to 301 appm tritium and 3060 appm helium productions. For beryllium, under thermal desorption tests only one major peak was revealed either for tritium and helium release. Both peaks are located at the same temperatures of 1250-1350K. The Be-Ti microstructure contains two phases, mainly titanium beryllide Be12Ti and also small addition of beryllium. First helium release peak as well as the tritium release peak is detected at 1000-1100 K. Second helium release peak is revealed at temperatures of 1350-1370K. A conclusion was made that the facilitated tritium escaping from Be-Ti specimens is caused by accelerated diffusion of tritium through the channels formed in the beryllium phase under irradiation. This suggests a positive role of small additions of beryllium phase in Be-Ti intermetallic compounds that minimizes the finale tritium inventory. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An experimental evaluation is one of the tools used to realize the process design of the SDS. The capacity of the buffer vessels is strongly related with determining the amount of equipment and the operating conditions. The minimum operating pressure of the buffer vessels is evaluated with respect to the various conditions of the buffer vessel switching criterion and the number of metal bellows pumps parallel-combined for each ITER plasma operation. Under the selected conditions, a case study was performed to propose Isotope Separation System (ISS) interface information with respect to the number of the buffer vessels. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this case, considering that huge amount of beryllium are needed in fusion power plants, its handling difficulty and cost can be a major factor to be accounted for commercial use. Korea has proposed a Helium-Cooled Ceramic Reflector (HCCR) breeding blanket concept relevant to fusion power plants. Here, graphite is used as a reflector material by reducing the amount of beryllium multiplier. Its feasibility has been investigated in view point of the nuclear performance as well as material-related issues. In this paper, a nuclear analysis is performed under the fusion reactor condition to address the feasibility of graphite reflector in breeding blanket, considering tritium breeding capability and neutron shielding and activation aspects. Also, the chemical stability of the graphite is investigated considering the chemical stability under accident conditions, resulting in that the adaptation of graphite reflector in breeding blanket is intrinsically safe and plausible under fusion reactor condition.

The Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK) proposed a new fully continuous approach for tritium extraction from the solid breeding blanket of fusion machines that improves the overall tritium management and minimizes both the tritium inventory and processing time. It is based on membrane permeation as a pre-concentration stage upstream of a final tritium recovery stage using a catalytic Pd-based membrane reactor. Zeolite membranes were identified as the most promising candidates for the pre-concentration stage. In the present work the tubular zeolite MFI membrane provided by the Institute for Ceramic Technologies and Systems (IKTS, Hermsdorf, Germany) is studied to consolidate the proposed approach. The permeation measurements for single gases hydrogen (replacing radioactive tritium) and helium, for binary mixtures H-2/He and H2O/He at different concentrations and temperatures are presented. The tested membrane demonstrates a high performance, almost independent from the inlet composition in the case of a gaseous mixture, while the transport in the presence of water vapour is strongly related to the temperature of the mixture and component concentrations.

The systems operational characteristics have been surveyed in a test bed. The gun is designed to launch cylindrical pellets with 2 mm diameter and 2 mm length, produced from frozen deuterium D-2, hydrogen H-2 or a gas mixture consisting of 50% H-2 and 50% D-2. Pellets are accelerated by a short pulse of pressurized helium propellant gas to velocities in the range of 100-250 m/s. Delivery reliabilities at the launcher exit reach almost unity. The initial pellet mass is reduced to about 50% during the acceleration process. Pellet transfer to the plasma vessel was investigated by a first mock up guiding tube version. Transfer through this S-shaped stainless steel guiding tube (inner diameter 8 mm; length 6 m) containing two I m curvature radii was investigated for all pellet types. Tests were performed applying repetition rates from 2 Hz to 50 Hz and propellant gas pressures ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 MPa. For both H-2 and D-2, low overall delivery efficiencies were observed at slow repetition rates, but stable efficiencies of about 90% above 10 Hz. About 10% of the mass is eroded while flying through the guiding tube. Pellets exit the guiding tube with an angular spread of less than 14 degrees. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Lithium orthosilicate based pebbles with different metatitanate contents and pellets of the individual oxide components were exposed to a deuterium atmosphere at room temperature. Then the thermally induced release of deuterium gas was registered up to 800 degrees C. This as-received behavior was studied in comparison with that after exposing the deuterium-treated samples to 4 MGy total dose of gamma radiation. The thermal desorption spectra reveal differences in deuterium sorption/desorption behavior depending on the composition and the induced ionizing damage. In these breeder candidates, strong desorption rate at approx. 300 degrees C takes place, which slightly increases with increasing amount of the titanate second phase. For all studied materials, ionizing radiation induces electronic changes disabling a number of trapping centers for D-2 adsorption. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These are the responsible for the tritium breeding and part of the heat extraction in the HCPB TBM. After a detailed design and engineering phase performed during the last years in the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), a reference model for the manufacturing of a HCPB BU mock-up has been obtained. The mid-term is the out-of-pile qualification of the thermal and thermo-mechanical performance of a full-scale HCPB BU mock-up in a dedicated helium loop. Several key manufacturing technologies have been developed for the fabrication of the HCPB BU. In order to pre-qualify these techniques, a Short Breeder Unit mock-up (SHOBU) is under construction and to be tested. This paper aims at describing the relevance of SHOBU with a full-scale HCPB BU, the constitutive parts of SHOBU, the manufacturing and joining technologies involved, the assembly sequence (taking into consideration functional steps like its filling with Li4SiO4 pebbles or its assembly in the HCPB TBM) and the welding procedures studied. The paper concludes with a description of the required pre-qualification tests performed to SHOBU, i.e. pressure and leak tightness tests, according to the standards. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Li2TiO3 with excess Li (Li2+x TiO3+y) has been developed as a material for an advanced tritium breeder. Considering the tritium release characteristics and the packing factor of the blanket, the optimum pebble diameter and grain size after sintering were determined to be 1 mm and <5 mu m, respectively. Therefore, optimum sintering conditions were surveyed in-the present study to obtain these target values. The predominant factor affecting grain growth is assumed to be the presence of binder in the gel particles. This remaining binder reacts with the excess Li in the Li2+x TiO3+y and Li2CO3 is generated, which promotes grain growth. To inhibit the generation of Li2CO3, calcined Li2+xTiO3+y pebbles were sintered under vacuum and subsequent 1% H-2-He atmosphere conditions. The diameter of the sintered Li2+xTiO3+y pebbles was 1.07 mm, and the average grain size on the surfaces and cross sections was <5 mu m. The results presented show that Li2+xTiO3+y, pebbles with optimum characteristics were successfully fabricated using the emulsion method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The upgrade in catalytic activity of hydrophobic platinum catalysts is required since the catalysts generally decrease in catalytic activity with a decrease in temperature. To upgrade in catalytic activity of granular polymer supported hydrophobic platinum catalysts, application of irradiation with electron beams has demonstrated. After irradiation with electron beams, the catalytic activity was evaluated by means of assessing overall reaction rate constant for the oxidation of tritium. The overall reaction rate constant increased as increase in dose. The constant showed the peak value in the dose between 500 and 750 kGy. After the peak, the constant decreased as increase in dose. The overall reaction rate constant at the peak was 6 times larger than that evaluated with unirradiated. The mechanical strength of irradiated catalysts kept integrity until 1500 kGy. The irradiation is a promising method to the upgrading in catalytic activity of Pt/SDBC group catalysts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The SD-TFC model is illustrated as a pipe diagram which consists of tritium stocks, such as plasma, fuel clean up, isotope separation, fueling with storage and blanket, and pipes connecting among them. By using this model, we survey a possibility of D-D start-up without initial loading of tritium on two kinds of fusion plant having different plasma parameters. The D-D start-up scenario can reduce the necessity of initial loading of tritium through the production in plasma by D-D reaction and in breeding blanket by D-D neutron. The model is also used for considering operation scenario to avoid excess stock of tritium which must be produced at tritium breeding ratio over unity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Li mass loss for the Li2TiO3 at 900 degrees C was 0.4 wt% under 1000 Pa H-2 atmosphere and 1.5 wt% under 50 Pa H2O atmosphere. The Li mass loss for the Li2TiO3 increased proportionally to the water vapor pressure in the range from 50 to 200 Pa at 900 degrees C and increased with increasing temperature from 700 to 900 degrees C although Li mass loss at 600 degrees C was significantly smaller than expected. It was found that water vapor concentration dependence and temperature dependence of Li mass loss for the Li2TiO3 and the Li4SiO4 used in this work were quite different. Water vapor is released from the ceramic breeder materials into the purge gas due to desorption of adsorbed water and water formation reaction. The released water vapor possibly promotes Li mass loss with the formation of LiOH on the surface. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The He Cooled Ceramic Reflector (HCCR) TBM consists of functional components such as First Wall (FW), Breeding Zone (BZ), Side Wall (SW), and Back Manifold (BM) and it was designed based on the separate analyses for each component in 2012. Based on the each component analysis model, the integrated model is prepared and thermal-hydraulic analysis for the HCCR TBM is performed in the present study. The coolant flow distribution from BM and SW to FW and BZ, and resulted structure temperatures are obtained with the integrated model. It is found that the non-uniform flow rate occurs at FW and BZ and it causes excess of the design limit (550 degrees C) at some region. Based on this integrated model, we will perform the design optimization for obtaining uniform flow distribution for satisfying the design requirements. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The heat deposited on the blanket is cooled by the helium distributing from the manifolds and flowing in the internal channels of cooling components. To make the temperature of the various blanket components within allowable limits, accurate flow control of helium for the coolant channels should be guaranteed. In this paper, the mass flow rates of helium feeding into the coolant channels were obtained by numerical simulation. The results showed that the helium can be distributed relatively uniform into the first wall channels. However, the mass flow rates of some channel inlets of the other components greatly deviated from the theoretical values.

For the investigation of tritium release from a Li2TiO3 pebble breeder blanket at such a high temperature, we have carried out a tritium release experiment with the DT neutron source at the JAEA-FNS. The Li2TiO3 pebble (1.0-1.2 mm in diameter) of 70g was put into a stainless steel container and installed into an assembly stratified with beryllium and Li2TiO3 layers. During the DT neutron irradiation, the temperature was kept at 1073 K with wire heaters in the blanket container. Helium gas including 1% hydrogen gas (H-2/He) mainly flowed inside the container as the purge gas. Two chemical forms, HT and HTO, of extracted tritium were separately collected during the DT neutron irradiation by using water bubblers and CuO bed. The tritium activity in the water bubbler was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. To investigate the effect of moisture in the purge gas, we also performed the same experiments with H2O/He gas (H2O content: 1%) or pure helium gas. From our experiment at 1073K, in the case of the purge gas includes H-2, it is indicated that the increasing tendency of HT release is similar to that of the dry H-2/He. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The Li vaporization rate from the specimen pellet was measured by gravimetric method, and the change of Li concentration distribution in the pellet was analyzed by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer. Li was vaporized only from the Li2SiO3 at the vicinity of the surface of the pellet. The remarkable vaporization of Li arose only in an early short time. The inhibition of the vaporization from the Li2SiO3 was successful by adding the small amount of the stable secondary phase of Li2TiO3. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Pebbles of a ceramic tritium breeder are packed in a container of the blanket. Investigation of the flow behavior is necessary in an actual environment of a facility where pressure drop takes place under a complex flow such as in case of the container for the pebble bed. For the development of a facility, it is necessary to be able to monitor fluid motion of a basic flow such as a sphere-packed pipe (SPP). In the present study, to discern the complex flow structures in SPP, digital holographic PTV visualization is carried out by a refractive index-matching method using a water employed as a working fluid. The water is chosen to be able to adjust its refractive index to match to that of the MEXFLON pebble with an index of 1.33. Hologram fringe images of particles behind the spheres can be observed, and the particles' positions can be reconstructed by a digital hologram. Consequently, 3-D velocity-fields around the spheres are obtained by the reconstructed particles' positions. The velocity between pebbles is found to be convergence and divergence regions in the SPP.

Spatially and temporally varying tritium generation in solid-type breeder blankets	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	28th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 29-OCT 03, 2014	San Sebastian, SPAIN	Spanish Res Ctr Energy Environm & Technol		Fusion; Tritium; Inventory; Neutronics; Burn-up; Blanket	BURN-UP; MODEL	High energy neutrons produced in future fusion reactors will cause significant transmutation reactions in the breeder blanket, including the important tritium breeding reactions. The reaction rate for a given reaction type depends on the neutron spectrum and material properties. The inventory consequences for tritium production of a solid-type breeder blanket are discussed in this paper. A DEMO fusion reactor with 19 homogeneous breeder blanket modules made of Eurofer, helium, Be12Ti and Li4SiO4, with enriched Li-6 content. Each blanket module was segmented radially in order to analyse the time-dependent reaction rate as a function of depth. The resolution of radial segmentation was varied and 5 radial divisions were found to be sufficient to accurately model the tritium inventory. Time-dependent tritium production was simulated with the use of the interface code, FATI, which couples radiation transport code MCNP 6 with the inventory code FISPACT-II. The simulated results show how the tritium production varies over the expected lifetime of the blanket. The overall tritium production of the solid-type blanket decreases as the Li-6 and Li-7 are burnt up. The effect of Li burn-up in the breeder zones nearest to the plasma is identified as the main contributing factor to the decreasing tritium production of the whole breeder blanket.

Considering the continuity with the ITER test blanket module option of Japan and the engineering feasibility in its fabrication, our design study focused on a water-cooled solid breeding blanket using the mixed pebbles bed. Herein, we propose blanket segmentation corresponding to the shape and dimension of the blanket and routing of the coolant flow. Moreover, we estimate the overall tritium breeding ratio (TBR) with a torus configuration, based on the segmentation using three-dimensional (3D) Monte Carlo N-particle calculations. As a result, the overall TBR is 1.15. Our 3D neutronics analysis for TBR ensures that the blanket concept can achieve a self-sufficient supply of tritium. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

During its production, recovering and purification, tritium comes in contact with large surfaces of hot metallic walls, therefore it can permeate through the blanket cooling structure, reach the steam generator and finally the environment. The development of dedicated simulation tools able to predict tritium losses and inventories is necessary to verify the accomplishment of the accepted tritium environmental releases as well as to guarantee a correct machine operation. In this work, the FUS-TPC code is improved by including the possibility to operate in pulsed regime: results in terms of tritium inventory and losses for three pulsed scenarios are shown. Moreover, the development of a 1-D model considering the radial profile of the tritium generation is described. By referring to the inboard segment on the equatorial axis of the helium-cooled lithium-lead (HCLL) blanket, preliminary results of the 1-D model are illustrated: tritium partial pressure in Li-Pb and tritium permeation in the cooling and stiffening plates by assuming several permeation reduction factor (PRF) values. Future improvements will consider the application of the model to all segments of different blanket concepts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, tritium can contaminate the reactor structures, and can be eventually released into the environment. Tritium in reactor components should therefore be kept under close control throughout the fusion reactor lifetime, bearing in mind the risk of accidents, the need for maintenance and the detritiation of dismantled reactor components before their re-use or disposal. A modeling work has been performed to address these issues in view of its utilization for the TES (Tritium Extraction System), in the case of the HCPB TBM and for a molecular sieve as adsorbent material. A computational model has been setup and tested. The results of experimental measurement of fundamental parameters such as mass transfer coefficients have been implemented in the model. It turns out the capability of the model to describe the extraction process of gaseous tritium compounds and to estimate the breakthrough curves of the two main tritium gaseous species (H2 and HT).

The pellet injector consists of two independent modules operating at 1-25 Hz. Both modules are equipped with screw extruders cooled by liquid helium for solid deuterium ice production at steady state mode. An innovative pellet fabrication and acceleration system has been designed and applied to reduce gas load on the extruders in 4-5 times and to increase the pellet injection reliability. Pellets of 1.5 mm diameter and 1.5 mm length were injected at 250 +/- 50 m/s velocity at 25 Hz with reliability over 93% using one module in preliminary tests. Two modules working in turn are under tests now. It is anticipated they will be able to inject pellets at 50Hz after further technical improvements in near future. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A hydrogen-soluble metal powder mixed with a molten salt can increase the effective hydrogen solubility of the molten salt, which is currently a major disadvantage of molten salts. A significant increase in hydrogen solubility was observed, even with a mass fraction of Ti powder of only 0.1 wt%. The increase of hydrogen solubility was so large that a vanadium alloy would be compatible with the Ti powder/molten salt mixture, unlike typical molten salts that result in an unacceptably large tritium inventory in the vanadium alloy. In addition, contamination of the Ti powder by oxidation suppressed the hydrogen uptake and release capability. Controlling the purity of the molten salt was found to be one of the key issues for the metal powder mixture concept. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Li4SiO4 and Li2TiO3 are the candidate breeder materials for the HCPB blanket concept. In the HCPB blanket, breeding pebbles with the diameter range of 0.6-1.2 mm are placed between two plates and the bed shall be cooled. Accordingly, effective thermal conductivity of pebble beds needs to be determined for the heat transfer calculation. Measurements of the heat transfer parameters of Li4SiO4 and Li2TiO3 pebble beds are being performed at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). Two measurement methods are being used. One is the steady state method with the use of thermocouples to measure the temperature distribution of the pebble bed. Another is transient thermal probe method using the temperature variation of the thermal probe and Monte Carlo inversion method to calculate the heat transfer parameters of the pebble bed. This paper will report on the progress of these measurement platforms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is essential to breed tritium to maintain the continuous consumption in the D-T plasma so as to sustain the required fusion power. A minimum criterion of calculated tritium breeding ratio (TBR) >1.1 is adopted to ensure tritium self-sufficiency, allowing a 10% safety margin to cover calculation uncertainties. In a DEMO reactor, there are various factors impacting the availability and effectiveness of fusion generated neutrons for production of tritium. In this paper, the study focused on the impact of first wall design including materials and first wall thickness, and blanket coverage aspects such as divertor geometry and the provision of equatorial heating and diagnostic ports.

Experimental determination of solubility values for hydrogen isotopes in eutectic Pb-Li	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	28th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 29-OCT 03, 2014	San Sebastian, SPAIN	Spanish Res Ctr Energy Environm & Technol		Tritium extraction; Breeding blanket; Experimental values; Sieverts' constant; Diffusivity	LITHIUM-LEAD ALLOYS; LI17PB83; TRITIUM; BLANKET; ITER	Hydrogen isotopes solubility in eutectic lithium-lead alloys is really important for the design of breeding blanket components that use this breeding material. The determination of the magnitude and kinetics of the tritium flux from the blanket to the helium cooling loop, along with the design of future tritium extraction systems of the breeding alloy or the He coolant purification system, will be defined on basic transport parameters such as solubility. The unacceptable scattering of Sieverts' constant values in the historical measurements given by different experimental techniques, suggests that this is a very important and unresolved issue. In this work, it has been experimentally evaluated, using absorption and desorption techniques. The different measurement campaigns have been carried out in the temperature range from 523 to 922 K and in the pressure range from 1 to 103 Pa. This paper describes the work carried out in the preparation of the facility, the theoretical model developed to process the different results obtained by means of absorption and desorption runs. Final results obtained during several campaigns of measurements are provided. The obtained values of hydrogen solubility through the different campaigns show a similar value for the Sieverts' constant, and therefore, a very little value for the activation energy in the solution process. Results are compared and discussed. The proposed correlation for hydrogen Sieverts' constant in Pb-Li from these tests is K-s [mol m(-3) Pa-1/2] = 8.64 x 10(-3) exp(-0.9/RT), R in (kJ K-1 mol(-1)).

Displacement damage effect on the radiation induced deuterium absorption for different types of SiC	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	28th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 29-OCT 03, 2014	San Sebastian, SPAIN	Spanish Res Ctr Energy Environm & Technol		Deuterium; Radiation; Absorption; Blanket; SiC; Displacement	FUSION	SiC-derived materials are primary candidates for FCI due to their excellent properties. During reactor operation the ceramic material will be exposed to tritium and also to a hostile radiation environment The two main aims of this work are first to compare different types of SIC in terms of radiation induced deuterium absorption and second to address the displacement damage effects. Thermo stimulated desorption (TSD) measurements were carried out for both electron irradiated and unirradiated samples in order to evaluate radiation enhanced deuterium retention. The amount of deuterium absorbed during irradiation strongly depends on the type of SIC material. To address the displacement damage effects the different types of SIC materials were subjected also to 45 keV neon implantation in order to produce displacement damage. After being implanted the deuterium absorbed became very similar irrespectively to the type of SiC. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Morono, A.; Hodgson, E.

Influence of the P content on the transport parameters of hydrogen in Fe alloys	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	28th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 29-OCT 03, 2014	San Sebastian, SPAIN	Spanish Res Ctr Energy Environm & Technol		Fusion reactor materials; Tritium; Hydrogen; Diffusion; Permeability; Solubility; Diffusivity; Iron alloy; Trapping	ACTIVATION MARTENSITIC STEELS; GRAIN-BOUNDARY; FUSION-REACTOR; THERMAL-STABILITY; FERRITIC STEEL; OPTIFER-IVB; PHOSPHORUS; SEGREGATION; IRON; CR	In this work, the hydrogen transport parameters of permeability (dagger), diffusivity (D) and Sieverts' constant (K-s) were experimentally measured in four Fe alloys supplied by the European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA), by means of the gas evolution permeation technique. The samples had controlled chemical alloying element contents and microstructure. The experimental temperature range explored was from 423 K to 823 K and the high purity hydrogen loading pressures from 10(3) Pa to 1.5.10(5) Pa. The main objective of this work was to determine the influence of the P content of the alloy in the transport parameters of hydrogen. Two of the samples, pure Fe and FeC, contained negligible quantities of P (less than 5 ppm in weight), whereas the other two, FeP and FeCP, had the same metallurgical composition as their corresponding pair, with the only difference in the phosphorus content (89 ppm in weight and 88 ppm in weight, respectively). The experimental permeation results were analyzed using a non-linear least square fitting. The final resulting values of the aforementioned transport parameters were paired off in order to determine the effect of the P content: pure Fe versus FeP and FeC versus FeCP. We observed that the permeability obtained for all the samples follows an Arrhenius law in each case. In general terms, the increase of the P content in the alloy leads to smaller values of the permeability showing a decrease in the permeation activation energy. Regarding diffusivity and Sieverts' constant, trapping effects have been observed for the alloys containing P. This phenomenon was detected at temperatures below 473 K. According to the results, the influence of the metallurgical composition of P in Fe alloys in the transport parameters of hydrogen is studied together with the synergistic effects caused by the presence of C.

In all designs the liquid breeder Pb-15.7Li is in direct contact with the structural material, and thus two major topics - corrosion and T-permeation - influence the reliable, safe and economical application of such combination of breeder and structural material. As bare RAFM steels exhibit high corrosion rates of up to 400 mu m/h in flowing Pb-15.7Li, Al-based coatings made by different coating processes were developed during the last 15 years and showed promising results in protecting RAFM steels from corrosion and T-permeation reduction. Especially barriers made by HDA, and electroplating (ECA, ECX), proved their ability to protect Eurofer against corrosion in flowing Pb-15.7Li. However, available T-permeation data for coated RAFM steels are rare and partly ambiguous for these coatings. This paper summarizes the state-of-the-art of aluminum-based barrier development and points out gaps and needs in future scale characterization and T-permeation barrier development. Additionally, necessary qualification steps on the path toward a reliable fabrication route are presented that is required to produce aluminum-based corrosion and T-permeation barriers on RAFM steels for blanket applications in future fusion reactors like DEMO.

The facility was operated with tritium for its research and development program from 1984 to 2001, running a prototype fusion fuel processing loop with similar to 100 g of tritium as well as small experiments. There have been several operating experience reports written on this facility's operation and maintenance experience. This paper describes reliability analysis of two additional components from TSTA, small diameter copper gas piping that handled tritium in a nitrogen carrier gas, and the flame arrestor used in this piping system. The component failure rates for these components are discussed in this paper. Comparison data from other applications are also presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Since failure of the radwaste pipeline can result in release of radioactive materials and threat the safety of penetrating Tokamak and annex buildings, the pipeline should satisfy requirements of faulted condition as well as normal operating condition. The objective of this study is to examine load-carrying capacity of the ITER radwaste pipeline through systematic numerical analyses. In this context, at first, simplified finite element analyses were performed for five candidate geometries under conservative seismic displacements. Subsequently, modal and response spectrum analyses were conducted for the same geometries to confirm whether the simplified approach is valid or not during the concept design stage. Based on these two kinds of analyses, a spiral-type configuration was derived as the optimum geometry for detailed design of the radwaste pipeline.

Neutronics requirements for a DEMO fusion power plant	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	28th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 29-OCT 03, 2014	San Sebastian, SPAIN	Spanish Res Ctr Energy Environm & Technol		Neutronics; DEMO; Tritium breeding; Shielding	DESIGN	This paper addresses the neutronic requirements a DEMO fusion power plant needs to fulfil for a reliable and safe operation. The major requirement is to ensure Tritium self-sufficiency taking into account the various uncertainties and plant-internal losses that occur during DEMO operation. A further major requirement is to ensure sufficient protection of the superconducting magnets against the radiation penetrating in-vessel components and vessel. Reliable criteria for the radiation loads need to be defined and verified to ensure the reliable operation of the magnets over the lifetime of DEMO. Other issues include radiation induced effects on structural materials such as the accumulated displacement damage, the generation of gases such as helium which may deteriorate the material performance. The paper discusses these issues and their impact on design options for DEMO taking into account results obtained in the frame of European Power Plant Physics and Technology (PPPT) 2013 programme activities with DEMO models employing the helium cooled pebble bed (HCPB), the helium cooled lithium lead (HCLL), and the water-cooled (WCLL) blanket concepts.

It is shown by the neutron activation analysis that a relatively short-lived Ar-41 (T-1/2=1.85 h), Ar-37 (T-1/2=35 days) and rather long lived Ar-39 (T-1/2=269 yr) may appear in these materials under the fusion neutron irradiation conditions. While argon production is essentially less than helium production in irradiated materials, at other times its impact, e.g., in the inhalation dose, becomes significant. In some cases the Ar-39 activity is comparable or even exceeds the C-14 activity and may become apparent after tritium removal from plasma exhaust and dust, from the liquid breeders, during plasma-facing and structural component recycling and waste management. The main source terms of argon-39 activity for these materials are identified and the specific production rates are evaluated relative to radiation conditions of a power or DEMO fusion reactor and to electric power production.

A layout optimization is one of the design concerns for maintaining safety and reliability of the piping, because some piping penetrating the buildings is subjected to large seismic displacements. The objective of this study is to determine an optimum layout for the radioactive liquid transfer piping to withstand a given seismic displacements combined with internal pressure and thermal expansion. To do this, a series of finite element analyses were performed for various layouts. In addition, the feasibility for utilizing the double-walled structure was investigated. Analysis result shows that effects of the internal pressure and thermal expansion on the total stress are very small compared to that of the seismic displacements. Also, the stress as well as the deformation of the double-walled piping is larger than that of the single-walled piping although the difference is not big. Based on this result, an optimum configuration, a spiral along with U shape, is suggested. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The design of the PPTF and the HCB walls adjacent to the PPTF aims to have the docking room, which is next to the test tank room containing the PPTF, having as low as reasonable dose rate of 25 mu Sv/h. In this work, the R2Smesh approach, developed by KIT for the determination of shut-down dose rate distributions in and around activated components, was used to provide high resolution maps of dose rate distributions in the test tank room, the docking room and the service room, assuming an activated diagnostic generic equatorial port plug (GEPP) module in the PPTF. The results show that the shielding is not enough with the preliminary PPTF and rooms design. A design optimization was performed in order to improve the radiation shielding around the PPTF. The results show that with an optimized design dose rates less than 25 mu Sv/h can be achieved in the docking room and the service room. (C) 2015 Haibo Liu. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Modeling an unmitigated thermal quench event in a large field magnet in a DEMO reactor	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	28th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 29-OCT 03, 2014	San Sebastian, SPAIN	Spanish Res Ctr Energy Environm & Technol		Fusion safety; Unmitigated quench; Magnet accident		The superconducting magnet systems of future fusion reactors, such as a demonstration power plant (DEMO), will produce magnetic field energies in the 10 s of GJ range. The release of this energy during a fault condition could produce arcs that can damage the magnets of these systems. The public safety consequences of such events must be explored for a DEMO reactor because the magnets are located near the DEMO's primary radioactive confinement barrier, the reactor's vacuum vessel (VV). Great care will be taken in the design of DEMO's magnet systems to detect and provide a rapid field energy dump to avoid any accidents conditions. During an event when a fault condition proceeds undetected, the potential of producing melting of the magnet exists. If molten material from the magnet impinges on the walls of the W, these walls could fail, resulting in a pathway for release of radioactive material from the VV. A model is under development at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) called MAGARC to investigate the consequences of this accident in a large toroidal field (TF) coil. Recent improvements to this model are described in this paper, along with predictions for a DEMO relevant event in a toroidal field magnet. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Revisiting the analysis of passive plasma shutdown during an ex-vessel loss of coolant accident in ITER blanket	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	28th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 29-OCT 03, 2014	San Sebastian, SPAIN	Spanish Res Ctr Energy Environm & Technol		ITER; Safety; LOCA; Beryllium; Plasma shutdown		In this contribution, the analysis of passive safety during an ex-vessel loss of coolant accident (LOCA) in the first wall/shield blanket of ITER has been studied with AINA safety code. In the past, this case has been studied using robust safety arguments, based on simple OD models for plasma balance equations and 10 models for wall heat transfer. The conclusion was that, after first wall heating up due to the loss of all coolant, the beryllium evaporation in the wall surface would induce a growing impurity flux into core plasma that finally would end in a passive shut down of the discharge. The analysis of plasma-wall transients in this work is based in results from AINA code simulations. AINA (Analyses of IN vessel Accidents) code is a safety code developed at Fusion Energy Engineering Laboratory (FEEL) in Barcelona. It uses a 0D/1D architecture, similar to that used for past analyses. Initial results show good agreement with previous studies, plasma shutdown happens before significant melting occurs in first wall. However, after a parametric survey a new scenario was identified with the potential not only to melt beryllium but also the copper heat sink. If the coolant tubes were compromised in such scenario, the in-vessel radioactive inventory could be mobilized. http://nerg.upc.edu/ (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Rivas, J.

The high level of neutron flux required for tritium breeding and the neutron multiplication properties of Be and Pb imply the need for a large neutron attenuation in the associated shielding to meet the shutdown dose requirements. A new SEACAB methodology has been developed to apply the rigorous two-step method with the use of the mesh tally of MCNPX and activation code ACAB and it has been qualified with the results of the 2nd campaign of the "duct-experiment" performed with Frascati Neutron Generator in a block of steel and moderator layers with a central cavity where the residual photon flux and dose were measured.

The main initiating events have been identified, and accident sequences have been studied. A deterministic assessment of the main accidental sequences has been performed. The consequences of the radioactive environmental releases have been assessed by means of a population dose code. This paper analyzes the deterministic consequences of two accidental sequences, serving as the "design basis accidents" because of the extent of radioactive release involved, either outside or inside the building. The two sequences with higher releases have been considered. The deterministic analysis has achieved the following results: the Ignitor machine, both during routine operation and accidental sequences, presents a negligible environmental impact and radiological risk.

A Submillimeter Resolution PET Prototype Evaluated With an F-18 Inkjet Printed Phantom	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						MPPC; PET; radioactive printing; SiPM	SCANNER	This work presents a submillimeter resolution PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scanner prototype based on SiPM/MPPC arrays (Silicon Photomultiplier/Multi Pixel Photon Counter). Onto each active area a 1 x 1 x 20 mm(3) LYSO (Lutetium-Yttrium-Oxyorthosilicate) scintillator crystal is coupled one-to-one. Two detector modules facing each other in a distance of 10.0 cm have been set up with in total 64 channels that are digitized by SADCs (Sampling Analog to Digital Converters) with 80 MHz, 10 bit resolution and FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) based extraction of energy and time information. Since standard phantoms are not sufficient for testing submillimeter resolution at which positron range is an issue, a F-18 inkjet printed phantom has been used to explore the limit in spatial resolution. The phantom could be successfully reconstructed with an iterative MLEM (Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization) and an analytically calculated system matrix based on the DRF (Detector Response Function) model. The system yields a coincidence time resolution of 4.8 ns FWHM, an energy resolution of 20%-30% FWHM and a spatial resolution of 0.8 mm.

For the process, a highly active hydrophobic catalyst is needed. This study provides an effective fabrication method of size-controlled platinum/poly[styrene-divinylbenzene-tri(propylene glycol) diacrylate] [Pt/poly(SDB-TPGDA)] hydrophobic catalyst beads with a narrow size distribution. Platinum nanoparticles were prepared by g-ray-induced reduction in the aqueous phase first, and then uniformly dispersed in SDB-TPGDA comonomer after the hydrophobization of platinum nanoparticles with alkylamine stabilizers. The porous Pt/poly(SDB-TPGDA) hydrophobic catalyst beads were synthesized by the UV-initiated polymerization of the mixture droplets prepared in a capillary-based microfluidic system. The size of as-prepared catalyst beads can be controlled in the range of 200-1,000 mu m by adjusting the flow rate of dispersed and continuous phases, as well as the viscosity of the continuous phase. Sorbitan monooleate and cyclohexanol were used as coporogens to control the porosities of the catalyst beads. Copyright (C) 2015, Published by Elsevier Korea LLC on behalf of Korean Nuclear Society.

The interior and exterior structures of the ACPF hot cell have been modified under the current renovation project for the experimentation of the electrolytic reduction process using spent nuclear fuel. The most important aspect of this renovation was the installation of the argon compartment within the hot cell. Method: For the design and system implementation of the argon compartment system, a full-scale mock-up test and a three-dimensional (3D) simulation test were conducted in advance. The remodeling and repairing of the process cell (M8a), the maintenance cell (M8b), the isolation room, and their utilities were also planned through this simulation to accommodate the designed argon compartment system. Results and conclusion: Based on the considered refurbishment workflow, previous equipment in the M8 cell, including vessels and pipes, were removed and disposed of successfully after a zoning smear survey and decontamination, and new equipment with advanced functions and specifications were installed in the hot cell. Finally, the operating area and isolation room were also refurbished to meet the requirements of the improved hot cell facility.

AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF THE HELIUM-COOLED MODULAR DIVERTOR WITH MULTIPLE JETS AT NEARLY PROTOTYPICAL CONDITIONS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	21st American-Nuclear-Society (ANS) Topical Meeting on the Technology of Fusion Energy (TOFE)	NOV 10-13, 2014	Anaheim, CA	Amer Nucl Soc, US Dept Energy, Off Fusion Energy Sci			THERMAL PERFORMANCE	A new helium (He) loop was used to study the helium-cooled modular divertor with multiple jets (HEMJ) at incident heat fluxes q" <= 6.6 MW/m(2) as part of the joint US-Japan effort on plasma-facing components evaluation by tritium plasma, heat, and neutron irradiation experiments (PHENIX). These studies were performed at prototypical pressures of 10 MPa and inlet temperatures ranging from 30 degrees C to 300 degrees C. The effect of varying the distance between the inner jets cartridge and the outer shell from 0.44 to 0.9 mm was also investigated. The Nusselt number (Nu) over bar results for two different tungsten-alloy test sections were in good agreement for q" = 1.5-6.6 MW/m(2). The experiments also suggest that the loss coefficient K-L, is essentially constant. These (Nu) over bar and K-L/n, results were used to estimate the maximum heat flux q"max that can be accommodated by the divertor under prototypical conditions and the coolant pumping power as a fraction of the incident thermal power beta. The agreement over the broad range of experimental parameters studied suggests that these results at near-prototypical conditions can be extrapolated with reasonable confidence to the operating conditions expected for the HEMJ design.

One is the hydrophobic platinum catalyst on a metal honeycomb. The other is the hydrophobic platinum catalyst on a ceramic honeycomb made of silicon carbide. The activity of these catalysts was evaluated with tritium. The effects of hydrogen concentration (0.02 to 1000 ppm) and water concentration (100 or 22000 ppm) in the gaseous feed on the activity were investigated. The fine platinum particles around a few nanometers significantly improve the catalytic activity for the oxidation tritium at a very small concentration. The hydrogen concentration in the gaseous feed slightly affects the overall reaction rate constant for hydrogen oxidation. Due to the competitive adsorption of hydrogen and water molecules on platinum surface, the overall reaction rate constant has the bottom value at the hydrogen concentration of 100 ppm with the dry feed gas. We have experimentally confirmed the activity of these honeycomb catalysts is as good as that of granular hydrophobic catalyst. The results support the hydrophobic honeycomb catalysts can be used for tritium oxidation reactors.

Measured neutron flux parameters in the USGS TRIGA MARK I reactor	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Westcott convention; TRIGA reactor; Neutron spectrum characterization; SAND-II-SNL; Spectrum unfolding	UNIVERSAL CURVE; SPHERES; WIRES; FOILS	Using the Westcott convention, the Westcott flux, phi(w); modified spectral index, r root T-n/T-0; neutron temperature, T-n; and gold-based cadmium ratios were determined for various sampling positions in the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Training, Research, Isotopes, General Atomic (TRIGA) Mark I reactor. Westcott parameters were determined by a bare multi-monitor method. Thermal-neutron temperature measurements were made using lutetium foils. The differential neutron energy spectrum measurement was obtained using the computer iterative code SAND-II-SNL. Measurement of the neutron spectrum has resulted in a better knowledge of the reactor core and will improve predictive radioisotope production calculations necessary for neutron activation analysis and medical isotope production.
