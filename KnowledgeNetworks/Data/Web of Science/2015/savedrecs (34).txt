J	Haschke, JM; Dinh, LN; McLean, W				Haschke, John M.; Dinh, Long N.; McLean, William, II			The plutonium-oxygen phase diagram in the 25-900 degrees C range: Non-existence of the PuO1.515 phase	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							OXIDATION	Evaluation of data for phases formed in the Pu-O system at temperatures below 900 degrees C shows that the observed oxides are not at equilibrium. Results are consistent with coexistence of a hexagonal solid solution (hex-PuO1.5+z, 0 <= z <= 0.010) and a cubic phase (cub-PuO1.60) in equilibrium at 800 degrees C, but fail to confirm that the O/Pu ratio of the body-centered-cubic (bcc) oxide formed near the sesquioxide composition is 1.515 (1.52) or that bcc-PuO1.515 is formed by the peritectic reaction of hex-PuO1.510 with cub-PuO1.60. Stable Pu(IV)/Pu(III) ratios observed for products of the Pu-H2O reaction correspond to members of the PunO2n-2 homologous series, but a product is not formed at O/Pu = 1.515. Metastable bcc-PuO1.50 (n = 4) and stable hex-PuO1.5+z coexist below 285 degrees C, the point at which reversible eutectic decomposition of cubic PuO1.60 (n = 5) produces a non-equilibrium mixture of bcc-PuO1.50 and sub-stoichiometric dioxide (PuO2-y). Transformation of bcc-PuO1.50 to stable hex-PuO1.50 and reactions of the hexagonal oxide to form higher-composition cubic phases are kinetically hindered. An alternative diagram describing non-equilibrium chemical behavior of the Pu-O system is presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

J	Yuan, K; Ewing, RC; Becker, U				Yuan, Ke; Ewing, Rodney C.; Becker, Udo			Thermodynamic mixing properties of the UO2-HfO2 solid solution: Density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							PHASE-TRANSITIONS; SYSTEM UO2-ZRO2; ZIRCONIA-HAFNIA; HFO2; PRINCIPLES; ZRO2	HfO2 is a neutron absorber and has been mechanically mixed with UO2 in nuclear fuel in order to control the core power distribution. During nuclear fission, the temperature at the center of the fuel pellet can reach above 1300 K, where hafnium may substitute uranium and form the binary solid solution of UO2-HfO2. UO2 adopts the cubic fluorite structure, but HfO2 can occur in monoclinic, tetragonal, and cubic structures. The distribution of Hf and U ions in the UO2-HfO2 binary and its atomic structure influence the thermal conductivity and melting point of the fuel. However, experimental data on the UO2-HfO2 binary are limited. Therefore, the enthalpies of mixing of the UO2-HfO2 binary with three different structures were calculated in this study using density functional theory and subsequent Monte Carlo simulations. The free energy of mixing was obtained from thermodynamic integration of the enthalpy of mixing over temperature. From the DG of mixing, a phase diagram of the binary was obtained. The calculated UO2-HfO2 binary forms extensive solid solution across the entire compositional range, but there are a variety of possible exsolution phenomena associated with the different HfO2 polymorphs. As the structure of the HfO2 end member adopts lower symmetry and becomes less similar to cubic UO2, the miscibility gap of the phase diagram expands, accompanied by an increase in cell volume by 7-10% as the structure transforms from cubic to monoclinic. Close to the UO2 end member, which is relevant to the nuclear fuel, the isometric uranium-rich solid solutions exsolve as the fuel cools, and there is a tendency to form the monoclinic hafnium-rich phase in the matrix of the isometric, uranium-rich solid solution phase.

Investigation of point defects diffusion in bcc uranium and U-Mo alloys	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							EN PHASE-GAMMA; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; SELF-DIFFUSION; MOLYBDENUM ALLOY; LAUTODIFFUSION; COEFFICIENTS; POTENTIALS; ETUDE; FUEL; IRRADIATION	We present results of investigation of point defects formation and diffusion in pure gamma-U and gamma-U-Mo fuel alloys. The study was performed using molecular dynamics simulation with the different interatomic potentials. The point defects formation and migration energies were estimated for bcc gamma-U and U9 wt.%Mo alloy. The calculated diffusivities of atoms via defects are provided for pure gamma-U and for the alloy components. Analysis of simulation results shows that self-interstitial atoms play a leading role in the self-diffusion processes in the materials studied. This fact can explain a remarkably high self-diffusion mobility observed experimentally for gamma-U. The self-diffusion coefficients in gamma-U calculated in this assumption agree with the data measured experimentally. It is shown that alloying of gamma-U with Mo increase formation energy for self-interstitial atoms and decelerate their mobility. These changes lead to decrease of self-diffusion coefficients in U-Mo alloy compared to pure U. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Smirnova, D. E.; Kuksin, A. Yu.; Starikov, S.

Raman micro-spectroscopy of UOX and MOX spent nuclear fuel characterization and oxidation resistance of the high burn-up structure	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							URANIUM-DIOXIDE; SOLID-SOLUTIONS; PHASE-DIAGRAM; OXIDES; TEMPERATURES; DISSOLUTION; REACTIVITY	Raman micro-spectroscopy was applied to study the structure and oxidation resistance of UO2 (burnup 60 GWd/tHM) and MOX (burnup 47 GWd/tHM) irradiated fuels. The Raman technique, adapted to working under extreme conditions, enabled structural information to be obtained at the cubic micrometer scale in various zones of interest within irradiated fuel (central and zones like the Rim for UOX60, and the plutonium-enriched agglomerates for MOX47 characterized by a high burn-up structure), and the study of their oxidation resistance. As regards the structural information after irradiation, the spectra obtained make up a set of data consistent with the systematic presence of the T-2g band characteristic of the fluorite structure, and of a triplet band located between 500 and 700 cm(-1). The existence of this triplet can be attributed to the presence of defects originating in changes to the fuel chemistry occurring in the reactor (presence of fission products) and to the accumulation of irradiation damage. As concerns the oxidation resistance of the different zones of interest, Raman spectroscopy results confirmed the good stability of the restructured zones (plutonium-enriched agglomerates and Rim) rich in fission products compared to the non-restructured UO2 grains. A greater structural stability was noticed in the case of high plutonium content agglomerates, as this element favors the maintenance of the fluorite structure. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Raman shifts of UH3 and UD3 are evident to be inversely proportional to the square root of the mass of hydrogen isotope. The typical Raman peaks of UH3 and UD3 can be characterized by the mass difference of hydrogen isotope for one another. In addition, Raman peaks of uranium hydride and deuteride are identified to be at 725 and 938 cm(-1) for UH3 and 518 and 669 cm(-1) for UD3, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Fuel swelling and interaction layer formation in the SELENIUM Si and ZrN coated U(Mo) dispersion fuel plates irradiated at high power in BR2	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							E-FUTURE PLATES; U-MO ALLOY; NONDESTRUCTIVE ANALYSES; AL; MOLYBDENUM; PRODUCT	In the framework of the SELENIUM project two full size flat fuel plates were produced with respectively Si and ZrN coated U(Mo) particles and irradiated in the BR2 reactor at SCK center dot CEN. Non-destructive analysis of the plates showed that the fuel swelling profiles of both SELENIUM plates were very similar to each other and none of the plates showed signs of pillowing or excessive swelling at the end of irradiation at the highest power position (local maximum 70% U-235). The microstructural analysis showed that the Si coated fuel has less interaction phase formation at low burn-up but at the highest burn-ups, defects start to develop on the IL-matrix interface. The ZrN coated fuel, shows a virtual absence of reaction between the U(Mo) and the Al, up to high fission densities after which the interaction layer formation starts and defects develop in the matrix near the U(Mo) particles. It was found and is confirmed by the SELENIUM (Surface Engineering of Low ENrIched Uranium-Molybdenum) experiment that there are two phenomena at play that need to be controlled: the formation of an interaction layer and swelling of the fuel. As the interaction layer formation occurs at the U(Mo)-matrix interface, applying a diffusion barrier (coating) at that interface should prevent the interaction between U(Mo) and the matrix. The U(Mo) swelling, observed to proceed at an accelerating rate with respect to fission density accumulation, is governed by linear solid state swelling and fission gas bubble swelling due to recrystallization of the fuel. The examination of the SELENIUM fuel plates clearly show that for the U(Mo) dispersion fuel to be qualified, the swelling rate at high burn-up needs to be reduced. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Characterising the U-Nd-O miscibility gap by an experimental and a theoretical approach	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							2-SUBLATTICE MODEL; FISSION-PRODUCTS; SOLID-SOLUTION; PHASE-DIAGRAM; URANIUM; SYSTEM; OXIDE; TEMPERATURE; NEODYMIUM; OXYGEN	Recent studies performed on (U-1 (y), Nd-y)O-2 highlighted the existence of a miscibility gap in this mixed oxide. The objective of this work is to describe this miscibility gap by means of two types of approaches: experimental and theoretical. The first approach involves a set of SEM analyses combined to XRD characterisations. The second approach consists in the thermodynamic assessment of the U-Nd-O ternary system using the CALPHAD method. A good agreement is obtained between the calculated and experimental data for Nd/(U + Nd) ratios from 3% to 28%. Both results show that this miscibility gap appears preferentially when the O/M ratio is less than two and when the Nd atomic fraction of the sample is higher than 0.04. This confirms that the existence of the miscibility gap in neodymium UO2 doped ceramics is consistent with the phase diagram calculated on the basis of a thermodynamic model. Finally, we discuss the conditions leading to the appearance of the miscibility gap with respect to the fabrication process. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

One concept utilizes U-7 wt.% Mo (U-7Mo) fuel particles dispersed in Al matrix, where the fuel particles are coated with a 1 mu m-thick ZrN coating. The ZrN serves as a diffusion barrier to eliminate a deleterious reaction that can occur between U-7Mo and Al when a dispersion fuel is irradiated under aggressive reactor conditions. To investigate the final microstructure of a physically-vapor-deposited ZrN coating in a dispersion fuel plate after it was fabricated using a rolling process, characterization samples were taken from a fuel plate that was fabricated at 500 degrees C using ZrN-coated U-7Mo particles, Al matrix and AA6061 cladding. Scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy analysis were performed. Data from these analyses will be used to support future microstructural examinations of irradiated fuel plates, in terms of understanding the effects of irradiation on the ZrN microstructure, and to determine the role of diffusion barrier microstructure in eliminating fuel/matrix interactions during irradiation. The as-fabricated coating was determined to be cubic-ZrN (cF8) phase. It exhibited a columnar microstructure comprised of nanometer-sized grains and a region of relatively high porosity, mainly near the Al matrix. Small impurity-containing phases were observed at the U-7Mo/ZrN interface, and no interaction zone was observed at the ZrN/Al interface. The bonding between the U-7Mo and ZrN appeared to be mechanical in nature. A relatively high level of oxygen was observed in the ZrN coating, extending from the Al matrix in the ZrN coating in decreasing concentration. The above microstructural characteristics are discussed in terms of what may be most optimal for a diffusion barrier in a dispersion fuel plate application. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The Pu-U-Am system: An ab initio informed CALPHAD thermodynamic study	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							PHASE-TRANSFORMATIONS; AMERICIUM-URANIUM; THERMO-CALC; PLUTONIUM; ALLOYS; ZR	Phase diagram and thermodynamic properties of the Am-U system, that are experimentally unknown, are calculated using the CALPHAD method with input from ab initio electronic-structure calculations for the fcc and bcc phases. A strong tendency toward phase separation across the whole composition range is predicted. In addition, ab initio informed Pu-U and Am-Pu thermodynamic assessments are combined to build a Pu-U-Am thermodynamic database. Regarding the Pu-rich corner of the ternary system, predictions indicate that Am acts as a powerful delta-Pu (fcc) stabilizer. In the U-rich corner, similar predictions are made but to a lesser extent. In both cases, the bcc phase is destabilized and the fcc phase is enhanced. Finally, results and methodology are discussed and compared with previous assessments and guidelines are provided for further experimental studies. Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Perron, A.; Turchi, P.

Uranium trioxide behavior during electron energy loss spectroscopy analysis	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Uranium trioxide; Reduction; Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Transmission electron microscopy	UO3; SYSTEM	A sample of uranium trioxide (UO3) was produced by focused ion beam (similar to 10 mu m x similar to 10 mu m x <0.5 mu m) for transmission electron and electron energy loss (EEL) spectroscopy examinations in a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The EEL spectra were recorded as a function of the thickness for the P and O edges in the low energy range 0-350 eV and were compared to spectra of UO3 small grains attached to a TEM grid. The EEL spectrum was studied through a range of thicknesses going from similar to 60 to similar to 260 nm. The EEL spectra recorded for UO3 are compared with those recorded for UO2. The reduction of UO3 into U4O9 and/or UO2 is readily observed apparently during the TEM investigations and as confirmed by electron diffraction (eD). This redox effect is similar to that known for other redox sensitive oxides. Recommendations are suggested to avoid sample decomposition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Preliminary thermal-hydraulic safety analysis of Tehran research reactor during fuel irradiation experiment	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Thermal-hydraulic; Irradiation experiment; Safety; Tehran research reactor; Mixed-core		Following domestic fabrication of nuclear fuels in Iran, it is necessary to investigate fuel material behavior, fission gas release, fuel swelling, cladding material behavior and fuel integrity of domestic fuels at different burnup in a research reactor during irradiation. Currently, Tehran research reactor is the sole operating research reactor which can be used for fuel irradiation experiments in the country. In this regard, standard codes as well as developed complementary computer programs are applied to verify thermal-hydraulic performance of irradiating a domestic rod-type fuel assembly of natural UO2 pellets in Tehran research reactor core, which itself contains 20% enriched plate-type U3O8-Al fuels. Maximum temperatures of fuel, clad and coolant, onset of nucleate boiling, onset of flow instability and departure from nucleate boiling during irradiation experiment are investigated by subchannel analysis as indicators to verify the reactor core safe operation during the experiment. The results give the confidence that during this irradiation experiment, thermal-hydraulic steady state safety criteria of the mixed-core are satisfied and the fuel irradiation experiment does not induce any significant operational change.

J	Xiong, ZQ; Ye, C; Wang, ML; Gu, HY				Xiong, Zhenqin; Ye, Cheng; Wang, Minglu; Gu, Hanyang			Experimental study on the sub-atmospheric loop heat pipe passive cooling system for spent fuel pool	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Heat pipe; Heat transfer rate; Spent fuel pool; Transient state; Periodic state mode		As one kind of the natural circulation cooling system, loop heat pipe is promising in improving the safety of the nuclear power station since it is passive and has no electricity driven components. A novel heat pipe cooling system is designed for passively removing the residual heat released by the spent fuel stored in the spent fuel pool (SFP) under the accidental conditions such as the station blackout. This system is characterized by its large-diameter and long-length evaporator. Its working fluid is water and it's sub-atmospheric. To test such system's heat transfer performance and get to know its thermo-fluid dynamics, a test facility for a simplified heat pipe made of one evaporator tube and one condenser has been developed. The heat transfer rate of the simplified heat pipe is obtained in a wide range of conditions covering the potential working conditions in spent fuel pool. Moreover, it's found that heat pipe with such a large-diameter and long-length evaporator is vulnerable to be unstable. The periodic state mode is more likely to happen when the heat source temperature, the air velocity or the volumetric filling ratio is low. Furthermore, the effects of hot water temperature, the air velocity and the filling ratio of the water in the circulation system have been analyzed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Development of high-performance heavy density concrete using different aggregates for gamma-ray shielding	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Heavyweight aggregates; High-performance concrete; Linear attenuation coefficient (mu); Half-value layer (HVL); Tenth-value layer (TVL)	ATTENUATION	Primary and secondary containment structures are the major components of the nuclear power plant (NPP). The performance requirements of the concrete of containment structures are mainly radiological protection, structural integrity and durability, etc. For this purpose, high-performance heavy density concrete with special attributes can be used. The aggregate of concrete plays an essential role in modifying concrete properties and the physico-mechanical properties of the concrete affect significantly on its shielding properties. After extensive trials and errors, 15 concrete mixes were prepared by using the coarse aggregates of barite, magnetite, goethite and serpentine along with addition of 10% silica fume (SF), 20% fly ash (FA) and 30% ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBFS) to the total content of OPC for each mix. To achieve the high-performance concrete (HPC- grade M60), All concrete mixes had a constant water/cement ratio of 0.35, cement content of 450 kg/m(3) and sand-to-total aggregate ratio of 40%. Concrete density has been measured in the case of fresh and hardened. The hardened concrete mixes were tested for compressive strength at 7, 28 and 90 days. In some concrete mixes, compressive strength was also tested up to 90 days upon replacing sand with the fine portions of magnetite, barite and goethite. The attenuation measurements were performed by using gamma spectrometer of NaI (Tl) scintillation detector. The utilized radiation sources comprised Cs-137 and Co-60 radioactive elements with photon energies of 0.662 MeV for Cs-137 and two energy levels of 1.173 and 1.333 MeV for Co-60. Some shielding factors were measured such as half-value layer (HVL), tenth-value layer (TVL) and linear attenuation coefficients (mu). Experimental results revealed that, the concrete mixes containing magnetite coarse aggregate along with 10% SF reaches the highest compressive strength values exceeding over the M60 requirement by 14% after 28 days of curing. Whereas, the compressive strength of concrete containing barite aggregate was very close to M60 and exceeds upon continuing for 90 days. The results indicated also that, the compressive strength of the high-performance heavy density concrete incorporating magnetite as fine aggregate was significantly higher than that containing sand by 23%. Also, concrete made with magnetite fine aggregate improved the Physico-mechanical properties than the corresponding concrete containing barite and goethite. Therefore, high-performance concrete incorporating magnetite as fine aggregate enhances the shielding efficiency against gamma-rays. (C) 2014 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Assessment of safety aspects of first rod-type fuel irradiation at Tehran research reactor, Part I: Neutronic analysis	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Neutronic study; Irradiation experiment; Safety; Research reactor		Following domestic fabrication of nuclear fuels in Iran, the need to investigate fuel behavior at different burnup with regard to fission gas release, fuel swelling, cladding material behavior and fuel integrity necessitates in-pile tests irradiation in research reactors. Currently, Tehran research reactor is the sole operating research reactor which can be used for fuel irradiation experiments in the country. This is Part! of the articles describing the details of Tehran research reactor core performance during a fuel irradiation experiment. This first part of the article series is aimed at evaluating the potential capability of Tehran research reactor core to conduct nuclear fuel test during irradiation from the neutronic point of view. A neutronic study on the feasibility of irradiating a rod-type fuel assembly of natural UO2 pellets in the Tehran research reactor core, which itself contains 20% enriched plate-type U3O8-Al fuels, is presented in this paper. The feasibility study is performed by calculating safety related neutronic parameters of the core, i.e., excess reactivity, shutdown margin, reactivity worth of the test fuel, safety reactivity factor and power peaking factors, during irradiation experiment using MCNPX nuclear code. Comparing obtained results to the permissible limits reported in the final safety analysis report of the reactor indicates that this irradiation experiment will not induce any reduction of the reactor safety.

MCNP6 simulations of gamma line emissions from fission products and their comparisons to plutonium and uranium measurements	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						MCNP6; Delayed gamma; Special nuclear materials	ENERGY; SIGNATURES; SPECTRA; PART	Aqueous solutions containing microgram quantities of special nuclear materials (SNMs) were irradiated for 60 s using a SLOWPOKE-2 reactor, and their delayed gamma (DG) emissions were recorded as a function of count time up to three minutes after irradiation. The irradiation and counting processes were simulated using the production release of MCNP6.1 and the more recent MCNP6.1.1 beta version, and the line emission option was used to create DGs. In every simulation MCNP6 successfully predicted the 25 most prominent measured fission product peaks for each SNM solution in the 0.1-1.6 MeV energy range. Fission products with gamma emissions greater than 0.6 MeV were selected for a detailed comparison of their relative measured and simulated magnitudes. There were significant fission product peak outliers, several of which were attributed to the outdated ENDF/B VI gamma line data used by MCNP6 for DG emissions. The updated time-bin structure used by MCNP6.1.1 beta for DG production and its effect on time-dependent measurements are also discussed. Discrepancies between measurements and simulations were further resolved in a final comparison which used MCNP6.1.1 beta alongside updated gamma line data files. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Ground deposition assessment of radionuclides following a hypothetical release from Ghana Research Reactor-1 (GHARR-1) using atmospheric dispersion model	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Hypothetical; Radiological; Meteorological; Source term; Gaussian		With the sustained development in computer technology, the possibilities of code capabilities have been enlarged substantially. Advanced safety evaluations and design optimizations that were not possible few years ago can now be performed. There is a challenge today in assessing radiological dose from nuclear reactor using a more reliable computer tool in addressing the released radionuclide to the atmosphere and ground effectively and to compute the dose rates. As such the dealing of atmospheric dispersion of radionuclide release from a nuclear facility has become very imperative. This has enhanced the idea of revisiting the safety features of the existing nuclear plants and particularly research reactors. One of such kind of research reactors whose safety is of concern now is the 30 kW Ghana Research Reactor-1 (GHARR-1) which uses a Highly Enrich Uranium (HEU) fuel. In connection with conversion of GHARR-1 from HEU fuel to the use of Low Enrich Uranium (LEU) fuel; assessment of a postulated radiological dose from possible radionuclides released using computer technology is essential. An effective computer model which is based on a reliable atmospheric transport and dispersion theory can help address such drawbacks. Atmospheric dispersion modeling and radiological safety analysis were performed for a postulated accident scenario of the HEU fuel of the GHARR-1 core. The simulation was performed using a reliable health physics atmospheric dispersion code called HotSpot. The HotSpot code which employs a Gaussian plume technique was used to perform the atmospheric transport modeling which was then applied to determine the ground deposition of radionuclides and to estimate the Total Effective Dose Equivalent (TEDE) of release radionuclides. The source term was generated from an inventory of peak radioisotope activities released by using the Oak Ridge isotope generation code ORIGEN-2. The adopted methodology used was based on the predominant site-specific meteorological data. Some selected radionuclides were evaluated to prove whether their release may have radiological effect on the public. Nonetheless, prudence requires assessing the effect on the public during such events. The results indicate that the maximum ground deposition value of 1.5E-04 kBq/m(2) occurred at 96 m distance and the maximum TEDE value of 1.9E-02 mSv occurred at 93 m from the reactor. It was observed that the values were far below the NRC acceptable limit of the 0.1 rem (1 mSv) for the public in a year even in the event of worse accident scenario. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Kebwaro, JM; Zhao, YL; He, CH				Kebwaro, Jeremiah Monari; Zhao, Yaolin; He, Chaohui			Evaluation of candidate materials for SCWR turbine and balance of plant shielding	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						SCWR ex-core shielding; Shielding materials; Gamma attenuation; Photo-neutron production	LIGHT-WATER REACTOR; ATTENUATION COEFFICIENTS; CONCRETE; NEUTRON; BARITE; GAMMA; DESIGN; CORE	Since the coolant leaving the SCWR core contains an assortment of radioisotopes, it is necessary to identify appropriate materials for shielding ex-core components. Photon attenuation characteristics, photo-neutron production capacity and cost effectiveness of candidate materials were investigated in this study. WinXcom computer code was used for attenuation studies while other properties were surveyed in literature. High Z materials (lead and tungsten) show excellent gamma attenuation properties however they are expensive and could be vulnerable to photo-neutron production if used for shielding turbines or the pressure vessel exit steam-line. Barite concrete which is a moderate attenuator could also be susceptible to photo-neutron production if used for shielding components with high Nitrogen-16 activity. Heavy concretes with iron aggregates on the other hand show fair attenuation and are not susceptible to photo-neutron production in the energy range of photons released from reactor water. In terms of cost, concretes are cheaper and easy to fabricate compared to high Z materials especially when a shield of intricate shape is required. Depending on the available space for the shield, heavy concretes would be the most appropriate materials for shielding the SCWR turbine and balance of plant. However in case of space limitation, their attenuation capacity can be enhanced by introducing high Z materials in reasonable proportions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The conventional sum-peak method is one of the absolute radioactivity measurement methods for radionuclides emitting more than one photon in coincidence. The method requires the knowledge of the total count rate as well as the peak count rates and the sum peak count rate. If there are other radionuclides in a sample, it is fraught with difficulty to estimate the total count rate of the nuclide of interest. To solve the problem, a novel calculation method solely using the peak count rates and the sum peak count rate was developed by modifying the conventional sum-peak method. The new method was theoretically verified and experimentally investigated using Co-60 and Na-22, and was successfully confirmed. It was proved that the modified sum-peak method is effective to measure samples with multiple radionuclides and is quite simple and practical. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Meticulously clean sample preparation methods combined with anion exchange separations for analyte pre-concentration and matrix removal were developed. Quantification was performed by isotope dilution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Detection limits of 0.0084 pg Th-232/g (0.034 mu Bq Th-232/kg) and 0.0106 pg U-238/g (0.131 mu Bq U-238/kg) were determined for copper, while detection limits of 0.23 pg Th-232/g (0.94 mu Bq Th-232/kg) and 0.46 pg U-238/g (5.7 mu Bq U-238/kg) were achieved for lead. These methods allow the Majorana Collaboration to accurately assay detector components and ensure that the experiment's stringent radiopurity requirements are met. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The responses of the photodiocles to illumination with an Fe-55 radioisotope X-ray source were measured using a low noise charge sensitive preamplifier; the energy resolutions measured with the devices were consistent with each other and had a mean FWHM at 5.9 keV of 1.27 keV. The devices are the thickest (highest detection efficiency) AlGaAs X-ray spectroscopic mesa photodiodes reported in the literature to date.

Transverse divergence in target normal sheath acceleration of a thick contamination layer	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Laser-plasma interaction; Laser-driven proton acceleration; Plasma expansion; Fluid mechanics; TNSA	LASER; PLASMA	The divergence of the ion beams accelerated via Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) is investigated using a particle-in-cell plasma simulation code. A semi-analytical model is derived and validated by 2D simulations. The proton divergence is determined analytically at the end of the well-understood isothermal phase of the plasma expansion. In order to find the final velocity distribution the adiabatic phase of the acceleration is modeled as well. An analytical expression is given for the energy-dependent half envelope angle of a proton beam, which can be extended into three dimensions by assuming an axial symmetric distribution of the hot electrons. The model is also compared with experimental data, a good agreement in the energy dependent divergence is observed.

Study of radioactive impurities in neutron transmutation doped germanium	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Neutron transmutation doping; Radioactive impurities; gamma-Rays		A program to develop low temperature (mK) sensors with neutron transmutation doped Ge for rare event studies with a cryogenic bolometer has been initiated. For this purpose, semiconductor grade Ge wafers are irradiated with thermal neutron flux from Dhruva reactor at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Mumbai. Spectroscopic studies of irradiated samples have revealed that the environment of the capsule used for irradiating the sample leads to significant levels of Zn-65, Ag-110m and Ta-182 impurities, which can be reduced by chemical etching of approximately similar to 50 mu m thick surface layer. From measurements of the etched samples in the low background counting setup, activity due to trace impurities of Sb-123 in bulk a is estimated to be similar to 1 Bq/g after irradiation. These estimates indicate that in order W use the NTD a sensors for rare event studies, a cooldown period of similar to 2 years would be necessary to reduce the radioactive background to <= 1 mBq/g.

A GPM based on THGEM made of PTFE (herein named PTFE-THGEM) was developed inspired by the wide use of PTFE (polytetrafluoroethene) boards as low radioactive background PCB in rare event experiments. The efficiencies of the THGEM, a Csl photocathode, and finally a GPM are presented here. At low temperature (113 K) and 1.1 atm, the quantum efficiency of the GPM for VUV photons from liquid At in a two-phase detector is estimated to be 8.1% and the low threshold of the detector system for initial electrons prior to multiplication is 12 using 5 N purity Ar (0.99999).

For the nuclear model calculations, the Talys 1.6 code were used, which is the latest version of Talys code series. Calculations of excitation functions for production of the I122-125 isotopes were carried out by using the generalized superfluid model (GSM) and Fermi-gas model (FGM). The results have shown that generalized superfluid model is more successful than Fermi-gas model in explaining the experimental results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Croft, S; Favalli, A; Henzlova, D; Santi, PA				Croft, S.; Favalli, A.; Henzlova, D.; Santi, P. A.			On the equivalence of the RTI and SVM approaches to time correlated analysis	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Time correlation analysis; Neutron multiplicity counting; Neutron auto-correlation analysis	EXTRACTION	Recently two papers on how to perform passive neutron auto correlation analysis on time gated histograms formed from pulse train data, generically called time correlation analysis (TCA), have appeared in this journal Dubi et al. Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A. Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment (673) (2012) 111; Croft et al. Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A. Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment (691) (2012) 152. For those of us working in international nuclear safeguards these treatments are of particular interest because passive neutron multiplicity counting is a widely deployed technique for the quantification of plutonium. The purpose of this letter is to show that the skewness-variance-mean (SVM) approach developed in Dubi et al. (Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment (673) (2012) 111) is equivalent in terms of assay capability to the random trigger interval (RTI) analysis laid out in Croft et al. Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment (691) (2012) 152. Mathematically we could also use other numerical ways to extract the time correlated information from the histogram data including, for example, what we might call the mean, mean square, and mean cube approach. The important feature however, from the perspective of real world applications, is that the correlated information extracted is the same, and subsequently gets interpreted in the same way based on the same underlying physics model.

The basic idea is to use nuclear transmutation induced by a neutron capture reaction followed by a beta(-) decay, thus changing the atomic number Z of a target element in fission products by 1 unit. LWR (PWR) and FBR (MONJU) were considered as the transmutation devices. High rates of creation were obtained in some cases of platinum group metals (Ru-44 by FBR, Pd-46 by LWR) and rare earth (Gd-64 by LWR, Dy-66 by FBR). Therefore, systems based on LWR and FBR have their own advantages depending on target elements. Furthermore, it was found that creation rates of even Z' (= Z + 1) elements from odd Z ones were higher than the opposite cases. This creation rate of an element was interpreted in terms of "average 1-group neutron capture cross section of the corresponding target element <sigma(cz)>'' defined in this work. General trends of the creation rate of an even (odd) Z' element from the corresponding odd (even) Z one were found to be proportional to the 0.78th (0.63th) power of <sigma(cz)>, however with noticeable dispersion. The difference in the powers in the above analysis was explained by the difference in the number of stable isotopes caused by the even-odd effect of Z.

Application of uranium-base hydrogen storage materials can be expected to alleviate the risk, as well as to reduce the cost incurred by globally-stored large amounts of depleted uranium left after uranium enrichment. Various uranium alloys have been examined in terms of hydrogen absorption-desorption properties, among which UNiAl intermetallic compound showed promising characteristics, such as lower absorption-desorption temperatures and better anti-powdering strength. First principle calculation has been carried out on UNiAl hydride to predict the change of crystal structure and the lattice constant with increasing hydrogen content, which showed this calculation to be promising in predicting candidates for good hydrogen absorbers.

Sorption percentage of U(VI) in the absence and in the presence of different acetate concentrations was determined by batch sorption procedures. Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was used to elucidate the mechanisms of uranyl sorption on silica in the presence of acetate, by investigating, in-situ, the changes in the U(VI) sorption on silica surface in presence of ligand: the absorption bands of carboxylate v(COO) in the range 1300-1700 cm(-1) and those around 850-950 cm(-1) of uranyl species v(as)(UO2) are followed. The decrease of U(VI) sorption with increasing acetate concentration was observed. Sorption of U(VI)-acetate (U-Ac) species on silica surface was demonstrated for the first time. ATR-FTIR investigations clearly evidenced the absorption bands characteristic of sorbed U-Ac complexes both from the acetate and uranyl spectral regions those the wavenumbers correspond to sorbed species. No sequence effect of acetate and uranyl on the sorption on silica in ternary systems U(VI)-acetate-silica was observed from the sorption data. From the ATR-FTIR investigations, we can induce that the sorption of U-Ac leads to chemical equilibria and makes possible the modeling of sorption isotherms by surface complexation models. The related thermodynamic constants were modeled using CCM surface complexation modeling.

It is required to take measures to prevent severe accidents and mitigate their radiological consequences. The Regulatory Standard and Research Department, Secretariat of Nuclear Regulation Authority (S/NRA/R) has been conducting numerical studies and experimental studies on relevant severe accident phenomena and countermeasures. This article highlights fission product (FP) release and hydrogen risk as two major areas. Relevant activities in the S/NRA/R are briefly introduced, as follows: 1. For FP release: Identifying the source terms and leak mechanisms is a key issue from the viewpoint of understanding the progression of accident phenomena and planning effective countermeasures that take into account vulnerabilities of containment under severe accident conditions. To resolve these issues, the activities focus on wet well venting, pool scrubbing, iodine chemistry (in-vessel and ex-vessel), containment failure mode, and treatment of radioactive liquid effluent. 2. For hydrogen risk: because of three incidents of hydrogen explosion in reactor buildings, a comprehensive reinforcement of the hydrogen risk management has been a high priority topic. Therefore, the activities in evaluation methods focus on hydrogen generation, hydrogen distribution, and hydrogen combustion.

J	Gupta, S				Gupta, Sanjeev			EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS RELEVANT FOR HYDROGEN AND FISSION PRODUCT ISSUES RAISED BY THE FUKUSHIMA ACCIDENT	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Computational fluid dynamics and lumped-parameter codes; Fission products; Hydrogen; Large-scale experiments; Passive autocatalytic recombiners; Severe accident; THAI test facility	NUCLEAR-POWER-PLANT	The accident at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in March 2011, caused by an earthquake and a subsequent tsunami, resulted in a failure of the power systems that are needed to cool the reactors at the plant. The accident progression in the absence of heat removal systems caused Units 1-3 to undergo fuel melting. Containment pressurization and hydrogen explosions ultimately resulted in the escape of radioactivity from reactor containments into the atmosphere and ocean. Problems in containment venting operation, leakage from primary containment boundary to the reactor building, improper functioning of standby gas treatment system (SGTS), unmitigated hydrogen accumulation in the reactor building were identified as some of the reasons those added-up in the severity of the accident. The Fukushima accident not only initiated worldwide demand for installation of adequate control and mitigation measures to minimize the potential source term to the environment but also advocated assessment of the existing mitigation systems performance behavior under a wide range of postulated accident scenarios. The uncertainty in estimating the released fraction of the radionuclides due to the Fukushima accident also underlined the need for comprehensive understanding of fission product behavior as a function of the thermal hydraulic conditions and the type of gaseous, aqueous, and solid materials available for interaction, e.g., gas components, decontamination paint, aerosols, and water pools. In the light of the Fukushima accident, additional experimental needs identified for hydrogen and fission product issues need to be investigated in an integrated and optimized way. Additionally, as more and more passive safety systems, such as passive autocatalytic recombiners and filtered containment venting systems are being retrofitted in current reactors and also planned for future reactors, identified hydrogen and fission product issues will need to be coupled with the operation of passive safety systems in phenomena oriented and coupled effects experiments. In the present paper, potential hydrogen and fission product issues raised by the Fukushima accident are discussed. The discussion focuses on hydrogen and fission product behavior inside nuclear power plant containments under severe accident conditions. The relevant experimental investigations conducted in the technical scale containment THAI (thermal hydraulics, hydrogen, aerosols, and iodine) test facility (9.2 m high, 3.2 m in diameter, and 60 m(3) volume) are discussed in the light of the Fukushima accident.

J	Lee, YK; Kim, MH				Lee, Yong Kyo; Kim, Myung Hyun			RECYCLING OPTION SEARCH FOR A 600-MWE SODIUM-COOLED TRANSMUTATION FAST REACTOR	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Cooling time; Pyroprocessing; Recovery factor; Recycle scenario; Sodium-cooled fast reactor; Spent fuel		Four recycling scenarios involving pyroprocessing of spent fuel (SF) have been investigated for a 600-MWe transmutation sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR), KALIMER. Performance evaluation was done with code system REBUS connected with TRANSX and TWODANT. Scenario Number 1 is the pyroprocessing of Canada deuterium uranium (CANDU) SF. Because the recycling of CANDU SF does not have any safety problems, the CANDU-Pyro-SFR system will be possible if the pyroprocessing capacity is large enough. Scenario Number 2 is a feasibility test of feed SF from a pressurized water reactor PWR. The sensitivity of cooling time before prior to pyro-processing was studied. As the cooling time increases, excess reactivity at the beginning of the equilibrium cycle (BOEC) decreases, thereby creating advantageous reactivity control and improving the transmutation performance of minor actinides. Scenario Number 3 is a case study for various levels of recovery factors of transuranic isotopes (TRUs). If long-lived fission products can be separated during pyroprocessing, the waste that is not recovered is classified as low- and intermediate-level waste, and it is sufficient to be disposed of in an underground site due to very low-heat-generation rate when the waste cooling time becomes >300 years at a TRU recovery factor of 99.9%. Scenario Number 4 is a case study for the recovery factor of rare earth (RE) isotopes. The RE isotope recovery factor should be lowered to <= 20% in order to make sodium void reactivity less than <7$, which is the design limit of a metal fuel.

Recently, researchers have planned different incineration scenarios for the highly radiotoxic elements of nuclear waste in critical reactors. Computational methods are widely used to predict burnup rates of such nuclear wastes that are used under fuel matrixes in critical reactors. Methods: In this work, the Monte Carlo N-particle transport code was used to calculate the neutronic behavior of a transuranic (TRU)-bearing CANada Deuterium Uranium 6 reactor. Results: The computational data showed that the 1.0% TRU-containing thorium-based fuel matrix presents higher proliferation resistance and TRU depletion rate than the other investigated fuel Matrixes. The fuel matrix includes higher negative temperature reactivity coefficients as well. Conclusion: The investigated thorium-based fuel matrix can be successfully used to decrease the production of highly radiotoxic isotopes.

Under such conditions air ingress may led to hydrogen explosion which could damage the integrity of ITER device and would cause the radioactivity releasing to the environment. Computational fluid dynamics method is proposed to study the distributions of the hydrogen, steam and air in the ITER devices and evaluate hydrogen risk control with inert gas injection and hydrogen removal with passive autocatalytic recombination. To verify the computational models to study hydrogen risk induced by wet bypass accident, STARDUST experiment is modeled and simulated, in which the calculated results compared with the experimental results show that RNG k-epsilon turbulence model can be used in the hydrogen distribution analysis. The calculated results of the hydrogen distribution show that there is hydrogen combustion or explosion risk under the accident conditions. Then the hydrogen mitigation measures is applied to the system, and the analytical result shows that inert gas injection at the early stage of the accident with a large rate could mitigate the hydrogen risk effectively, and that hydrogen recombiners play an important role to mitigate the hydrogen risk in suppression tank, which is helpful for the safety design.

HCPB blanket is a cellular design with solid breeder units (BUs) and other structural components to achieve its functional requirements. BU of the HCPB blanket consists of lithium ceramic breeders and beryllium pebble beds separated by cooling plates (CPs). Thermal-hydraulic analyses using ANSYS CFX have been done to measure the thermal performance of the designed BUs. The temperature distribution in structural and functional materials is obtained and cooling optimization is proposed according to the computational results. Results of BU cooling optimization indicate that the bed temperature is high enough to realize a good tritium release and extraction environment meanwhile maximum temperatures of different materials meet their thermal limits well. Details of BU thermal hydraulic analysis and cooling optimization are presented in this paper.

Tritium environmental safety for CFETR is an important issue and must be evaluated because of the huge amounts of tritium cycling in reactor. In this work, different tritium release scenarios of CFETR and dose limit regulations in China are introduced. And the public dose is preliminarily analyzed under normal and accidental events. Furthermore, after finishing the sensitivity analysis of key input parameters, the public dose is reevaluated based on extreme parameters. Finally, tritium release amount is recalculated consistently with the dose limit in Chinese regulation for CFETR, which would provide a reference for tritium system design of CFETR.

The mission of CFETR is to address the essential R&D issues for achieving practical fusion energy. Its blanket is required to be tritium self-sufficient. In this paper, a helium cooled solid breeder blanket adopting multilayer U-shaped pebble beds was designed and analyzed. Thermo-mechanical analysis of the first wall and side wall combined with breeder unit was carried out for normal operating steady state conditions. The results showed that the maximum temperatures of the structural material, neutron multiplier and tritium breeder pebble beds are 523 degrees C, 558 degrees C and 787 degrees C, respectively, which are below the corresponding limits of 550 degrees C, 650 degrees C and 920 degrees C. The maximum equivalent stress of the structure is under the allowable value with a margin about 14.5%. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Application of Neutron Transport Green's Functions to Threat Scenario Simulation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Interdiction; nuclear material; photon transport; radiation portal monitor; smuggle	DETECTORS	Radiation detectors provide deterrence and defense against nuclear smuggling attempts by scanning vehicles, ships, and pedestrians for radioactive material. Understanding detector performance is crucial to developing novel technologies, architectures, and alarm algorithms. Detection can be modeled through radiation transport simulations; however, modeling a spanning set of threat scenarios over the full transport phase-space is computationally challenging. Previous research has demonstrated Green's functions can simulate photon detector signals by decomposing the scenario space into independently simulated submodels. This paper presents decomposition methods for neutron and time-dependent transport. As a result, neutron detector signals produced from full forward transport simulations can be efficiently reconstructed by sequential application of submodel response functions.

Neutron Spectrometry for UF6 Enrichment Verification in Storage Cylinders	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						30-B cylinders; Geant4 simulation; MCNP5 simulation; neutron spectrometry; nondestructive assay; principal component analysis; UF6; uranium enrichment	SPECTRA; YIELDS	Verification of declared UF6 enrichment and mass in storage cylinders is of great interest in nuclear material nonproliferation. Nondestructive assay (NDA) techniques are commonly used for safeguards inspections to ensure accountancy of declared nuclear materials. Common NDA techniques used include gamma-ray spectrometry and both passive and active neutron measurements. In the present study, neutron spectrometry was investigated for verification of UF6 enrichment in 30B storage cylinders based on an unattended and passive measurement approach. MCNP5 and Geant4 simulated neutron spectra, for selected UF6 enrichments and filling profiles, were used in the investigation. The simulated neutron spectra were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA technique is a well-established technique and has a wide area of application including feature analysis, outlier detection, and gamma-ray spectral analysis. Results obtained demonstrate that neutron spectrometry supported by spectral feature analysis has potential for assaying UF6 enrichment in storage cylinders. Results from the present study also showed that difficulties associated with the UF6 filling profile and observed in other unattended passive neutron measurements can possibly be overcome using the approach presented.

A Rotating Scatter Mask for Inexpensive Gamma-Ray Imaging in Orphan Source Search: Simulation Results	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Compton scattering; defense applications; detector technology; imaging; MCNP	RADIATION DETECTORS; SLAT COLLIMATOR; POINT SOURCES; LARGE-AREA; IMAGER; OPTIMIZATION; TOMOGRAPHY; PROTOTYPE; EMISSION; SOFTWARE	The Rotating Scatter Mask (RSM) system is an inexpensive retrofit that provides imaging capabilities to scintillating detectors. Unlike traditional collimator systems that primarily absorb photons in order to form an image, this system primarily scatters the photons. Over a single rotation, there is a unique, smooth response curve for each defined source position. Testing was conducted using MCNPX simulations. Image reconstruction was performed using a chi-squared reconstruction technique. A simulated 100 uCi, Cs-137 source at 10 meters was detected after a single, 50-second rotation when a uniform terrestrial background was present. A Cs-137 extended source was also tested. The RSM field-of-view is 360 degrees azimuthally as well as 54 degrees above and 54 degrees below the horizontal plane. Since the RSM is built from polyethylene, the overall cost and weight of the system is low. The system was designed to search for lost or stolen radioactive material, also known as the orphan source problem.

Monolithic Multi-Element HPGe Detector Equipped With CMOS Preamplifiers: Construction and Characterization of a Demonstrator	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Semiconductor radiation detectors; X-ray detectors	CHARGE AMPLIFIERS	Multi-element germanium detectors for X-ray fluorescence are widely used in synchrotron experiments and in particular in XAFS experiments. This paper presents the construction and characterization of a demonstrator built to investigate the viability of multi-element monolithic germanium detectors equipped with CMOS front-end electronics. Semikon Detector GmbH fabricated a germanium sensor segmented with a pad pattern with pad size 1 x 1 mm(2). 16 channels were instrumented with the CUBE preamplifiers developed at XGLab Srl. The detector was tested with radioactive sources and with the synchrotron X-ray beam of Diamond. The results showed spectra with energy resolution satisfactory for XAFS experiments but with a considerable tail. The low energy tail was proved to be due to charge sharing. In addition the spectra showed the peak stability as a function of counting rate better than 1% for rate up to 838 kcps. The non-linearity of the peak position vs. energy was estimated to be a maximum of 0.13% No evidence of charge loss in the crystal was identified. This work proved that this technology is a viable option to improve the throughput of germanium fluorescence detectors as long as methods to reduce events leading to charge sharing are in place.

Maximum values for I-131 were 5.6 mBq m(-3) in aerosol form and 13 mBq m(-3) in gaseous form. The maximum values for Cs-134 and Cs-137 were 0.64 and 0.72 mBq m(-3), respectively. The estimated effective half-time for removing the activity from the atmosphere was 6-7 d and 3.5 d for caesium and iodine, respectively. The gaseous-to-total activity ratios of I-131 ranged between 0.3 and 0.9, with an arithmetic mean value of 0.77. The mean value for the Cs-134/Cs-137 ratios was close to 1.0. The effective inhalation dose due to the accident for an adult living in the Czech Republic was estimated at < 4 x 10(-5) mSv, out of which the proportion of I-131 was 88 %.

To address the public concerns, samples of commonly consumed salmon and groundfish harvested from the Canadian west coast in 2013 were analysed for radioactive caesium. None of the fish samples analysed in this study contained any detectable levels of Cs-134 and Cs-137 under given experimental setting with the average detection limit of similar to 2 Bq kg(-1). Using a conservative worst-case scenario where all fish samples would contain Cs-137 exactly at the detection limit level and Cs-134 at half of the detection limit level (to account for much shorter half-life of Cs-134), the resulting radiation dose for people from consumption of this fish would be a very small fraction of the annual dose from exposure to natural background radiation in Canada. Therefore, fish, such as salmon and groundfish, from the Canadian west coast are of no radiological health concern.

Study of the radioactivity induced in air by a 15-MeV proton beam	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								Radioactivity induced by a 15-MeV proton beam extracted into air was studied at the beam transport line of the 18-MeV cyclotron at the Bern University Hospital (Inselspital). The produced radioactivity was calculated and measured by means of proportional counters located at the main exhaust of the laboratory. These devices were designed for precise assessment of air contamination for radiation protection purposes. The main produced isotopes were C-11, N-13 and O-14. Both measurements and calculations correspond to two different irradiation conditions. In the former, protons were allowed to travel for their full range in air. In the latter, they were stopped at the distance of 1.5 m by a beam dump. Radioactivity was measured continuously in the exhausted air starting from 2 min after the end of irradiation. For this reason, the short-lived O-14 isotope gave a negligible contribution to the measured activity. Good agreement was found between the measurements and the calculations within the estimated uncertainties. Currents in the range of 120-370 nA were extracted in air for 10-30 s producing activities of 9-22 MBq of C-11 and N-13. The total activities for C-11 and N-13 per beam current and irradiation time for the former and the latter irradiation conditions were measured to be (3.60 +/- 0.48) x 10(-3) MBq (nA s)(-1) and (2.89 +/- 0.37) x 10(-3) MBq (nA s)(-1), respectively.

Radiological exposure assessment from soil, underground and surface water in communities along the coast of a shallow water offshore oilfield in Ghana	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; GOLD MINE; SAMPLES; RA-226; SPECTROMETRY	Radiometric determinations have been carried out to assess public exposure to radioactivity for communities along the coast of a shallow water offshore oilfield in Ghana (which started their operations recently) in order to establish baseline data using alpha spectrometry after radiochemical separation and non-destructive gamma spectrometry. The average activity concentrations of U-234, U-238, Th-230 and Th-232 by alpha-particle spectrometry and of Ra-226, Ra-228, Th-228, K-40, Pb-210, Th-234 and Cs-137 by gamma-ray spectrometry were determined in the soil samples. The activity concentrations of U-234, U-238, Th-230 and Th-232 were determined in the water samples by alpha-particle spectrometry and of Ra-226 by liquid scintillation counting. The total annual effective dose to the public was estimated from the measured activity concentrations and this was clearly below the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) reference level of 1 mSv y(-1) for public exposure control. In addition, the estimated values of Ra-eq, H-ex and H-in were all lower than the recommended acceptable values and the mean values of gross alpha and gross beta determinations performed for all the water samples give values that were all below the Ghana Standards Authority and World Health Organization recommended guideline values for drinking water quality. The results obtained show insignificant public exposure to radioactivity. However, this study provides important information for future studies on subsequent evaluations of the possible future environmental contamination due to activities of the oil industry in Ghana.

COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; PULSE PILEUP; FEASIBILITY; RESOLUTION	The variation among energy thresholds in a multibin detector for photon-counting spectral CT can lead to ring artefacts in the reconstructed images. Calibration of the energy thresholds can be used to achieve homogeneous threshold settings or to develop compensation methods to reduce the artefacts. We have developed an energy-calibrationmethod for the different comparator thresholds employed in a photon-counting silicon-strip detector. In our case, this corresponds to specifying the linear relation between the threshold positions in units of mV and the actual deposited photon energies in units of keV. This relation is determined by gain and offset values that differ for different detector channels due to variations in the manufacturing process. Typically, the calibration is accomplished by correlating the peak positions of obtained pulse-height spectra to known photon energies, e. g. with the aid of mono-energetic x rays from synchrotron radiation, radioactive isotopes or fluorescence materials. Instead of mono-energetic x rays, the calibrationmethod presented in this papermakes use of a broad x-ray spectrum provided by commercial x-ray tubes. Gain and offset as the calibration parameters are obtained by a regression analysis that adjusts a simulated spectrum of deposited energies to ameasured pulse-height spectrum. Besides the basic photon interactions such as Rayleigh scattering, Compton scattering and photo-electric absorption, the simulation takes into account the effect of pulse pileup, charge sharing and the electronic noise of the detector channels. We verify the method for different detector channels with the aid of a table-top setup, where we find the uncertainty of the keV-value of a calibrated threshold to be between 0.1 and 0.2 keV.

FIELD-OF-VIEW; PERFORMANCE; TOMOGRAPH; SCANNER; BRAIN	For small animal positron emission tomography (PET) research using high radioactivity, such as dynamic studies, the resulting high random coincidence rate of the system degrades image quality. The random coincidence rate is increased not only by the gamma photons from inside the axial-field-of-view (axial-FOV) of the PET system but also by those from outside the axial-FOV. For brain imaging in small animal studies, significant interference is observed from gamma photons emitted from the body. Single gamma photons from the body enter the axial-FOV and increase the random and scatter coincidences. Shielding against the gamma photons from outside the axial-FOV would improve the image quality. For this purpose, we developed a body shield for a small animal PET system, the microPET Primate 4-ring system, and evaluated its performance. The body shield is made of 9-mm-thick lead and it surrounds most of a rat's body. We evaluated the effectiveness of the body shield using a head phantom and a body phantom with a radioactivity concentration ratio of 1: 2 and a maximum total activity of approximately 250 MBq. The random coincidence rate was dramatically decreased to 1/10, and the noise equivalent count rate (NECR) was increased 6 times with an activity of 7 MBq in the head phantom. The true count rate was increased to 35% due to the decrease in system deadtime. The average scatter fraction was decreased to 1/2.5 with the body shield. Count rate measurements of rat were also conducted with an injection activity of approximately 25 MBq of [ C-11] N, N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4cyanophenylthio) benzylamine ([C-11] DASB) and approximately 70 and 310 MBq of 2-deoxy-2-(F-18) fluoro-D-glucose ([F-18] FDG). Using the body shield, [F-18] FDG images of rats were improved by increasing the amount of radioactivity injected.

This research examined if the major damage was infl icted by alpha particles emitted from these atoms or by direct gamma and beta emissions from the inserted wires. We also examined the effi cacy of this treatment against colon cancer in combination with chemotherapy. Materials and methods: Mouse colon carcinomas (CT-26 xenografts), treated by intra-tumoral radioactive wires loaded with Ra-224 atoms were monitored for eff ects on tumor growth, intratumoral tissue damage and distribution of alpha emitting atoms. The eff ects were compared with those of Ra-224-loaded wires coated with poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA), which blocks atom recoil. Similar experiments were performed with radioactive wires combined with systemic 5-FU. Results: Ra-224-loaded wires inhibited tumor growth and formed necrotic areas inside the tumor. PMMA coated wires did not inhibit tumor growth, and caused minor intratumoral damage. Autoradiography images of tumors treated with Ra-224-loaded wires revealed a spread of alpha emitters over several mm, whereas PMMA-coated wires showed no such spread. Injection of 5-FU with Ra-224-loaded wires augmented tumor growth retardation and cure. Conclusions: Ra-224-loaded wires ablate solid tumors by the release of alpha-particle emitting atoms inside the tissue, an eff ect that can be enhanced by combining this method with chemotherapy.

J	Lukosi, E; Prelas, M				Lukosi, Eric; Prelas, Mark			Diamond sensor arrays for neutron detection: Preamplifier signal dependence on sensor array configuration	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article						Diamond detectors; Neutron detection; Spectroscopy; Signal summing; Series array; Parallel array; Detection efficiency	CVD DIAMOND; SINGLE	Experimental verification of simulated results of series and parallel diamond detector arrays is reported. Eight commercially available electronic grade single crystal CVD diamond plates were used in series and parallel array configurations and were characterized through alpha particle and neutron exposures. It was found that a series array of diamond detectors is inherently limited due to the impedances of the diamond plates. Plutonium-beryllium neutron exposures were conducted with each of these diamond plates and on a parallel array of all eight diamond plates. It was found that the detection efficiency scaled linearly with the number of plates and that the pulse height from the preamplifier was not affected by the parallel array configuration. However, the additional capacitance introduced to the charge sensitive preamplifier indicates that there is a limitation to the total size that can be realized with a parallel diamond sensor array before significant signal degradation occurs.
