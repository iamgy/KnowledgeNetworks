In this study, the prediction method was extended to calculate the water level in a spent fuel pit during loss of all AC power supplies, and predicted results were compared with measured values of spent fuel pools in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station. The calculations gave reasonable results, but overestimated the decreasing rate of the water level and the water temperature. This indicated that decay heat was overestimated and evaporation heat transfer from the water surface was underestimated. Results of calculations with 80% decay heat and 155% (Unit 4 pool) or 230% (Unit 2 pool) evaporation heat flux were in good agreement with measured values. The data-fitted evaporation heat fluxes agreed rather well with the evaporation heat transfer correlation proposed by Fujii etal.

This MH-MOX powder is utilized to fabricate MOX fuel with UO2 powder for FBR. The MH method is accompanied with transient boiling phenomena such as overflow and flushing. Toward high-speed and high-capacity conversion by MH-method in the future, it is required to avoid overflow and flushing and to understand optimal conditions for design and operation. At the first step for these objectives, basic knowledge of transient boiling phenomena by the MH-method has been acquired with using distilled water. It is observed that generation of singular bubble triggers flushing and distilled water just before flushing is superheated by a temperature 10 degrees C higher than boiling temperature. Based on these results, it is clarified that the occurrence criteria of flushing correlate with absorbed power in the water and released power from the water surface.

The studied NRPs were N-n-butyl (NBP) and N-n-propyl (NProP) derivatives. In both systems, the precipitation yields precisely determined were always higher than those simply calculated from the ratio of uranium concentrations before and after the precipitation. However, the differences between them are in the range of 0.6%-2.6%. If such a difference is practically negligible, the volume reduction through the precipitation does not have to be taken into account for simplicity of the analytical manipulation.

Radioactivity level and toxic elemental concentration in groundwater at Dei-Dei and Kubwa areas of Abuja, north-central Nigeria	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Abuja boreboles; ICP-MS; Radionuclides; Annual effective dose; Cancer risks	DRINKING-WATER; CHEMICAL TOXICITY; NATURAL URANIUM; RISK-ASSESSMENT; CADMIUM; COPPER; SOILS; BOREHOLE; PROVINCE; KIDNEY	The activity concentrations of uranium and toxic elements in Dei-Dei borehole, Kubwa borehole, Water Board and hand-dug well water samples in Abuja area were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) system. The results obtained were used to calculate human radiological risk over lifetime consumption by the inhabitants in the area. The activity concentrations of U-238 in all the water supplies for drinking ranges from 0.849 mBq L-1 to 2.699 mBq L-1 with the highest value of 2.699 mBq L-1 noted at Dei-Dei borehole whereas the lowest value of 0.849 mBq L-1 was noted in Kubwa borehole. The highest annual effective dose from natural U-238 in all the water samples was found in Dei-Dei borehole with a value of 8.9 x 10(-5) mSv y(-1) whereas the lowest value was noted in Kubwa borehole with a value of 2.8 x 10(-5) mSv y(-1). The radiological risks for cancer mortality were found distinctly low, with the highest value of 1.01 x 10(-7) reported at Del-Del borehole compared to Kubwa borehole with a value of 3.01 x 10(-8). The cancer morbidity risk was noted higher in Dei-Dei borehole with a value of 1.55 x 10(-7) whereas lower value of 4.88 x 10(-9) was reported in Kubwa borehole. The chemical toxicity risk of U-238 in drinking water over a lifetime consumption has a value of 0.006 mu g kg(-1) day(-1) in Dei-Dei borehole whereas lower value of 0.002 mu g kg(-1) day(-1) was found in Kubwa borehole. Measured lead (Pb) and chromium (Cr) concentrations reported higher in Water Board compared to Dei-Dei and Kubwa borehole samples. Significantly, this study inferred that the U-238 concentrations originate from granitic strata of the tectonic events in the area; thus, there was a trend of diffusion towards north to south and re-deposition towards Dei-Dei area.

Based on the analysis of 31 representative bone-coal samples from 9 boreholes at various depth drilled in planning initial minery, the average activity concentrations of U-238, Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 were determined in the range of 196.4-653.3 Bq/kg, 200.2-564.4 Bq/kg, 9.4-64.6 Bq/kg and 71.5-345.4 Bq/kg, respectively. The major natural radionuclides were identified as U-series nuclides with the activity concentrations obviously higher than common coal. The estimated absorbed dose rates in the air varied between 107.1 and 310.5 nGy/h. The averaged external annual effective dose due to the radioactivity in the bone-coal was predicted as 0.37 mSv/a, and the main contribution is 87.5% for U-series. The radium equivalent activity, the external and internal indices of most of the samples were shown with high values of an unacceptable level, which indicated the bone-coal would carry a considerable radiation hazard to the workers and the local individuals. The hazard of radon inhalation should be focused during mining and following processes. Further radiological assessment should be carried out as the natural radioactivity in the bone-coal would be technically enriched during the combustion process of the bone-coal and utilization of the byproducts.

PUBLIC HEALTH AND MEDICAL PREPAREDNESS FOR A NUCLEAR DETONATION: THE NUCLEAR INCIDENT MEDICAL ENTERPRISE	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements; emergency planning; nuclear war; radiological terrorism	SCARCE RESOURCES; RADIATION VICTIMS; GLOBAL CONSENSUS; DECISION-MODEL; MASS-CASUALTY; MANAGEMENT; EMERGENCIES; ALLOCATION; TRIAGE; TOOLS	Resilience and the ability to mitigate the consequences of a nuclear incident are enhanced by (1) effective planning, preparation and training; (2) ongoing interaction, formal exercises, and evaluation among the sectors involved; (3) effective and timely response and communication; and (4) continuous improvements based on new science, technology, experience, and ideas. Public health and medical planning require a complex, multifaceted systematic approach involving federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments; private sector organizations; academia; industry; international partners; and individual experts and volunteers. The approach developed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Nuclear Incident Medical Enterprise (NIME) is the result of efforts from government and nongovernment experts. It is a "bottom-up" systematic approach built on the available and emerging science that considers physical infrastructure damage, the spectrum of injuries, a scarce resources setting, the need for decision making in the face of a rapidly evolving situation with limited information early on, timely communication, and the need for tools and just-in-time information for responders who will likely be unfamiliar with radiation medicine and uncertain and overwhelmed in the face of the large number of casualties and the presence of radioactivity. The components of NIME can be used to support planning for, response to, and recovery from the effects of a nuclear incident. Recognizing that it is a continuous work-in-progress, the current status of the public health and medical preparedness and response for a nuclear incident is provided.	[Coleman, C.

J	Pryor, KH				Pryor, Kathryn H.			RADIATION SAFETY OF SEALED RADIOACTIVE SOURCES	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements; exposure, radiation; radioactive materials; occupational safety		Sealed radioactive sources are used in a wide variety of occupational settings and under differing regulatory/licensing structures. The definition of a sealed radioactive source varies between U.S. regulatory authorities and standard-setting organizations. Potential problems with sealed sources cover a range of risks and impacts. The loss of control of high activity sealed sources can result in very high or even fatal doses to members of the public who come in contact with them. Sources that are not adequately sealed and that fail can cause spread of contamination and potential intake of radioactive material. There is also the possibility that sealed sources may be (or threaten to be) used for terrorist purposes and disruptive opportunities. Until fairly recently, generally licensed sealed sources and devices received little, if any, regulatory oversight and were often forgotten, lost or unaccounted for. Nonetheless, generally licensed devices can contain fairly significant quantities of radioactive material, and there is some potential for exposure if a device is treated in a way for which it was never designed. Industrial radiographers use and handle high activity and/or high dose-rate sealed sources in the field with a high degree of independence and minimal regulatory oversight. Failure to follow operational procedures and properly handle radiography sources can and has resulted in serious injuries and death. Industrial radiographers have experienced a disproportionately large fraction of incidents that have resulted in unintended exposure to radiation. Sources do not have to contain significant quantities of radioactive material to cause problems in the event of their failure. A loss of integrity can cause the spread of contamination and potential exposure to workers and members of the public. The National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements has previously provided recommendations on select aspects of sealed source programs. Future efforts to provide recommendations for sealed source programs are discussed.

PENNSYLVANIA'S TECHNOLOGICALLY ENHANCED, NATURALLY OCCURRING RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL EXPERIENCES AND STUDIES OF THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements; environmental impact; naturally-occurring radionuclides; radon		This presentation provides an overview of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's experiences and ongoing studies related to technologically enhanced, naturally occurring radioactive material (TENORM) in the oil and gas industry. It has been known for many years that Pennsylvania's geology is unique, with several areas having relatively high levels of natural uranium and thorium. In the 1950s, a few areas of the state were evaluated for commercial uranium production. In the late 1970s, scoping studies of radon in homes prompted the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Bureau of Radiation Protection (BRP) to begin planning for a larger state-wide radon study. The BRP and Oil and Gas Bureau also performed a TENORM study of produced water in the early 1990s for a number of conventional oil and gas wells. More recently, BRP and the Bureau of Solid Waste developed radiation monitoring regulations for all Pennsylvania solid waste disposal facilities. These were implemented in 2001, prompting another evaluation of oil and gas operations and sludge generated from the treatment of conventionally produced water and brine but mainly focused on the disposal of TENORM solid waste in the state's Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Subtitle D landfills. However, since 2008, the increase in volumes of gas well wastewater and levels of Ra-226 observed in the unconventional shale gas well flow-back fracking water has compelled DEP to fully re-examine these oil and gas operations. Specifically, with BRP in the lead, a new TENORM study of oil and gas operations and related wastewater treatment operations has been initiated (PDEP 2013), supported by an American National Standards Institute standard on TENORM (ANSI/HPS 2009) and a U.S. Government Accountability Office report on shale resource development and risks (GAO 2012). This study began in early 2013 and will examine the potential public and worker radiation exposure and environmental impact as well as re-evaluate TENORM waste disposal. This presentation summarizes conventional and unconventional oil and gas well operations, geology and respective uranium/thorium content, radium content in oil and gas wastewater, treatment solids, radon in natural gas, the scope of other TENORM issues in the state, regulatory framework, national regulations and guidance. It also provides an overview of past and the status of ongoing TENORM studies in the Commonwealth (Rowan et al. 2011; Rowan and Kraemer 2012; Schmid 2012).

FRAMEWORK AND NEED FOR DOSIMETRY AND MEASUREMENTS: QUANTITATION MATTERS	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements; dose assessment; dosimetry; radiation protection	UNCERTAINTIES; DEPOSITION; MODEL	It has always been recognized that radiation measurements and dosimetry (M & D) play a crucial role in developing radiation protection programs for workers and members of the public, particularly as they relate to mitigating potential health risks from exposure to radiation. The National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) has always devoted significant resources to these scientific disciplines in terms of its published reports, and it is anticipated that this emphasis will continue. This includes focus on both external and internal radiation exposure as well as radiation and radioactivity measurement methodology. NCRP, as part of its management of scientific activities, has designated Program Area Committee 6 to focus on radiation M & D. This paper briefly describes how radiation M & D has been addressed historically in terms of NCRP activities. It reports how the emphases have changed over the years and how NCRP has worked effectively with other radiation protection organizations, such as the International Commission on Radiological Protection, to leverage its expertise in advancing the science of M & D. Current and prospective activities in M & D by NCRP are also described to frame the future in these areas of interest necessary for the optimum application of radiation protection principles and programs.

The primary outcome of the epidemiologic study is cancer mortality, but other causes of death such as cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease will be evaluated. The success of the study is tied to the validity of the dose reconstruction approaches to provide realistic estimates of organ-specific radiation absorbed doses that are as accurate and precise as possible and to properly evaluate their accompanying uncertainties. The dosimetry aspects for the MWS are challenging in that they address diverse exposure scenarios for diverse occupational groups being studied over a period of up to 70 y. The dosimetric issues differ among the varied exposed populations that are considered: atomic veterans, U.S. Department of Energy workers exposed to both penetrating radiation and intakes of radionuclides, nuclear power plant workers, medical radiation workers, and industrial radiographers. While a major source of radiation exposure to the study population comes from external gamma-or x-ray sources, for some of the study groups, there is a meaningful component of radionuclide intakes that requires internal radiation dosimetry assessments. Scientific Committee 6-9 has been established by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) to produce a report on the comprehensive organ dose assessment (including uncertainty analysis) for the MWS. The NCRP dosimetry report will cover the specifics of practical dose reconstruction for the ongoing epidemiologic studies with uncertainty analysis discussions and will be a specific application of the guidance provided in NCRP Report Nos. 158, 163, 164, and 171. The main role of the Committee is to provide guidelines to the various groups of dosimetrists involved in the MWS to ensure that certain dosimetry criteria are considered: calculation of annual absorbed doses in the organs of interest, separation of low and high linear-energy transfer components, evaluation of uncertainties, and quality assurance and quality control. It is recognized that the MWS and its approaches to dosimetry are a work in progress and that there will be flexibility and changes in direction as new information is obtained with regard to both dosimetry and the epidemiologic features of the study components. This paper focuses on the description of the various components of the MWS, the available dosimetry results, and the challenges that have been encountered. It is expected that the Committee will complete its report in 2016.

The main degradation products, dibutyl phosphate (BDBP) and monobutyl phosphate (H2MBP) were detected by the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and the degradation products that could not be easily removed by the washing procedure were measured by the Pu retention. Effects of the absorbed dose, the HNO3 concentration, and the cumulative dose on the irradiation stability of the systems were investigated. The yields of HDBP, H2MBP and the Pu retention increased with the absorbed dose. The HNO3 concentration affected significantly on the yield of HDBP, but had little impact on the output of H2MBP and Pu retention. For a similar absorbed dose, the Pu retention of the solvent by alpha irradiation is larger than that by gamma irradiation.

Charged particles such as H-ions are accelerated azimuthally within a high intensity electric field (E-field) generated from a radio frequency (RE) system in cyclotron. A high power RE signal is transmitted from an RE amplifier to an RE resonating cavity. The RE system of the SKKUCY-9 operates in continuous wave (CW) mode. If an ion beam were accelerated in the cyclotron, the vacuum level and permittivity would be changed because of beam loading. It causes an impedance shift of the RF resonating cavity. This impedance mismatch generates reflected power that decreases the RF transmitting power. To prevent this situation, an impedance matching system is necessary. This paper describes the impedance matching system of a 20 kW RF amplifier in an SKKUCY-9 compact cyclotron. The impedance matching circuit was designed using both an input stage and output stage, which are divided between the cathode and anode in a vacuum tube that is used as an amplifying device. The equivalent circuit of the matching system is made of passive elements. The characteristic results of designed circuit were calculated using a Smith chart. In assembling, the inductors were replaced by movable stub line structures. The dimensions of the stub line structures were optimized with equations and the measurement results. The experiment was performed to find the result values of matching circuit impedance and RE power amplitude. (C) 2014 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

A water-based neutron detector as a well multiplicity counter	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Water Cherenkov; Neutron detector; Multiplicity well counter; Spontaneous fission; Spent fuel; Gadolinium	DOPED WATER	We report the performance characteristics of a water based neutron detecting multiplicity counter for the non-destructive assay of fissile sources. This technique could replace or supplement existing He-3-based multiplicity counters. The counter is a 1.02 m(3) Lank containing pure deionized water doped with 0.5% GdCl3 It has highly reflective walls and eight 10-in. PMTs mounted at the top. An unshielded source well of 19 cm diameter, mounted at the top and center, extends 73 cm down into the detector. The counter was evaluated using low intensity Cf-252 and 6 Co sources, and a fast pulsing LED to simulate higher intensity backgrounds. At low gamma ray intensities (similar to 200 kBq or less) we report an absolute neutron detection efficiency of 28% and a 6 C0 rejection/suppression factor of similar to 10(8) to 1. For sources with high gamma ray intensities, the neutron efficiency was 22% + 1% up to a GuCo equivalent activity of 4 MBq. The detector background event rate, primarily due to muons and other cosmogenic particles, was found to be stable over a period of almost three months. The minimum detectable neutron source intensity above background was 3.1 n/s, assuming a one-hour data acquisition. 2014 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.	[Dazeley, S.; Bernstein, A.; Bowden, N.

The indigenously developed prototype system presented in this paper is capable of detecting the reinforcement of varied diameters embedded in the concrete and as well as up to 60 mm depth, with the aid of Caesium-137(Cs-137) radioactive source and a high resolution HPGe detector. The technique could also detect the inhomogeneities present in the test specimen by interpreting the material density variation caused due to the count rate. The experimental results are correlated using established techniques such as radiography and rebar locators. The results obtained from its application to locate the rebars are quite promising and also been successfully used for reinforcement mapping.

New data are presented for Nb-89m,Nb-89g, Nb90(m+g), Nb-91m, Nb-92m, Nb-95m,Nb-95g, Nb-96, Zr-86, Zr87(m+g), Zr-88, Zr89(0.94m+g), Zr-95, Y-85m,Y-85g, Y-86m,Y-86(0.99m+g), Y-87m,Y-87(0.984m+g), Y-88, Y-90m, Y-91m and Sr85(0.87m+g). The experimental results are compared with the available literature data as well as the evaluated theoretical predictions by means of the TALYS code, up to 70 MeV, as compiled in the TENDL-2013 library. For a number of short-lived radionuclides, i.e., Y-85m, Y-85g, Y-86m, Y-90m, Y-91m and Zr87(m+g), the present experimental cross sections are likely the first to be reported for their formation in Zr-nat + p.

J	Heidary, S; Setayeshi, S				Heidary, Saeed; Setayeshi, Saeed			Using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system technique for crosstalk correction in simultaneous Tc-99m/Tl-201 SPECT imaging: A Monte Carlo simulation study	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Monte Carlo; Dual-isotope; ANFIS; OSEM	ATTENUATION CORRECTION; BRAIN SPECT; SCATTER; COMPENSATION; NETWORKS; TL-201; ANFIS; GATE	This work presents a simulation based study by Monte Carlo which uses two adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) for cross talk compensation of simultaneous Tc-99m/Tl-201 dual-radioisotope SPECT imaging. We have compared two neuro-fuzzy systems based on fuzzy c-means (FCM) and subtractive (SUB) clustering. Our approach incorporates eight energy-windows image acquisition from 28 keV to 156 keV and two main photo peaks of Tl-201 (77 +/- 10% keV) and Tc-99m (140 +/- 10% keV). The Geant4 application in emission tomography (GATE) is used as a Monte Carlo simulator for three cylindrical and a NURBS Based Cardiac Torso (NCAT) phantom study. Three separate acquisitions including two single-isotopes and one dual isotope were performed in this study. Cross talk and scatter corrected projections are reconstructed by an iterative ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm which models the non-uniform attenuation in the projection/back-projection. ANFIS-FCM/SUB structures are tuned to create three to sixteen fuzzy rules for modeling the photon cross-talk of the two radioisotopes. Applying seven to nine fuzzy rules leads to a total improvement of the contrast and the bias comparatively. It is found an outperformance for the ANFIS-FCM due to its acceleration and mostly accurate results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This first ever cryogenically operated stopping cell serves as prototype device for the Low-Energy Branch of the Super-FRS at FAIR. The cell has a stopping volume that is 1 m long and 25 cm in diameter. Ions are guided by a DC field along the length of the stopping cell and by a combined RF and DC fields provided by an RE carpet at the exit-hole side. The ultra-high purity of the stopping gas required for optimum ion survival is reached by cryogenic operation. The design considerations and construction of the cryogenic stopping cell, as well as some performance characteristics, are described in detail. Special attention is given to the cryogenic aspects in the design and construction of the stopping cell and the cryocooler-based cooling system. The cooling system allows the operation of the stopping cell at any desired temperature between about 70 K and room temperature. The cooling system performance in realistic on-line conditions at the FRS Ion Catcher Facility at GSI is discussed. A temperature of 110 K at which efficient ion survival was observed is obtained after 10 h of cooling. A minimum temperature of the stopping gas of 72 K was reached. The expertise gained from the design, construction and performance of the prototype cryogenic stopping cell has allowed the development of a Final version for the Low Energy Branch of the Super FRS to proceed.

The observation of the Coulomb excitation at different ion velocities can be performed with high resolution gamma-ray detectors in one single experiment by using two targets mounted at a few centimeters distance along the beam axis. Excitation in either of the targets is distinguished by different observed Doppler-shifts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we show the optical characteristics of pure poly (vinyltoluene) (PVT). It has a 285-nm excitation maximum and a 315-nm emission maximum. The effective refractive index is 1.66, which was derived from its emission spectrum. Light yields were determined by irradiation with Cs-137 and Bi-207 radioactive sources. The light attenuation length is an unexpectedly high 40.5 +/- 0.3 mm. These results indicate that thick samples of uncloped PVT can be used as effective scintillation materials, and will stimulate future applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Such databases contain uniquely defined and recommended data-sets that are intended for adoption with confidence in both energy and non-energy fields of application. Example evaluations are given to demonstrate the form of methodology adopted in such work, along with the emergence of powerful software techniques to display the recommended decay data in user-friendly forms. Decay-data requirements in both nuclear power generation and nuclear medicine are also assessed - inadequacies in the existing decay data of specific radionuclides have been identified, and are reviewed in order to define the need for further studies.

Four independent committees were established by the Japanese government, the Diet of Japan, the Rebuild Japan Initiative Foundation, and TEPCO to investigate the accident and published their respective reports. Also, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency carried out an analysis of accident causes to obtain the lessons learned from the accident and made its report public. This article reviews the reports and clarifies the differences in their positions, from the technological point of view, focusing on the accident progression and causes. Moreover, the undiscussed issues are identified to provide insights useful for the near-term regulatory activities including accident investigation by the Nuclear Regulation Authority.

However, the ceramic crucible used in the electrowinning process poses an issue during pyroprocessing. The crucible is chemically unstable and prone to thermal fatigue. In this study, the thermodynamic simulation software HSC (enthalpy, entropy and heat capacity) Chemistry was employed to evaluate the chemical stabilities of different ceramic crucibles containing liquid cadmium as well as liquid bismuth cathodes, which also contained rare earth elements and lithium. The chemical stabilities were experimentally validated by measuring the contact angles between the liquid cathode (LC) materials and four ceramic materials (Al2O3, MgO, Y2O3, and BeO) in situ. The infiltration depths of the liquid bismuth cathode elements were measured using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. To determine the Weibull distributions of the investigated ceramics, thermal fatigue tests were performed using plates of the ceramics.

NaI(Tl) Detector Efficiency Computation Using Radioactive Parallelepiped Sources Based on Efficiency Transfer Principle	SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF NUCLEAR INSTALLATIONS			English	Article							ENERGY PEAK EFFICIENCY; GAMMA-RAY SPECTROMETRY; SCINTILLATION DETECTORS; CALCULATE; FORMULA; SAMPLES	The efficiency transfer (ET) principle is considered as a simple numerical simulation method, which can be used to calculate the full-energy peak efficiency (FEPE) of 3(n) x 3(n) NaI(Tl) scintillation detector over a wide energy range. In this work, the calculations of FEPE are based on computing the effective solid angle ratio between a radioactive point and parallelepiped sources located at various distances from the detector surface. Besides, the attenuation of the photon by the source-to-detector system (detector material, detector end cap, and holder material) was considered and determined. This method is straightforwardly useful in setting up the efficiency calibration curve for NaI(Tl) scintillation detector, when no calibration sources exist in volume shape. The values of the efficiency calculations using theoretical method are compared with the measured ones and the results show that the discrepancies in general for all the measurements are found to be less than 6%.

J	Shim, HJ; Jang, SH; Kang, SM				Shim, Hyung Jin; Jang, Sang Hoon; Kang, Soo Min			Monte Carlo Alpha Iteration Algorithm for a Subcritical System Analysis	SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF NUCLEAR INSTALLATIONS			English	Article								The alpha-k iteration method which searches the fundamental mode alpha-eigenvalue via iterative updates of the fission source distribution has been successfully used for the Monte Carlo (MC) alpha-static calculations of supercritical systems. However, the alpha-k iteration method for the deep subcritical system analysis suffers from a gigantic number of neutron generations or a huge neutron weight, which leads to an abnormal termination of the MC calculations. In order to stably estimate the prompt neutron decay constant (alpha) of prompt subcritical systems regardless of subcriticality, we propose a new MC alpha-static calculation method named as the alpha iteration algorithm. The new method is derived by directly applying the power method for the alpha-mode eigenvalue equation and its calculation stability is achieved by controlling the number of time source neutrons which are generated in proportion to alpha divided by neutron speed in MC neutron transport simulations. The effectiveness of the alpha iteration algorithm is demonstrated for two-group homogeneous problems with varying the subcriticality by comparisons with analytic solutions. The applicability of the proposed method is evaluated for an experimental benchmark of the thorium-loaded accelerator-driven system.

CANDU Safety R&D Status, Challenges, and Prospects in Canada	SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF NUCLEAR INSTALLATIONS			English	Review								In Canada, safe operation of CANDU (CANada Deuterium Uranium; it is a registered trademark of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited) reactors is supported by a full-scope program of nuclear safety research and development (R&D) in key technical areas. Key nuclear R&D programs, facilities, and expertise are maintained in order to address the unique features of the CANDU as well as generic technology areas common to CANDU and LWR (light water reactor). This paper presents an overview of the CANDU safety R&D which includes background, drivers, current status, challenges, and future directions. This overview of the Canadian nuclear safety R&D programs includes those currently conducted by the COG (CANDU Owners Group), AECL (Atomic Energy of Canada Limited), Candu Energy Inc., and the CNSC (Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission) and by universities via UNENE (University Network of Excellence in Nuclear Engineering) sponsorship. In particular, the nuclear safety R&D program related to the emerging CANDU ageing issues is discussed. The paper concludes by identifying directions for the future nuclear safety R&D.

The innovative assemblies are loaded with high enrichment fresh UO2 and MOX fuels. UO2 fuel enrichment is increased above existing design limitations for LWR fuels (>5%). MOX fuel enrichment with fissile Pu content is established to achieve the same burnup level as that of high enrichment UO2 fuel. For the numerical analysis, the TRITON functional module of SCALE 6.1 code with the 238-group ENDF/BVI cross section data library was applied. The investigation of the void reactivity feedback is performed in the entire 0-100% void fraction range. Higher values of void reactivity coefficient for assembly loaded with MOX fuel are found in comparison with values for assembly loaded with UO2 fuel. Moreover, coefficient values for MOX fuel are positive over 75% void fraction. The variation of the void reactivity coefficient is explained by the results of the decomposition analysis based on four-factor formula and neutron absorption reactions for main isotopes. Additionally, the impact of the moderation enhancement on the void reactivity coefficient was investigated for the innovative assembly with MOX fuel.

This study proposes an improved shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) for the combinatorial optimization problem of ASP. An ASP experiment is conducted to verify the feasibility and stability of the improved SFLA. Simultaneously, the improved SFLA is compared with SFLA, genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and adaptive mutation particle swarm optimization in terms of efficiency and capability of locating the best global assembly sequence. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm exhibits outstanding performance in solving the ASP problem. The application of the proposed algorithm should increase the level of ASP in a radioactive environment.

PHARE was a pre-accession financial assistance programme which involved countries from Central and Eastern Europe that applied to become members of the European Union. The paper presents a synthesis of the projects carried out in Romania for enhancing nuclear safety by consolidating key areas such as Regulatory Activities, Radioactive Waste Management and On-Site assistance, in order to fulfil the requirements for accession to the European Union. Statistical considerations on the impact of the projects are also proposed and an analysis of the methodology of intervention is made.

J	Naser, H				Naeser, Hanns			Paradigm Shift in Transport Legislation or Rather at the ''Bottleneck"	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								In the year just started significant decisions with considerable consequences by the Federal Constitutional Court and the Federal Administrative Court in the field of nuclear law are expected. Especially the decision with regards to nuclear phase-out" within the 13th amendment of the Atomic Energy Act is being eagerly expected, as with its far-reaching consequences also fundamental constitutional questions need to be answered. The Federal Administrative Court will need to decide on the question, whether she admits the appeal against the Brunsbtittel decision by the Higher Administrative Court Schleswig-Holstein (MAC), which from the view of claimant shifted the fundamental basis of demarcation of responsibilities between the executive and judiciary power. In comparison to these fundamental decisions the awaited decision by the MAC on nuclear transport legislation seems of subordinate importance, although she will proceed with a paradigm shift in the legal area. The decision deals with the question as to whether and when a right of action from a third party within the nuclear transport legislation can be accepted or more precisely under which preconditions a third party has clear standing against a nuclear transport authorisation. As the site selection law (issued on 23 July 2013 BGBI I p. 2552) excludes the recirculation of vitrified waste block canisters from reprocessing spent fuel elements to the transport cask storage facility Gorleben, the decision by the MAC Luneburg for this site will only be relevant for present unpredictable transportations from the transport cask storage facility Gorleben to a final repository. If necessary interest to seek a declaratory judgment for declaratory action, in concreto danger of recurrence will be approved, is another matter.

J	Perrotta, JA; Soares, AJ				Perrotta, Jose Augusto; Soares, Adalberto Jose			RMB: The New Brazilian Multipurpose Research Reactor	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article								Brazil has four research reactors (RR) in operation: IEA-R1, a 5 MW pool type RR; IPR-R1, a 100 kW TRIGA type RR; ARGONAUTA, a 500 W Argonaut type RR, and IPEN/MB-01, a 100W critical facility. The first three were constructed in the 50's and 60's, for teaching, training, and nuclear research, and for many years they were the basic infrastructure for the Brazilian nuclear developing program. The last, IPEN/MB-01, is the result of a national project developed specifically for qualification of reactor physics codes. Considering the relative low power of Brazilian research reactors, with exception of [EARL none of the other reactors are feasible for radioisotope production, and even IEA-R1 has a limited capacity. As a consequence, since long ago, 100% of the Mo-99 needed to attend Brazilian nuclear medicine services has been imported. Because of the high dependence on external supply, the international Moly-99 supply crisis that occurred in 2008/2009 affected significantly Brazilian nuclear medicine services, and as presented in previous IAEA events [1], in 2010 Brazilian government formalized the decision to build a new research reactor. The new reactor named RMB (Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor) will be a 30 MW open pool type reactor, using low enriched uranium fuel. The facility will be part of a new nuclear research centre, to be built about 100 kilometres from So Paulo city, in the southern part of Brazil. The new nuclear research centre will have several facilities, to use thermal and cold neutron beams; to produce radioisotopes; to perform neutron activation analysis; and to perform irradiations tests of materials and fuels of interest for the Brazilian nuclear program. An additional facility will be used to store, for at least 100 years, all the fuel used in the reactor. The paper describes the main characteristics of the new centre, emphasising the research reactor and giving a brief description of the laboratories that will be constructed, It also presents the status of the project.

On Some Fundamental Peculiarities of the Traveling Wave Reactor	SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF NUCLEAR INSTALLATIONS			English	Article							BURN-UP WAVES; NUCLEAR; COOLANT; REGIME; CANDLE	On the basis of the condition for nuclear burning wave existence in the neutron-multiplying media (U-Pu and Th-U cycles) we show the possibility of surmounting the so-called dpa-parameter problem and suggest an algorithm of the optimal nuclear burning wave mode adjustment, which is supposed to yield the wave parameters (fluence/neutron flux, width and speed of nuclear burning wave) that satisfy the dpa-condition associated with the tolerable level of the reactor materials radioactive stability, in particular that of the cladding materials. It is shown for the first time that the capture and fission cross sections of U-238 and Pu-239 increase with temperature within 1000-3000K range, which under certain conditions may lead to a global loss of the nuclear burning wave stability. Some variants of the possible stability loss due to the so-called blow-up modes (anomalous nuclear fuel temperature and neutron flow evolution) are discussed and are found to possibly become a reason for a trivial violation of the traveling wave reactor internal safety.

Origins and trend of radionuclides within the lower Rhone River over the last decades	RADIOPROTECTION			English	Article						Rhone river; radionuclides; chronicles; suspended particles; filtered waters	ARTIFICIAL RADIONUCLIDES; MEDITERRANEAN SEA; RADIOACTIVITY; SEDIMENT; FRANCE	Geological and climatic diversity leads to significant spatial variability of naturally occurring radioactivity levels, whether in soils, sediments or natural waters. The activity level of Rhone sediments is estimated at 1450 Bq/kg, between the levels observed in the Loire (1925 Bq/kg) and Seine (730 Bq/kg). The largest amounts of radioactive effluent from nuclear facilities concern tritium, for which activity levels are currently 1000 times higher than the sum of artificial gamma emitters discharged. The proportions of naturally occurring C-14 and H-3 in the lower reaches of the River Rh One are estimated at 50 to 70% and <5%, respectively, with the remaining amount coming from nuclear facilities. Long-term records from River Rhone monitoring show that the level of radioactive contamination from artificial sources declined sharply starting in the early 90s, with the level divided by 10 to 100 depending on the element. Radioactivity of natural origin remained unchanged as expected.

This pilot study required E-perm Electret Ionization Chamber (EIC) exposure in homes and the sampling of soils and foodstuffs representative of the food consumption patterns of the population of Bakassi. The results show high exposure of members of the public to natural radiation. Elevated indoor radon concentrations due to building construction were observed, and high exposure to Po-210 attributable to the dietary habits of the local population, mainly consisting of seafood. Finally, a total dose of 34.6 mSv.y(-1) was found, much higher than the world average value. In the case of confirmation of the results of this study, countermeasures must be taken into consideration to avoid such a high level of exposure, to reduce the radiation dose to the population. Taking into account the limited number of samples, the present work should be considered as a preliminary study.

Sources of such difficulty include uncertainty in data like pregnancy commencing time, amount and distribution of metastasized thyroid cells in body, effect of the thyroidectomy on the fetus dose coefficient etc. Despite all these uncertainties, estimation of the order of the fetus dose in most cases is enough for medical and legal decision-making purposes. A model for adapting the dose coefficients recommended by the well-known methods to the problem of fetus dose assessment in athyrotic patients is proposed. The model defines a correction factor for the problem and ensures that the fetus dose in athyrotic pregnant patients is less than the normal patients. A case of pregnant patient undergone post-surgical therapy by I-131 is then studied for quantitative comparison of the methods. The results draw a range for the fetus dose in athyrotic patients using the derived factor. This reduces the concerns on under- or over-estimation of the embryo/fetus dose and is helpful for personal and/or legal decision-making on abortion.

This fiber-optic temperature sensor was fabricated using an infrared optical fiber to transmit the infrared light emitted from water at a certain temperature. To minimize the decrease in the detection efficiency of the fiber-optic temperature sensor due to vapor generation, its surface was coated by spraying an antifog solution and drying several times. The measurement data of the fiber-optic temperature sensor was almost linear in the range of 30 similar to 70 degrees C. This sensor could be used as an auxiliary temperature monitoring system in a spent nuclear fuel pool.

Assessment of biological effectiveness of boron neutron capture therapy in primary and metastatic melanoma cell lines	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT); Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE); Compound Biological Effectiveness (CBE); borophenylalanine; melanoma	AMINO-ACID TRANSPORTER; HIGH-GRADE GLIOMAS; MALIGNANT-MELANOMA; TARGETED THERAPY; HEAVY-CHAIN; IN-VITRO; RADIATION; TUMORS; BORONOPHENYLALANINE; IDENTIFICATION	Purpose: In order to optimize the effectiveness of Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT), Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE) and Compound Biological Effectiveness (CBE) were determined in two human melanoma cell lines, M8 and Mel-J cells, using the amino acid p-boronophenylalanine (BPA) as boron carrier. Materials and methods: The effects of BNCT on the primary amelanotic cell line M8 and on the metastatic pigmented melanoma cell line Mel-J were studied using colony formation assay. The RBE values were determined using both a gamma ray source, and the neutron beam from the Nuclear Reactor of the National Atomic Energy Commission (RA-3). For the determination of the RBE, cells were irradiated with increasing doses of both sources, between 1 and 8 Gy; and for the determination of CBE factors, the cells were pre-incubated with BPA before irradiation. Afterwards, the cell surviving fraction (SF) was determined for each treatment. Results: Marked differences were observed between both cell lines. Mel-J cells were more radioresistant than the M8 cell line. The clonogenic assays showed that for a SF of 1%, the RBE values were 1.3 for M8 cells and 1.5 for Mel-J cells. Similarly, the CBE values for a 1% SF were 2.1 for M8 and 3 for Mel-J cell lines. For the endpoint of 0.1% of SF the RBE values obtained were 1.2 for M8 and 1.4 for Mel-J cells. Finally, CBE values calculated for a 0.1% were 2 and 2.6 for M8 and Mel-J cell lines respectively. In order to estimate the uptake of the non-radioactive isotope Boron 10 (B-10), a neutron induced autoradiographic technique was performed showing discrepancies in B-10 uptake between both cell lines. Conclusions: These obtained in vitro results are the first effectiveness factors determined for human melanoma at the RA-3 nuclear reactor and show that BNCT dosimetry planning for patients could be successfully performed using these new factors.

The effect of gamma-radiation in Li4SiO4 ceramic breeder blankets	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						Irradiation effect; Electrical impedance spectroscopy; Ionic diffusion; Solid breeder blanket; Orthosilicate ceramic; Gamma-radiation	ELECTRICAL DEGRADATION; LITHIUM ORTHOSILICATE; IONIC-CONDUCTIVITY; TRITIUM RELEASE; REACTOR; CRYSTAL; MODULES; ITER	Lithium orthosilicate (Li4SiO4) is considered one of the best candidates for the solid breeder blanket system (BBs) of future thermonuclear reactors. During reactor operation it will be bombarded by neutrons and gamma radiation which may alter its composition and properties, affecting its shielding role. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is here used as a non-destructive tool for monitoring the electrical bulk conductivity of Li4SiO4 ceramic after different ionizing damaging treatments. The compound fabricated in our laboratories, was irradiated by a Co-60 in the Nayade-facility (CIEMAT-Spain). Several studies with slight experimental variations were realized and here presented to understand the dynamic of the charge carriers' movement and the role of intrinsic and extrinsic defects on the electrical properties of this candidate ceramic.

Isotopically enriched structural materials in nuclear devices	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						Activation; LAM; Enrichment; Shut-down activity; Waste disposal; Gas production	LOW-ACTIVATION; MARTENSITIC STEELS; REACTOR; BLANKETS	A large number of materials exist which have been labeled as low activation structural materials (LAM). Most often, these materials have been designed in order to substitute-out or completely remove elements that become activated and contribute significantly to shut-down activity after being irradiated by neutrons in a reactor environment. To date, one of the fundamental principles from which LAMs have been developed is that natural elemental compositions are the building blocks of LAMs. Thus, elements such as Co, Al, Ni, Mo, Nb, N and Cu that produce long-lived decay products are significantly reduced or removed from the LAM composition. These elements have an important part to play in the composition of steels and the removal/substitution can have a negative impact on materials properties such as yield stress and fracture toughness. This paper looks in more detail at whether using isotopic selection of the more mechanically desirable, but prohibited due to activation, elements can improve matters. In particular, this paper focuses on the activation of Eurofer. Carefully chosen isotopically enriched elements, which are normally considered to be on the prohibited element list, are added to EUROFER steel as potential alloying elements. The EUROFER activation results show that some prohibited elements can be used as alloying elements in LAM steels, providing the selected isotopes do not have a significant impact on waste disposal rating or shut-down dose. The economic implications of isotopically enriching elements and the potential implications for decommissioning are considered. It is shown that the addition of molybdenum and nickel in small concentrations (<2% mass) could have the potential to increase availability to such an extent that the capital investment associated with isotope enrichment is negated and profits from electricity sale increased. Another important issue for materials exposed to neutron irradiation is the production of gases, in particular helium, as a result of nuclear interactions. Helium accumulation in materials can cause embrittlement and so mitigating the rate of production is an important consideration when selecting materials. The second part of this paper considers whether helium production can be reduced in CuCrZr by isotopic tailoring. CuCrZr is a candidate bonding material for tungsten at first wall locations, however it suffers from degradation due to helium production. Inventory calculations show that isotopically enriching the copper, in CuCrZr, can reduce helium production by approximately 50%. However, cost-benefit analysis suggests that the cost of enriching copper is not cost-effective due to the high price of electromagnetic enrichment that is required for copper. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Design of a linear neutron source	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						Inertial electrostatic confinement fusion; Linear neutron source; SIMION	INERTIAL-ELECTROSTATIC CONFINEMENT; CONVERGENT-BEAM FUSION; ION FOCUS; DEVICE; DISCHARGE; PLASMA; DEUTERIUM; TUNGSTEN; SYSTEM	In this paper, we present the design of a linear neutron source based on the concept of inertial electrostatic confinement fusion. The source mainly comprises of a concentric coaxial cylindrical grid assembly housed inside a double walled cylindrical vacuum chamber, a gas injection system, a high voltage feedthrough and a high voltage negative polarity power supply. The inner grid will be kept at a high negative potential with respect to the outer grid that will be grounded. The effect of grid transparency on electric potential distribution and ion trajectories has been studied using SIMION. A diffuse deuterium plasma will be initially created by making filament discharge and subsequently, on application of high negative voltage to the inner grid, deuterons will be accelerated towards the axis of the device. These deuterons will oscillate in the negative potential and consequently fuse in between the grids to produce neutrons. This source is expected to produce 10(7)-10(8) neutrons/s. The proposed linear neutron source will be operated both in the continuous and pulse modes and it will be utilized for a few near term applications namely fusion reactor material studies and explosive detection.

The different microstructures were obtained by annealing coatings at 700 degrees C or as-deposited. The film was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The hydrogen permeation inhibition performance of films was investigated by deuterium permeation experiment. The crystalline structure of the coatings depended on the post-anneal; the crystallite size of the coating increases and the surface exhibits compact surface morphology for the coatings post-annealed at 700 degrees C. The coating post-annealed at 700 degrees C has the correct oxygen/yttrium ratio corresponding well to the stoichiometric Y2O3, while some concentrations of carbon and hydrogen impurities were found in the as-deposited coating. The impurities are present in the form of unreacted or partially reacted precursor molecules due to the incomplete decomposition of the original precursor. The deuterium permeability of the coating improved obviously after post-anneal and was around 240-410 times less than that of the 316L stainless steel, which means efficient inhibition to deuterium permeation.

The levelized fuel cycle costs (LFCC) which does not include the capital cost, operation and maintenance cost have been calculated based on the equilibrium mass flows. The current once-through (OT) cycle strategy has also been analyzed to serve as the reference fuel cycle for comparisons. It is found that Strategy A and Strategy B have lower LFCCs than OT cycle; although the LFCC of Strategy C is higher than that of OT cycle when the uranium price is at its nominal value, it would become comparable to that of OT cycle when the uranium price reaches its historical peak value level; Strategy D shows the highest LFCC, because it needs to reprocess huge mass of spent nuclear fuel; LFCC is sensitive to the discharge burnup of the nuclear fuel.

ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF ERRORS ON THE ACCURACY OF CALCULATIONS OF THE NUMBER OF REACTIONS IN INDIVIDUAL VOLUMES OF THE CORE OF A WATER COOLED AND MODERATED POWER REACTOR	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								A method and numerical algorithm for evaluating the computational errors in calculating the number of fission rates in small individual volumes of a reactor core, viz., fuel element, group of fuel elements, fuel assemblies, are presented. The standard error was determined by a combination of the methods of the statistical theory of errors and linear perturbation theory. An algorithm developed for calculating the value function, sensitivity coefficients, and errors of functionals which is based on the use of the MCCG3D, TRIFON, and ERRORJ software is described. The standard error, due to, for example, the relative error similar to 1% (over the volume of a fuel element) in the microscopic fission and total cross section, of the computed fission rate in the most stressed fuel element in fuel assembly No. 10 PWR (ALMARAZ II, Spain), is evaluated as an example. The standard error of the fission reactions in this case is epsilon(f, 235U) = 5.573.10(-3), e(f, 239Pu) = 1.193.10(-3), i.e., the total error is similar to 0.67%. For other isotopes, it is hundredths of a percent, i.e., approximately equal to its computational error. For the technological error +/- 1.2% of the density of the loaded PWR uranium-dioxide fuel, the computed uncertainty in the number of fissions is +/- 0.93%, and for the uncertainty +/- 0.5% in the fuel enrichment the error in the number fissions will be +/- 1.5%.

HYDROGEN BEHAVIOR IN CHROMIUM-COATED ZIRCONIUM ALLOY E-110 DURING DEPOSITION IN A GAS DISCHARGE	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article							POLYCRYSTALLINE ZIRCONIUM; OXYGEN	The regularities and mechanisms of the processes characterizing the behavior of hydrogen in the zirconium alloy E-110 with a chromium coating were studied at different stages of the experiment: during irradiation of the substrate by ions from argon plasma and in the process of coating deposition. After ion bombardment of the zirconium, the hydrogen was retained in the interior and in the defects of the surface layer of the zirconium, and hydrogen trapping decreased with increasing residual gas pressure during irradiation in the range 1.3-30 mPa. The hydrogen atoms trapped during deposition of the chromium coating were retained primarily in the zirconium. As the pressure of the deuterium added to the residual gas during coating deposition increased, the trapping of deuterium atoms increased in the zirconium and remained unchanged in the chromium coating. Hydrogen atoms were observed to transition from the interior of the zirconium to the trapping centers in the oxide layer, which was accompanied by a reduction of the hydrogen desorption temperature and observed during ion irradiation of the substrate and coating deposition in a low vacuum.
