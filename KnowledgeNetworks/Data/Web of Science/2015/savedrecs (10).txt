The Ion Source, polarized at -112 kVdc voltage, will produce negative ions (Deuterium D- or Hydrogen H-) which, extracted from the Plasma Grid with an extraction voltage up to 12 keV, are accelerated up to 100 keV by the 100 kVdc Power Supply (100 kV PS). The required Ion Source and the Extraction Power Supplies (ISEPS) system and the associated diagnostics are hosted inside a High Voltage Deck (HVD), a -100 kVdc air-insulated Faraday cage. These power supplies and various diagnostics and control equipment are connected to the Ion Source by means of a High Voltage Transmission Line (TL). The HVD (procurement started mid 2013; delivery on site in the second half of 2014) will consist of a wide structure (13 m (L) x 11 m (W) x 5 m (H)), designed to support the weight of the ISEPS components, mounted on supporting insulators and clad with a conductive metal sheet in order to reduce the electromagnetic interference (EMI). The paper reports on the design solutions of the HVD focusing on insulation, mechanical, thermal and EMI issues. The details of the main HVD interfaces with the TL and with insulating transformer are also described. Finite Element (FE) analyses have been performed, on the one hand, to verify the configuration from the electrostatic point of view and, on the other, to evaluate electrical screen effectiveness from the EMI point of view.

For tritium operation the gas is supplied to both the ion source and neutraliser at a point close to the earth grid ("grid gas") due to the difficulty in producing a gas line with a secondary containment and a ceramic break for high voltage standoff. In preparation for the next JET tritium campaign the JET EP2 PINIs have been characterised with grid gas flow. This paper reports measurements of arc efficiency, species and divergence in both normal and grid gas operation with hydrogen and deuterium. The data is used to predict the performance in tritium operation. (C) 2015 EURATOM/CCFE Fusion Association. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It consists of an ultra-low loss CVD diamond disk mounted in a system of metallic parts (copper/steel) and has to fulfil adequate transmission capability for high power mm-waves. High power RF experiments with a 1st window prototype had shown parasitic heating due to small gaps in the housing. After a design optimization directed to the mm-wave properties, the parasitic excitations of oscillations have been avoided in a 2nd prototype. This one is equipped with inserted waveguide structures, which cover gaps in the metallic structure of the window housing. From high power RF-measurements with a 0.86 MW/100 s pulse a loss tangent of 7.1 x 10(-6) could be estimated, corresponding to an increase of temperature of only 120 mK between inlet and outlet of the cooling system. The diamond window assemblies cannot be entirely covered by codes and standards. To comply with the French safety regulations, instead an ad-hoc qualification programme is required, being developed in the framework of a contract between KIT and F4E. A new prototype (3rd) will be built, which is designed to fit to the single HELICOFLEX sealed waveguide structures of the ex-vessel mm-system of the EC upper launcher (UL). The testing programme ranges from mechanical to vacuum tests up to dielectric loss measurements at low and high power. A clear definition of the testing requirements and of the acceptance criteria is necessary as well as a complete documentation of the process. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To improve its sensitivity a dual pulse (DP) configuration, with two laser pulses delayed in the range of nanosecond to several microseconds can be used. In this work DP measurements carried out jointly by ENEA and IPPLM associations in the frame of EFDA task WP13-IPH-A01-P3-01 on samples resembling ITER in vessel components after material re-deposition (still including carbon) are presented. A DP Nd:YAG laser, operating at 1064 nm, with delay between pulses ranging from 20 ns to 80 ms and pulse duration of 8-12 ns was used to interact with tungsten sample coated with 3 pm thick mixed layer of C/Al/W (Al was used instead of Be). An enhancement of the spectroscopic emission of the elements was observed compared to the standard LIBS measurements. A Calibration Free method was applied to the data for getting the concentration of each element. Results are in good agreement with the concentrations found by the post-mortem energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Final design of the generic equatorial port plug structure for ITER diagnostic systems	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	28th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 29-OCT 03, 2014	San Sebastian, SPAIN	Spanish Res Ctr Energy Environm & Technol, CIEMAT		Diagnostics; Port plug; ITER	INTEGRATION	The Diagnostic Generic Equatorial Port Plug (GEPP) is designed to be common to all equatorial port-based diagnostic systems. It is designed to survive throughout the lifetime of ITER for 20 years, 30,000 discharges, and 3000 disruptions. The EPP structure dimensions (without Diagnostic First Walls and Diagnostic Shield Modules) are L2.9 x W1.9 x H2.4 m(3). The length of the fully integrated EPP is 3174 mm. The weight of the EPP structure is about 15 t, whereas the total weight of the integrated EPP may be up to 45 t. The EPP structure provides a flexible platform for a variety of diagnostics. The Diagnostic Shield Module assemblies, or drawers, allow a modular approach with respect to diagnostic integration and maintenance. In the nuclear phase of ITER operations, they will be remotely inserted into the EPP structure in the Hot Cell Facility. The port plug structure must also contribute to the nuclear shielding, or plugging, of the port and further contain circulated water to allow cooling during operation and heating during bake-out. The Final Design of the GEPP has been successfully passed in late 2013 and is now heading toward manufacturing. The final design of the GEPP includes interfaces, manufacturing, R&D, operation and maintenance, load cases and analysis of failure modes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Both passive and active diagnostic variants for the COMPASS tokamak are introduced. The passive diagnostic focused on the C III lines at about 465 nm is utilized for the observation of the poloidal plasma rotation. The current set-up of the measuring system is described, including the intended high-throughput optics upgrade. Different options to increase the fiber collection area are mentioned, including a flower-like fiber bundle, and the use of micro-lenses or tapered fibers. Recent measurements of poloidal plasma rotation of the order of 0-6 km/s are shown. The design of the new active diagnostic using a deuterium heating beam and based on charge exchange recombination spectroscopy (C VI line at 529 nm) is introduced. The tool will provide both space (0.5-5 cm) and time (10 ms) resolved toroidal plasma rotation and ion temperature profiles. The results of the Simulation of Spectra code used to examine the feasibility of charge exchange measurements on COMPASS are shown and connected with a selection of the spectrometer coupled with the CCD camera.

Measuring U concentration in solution product of UF6 hydrolysis using a gamma ray densitometer	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article							FLOW	UO2F2 is an intermediate in conversion of UF6 to uranium oxide or metal form and is a direct product of the reaction of UF6 with moisture in the air. UF6 will be continually hydrolyzed in the presence of water vapor. The amount of UF6 and H2O can be controlled during the hydrolysis reaction, if the concentration of U in the solution product of the hydrolysis be determined. In this paper, we have designed a c-ray densitometer with Cs-137 as gamma source with a medium energy of 662 keV for measuring the U concentration. In this research we have also studied the effect of two different activities of 10 mCi and 30 mCi on the measurement errors, and according to the results we chose the activity of 30 mCi with a relative error of 1.7 %. Finally, in order to investigate the effect of the temperature of the solution on the calibration of the apparatus, we calibrated our c-ray densitometer for two temperatures of 15 and 80 8 degrees C and it was found that the temperature modification can be attained by software correction.

It is therefore prudent that a sensitivity analysis is performed to determine and quantify the response of the output to variation in any of the input parameters. In a fissile system, the output parameter of importance is the k(eff). Therefore, in attempting to prevent reactivity-induced accidents, it is important for the criticality safety analyst to have a quantified degree of response for the neutron multiplication factor to perturbation in a given input parameter. This article will present the results of the perturbation of the parameters that are important to nuclear criticality safety analysis and their respective correlation equations for deriving the sensitivity coefficients.

ESR as a method for the characterization of alluvial sediments	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th International Conference on Luminescence and Electron Spin Resonance Dating	JUL 07-11, 2014	Montreal, CANADA			ESR; Quartz; Gamma spectrometry; Thorium; Potassium; Sources; Al; Ti	QUATERNARY SEDIMENTS; CENTER REGION; QUARTZ; DEPOSITS; SIGNALS; FRANCE	The possibility of using the parameters involved in the ESR dating of optically bleached quartz grains in a purpose of source determination was checked. In that aim, samples previously taken in different sedimentary formations of the Middle Loire Basin (Central France) and dated by ESR have been obserVed. First discrimination was made using the thorium and potassium content in the sediments obtained by gamma spectrometry. The plot of these 119 data on the Th/K Schlumberger diagram clearly demonstrated that it was possible to discriminate the clays associations included in the sediment from which the dated quartz are extracted. Clay's nature could then be indicative of the geological nature of the substratum of rivers from their sources. Second discrimination was made using the ESR intensities calculated from Al, Ti-H and Ti-Li paramagnetic centres on 18 samples. It appears that the combination of the non-bleachable aluminum trap (DAT) saturation intensity and the Ti-H/Ti-Li ratio intensities make possible the discrimination of the two main sources of the sediment: Massif Central and Paris Basin. More deeply, The Ti/OBAT (Optically bleachable aluminum traps) intensities made possible the discrimination of quartz grains of different geological sources or with different geothermal history within the Massif Central group.

Basic sediment cases, as well as a model of a micro-stratified sediment from the Mas d'Azil cave have been modeled at a few centimeters scale. The results of the simulations have highlighted different factors having a significant impact on the beta dose rate dispersion, among which the heterogeneity of the radioactive elements, the distribution of grains in the matrix and their proportion in the sample. These factors contribute to enlarge beta dose distributions and even create complex ones, and inevitably induce errors in the dating process. These effects are discussed, as well as the potential of the simulation to calculate beta dose rates in sediment samples and the necessity of using sampling protocols adapted to sediment complexity.

Burnup Credit Implementation for PWR UOX Used Fuel Assemblies in France: From Study to Practical Experience	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM VALIDATION	Burnup credit for used fuel assemblies, in particular, pressurized water reactor uranium oxide, has been a major focus of research in France for more than 30 years. As a result, a wealth of knowledge and experience has been gained. The first implementation of burnup credit in France used the "50-least-irradiated-cm" method approved by the French safety authority in the early 1980s. However, because of the continuous increase in fuel enrichment, the industry is interested in reducing the conservatisms of this method by taking into consideration more realistic hypotheses, such as the introduction of fission products and a nonuniform axial burn up profile. To address this concern, a working group, bringing together several French nuclear companies and institutions [AREVA, CEA (Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives), EDF (Electricite de France), and IRSN (Institut de Radioprotection et de Surete Nucleaire)], was created in 1997. This paper presents the results of the working group's discussions and studies on all the issues pertaining to the use of burnup credit. In addition, the practical experience of AREVA TN (a division of AREVA dealing with radioactive materials transport and storage throughout the entire nuclear fuel cycle) with transport casks, using input from these results, is described.

This formation of nickel ferrite instead of hematite accelerates cobalt buildup, and this is especially notable for carbon steel. The observed reduction of radioactivity concentration in reactor water by zinc injection or by nickel/iron ratio control can be explained by the role of zinc or nickel in preventing the film on the fuel rod surfaces from changing to hematite, thereby stabilizing the cobalt activity on this surface. A thermodynamic evaluation suggests that zinc ferrite is more stable than cobalt ferrite only when the ratio of cobalt to zinc divalent ions, [Co2+]/[Zn2+], is <0.011 in molar units. This ratio is consistent with the ratio of Co-60 activity to zinc concentration commonly used in industry to control reactor water zinc levels for a dose rate reduction under the hydrogen water chemistry condition. Based on the present understanding of radioactivity behaviors, the actual radiation dose reduction methods are classified into the several groups and summarized from the viewpoint of the interaction between the oxide and various metal ions.

Disposing such sizable radwaste in geologic repositories is not a viable option. We suggest changing what is now a costly waste disposal concern for fusion energy into a valued commodity through the further development of the recycling and clearance approaches. This paper reports the outcome of two recent activities that identified the challenges of handling the radioactive materials of ARIES-ACT-2 power plant along with the required design changes and R&D programs that make the recycling/clearance approach a reality, and the development of a new detritiation code that predicts the efficiency of tritium recovery from metallic materials an essential process before recycling.

A Preliminary Safety Report in under preparation for the siting of the Ignitor experiment in Troitsk. A specific site has been selected, with characteristics determined from informations regarding TRINITI. This site has many positive characteristics, such as the presence of electrical facilities because of nearby distribution nodes, and the full availability of the required room for the arrangement of all Ignitor buildings. The results of the analyses, both regarding doses to population and personnel, and other environmental impacts, show that the TRINITI site in Troitsk is a consistent choice for Ignitor localisation, according to the safety and the environmental impact point of view.

It was found that D retention behavior for He+ implanted W was not limited by the size of the He bubbles. The microstructure observation showed that the large helium bubbles were formed near the surface for He+ implanted W at 1173 K, suggesting that the D retention was reduced by the growth of the helium bubbles. In addition, to evaluate the effect of implantation ion species at high temperature, D retention behavior for He+ implanted W at 1173 K was compared with that for C+ implanted W at 673 K It is concluded that the D retention depends on ion species, which makes different kinds of damages like He bubbles for He+ implantation and vacancy-ion complex (voids) for C+ implantation.

In the spirit of advanced engineering, the vacuum vessel design employed several novel concepts. It eliminates the use of water cooling in order to allow higher temperature operation and reduce the tritium inventory. It employs a low activation bainitic steel that eliminates the need for post-weld heat treatment. It includes sufficient volume to accommodate a full loss of coolant accident. Finally, it employs a novel mechanical design in order to withstand the operating stresses during normal operation, anticipated transients, and disruptions. In this paper, we present the most recent design for this component, update the stress analysis confirming the suitability of the design, and present results for disruption forces due to a plasma quench.

The HFFR concept envisioned is one with a simple cylindrical geometry, using an anticipated variant of a magnetic mirror to confine a deuterium-tritium (DT) fusion plasma. The annular-cylindrical blanket is approximately 10 meters long and 2 meters thick, and is a repeating lattice of pressure tubes filled with 0.5-meter fuel bundles that are made of (U-233,Th)O-2, and refuelled continuously on-line, sharing technological features with pressure-tube heavy water reactors (PT-HWR) and the Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor (AGR) in the U.K. With a 2-meter thick blanket, the average fissile content in the blanket needs to be at least 2.5 wt% in order for the HFFR system to be self-sustaining in power.

A NUMERICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE THERMAL-HYDRAULICS OF THE HELIUM-COOLED MODULAR DIVERTOR WITH MULTIPLE JETS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	21st American-Nuclear-Society (ANS) Topical Meeting on the Technology of Fusion Energy (TOFE)	NOV 10-13, 2014	Anaheim, CA	Amer Nucl Soc, US Dept Energy, Off Fusion Energy Sci			PERFORMANCE	Three-dimensional numerical simulations of a test section modeling a single module of the helium-cooled modular divertor with multiple jets (HEMJ) design were performed to complement experimental studies at nearly prototypical conditions as part of the joint US-Japan effort on plasma-facing components evaluation by tritium plasma, heat, and neutron irradiation experiments (PHENIX). The Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model gave numerical predictions of the cooled surface temperature that were in good agreement with experimental estimates from a new helium loop. The simulations showed that spatial variations in incident heat flux, at least in the form of a Gaussian function, had a negligible effect on cooled surface temperatures. Our initial results indicate that the numerical predictions of the thermal performance of a single HEMJ module are in reasonable agreement with the experimental studies. The simulations do, however, predict slightly higher heat transfer coefficients (HTCs) than the experimental studies, presumably because they do not account for thermal losses. The HTC appears to be essentially independent of incident heat flux, suggesting that the model can be used to investigate parameters that cannot be determined experimentally in many cases, such as the local HTC and temperature distributions within the divertor pressure boundary, at prototypical conditions.

BURN UP STUDY OF AN INNOVATIVE NATURAL URANIUM-THORIUM FUELED REPROCESSING FREE FUSION-FISSION HYBRID REACTOR BLANKET WITH CLOSED THORIUM-URANIUM FUEL CYCLE	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	21st American-Nuclear-Society (ANS) Topical Meeting on the Technology of Fusion Energy (TOFE)	NOV 10-13, 2014	Anaheim, CA	Amer Nucl Soc, US Dept Energy, Off Fusion Energy Sci				In this paper, an innovative natural uranium-thorium fuel fusion-fission hybrid reactor (FFHR) design aiming at closed thorium-uranium fuel cycle, and which could operate with high energy gain, fast U-233 breeding rate and tritium self-sufficiency, is presented. The reactor consists of two main modules, i.e. natural uranium module and thorium module, which are placed alternately in the blanket's toroidal direction. Uranium module plays the role of energy generation and neutron multiplication at the initial stage. Excess neutrons are then used to drive the thorium module to breed U-233 After the U-233 inventory reaches a certain level, the uranium module is then replaced by new thorium fuel module. The system is transition to the all thorium fueled operating mode. With appropriately selected thorium fuel to water volumetric ratio, the system could then be started by the limited bred U-233. The blanket could reach thorium-uranium closed fuel cycle with high energy gain and tritium self-sufficiency. The system could burn up about 90 tonnes Th-232 at the end of 60 years operating.

A NEW HYDROGEN PROCESSING DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	21st American-Nuclear-Society (ANS) Topical Meeting on the Technology of Fusion Energy (TOFE)	NOV 10-13, 2014	Anaheim, CA	Amer Nucl Soc, US Dept Energy, Off Fusion Energy Sci			ISOTOPE-SEPARATION PROCESS; TRITIUM; PALLADIUM	The design of many of the process systems at the Savannah River Site (SRS)Tritium Facilities were developed at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) in the 1980's and early 1990's for Cold War production requirements. Most of the process systems developed used cold (non-radioactive) test systems to reduce the cost of developing pilot and full-scale test systems. The metal hydride (MH) based process technologies developed for the Replacement Tritium Facility (RTF) allowed tritium process equipment to be confined in tritium stripped glovebox systems which greatly reduced tritium emissions to the public. Facility start-up in 1994 was considered state-of-the art technology for the world's largest metal hydride based tritium process facility. The end of the Cold War reduced production requirements, but increased maintenance is needed for the 20 year old process systems. The Hydrogen Processing Development System (HPDS) is a new, non-radiological R&D system to be built for testing and demonstrating improved process systems for SRS Tritium Facilities. Experience gained from facility operations and new concepts from fusion fuel cycle development programs will be used to develop improved processes and restore base capabilities of the SRS Tritium Facilities. The HPDS will be designed to test systems such as a Revised Unloading Purification System (R UPS), an optimized advanced storage and isotope separation (OASIS) System, a Reduced Area Confinement and WAter Processing (RACWAP) System, and some components of a separate breeding and extraction program. New processes would retain the desirable features of the current/existing technologies while creating "right-sized" and flexible advanced or hybrid system to meet current and future tritium processing needs. Testing in the HPDS will reduce the cost and risk of deploying new technologies into the SRS tritium production process.	[Klein, J. E.; Poore, A. S.; Xiao, X.; Babineau, D.

These materials must be capable of withstanding high temperature and neutron flux. Nevertheless, using hybrid systems, the first wall material choice could influence the criticality system due to the different properties of each material. To analyze this influence, two hybrid reactors were evaluated. The first one is a Tokamak based on magnetic confinement and the second one based on inertial confinement. Both systems contain a transmutation layer with reprocessed fuel spiked with thorium. The results showed the principal nuclides affected in the transmutation layer and the differences in the criticality due to neutron flux variations produced by the changes in the first wall material.

From viewpoints of tritium safety and recovery efficiency, tritium confinement is an important issue. It is known that alumina has high resistance for gas permeation. In this study, hydrogen permeation experiments in commercial alumina tubes were conducted and hydrogen permeability, diffusivity and solubility were evaluated By using obtained data, tritium permeation behavior from an Al2O3-coated Li-compound particle was simulated Additionally, by using literature data for hydrogen behavior in zirconium, an effect of Zr incorporation into an Al2O3 coating on tritium permeation was discussed It was indicated that the majority of produced tritium was released through the Al2O3 coating above 500 degrees C. However, it is expected that total tritium leak is suppressed to below 0.67 % of total tritium produced at 500 degrees C by incorporating Zr fine particles into the inside of Al2O3 coating, assuming tritium pressure inside particle is kept at the plateau pressure of the Zr hydride generation reaction.

PLUTONIUM TRANSMUTATION BY A GAS DYNAMIC TRAP HYBRID REACTOR	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	21st American-Nuclear-Society (ANS) Topical Meeting on the Technology of Fusion Energy (TOFE)	NOV 10-13, 2014	Anaheim, CA	Amer Nucl Soc, US Dept Energy, Off Fusion Energy Sci			SYSTEM; DESIGN; MIRROR	A team at the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics has been working for several years to develop the Gas Dynamic Trap Mirror Neutron Source (GDT-NS) for fusion materials irradiation. In 2010 they optimized the design for a transmutation mission forecasting a 16 meter DT plasma with a fusion power of 15 MW and neutrons preferentially emitted into blankets placed around the mirror turning points. While this remains to be demonstrated experimentally, it is intriguing to explore what could be done with a low fusion power neutron source. The GDT-NS team has previously modeled the burning of minor actinides. The work presented here builds on this by examining the burning of plutonium starting with transuranics recovered from spent nuclear fuel. It was found that a GDT plutonium burner with two blankets could eliminate nearly the plutonium produced in a single light water reactor core per full power year, 249 kg. By increasing the average blanket power with regular refueling, this quantity was increased to 381 kg per full power year. Next followed a preliminary overview of a GDT disposition blanket to meet US treaty commitments in burning surplus military plutonium.	[Sims, B.; Bean, R. S.; Choi, C.

Effect of Atomic-Molecular and Isotopic Composition of an Ion Beam on the Neutron Yield from Tamped Targets in Sealed Tubes	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								A neutron generator with a sealed tube is a controlled electrophysical source of fast neutrons which is safe in the off state. A tritium- and deuterium-saturated target is bombarded by a beam of deuterium and tritium ions in order to obtain neutrons. The neutrons are formed in the reactions H-3(d, n)He-4 and H-2(d, n)He-3. Generators are used in nuclear geophysics, inspection systems for detecting dangerous substances, thermonuclear research, and other fields of industry and science. A method is presented for calculating the neutron yield from the targets in sealed tubes in generators, taking account of the accelerating voltage, the atomic-molecular and isotopic composition of the ion beam, and the properties of the target. The computational method presented makes it possible to obtain the dependences of the neutron yield on the operating parameters of gas-filled sealed tubes. The expressions obtained can be used for almost all solid-state targets currently used in generators.

Generalized Approach to Comparative Assessment of the Effect of Radiation from Nuclear Fuel Cycles on Biota	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article							POPULATION	An approach to evaluating a generalized index of the radiation effect of NFC objects on biota is proposed. The effect of the radiation factor on the collection of representative natural organisms belonging to difference taxonomic groups is taken into account. The change in the proposed index for individual actinides flowing with activity 1 MBq into the environment and their decay products is calculated. The actinides present in spent fuel are considered in the calculations: Am-241,Am-242m,Am-242,Am-243, Cm242-248, Np-237, Pu-238-242,Pu-244, and U-235,U-236,U-238. The index developed is suitable for radioecological assessment of the objects of open and closed fuel cycles. The results of such assessment are an important element of the environmental validation of new nuclear power technologies.	[Spiridonov, S. I.; Aleksakhin, R.

MgB2 wire would become an alternative material for Nb-Ti wire for the Poloidal Field and correction feedback coils, if the critical current density (J(c)) around the magnetic field of 4T could be improved. We found that addition of Cu using the compound Mg2Cu was an effective method to enhancek and succeed to fabricate 100 m length of MgB2 wire with Cu addition. Jc of the 100 m long MgB2 with Cu addition was comparable to that of a NbTi wire, and the small solenoid coil using Cu added MgB2 wire reached a central magnetic field of 2.62T. We found that MgB2 wire is an alternative material to commercial NbTi wires under the hard neutron irradiation in a fusion reactor. Furthermore, we also fabricated a Cu added MgB2 wire using isotope pure boron-11 (B-11) powder as the boron source to reduce the radioactivity. The critical temperature (T-c) of the MgB2 wire using B-11 powder was found to be 37K, and T-c was found to be changed by different boron materials. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

An estimate of the engineering limit of the FW heat load capacity is an essential input for this decision. This paper describes the work performed to optimize the FW of the Water Cooled Lithium-Lead (WCLL) blanket concept for DEMO fusion reactor in order to increase its maximum heat load capacity. The optimization is based on the use of water at typical Pressurised Water Reactors conditions as coolant. The present WCLL FW with a waved plasma-faced surface and with circular channels was studied and the heat load limit has been predicted with FEM analysis equal to 1.0 MW m(-2) with respect to the Eurofer temperature limit. An optimization study was then carried out for a flat FW design considering thermal and mechanical constraints assuming inlet and outlet temperatures equal to 285 degrees C/325 degrees C respectively and based on geometric design parameters such as channel pitch, diameter of pipes and thicknesses. It became clear through the optimization that the advantages of a waved FW are diminished. Given the manufacturing issues of that concept, the waved FW was therefore not pursued further. Even if the optimization study shows that the maximum heat load could in principle be as high as 2.53 MW m(-2), it is reduced to 1.57 MW m(-2) when additional constraints are introduced in order not to affect corrosion, manufacturability and Tritium Breeding Ratio in normal condition such as a coolant velocity <= 8 m/s, pipe diameter >= 5 mm and a total FW thickness <= 22 mm. However it is important to note that the FW channels currently fulfill additional functions and are therefore not optimized "at all cost" regarding heat load capacity and the paper points out some recommendations against missing assumptions. 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The heat pulses were simulated by laser irradiation. A Nd:YAG laser with energy per pulse of up to 32J and a duration of 1 ms at the fundamental wavelength (lambda = 1064 nm, repetition rate 0.5 Hz) was used to irradiate 1TER-grade W samples with repetitive heat loads. In contrast to pure thermal exposure with a laser beam where the damage threshold under pure heat loads for ITER-grade Wiles between 0.38 and 0.76 GW/m(2), the experiments with pre-loaded W-samples as well as under combined loading conditions show a lower damage threshold of 0.3 GW/m(2). This is probably due to deuterium embrittlement and/or a higher defect concentration in a region close to the surface due to supersaturation with deuterium. A pronounced increase in the D retention (more than a factor of five) has been observed during the combined transient heat loads and plasma exposure. Enhanced blister formation has been observed under these combined loading conditions. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Investigation of various nozzles configurations with respect to IFMIF and liquid walls concepts	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	28th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 29-OCT 03, 2014	San Sebastian, SPAIN	Spanish Res Ctr Energy Environm & Technol		Free surface flows; Turbulence; IFMIF; Shima nozzle	FREE-SURFACE; PLASMA; METAL	The study of liquid-metal free surface flows is of great interest in the fusion research, for example in the IFMIF and liquid walls concepts. In the IFMIF project, the main goal is to test candidate metallic materials in irradiation conditions similar to those present in a fusion reactor. More specifically, an intense neutron source will be produced by bombarding a high-speed liquid lithium target jet with two deuterium beams of 40 MeV. The source will then be used to test samples of the candidate materials. In the so called "Liquid walls" project, the use of liquid film free surface flows as plasma facing components (PFCs) is studied as an alternative to metallic plasma facing materials. The free surface PFCs could result in important advantages over solid walls, such as the minimization of corrosion defects and faster maintenance. In both concepts the feeding of the liquid film will be achieved by the use of a nozzle. The main scope of this work is to focus on the optimization of the flow uniformity that comes out from the nozzle. According to the literature, the use of nozzles based on the Shima profile formulation has been favoured to improve the film stability. Based on the above, a number of flows springing from several variations of "Shima" type nozzles are numerically investigated here with main goal to define the most optimum geometry in terms of minimizing turbulent defects and flow deformations.

In this work, tungsten deposition layers having different thickness and porosity were formed on circular nickel plates by hydrogen RF plasma sputtering. Hydrogen permeation experiment was carried out at the temperature range from 250 degrees C to 500 degrees C and at hydrogen pressure range from 1013 Pa to 101,300 Pa. The hydrogen permeation flux through the nickel plate with tungsten deposition layer was significantly smaller than that through a bare nickel plate. This indicates that a rate-controlling step in hydrogen permeation was not permeation through the nickel plate but permeation though the deposition layer. The pressure dependence on the permeation flux differed by temperature. Hydrogen permeation flux through tungsten deposition layer is larger than that through tungsten bulk. From analysis of the permeation curves, it was indicated that hydrogen diffusivity in tungsten deposition layer is smaller than that in tungsten bulk and the equilibrium hydrogen concentration in tungsten deposition layer is enormously larger than that in tungsten bulk at same hydrogen pressure.

To this end, samples extracted from the divertor tiles of ASDEX Upgrade after the 2009 plasma operations were analyzed using LIBS for their composition and the results were compared with other postmortem deposition data. Quantitative depth profiles for the elemental concentrations were extracted from LIBS spectra by applying a novel data processing method. In addition, both multiline and multispot averaging procedures were applied to reduce fluctuations in the data. The LIBS concentration profiles matched qualitatively with those given by secondary ion mass spectrometry and quantitatively with the ion-beam data. The deuterium content of the samples could be reliably determined if the surface densities were >10(17) at/cm(2). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The surfaces were analysed with electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and ion beam techniques. The results are consistent with well-established outcomes arising from helium irradiation, evidencing that the degassing mechanisms depend of the microstructure evolution. They point to a supersaturation of the implanted zone by helium in the samples exposed to fluences of 5e17 He+/cm(2). In this case, it is observed a simultaneous release of helium and deuterium at lower temperatures, evidencing the formation of a porous microstructure from primary gas bubbles. In the absence of a porous structure, the helium degassing occurs at a higher temperature range, while it depends on the migration of helium-vacancy clusters. The supersaturation of beryllium was never reached under single deuterium irradiation, being the release of deuterium controlled by ion-induced trap sites. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Its designed main parameters are major/minor radii of 5.7 m/1.6 m and plasma current of 10 MA. Although the fusion power is lower than the one of ITER, the relative smaller machine dimensions and planed much higher auxiliary heating power of 100-140 MW make that the power exhausting for the CFETR divertor is a very critical issue. To solve this issue, the divertor should be better designed with advanced physical operation mode, advanced configuration/geometry or high efficient cooling structure. In the paper, much effort was put on the divertor configuration and geometry. With designed magnet system, three divertor configurations can be realized, ITER-like, snowflake and super-X. However, considering structural design feasibility and remote handling compatibility, only the first two configurations were selected for the first step of engineering design. Three divertors were designed. They have different first wall geometries to accommodate with different plasma configurations, one for the ITER-like, one for the snowflake and the third one for both the configurations. All three divertors employ the same cassette body as the support and the cooling water manifold for the first wall. This feature simplifies the interface of the divertor to other components in the vacuum vessel. Besides, the cooling structure and the remote maintenance concept are also introduced in the paper.

Initial DEMO tokamak design configuration studies	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	28th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 29-OCT 03, 2014	San Sebastian, SPAIN	Spanish Res Ctr Energy Environm & Technol		Tokamak; DEMO; Power plant		To prepare the DEMO conceptual design phase a number of physics and engineering assessments were carried out in recent years in the frame of EFDA concluding in an initial design configuration of a DEMO tokamak. This paper gives an insight into the identified engineering requirements and constraints and describes their impact on the selection of the technologies and design principles of the main tokamak components. The EU DEMO program aims at making best use of the technologies developed for ITER (e.g., magnets, vessel, cryostat, and to some degree also the divertor). However, other systems in particular the breeding blanket require design solutions and advanced technologies that will only partially be tested in ITER. The main differences from ITER include the requirement to breed, to extract, to process and to recycle the tritium needed for plasma operation, the two orders of magnitude larger lifetime neutron fluence, the consequent radiation dose levels, which limit remote maintenance options, and the requirement to use low-activation steel for in-vessel components that also must operate at high temperature for efficient energy conversion.

The MPD provides the means for deployment and handling of in-vessel tools or components inside the vacuum vessel (VV) for dust and tritium inventory control, in-service inspection, leak localization, and in-vessel diagnostics. It also supports the operation of blanket first wall maintenance and neutral beam duct liner module maintenance operations. This paper describes the concept design of the MPD. The MPD is a cask based system, i.e. it stays in the hot cell building during the machine operation, and is deployed to the VV using the cask system for the in-vessel operations. The main part of the MPD is the articulated transporter which provides transportation and positioning of the in-vessel tools or components. The articulated transporter has nine degrees of freedom with a payload capacity up to 2 tons. The articulated transporter can cover the whole internal surface of the VV by switching between the four equatorial RH ports. Additionally it can use two non-RH equatorial ports to transfer large tools or components. A concept for in-cask tool exchange is developed which minimizes the cask transportation by allowing the MPD to stay in the VV during the tool exchange. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The development and validation of remotely operable leak-free pipe connectors for helium, water and liquid metal is a key issue for faster and more reliable replacement of in-vessel components. In this work, some advances in the design of a connector by brazing for DEMO blanket pipes are presented. A new clamping concept to stiffen the connector is proposed, although different previous works suggest the mechanical strength of the brazed joint could be enough and the clamp may not be necessary. A characterization of the mechanical behavior of the brazed joint, a CFD approach for modeling the capillary flow of the BAu-4 filler metal during the brazing process and a preliminary assessment on the issue of tritium permeation are included.

The workspace of a CDPR is only limited by the length of the cables, and the payload capacity related to the mass of the whole robot is very important. Besides, the control being based on kinematic models, the behavior of a CDPR is really that of a robot capable of automated trajectories or remote handling. The present paper gives a presentation of two use case studies based on some of the assembly phases and remote handling actions as designed for the recent fusion machines. Based on the use cases already in place in fusion reactor baselines, the opportunity of using CDPR for assembly of structural elements and coils is discussed. Finally, prospects for remote handling equipment from the reactor in hot cells are envisioned based on current CDPR research. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In these ports, two TBM-Sets are mechanically attached in a TBM Frame to form a TBM port plug (TBM PP). The ITER Organization is responsible for the design and manufacture of both this TBM Frame and the Dummy TBMs which will fill them. As a part of this development, in 2013, a conceptual design review (CDR) of TBM PP with two dummy TBMs revealed the need for improvement of design performance, interfaces and maintainability.

These materials must withstand reactor relevant high neutron fluxes which change structure and properties of the material and radio-activate it. The impact of neutron damage on plasma-material interaction with respect to thermal and particle loads is investigated in customized linear plasma generators in a hot cell. In order to avoid emission of possibly radioactive contamination and to get stable conditioning a remote handling system including lock system for the samples was developed for the yilich plasma generator (JULE-PSI). All mountings and operations like moving and fixing the sample are designed such that maintenance and revisions are minimized at a high level of operational safety and availability. For instance, actuators are arranged outside the vacuum as much as possible. Furthermore in case of problems the radioactive sample can be removed from the vessel in a simple and reliable way. Concepts and detailed solutions are presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The final design will be elaborated by the European consortium ECHUL-CA with contributions from several research institutes in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Within this consortium KIT is responsible for the design of the structural components (the upper port plug, UPP) and also the design integration of the launcher. As the selection of applicable codes and standards was under discussion for the past decade, the conceptual and the preliminary design of the launcher structure were not elaborated in straight accordance with a particular code but with a variety of well-acknowledged engineering practices. For the final design it is compulsory to validate the design with respect to a typical engineering code in order to be compliant with the ITER quality and nuclear requirements and to get acceptance from the French regulator. This paper presents typical design validation of the closure plate, which is the vacuum and Tritium barrier and thus a safety relevant component of the upper port plug (UPP), performed with the ASME boiler and pressure vessel code. Rationales for choosing this code are given as well as a comparison between different design methods, like the "design by rule" and the "design by analysis" approach. Also the selections of proper load specifications and the identification of potential failure modes are covered. In addition to that stress categorizations, analyses results, and prove of the soundness of the design are presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Therefore, the maintenance schemes should satisfy many design requirements and criteria to assure reliable and safe plant operation and to attain reasonable plant availability. The plant availability depends on reliability of remote maintenance scheme, inspection of pipe connection and plasma operation. In this paper, various remote maintenance schemes for DEMO were comparatively assessed based on requirements for DEMO remote maintenance. From the view points of the reliability of inspection on hot cell, TF coil size, stored energy of PF coil and portability of segment, the banana shape segment transport using all vertical maintenance ports would be more probable DEMO reactor maintenance scheme, and it has key engineering issues such as in-vessel transferring mechanism of segment, pipe connection and conducting shell design for plasma vertical stability.

Because of erosion with hazardous and/or activated dust (beryllium, carbon, tungsten) and tritium, the use of remote handling techniques will be eventually required. In particular, the replacement of components such as divertor modules will require the use of remote cutting, welding and inspection of cooling pipes. CFETR consists of 44 divertor (tow sizes) cassettes located in the bottom region of the vacuum vessel. The cassettes will be withdrawn from the vessel through four dedicated ports and transported to a hot cell for refurbishment and replacement during the reactor's operational lifetime. The divertor system remote replacement is one of the key maintenance operations for the CFETR due to the requirements of duty factor (0.3-0.5), machine safety, high plant availability and reliability. The critical issues such as the operational conditions (temperature, atmosphere, radiation, and contamination), maintenance functions, and mechanical design requirements of the divertor remote handling maintenance system (RHMS) are described. The concept design of the remote handling equipment, the operating procedures and the maintenance time estimations for high plant availability are also discussed in this paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Operating modes of electrochemical H-concentration probes for tritium sensors	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	28th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 29-OCT 03, 2014	San Sebastian, SPAIN	Spanish Res Ctr Energy Environm & Technol		Liquid blanket; Proton conducting ceramics; Sensor; Hydrogen; Tritium	SOLID-ELECTROLYTE; HYDROGEN; CONDUCTION; CERAMICS; CELL	Potentiometric hydrogen sensors using different solid-state electrolytes have been designed and tested at the Electrochemical Methods Lab at Institut Quimic de Sarria (IQS). The most promising element (Sr(Ce-0.9-Zr-0.1)(0.95)Yb0.05O3-alpha) has been selected for this work in order to evaluate the sensor performance at different hydrogen concentrations in two different operating modes: amperometric and potentiometric. In addition, the sensor response has been evaluated at different working temperatures (500, 575 and 650 degrees C). The experiments performed proved that when the sensor was used in a potentiometric mode, there is a threshold hydrogen concentration that the sensor can detect depending on the working conditions: 15 mbar at 575 degrees C and 10 mbar 650 degrees C. At 500 degrees C the minimum working temperature of this ceramic has not been achieved, so large deviations between experimental data and theoretical calculations has been obtained. When the sensor was used in an amperometric mode the obtained currents increased as a function of the applied voltage. At a fixed potential, the higher the temperature the higher the current was. So the sensor sensitivity can be tuned by changing the applied voltage at a fixed temperature and hydrogen concentration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
