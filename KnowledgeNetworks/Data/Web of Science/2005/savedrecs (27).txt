Yet they are rare metal fission products (RMFP), most are long-lived (LLFP; Pd, Tc, Se, Te). In the applied electrochemical separation process, Pd2+ cation itself would not only be easily deposited from various nitric acid solutions, but enhance also the deposition of RuNO3+ and ReO4- by acting as a catalyst (as Pd-adatom). Such Catalytic Electrolytic Extraction (CEE) method was found to be applicable in the case of TcO4- deposition. The quaternary-, Pd-Ru-Rh-Re, deposit Pt electrodes showed the highest cathodic current corresponding to the hydrogen evolution reaction, ca. twice superior to that of the Pt electrode in artificial sea water as well as in alkaline solution. Adsorption / desorption behavior of Ru-106, etc. on the tertiary pyridine resin, being set as a pre-separation step to the CEE process, was newly confirmed by the reprocessing experiments with a highly irradiated fast reactor MOX fuel. The promising utilization of recovered RMFP will be a "FP-catalyst" for electrolytic hydrogen production, where they would be circulating material to bridge nuclear and hydrogen energy systems.

The shell defines an internal cavity where a metal is encapsulated. Although the rare-earth carbides readily hydrolyze in moist air, the carbides in these carbon shells did not degrade after exposure to air for considerable lengths of time. This means that the carbide particle is physically enclosed within the carbon cavity completely, and the cavity protects it perfectly against attack of water molecules. Considering intrinsic chemical stability of carbon under oxygen free condition, this structure may be a perfect barrier to extremely long-term release of radionuclides. Because encapsulation of LaC2 within carbon nanoparticles increased drastically from by-product to major product, it would be possible to find the optimized condition that complete encapsulation is achieved. Intrinsic stability of carbon and carbon coated waste nanoparticles may provide an improved barrier to radionuclide release by groundwater. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kang, JM				Kang, JM			Analysis of nuclear proliferation resistance	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st COE-INES International Symposium (INES-1)	OCT 31-NOV 04, 2004	Tokyo, JAPAN			nuclear energy systems; proliferation resistance; intrinsic barriers; institutional measures		All the civil nuclear energy systems could contribute to the proliferation risk that weapons-usable material might be diverted or misused for the weapons purpose by terrorists or states. Proliferation-resistant nuclear energy systems are of great importance for the peaceful use of nuclear energy by impeding the diversion or undeclared production of weapons-usable material by states. Since the National Alternative Systems Assessment Program (NASAP) carried out the assessment of proliferation resistance of the civil nuclear energy systems in late 1970s, several comprehensive studies have been performed, including the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation (INFCE) by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Spent Fuel Standard by the United States National Academy of Science, the Technical Opportunities for Increasing the Proliferation Resistance of Global Civilian Nuclear Power Systems (TOPS) by the United States Department of Energy, the International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles (INPRO) Methodology by the IAEA, and the Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems (Gen IV) by the Gen IV International Forum. However, all these studies appear lack in the interpretation of country-specific proliferation risk that is arbitrary imposed to the specific countries by major nuclear weapons states, even though the countries are members of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). This paper outlines the assessments of proliferation resistance of the above studies, points out the country-specific proliferation risk, and suggests further studies to increase the proliferation resistance of the civil nuclear energy systems in the specific NPT member countries such as South Korea.

Under conditions of the closed LWR cycle the proliferation-resistance levels were evaluated for fresh and spent MOX-fuel doped with Pa-231 and U-232. According to the evaluations, it was derived that cyclic regime with Pa-U feeding at the level of 5% HM makes it possible to achieve the proliferation resistance of fresh MOX-fuel at the level high enough to protect it against short-term unauthorized actions (receiving the lethal dose for about 10 minutes in the vicinity of MOX-fuel assembly) and also against the acts of terrorism (receiving the shock lethal dose for a few minutes).

Intrinsic properties of plutonium isotopes with even mass numbers (Pu-238, Pu-240 and Pu-242) - in terms of their intense decay heat and high spontaneous fission neutron rates - were used as a measure to improve the proliferation resistance of plutonium itself. The present study explores MA addition effect into LEU (5% U-235) and HEU (20% U-235) with regard to plutonium proliferation resistance characteristics. Consideration goes beyond critical condition to examine the potential of subcritical system in enhancing the plutonium proliferation properties. Results show that even the doping level of 1% of Np, TrPu or all MA elements into low enriched uranium improves the proliferation-resistant properties of plutonium. A potential for further improvement is achieved by higher doping of minor actinides into high enriched uranium irradiated in a subcritical mode. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The fuel of such reactors being liquid, it can be easily reprocessed to overcome neutronic limits. In the late sixties, the MSBR project showed that breeding is possible with thorium in a thermal spectrum, provided that an efficient pyrochemical reprocessing is added. With tools developed around the Monte Carlo MCNP code, we first re-evaluate the performance of a MSBR-like reference system with Th-232/U-233 fuel. We find an important reduction of inventories and induced radiotoxicities at equilibrium compared to other fuel cycles, with a doubling time of about thirty years. We then study how to start this interesting reference system with the plutonium from PWR spent fuel. Such a transition appears slow and difficult, since it is very sensitive to the fissile quality of the plutonium used. Deployment scenarios of Th-232/U-233 MSBR-like systems from the existing French PWRs demonstrate the advantage of an upstream U-233 production in other reactors, allowing a direct start of the MSBR-like systems with U-233. This finally leads us to explore alternatives to some MSBR features, for energy production with Th-232/U-233 fuel from the start. We thus test different options, especially in terms of core neutronics optimization and reprocessing unit adaptation. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

There are many nuclear fuel performance codes, some of which are available in public domain. The recent fuel design and improvement activities are focused on to extend the burnup, of fuel, and the use of new materials. Thus, the most important limitation of codes is the burnup, validity limit.

J	Hwang, YS				Hwang, YS			Environmental impact of advanced management of spent nuclear fuel on permanent disposal of high level waste in Korea	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								The current policy for the ultimate management of spent nuclear fuel in Korea is "wait and see." However, many R&D subjects such as direct disposal, partitioning and transmutation and the advanced management of spent nuclear fuel are being studied. The advanced management of spent nuclear fuel process focuses on two issues of permanent disposal: minimization of a repository area and reduction of the probabilities of fatal risks. The advanced management of spent nuclear fuel process removes heat sources such as Sr and Cs. It significantly reduces the repository area. Also, it halts the instantaneous release of volatile nuclides. In turn, dissolution rates of nuclides from an ingot are limited by that of a matrix form, which significantly reduces probabilities of fatal risks. Reduction of a repository area and potential post closure risks are a major benefit of advanced management of spent nuclear fuel. In the future, a more detailed study on environmental impact and economical benefit will be performed.

These methods allow the transformation of a liquid radioactive waste into an inert form, suitable for a final disposal. To assess the safety for disposal of radioactive mortar-waste composition, the leaching of Cs-137 from immobilized radioactive evaporator concentrate into a surrounding fluid has been studied. Leaching tests were carried out in accordance with a method recommended by IAEA. Determination of retardation factors, K-F, and coefficients of distribution, k(d), using a simplified mathematical model for analyzing the migration of radionuclides, has, been developed. In our experiment we have achieved the lowest leaching values after 60 days in samples. Results presented in this paper are examples of results obtained in a 20 year mortar and concrete testing project, which will influence the design of the engineered trenches system for a future central Serbian radioactive waste disposal center (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

J	Fiordaliso, A; Kunsch, P				Fiordaliso, A; Kunsch, P			A decision supported system based on the combination of fuzzy expert estimates to assess the financial risks in high-level radioactive waste projects.	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Applied Computational Intellignece	SEP 01-03, 2004	Blankenberge, BELGIUM			decision supported system; fuzzy rules; radioactive waste management		This paper describes the technical aspects of the implementation of a Decision Aid System developed at ONDRAF/NIRAS/NERAS, the Belgian radioactive waste management agency. The proposed system is intended to deal with the economic and financial uncertainties inherent to Radioactive Waste Management (RWM) and especially to Mgh-Level-Waste (HLW) repository projects. The economic calculus of such projects are particularly difficult due to many uncertainties that still exist regarding the final design, the eventual costs and the realization schedule. The general approach mainly relies on fuzzy logic rule-based systems to infer contingency or margin factors in such uncertain contexts. The parameters of the fuzzy models are identified based on preliminary rough estimates of the financial risks. This calibration enables to build a default system that can be further refined by the introduction of experts advices. The implemented software allows to introduce new information when available with the possibility to adjust the experts credibility.

The soil on the earth's crust is a source of continuous exposure to human beings. The amount of radioactivity in soil depends upon the type of soil and its uses. The soil of barren area should show different amount of radioactivity when compared with that of the cultivated soil. For the investigation of amount of radioactivity in the barren soil, an area of about 60 h of saline soil was selected in Rakh Dera Chal near the city of Lahore in the Punjab province of Pakistan. The technique of gamma ray spectrometry was applied using high purity germanium gamma-ray detector and a PC based MCA. Activity concentration levels due to K-40, Cs-137, Ra-226 and Th-232 were measured in 125 saline soil samples collected at a spacing of about 4 ha at the depth level of 0-25 cm with a step of 5 cm depth. Activity concentrations of the concerned radionuclides were as follows: K-40, 524.84-601.62 Bq kg(-1), Cs-137, not detected (less than the lower detection limit), Ra-226, 24.73-28.17 Bq kg(-1), and Th-232, 45.46-52.61 Bq kg(-1). Before the radiometric measurements, chemical analysis for concentration of Na, Ca and Mg was also carried out along with the measurement of electrical conductivity and Ph of soil samples.

The preparation of Marinelli beaker standards containing (ThO2)-Th-232 in a secular equilibrium with its daughter nuclides was studied. Standards were prepared by mixing of known amounts of solid ThO2 and various solids (e.g. CaCO3) to reach desired density (e.g. 1.1 g/cm(3) for CaCO3). Measurements of calibrated Marinelli standards with HPGe detector showed that the energy dependence of the efficiency is similar to that of a point source, i.e. an almost linear dependence of log efficiency vs. log energy in the 200-2000 keV range, however the parabolic correlation fits better. The validity of these standards was checked by comparison to three certified reference Marinelli standards containing radio-cesium, radio-potassium and Ra-226 in environmental samples. Quite good agreement was obtained between our standards and the published certified data. The limit of detection for the determination of radio-cesium by gamma-ray spectrometry under the prevailing experimental conditions is 0.07 Bq (1.9 pCi), for 1.0 kg of environmental samples.

This paper walks through a theoretical analysis technique whereby an assay calculation can be carried out via collimated spectroscopy. This is done using standard approximations of homogeneous sources, source matrices, perfect collimation and accurately known geometric material distributions. All solutions are given in closed form when appropriate approximating functions are used. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Measurements were carried during three different seasons (fall, winter and spring) in Soum area northwest of Jordan. The highest average radon concentrations indoor were measured during winter, while in fall and spring its values were almost equals. The average radon concentration was 144 Bq m(-3), which is below the indoor radon concentration action level recommended by ICRP. This indoor average is about three times the Jordanian national average which may be due to the geological settings of the study area that composed of carbonate sedimentary rocks bearing high radioactive material. The average radon concentration in soil air was about 15 kBq m(-3) and it ranges from 4 to 21 kBq m(-3) in winter and fall, respectively. Ignoring other sources of radon in the dwellings, every 1000 Bq m(-3) in the soil contributes about 10 Bq m(-3). The equilibrium factor was calculated to be 0.4. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A method has been developed in our laboratory by using modified Lucas cells connected to a radon source and tightly closed onto the top by the tested membranes whose radon diffusion coefficients are being measured. Solving the time-dependent differential equation for radon diffusion in the membrane for well-defined experimental conditions the effective radon diffusion coefficient of the insulating material can be evaluated by comparing the radon concentration decrease in the cell for the first hours with the well-known radioactive decay. First results obtained in several preliminary tests carried out with a parafilm M barrier and two polyethylene membranes are shown in this paper. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the absence of a fast test reactor in the United States, initial irradiation testing of candidate fuels can be performed in a thermal test reactor that has been modified to produce a test region with a hardened neutron spectrum. Such a test facility, with a spectrum similar but somewhat softer than that of the liquid-metal fast breeder reactor (LMFBR), has been constructed in the INEEL's Advanced Test Reactor (ATR). The radial fission power distribution of the actinide fuel pin, which is an important parameter in fission gas release modelling, needs to be accurately predicted and the hardened neutron spectrum in the ATR and the LMFBR fast neutron spectrum is compared. The comparison analyses in this study are performed using MCWO, a well-developed tool that couples the Monte Carlo transport code MCNP with the isotope depletion and build-up code ORIGEN-2. MCWO analysis yields time-dependent and neutronspectrum-dependent minor actinide and Pu concentrations and detailed radial fission power profile calculations for a typical fast reactor (LMFBR) neutron spectrum and the hardened neutron spectrum test region in the ATR. The MCWO-calculated results indicate that the cadmium basket used in the advanced fuel test assembly in the ATR can effectively depress the linear heat generation rate in the experimental fuels and harden the neutron spectrum in the test region.

A validated computational tool is needed for reliable dose rate calculations. In fusion reactors neutrons induce high levels of radioactivity and presumably high doses. The complex geometries of the devices require the use of sophisticated geometry modelling and computational tools for transport calculations. Simple rule of thumb laws do not always apply well. Two computational procedures have been developed recently and applied to fusion machines. Comparisons between the two methods showed some inherent discrepancies when applied to calculation for the ITER while good agreement was found for a 14 MeV point source neutron benchmark experiment. Further benchmarks were considered necessary to investigate in more detail the reasons for the different results in different cases. In this frame the application to the Joint European Torus JET machine has been considered as a useful benchmark exercise. In a first calculational benchmark with a representative D-T irradiation history of JET the two methods differed by no more than 25%. In another, more realistic benchmark exercise, which is the subject of this paper, the real irradiation history of D-T and D-D campaigns conducted at JET in 1997-98 were used to calculate the shut-down doses at different locations, irradiation and decay times. Experimental dose data recorded at JET for the same conditions offer the possibility to check the prediction capability of the calculations and thus show the applicability (and the constraints) of the procedures and data to the rather complex shutdown dose rate analysis of real fusion devices. Calculation results obtained by the two methods are reported below, comparison with experimental results give discrepancies ranging between 2 and 10. The reasons of that can be ascribed to the high uncertainty on the experimental data and the unsatisfactory JET model used in the calculation. A new dedicated JET benchmark experiment will be performed trying to solve these issues.

In particular, the concrete that has been used as a biological reactor shield and graphite that has been used as a moderator-reflector represent the majority of waste, requiring geological disposal. To reduce this undesirable volume to the minimum and to successfully plan the dismantling and disposal of radioactive materials to storage facilities, the activations of the structures should be accurately evaluated. In the framework of the decommissioning and the dismantling of the experimental reactor of the University of Strasbourg, detailed activation estimates have been conducted to characterise the graphite and the structural materials present in the reactor environment. For this purpose, the chemical compositions of fresh graphite samples and different types of concrete have been determined by activation analysis in the research reactors OSIRIS and ORPHEE of CEA Saclay (France). Then, the activations of graphite, concrete and other materials have been calculated in the whole reactor, as a function of the three main nuclear data libraries, i.e. ENDF, JEF and JENDL. In parallel, the activations of representative graphite and concrete samples have been measured experimentally. The comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental values validates the approach and the methodology used in the present study and tests the consistency and the reliability of the nuclear data used for activation analysis. We believe that a similar approach could also be used for the decommissioning of industrial nuclear reactors.

Thus, in addition to the normal reactor core complement of enriched uranium fuel assemblies, two other types are available on the world market. These are the ERU (enriched recycled uranium) and the MOX (mixed oxide) fuel assemblies. Framatome ANP produces ERU fuel assemblies by taking feed material from reprocessing facilities and blending this with highly enriched uranium from other sources. MOX fuel assemblies contain plutonium isotopes, thus exploiting the higher neutron yield of the plutonium fission process. This paper describes and evaluates the gamma, spontaneous and alpha reaction neutron source terms of these non-irradiated fuel assembly types by defining their nuclear characteristics. The dose rates which arise from these terms are provided along with an overview of radiation protection aspects for consideration in transporting and delivering such fuel assemblies to power generating utilities.

In this paper, a non-destructive approach combining gamma ray spectroscopy and Monte Carlo simulations is used in order to characterise massive concrete blocks containing some radioactive waste. The limits and uncertainties of the proposed method are quantified for the source term activity estimates using (CS)-C-137 as a tracer element. A series of activity measurements with a few representative waste containers were performed before and after destruction. It has been found that neither was the distribution of radioactive materials homogeneous nor was its density unique, and this became the major source of systematic errors in this study. Nevertheless, we conclude that by combining gamma ray spectroscopy and full scale Monte Carlo simulations one can estimate the source term activity for some tracer elements such as Cs-134, Cs-137, Co-60, etc. The uncertainty of this estimation should not be bigger than a factor of 2-3.

In this frame, high temperature reactors (HTRs) have, among others, the capability to burn actinides. After a short introduction on HTRs, the performances of two MC-based burnup codes (Monte Carlo continuous energy burnup and MONTEBURNS) in assessing the ability of these reactors to burn actinides are compared. These codes are necessary for performing ultra-high burnup calculations on HTRs. The best one, in this specific case, results to be MONTEBURNS. It was analysed using HTRs loaded with the following: (1) 1st generation Pu, 600 equivalent full power days; (2) 2nd generation Pu, 645 equivalent full power days; and (iii) 33% 1st generation Pu and 67% Th, 705 equivalent full power days. Finally, it is possible to conclude that HTRs can reduce time when the waste is considered dangerous. Even if the amount of reduction does not solve the whole problem, it represents an important step in the management of radioactive waste.

Existing neutron beam shutters can be replaced with concrete at low power or with concrete and steel at similar to 500 kW of beam power. Potential voids in the hot cell walls are analysed to determine the impact on dose rates as a function of void size. A change in the type of shielding work is noted as the project moved from the early design stages as a 'green field' site to the current stage as a construction project nearing completion, where issues to be addressed are approaching retrofit-type analyses.

Compared to the present GSI facility, a factor of 100 in primary beam intensities and up to a factor of 10,000 in secondary radioactive beam intensities are key technical goals of the proposal. The second branch of the so-called Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) is the production of antiprotons and their storage in rings and traps. The facility will provide beam energies a factor of similar to 15 higher than presently available at the GSI for all ions, from protons to uranium. The shielding design of the synchrotron SIS 1001300 is shown exemplarily by using Monte Carlo calculations with the FLUKA code. The experimental area serving the investigation of compressed baryonic matter is analysed in the same way. In addition, a dose comparison is made for an experimental area operated with medium energy heavy-ion beams. Here, Monte Carlo calculations are performed by using either heavy-ion primary particles or proton beams with intensifies scaled by the mass number of the corresponding heavy-ion beam.

These data, or the new models, which have been implemented into high-energy transport codes, can be now used to predict with a larger confidence or, at least with a known uncertainty, some important quantities for the design of spallation sources. In this paper, examples concerning the residue production in a Pb-Bi target and the high-energy neutrons escaping the target are presented. In the first case, the activity and the amount of radioactive volatile elements that can be released, in case of a containment failure, are calculated and the level of confidence of the calculation is assessed. The second example shows that the models correctly predict the high-energy tail of the neutron spectrum, which is important for radioprotection in the facility.

Such calculations may be required for planning radiation protection measures in the vicinity of radioactive sources or patients containing radionuclides, calibrations of radiation instruments or for estimating the absorbed dose rate to patients receiving brachytherapy. The factor relating activity and air kerma rate is called air kerma rate constant-Gamma(delta). In this paper, the results of recalculation of this quantity for unfiltered point sources of radionuclides in practice used most often are given. The calculations included corrections for internal conversion of X rays and gamma rays and detailed accounting of the generation of the K and L series X rays from internal conversion and electron capture. Particular air kerma rate constants were calculated for each discrete line in the photon spectrum of radionuclide with a yield per decay event > 0.01% and the energy > 20 keV. Since the energy structure of the photon spectra and accessible discrete numerical values of the mass energy-transfer coefficient for air are not the same, the cubic spline interpolation was used to obtained the coefficient, where the photon spectrum data are available. In the calculation, the latest gamma ray spectral data for all radionuclides and latest data for the mass energy-transfer coefficient for air are used. Air kerma rate constants for the following 35 radionuclides are calculated: C-11, N-13, O-15, F-18, Na-24, K-42, K-43, Cr-51, Fe-52, Fe-59, Co-57, Co-58, Co-60, Ga-67, Ga-68, Se-75, Mo-99, Tc-99m, In-111, In-113m, I-123, I-125, I-131, Xe-127, (133)xe, Cs-137, Eu-152, Eu-154, Tm-170, Ta-182, Ir-192, Hg-197, (198)AU, Tl-201 and Am-241.

The beam intensio, will be 1 puA (6 x 10(12) particles s(-1)) for any element at the goal. For the hands-on-maintenance and the rational shield thickness of the building, the beam loss must be controlled with several kinds of monitors. Three types of radiation monitors will be installed. The first one consists of a neutron dose equivalent monitor and an ionisation chamber, which are commercially available area monitors. The second one is a conventional hand-held dose equivalent monitor wherein the logarithmic signal is read by a programmable logic controller based on the radiation safety interlock system (HIS). The third one is a simple plastic scintillator called a beam loss monitor. All the monitors have threshold levels for alarm and beam stop, and HIS reads all these signals.

Seven different geometrical objects, representative of the configurations of natural uranium metal potentially encountered by workers at these facilities, are modelled to determine gamma ray and bremsstrahlung dose rates. The dose rates are calculated using the MCNP5 code and also by using the MICROSHIELD point-kernel code. Both gamma ray and bremsstrahlung dose rates are calculated and combined to obtain a total dose rate. The two methods were found to be in good agreement despite differences in modelling assumptions and method differences. Computed total dose rates on the surface of these objects ranged from similar to 51-84 mu Sv h(-1) and 17-95 mu Sv h(-1) using the MCNP5 and the MICROSHIELD modeling, respectively. The partitioning of the computed dose rates between gamma rays and bremsstrahlung were the same order of magnitude for each object.

The new version of PANDEMONIUM introduces time-dependent neutronics for source multiplication coupled with transient source and detector positions. The code is designed to provide quick and acceptably accurate total effective dose estimates for scenarios and facilities for which conventional methods prove to be too impractical or costly to model.

A DPF is a pulsed device in which deuterium nuclear fusion reactions can be obtained through the pinching effects of electromagnetic fields upon a dense plasma. The empirical scale law that governs the total D-D neutron yield from a single pulse of a DPF predicts for this machine a figure of similar to 10(7) fast neutrons per shot. The aim of the present work is to evaluate the role of backscattering of neutrons from the concrete walls surrounding the Montecuccolino DPF in total neutron yield measurements. The evaluation is performed by MCNP-5 simulations that are aimed at estimating the neutron spectra at a few points of interest in the laboratory, where neutron detectors will be placed during the experimental campaigns. Spectral information from the simulations is essential because the response of detectors is influenced by neutron energy. Comparisons are made with the simple r(-2) law, which holds for a DPF in infinite vacuum. The results from the simulations will ultimately be used both in the design and optimisation of the neutron detectors and in their final calibration and placement inside the laboratory.

Two future experimental areas are regarded to be the most decisive points concerning the activation of air. One is the area for the production of antiprotons. A second crucial experimental area is the so-called Super Fragment Separator. The production of radioactive isotopes in air is calculated using the residual nuclei option of the Monte Carlo program FLUKA. The results are compared with the data for the activation of air given by Sullivan and in IAEA report 283. The resulting effective dose is calculated using a program package from the German Federal Office for Radiation Protection, the Bundesamt fur Stranlenschutz. The results demonstrate that a direct emission of the total radioactivity produced into the air will probably conflict with the limits of the German Radiation Protection Ordinance. Special measures have to be planned in order to reduce the amount of radioactivity released into the air.

Usually the NORM concentrations of K-40, Th-232 and U-238 are measured by gamma-ray spectrometry using high-purity germanium or NaI(T1) detectors. K-40 is measured through its 1460.8 keV gamma line, which is mixed with 1459.2 keV line of Ac-228 from the chain of Th-232. This fact ignored till now, requires a correction in the computation of K-40 concentration. Although in many cases the error is < 1%, there are cases where there have been higher errors. It should be emphasised that even if the correction in K-40 concentration is large, the correction of the external dose index is negligible owing to the weighing factor being higher for Th-232 than for K-40 (by at least a factor of 10).

Thereby, circulating lymphocytes, which are in the Go stage of the cell cycle are stimulated with a mitogenic agent, usually phytohaemagglutinin, to replicate in vitro their DNA and enter cell division, and are then observed for abnormalities. Comparison with dose-response relationships obtained in vitro allows an estimate of exposure based on scoring: Unstable aberrations by the conventional, well-established analysis of metaphases for chromosome abnormalities or for micronuclei; So-called stable aberrations by the classical G-banding (Giemsa-Stain-banding) technique or by the more recently developed fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) method using fluorescent-labelled probes for centromeres and chromosomes. Three factors need to be considered in applying such biological dosimetry: (1) Radiation doses in the body are often inhomogeneous. A comparison of the distribution of the observed aberrations among cells with that expected from a normal poisson distribution can allow conclusions to be made with regard to the inhomogeneity of exposure by means of the so-called contaminated poisson distribution method; however, its application requires a sufficiently large number of aberrations, i.e. an exposure to a rather large dose at a high dose rate. (2) Exposure can occur at a low dose rate (e.g. from spread or lost radioactive sources) rendering a comparison with in vitro exposure hazardous. Dose-effect relationships of most aberrations that were scored, such as translocations, follow a square law. Repair intervening during exposure reduces the quadratic component with decreasing dose rate as exposure is spread over a longer period of time. No valid solution for this problem has yet been developed, although, in theory, both deterministic damage and aberrations might be repaired to a similar degree; a comparison of aberrations following a linear dose relationship might also help when the doses have been sufficiently large. (3) Investigations might have been possible only a certain time after the exposure. The relatively rapid disappearance of lymphocytes carrying unstable aberrations limits their use in retrospective dosimetry, years after exposure. Scoring stable aberrations, thought to persist in the circulating lymphocytes, might appear more appropriate in such situations. However, the examination of a representative number of cells by G-banding is extremely laborious, and the FISH method is not only expensive but has not yet been fully validated in different laboratories. In conclusion, biological dosimetry has serious limitations exactly for situations where the need for information is most urgent. It renders its most useful results when an individual has been exposed to a rather homogeneous high-level radiation over a short time interval, i.e. accidents at high-intensity radiation devices. On the other hand, it yielded less satisfactory information even when the most recent techniques were used for situations, where a low level, low dose rate exposure has occurred at some time in the past, for example for persons living in areas contaminated from the Chernobyl accident. Such negative experiences should be kept in mind in order to avoid futile and expensive investigations in the case of populations exposed from radioactivity and, notably, also from potentially clastogenic chemical agents.

Material activation in such facilities is an important aspect that has to be taken into account at an early stage in designing it. In particular, the choice of the target has consequences on the induced radioactivity and dose rates in the target station and its surroundings. In the present work, the radiological aspects of a stationary target made up of tantalum pellets are compared with those of a free-surface jet of mercury. An estimation of the hadronic inelastic interactions and the production of residual nuclei in the target, the two concentric magnetic horns, the decay tunnel, the surrounding rock and a downstream dump were performed for both targets using the Monte Carlo code FLUKA. The aim was to assess the dose-equivalent rate that is to be expected during maintenance work and to evaluate the amount of residual radioactivity, which will have to be disposed of after the facility has ceased operation. The problem of after-heat in the tantalum target and the consequences of raising the proton beam energy from 2.2 to 4 GeV were also investigated.

As similar to 30% of the LHC beam is lost in the cleaning insertions, these will become some of the most radioactive locations around the entire LHC ring. Thus, remanent dose rates to be expected during later repair or maintenance interventions must be considered in the design phase itself. As a consequence, the beam cleaning insertions form a unique test bed for a recently developed approach to calculate remanent dose rates. A set of simulations, different in complexity, is used in order to evaluate methods for the estimation of remanent dose rates. The scope, as well as the restrictions, of the omega-factor method are shown and compared with the explicit simulation approach. The latter is then used to calculate remanent dose rates in the beam cleaning insertions. Furthermore, a detailed example for maintenance dose planning is given.

This activation inside the ESRF 6 GeV storage ring is essentialiy due to photonuclear reactions. This paper describes the first results of Monte Carlo calculations that were started to prepare this zoning. The electron beam losses inside the storage ring, required to calculate saturation activities, are described. Results for the activation of the air inside the ring tunnel and of the cooling water are presented. The activation of accelerator components is illustrated with the results of the activation of the stainless steel vessels in a standard cell and in a cell with higher losses due to the presence of a vertical scraper. The amount of activation is compared with clearance levels given in the European directive 96/29/Euratom.

Analyses based on DORT models (in both R-Z and R-theta geometries) were used with representative plant operating history and core power distribution data in defining the expected neutron environment in regions near the reactor core. The activation analyses were performed by multiplying the DORT scalar fluxes by energy-dependent reaction cross sections (based on ENDF/B-VI data) to generate reaction rates on a per atom basis. The results from the ORIGEN2 computer code were also used for determining the activities associated with certain nuclides where multi-group cross section data were not available. In addition to the bulk material activation of equipment and structures near the reactor, the activated corrosion-product (or 'crud') deposits on system and equipment surfaces were considered. The projected activities associated with these sources were primarily based on plant data and experience from operating PWR plants.

Since the beam is not extracted from the ring, all the particles will eventually be lost somewhere in the machine and thus activate the accelerator components and the surrounding concrete and rock. In particular, as nuclei change their charge in beta-decay, a large part of the particles will be lost in the arcs of the decay ring and mainly irradiate the magnets. The density of inelastic interactions of hadrons in the magnets, concrete and rock and the track-length distribution of secondary hadrons were calculated by means of the FLUKA Monte Carlo code. These values were used to estimate the induced radioactivity in the facility, the dose rates expected in the decay ring and the consequences for the environment.

For performing detailed characterisations and dose optimisations of these workplaces, active extremity dosemeters can be used as complementary tools to passive hand monitoring. Active extremity dosimetry is still a subject of research. In this context, IRSN has started a research and development programme. As a first step, a hospital workplace study has been performed using thermoluminescence dosemeters and has shown, in agreement with previous works, that the pads of the fingers, points that are very difficult to instrument, receive the largest doses. Numerical studies have now started, with the aim of calculating the dose equivalent gradients through the hands, in order to optimise the locations of the detectors.

Irradiation experiments have been performed by using the 500 MeV Neutron Spallation Source Facility in KEK. The large concrete assembly was placed in the direction of 0 degrees to the beamline. Two kinds of samples were placed at several positions in the assembly. The irradiation period was about I week and induced activities in the samples were measured until similar to 1.5 y after irradiation. From the comparison between the experiment and the available Monte Carlo calculation code system, good agreement was obtained for Na-24, (SC)-S-47, Ca-47 and Mn-54 within a factor 2; however, large discrepancies were observed for some other nuclides.

Three sets of 17 Bi samples (1/2 inch in diameter and 1 mm thick) were placed in 3 Pb disc-shaped holders inside the target at 5, 10 and 15 cm from its front. After irradiation with 660 MeV proton beam gamma-spectra of radioisotopes produced in Bi were collected several times for each sample with the use of HPGe detectors in order to identify the radioisotopes and to determine their absolute activities. Their spatial distributions were then compared with respective values obtained in the calculations made with the use of FLUKA and/or MCNPX code. A fair agreement with the experiment has been observed.

J	Marsh, JW; Bailey, MR; Birchall, A				Marsh, JW; Bailey, MR; Birchall, A			A step-by-step procedure to aid the assessment of intake and doses from measurement data	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							INTERNAL DOSIMETRY; BIOASSAY DATA; PLUTONIUM	The interpretation of bioassay data to assess intakes and doses depends not only on the biokinetic model used but also on the choice of parameter values made by the assessor. Therefore, it is understandable that different assessors will draw different conclusions from the same datasets; even if the same models are used. A systematic step-by-step procedure is proposed for the assessment of cases with comprehensive data in which the time of intake is known. The aims are to promote harmonisation of dose assessments and to assist in obtaining the best available assessment of intake and dose from the monitoring data. The procedure is illustrated by means of an example reported recently in the literature. The case which involves a 6 y follow-up of a subject who inhaled Am-241, is somewhat unusual in that there are comprehensive in vivo measurements, but few excretion data. The rate at which activity is absorbed from lungs to blood can be one of the largest sources of uncertainty in any inhalation assessment, and significantly improved fits to the measurement data were obtained by choosing appropriate values for the relevant parameters. 'The best estimate' of the resulting effective dose in this case was higher by a factor of -2 or 3, respectively, than those obtained assuming ICRP default values for Type M or Type S.

Approximately 60% of 90Y-chloride at a puncture wound was absorbed into the body of rats over 72 h post-puncture and radioactivity in femoral bone increased during the timed-release of Y-90. Intravenous administration of CaNa3DTPA (systemic treatment) at 15 min post-puncture reduced 90Y at a puncture wound and in bone up to 75.6 and 84.3% of controls, respectively. Direct infiltration of CaNa(3)DTPA into a puncture wound site (local treatment) at 15 min post-puncture diminished radioactivity at the puncture wound and in bone up to 34.9 and 52.5% of controls, respectively. Thus, prompt local treatment may be effective for removing Y-90 from a puncture wound and minimising Y-90-distribution to bone compared with systemic treatment.

The Mustonen method of calculating gamma-ray annual exposure rate from the radioactivity concentrations (Bq kg(-1)) of Ra-126, Th-232 and K-40 in the blocks have been adopted with modifications to suit the Nigerian situation. The specific absorbed dose rates obtained were as follows: 11.36, 14.94 and 0.92 mu Gy y(-1) per Bq kg(-1) for Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40, respectively. These dose rates were used to calculate the annual effective dose in the model dwelling. The annual effective dose obtained varied between 209.20 (Osogbo) and 400.36 mu Sv y(-1) (Abeokuta). The values are in the range of values obtained for the German Democratic Republic (309 mu Sv y(-1)) and Jordan (470 mu Sv y(-1)).

The activity concentrations in the samples were found to be somewhat higher than in other countries. An effort has been made to assess the radiation hazard associated with these materials by determining the gamma activity concentration index L It was found that the value of I for all the samples was <= 2, which indicates that the gamma dose contribution was not more than 0.3 mSv y(-1). The samples considered were safe for use in the construction of urban dwellings in Bangladesh and do not pose any significant source of radiation hazard.
