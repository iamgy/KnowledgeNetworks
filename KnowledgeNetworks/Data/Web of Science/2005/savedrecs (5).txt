J	Steinhausler, F				Steinhausler, F			Chernobyl and Goiania lessons for responding to radiological terrorism	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	40th Annual Meeting of the National-Council-on-Radiation-Protection-and-Measurements	APR 14-15, 2004	Arlington, VA	Natl Council Radiat Protect & Measurements		National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements; terrorism; accident analysis; waste management		The deployment of a radiological dispersal device (RDD) is likely to result in relatively low radiation exposure of the targeted population, insufficient to cause a severe radiation detriment. Nevertheless, due to atmospheric dispersion of the radioactive material, an urban area equaling several city blocks could be affected. The current knowledge base concerning the response to radiological terrorism, focusing mainly on environmental cleanup and site recovery (CSR) of areas with radioactive contamination due to the deployment of an RDD, is largely derived from military scientific tests or exercises assembled over the past 50 y with only limited applicability to the consequences of an RDD detonating in a city. This paper focuses on the extensive experience in CSR gained in the management of the radiological accident contaminating the Brazilian city of Goiania in 1987, and managing the aftermath of the Chernobyl reactor accident in 1986. The incident in Goiania demonstrated the numerous practical difficulties of implementing a sound CSR, based on a balanced judgment of all relevant factors, such as radiation safety, environmental issues, economic consequences, and public fear. A review of the different stages of the intervention policy in the former Soviet Union reveals that risk-benefit cost analysis was not used for the decision-making process during the later stages of the post-accident situation. Instead, a CSR policy was adopted that resulted in continuously escalating costs. The results of this analysis are used to develop an Integrated Cleanup and Site Restoration Concept and recommend practically applicable solutions from Lessons Learned.

J	Conklin, WC				Conklin, WC			Proposed framework for cleanup and site restoration following a terrorist incident involving radioactive material	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	40th Annual Meeting of the National-Council-on-Radiation-Protection-and-Measurements	APR 14-15, 2004	Arlington, VA	Natl Council Radiat Protect & Measurements		National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements; radioactivity, removal of; terrorism; decontamination		Cleanup following a terrorism incident involving a radiological dispersal device (RDD) or improvised nuclear device (IND) is likely to be technically challenging, costly, and politically charged. Lessons learned from the Top Officials 2 exercise and the increased threat of terrorist use of an RDD or IND have driven federal officials to push for an agreed-upon process for determining appropriate cleanup levels. State and local authorities generally have the ultimate responsibility for final public health decisions in their jurisdictions. In response to terrorist attacks, local authorities are likely to request federal assistance in assessing the risk and establishing appropriate cleanup levels. It is realistic to expect local and state requests for significant federal assistance in planning and implementing recovery operations. State and local authorities may desire "shared accountability" with the federal government in setting the appropriate cleanup levels. Government officials at all levels will face pressure to say how clean is clean enough and how quickly people can re-enter affected areas. Issues arising include (1) the nature of the relationship between the federal, state, and local leadership involved in the recovery efforts and (2) where the funding for recovery comes from. Many agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) have long been involved in cleanup activities involving radioactive materials. These agencies have recognized the need for a participatory process and realize the need to remain flexible when faced with possible unprecedented environmental challenges following a terrorist attack. Currently, the Department of Homeland Security has a committee process underway, with participation of the EPA, NRC, DOE, and other federal agencies, to try to resolve these issues and to begin engaging state, local, and tribal governments, and others as appropriate.

J	Till, JE; McBaugh, D				Till, JE; McBaugh, D			Practical and scientifically based approaches for cleanup and site restoration	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	40th Annual Meeting of the National-Council-on-Radiation-Protection-and-Measurements	APR 14-15, 2004	Arlington, VA	Natl Council Radiat Protect & Measurements		National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements; radioactivity, removal of; emergency planning; decontamination		This paper presents practical and scientific approaches for cleanup and site restoration following terrorist events. Both approaches are required in actual emergency situations and are complementary. The practical examples are taken from the May 2003 second biannual national emergency exercise, Top Officials 2 (TOPOFF 2), which occurred in Chicago, Illinois, and Seattle, Washington. The scientific examples are taken from the Department of Energy sites at Rocky Flats, Fernald, and Los Alamos where cleanup initiatives based on scientific approaches and community input are underway. Three examples are provided to explain, from a practical standpoint, how decisions during the exercise had to be made quickly, even though the alternatives were not always clear. These examples illustrate how scientific approaches can be integrated into the resolution of these dilemmas. The examples are (1) use of water to wash city roads and freeways contaniinated with plutonium, Am-241, and Cs-137; (2) decontamination of large public ferries that passed through a radioactive plume; and (3) handling of wastewater following decontamination within a city. Each of these situations posed the need for an immediate decision by authorities in charge, without the benefit of community input or time for an analysis of the important pathways of exposure. It is evident there is a need to merge the practical knowledge gained in emergency response with scientific knowledge learned from cleanup and site restoration. The development of some basic scientific approaches ahead of time in the form of easy-to-use tools will allow practical decisions to be made more quickly and effectively should an actual terrorist event occur.

These waste materials are managed in a way to keep the human health and the environment free of radiation associated hazards. The prime practice has been of shallow ground or near-surface disposal type. Different measures and operational procedures at the institute, in step with the international norms for the management of low and intermediate level waste, have been adopted. To ensure the safe disposal practices and radiation safety of the workers and of the general public, radiological safety related routines are practiced with due concern. Some safety aspects of the prevailing practices are discussed in this presentation.

The instrument, the Ortec Detective, becomes a fully functional spectroscopy system when connected to a laptop computer. In this configuration it can be used as a high-resolution portable whole body counter. This work has determined that the instrument has adequate sensitivity for emergency response with respect to fission and activation products, but not actinides. The use of Monte Carlo simulations has allowed the HML to calibrate the instrument, partially optimize the counting geometry and develop a calibration curve that is a function of photon energy and a persons' size. Similarly for thyroid counting, a function has been found that fits counting efficiency to a person's height. The MDA's are a few kilo Becquerels for fission and activation products for a 5-min count in an unshielded environment using a male subject.

J	Moore, JA; Kearfott, KJ				Moore, JA; Kearfott, KJ			A simple radon chamber for educational use	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topic; radon; education; health physics; radon progeny	EQUILIBRIUM FACTOR; CHARCOAL DETECTORS; CALIBRATION; PROGENY	Radon chambers are typically able to maintain a constant, known concentration of radon by pumping a constant activity concentration of radon gas into the chamber. A radon chamber has been designed by placing a radon source inside the chamber volume and allowing radon to build up inside the chamber. Because the radon concentration is not constant, calculations have been made to determine e integrated equivalent constant radon concentration in MBqh(-1)m(-3) for up to 4 d. The chamber, made by placing a radium dial inside an incubator, has interior dimensions of 87.6 cm x 55.9 cm x 51.4 cm for a total volume of 0.25 m(3). The chamber can produce an integrated equivalent constant radon activity concentration level of 0.013 MBqh(-1) m(-3) over the initial 24 h, 0.043 MBq h(-1) m(-3) over the initial 48 h, 0.078 MBq h(-1) m(-3) over the initial 72 h, and 0.118 MBq h(-1) m(-3) over the initial 96 h. The chamber can also demonstrate, for educational purposes, the kinetics of the build-up of a radioactive gas in an enclosed environment as well as the kinetics of washout and leakage.

J	Patlovich, S; Emery, RJ; Whitehead, LW				Patlovich, S; Emery, RJ; Whitehead, LW			Characterization and geographic location of sources of radioactivity lost downhole in the course of oil and gas exploration and production activities in Texas, 1956 to 2001	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						occupational topic; Am-241; Cs-137; environmental impact	INCIDENTS	Case reports describing sources of radioactivity lost downhole in Texas from 1956 to 2001 were obtained from the Texas Department of Health Bureau of Radiation Control and entered into a computerized database. The events of the 45-y period of analysis were characterized, examining aspects such as source type, amount of activity location of loss, depth, and date of occurrence. Results of the study found that 316 downhole source incidents were reported to the agency during this period of time, representing a total of 426 distinct sources of radioactivity lost downhole within the boundaries of the State of Texas. The sources lost were predominantly (AmBe)-Am-241, accounting for 74 TBq of radioactivity at the time of loss, and Cs-137, accounting for 16.3 TBq of radioactivity. A longitudinal analysis of the data showed the average loss per active oil and gas rig in Texas (known as "rig count") at approximately 24 losses per 1,000 rigs. Specific geographic information was largely missing from many or tire records, which prevented the geolocation or wells described to contain lost radioactive sources. As a result, most wells could only be located to the county level, and no comprehensive geographical information system (GIS) map could be accurately created from the data. However, when available, source location information was standardized to permit the characterization of the sources reported as lost. This effort produced the first dedicated compendium of lost downhole sources for the State of Texas and provides an important source or information for regulatory agencies. The ability to provide prompt information about the fate and location of sources of radioactivity is important to regulatory officials, given tire recent concerns about radiation source inventory control in the post 9/11 world as it relates to the possible creation of radiological dispersal devices.

Designed to be user-friendly, easily searchable, and readily up-dateable, the Catalog is being filled, after some initial priming, mainly through on-line submissions of proposed references by the Catalog users themselves. The relevant information on a proposed reference is submitted to ISCORS in a simple, standardized formal; it is vetted (with acceptance criteria such as publication in a peer-reviewed technical journal, or appearance in a formally-issued federal agency report) and then added semi-automatically to the Catalog. Built around a relational database, the system offers subject- and text-search capabilities, provides information on parameter definitions and methods of measurement, on transport/exposure pathways, and on standard models and codes. The Catalog is intended for use by (and being populated by) the professionals, managers, and others involved or interested in the application of pathway modeling to estimate doses and risks associated with sites contaminated with radioactive or other hazardous materials.

H-2, O-2 and ClO3- are formed as long-lived products and reach equilibrium concentrations at a gas partial pressure of some 10 bar. Since formation of a gas phase is completely suppressed, H-2 and O-2 are kept dissolved. The equilibrium concentration level depends on dose rate and pH. Experiments at 90 degrees C and with added H-2 show no gas production at all. From the kinetic simulation of the experiments we deduce that the reaction of OH and Cl-2(-) radicals with H-2 limits or inhibits sustaining solution decomposition. If species are present which compete with the radicals for H-2, (such as Br-) the decomposition is promoted. In such a case the gas partial pressure exceeds 100 bar. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Dissolution rates increased less than 10-fold for an almost 100-fold increase in doping level and fall within the range of predictions of the Mixed Potential Model (a detailed mechanistic model for used fuel dissolution). Dissolution rates were lower in carbonate-free solutions and enrichment of (238)pu on the UO2 surface was Suggested in carbonate solutions. Effective G values, defined as the ratio of the total amount of U dissolved divided by the maximum possible amount of U dissolved by radiolytically produced H2O2, increased with decreasing doping levels. This suggests that the dissolution reaction at high dose rates is limited by the reaction rate between UO2 and H2O2, but becomes increasingly limited by the rate of production of H2O2 at lower dose rates.

A combination of corrosion potential (E-CORR) measurements and cyclic voltammetry have indicated that dissolved hydrogen can polarize the UO2 surface to reducing potentials; i.e., to E-CORR values more negative then those observed tinder anoxic (argon-purged) conditions. A comparison of the behaviours of SIMFUEL specimens with and without incorporated noble metal F-particles indicates that these particles may act as catalytic electrodes for H-2 oxidation, H-2 <-> 2e(-) + 2H(+). It is the galvanic coupling of these particles to the UO2 matrix which suppresses the fuel corrosion potential. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To quantify to what extent the hydrogen overpressure may counteract radiolysis enhanced matrix dissolution, related experimental work has been performed. High burnup spent fuel was corroded in 5.6 mol (kg H2O)(-1) NaCl solution applying H-2 overpressures (experimental set 1) <0.17 bar by radiolysis, (experimental set 2) 2.8 bar by Fe corrosion, (experimental set 3) 3.2 bar by external H-2 gas. In the absence of Fe (experimental set 3) the UO2 matrix dissolution rate decreased by a factor of about 10. In this test the concentrations of U, Np, Tc in solution were found to be decreasing by at least two orders of magnitude, and ranging within the same level as in the presence of Fe powder (experimental set 2). However, Pu and Am concentrations (experimental set 3) were less affected, due to the high sorption capacity for these radioelements onto Fe corrosion products. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

After long time U concentrations will become depleted at the solids surface and it will be expected that U release rates will become controlled by the release rates of thorium (rates at neutral pH < 10(-6) g m(-2) d(-1)). Under reducing conditions, the matrix of HTR fuel particles presents significant intrinsic radionuclide confinement properties. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Calibration against UO2 dynamic leaching experiments	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Spent Fuel Workshop	APR 19-20, 2004	Lake Forest, IL				WASTE-DISPOSAL CONDITIONS; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; DECOMPOSITION; CORROSION; KINETICS; PH	Calibration and testing are inherent aspects of any modelling exercise and consequently they are key issues in developing a model for the oxidative dissolution of spent fuel. In the present work we present the outcome of the calibration process for the kinetic constants of a UO2 oxidative dissolution mechanism developed for using in a radiolytic model. Experimental data obtained in dynamic leaching experiments of unirradiated UO2 has been used for this purpose. The iterative calibration process has provided some insight into the detailed mechanism taking place in the alteration of UO2, particularly the role of OH radicals and their interaction with the carbonate system. The results show that, although more simulations are needed for testing in different experimental systems, the calibrated oxidative dissolution mechanism could be included in radiolytic models to gain confidence in the prediction of the long-term alteration rate of the spent fuel under repository conditions.

These simplified models calculate the effects of alpha particles and recoil atoms on mobility of uranium atoms in UO2. They lead to a diffusion coefficient which is proportional to the volume alpha activity with a proportionality factor of about 10(-44) (m(5)). However, the same models applied for fission lead to a radiation-enhanced diffusion coefficient which is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than values reported in literature for U and Pit. Other models are based on an extrapolation of radiation-enhanced diffusion measured either in reactors or under heavy ion bombardment. These models lead to a proportionality factor between the alpha self-irradiation enhanced diffusion coefficient and the volume alpha activity of 2 x 10(-41) (m(5)). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Part I: Assessment of the instant release fraction	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Spent Fuel Workshop	APR 19-20, 2004	Lake Forest, IL					A source-term model for the short-term release of radionuclides from spent nuclear fuel (SNF) has been developed. It provides quantitative estimates of the fraction of various radionuclides that are expected to be released rapidly (the instant release fraction, or IRF) when water contacts the UO2 or MOX fuel after container breaching in a geological repository. The estimates are based on correlation of leaching data for radionuclides with fuel burnup and fission gas release. Extrapolation of the data to higher fuel burnup values is based on examination of data on fuel restructuring, such as rim development, and oil fission gas release data, which permits bounding IRF values to be estimated assuming that radionuclide releases will be less than fission gas release. The consideration of long-term solid-state changes influencing the IRF prior to canister breaching is addressed by evaluating alpha self-irradiation enhanced diffusion, which may gradually increase the accumulation of fission products at grain boundaries.

This model takes into account most of the scientific results currently available except the effect of hydrogen and the current knowledge of the uncertainties. IRF was assessed by considering the evolution with time of the RN inventories located within the fuel microstructure to which no confinement properties can be allocated over the long term (gap, rim, grain boundaries). This allows for bounding values for the IRF as a function of time of canister breach and burnup. The matrix radiolytic dissolution was modeled by a simple kinetic model neglecting the recombination of radiolytic species and the influence of aqueous ligands. The oxidation of the UO2 matrix was assumed not to be kinetically controlled. Spent fuel performance was therefore demonstrated to mainly depend on the reactive surface area. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The amount of HNO2 was found to increase by a factor of 40 upon ultrasound irradiation, and the concentration of HNO2 reached the steady-state after long time irradiation. Although the concentration of HNO3 was low, the rate of generation of HNO2 in the organic solution was higher than that in aqueous solution equilibrated with the organic solution. The formation rates of HNO2 were greatly enhanced with an increase in concentration of HNO3 in the organic solution. The concentration of HNO2 was higher in the absence of a gas phase, because the HNO2 was transferred from the solution into the gas phase as a form of NOx. In the presence of a gas phase, a higher concentration of HNO2 was obtained at a lower temperature, due to the higher solubility of NOx in the solution.

Samples were obtained from an area of organic soil located on the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard (79 degrees N) and from a non-organic control site in the same region. Samples were differentiated into organic layers and the underlying material and measured for a suite of anthropogenic and natural radionuclides and for a variety of soil chemistry parameters. Results indicated that the organic components of the soil constitute a sink term for a number of radionuclides. Values for Pu isotopes, Cs-137 and U-238 were appreciably higher at the study site than at the control site, by up to a factor of 40 for Pu and 20 for Cs-137 and U-238. The source of U-238 to the site appears to be enrichment of this isotope from surface or melt water via adsorption to to either iron hydroxides or organic matter although the situation pertaining to pu and Cs-137 remains less clear.

A total number of 138 bacterial strains were gown on agar media containing I-125, and the strains having strong radioactivity were chosen by autoradiography. They were then grown in liquid media containing I-125, and the radioactivity of the cells and the supernatants was determined after centrifugation through silicone oil. Eight strains were found to remove 78 to 90% of iodine from the media within 24 hours, and corresponding amount of iodine was detected in their cells. The advantage of this method is in its simplicity and the low detection limit.

Particular attention was devoted to the exact determination of two uranium isotopes: U-235 and U-238 in order to find any presence of depleted uranium dispersed during the 1991 Gulf War. The calculated U-238/U-235 activity ratios for all the surface (15 cm) as well as the core profile (up to 70 cm in depth) samples were within the limit of one standard deviation, close to the value of 21.5 for natural uranium. Simultaneous instrumental determination of the unsupported Pb-210 and Ra-226 in a few sediment core profiles was used for quantification of sediment accumulation rates. The calculated sedimentation rates (for the constant atmospheric Pb-210 flux rate - CRS model) ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 cm . gamma(-1) and were close to the data calculated by the Weibull distribution of Cs-137 in undisturbed sediment cores.

Commercially available monoclonal antibodies from various commercial sources were screened. Identified "detection" antibody was radiolabeled with 125 1 and the selected "capture" antibody was chemically coupled to magnetizable cellulose to form a solid phase. In the procedure developed, standard/sample, radiolabeled antibody and capture antibody were incubated together for 3 hours at room temperature with shaking. After incubation, the bound complex was quantitated for the associated radioactivity. The analytical sensitivity observed was 1.0 mIU/ml with a wide concentration range up to 1000 mIU/ml of hCG. "High dose hook" of the developed assay was observed beyond 2000 mIU/ml. Results showed that the developed assay had a good precision: intra-assay CV less than 8%, inter-assay CV less than 10% and good analytical recovery of 97-109%. The clinical samples analyzed by the developed procedure showed a good correlation with that of the commercial kit (r = 0.92; y = 0.99x+0.5 1).

The kinetic curves were determined and the kinetic data were evaluated by forms of first-rate kinetic equations with different terms, generally used for adsorption of ions of low concentration. The adsorption process was reduced to two steps. Film diffusion and participle diffusion were found in the case of five samples. Gel diffusion, film diffusion and participle diffusion were found in the case of the other two samples. The presence of significant amount of cristobalite can explain the gel phase in these two samples. The rate coefficients of steps were calculated from the kinetic curves.

After digestion of the aged targets with their aluminum wrapper in 2M NaOH solution, nitric acid was added to complete dissolution of the formed residue. The prepared fission product solution was separated from 1291 and 91.8% Ru-106 by sequential distillation from 20% and 40% HNO3 solutions containing H2O2 and KMnO4, as oxidants, and by boiling for 4 and 2.5 hours, respectively. The recovery yield of Ru-106 collected in 0.1 M NaOH solution was similar to 68.2% with a radionuclidic purity of >= 99.99%. Thereafter, the fission product solution was brought to pH 9.5 by addition of NaOH solution to precipitate AI(OH)(3), MnO2, and Na2U2O7 which selectively retained the remaining fission products leaving, mainly, Cs-137 in the supernatant solution. The recovery yield of Cs-137 was >= 97.3% with similar to 99.75% radionuclidic purity. The gamma-ray emitter contaminants which could be detected and identified in the recovered Cs-137 solution, were similar to 0.25% Cs-134 and similar to 1.4- 10(-3)% (152,155) Eu.

The pretreatment of the samples was performed in the laboratory using IAEA recommended methods. The analysis of gamma-emitters such as K-40, Ra-226, Th-232 and (CS)-C-137 was performed with a high purity germanium detector (HPGe). For the determination of Sr-90, a liquid scintillation counting system was used. The average specific activities of K-40, Ra-226, Th-232 and Cs-137 have been found to be 307 +/- 101 Bq-kg(-1), 10.2 +/- 3 Bq.kg(-1), 24 +/- 6 Bq.kg(-1) and 2.8 +/- 1.3 Bq.kg(-1), respectively, in soil samples. Vegetation samples have smaller values of specific activities and even the analysis of water samples showed values less than LLD for earlier reported radionuclides. Other parameters like hazard indices, radium equivalent activities, absorbed dose rates and effective dose equivalents have also been determined. All these parameters have values less than their respective limiting values representing that the surveyed areas have no significant hazard from health point of view.

It was found that the sorption rate of Th(IV) was relatively slow, the sorption percent was abruptly increased from pH 2 to 4, and the sorption was decreased with increasing ionic strength as a whole. In the concentration range of Th(IV) from trace concentration to 1.4.10(-4) mol/l and in the absence of phosphate, the sorption isotherms were roughly fitted the Freundlich equation at different ionic strengths and approximately constant pH. These sorption characteristics of Th(IV) onto TiO2 Were compared with those of uranyl on the same sorbent. In addition, the positive effect of phosphate on the sorption of Th(IV) onto TiO2 was demonstrated obviously and can be attributed to strong surface binding of phosphate, and the subsequent formation of ternary surface complexes of Th(TV). The difference between the sorption characteristics of Th(IV) ions and uranyl ions onto TiO2 is discussed.

J	Rajput, MU; Ahmad, S; Ahmad, M; Ahmad, W				Rajput, MU; Ahmad, S; Ahmad, M; Ahmad, W			Determination of elemental composition of atmospheric aerosol in the urban area of Islamabad, Pakistan	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							NEUTRON-ACTIVATION ANALYSIS; BUDAPEST	This study provides useful information about the level and chemical composition of particulate matter and about the possible sources of the aerosol pollutant in Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan. Atmospheric aerosol samples were collected during winter (January and February) 1995, from two locations of Islamabad, namely of Sector F-7 and Sector I-9. Twenty-four elements were detected by using thermal neutron activation analysis (NAA) and atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). The concentration of total suspended particulates (TSP) in the area around the industrial sector (I-9) was found to be more than twice higher (297 mu g/m(3)) than in the Sector F-7 (133 mu g/m(3)). The enrichment factor analysis revealed Zn, As, Br, Sb, I and Pb, originated mainly from anthropogenic sources. The elemental ratio analysis indicated that both Sectors I-9 and F-7 are under the influence of coal burning processes whereas transportation is responsible for the toxic pollutants Ph and Br. The present results were discussed and compared with those of the literature. The results may also serve as base line level as this work employed samples collected in 1995 and many of the air environmental change factors occurred after the sampling year.

The effects of the concentrations of extractant, nitric acid, sodium nitrate and sodium oxalate on the distribution ratios of uranium(VI) have been studied. The values of enthalpy change for the extraction reactions with BDSO, TBP and a mixture of TBP and BDSO in toluene were -23.2 +/- 0.8 U/mol, -29.2 +/- 1.4 U/mol and -30.6 +/- 0.6 U/mol, respectively. It has been found that the maximum synergistic extraction effect occurs when the molar ratio of TBP to BDSO is close to 1. The composition of the complex of the synergistic extraction is UO2(NO3)(2) .BDSO-TBP.

In a 25-year survey including more than two hundreds of different materials were investigated. Of the materials normally used in the building industry, i.e., red clay bricks, cement of Portland Types I and II, concretes, gravels and sand, contain regular levels of the primordial radionuclides. The adsorbed dose rate in indoor air, in general, does not exceed the dose criterion of 80 nGy.h(-1) or 0.3 mSv.y(-1) for the effective dose. Granites and phosphogypsum are the highly radioactive materials for which the absorbed dose rate in indoor air becomes up to five times higher than the dose criterion. It is recommended to avoid the use of those materials without radioactivity control.

Recently national and EU regulations replaced the previous drinking water norms with the aim to strengthen consumers security concerning drinking water quality. Perugia and Urbino Universities carried out a joint study on the radiological characterization of the water destined for human consumption in the Umbria region. The aim of this work was to produce a map of the radon and tritium concentrations in the water of this area as a basis for the implementation of hydrogeological knowledge and to determine a possible related radiological risk for the local population. Rn-222 measurements were performed by liquid scintillation and gamma-spectrometry and H-3 measurements by liquid scintillation. Up to now, the Rn-222 concentrations ranged 5.9-65.79 Bq/l and H-3 concentrations are always lower than the detection limit (8.6 Bq/l).

For this purpose, an adequately sensitive analytical method was developed and standardized, employing radiochemical neutron activation analysis (RNAA). The method was applied to measure pg levels of Th in urine samples from which its daily urinary excretion was quantified. It was possible to achieve a limit of detection (LOD) of 10 pg Th (0.04 mu Bq) in urine samples. The daily urinary excretion of Th was measured in a group of 15 adult German subjects who were not occupationally exposed to Th. The daily urinary excretion ranged between 0.49-3.65 ng.d(-1), with the geometric mean of 1.29 ng Th.d(-1). This daily urinary excretion of Th provides an important baseline data against which the occupational exposure of workers could be assessed.

J	Czarwinski, R; Weiss, W				Czarwinski, R; Weiss, W			Safety and security of radioactive sources - international provisions	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article								For more than 50 years radioactive sources are used beneficially world-wide in medicine, industry, research and teaching. In the early 50ies mainly Ra-226 sources were used especially for medical applications. In the mean time a great number of radio-nuclides with more or less risk to individuals, society and environment are used. The number of these sources is increasing. The available experience with the application of sealed sources in industry, medicine, research and teaching shows that despite the widespread use of such sources a high level of safety can be achieved. One precondition is that the regulatory control of a radioactive source has to be carried out consistently during the life cycle of the sources - "from cradle to grave". Particular attention has to be given to the so-called orphan sources which are not subject to regulatory control, either because they have never been under control, or because they have been lost, misplaced, abandoned, stolen or transferred without proper authorisation. The concern about orphan sources arising from poor safety and security standards of radioactive material around the world resulted in intensive global actions especially in the light of the security situation after the 11th September 2001. The improvement of regulatory control is one of the key elements in preventing people, goods and environment from being exposed exceptionally by the misuse of radioactive sources. Important steps toward the improvement of the safety and security of high radioactive sources are the IAEA Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and the European Directive on the Control.

The new cross-sections were compared to literature data. The optimum energy range for production of Cu-64 was found to be 70 -> 35 MeV on Zn-66 and 37 -> 20 MeV on Zn-68. The thick-target yields were determined as 777 MBq/mu Ah (21.0 mCi/mu Ah) and 185 NtBq/mu Ah (5.0 mCi/mu Ah), respectively. The yields of the longer-lived contaminant copper radioisotopes (i.e. Cu-61 when using Zn-66 as target material and both Cu-61 and Cu-67 in the case of Zn-68 target material) were also calculated. The results obtained from the present study indicate that both reactions are suited for the production of Cu-64 at a medium energy cyclotron.

The experiments under irradiation are performed at the Institut Laue Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble using the Lohengrin spectrometer. A thin (UO2)-U-235 layer in direct contact with an oxidised zirconium foil is irradiated in the ILL high flux reactor. The fission product flux is about 10(11) ions cm(-2) s(-1) and the target temperature is measured by an IR pyrometer. A model is proposed to deduce an apparent uranium diffusion coefficient in zirconia from the energy distribution broadening of two selected fission products. It is found to be equal to 10(-15) cm(2) s(-1) at 480 degrees C and compared to uranium thermal diffusion data in ZrO2 in the same pressure and temperature conditions. The FED results are analysed in comparison with literature data. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The numerous constraints related to the operation in a facility classed as 'nuclear' have been taken into account during the design of the source. In this paper, however, we have concentrated in particular on (i) the radiation hardness of the magnetic structure, (ii) the injection of the RF power, (iii) the ionisation efficiency for noble gases, (iv) the ability of the source to work despite major outgassing and (v) the beam emittance. The first version of this source was tested to validate its principle by measurements of its performance. The results obtained with He, Ne and Ar permit us to predict ionisation efficiencies for Kr and Xe of the order of 80%, even with outgassing flows of the order of 1.2 x 10(16) particle s(-1). Under the same working conditions, between 60% and 80% of the beam current is included within an emittance of 30 pi mm mrad at 20 kV, which could still be improved. Using the results obtained with the first version of the source, a second version respecting all the SPIRAL II constraints has now been designed and is under construction. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Xu, ZW; Kazimi, MS; Driscoll, MJ				Xu, ZW; Kazimi, MS; Driscoll, MJ			Impact of high burnup on PWR spent fuel characteristics	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article								Reducing the burden of management of spent nuclear fuel is important to the future of nuclear energy. The impact of higher pressurized water reactor (PWR)fuel burnup is examined in this paper from the perspective of its impact on spent-fuel radioactivity, decay heat, and plutonium content. The necessary fresh fuel enrichments to achieve high burnup in PWRs with the same three-batch operation scheme are first computed; then, characteristics of the spent fuel are determined The increase in decay heat with burnup is found to be generally less than linear. Although each high-burnup fuel assembly would be hotter and more radioactive, the total decay heat to be removed or accommodated in storage is less for the same electricity production. If the time window before 150 yr after discharge can be excluded from impacting a repository, significant savings in its capacity can be realized with high-burnup fuel. The high-burnup fuel is more proliferation resistant because of reduced total plutonium production per kilowatt hour and because of higher content of less desirable plutonium isotopes, such as Pu-238. The fuel cycle cost can be slightly reduced by increasing burnup until it reaches a shallow minimum near 70 Mwd/kg. Higher burnups would require one-time changes to the limits on enrichments that can be handled in most commercial fuel fabrication facilities. Changing the waste fee to base it on the amount of radioactivity in the spent fuel would enhance the economic benefit of high burnup.

The purpose of these experiments was to provide data to benchmark nuclear transport codes for targets irradiated by protons in this energy range, as well as to evaluate design options to maximize the production of spallation neutrons in various targets under consideration. These computer codes are used to design accelerator systems that will utilize spallation neutrons for the generation of tritium, transmutation of nuclear waste, production of radioisotopes, and other scientific investigations. Some of the targets used in this investigation were semiprototypic of the proposed Accelerator Production of Tritium target. Other targets were included to provide data to test the computational models in the codes. Total neutron production is the main factor that determines the economics of transmutation for a particular accelerator design. Comparisons of the data reported here with calculations from computer simulations show agreement to within 15% over the entire energy. region for most of the targets.

J	Turner, SE				Turner, SE			Reactivity effects of streaming between discrete boron carbide particles in neutron absorber panels for storage or transport of spent nuclear fuel	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article								In recent years, neutron attenuation measurements have demonstrated that neutron absorber panels with discrete boron carbide particles are less effective in neutron absorption than equivalent homogenous absorber panels. The penalty observed in these attenuation measurements with thermal neutrons has been assumed to apply to the criticality analysis of fuel storage cells, without regard to the very significant difference in the neutron spectrum involved. Furthermore, the attenuation measurements are made with a collimated beam of thermalized neutrons impinging perpendicularly on the absorber panel, whereas in fuel storage cells, the neutrons are nearly isotropic and impinge on the panel at all angles. In an effort to understand the phenomena involved and to more accurately determine the effect on criticality safety analyses, calculations were made with the MCNP code, which is capable of explicitly describing discrete B4C particles of various mean size. Results of these calculations, described herein, show that neutron attenuation measurements are only weakly related to criticality analysis and that the penalty seen in attenuation measurements does not apply and should not be directly applied in criticality analyses.

About 24% of the spent resins was oxidized at 600 to 900 K. Online Fourier transform infrared spectra showed that the decomposition of the -SO3H species in the resin to SO2 occurred at 670 and 1020 K. The numerical calculation from TGA weight loss data at different heating rates showed that the global activation energies for oxidation of the spent resins were 108 to 138 kJ(.)mol(-1). The reaction orders for resin and oxygen were about 1.0 and 3.5, respectively. The global rate equations for oxidation of the resin in the first and second stages can be expressed as dx(1)/dt (s(-1)) = 2.3 X 10(7) (s(-1))exp[-117900(J.mol(-1))/T(K)][1-x (%)](0.82) [O-2(Vt%)](3.5) (x denotes the reaction conversion) and dx(2)/dt = 8.4 X 10(17) exp(-239500/RT) (1 - x)(0.9)[O-2](4.5), respectively.
