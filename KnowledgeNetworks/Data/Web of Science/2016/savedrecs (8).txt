J	Yin, JL; Ma, YF; Qian, YL; Wang, DZ				Yin, Junlian; Ma, Yanfei; Qian, Yalan; Wang, Dezhong			Experimental investigation of the bubble separation route for an axial gas-liquid separator for TMSR	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Gas-liquid separator; Gas core; Two-phase flow; MSR	NATURAL CIRCULATION INSTABILITY; SWIRLING FLOW; IDENTIFICATION	The gas-liquid separator plays a key role in the fission gas removal system for Thorium Molten Salt Reactor (TMSR). The separation principle in swirling flows indicates that the bubbles will be gathered in the swirl chamber center. These bubbles can be collected in three ways, including through the upstream orificeonly (UO), the downstream orifice (DO) only or two orifices simultaneously (TO). As a follow-up study, this paper is focused on the effect of the bubble collection on the separator performances. To do this, experiments for each collection scheme were conducted under different Reynolds numbers and swirling numbers. The experimental results suggest that the collection ways influence the two-phase flow patterns dramatically. To compare the performances between the TO and UO, the critical backpressure and the liquid entrainment ratio were summarized. The results show that the critical backpressure for the UO is much higher than that for the TO. However, the liquid entrainment ratio for the UO is very close to that for the TO. Therefore, the selection of the separation path is of significance to the efficient operation of the gas-liquid separator. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

All experiments were performed in batch mode at ambient temperature. Among the tested biomasses, rice bran was selected because of high sorption of U4+. The sorption capacity obtained from distribution isotherm indicated value of 42.9 mg g(-1) for rice bran. Additionally, the sorption equilibrium was achieved in less than 5 min. With the increase in the amount of granular zinc, uranium uptake efficiency was improved from 14% to 98%. The sorption efficiencies of uranium by rice bran in the concentration range of 133-3333 mg L-1 were relatively constant (>91.5%) with RSD less than 1.5%. The selectivity coefficient value of rice bran for U4+ ion was >621-fold and >5460-fold greater than Ln(+3) ions and Zn2+ ion respectively. The maximum desorption of uranium was observed in the first stage (>89.7%) with (NH4)(2)CO3 and (NH4)(2)C2O4. The selected biosorbent has the potential to be applied on an industrial scale due to economic and operational benefits. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Neutronic and thermo hydraulic analysis of a modeled subcritical uranyl nitrate aqueous reactor driven by 30-MeV protons	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Mo-99 production; Subcritical aqueous reactor; Uranyl nitrate solution; Neutronic and thermo-hydraulic performance; CYCLONE30		Recently aqueous homogeneous reactors have been taken in the spotlight again because of their good potential for radioisotope product since ARGUS exhibits such successful experience. Accelerator-driven types of such aqueous homogeneous reactors are being investigated and designed due to some their prominent advantages than the used ones by operation in critical level. The present work discusses neutronic and thermo-hydraulic performance of a modeled accelerator-driven aqueous homogeneous reactor. 30 MeV protons with 150 mu A current were considered to induce fission process inside the core involving uranyl nitrate solution. Monte Carlo-based computational code was used to model such sub critical system. FLUENT code was used to determine the temperature distribution inside the operated subcritical core with an offered simplified geometry. The carried out calculations showed that the modeled system with external beam window positioning experiences 4.683 kW fission-related power. A neutron flux of the order of 10(11) n/s.cm(2) is available inside the subcritical core. Enough negative reactivity coefficient of the modeled core moreover its subcritical level operation assures the core inherent safety. The system can be used to produce an adequate yield of different radioisotopes per week. Thermo hydraulic system used for the modeled core could efficiently remove the aqueous core produced heat and keep the core temperature below 70 degrees C. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Neutronics and thermal hydraulics analysis of a small modular reactor	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Small modular reactor; Integral pressurized water reactor; Neutronics assessment; Safety analysis		The small modular reactor (SMR) offers many feasible pathways for the construction of more nuclear power plants. A physics model of a near term deployable SMR of the integral pressurized water reactor (IPWR) design is developed. Fuel depletion simulations are performed to optimize the active fuel length, fuel enrichment and core loading pattern in order to achieve a uniform core power distribution. The optimized core can produce 500 MW of thermal power with a four year core life-time at a capacity factor of 87%. The core consists of 69 uranium dioxide (UO2) fuel assemblies; 5 assemblies at 4.4 at% U-235 enrichment and 64 assemblies at 4.95 at% U-235 enrichment. The active fuel length is 200 cm and the core diameter is 194.55 cm for an active core height-to-diameter ratio of 1.03. As part of the study the active fuel length is increased to 240 cm resulting in an increased capacity factor of 95% at 530 MW of thermal power output for an active core height-to-diameter ratio of 1.23. Rod cluster control assemblies (RCCAs) are placed strategically to reduce the overall core power peaking factor to 1.3. Estimated reactor kinetics parameters such as the delayed neutron fraction and mean neutron generation time are typical of existing larger pressurized water reactors (PWRs) from which much of the IPWR based SMR design is derived. This study showed that Doppler, moderator temperature, void and power reactivity coefficients are all negative over the core life-time of four years indicating the possibility of safe reactor operation. A semi-analytical thermal hydraulics analysis reveals acceptable radial and axial fuel element temperature profiles with significant safety margin from industry standards on peak fuel and clad surface temperature limits. The critical heat flux (CHF) is calculated and is not exceeded even in 10% overpower conditions. In addition the nucleate boiling ratio (DNBR) is calculated and found to be above 4.8 for the entirety of the active core region. These parameters further engender confidence in the safety of the SMR design. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Development, verification, and validation of a fuel thermal conductivity degradation model in CTF	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Fuel thermal conductivity; Fuel centerline temperature; CTF; FRAPCON-3.4		This paper discusses the implementation of a burnup dependent fuel thermal conductivity model within the Reactor Dynamics and Fuel Modeling Group (RDFMG) version of the subchannel thermal-hydraulics code COBRA-TF (CTF). The model takes into account the degradation of fuel thermal conductivity at high burnups and its dependence on the Gadolinium content for both UO2 (uranium dioxide) and MOX (mixed oxide) nuclear fuel rods. The modified Nuclear Fuel Industries (NFI) model for UO2 rods and the Duriez/Modified NFI model for MOX rods were incorporated in CTF. To validate the models, the fuel centerline temperatures predicted with CTF were compared to Halden reactor experimental data and to high fidelity FRAPCON-3.4 calculations. Halden test cases for UO2 fuel rods at the beginning of life (BOL), through lifetime with and without Gd2O3; and for MOX fuel rods were simulated with CTF. It was demonstrated that CTF with the new burnup dependent fuel thermal conductivity model predicts the fuel centerline temperature with less than a 5% error as compared to the Halden measurements. CTF calculations were performed for fifty-eight (58) data points. Statistical analyses of the dimensionless predicted-to-measured fuel centerline temperature ratios had confirmed the advantage of the new model - the mean value of the predicted-to-measured temperature ratios was increased from 0.8920 to 1.0082 and the standard deviation was decreased from 0.0693 to 0.0382.

The 14 MeV neutron irradiation facility described here can nearly exactly duplicate the neutron spectrum typical of a DT fusion reactor first wall at damage rates of approximate to 4 displacements per atom and 40 appm He generated over a 2 l volume per full power year of operation. The projected cost of this multi-beam facility is estimated at approximate to$20 million and it can be built in <4 years. A single-beam prototype, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, is already being built to produce medical isotopes. The neutrons are produced by a 300 keV deuterium beam accelerated into 4 kPa (30 Torr) tritium target. The total tritium inventory is <2 g and <0.1 g of T-2 is consumed per year. The core technology proposed has already been fully demonstrated, and no new plasma physics or materials innovations will be required for the test facility to become operational.

TPE upgrade for enhancing operational safety and improving in-vessel tritium inventory assessment in fusion nuclear environment	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 14-18, 2015	Jeju, SOUTH KOREA			Tritium plasma experiment; Tritium in-vessel inventory; Neutron-irradiated materials		The Tritium Plasma Experiment (TPE) is a unique high-flux linear plasma device that can handle beryllium, tritium, and neutron-irradiated plasma facing materials, and is the only existing device dedicated to evaluate in-vessel tritium inventory in the nuclear environment for fusion safety. The electrical upgrade were recently carried out to enhance operational safety and to improve plasma performance. New DC power supplies and a new control center enable remote plasma operations from outside of the contamination area for tritium, minimizing the possible exposure risk with tritium and beryllium and eliminating heat stress issue. In November 2015, the TPE successfully achieved first deuterium plasma via remote operation after a significant three-year upgrade. Simple linear scaling estimate showed that the TPE is expected to achieve Gamma(max)(i) of >1.0 x 10(23) m(-2) s(-1) and q(heat) of >1 MW m(-2) with new power supplies. This upgrade not only improves operational safety of the worker, but also enhances plasma performance to better simulate extreme plasma-material conditions expected in ITER, FNSF, and DEMO for improving in-vessel tritium inventory assessment in fusion nuclear environment.

With respect to the tritium release characteristics of the blanket, the optimum grain size after sintering was less than 5 mu m. Therefore, an emulsion method was developed to fabricate pebbles with this target grain size. The predominant factor affecting grain growth was assumed to be the presence of binder in the gel particles; this remaining binder was hypothesized to react with the excess Li, thereby generating Li2CO3, which promotes grain growth. To inhibit the generation of Li2CO3, calcined Li2+xTiO3+y pebbles were sintered under vacuum and subsequently under a 1% H-2-He atmosphere. The average grain size of the sintered Li2+xTiO3+y pebbles was less than 5 mu m. Furthermore, the tritium release properties of Li2+xTiO3+y pebbles were evaluated, and deuterium tritium (DT) neutron irradiation experiments were performed at the Fusion Neutronics Source facility in the Japan Atomic Energy Agency. To remove the tritium produced by neutron irradiation, 1% H-2-He purge gas was passed through the Li2+xTiO3+y pebbles. The Li2+xTiO3+y pebbles exhibited good tritium release properties, similar to those of Li2TiO3 pebbles. In particular, the released amount of tritiated hydrogen gas for easier tritium handling was greater than the released amount of tritiated water. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to acquire the detailed tritium recovery performances, we have started a new blanket tritium recovery experiment with ionization chamber (IC) at JAEA/ENS. For the appropriate tritium measurement with IC, we improved the experimental container and carried out with an intense DT neutron source at JAEA/FNS. From our new experiment, the tritium recovery radioactivity from the LSC measurement corresponds with the calculation within 6%.

To fulfill this requirement, it is mandatory to test the port plugs at operating temperature before installation on the machine and after refurbishment. The ITER port plug test facility (PPTF) is composed of several test stands that can be used to test the port plugs whereas at the end of manufacturing (in a non-nuclear environment), or after refurbishment in the ITER hot cell facility. The PPTF provides the possibility to perform environmental (leak tightness, vacuum and thermo-hydraulic performances) and functional tests (radio frequency acceptance tests, behavior of the plugs' steering mechanism and calibration of diagnostics) on upper and equatorial port plugs. The final design of the port plug test facility is described. The configuration of the standalone test stands and the integration" in the hot cell facility are presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Previous published benchmark results of TRIPOLI-4 code on the ITER related activities have concentrated on the first wall loading, the reactor dosimetry, the nuclear heating, and the tritium breeding ratio. To enhance the TRIPOLI-4 verification and validation on neutron-gamma coupled calculations for fusion device application, the computational ITER shielding benchmark of M. E. Sawan was performed in this work by using the 2013 released TRIPOLI-4.9S code and the associated CEA-V5.1.1 data library. First wall, blanket, vacuum vessel and toroidal field magnet of the inboard and outboard components were fully modelled in this 1-D toroidal cylindrical benchmark. The 14.1 MeV source neutrons were sampled from a uniform isotropic distribution in the plasma zone. Nuclear responses including neutron and gamma fluxes, nuclear heating, and material damage indicator were benchmarked against previous published results. The capabilities of the TRIPOLI-4 code on the evaluation of above physics parameters were presented. The nuclear data library from the new FENDL-3.0 evaluation was also benchmarked against the CEA-V5.1.1 results for the neutron transport calculations. The results show that both data libraries can be run with TRIPOLI-4 for the fusion neutronics study. This work also demonstrates that the "safety factors" concept is necessary in the nuclear analyses of ITER. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The thermal desorption behavior and the reduction of tritium retention during vacuum preservation at room temperature, as well as isochronal annealing were investigated using an IP technique, taking advantage of the fact that tritium detection is nondestructive and is highly sensitive. At a pre-irradiated helium fluence of 1 x 10(17) He/cm(2), retained tritium tended to be desorbed at higher temperatures when compared to no helium irradiation case. Tritium retention during preservation in vacuum and during isochronal annealing became smaller with increasing helium fluence up to 1 x 10(17) He/cm(2). At a helium fluence of 1 x 10(18) He/cm(2), the reduction of tritium retention was found to be greater compared to 1 x 10(17) He/cm(2). The results indicate that helium irradiation has a significant influence not only on the thermal desorption temperature of tritium but on longtime tritium reduction at room and elevated temperatures.

In the frame of the EUROfusion Consortium activities, the Breeding Blanket Project has been constituted in 2014 with the goal to develop concepts of Breeding Blankets for the EU PPPT DEMO; this includes an integrated design and R&D programme with the goal to select after 2020 concepts on fusion plants for the engineering phase. The design activities are presently focalized around a pool of solid and liquid breeder blanket with helium, water and PbLi cooling. Development of tritium extraction and control technology, as well manufacturing and development of solid and PbLi breeders are part of the programme. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

A dedicated automated procedure was developed to fill the breeding modules in the common generic model in correspondence to the different concepts. The TBR calculations were carried out using the MCNP5 Monte Carlo code. The following parameters affecting the-global TBR were investigated: TBR poloidal distribution, radial breeder zone depth, Li-6 enrichment, steel content in the breeder modules, poloidal segmentation of the breeder blanket volume, size of gaps between blankets, thickness of the first wall and of the tungsten armour. Based on the results a set of practical guidelines was prepared for the designers developing the individual breeding blanket concepts with the goal to achieve the required tritium breeding performance in DEMO.

Some reports indicate that a large amount of hydrogen isotope is incorporated into tungsten deposits growing by hydrogen plasma sputtering. However, the mechanism of hydrogen incorporation is not clarified yet. In this work, tungsten deposits were formed at different circumstances in the sputtering device and the amount of incorporated hydrogen was measured. The implantation of hydrogen reflected from the sputtering target was mainly contributed to the hydrogen incorporation. The contribution of the implantation of reactive hydrogen from plasma was smaller than that of the reflected hydrogen in the experimental condition. A detectable amount of tungsten deposits was formed even in the shadow region from the sputtering target. This suggests that a certain amount of tungsten atoms, which lost its initial energy by collision with molecular hydrogen, diffuses in the gas phase and adheres in the shadow region.

Together with the isolation valve it constitutes the primary vacuum boundary and it also acts as first tritium barrier. Therefore the window is classified as Safety/Protection Important Component (SIC/PIC) with the nuclear safety function "confinement". As the diamond window unit is not entirely covered by standard codes, an ad-hoc qualification program needs to be defined, including analysis, prototyping and testing. In the framework of a contract with F4E, the test program for a diamond window prototype is being developed with the aim to prove its operability for normal, accidental and incidental conditions as identified in the ITER load specifications. Tests range from dielectric loss measurements for the bare Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) diamond disk up to mechanical and vacuum tests for the complete window assembly. Finally mm-wave properties have to be characterized for the complete window. A clear definition of the testing requirements and of the acceptance criteria is necessary as well as a complete documentation of the process. This paper will present the development of the test plan for a window prototype, which is currently under manufacturing. First tests are directed to the characterization of the bare diamond disk with a focus on its dielectric properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These projects have been carried out to obtain basic data for the design of DEMO fusion reactor from 2007. For 8-year activities, the above projects could produce a set of fruitful results for the DEMO reactor. DEMO design activity has been conducted to build a set of DEMO design bases in accordance with a series of discussion between EU and JA. In the DEMO R&D activities, five basic R&D subjects for a DEMO blanket system have been selected, and been studies under close collaborations between EU and JA: structure materials (RAFM steels and SiC/SiC composites), functional materials (tritium breeders and neutron multipliers), and tritium technology. Some additional R&D subjects recommended by peer review comments have also been studied successfully in recent years. Regarding the IFMIF/EVEDA project, some main components of the accelerator facility been designed and tested. The validation test using EVEDA Lithium Test Loop (ELTL) was also completed successfully in October 2014. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

During such measurements, control and evaluation of the wraparound flow through the sample holder are important, and so the heated sample holder is enclosed by a glass tube and kept under vacuum during experimental trials. However, detailed studies regarding the required degree of vacuum based on model calculations have shown that the wraparound flow is much larger than expected, and so can affect measurements at high temperatures. We therefore modified the measurement apparatus based on calculations involving reduced pressure in the glass tube, and are now confident that the measurement error is only several percent, even at 950 degrees C. In this paper, recent experimental results obtained with a chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-SiC sample over the temperature range of 600-950 degrees C are presented, showing that the permeation coefficient for CVD-SiC is more than three orders of magnitude smaller than that for stainless steel (SS316) at 600 degrees C, and that at 950 degrees C, the coefficient for CVD-SiC is almost equal to that for SUS316 at 550 degrees C.

The outputs, benefits and lessons learned associated with the production of this Safety Case are presented. The changes that have occurred to the Safety Case methodology since the last JET tritium Safety Case are reviewed. Consideration is given to the effects of modifications, particularly ITER related changes, made to the JET and the impact these have on the hazard assessments as well as normal operations. Several specialized assessments, including recent MELCOR modelling, have been undertaken to support the production of this Safety Case and the impact of these assessments is outlined. Discussion of the preliminary actions being taken to progress implementation of this Safety Case is provided, highlighting new methods to improve the dissemination of the key Safety Case results to the plant operators. Finally, the work required to complete this Safety Case, before the next tritium campaign, is summarized. (C) 2016 EURATOM. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The basic concept of DEMO premised for investigation has been identified and the structure of technological issues to ensure the feasibility of this DEMO concept has been examined. The Joint-Core Team, which was launched along with the request by the ministerial council, has compiled analyses in two reports to clarify technology which should be secured, maintained, and developed in Japan, to share the common targets among industry, government, and academia, and to activate actions under a framework for implementation throughout Japan. The reports have pointed out that DEMO should be aimed at steady power generation beyond several hundred thousand kilowatts, availability which must be extended to commercialization, and overall tritium breeding to fulfill self-sufficiency of fuels. The necessary technological activities, such as superconducting coils, blanket, divertor, and others, have been sorted out and arranged in the chart with the time line toward the decision on DEMO. Based upon these Joint-Core Team reports, related actions are emerging to deliberate the Japanese fusion roadmap. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Current design of the European TBM systems and implications on DEMO breeding blanket	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 14-18, 2015	Jeju, SOUTH KOREA			Breeding blanket; Test Blanket System; Tritium extraction	ITER	Europe is committed in developing the design of the two Test Blanket Systems (TBS) based on HCLL (Helium Cooled Lithium Lead) and HCPB (Helium Cooled Pebble Bed) breeding blanket (BB) concepts. The complexity of the TBS design comes not only from the innovative fabrication technologies and materials adopted for Test Blanket Modules (TBM) but also from the requirements and functions that the TBM ancillary systems have to satisfy and implement. Indeed, the main TBM ancillary systems, namely the Helium Cooling System, the Coolant Purification System and Tritium Extraction System, all belonging to the Safety Important Class (SIC), have to implement fundamental functions, like the transport of the surface and volumetric heat from the TBM to the heat sink, the extraction and processing of the tritium generated in the TBM, the confinement of radioactive inventory, the support to the investment protection and safety functions. On top of the full compliance with the ITER safety principles, the design of the TBM systems is focused on providing high operational reliability and availability not to jeopardize ITER program and, at the same time, also a good operational flexibility to make possible the achievement of the main TBM scientific objectives. This paper gives an overview of the design status of the HCLL and HCPB-TBM (ancillary) systems, updated to the conclusion of the conceptual design phase (CDR). The most relevant technologies, the still open points, the main issues related to the integration in ITER and last relevant results from the on-going R&D activities carried out in Europe are presented and discussed. In the last part, different considerations are proposed about the impact of the design and operation of the main HCLL and HCPB-TBM ancillary systems technologies on the design of a DEMO BB.

A PERMCAT reactor combines a catalyst promoting isotope exchange reactions and a Pd/Ag membrane allowing tritium recovery from complex gaseous mixtures containing tritium in different chemical forms. Originally developed for the Tokamak Exhaust Processing, the PERMCAT process is also candidate to detritiate the water arising from an adsorption column installed in the TBM ancillary systems. We discuss the results of an extensive experimental campaign using a PERMCAT reactor to process Q(2)O containing impurity gas mixtures at high flow rates. Two different experimental configurations were studied, namely PERMCAT stand-alone, and PERMCAT in combination with a zeolite molecular sieve bed (MSB, previously loaded with Q(2)O) under regeneration. On the one hand, many expected behaviors were observed, such as the key influence of the swamping ratio (ratio between the impurity and purge side flow rates) on the decontamination factors. On the other hand, some rather unexpected effects tend to show that the limiting phenomena of such specific operation of PERMCAT reactors (at high flow rates, thus short residence time) lies on the kinetics of the isotope exchange reactions.

Impurities limit goals in IFMIF are determined as <10 wppm for D, and <1 wppm for T to realize safety and stability of Li flow. In order to demonstrate the effective operation of Y hot trap and give actual proof based on experimental data, an experimental study is performed under Li fluidized conditions simulating IFMIF. D recovery down to 10 wppm is demonstrated under fluidized Li conditions, where only D is included in Li. In addition, since there is possibility in that N in Li contaminates Y surfaces, influence of N included in Li is investigated to clarify recovery performance of Y hot trap. It was proved that Y hot trap can work effectively even in real IFMIF conditions to achieve the goal of Li purity limit necessary for its operation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This implies sample taking, sample preparation and radioactive waste processing afterwards. When handling highly tritiated water special care has to be taken because of possible harmfulness of the sample. Furthermore, LSC devices are mostly large, heavy and expensive. The TRAMPEL experiment aims at measuring the activity of tritiated water in-line without sample taking. The device is intended to be easy to use and operate, quite inexpensive and compact. The measurement principle is based on electrons from beta-decay which induce light in commercially available scintillation fibres. The light is detected by a small photomultiplier tube (PMT). A proof-of-principle was set up for static measurements using standard stainless steel parts. The complete device has a volume of less than 0.51. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The spill of a large amount of tritiated water to the environment is a concern accident because huge tritiated water is handled in a fusion plant. In this work, a simple tritium transport model was proposed based on the tritium transport model in porous materials. The overall mass transfer coefficient representing isotope exchange reaction between tritiated water and structural water in soil particles was obtained by numerically analyzing the result of the percolation experiment of tritiated water into the soil packed bed. Saturated hydraulic conductivity in the natural soil packed bed was obtained to be 0.033 mm/s. By using this value, the overall mass transfer capacity coefficients representing the isotope exchange reaction between tritiated water percolating through the packed bed and overall structural water on soil particles was determined to be 6.0 x 10(-4) 1/s. This value is much smaller than the mass transfer capacity coefficient between tritiated water vapor and water on concrete material and metals. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Investigations of the applicability of a new accountancy tool in a closed tritium loop	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 14-18, 2015	Jeju, SOUTH KOREA			Accountancy; BIXS; Beta induced X-ray spectrometry; Monitoring; Tritium	MANAGEMENT; BLANKETS; ISSUES; DEMO; ITER; TLK	A commonly used activity monitoring method for tritium accountancy and process monitoring in tritium technology is ionization counting. Despite the wide use of ionization chambers (IC), they have several drawbacks like a strong gas species and pressure dependency. Furthermore, if compact systems are needed, there is also the necessity for process gas pressures >10 kPa. To encounter these drawbacks, the TRitium Activity Chamber Experiment (TRACE) has been developed at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK) as a compact tritium monitor based on the beta induced X-ray spectrometry (BIXS) principle. TRACE can be used as an accountancy tool in tritium-processing facilities like the KArlsruhe TRltium Neutrino (KATRIN) experiment. In contrast to ICs TRACE shows a linear response to pressure changes up to approx. 1 kPa. The results of performed flow-through measurements confirm that TRACE is a complement for ICs in the low-pressure regime. Furthermore the gas species dependency of TRACE is investigated both with tritium measurements and with Monte Carlo simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Cristescu, I				Cristescu, Ion			Enhanced configuration of a water detritiation system; impact on ITER Isotope Separation System based cryogenic distillation	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 14-18, 2015	Jeju, SOUTH KOREA			Water detritiation; Tritium enrichment; Isotope separation; Cryogenic distillation		Tritiated water is generated in the ITER systems by various sources and may contain deuterium and tritium at various concentrations. The reference process for the ITER Water Detritiation System is based on Combined Electrolysis Catalytic Exchange (CECE) configuration. During long time operation of the CECE process, the accumulation of deuterium in the electrolysis unit and consequently along the Liquid Phase Catalytic Exchange (LPCE) column is unavoidable with consequences on the overall detritiation factor of the system. Beside the deuterium issue in the process, the large amount of the tritiated water with tritium activity up to 500 Ci/kg in the electrolysis cells is a concern from the safety aspect of the plant. The enhanced configuration of a system for processing tritiated water allows mitigation of the effects due to deuterium accumulation and also reduction of tritium inventory within the electrolysis system. In addition the benefits concerning to the interface between the water detritiation system and tritium recovery based cryogenic distillation are also presented. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Thanks to protium isotope swamping, tritium bonded water can be recovered under the valuable Q(2) form (Q= H, D or T) by means of isotope exchange reactions occurring on catalyst surface. The use of permselective Pd-based membrane allows withdrawal of reactions products all along the reactor, and thus limits reverse reaction rate to the benefit of the direct one (shift effect). The reactions kinetics, which are still little known or unknown, are generally assumed to be largely greater than the permeation ones so that thermodynamic equilibriums of isotope exchange reactions are generally assumed. This paper proposes a new phenomenological 2D model to represent catalytic membrane reactor behavior with the determination of gas effluents compositions. A good agreement was obtained between the simulation results and experimental measurements performed on a dedicated facility. Furthermore, the gas composition estimation permits to interpret unexpected behavior of the catalytic membrane reactor. In the next future, further sensitivity analysis will be performed to determine the limits of the model and a kinetics study will be conducted to assess the thermodynamic equilibrium of reactions.

The waste concerns components that are activated by neutrons of energies up to 14 MeV, and are contaminated by activated corrosion products, activated dust and tritium. Even if the nuclear waste production will start only with the deuterium-deuterium phase, provisions have to be taken now with the design of the ITER facilities that will be used for the treatment and interim storage of the waste, in order to demonstrate that all the ITER waste will be safely manageable with the existing outlets. This demonstration also needs to be provided to the French regulator. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Rosanvallon, S.; Torcy, D.; Chon, J.

The assessment is based on the initial design versions of the blankets developed in 2014. The Tritium breeding potential is considered sufficient for all breeder blankets although the initial design versions of the HCPB, HCLL and DCLL blankets were shown to require further design improvements. Suitable measures have been proposed and proven to be sufficient to achieve the required Tritium Breeding Ratio (TBR) >= 1.10. The shielding performance was shown to be sufficient to protect the super-conducting toroidal field coil provided that efficient shielding material mixtures including WC or borated water are utilized. The WCLL blanket does not require the use of such shielding materials due to a very compact blanket support structure/manifold configuration which yet requires design verification. The vacuum vessel can be safely operated over the full anticipated DEMO lifetime of 6 full power years for all blanket concepts considered. (C) 2016 Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

The alloys were prepared by vacuum arc melting technique and subsequently cold rolled to 0.2 mm thickness. The terminal solid solubility of hydrogen in these cold rolled samples was investigated in a modified Sieverts apparatus. The terminal solid solubility of hydrogen was marginally increased with zirconium content.

One of the challenges for SiC/SiC application in fusion reactors is to satisfy sufficient gas leak tightness of hydrogen and helium isotopes. Although many efforts have been carried-out, SiC/SiC composites by conventional processes have not been successful to satisfy the requirements, except SiC/SiC composites by NITE-methods. Toward the early realization of SiC/SiC components into fusion reactor systems process development of NITE-process has been continued. Followed to the brief introduction of recently developed DEMO-NITE process, baseline properties and hydrogen and helium gas leak tightness is presented. SiC/SiC claddings with 10 mm in diameter and 1 mm in wall thickness are tested by gas leak tightness system developed. The leak tightness measurements are done room temperature to 400 degrees C. Excellent gas leak tightness equivalent or superior to Zircaloy claddings for light water fission reactors is confirmed. The excellent gas leak tightness suggests nearly perfect suppression of large gas leak path in DEMO-NITE SiC/SiC. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The physics involved includes compressible purge gas fluid flow, heat transfer, chemical reaction, isotope swamping effect, and tritium isotopes mass transport. The strategy adopted here is to develop numerical procedures and techniques that allow critical details of material, geometric and operational heterogeneity in a most complete engineering description of the TBS being incorporated into the simulation. Our application focuses on the transient assessment in view of ITER being pulsed operations. An immediate advantage is a more realistic predictive and design analysis tool accounting pulsed operations induced temperature variations which impact helium purge gas flow as well as Q(2) composition concentration time and space evolutions in the breeding regions. This affords a more accurate prediction of tritium permeation into the He coolant by accounting correct temperature and partial pressure effects and realistic diffusion paths. The analysis also shows that by introducing by-pass line to accommodate ITER pulsed operations in the TES loop allows tritium extraction design being more cost effective. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Reducing beryllium content in mixed bed solid-type breeder blankets	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 14-18, 2015	Jeju, SOUTH KOREA			Fusion; Energy; Blanket; Beryllium; Neutronics		Beryllium (Be) is a precious resource with many high value uses, the low energy threshold (n,2n) reaction makes Be an excellent neutron multiplier for use in fusion breeder blankets. Estimates of Be requirements and available resources suggest that this could represent a major supply difficulty for solid-type blanket concepts. Reducing the quantity of Be required by breeder blankets would help to alleviate the problem to some extent. In addition, it is important that the reduction in the Be quantity does not diminish the blanket's performance in key aspects such as the tritium breeding ratio (TBR), energy multiplication and peak nuclear heating. Mixed pebble bed designs allow for the multiplier fraction to be varied throughout the blanket. This neutronics study used MCNP 6 to investigate linear variations of the multiplier fraction in relation to blanket depth, in order to better utilise the important multiplying Be(n,2n) and breeding reactions. Blankets with a uniform multiplier fraction showed little scope for reduction in Be mass. Blankets with varying multiplier fractions were able to simultaneously use 10% less Be, increase the energy amplification by 1%, reduce the peak heating by 7% and maintaining a sufficient TBR when compared to the performance achievable using a uniform composition.

In this study, basic performance of the present system has been examined using various tritium-containing samples. It was seen that energy linearity, energy resolution and sensitivity were quite enough for measurements of low energy X-rays induced by beta-rays. Intensity of characteristic X-rays emitted from the surface and/or bulk of a tritium-containing sample was lowered by argon used as a working gas of the Advanced-BIXS. Pressure dependence of transmittance of C(Ka) and Fe(K-alpha) was examined as examples of low and high energy X-rays, and it was able to represent by using the mass absorption coefficient in argon. It was concluded, therefore, that the present system has high potentiality for nondestructive measurements of tritium retained in surface layers and/or bulk of fusion related materials.

To recover tritiated water vapor, adoption of dryer that is packed column of synthetic zeolite has been proposed. On the other hand, synthetic zeolite is often used as a support of precious metal catalyst. Such catalysts usually have a capability of hydrogen isotope exchange between gas and water vapor. If this catalyst is used to dryer, the dryer may obtain a preferable function for tritium recovery by isotopic exchange reaction. To assess such functions, reaction rate should be estimated. The results of water adsorption experiment on cation-exchanged mordenite-type zeolite suggested the possibility that state of adsorbed water varied by exchanged cation. So, in this work, precious metal catalyst based on cation-exchanged mordenite was prepared, and the reaction rate of chemical exchange between hydrogen and tritiated water was investigated under temperature range between 30 degrees C and 80 C by the steady-state approximation. In the case of platinum on Na-mordenite, the reaction between gaseous hydrogen and tritiated water vapor was almost expressed as first-order reaction concerning tritiated water vapor concentration.

Since its melting point is higher than other liquid candidates, another new fluoride molten salt Flinabe (LiF + NaF+ BeF2) is recently focused on because of its lower melting point while holding proper breeding properties. In this experiment, hydrogen permeation behavior through the three molten salts of Flibe (2LiF + BeF2), Fnabe (NaF+ BeF2) and Flinabe are investigated in order to clarify the effects of their compositions on hydrogen transfer properties. After making up any of the three molten salts and purifying it using HF, hydrogen permeability, diffusivity and solubility of the molten salts are determined experimentally by using a system composed of tertiary cylindrical tubes. Close agreement is obtained between experimental data and analytical solutions. H2 permeability, diffusivity and solubility are correlated as a function of temperature and are compared among the three molten salts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The facility is designed such that it is shielded from the outside for safety against tritium and a getter pump is used for evacuating the vacuum chamber and feeding the fuel gas. A deuterium tritium gas mixture with 93% deuterium and 7% tritium is used, and its neutron production rate is measured to be 5-8 times more than that of pure deuterium gas. Moreover, the results show good agreement with those of a simplified theoretical estimation of the neutron production rate. After tritium burning, the exhausted fuel gas undergoes a tritium recovery procedure through a water bubbler device. The amount of gaseous tritium released by the developed IECF facility after tritium burning is verified to be much less than the threshold set by regulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

As part of the lengthy process which should lead to mastering nuclear fusion, different fusion facility projects are currently under study throughout the world to be ready to continue building on the work which will take place in the ITER facility. On the basis of the experience acquired during the ITER safety expertise, the IRSN has carried out a preliminary study of the safety issues which seem necessary to take into account right from the earliest design phase of these DEMO facilities. The issues studied have included the decay heat removal, exposure to ionizing radiation, potential accidents, and effluent releases and waste. The study shows that it will be important to give priority to the following actions, given that their results would have a major influence on the design: assess if decay heat removal is a safety function, re-study the accidents considered in the context of the ITER project and identify those specific to DEMO, and optimize each of the main routes for gaseous tritium releases.

However, few syntheses of fine-grain, high-purity Li8ZrO6 powder have been reported. In this study, a high-purity powder of Li8ZrO6 was synthesized by solid state reaction under hydrogen atmosphere combined with an effective lithium source and a suitable initial Li:Zr molar ratio. Mixed powders of Li2CO3 and ZrO2 were fired at around 630 degrees C in H-2 for several hours and several firing cycles. The low firing temperature inhibited the vaporization of Li during the heating, so that excessive amounts of Li were not needed for the synthesis, and the Li:Zr ratio in the starting material was 10:1 (mol:mol). In this synthesis, Li2O was generated via the decomposition of Li2CO3 during firing in H-2, and reacted with ZrO2 to form Li6Zr2O7, which reacted with itself to form Li8ZrO6. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The parametric dependences of tritium extraction efficiency from the main geometrical features such as initial droplet velocity, nozzle head height, nozzle diameter, and flow rate are discussed. With nozzle diameters between 0.4 and 0.6 mm, extraction efficiency is estimated from 0.77 to 0.96 at the falling height of 0.5 m, with flow rate between 0.2 and 1.0 kg/s. The device has a height of 1.6 m, within the external dimensions of the HCLL Test Blanket Module (TBM), and no additional pumping power is required. The attained results are considered attractive not only for ITER, but also in view of the application of the VST concept as a candidate tritium extraction system for the European Union's demonstration fusion reactor (DEMO). The extraction efficiency of a single droplet column, which is the basis of the design analysis presented, has been validated experimentally with hydrogen. However, further experiments are required on an integrated system with size relevant to the proposed HCLL-TBS design to validate system-level effects, particularly regarding the desorption process in an array of multiple droplets.

Physical and economical aspects of Pu multiple recycling on the basis of REMIX reprocessing technology in thermal reactors	EPJ NUCLEAR SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article							PLUTONIUM; FUEL; URANIUM; MIXTURE; CORE; LOAD	The basic strategy of Russian nuclear energy is propagation of a closed fuel cycle on the basis of fast breeder and thermal reactors, as well as the solution of the spent nuclear fuel accumulation and resource problems. The three variants of multiple Pu and U recycling in Russian pressurized water reactor concept reactors on the basis of REgenerated MIXture of U, Pu oxides (REMIX) reprocessing technology are considered in this work. The REMIX fuel is fabricated from an unseparated mixture of uranium and plutonium obtained during spent fuel reprocessing with further makeup by enriched natural U or reactor grade Pu. This makes it possible to recycle several times the total amount of Pu obtained from the spent fuel. The main difference in Pu recycling is the concept of 100% or partial fuel loading of the core. The third variant is heterogeneous composition of enriched uranium and uranium-plutonium mixed oxide fuel pins in one fuel assembly. It should be noted that all fuel assemblies with Pu require the involvement of expensive technologies during manufacturing. These three variants of the full core loadings can be balanced on zero Pu accumulation in the cycle. The various physical and economical aspects of Pu and U multiple recycling in selected variants are observed in the given work.

EXPADES consists of eight Delta(E)-E-res telescopes arranged in a cylindrical configuration around the target Each telescope is made up of two Double Sided Silicon Strip Detectors (DSSSDs) with a thickness of 40/60 mu m and 300 mu m for the Delta E and E-res, layer, respectively. Additionally, eight ionization-chambers were constructed to be used as an alternative Delta E stage or, in conjunction with the entire DSSSD array, to build up more complex triple telescopes. New low-noise multi-channel charge-sensitive preamplifiers and spectroscopy amplifiers, associated with constant fraction discriminators, peak-and-hold and Time to Amplitude Converter circuits were developed for the electronic readout of the Delta E stage. Application Specific Integrated Circuit based electronics was employed for the treatment of the E-res, signals. An 8-channel, 12-bit multi-sampling 50 MHz Analog to Digital Converter, a Trigger Supervisor Board for handling the trigger signals of the whole experimental set-up and an ad hoc data acquisition system were also developed. The performance of the PPACs, EXPADES and of the associated electronics was obtained offline with standard alpha calibration sources and in-beam by measuring the scattering process for the systems O-17+Ni-58 and O-17+(208)pb at incident energies around their respective Coulomb barriers and, successively, during the first experimental runs with the RIBS of the EXOTIC facility.

The RFT-30 cyclotron is highly complex and includes many signals for control and monitoring of the system. It is quite difficult to detect and monitor the system failure in real time. Moreover, continuous monitoring of the system is hard and time-consuming work for human operators. In this paper, we propose a support vector machine (SVM) based fault detection approach for the RFT-30 cyclotron. The proposed approach performs SVM learning with training samples to construct the classification model. To compensate the system complexity due to the large-scale accelerator, we utilize the principal component analysis (PCA) for transformation of the original data. After training procedure, the proposed approach detects the system faults in real time. We analyzed the performance of the Proposed approach utilizing the experimental data of the RFT-30 cyclotron. The performance results show that the proposed SVM approach can provide an efficient way to control the cyclotron system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
