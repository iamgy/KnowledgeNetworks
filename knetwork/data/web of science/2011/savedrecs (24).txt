The IPs; were exposed to ten specimens having a single plutonium particle. Photostimulated luminescence (PSL) images of the specimens were taken using a laser scanning machine. One relatively large spot induced by alpha-radioactivity from plutonium was observed in each PSL image. The plutonium-induced spots were discriminated by a threshold derived from background and the size of the spot. A good relationship between the PSL intensities of the spots and alpha-radioactivities measured using a radiation counter was obtained by least-square fitting, taking the fading effect into consideration. This method was applied to workplace monitoring in an actual uranium-plutonium mixed oxide (MOX) fuel fabrication facility. Plutonium contaminations were analyzed in ten other specimens having more than two plutonium spots. The alpha-radioactivities of plutonium contamination were derived from the PSL images and their relative errors were evaluated from exposure time.

Fresh UO2 fuel and spent PWR fuel have been employed in an electroreducer and, according to the pyroprocessing material flow, their metallic products are also evaluated correspondingly. TRU and Pu metals are evaluated concerning the electrowinner products. Totally, 6 kinds of reflectors and 4 stuffing materials are introduced to simulate the complexity during the pyroprocessing. With the optimized water intrusion models, certain subcritical data have been determined: 33.6 kg for UO2 fuel in electroreducer, 617.5 kg for spent fuel in electroreducer, 613.6 kg for metallic spent fuel in electroreducer, and 40.0 kg for U in electrorefiner. The conservative cases for electrowinner indicate the subcritical masses of 6.8 kg for Pu and 7.9 kg for TRU. However, with regard to the dilution effect of Cd, the Pu mass needed to reach the subcriticality changes from 11.1 kg with 1.2 kg of Cd to 500.0 kg with 2000.0 kg of Cd. The TRU mass needed to reach subcriticality changes from 13.0 kg with 1.4 kg Cd to 714.0 kg with 2856.0 kg of Cd. TSUNAMI has been employed to clarify the contributions of each nuclide quantitatively. The data obtained would therefore be used in the conceptual design study of pyroprocessing facilities.

The influence of pH, ionic strength, and the initial concentrations of Cs and I on the sorption of Cs and I on tuff and pumice isolated from the original pumice tuff rock was investigated. For both rocks, the proton concentration has little effect on the K-d values for Cs in the pH range 3-10. As the ionic strength of the solution increases in the presence of sodium perchlorate as a matrix ion, the K-d value of cesium apparently decreases, reflecting the competition of the electrolyte Na+ with the specific sorption of Cs+ on the negatively charged sites. In contrast, no significant dependence of ionic strength on the K-d of anionic iodine was found. A simple surface complexation model without considering electrostatic works was applied to simulate the sorption of ions on rocks, and the model parameters were determined. The K-d values at the given chemical conditions were estimated using the parameters and compared with the ones in the literature.

Consequently, the fuel elements are recovered as UO2 and PuO2. As a basic research of this new concept, the sulfurization and dissolution behaviors of U, Pu, Np, Am, Eu, Cs, and Sr were investigated by gamma-ray and alpha spectrometries in this paper using Pu-236-, Np-237-, Am-241-, Eu-152-, Cs-137-, and Sr-85-doped U3O8 samples. The dependence of the dissolution ratio of each element on the sulfurization temperature was studied and reasonably explained by combining the information of the sulfide phase analysis and the chemical thermodynamics of the dissolution reaction. The sulfurization temperature ranging from 350 to 450 degrees C seems to be promising for the separation of FP and MA from U and Pu, since a clear difference in the dissolution ratio between FP and U was derived by the sulfurization treatment in this temperature range.

PT diametral creep leads to diametral expansion, which affects the thermal hydraulic characteristics of the coolant channels and the critical heat flux (CHF). The CHF is a major parameter determining the critical channel power (CCP), which is used in the trip setpoint calculations of regional overpower protection (ROP) systems. Therefore, it is essential to predict PT diametral creep in CANDU reactors. PT diametral creep is caused mainly by fast neutron irradiation, temperature and applied stress. The objective of this study was to develop a bundle position-wise linear model (BPLM) to predict PT diametral creep employing previously measured PT diameters and HTS operating conditions. The linear model was optimized using a genetic algorithm and was devised based on a bundle position because it is expected that each bundle position in a PT channel has inherent characteristics. The proposed BPLM for predicting PT diametral creep was confirmed using the operating data of the Wolsung nuclear power plant in Korea. The linear model was able to predict PT diametral creep accurately.

In this study, the distribution of molybdenum in spent UO2 fuel specimens with 33.3, 41.0 and 57.6 GWd/tU burnup was measured by a LA-ICP-MS system and the reproducibility of the measured data was obtained. The Mo distribution was almost constant along the radius of a fuel except an increase at the periphery of the fuel. It showed a drop in reproducibility with relatively high deviation of measured values for the highest burnup fuel. To explain this, the state of molybdenum in a UO2 matrix and its effect on the oxidation behavior of UO2 were investigated. The low reproducibility was explained by the segregation of molybdenum, and the inhibition of oxidation by the molybdenum was also observed.

Internal spatial resolutions of sigma(x) = 88 mu m and sigma(y) = 38 mu m were achieved. The tracking efficiency dependence on ion beam intensity was studied with (238)U beam at 1 GeV/u energy. Efficiency of more than 99% was achieved up to 40 kHz and over 90% for 250 kHz (238)U beam intensity. Different kinds of ions from proton to uranium were measured in many experiments and confirmed the result obtained. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Noirot, L				Noirot, L.			MARGARET: A comprehensive code for the description of fission gas behavior	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							HIGH-BURNUP; PWR FUEL; IRRADIATION; UO2; DIFFUSION; POROSITY; BUBBLES; GROWTH	The relevant phenomena concerning stable-fission gas behavior in nuclear fuels are combined in a single model: MARGARET. This same tool can be used for base irradiations up to high burnup, ramp tests and annealing tests. The representation of intragranular or intergranular bubbles and fabrication pores is highly mechanistic. The partition of fission gas between these cavities and dissolved in the solid permits determination of swelling of the fuel. The released gas is obtained by difference between the created and retained gas in the fuel. The model has been validated against base irradiations, ramps and annealing tests of UO(2) fuel. The article presents the complete equations of the model in the base irradiation condition (Part I), followed by a detailed analysis of the behavior of a fuel irradiated up to 61 GWd/tU, extensively examined after irradiation (Part II). Part III presents the specific additional terms used for the calculation of transient and annealing conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Elemental analysis of cement used for radiation shielding by instrumental neutron activation analysis	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							CONCRETE	We aim to get the concentration of trace elements responsible of high radioactivity of a nuclear reactor shielding after removing the nuclear power station from service. These elements are activated by (n,gamma) reaction during the reactor service life. These elements are Ce, Co, Cs, Eu, Fe, Hf, Sb, Sc, Ta and Tb that normally present in concrete shielding especially in cement. Different Egyptian cement samples have been irradiated with neutron beam and analyzed with gamma ray counting system. It was concluded that the radioactivity from these trace elements play an important role after a long cooling time or reactor decommissioning. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Medhat, M.

Large Eddy Simulation and the effect of the turbulent inlet conditions in the mixing Tee	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							T-JUNCTION; FLOW	Thermal fatigue in Pressurized Water Reactor plants has been found to be very acute in some hot/cold Tee junction mixing zones. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) can be used to capture the unsteadiness which is responsible for the large mechanical stresses associated with thermal fatigue. Here one LES subgrid model is studied, namely the Dynamic Smagorinsky model. This paper has two goals. The first is to demonstrate some results obtained using the EDF R&D Code Saturne applied to the Vattenfall Tee junction benchmark (version 2006) and the second is to look at the effect of including synthetic turbulence at the Tee junction pipe inlets. The last goal is the main topic of this paper. The Synthetic Eddy Method is used to create the turbulent inlet conditions and is applied to two kinds of grids. One contains six million cells and the other ten million. The addition of turbulence at the inlet does not seem to have much effect on the bulk flow and all computations are in good agreement with the experimental data. However, the inlet turbulence does have an effect on the near wall flow. All cases show that the wall temperature fluctuation and the wall temperature/velocity correlation are not the same when a turbulent inlet condition is used. Inclusion of the turbulent inlet condition moves the downstream location of the maximum temperature/velocity correlation by 1 cm and reduces its magnitude by 10%. This result is very important because the temperature/velocity correlation is closely related to the turbulent heat transfer in the flow, which is in turn responsible for the mechanical stresses on the structure. Finally we have studied in detail the influence of the turbulent inlet condition just downstream of the mixing zone. We show the influence of including turbulent inlet condition on the structure of the flow Walker et al. (2009). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Ndombo, Jean-Marc; Howard, Richard J.

J	Roelofs, F; Hart, J; van Heek, A				Roelofs, Ferry; Hart, Jaap; van Heek, Aliki			European new build and fuel cycles in the 21st century	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								Nuclear energy is back on the agenda worldwide. In order to prepare for the next decades and to set priorities in nuclear R&D and investment, it is important to assess the future nuclear fuel cycle. This allows to identify the triggers which influence the market penetration of future nuclear reactor technologies. To this purpose, fuel cycle scenarios for a future nuclear reactor park in Europe have been analysed applying an integrated dynamic process modelling technique. The assessment was undertaken using the DANESS code (Dynamic Analysis of Nuclear Energy System Strategies, developed by Argonne National Laboratory (US)). This code allows to provide a complete picture of mass flows and economics of the various nuclear fuel cycle scenarios. The present assessment recognizes the integrated nuclear fuel cycle and concentrates on the evolution under consideration of increased uranium prices, increased costs for geological disposal, lifetime extension of the current reactor park, and various nuclear energy demand scenarios. The analyses show that the future European nuclear park will consist of a mix of Gen-III and Gen-IV reactors. The relative shares of the reactor types in the total mix depend on the applied boundary conditions such as the future nuclear energy demand, the reactor characteristics, and the assumed economical factors. Furthermore, the analyses highlight the triggers influencing the choices between different nuclear energy deployment scenarios, and enable an evaluation of future types and amounts of nuclear waste. In addition, a dynamic assessment is made with regard to employment of manpower for a future nuclear fleet in the different scenarios. Finally an estimate is provided of the radiological impact on the regional population due to the release of potentially hazardous radionuclides during the different steps in the nuclear fuel cycle.

The ARR is a 500 MW, (1180 MWth) oxide fueled sodium cooled fast reactor, which the low core height of 70 cm and the large structure volume fraction with 1.0 mm of cladding thickness to tube wall have been chosen among 14 candidate concepts to reduce the TRU conversion ratio (CR) and the void reactivity, taking technology readiness into account. As a result of nuclear calculation, the ARR has TRU burning capability from 19 to 21 kg/TW(th)h and is sustainable in recycling. And the ARR can accept several kinds of TRU; the LWR uranium oxide fuels, LWR-MOX used nuclear fuel, and TRU recycled in this fuel cycle and the ARR is also flexible in TRU management in ways that it can transform from TRU CR of 0.56 to breeding ratio (BR) of 1.03. In addition, it has been confirmed that the ARR core conforms to the set design requirements; the void reactivity, the maximum linear heat rate, and the shutdown margin of reactivity control system. It has been confirmed that the closed fuel cycle with the ARR plants of 180 GW(th) will not release TRU outside and generate more electricity by 65% compared with the present nuclear power system in the US, curbing the risk of nuclear proliferation. Thus the study can conclude that the Early ARR is able to close nuclear fuel cycle, using mature technologies and has features of the sustainability in recycling, and the accommodation of almost all the TRU at present and in the future, and the flexibility in TRU management with breakeven core.

J	Goncalves, OJA				Agostinho Goncalves Filho, Orlando Joao			INPRO economic assessment of the IRIS nuclear reactor for deployment in Brazil	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								This paper presents the results of the economic assessment of the International Reactor Innovative and Secure (IRIS) for deployment in Brazil using the assessment methodology developed under the International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles (INPRO), co-ordinated by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). INPRO initiated in 2001 and has the main objective of helping to ensure that nuclear energy will be available to contribute in a sustainable manner to the energy needs of the 21st century. Among its missions is the development of a methodology to assess innovative nuclear energy systems (INSs) on a global, regional and national basis. In 2005, Brazil submitted a proposal for the assessment of two small-size reactors as components of an INS, completed with a conventional open nuclear fuel cycle based on enriched uranium. One of the reactors assessed was IRIS, a small-size, modular, integral-type PWR reactor. IRIS was evaluated with regard to the areas of reactor safety and economics only. This paper outlines the rationale for the study and summarizes the results of the economic assessment. The study concluded that the reference design of IRIS complies with most of INPRO economics criteria and has potential to comply with the remaining ones. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Long operation life reactor for lunar surface power	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							PELLET BED REACTOR; SPACE REACTOR; SYSTEM; ALLOYS; IRRADIATION; PROPULSION; ABSORBERS; INTERNALS; REGOLITH; DESIGN	The Pellet Bed Reactor (PeBR) with an operational life of 66 full-power years is developed for lunar surface power. It has Inconel X750 structure and vessel and would be launched unfueled then loaded with spherical fuel pellets (similar to 1.0 cm dia.) on the lunar surface after being placed below grade and surrounded with regolith. The pellets, comprised of ZrC-coated UC particles (similar to 850 mu m in dia.) dispersed in ZrC matrix, are delivered to the lunar surface in subcritical canisters. The canisters are designed to remain sufficiently subcritical during launch and when submerged in wet sand and flooded with seawater in the unlikely event of a launch abort accident. The PeBR power system nominally generates similar to 100 kW(e) at a thermal efficiency of similar to 21% and a reactor exit temperature of 910 K. It employs three separate closed Brayton cycle (CBC) loops each with a turbo-machine unit for energy conversion and two water heat pipes radiator panels for heat rejection. The reactor coolant and CBC working fluid is He-Xe binary gas mixture (40 g/mol). Estimates of the hot-clean excess reactivity and the full-power operation life are obtained using neutronics and fuel depletion analyses. In addition, estimates of the total radioactivity in post-operation PeBR, while being stored below grade on the lunar surface, are determined for up to 1000 years. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Rani, RD; Sasidhar, P				Rani, R. Deepthi; Sasidhar, P.			Physico-chemical characterization of clays at Kalpakkam nuclear plant site towards assessment of radioactive waste disposal	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							FUEL WASTE; GROUNDWATER; COAL	In order to evaluate the safety of a radioactive waste repository in a geological formation, it is necessary to study the prevailing sub surface geology surrounding the disposal facility. The Kalpakkam subsurface was found to comprise of charnockite/hypersthene granite which is overlain by clay, sandy clay and sand. Clays can act as a barrier for groundwater flow and attenuate radionuclide migration. Accordingly, in the present study, clay samples were collected at chosen depths in the subsurface within the study area at Kalpakkam and colloidal clay fractions were separated. The clay colloids after separation were characterized for their size, shape, morphology, elemental composition and zeta potential. Photon correlation spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, X-ray diffraction technique and zetasizer were used to characterize the colloidal particles. The detailed characterization and analysis has revealed that the major clay mineral present in the subsurface at Kalpakkam is kaolinite. Minor quantities of smectite and illite were also identified in some clay samples. It was observed that the clays present in the study area are having low cation exchange capacity for radionuclides and emphasizes the requirement of proper backfill materials around disposal facilities for retardation of radionuclide migration. The occurrence of clay minerals at depths within the aquifer thickness warrants analysis of groundwater samples for suspended colloidal clay content. These suspended clay particles in groundwater have potential to transport of radionuclides in the ground environment along with groundwater flow depending on the nature of clay colloids and its zeta potential. Above investigations with respect to clay characterization would help the designer in incorporating the adequate safety measures in construction of near-surface disposal facility.

Gasemzadeh			Effect of gamma and lead as an additive material on the resistance and strength of concrete	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							ALKALI-SILICA REACTION; ATTENUATION COEFFICIENTS; RADIATION	Nowadays, concrete is extensively used for transporting, storing radioactive wastes and as a shield in nuclear planets. For this purpose, concrete must have a certain property like density in particular. Several of the specimens were produced to examine the effect of gamma radiation on compressive strength of concrete during solidification. The results show that the strength of gamma radiated concrete specimens has greatly been increased and it has been confirmed by perceiving their microstructure using scanning electron microscope (SEM). In another section, concrete is mixed with different percentages of lead to study gamma-ray shielding properties. By comparing obtained data from concrete specimens with and without lead, it was observed that, if the powder of lead with 90% ratio of lead-to-cement by weight is added in concrete mixture, the compressive strength of concrete reaches a maximum value and concrete can be a suitable shield against gamma-ray.

Deuterium ion-surface interactions of liquid-lithium thin films on micro-porous molybdenum substrates	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	18th International Workshop on Inelastic Ion-Surface Collisions (IISC-18)	SEP 26-OCT 01, 2010	Gatlinburg, TN			Lithium; Ion-surface analysis; Molybdenum; Ion-surface interactions; Liquid lithium diverter; Percolation		Lithium has been utilized to enhance the plasma performance for a variety of fusion devices such as TFTR, CDX-U and NSTX. Lithium in both the solid and liquid states has been studied extensively for its role in hydrogen retention and reduction in sputtering yield. A liquid lithium diverter (LLD) was recently installed in the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) fusion reactor to investigate lithium applications for plasma-facing surfaces (PFS). Representative samples of LLD material were exposed to lithium depositing and simulated plasma conditions offline at Purdue University to study changes in surface chemical functionalities of Mo, O, Li and D. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) conducted on samples revealed two distinct peak functionalities of lithiated porous molybdenum exposed to deuterium irradiation. The two-peak chemical functionality noticed in porous molybdenum deviates from similar studies conducted on lithiated graphite; such deviation in data is correlated to the complex surface morphology of the porous surface and the correct "wetting" of lithium on the sample surface. The proper lithium "wetting" on the sample surface is essential for maximum deuterium retention and corresponding LLD pumping of deuterium. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Retention and release mechanisms of deuterium implanted into beryllium	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	18th International Workshop on Inelastic Ion-Surface Collisions (IISC-18)	SEP 26-OCT 01, 2010	Gatlinburg, TN			Implantation; Deuterium; Beryllium; Retention; Desorption	HYDROGEN; IONS	The fraction of deuterium (D) that is retained upon irradiation of beryllium (Be) as well as the temperatures at which implanted D is released are of importance for the international fusion experiment ITER, where Be will be used as an armor material. The influence of single parameters on retention and release is investigated in laboratory experiments performed under well defined conditions with the aim to identify dominant underlying mechanisms and thus be able to predict the behavior of the Be wall in ITER. Recent progress in the quantification of retained fractions and release temperatures as well as in the understanding of the governing mechanisms is presented. The retained fraction upon implantation of D at 1 key into Be(1 1 (2) over bar 0) to fluences far below the saturation threshold of 10(21) M(-2) is almost 95%, the remaining 5% being attributed to reflection at the surface. At these low fluences, no dependence of the retained fractions on implantation energy is observed. At fluences of the order of 10(21) m(-2) and higher, saturation of the irradiated material affects the retention, leading to lower retained fractions. Furthermore, at these fluences the retained fractions decrease with decreasing implantation energies. Differences in the retained fractions from implanted Be(1 1 (2) over bar 0) and polycrystalline Be are explained by anisotropic diffusion of interstitials during implantation, leading to an amount of surviving D-trap complexes that depends on surface-orientation. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) spectra are recorded after implantation of fluences of the order of 10(19) m(-2) at various energies and simulated by means of a newly developed code based on coupled reaction-diffusion systems (CRDS). The asymmetric shape of the TPD peaks is reproduced by introducing a local D accumulation process into the model. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

While a-C:D structures evolve monotonically towards impact-modified surfaces, the graphite system exhibits layer-by-layer, cyclical modification and evolves towards a steady state different from its amorphous counterpart.

Towards Optimal Collimator Design for the PEDRO Hybrid Imaging System	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Compton scattering enhancement; multiple pinhole; PEDRO	COMPTON CAMERAS; RECONSTRUCTION; RESOLUTION; IMAGES	The Pixelated Emission Detector for RadiOisotopes (PEDRO) is a hybrid imaging system designed for the measurement of single photon emission from small animal models. The proof-of-principle device consists of a Compton-camera situated behind a mechanical collimator and is intended to provide optimal detection characteristics over a broad spectral range, from 30 to 511 keV. An automated routine has been developed for the optimization of large-area slits in the outer regions of a collimator which has a central region allocated for pinholes. The optimization was tested with a GEANT4 model of the experimental prototype. The data were blurred with the expected position and energy resolution parameters and a Bayesian interaction ordering algorithm was applied. Images were reconstructed using cone back-projection. The results show that the optimization technique allows the large-area slits to both sample fully and extend the primary field of view (FoV) determined by the pinholes. The slits were found to provide truncation of the back-projected cones of response and also an increase in the success rate of the interaction ordering algorithm. These factors resulted in an increase in the contrast and signal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed image estimates. Of the two configurations tested, the cylindrical geometry outperformed the square geometry, primarily because of a decrease in artifacts. This was due to isotropic modulation of the cone surfaces, that can be achieved with a circular shape. Also, the cylindrical geometry provided increased sampling of the FoV due to more optimal positioning of the slits. The use of the cylindrical collimator and application of the transmission function in the reconstruction was found to improve the resolution of the system by a factor of 20, as compared to the uncollimated Compton camera. Although this system is designed for small animal imaging, the technique can be applied to any application of single photon imaging.

Validation of a GATE Model of Lu-176 Intrinsic Radioactivity in LSO PET Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						GATE; minimum detectable activity; Monte Carlo methods; positron emission tomography; scintillation detectors	SCANNERS	The effects of the intrinsic activity of lutetium-based scintillators used in PET imaging such as LSO have been well documented and are not usually a concern in most in vivo situations. This activity can, however, become an issue when using a wide energy window or in low count rate scenarios as seen in cell trafficking studies in small animal imaging. To date there has been no systematic validation of Monte Carlo simulations that compare a model of intrinsic Lu-176 activity to measured data, making it difficult to include these effects in simulations of proposed scanners. This work seeks to validate a GATE model of intrinsic Lu-176 activity against results from a bench-top system of two detector modules from a Siemens Inveon preclinical PET system and also against results from a complete Inveon system. The bench-top measurements and simulations agree well in terms of both count rates and energy spectra, with small differences in the photopeak positions at 202 and 307 keV attributed to LSO non-proportionality, which is not modeled. Measurements and simulations for the full Inveon system exhibited similar discrepancies at low energies attributed to LSO non-proportionality as well as non-uniform detector triggering. For energy thresholds above 200 keV the simulation and measurements exhibited good agreement in count rates and energy spectra. Simulations are performed demonstrating the effect of the intrinsic activity on the minimum detectable activity for the Inveon system, demonstrating agreement with previously published measured results. The results demonstrate that this GATE model of Lu-176 activity can be used to accurately simulate the effects of this intrinsic activity in PET systems.

J	Conti, M; Eriksson, L; Hayden, C				Conti, Maurizio; Eriksson, Lars; Hayden, Charles			Monitoring Energy Calibration Drift Using the Scintillator Background Radiation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Detector calibration; LSO; PET; scintillator background radiation; scintillators	HRRT	Scintillating materials commonly used in nuclear medicine can contain traces of isotopes that naturally emit gamma or beta radiation. Examples of these are (138)La contained in LaBr(3) and other Lanthanum based scintillators, and (176)Lu contained in LSO, LYSO, LuYAP and other Lutetium based scintillators. In particular,(176)Lu decays into (176)Hf and emits a beta particle with maximum energy 589 keV, and a cascade of gamma rays of energies 307 keV, 202 keV and 88 keV. We propose to use the background radiation for monitoring of detector calibration drift and for self-calibration of detectors in complex detector systems. A calibration drift due to random or systematic changes in photomultiplier tube (PMT) gain was studied in a Siemens PET scanner, based on LSO blocks. Both a conventional radioactive source ((68)Ge, 511 keV photons from electron-positron annihilation) and the LSO background radiation were used for calibration. The difference in the calibration peak shift at 511 keV estimated with the two methods was less than 10%.

The aim of this work was to investigate the clinical feasibility and accuracy of PVE correction methods based on Recovery Coefficients (RC) as function of measured Lesion-to-Background ratio (L/B)(m) and measured lesion volume (V(m)). PET-CT measurements were performed. The radioactivity concentration (C(m)) and V(m) were measured from images using Operator-Dependent and Operator-Independent (OI) techniques. RC curves were obtained combining RC from NEMA 2001 IQ phantom measurements as function of Sphere-to-Background ratio (S/B)(m) and sphere V(m). PVE correction was applied to PET-CT studies of anthropomorphic oncological phantoms and to PET-CT oncological studies (basal and follow up). The underestimation of C(m) due to PVE in the NEMA IQ spheres (up to 80%) confirmed the severity of the error. The more feasible (always applicable, noise insensitive, reproducible) way to measure radioactivity was found by the use of an OI threshold technique. Our results showed that this measurement technique allows to achieve a PVE correction accuracy > 87% (error in radioactivity estimate < 13%) for a sphere diameter > 1 cm. In patient studies the PVE correction was found to modify both SUV and SUV variations during patient follow up and our analysis showed that a PVE corrected SUV quantification increases the diagnostic confidence of oncological PET-CT studies.

Monte-Carlo simulation results have been confronted to experimental data obtained from long-duration (>20 000 h) real-time measurements performed at the under-ground laboratory of Modane (LSM) and from experimental counting characterization using an ultra low background alpha-particle gas proportional counter. The calibration of simulations with the measured SER allowed us to determine a U-238 contamination level of 0.37 ppb (considered at secular equilibrium) in very good agreement with both corresponding alpha-particle emissivity levels measured and simulated at wafer-level in the range 1.1 to 2.3 x 10(-3) alpha/cm(2)/h.

Uranium and Thorium Contribution to Soft Error Rate in Advanced Technologies	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2010 Conference on Radiation and its Effects on Components and Systems (RADECS)	SEP 20-24, 2010	Langenfeld, AUSTRIA			Alpha particle; secular equilibrium; soft errors; thorium; uranium	NEUTRON-ACTIVATION ANALYSIS; ALUMINUM	(238)U and (232)Th and their relative daughters are impurity sources responsible for soft errors induced by alpha particles. In this paper, the contribution of each decay chain to the alpha emission rate is evaluated by assuming that secular equilibrium is reached. We show that for the same concentration of uranium and thorium in secular equilibrium, uranium decay chain has an alpha emission rate (AER) two times higher than the thorium decay chain. Furthermore, the contribution of these two decay chains to the Soft Error Rate (SER) and Multiple Cell Upset (MCU) is calculated for a 90 nm and a 65 nm CMOS technology by Monte Carlo simulations by considering a concentration of thorium 1.33 higher than uranium in secular equilibrium condition, which is representative to measurements found in literature. We show in these conditions that uranium has a contribution to the SER and MCU higher than that of thorium.

Verona			Development of On-Line Tritium Monitor Based Upon Artificial Diamond for Fusion Applications	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Nuclear measurements; particle measurements; radiation detectors; tritium		In this paper a novel on-line tritium monitor is presented. It is made with a single crystal diamond detector (SCD) covered with a thin layer of LiF 95% enriched in (6)Li. Thermal neutrons impinging on the LiF layer produce alpha and T ions which are detected by the active diamond. The pulse height spectrum shows two separated peaks due to alpha and T ions respectively. By a proper calibration in a reference thermal flux the number of (6)Li atoms and thus the absolute n +(6) Li -> alpha + T reaction rate per unitary flux can be established. Once calibrated the detector can be used to measure the tritium production. Due to the many outstanding properties of diamond this detector could operate in the harsh working conditions of a fusion breeding blanket. A test of this detector was performed at the 14 MeV Frascati Neutron Generator (FNG). The detector was inserted inside a mock-up of the European Helium Cooled Lithium Lead (HCLL) Tritium Blanket Module (TBM), designed to validate the neutronic database for fusion application. The mock-up of the TBM was designed to perform a full set of experiments to validate tritium production code prediction comparing the experimental results with calculations. The measured tritium rates with the Li-Diamond detector are described in this paper. Comparison with calculations is in progress and will be reported in a future paper.

Extension of the Linear Depth Attenuation Method for the Radioactivity Depth Analysis Tool (RADPAT)	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article							RADIATION DETECTORS	This paper relates to the determination of contamination depth in concrete media via the attenuation of radiation being emitted by the contamination. Previous research has shown that contamination depth can be derived by comparing the relative attenuation of the x-to gamma-ray photo-peak intensities of a given caesium-137 spectrum to that suggested by a derived attenuation model. Once given some initial calibration, a single cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) detector taking measurements over the surface of a concrete wall can ascertain the distribution of depth of the absorbed contamination. The work detailed in this paper provides the natural extension to the research on caesium so that it can be extended to other isotopes, such as cobalt-60. In particular the paper details the procedure used to obtain a new set of measurements which demonstrate that, whilst the method be applicable to obtain the depth of contamination for isotopes other than caesium-137, in the case of cobalt-60 it has important limitations. The CZT detector detector used for these measurements utilizes a bespoke pre-amplifier specifically matched to a CZT type detector. This device connects directly to a standard analogue signal processing chain, in stark contrast to previous measurement attempts where bespoke hardware was used. Therefore the output from the detector was of an inherently analogue nature which was supplemented by a digital oscilloscope when the measurements were taken; a step necessary due to the requirement that an instrument based on this method is portable. The oscilloscope, set to acquire at 500 Msps, logged data directly to a standard personal computer for subsequent analysis. This paper details the effect of the digital method and evaluates its performance on final result in comparison to the standard analogue technique. Finally, insight on the prototype design of an instrument based on this approach is provided which, by using the data obtained during the investigation, is calculated to require an embedded system based on a field-programmable gate array, capable of acquiring data at around 50 MSa/s.

MAGE is used to simulate the response of ultra-low radioactive background detectors to ionizing radiation, specifically the MAJORANA and GERDA neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments. MAJORANA and GERDA use high-purity germanium detectors to search for the neutrinoless double-beta decay of Ge-76 and MAGE is jointly developed between these two collaborations. The MAGE framework contains the geometry models of common objects, prototypes, test stands and the actual experiments. It also implements customized event generators, GEANT4 physics lists and output formats. All of these features are available as class libraries that are typically compiled into a single executable. The user selects the particular experimental setup implementation at run-time via macros. The combination of all these common classes into one framework reduces duplication of efforts, eases comparison between simulated data and experiment and simplifies the addition of new detectors to be simulated. This paper focuses on the software framework, custom event generators and physics lists.

Development of a High-Sensitivity Radiation Detector for Chromatography	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Chromatography; gamma ray detectors; positron emission tomography (PET)	CELLULOSIC BIOFUELS; PERFORMANCE; TOMOGRAPH	We describe a radiotracer imaging system for measuring the biochemical production rates of organic compounds from animals or plants. It uses a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column to separate the compounds and a parallel-plane radiation detector to measure the disintegrations from each compound over a period of time. Because the measurement time is much longer than conventional techniques, the sensitivity is greatly improved. This high-sensitivity radiation detector can be used to image radioactivity in the HPLC flow cell or column and can be used for a variety of analytical HPLC applications. The detector is comprised of 8 Siemens ECAT EXACT HR+ PET detector modules arranged into a parallel plane and read out with modified Siemens ECAT HRRT electronics. This high-sensitivity radiation detector was placed in line after a conventional HPLC radiation detector (a small CsI:Tl scintillator crystal coupled to a PIN photodiode) to allow a direct comparison. If we inject 9.3 mu Ci of [(18)F]FDG into the system, we see consistently shaped peaks with an excellent signal-to-noise ratio from both radiation detectors. If we inject only 5.4 nCi of [(18)F]FDG, we measure a signal-to-noise ratio of 28: 1 with the high-sensitivity radiation detector and 5: 1 with the conventional radiation detector. We have therefore achieved a sensitivity gain of 32 at low radioactivity concentrations using our high-sensitivity radiation detector compared to a conventional radiation detector. We believe that a high-sensitivity radiation detector, using parallel-plane PET detector modules, could become an important tool for analytical HPLC research.

TOKAMAK BASED HYBRID SYSTEMS FOR FUEL PRODUCTION AND RECOVERY FROM SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article							FUSION NEUTRON SOURCE; TRANSMUTATION	The effect of the internal elements of a tokamak with different coolants on the transmutation rate of long-lived actinides is studied. The Monte Carlo method is used to calculate nuclear reactions in a homogeneous model of a blanket and in specific designs of a blanket. The neutron-physical calculations of a homogeneous model of a blanket showed that the absorption of neutrons by the central column of the tokamak and their moderation by the beryllium coating slow the transmutation rate to 35% of the initial value with the most efficient utilization of lead coolant. For water coolant, this effect is negligible. In a heterogeneous model of a blanket where water coolant is used, plutonium must be added to the actinides (50%/50%). The use of lead as the coolant will increase the transmutation rate of the actinides without using plutonium. In this case, it will be possible to reprocess spent nuclear fuel from more than 10 VVER-1000 in the JUST-T hybrid reactor.	[Azizov, E. A.; Gladush, G.

Here, we study the effects of tritiated Thymidine ([(3)H] Thymidine) or tritiated water (HTO) contamination on the biological properties of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Materials and methods: Mouse HSC were contaminated with concentrations of [(3)H] Thymidine ranging from 0.37-37.03 kBq/ml or of HTO ranging from 5-50 kBq/ml. The biological properties of contaminated HSC were studied in vitro after HTO contamination and in vitro and in vivo after [(3)H] Thymidine contamination. Results: Proliferation, viability and double-strand breaks were dependent on [(3)H] Thymidine or HTO concentrations used for contamination but in vitro myeloid differentiation of HSC was not affected by [(3)H] Thymidine contamination. [(3)H] Thymidine contaminated HSC showed a compromised long-term capacity of hematopoietic reconstitution and competition experiments showed an up to two-fold decreased capacity of contaminated HSC to reconstitute hematopoiesis. These defects were not due to impaired homing in bone marrow but to an initial decreased proliferation rate of HSC. Conclusion: These results indicate that contaminations of HSC with doses of tritium that do not result in cell death, induce short-term effects on proliferation and cell cycle and long-term effects on hematopoietic reconstitution capacity of contaminated HSC.

Tritium Battery with Solid Dielectric	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							POLYETHYLENE TEREPHTHALATE FILMS; BEAM-INDUCED CONDUCTION; CAPACITOR	A tritium battery with solid dielectric has been built utilizing a tritium beta source, an electron collector, and a separating layer of dielectric much thicker than the range of tritium beta particles. Electric current between the electrodes is due to an electric field that is created by direct charge accumulation of beta particles in the dielectric. A macroscopic model describing the behavior of current and voltage is proposed. Based on this model and experimental results with 37 GBq (1000 mCi) tritium sources, the electrical characteristics of a device with 37 TBq (1000 Ci) tritium are extrapolated. It is predicted that this battery will have open circuit voltage over 6 kV, short circuit current more than 1 mu A, and 1 mW of electric power on an optimal load with overall efficiency near 9%.

Radon potential mapping of the Tralee-Castleisland and Cavan areas (Ireland) based on airborne gamma-ray spectrometry and geology	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article							INDOOR RADON; SOIL-GAS; HAZARD; HOUSE	The probability of homes in Ireland having high indoor radon concentrations is estimated on the basis of known in-house radon measurements averaged over 10 km x 10 km grid squares. The scope for using airborne gamma-ray spectrometer data for the Tralee-Castleisland area of county Kerry and county Cavan to predict the radon potential (RP) in two distinct areas of Ireland is evaluated in this study. Airborne data are compared statistically with in-house radon measurements in conjunction with geological and ground permeability data to establish linear regression models and produce radon potential maps. The best agreement between the percentage of dwellings exceeding the reference level (RL) for radon concentrations in Ireland (% > RL), estimated from indoor radon data, and modelled RP in the Tralee-Castleisland area is produced using models based on airborne gamma-ray spectrometry equivalent uranium (eU) and ground permeability data. Good agreement was obtained between the % > RL from indoor radon data and RP estimated from eU data in the Cavan area using terrain specific models. In both areas, RP maps derived from eU data are spatially more detailed than the published 10 km grid map. The results show the potential for using airborne radiometric data for producing RP maps.

Severe deterministic effects of external exposure and intake of radioactive material: basis for emergency response criteria	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article							INDUCED ABORTIONS; CHERNOBYL; IRRADIATION	Lessons learned from responses to past events have shown that more guidance is needed for the response to radiation emergencies (in this context, a 'radiation emergency' means the same as a 'nuclear or radiological emergency') which could lead to severe deterministic effects. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) requirements for preparedness and response for a radiation emergency, inter alia, require that arrangements shall be made to prevent, to a practicable extent, severe deterministic effects and to provide the appropriate specialised treatment for these effects. These requirements apply to all exposure pathways, both internal and external, and all reasonable scenarios, to include those resulting from malicious acts (e.g. dirty bombs). This paper briefly describes the approach used to develop the basis for emergency response criteria for protective actions to prevent severe deterministic effects in the case of external exposure and intake of radioactive material.

For this purpose, the radioactivity from three natural radionuclides was determined in tin process-waste samples in Jos, Nigeria. This work is based on the particle induced x-ray emission (PIXE) approach, devoid of the secular equilibrium, and most of the resolution, interference, self-absorption, geometrical and density correction problems inherent in gamma spectrometry. Many potential environmental hazards have been observed and the data would be of use to the government in its remediation plan for the study area. The high hazard indices require taking adequate measures to check exposures, and an underground lining in the waste ponds to prevent direct contact with the waste pile is recommended.

Evaluation of occupational exposure to naturally occurring radioactive materials in the Iranian ceramics industry	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								Zircon contains small amounts of uranium, thorium and radium in its crystalline structure. The ceramic industry is one of the major consumers of zirconium compounds that are used as an ingredient at similar to 10-20 % by weight in glaze. In this study, seven different ceramic factories have been investigated regarding the presence of radioactive elements with focus on natural radioactivity. The overall objective of this investigation is to provide information regarding the radiation exposure to workers in the ceramic industry due to naturally occurring radioactive materials. This objective is met by collecting existing radiological data specific to glaze production and generating new data from sampling activities. The sampling effort involves the whole process of glaze production. External exposures are monitored using a portable gamma-ray spectrometer and environmental thermoluminescence dosemeters, by placing them for 6 months in some workplaces. Internal routes of exposure (mainly inhalation) are studied using air sampling, and gross alpha and beta counting. Measurement of radon gas and its progeny is performed by continuous radon gas monitors that use pulse ionisation chambers. Natural radioactivity due to the presence of (238)U, (232)Th and (40)K in zirconium compounds, glazes and other samples is measured by a gamma-ray spectrometry system with a high-purity germanium detector. The average concentrations of (238)U and (232)Th observed in the zirconium compounds are > 3300 and > 550 Bq kg(-1), respectively. The specific activities of other samples are much lower than in zirconium compounds. The annual effective dose from external radiation had a mean value of similar to 0.13 mSv y(-1). Dust sampling revealed the greatest values in the process at the powdering site and hand weighing places. In these plants, the annual average effective dose from inhalation of long-lived airborne radionuclides was 0.226 mSv. (222)Rn gas concentrations in the glaze production plant and storage warehouse were found to range from 10 to 213 Bq m(-3). In this study, the estimated annual effective doses to exposed workers were < 1 mSv y(-1).	[Fathabadi, N.; Farahani, M.

Terrestrial gamma radioactivity levels and their corresponding extent exposure of environmental samples from Wadi El Assuity protective area, Assuit, Upper Egypt	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; BUILDING-MATERIALS; RADON EXHALATION; BY-PRODUCTS; RADIATION; TURKEY; SOIL; DWELLINGS; PAKISTAN; HAZARDS	Representative environmental samples (sandy soil, limestone, marble and gravels) collected from Wadi El Assuity, protective area, Assuit governorate in Upper Egypt have been investigated radiometrically using NaI (Tl) gamma-ray spectrometer. The specific activity of the radionuclides in Bq kg(-1) for soil ranged between 10.5 and 18.7 for Ra-226, 1.5 to 4.6 for Th-232 and from 94 to 107 for K-40, for limestone ranged between 19 and 27.1 for Ra-226, 32.9 to 50 for Th-232 and from 49 to 7 3 for K-40, where, for marble ranged between 12.2 and 30.7 for Ra-226, 32.6 to 59.5 for Th-232 and 55 to 70 for K-40 and for gravels ranged between 7.8 and 21.8 for Ra-226, 19.8 to 30.0 for Th-232 and from 151 to 260 for K-40. The mean activity concentrations of measured radionuclides were compared with other literature values. The absorbed dose rate, radium equivalent activity and external hazard index were calculated and compared with internationally recommended values. The gamma absorbed dose rates in the samples ranged between 8.44 and 50.89 nGy h(-1). These dose rates are consistent with the accepted worldwide average 55 nGy h(-1) for the public. All values obtained for radium equivalent activity are < 370 Bq kg(-1), which are acceptable for safe use. The calculated values of external hazard index obtained varied from 0.12 to 0.24. Since these values are lower than unity, one can say that the radiation hazard is insignificant for the population living in the investigated area. This permits the use of these materials sediments as building materials in any probable development projects at this area.

Spatial distribution of radioisotopes in the coast of Suez Gulf, southwestern Sinai and the impact of hot springs	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							NORTH-SINAI; EGYPT; DISEQUILIBRIUM; URANIUM; WATERS; CS-137	This work describes the concentrations of radioisotopes in soil, sediment, wild plants and groundwater in southwestern Sinai. The study area extends from Suez to Abu Rudies along the eastern part of the Suez Gulf. It included two hot springs: Ayun Musa and Hammam Faraoun. No dependence of (137)Cs concentrations on any of the measured sand characteristics was found, including calcium carbonate. The enrichment of (226)Ra in Hammam Faraoun hot spring was the most prominent feature. The (226)Ra concentration in hot springs of Ayun Musa and Hammam Faraoun were 68 and 2377 Bq kg(-1) for sediments, 3.5 and 54.0 Bq kg(-1) for wild plants and 205 and 1945 mBq l(-1) for the groundwater, respectively. In addition, (226)Ra activity concentration in local sand in the area of Hammam Faraoun was similar to 14 times that of Ayun Musa. On the other hand, the (232)Th concentrations were comparable in the two hot springs, while (137)Cs concentrations were relatively higher in Ayun Musa. The characteristics and radioelements studies support possible suggestions that the waters in the two hot springs have different contributions of sea and groundwaters crossing different geological layers where the water-rock interaction takes place.

NATURAL CONVECTION IN TUNNELS AT YUCCA MOUNTAIN AND IMPACT ON DRIFT SEEPAGE	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2009 TOUGH2 Symposium	SEP 14-16, 2009	Berkeley, CA			TOUGH model; nuclear waste; seepage	WASTE EMPLACEMENT TUNNELS; UNSATURATED ZONE; FRACTURED ROCK; FLUID-FLOW; NEVADA; TRANSPORT	The decay heat from radioactive waste that is to be disposed in the once-proposed geologic repository at Yucca Mountain will significantly influence the moisture conditions in the fractured rock near emplacement tunnels (drifts). Additionally, large-scale convective cells will form in the open-air drifts and will serve as an important mechanism for the transport of vaporized pore water from the fractured rock in the drift center to the drift end. Such convective processes would also impact drift seepage, as evaporation could reduce the buildup of liquid water at the tunnel wall. Characterizing and understanding these liquid water and vapor transport processes is critical for evaluating the performance of the repository, in terms of water-induced canister corrosion and subsequent radionuclide containment. To study such processes, we previously developed and applied an enhanced version of TOUGH2 that solves for natural convection in the drift. We then used the results from this previous study as a time-dependent boundary condition in a high-resolution seepage model, allowing for a computationally efficient means for simulating these processes. The results from the seepage model show that cases with strong natural convection effects are expected to improve the performance of the repository, since smaller relative humidity values, with reduced local seepage, form a more desirable waste package environment.

Within this concept, the role of the bentonite buffer is considered central. The aim of the study was to model the evolution of the final repository during the thermal phase (heat-generating period of spent fuel) when the bentonite is initially only partially saturated. There is an essential need to determine how temperature influences saturation and how both of these factors affect the chemistry of bentonite. In this study the Long-Term Test of Buffer Materials A2 parcel test at the Aspo hard rock laboratory in Sweden was modeled using TOUGHREACT code. The results focused on the following phenomena occurring in the bentonite: cation exchange, changes of bentonite pore water, mineral alterations, saturation, and pressure changes in bentonite buffer. The results show similarity with experimental data. However, the results are open to questions, and further study is needed to confirm the validity of the results. Differences between modeled and experimental results can be explained, for example, so that the experimental results are not from the fracture position as our one-dimensional model assumes.

SIMULATION OF GAS TRANSFER AT THE SCALE OF A DISPOSAL CELL IN THE CONTEXT OF HIGH-LEVEL AND LONG-LIVED RADWASTE DISPOSAL IN A DEEP CLAY FORMATION DURING THE OPERATING PHASE	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2009 TOUGH2 Symposium	SEP 14-16, 2009	Berkeley, CA			multiphase multicomponent transient flow; high-level and long-lived radioactive waste geological disposal; safety performance		The choice of the Callovo-Oxfordian formation in eastern France for construction of a proposed repository for high-level, long-lived radioactive waste (HLW) is based primarily on the low hydraulic conductivity of the clay-rich host rock. This property is also intrinsically linked to a low capacity of the rock to evacuate the significant amounts of hydrogen gas generated over time by processes such as anoxic corrosion of metallic materials and radiolysis of organic waste. The effects of hydrogen production on the be and safety performance of the disposal system components must be evaluated for the operating and postclosure periods of the repository. In order to do this, numerical simulations using TOUGH2-MP were performed on a vitrified waste (HLW) disposal cell and its access drift, for the operating period. The objective was to investigate generation and transfer of hydrogen within and outside the disposal cell, coupled with the desaturation of the access drift near field due to the combined action of drift ventilation and the coupled behavior of dry air and hydrogen within the disposal cell. Particular attention was focused on the form of hydrogen (expressed or dissolved), total gas pressure buildup, degree of gas saturation, gas transport pathways, gas concentrations, and gas exchanges between the disposal cell and the access drift. Simulation results show the validity of the conceptual assumption based on anoxic conditions in the useful part of the disposal system. The major part of the hydrogen comes to the access drift during the operating phase. Internal boundaries between interface zones and concrete lining are preferential pathways for the gas transfer.

It is necessary to forecast gas migration and pressure buildup in the context of deep geological radioactive waste disposal. One of the major problems in representing gas migration in a radioactive waste repository is that of simultaneously modeling all gas sources and complex transfer pathways constituted by the network of underground drifts and the surrounding low-permeability rock. In 2006, the French National Agency for Radioactive Waste Management launched an international multiphase flow simulation benchmark exercise for modeling such a two-phase (gas and liquid) flow system. The exercise was designed to compare the performance of the numerical methods being used to resolve the designed problems. This paper presents the results of test case 2 of the exercise completed by the authors. The three-dimensional model represents a fraction of a repository for long-lived radioactive waste in a clay rock. The model simulates ambient pressure and flow conditions (considering influence of site evacuation on the flow system) after placement of wastes, with full consideration of two-phase initial and boundary conditions. Isothermal conditions are assumed. Time-dependent gas sources are applied to the model. Since the natural environment is unable to evacuate the entire amount of hydrogen in a dissolved state, a free gas phase is formed within the disposal structures. The model is used to study the dissipation of those gases to determine their influence on the transient phases throughout the lifetime of the repository, and to investigate possible pressure buildup, which may introduce a risk of damage to the host rock. We use the model to investigate how the presence of gas in the repository influences the nature of water flow around the disposal structures and the resaturation (process of saturation increasing) transient processes after closure of the repository. The TOUGH2-MP code, a parallel multiphase flow simulator, has been adopted for this study.

A TURBULENT TRANSPORT NETWORK MODEL IN MULTIFLUX COUPLED WITH TOUGH2	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2009 TOUGH2 Symposium	SEP 14-16, 2009	Berkeley, CA			thermal-hydrologic network model; coupled MULTIFLUX and TOUGH2; nuclear waste repository	YUCCA-MOUNTAIN; EMPLACEMENT DRIFTS; CONVECTION; ROCK	A new numerical method is described for the fully iterated, conjugate solution of two discrete submodels, involving (a) a transport network model for heat, moisture, and airflows in a high-permeability, air-filled cavity; and (b) a variably saturated fractured porous medium. The transport network submodel is an integrated-parameter, computational fluid dynamics solver, describing the thermal-hydrologic transport processes in the flow channel system of the cavity with laminar or turbulent flow and convective heat and mass transport, using MULTIFLUX. The porous medium submodel, using TOUGH2, is a solver for the heat and mass transport in the fractured rock mass. The new model solution extends the application fields of TOUGH2 by integrating it with turbulent flow and transport in a discrete flow network system. We present demonstrational results for a nuclear waste repository application at Yucca Mountain with most realistic model assumptions and input parameters including the geometrical layout of the nuclear spent fuel and waste with variable heat load for the individual containers. The MULTIFLUX and TOUGH2 model elements are fully iterated, applying a programmed reprocessing of the Numerical Transport Code Functionalization model-element in an automated Outside Balance Iteration loop. The natural, convective airflow field and the heat and mass transport in a representative emplacement drift during postclosure are explicitly solved in the new model. The results demonstrate that the direction and magnitude of the air circulation patterns and all transport modes are strongly affected by the heat and moisture transport processes in the surrounding rock, justifying the need for a coupled, fully iterated model solution such as the one presented in the paper.

J	Perko, J; Weetjens, E				Perko, Janez; Weetjens, Eef			THERMOHYDRAULIC ANALYSIS OF GAS GENERATION IN A DISPOSAL FACILITY FOR VITRIFIED HIGH-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE IN BOOM CLAY	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2009 TOUGH2 Symposium	SEP 14-16, 2009	Berkeley, CA			high-level radioactive waste; coupled thermalhydraulic processes; temperature dependent		Assessment of gas generation and transport is inevitable for evaluation of the safety of nuclear waste disposal in deep geological formations. The long-term safety of the geological disposal facility is guaranteed by several engineered and natural barriers. The reference disposal concept in Belgium consists of a concrete-based repository situated in Boom Clay, which is a low-permeability plastic clay. Hence, the mobility of gas and liquid within these barriers is very small and may lead, in combination with increased temperatures due to decay heat of the waste, to pressure buildup and the potential structural failure of barriers. The focus of this study is on coupling two-phase water and gas flow with a heat source, originating from the heat dissipating waste. The main gas production mechanism within the considered geological repository system is (anaerobic) corrosion of metal barriers, generating H(2) gas. The corrosion process itself and therefore the intensity of the gas source is temperature dependent. Furthermore, the heat source is time dependent due to the decaying nature of the radioactive material. This property, in turn, makes the gas generation rate time dependent as well. The cases presented in this work couple variable gas generation with a time-variable heat source and are modeled with TOUGH2. Because of large uncertainties associated with the yet-uncharacterized engineered materials (e.g., concrete), two bounding material permeabilities with a span of two orders of magnitude are chosen for comparison. Results demonstrate that the peak pressures for the isothermal and non isothermal cases do not differ considerably in the case of high-permeability buffer material. On the contrary, the peak pressures differ considerably for low-permeability material, which hinders the flow of water induced by thermal expansion of water with temperature increase. This peak pressure is not related to the gas-generation process and occurs a little earlier than the gas pressure peak, which is in this case comparable to the high-permeability case. Overall, this near-field analysis showed that the effect of pressure increase remains relatively localized and should not affect the structural integrity of the host formation. The behavior of the system is additionally refined by the implementation of temperature-dependent hydrogen solubility within the numerical code, which slightly modifies the transition to H(2) gas phase.

NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF ATMOSPHERIC CARBONATION OF CONCRETE COMPONENTS IN A DEEP GEOLOGICAL RADWASTE DISPOSAL SITE DURING OPERATING PERIOD	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Transport of Unsaturated Groundwater and Heat (TOUGH) Symposium	SEP 14-16, 2009	Berkeley, CA			atmospheric carbonation of concrete; reactive transport simulations; radioactive waste disposal in deep clay layer		Simulations of atmospheric carbonation of concrete intermediate-low level waste cell components were conducted to evaluate potential chemical degradations affecting these components during the operating period of a radioactive waste repository in a deep Callovo-Oxfordian clay layer. Two-phase liquid water-airflow is combined with gas components diffusion processes, leading to a progressive drying of the concrete and an array of chemical reactions affecting the cement paste. The carbonation process depends strongly on the progression of the drying front inside the concrete, which in turn is sensitive to the initial water saturation and to nonlinear effects associated with permeability and tortuosity phenomenological laws. Results obtained with a modified version of ToughReact-EOS4 to represent realistic tortuosity evolution of materials with clogging and saturation are presented and commented upon. Strong porosity clogging of the carbonated concrete is not observed in the simulations; slight porosity opening is in general predicted, except for high initial liquid saturation of the concrete, in which case a moderate porosity reduction is found. Carbonation depths on the order of 0.6 to 1.1 x 10(-3) m.yr(-1) are predicted for cementitious components. However, these values are probably overestimations both in depth and intensity of carbonation. The model of cement drying needs some revision to correctly weight diffusion control in the discretized representation of the cement/air boundary. Also, the kinetic model of mineral reactivity needs improvements with respect to the influence of liquid saturation on reaction rates, which are actually strongly decreased in dry materials, and with respect to the protective effect of secondary carbonates.
