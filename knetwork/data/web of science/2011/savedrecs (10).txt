In a simple flowsheet of the Purex process including dissolution, co-decontamination, and uranium-plutonium partition processes, the measurements of the steady-state mass flow rate, which include artificial random errors imitating measurement errors and/or process disturbances, are reconciled by a least-squares method with linear constraints of mass balance equations. The reconciled measurements satisfy the mass balance equations and their random errors are reduced. By use of another set of measurements, which includes both random and systematic errors, the gross error detection with chi(2) test statistic is tested in order to find the systematic errors, which can correspond to the failure of measurement devices and the loss of nuclear materials. The systematic error is successfully detected with a given confidence limit.

MANAGEMENT OF TRITIUM IN ITER WASTE	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								ITER will use tritium as fuel. Procedures and processes are thus put in place in order to recover the tritium that is not used in the fusion reaction, including from waste and effluents. The tritium thus recovered can be re-injected into the fuel cycle. Moreover, tritium content and thus outgassing may be a safety concern, because of the potential for releases to the environment, both from the facility and from the final disposal (subjected to stringent acceptance criteria in the current waste final disposal). The aim of this paper is to present the measures considered to deal with the specific case of tritium in the liquid and solid waste that will arise from ITER operation and decommissioning. It concerns the processes that are considered from the waste production to its final disposal and in particular: the tritium removal stages (in-situ divertor baking at 350 C and tritium removal from solid waste and liquid and gaseous effluents), the removal of dust contamination (dust containing tritium produced by plasma-wall interaction and by the maintenance/ refurbishment processes) and the measures to enable safe processing and storage of the waste (wall-liner in the hot cell facility to limit concrete contamination and interim storage enabling tritium decay for waste that could not be directly accepted in the host-country final disposal facilities).

THE EUROPEAN SUPPLIED COMPONENTS OF THE ITER VACUUM PUMPING SYSTEMS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								The ITER Vacuum Pumping systems are designed to pump hydrogen isotopes, including tritium, helium and impurities. The EU is responsible for the in-kind supply of 8 torus-, 2 cryostat-, 3 Heating Neutral Beam- (HNB) and 1 Diagnostic Neutral Beam- (DNB) cryopumps, their 14 Cold Valve Boxes (CVBs) and the cryolines between them as well as the Leak Detection and Localization (LD&L) systems. The design of these systems has progressed well in the past with the exception of LD&L where the results of a significant R&D program are required to define the design. The torus and cryostat cryopumps incorporate an inlet vacuum valve capable of controlling the pumping speed and require to be sufficiently instrumented for performance and inventory control. In order to fully define the related Procurement Arrangements (PA) and minimize any technological, programmatic or cost risks, a 1:1 Pre-Production cryopump (PPC) has been planned to be built and tested as well as a series of necessary R&D activities will need to be performed. These activities will address all technological challenges, specify the instrumentation needs of these Vacuum Pumping systems and analyze their performance, incorporating also all safety provisions and remote handling requirements.

NIF is a 192- beam, Nd-glass laser facility that is capable of producing 1.8 MI, 500 TW of ultraviolet light, making it over fifty times more energetic than other existing ICF facilities. The NIF Project began in 1995 and completed in 2009. Ignition experiments using tritium on NIF have just commenced. Tritium arrives at the facility in individual fuel reservoirs that are mounted and connected to a target on the Cryogenic TARget POSitioner (TARPOS). CryoTARPOS provides the cryogenic cooling systems necessary to complete the formation of the ignition target's fuel ice layer, as well as the positioning system that transports and holds the target at the center of the NIF chamber during a shot. After a shot, unburned tritium is captured by the target chamber cryopumps. Upon regeneration, the cryopump effluent is directed to the Tritium Processing System, where elemental tritium is oxidized and captured on molecular sieve. Additional systems supporting tritium operations include area and stack tritium monitoring systems, local ventilation for contamination control, and a decontamination area that includes fume hoods and walk-in enclosures for working on contaminated components. This equipment has been used along with standard contamination control practices to manage the tritium hazard to workers and to limit releases to the environment to negligibly small amounts.

TRITIUM FACILITIES FOR THE LMJ CRYOGENIC TARGETS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							SYSTEM; LASER	Two major Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) projects are currently in progress. The US program at the National Ignition Facility (NIF), which has taken its first firing of a cryogenic target with DT fuel this year, mainly relies on cryogenic targets with capillary filled capsule [1]. For the French ICF experiments carried out on the Laser MegaJoule (LMJ), the nominal filling path of cryogenic target assemblies (CTAs) is permeation of DT fuel through the microshell 121 The CEA Valduc tritium facilities, where targets are filled, are thus original installations with specific designs and technologies. This paper deals with the description of the tritium facilities for the LMJ cryogenic targets (twelve gloveboxes are needed to deliver 6 CTAs at the same time). After a short presentation of the whole gloveboxes chain, the paper will focus on the heart of the plant: the filling and cooling station (IRCC: 4 gloveboxes). 3 out of 4 of these gloveboxes (LCCR, LCTC and LCPC) are at the moment under commissioning at the manufacturer's site. The last one (LCGC) has been delivered to CEA Valduc and is currently under testing with deuterium. A description of the IRCC design and specifications is given as well as the main results of the commissioning process.

TRITIUM AGEING STUDIES FOR "LMJ TARGET" APPLICATIONS: POLYIMIDE AND CHx MEMBRANES PERMEATION RESULTS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							FACILITIES	As part of the French Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) program, CEA has developped Cryogenic Target Assemblies (CTAs) for the Laser MegaJoule (LMJ). These targets are filled by permeation with high pressure deuterium-tritium gas mixture. The evolution of the materials physical properties, particularly organic ones (PI and CHx), which compose the target is unknown in these hard conditions. The polyimide and CHx membranes permeation was studied in this context. The hydrogen and helium permeation parameters are unaltered for polyimide membrane after tritium ageing in the 20 K - 300 K temperature range: K(He) = 3.10(-14) exp(-16040/RT) mol.m(-1).s(-1).Pa(-1) K(H2) = 2.10(-14) exp(-16050/RT) mol.m(-1).s(-1).Pa(-1) First results for the CHx hydrogen permeation parameters without ageing tritium have been obtained: K(H2) = 7.10(-13) exp(-10550/RT) mol.m(-1).s(-1).Pa(-1) New CHx permeation results after tritium ageing are shortly waited.

An inert gas containing a small amount of oxidizer flows in the small tubes oxiding tritium that comes from the primary liquid metal coolant. The tritiated water is sent to a tritium recovery system minimizing leakage to the secondary water loop. Our evaluation results indicated that the tritium leakage through the heat exchanger was reduced to 1/10(5) with an acceptable increase in the size of the heat exchanger.

THE BEHAVIORS OF TRITIUM AND HELIUM-3 IN CHINA DEVELOPED HYDROGEN RESISTANT STAINLESS STEELS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								To efficiently confine the gaseous deuterium and tritium, which are the important fuels in the development of fusion energies, China has developed a series of hydrogen resistant stainless steels, named as the HR series of stainless steels. The mechanisms of the interactions between tritium with the decayed helium-3 and these stainless steels were investigated by theoretical calculations, experimental observations or tests through gaseous tritium loading into the stainless steels and years of storage. Results showed that the China made HR stainless steels had good performance to resist hydrogen damage or hydrogen embrittlement. They are the ideal structure materials for tritium systems used in a fusion reactor like ITER. Nevertheless, tritium permeation at high temperatures are still high. Tritium permeation barriers with the aluminides on the surface of the components were successfully developed, which could greatly reduce tritium permeation flux down to 2-3 orders of magnitudes.

The evolution of lattice defects in long-aged titanium tritide films is also investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) over a period of about 1600 days (>4 years). And the thermal desorption (TD) has been used to investigate the (3)He release from titanium tritide film with (3)He/Ti atom ratio from 0.006 to 0.325. Results of XRD, TD and helium release were synthesized. A continuum-scale evolutionary model of helium for aging titanium tritide film is described which accounts for major features of the tritide experiment data. The combined stress-assisted-block loop punching growth for random bubble arrays and an average ligament stress criterion predicts an onset of inter-bubble fracture in good agreement with the He/Ti ratio observed for rapid He release.

A PROTOTYPE FOUR-INCH SHORT HYDRIDE (FISH) BED AS A REPLACEMENT TRITIUM STORAGE BED	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							PACE BED; ACCOUNTABILITY	The Savannah River Site (SRS) tritium facilities have used 1(st) generation (Gen1) metal hydride storage bed assemblies with process vessels (PVs) fabricated from 3 inch nominal pipe size (NPS) pipe to hold up to 12.6 kg of LaNi4.25Al0.75 metal hydride for tritium gas absorption, storage, and desorption for over 15 years. The 2(nd) generation (Gen2) of the bed design used the same NPS for the PV, but the added internal components produced a bed nominally 1.2 m long, and presented a significant challenge for heater cartridge replacement in a footprint limited glove-box. A prototype 3(rd) generation (Gen3) metal hydride storage bed has been designed and fabricated as a replacement candidate for the Gen2 storage bed. The prototype Gen3 bed uses a PV pipe diameter of 4 inch NPS so the bed length can be reduced below 0.7 m to facilitate heater cartridge replacement. For the Gen3 prototype bed, modeling results show increased absorption rates when using hydrides with lower absorption pressures. To improve absorption performance compared to the Gen2 beds, a LaNi4.15Al0.85 material was procured and processed to obtain the desired pressure-composition-temperature (PCT) properties. Other bed design improvements are also presented.	[Klein, J. E.; Estochen, E. G.; Shanahan, K. L.; Heung, L.

Based on the limitations to handle the tritium gas, the development of the tritium compatible pumps is restricted and the information of those is not well-known. Through Normetex scroll and metal bellows pumps, which are utilized in the tritium facility in the world, are famous tritium compatible pumps, the information has the limitations for the capability of those. It is needed to evaluate the performance of those experimentally. The non-destructive characteristics evaluation system for dry vacuum pump is utilized for the performance tests of the MB 601 HP and the combination of the Normetex 15 scroll and the MB 601 HP pumps. Nitrogen and helium gases are applied for the performance tests. In the case of the MB 601 HP, significant dependency is found on gas species: the test on the pumping speeds with using nitrogen shows the similar result with the catalogue data but the different behavior with using helium gas. In the case of the combination of the Normetex 15 scroll and the MB 601 HP pumps, however, it is observed that the effect of the species of gases is reduced.

MONITORING OF TRITIUM PURITY DURING LONG-TERM CIRCULATION IN THE KATRIN TEST EXPERIMENT LOOPINO USING LASER RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							DIATOMIC HYDROGEN; GAS; MOLECULES	The gas circulation loop LOOPINO has been set up and commissioned at Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK) to perform Raman measurements of circulating tritium mixtures under conditions similar to the inner loop system of the neutrino-mass experiment KATRIN, which is currently under construction. A custom-made interface is used to connect the tritium containing measurement cell, located inside a glove box, with the Raman setup standing on the outside. A tritium sample (purity > 95 %, 20 kPa total pressure) was circulated in LOOPINO for more than three weeks with a total throughput of 770 g of tritium. Compositional changes in the sample and the formation of tritiated and deuterated methanes CT4-nXn (X=H,D; n=0,1) were observed Both effects are caused by hydrogen isotope exchange reactions and gas wall interactions, due to tritium beta decay. A precision of 0.1 % was achieved for the monitoring of the T-2 Q(1)-branch, which fulfils the requirements for the KATRIN experiment and demonstrates the feasibility of high-precision Raman measurements with tritium inside a glove box.

There are many kinds of molecular species, conditions, amount, and concentration in the environment and it is desirable to have multiple ways of observation. Tritium is often found as hydrogen, water and methane molecules. Their behavior differs by the molecular species and detection of molecular species is therefore important. Near-infrared spectroscopy can be a good molecular species sensitive method for this purpose. However, since basic spectroscopic information of tritiated water (HTO or T(2)O) is unavailable, in this study we prepared tritiated water of high concentration, and carried out frequency modulation near-infrared spectroscopy. The tritiated water was synthesized by the oxidation reaction of 1 Ci of T(2). Near-infrared spectra at 1.3 micron were recorded. Many lines were observed which are not due to normal water. They are strong candidates of tritiated water spectral lines.

The IP made of europium-doped BaFBr(I), a photostimulated luminescence (PSL) material, is a two-dimensional radiation sensor. The PSL response of the IP has a peak at 20-50 keV and steeply decreases towards higher energy, falling by one hundredth at around 1 Me V. By utilizing a large difference in the PSL response to photon energy between (60)Co (1.173 and 1.333 Me and tritium (maximum energy of 18.6 keV), the bremsstrahlung X-ray induced by tritium beta ray was detected in mixed radiation fields with tritium and (60)Co, varying (60)Co dose rate in the range 0.0013 to 9.22 mu Gy/min. It was found that the effect of (60)Co irradiation to PSL value, obtained by irradiated with tritium of 12.5 MBq, was negligible by dose rate of 4.38 mu Gy/min and there was only 7.0% difference of PSL value, obtained by irradiated with tritium of 100 MBq, between dose rate of 0.0013 and 9.22 mu Gy/min.

CONTRIBUTION OF ELEMENTAL ANALYSIS AND UV-VIS SPECTROPHOTOMETRY TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF E-OBT ELIMINATION STAGE	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							SAMPLES; LEVEL	Tritium exists in environmental samples as: (0 Tissue Free Water Tritium (TFWT) and associated with the organic matter (OBT) under two forms; (ii) bound to oxygen and nitrogen atoms into the material (E-OBT); (iii) bound to carbon atoms into the material (NE-OBT). The analysis of the NE-OBT fraction requires the elimination of E-OBT prior measurement. This operation is generally performed through labile exchange supposing that only isotopic exchange occurs. Most of the time, the recovered exchange water are coloured indicating that other mechanisms arise. To identify and to understand these mechanisms, the combination of two analytical tools, a CHNS-O elemental analyser and a spectrophotometer was used NE-OBT analyses are performed on numerous environmental samples. In this work aliquots of those samples, under their solid form, were taken before and after labile exchange for elemental analysis purposes. In the same time the exchange waters were stored until spectrophotometric measurements. Solid analysis show that an evolution of the elemental composition could occur during the labile exchange with potential analytical impact. Moreover, it gives first ideas on which molecule could be solubilised. This trend is confirmed through spectrophotometric analysis where bands are observed for wavelength characteristics of proteins, amino acids, nucleic acids. Those preliminary results obtained using both techniques are promising but needs confirmation in the near future to determine to which extent an analytical impact could occur and to complete the identification of soluble molecules.

TRITIUM WATER MONITORING SYSTEM BASED ON CaF2 FLOW-CELL DETECTOR	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								For measuring the tritium concentration in water, a water monitoring system was developed. The monitoring system consists of a flow-cell detector, a pair of photomultiplier tubes, a circuit unit (including a high-voltage power supply and a coincidence counting module), a water flow pump and a multichannel pulse height analyzer. The flow-cell detector was fabricated using granular CaF2(Eu), which was solid scintillation materials. The performance of the water monitoring system was examined with three water samples containing different tritium concentrations of 10, 50 and 100 Bq/ml, and linearity between the count rate and the tritium concentration was examined. The results suggest that our system reasonably works as a water monitor for measuring low level tritium concentration. This system is the first such real-time monitoring system able to measure tritium concentrations in water continuously flowing through the solid scintillation detector.

OBSERVED AND MODELLED TRITIUM IN THE WETLAND ECOSYSTEM IN DUKE SWAMP NEAR A NUCLEAR WASTE MANAGEMENT AREA	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							ORGANICALLY BOUND TRITIUM; ATMOSPHERIC TRITIUM; PLANTS	The high mobility of tritium as HTO implies that, under steady-state conditions, the T/H ratio (or equivalently the HTO concentration) is the same in all water compartments of the environment. This is the basis of the specific activity (SA) model, which underlies almost all environmental tritium models. SA concepts apply to organically bound tritium (OBT) as well, since the OBT formed by a given plant process at a given time has a T/H ratio that reflects the ratio in the water that enters into that process. There is no empirical evidence that the bioaccumulation of tritium in aquatic and wetland plants will occur. OBT/HTO ratios less than one is consistently found in the laboratory where the HTO concentrations to which the plants are exposed can be held constant. These data suggest a value of 0.7 for the OBT/HTO ratio under equilibrium conditions in the laboratory. Theoretical considerations suggest that the value of the OBT/HTO ratio in plants is significantly different from one and, in most cases, greater than one. This is primarily due to the much longer residence time of OBT in plants as compared to HTO. The observed HTO concentrations are much higher than OBT concentrations, which makes OBT/HTO ratio smaller than unit in contrast with SA based expectations. In addition to this, the IMPACT model over-predicted HTO and OBT concentrations in plants and animals by a factor of 3 or 4, on average. This work is summary of the AECL funded research project (1).

IMPROVEMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SMALL CROSS-PIECE IONIZATION CHAMBERS AT THE TRITIUM LABORATORY KARLSRUHE	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							CONTAMINATION	At the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe stainless steel cross-piece ionization chambers have been used to measure the activity concentration of tritiated gases in experiments and processes for more than 10 years. New chambers with an optimized design in terms of the effective chamber volume were produced. Furthermore, they were gold and copper plated to determine the influence of the coatings on the signal and on the memory effect. A new chamber of the old design was built for direct comparison of the signals. The chambers were characterized with different helium-tritium mixtures in 8 runs and the ionisation current as a function of the static gas pressure was measured. When comparing the three new chambers, the gold chamber always showed the highest current, followed by the copper chamber. After exposing the chambers to similar to 13,100 TBq/m(3), the memory effect was investigated by using a similar gas mixture of the earlier runs with similar to 1,500 TBq/m(3). The gold chamber showed the highest memory effect, the copper chamber the lowest. This paper describes the design and the testing procedure of the chambers. It presents the first experimental results on the chamber performance, on the memory effects as well as calibration curves.	[Wagner, R.; Besserer, U.; Demange, D.; Dittrich, H.; Le, T. L.; Simon, K.

The usual methods to determine volumes have several disadvantages concerning contamination issues and accuracy. In this work a novel method is used to determine volumes. The method does not require any liquid or precisely known reference volume. It is simple and the uncertainty of the measurement is lower than 1% for volumes from 10 cm(3) to 10 dm(3). In this paper the principle of the volume determination device (VDD) designed and built at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK) is presented, together with a detailed uncertainty calculation.

And, the sample gas such as He, T(2), or T(2)(1%)/He mixture was introduced into the tritium gas monitor kept at 120 degrees C. Then, the counting rate was observed. The counting rate at 120 degrees C was about a half of that at the room temperature. The counting rate after the heating was almost same with that before the heating. So, the deterioration of the scintillator by the heating has not been observed.

ANALYSIS OF GASES BY RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY: DETERMINATION OF ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION OF HYDROGEN MIXTURES (H-2, D-2 AND T-2)	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								The Raman spectroscopy is a very attractive method for real time, in-situ process monitoring and control in a tritium facility. From the viewpoint of safety and inventory of the tritium, the Raman spectroscopy allows the content of tritium in different points on a process to be measured. It's a dynamic measurement with a short analytical period. Coupled with fiber optics, a Raman spectrometer allows on-line analysis of a tritiated process in a glove box with the spectrometer exterior to the glove box. This method should be applied to isotopic analysis of gas mixtures. The experimental results show that this technique is suitable for qualitative and quantitative analysis of tritiated gas mixtures.

RADIOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF TRITIUM FOR ITER TYPE B METALLIC RADWASTES	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							RADIOLUMINOGRAPHY	ITER is trying to develop destructive and non-destructive methods of tritium measurement for discarded radwaste components. The ITER Type B(medium activity with long life) metallic radwastes that need tritium measurement are mainly Divertor Cassette Body, Blanket Modules, Test Blanket Module Port Plug, Torus Cryopump, etc. It has been known that 10(7) Bq/g of tritium is distributed within 1 mm depth from the surface of the metallic radwastes. The metallic radwastes generated from maintenance period of ITER facility will be transferred to the Hot Cell Facility (HCF) for treatment including cutting, tritium removal and pre-packaging, followed by being shipped to the disposal facility after interim storage at ITER site. In this study, the radiochemical analysis methods of tritium measurement for ITER type B metallic radwastes were reviewed. Especially, two experimental methods, chemical acid leaching method (CALM) and heating method (HM,) were compared with each others to suggest the most suitable method for tritium measurement. The recovery yield of tritium standards for CALM and HM showed excellent results of 98 and 90 %, respectively. Since HM requires post treatment of extracted tritium species due to impurities, as shown in the analysis of sample from Nuclear Power Plant, CALM was considered more efficient method than HM for tritium analysis of Type B metallic radwastes.

EFFECT OF TRITIUM STORAGE VESSEL AND ALUMINUM SECONDARY CONTAINER ON CALORIMETER PERFORMANCE	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								A calorimeter was integrated in KEPTL (KEPCO Research Institute Tritium Laboratory) and the various performance tests were performed. The inventory of tritium transport vessels delivered to the ITER tritium plant will be measured by calorimetry. For calorimetry measurement the tritium transport vessel will be inserted in an aluminum secondary container for the tritium leak prevention. The heat capacity and geometry of measuring objects, however, can affect the performance of the calorimeter such as measuring time, sensitivity, etc.. In this study, the effect of the heat capacity of the tritium vessel on the performance of the twin cell calorimeter is studied by using JEC and aluminum container which are dummy vessels simulating the tritium decay heat with electric heaters. The average sensitivity in the test with aluminum containers is measured to be 96 mu V/mW which is similar that with JEC so it does not depend directly on the heat capacity of the tritium vessel. The aluminum container, however, makes the measuring time increase and the heat flow signal could be unstable in the range of low tritium and high heat capacity like a waste vessel after tritium loading out.

In this study, changing tritium concentration in lithium, tritium permeation through iron window contacting with tritium was quantified by ionization chambers. As a result, measurable amount of tritium permeated the window even though tritium concentration in lithium was in the order of wppb. The amount of tritium permeation increased as tritium concentration in lithium increased. Iron window is hopeful as tritium monitor for liquid lithium.

J	Kobayashi, K; Hayashi, T; Yamanishi, T				Kobayashi, Kazuhiro; Hayashi, Takumi; Yamanishi, Toshihiko			BEHAVIOR OF TRITIATED WATER ON CONCRETE MATERIALS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							TRITIUM; DIFFUSION; SORPTION; CEMENT; VAPOR	A fusion reactor requires high levels of safety and public acceptability, so safe confinement of tritium is one of the key issues. Tritium must be well controlled with no excessive release to environment and no excessive workers exposure. Especially, the hot cell and tritium facility of ITER will use various construction materials such as the concrete and the organic materials. Since the concrete materials will be contaminated by tritium compared with the metal materials such as SS, it is very important to study the tritium behavior on the materials from the viewpoint of the excessive exposure protection to workers. Therefore, in order to understand the tritium behavior on the concrete materials, the sorption and desorption experiment was carried out as a function of the exposure time and temperature of water in the desorption experiment. The used samples were cement paste, mortar and concrete. These samples were exposed into 740 similar to 1110 Bq/cm(3) of tritiated water vapor at room temperature. The exposed time was from a day to several weeks. The exposed samples for a certain period were soaked into water at 277 K, 298 K and 343 K, and then the water was periodically measured by Liquid Scintillation Counter (LSC) and the amount of tritium sorbed on the concrete materials were evaluated. The amount of the tritium sorbed in the concrete materials reached equilibrium less than 2 months. In the desorption behavior from concrete materials to water at 277K, 298K and 343K, the tritium sorbed in the concrete materials was desorbed about 99 % for 2 days at 343 K of water. However, the tritium desorption from concrete materials was sufficiently detected though 3 months passed. In addition, the tritium profile on the surface concrete materials was measured by a tritium imaging plate.

A MODEL FOR REMOVAL OF SURFACE-BOUND TRITIUM USING HUMID AIR	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							WATER	A model has been developed to describe the observed release rate of tritium from a research-scale laser inertial confinement fusion chamber during humid air purge cycles. The relative roles of successive rate limiting processes active during the purge cleaning process are assessed and incorporated into a system-level description that includes the coupled effects of convection, surface reaction, and sub-surface diffusion on tritium removal rate. The computational effort required for solution of the model equations is modest owing to the dominant roles of surface reaction and bulk diffusion, both of which may be adequately treated using low-dimension approximations. The resulting formalism is sufficiently general to be applied to a wide range of systems, materials, and process conditions involving water-gas interaction with tritium bearing surfaces.

IN SITU TRITIUM MEASUREMENTS AND CONTROL BY LASER TECHNIQUES	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							PLASMA-FACING COMPONENTS; TORE-SUPRA; ABLATION; REMOVAL	In this paper, in situ tritium measurements and control by laser techniques are presented. It is proposed to use Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) as an efficient technique to measure the tritium concentration in ablated material. However, LIBS could be limited due to material melting observed during ablation possibly leading to hydrogen losses. Laser ablation is shown to be an efficient process to recover the in vessel tritium if the dust produced during ablation is collected. This could be forbidden if ITER cannot be operated at high pressure. To overcome this difficulty and detritiate remote surfaces, laser heating could be applied since it generates gaseous compounds. However, inward diffusion could be expected leading to burry tritium in bulk material which is a counterproductive action. Finally, all these techniques must be embarked on remote handling system in order to explore and treat large surfaces. Obviously, this carrier is needed for a reliable and an efficient operation of the ITER nuclear facility.

UPTAKE AND DISTRIBUTION OF TRITIUM IN COPPER	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; SS316; RELEASE	The uptake of tritium on the surface and in the bulk of copper upon exposure to a 50 % T/H mixture at 300 or 473 K was investigated using a chemical etching technique. Concentrations of tritium approaching saturation are achieved fairly rapidly in Cu even at low temperatures because of comparatively high diffusivity and low solubility of hydrogen in this material. The results were interpreted by a diffusion model. Most notorious are the very high concentrations of tritium on the topmost surface and subsurface. They were quantified by etching and confirmed by BIXS. In addition, there is evidence for tritium trapping in the subsurface region. Tritium-loaded copper specimens release tritium chronically at ambient temperature. The egress of tritium manifests in the gas phase almost exclusively as tritiated water.

APPLICATION OF A HYDROTHERMAL TREATMENT FOR THE DECONTAMINATION FROM TRITIUM OF FUSION REACTOR MATERIALS-Tritium decontamination using an autoclave	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							TYPE-316 STAINLESS-STEEL; AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; THERMAL-DESORPTION; SURFACE-REACTION; SS316; DIFFUSION; TRANSPORT; HYDROGEN; RELEASE	A batch process concept for the decontamination from tritium of fusion reactor materials based on a hydrothermal treatment is under development at HRC. Essentially, tritium-loaded material is heated in a tightly closed vessel containing a defined amount of water. The objective of the water is to "capture" the released tritium in a small volume of liquid. For the detritiation, stainless steel temperatures in the range 393-473 K over a period of several days were found to be adequate. From the results it appears that by and large the released tritium accumulates in the purposely introduced water. The achieved degree of decontamination was estimated from the tritium concentration in the water and the tritium that remained in the decontaminated material. Tritium trapped in the surface layer of stainless steel was not reduced by the isochoric hydrothermal treatment in the same proportion as that in the bulk.

TRITIUM TRANSFER IN POROUS CONCRETE MATERIALS COATED WITH HYDROPHOBIC PAINTS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							BEHAVIOR	An experimental study on tritium transfer in porous concrete materials for the tertiary tritium safety containment is performed to investigate; (i) how fast tritium is transferred through porous concrete walls coated with or without a hydrophobic paint, and (ii) how well the hydrophobic paint coating works as a film protecting against tritium migrating through concrete. The experiment is comparatively carried out using two types of cement-paste and mortar disks with or without two kinds of paints. The results obtained here are summarized as follows: (1) Tritium transfer can be correlated in terms of the effective tritium diffusivity of D(T)=1.2x10(-11) m(2)/s in porous cement. (2) Adsorbed or condensed liquid HTO itself is transferred only through pores in cement, and no tritium transfer path is present in non-porous sand. (3) Rates of tritium sorption and dissolution in cement and mortar coated with an epoxy-resin paint is correlated in terms of the diffusivity through the paint film of D(T)=1.0x10(-16) m(2)/s. (4) The epoxy paint works more effectively as an anti-tritium diffusion coating than the acrylic-silicon resin paint. (5) The hydrophobic property of the silicon resin paint is deteriorated with elongating the contact time with H(2)O.

The Al(2)O(3) film prepared by in-situ oxidation of the iron aluminide layer is considered one of the most attractive because of the slow-growing steady protective oxide scale and its excellent self-healing ability. In order to obtain a transition aluminide layer with a certain aluminum content and thickness on two kinds of substrates such as the Reduced Activation Ferritic /Martensitic (RAFM) and 316L stainless steel, wide research efforts have been made on the effect of different pack chemistry, temperature and time on the properties and thickness of the aluminizing layers. The results indicated that a dense and uniform coating with a thickness about 20 mu m was formed on CLAM (a Chinese RA FM steel) and 316L substrates for the pack material with low Al content (about 32wt.%). This aluminide coating had a surface aluminum content about 40-50at.% and was mainly consisted of ductile FeAl phase. For the pack material with high Al content (about 50wt.%), the thickness and the surface aluminum content of the aluminizing coating had great increases and there were mainly brittle Fe(2)Al(5) phase. Especially some cracks were observed across this coating on CLAM substrate due to the mismatch in coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between the coating and substrate.	[Yuan, X. M.; Yang, H.

It is certified that recovery of tritium from the re-deposition layer together with suppression of the permeation loss through first wall and reduction of the total tritium inventory are elective to ease the tritium balance.

BETWEEN FUSION AND COSMOLOGY - THE FUTURE OF THE TRITIUM LABORATORY KARLSRUHE	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; ITER DESIGN; CYCLE; KATRIN; WATER	The original mission of TLK was the development of tritium technologies for the fuel cycle of fusion reactors. As a result of past R&D work TLK now has many similarities with the proposed ITER Tritium Plant. Because of its complete tritium infrastructure and its long lasting experience in tritium processing the TLK was chosen to host the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino experiment KATRIN. KATRIN will allow for model-independent measurements of the neutrino mass scale and thus should help to clarify the role of neutrinos in the early universe. The future of TLK is R&D 'between fusion and cosmology' based on its key competences, namely tritium technology and the closed tritium loop.

COMMISSIONING SCENARIO WITHOUT INITIAL TRITIUM INVENTORY FOR A DEMONSTRATION REACTOR DEMO-CREST	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								We discuss the applicability of the commissioning scenario without the initial tritium inventory to Demo-CREST. Analysis on MHD stability and current drive property (i.e., NBI injection power, its injection region, the driven current profile, etc.) makes clear the potential to start up the plasma operation without the initial tritium inventory. The critical issue on the core plasma operation is the high confinement of HH=1.57. We also discuss the tritium dead inventory in the plasma area. The key for the commissioning period without the initial tritium inventory is found to be the increment of the dead inventory. Finally, the required commissioning period is estimated at 75 similar to 110 days for the net TBR(DT)=1.05. That possibility strongly depends on the increment of the dead inventory, and understanding the tritium behavior not only in the plasma region but also in other tritium subsystem is important.

Out of the twenty plants, four are CANDU reactors at the Wolsong Nuclear Power Site. In the CANDU reactors, deuterium (heavy water) is used as a moderator and as the primary heat transport from the nuclear fuel. The nuclear research reactor, HANARO, in KAERI (Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute) uses heavy water as a neutron reflector. Tritium is formed by a neutron capture from the deuterium. If left to accumulate, tritium oxide would become a hazard to the operating staff and public. The primary purpose of a Tritium Removal Facility (TRF) is to reduce tritium concentration in a heavy water moderator. Operation of a TRF commenced at the Wolsong Nuclear Power Site on July 26th, 2007. Korea shared in the construction of the ITER fuel cycle plant with the EU, Japan, and US, and is responsible for the supply of an SDS (Tritium Storage and Delivery System). KAERI has been developing tritium technologies related to the Wolsong TRF, HANARO, and nuclear fusion fuel systems. We thus present details on the recent development status of the tritium systems.
