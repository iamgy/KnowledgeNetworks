ON THE FATE OF TRITIUM IN NICKEL	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 24-29, 2010	Nara, JAPAN				HYDROGEN PERMEATION; DIFFUSION; SS316; NI	Uptake, distribution, and release behavior of tritium in Ni was investigated by chemical etching and thermal release rate measurements. Liberated tritium was found to consist almost exclusively of tritiated water. The chronic release rate of tritium from Ni was significantly larger than that from type 316 stainless steel. Depth profiles in specimens that partially lost tritium due to its chronic release into vacuum, air or a stream of argon could be reproduced by a one-dimensional diffusion model using best fit diffusion coefficients. Values of the best-fit diffusion coefficients at 298 K were found to be independent from the ambient into which tritium was released. The average diffusion coefficient from all measurements at 298 K, i.e. (2.7 +/- 1.3) x 10(-1) [cm(2)/s] was in line with diffusion coefficients calculated from literature data at the same temperature. Hence, the diffusion model constitutes a useful tool for the prediction of tritium bulk depth profiles in Ni during chronic release (CR).

APPLICATION OF TRITIUM TRACER TECHNIQUE TO DETERMINATION OF HYDROGEN DIFFUSION COEFFICIENTS AND PERMEATION RATE NEAR ROOM TEMPERATURE FOR TUNGSTEN	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 24-29, 2010	Nara, JAPAN					Applying a tritium tracer technique, we have investigated hydrogen plasma driven permeation (PDP) through tungsten (W) near room temperature. The technique was confirmed to give reliable data on diffusion and permeation coefficients of pure W for gas driven permeation (GDP), and then it was applied to observe PDP in W near room temperature. It was found that PDP in earlier phase was controlled by diffusion giving reliable diffusion coefficients. Taking literature data at higher temperatures and present ones near room temperature determined from PDP into account, we have proposed new diffusion coefficients D(Upper) (limit) = (3.8 +/- 0.4)x10(-7) exp ((-39.8 +/- 1.5) (kEmol)/RT), m(2)s(-1). (1) The activation energy for permeation determined by PDP was similar to that by GDP. The extrapolation of the present data to higher temperature agreed well with Frauenfelder's data, suggesting the activation energy of around 65 kJ/mol for permeation is quite reasonable. However prolonged measurements resulted in significant reduction of PDP. The cause of the reduction was attributed to the increase of reemission owing to surface cleaning and/or roughening by incidence of energetic hydrogen.

Physically eroded carbons dominate a sharp profile on the outer target plate, whereas at the inner target plate, a very small redeposition is observed. Chemically eroded hydrocarbons produce a redeposition on the dome area as well as both inner and outer target plates. Assuming tritium content in the redeposited layers, tritium co-deposition profile on the inner and outer target plates and dome is estimated, which allows us to predict the long-term tritium retention in the divertor of ITER.

The rapid pressure drop of D(2) and the simultaneous pressure rises of HD and H(2) were observed during deuterium discharge. The net amount of retained deuterium was several times larger than that of stainless steel. The desorption of HD or H(2) was several times smaller than that of stainless steel.

THE EFFECT OF (HE)-H-3 ON LOW PRESSURE HYDRIDE ABSORPTION MEASUREMENTS WITH TRITIUM	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 24-29, 2010	Nara, JAPAN					Absorption isotherm data exists for a wide variety of hydrogen-metal systems. When working with high purity gases, appropriately sized equipment, and hydrides with equilibrium pressures above several hundred Pa, data collection is relatively straightforward. Special consideration must be given to experiments involving low equilibrium pressure hydrides, as even sub-ppm levels of gas impurities can generate partial pressures many times greater than the equilibrium pressures to be measured. Tritium absorption experiments are further complicated by the continuous generation of helium-3. The time required to transfer and absorb a known quantity of tritium onto a sample ultimately limits the minimum pressure range that can be studied using the standard technique. Equations are presented which show the pressure of helium-3 in a sample cell based on the amount of tritium to be absorbed, the sample cell volume and temperature, and the decay time of tritium. Sample calculations for zirconium show that at 300 degrees C, the estimated helium-3 pressure in the cell will be equal to the hydrogen absorption pressure after only milliseconds of tritium decay. An alternate method is presented that permits the collection of equilibrium data at pressures orders of magnitude lower than possible using a direct approach	[Staack, G. C.; Klein, J.

It has been shown that formation of the carbon deposition was suppressed at temperatures higher than 150 degrees C. However, a small amount of carbon deposition was observed even at a high temperature of 300 degrees C. From mass balance calculation, it was estimated that a majority of carbon decomposed in the plasma was transported to the vacuum pumping system.

SOLUBILITY OF TRITIUM IN Cu-Be ALLOY	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 24-29, 2010	Nara, JAPAN					Solubility of tritium in Cu-Be(2 mass%) alloy was determined by means of measurement of a tritium depth profile in the alloy. Tritium exposure to the samples was conducted under the following conditions: pressure, 0.4 to 2.6 kPa; temperature, 350 to 450 degrees C; exposure time, 4 to 11 hours. Tritium depth profiles were obtained by chemical etching otter the exposure. Remarkably high tritium concentration appeared in surface layers within 0.5 mu m, whereas almost constant concentration was observed from 10 mu m to the bulk. It was found, therefore, that surface tritium should be omitted in evaluation of the solubility of tritium. In addition, it was seen that dissolution of tritium into Cu-Be alloy obeys the Sieverts' law from the pressure dependence, and the solubility of tritium in Cu-Be alloy was lower than that in pure copper. From the temperature dependence of solubility, the heat of solution of tritium was determined as 17 kJ/mol.

Tritium Plasma Experiment is a unique linear plasma device that can handle radioactive fusion fuel of tritium, toxic material of beryllium, and neutron-irradiated material. A tritium depth profiling method up to mm range was developed using a tritium imaging plate and a diamond wire saw. A series of tritium experiments (T-2/D-2 ratio: 0.2 and 0.5 %) was performed to investigate tritium depth profiling in bulk tungsten, and the results shows that tritium is migrated into bulk tungsten up to mm range.

Tritium concentration in the oxide layers decreased with increasing Cr content due to reduction in concentrations of hydroxyl species and adsorbed water. In addition, release rate of tritium from Cr oxide layers was larger than that from Fe-rich oxide layers. It was concluded that preparation of thin Cr oxide layer is effective to reduce surface tritium contamination of austenitic stainless steels.

ABSORPTION AND DESORPTION CHARACTERISTICS OF HYDROGEN ISOTOPES IMPLANTED INTO STAINLESS STEEL BY GLOW DISCAHARGE AND BAKING	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 24-29, 2010	Nara, JAPAN				TRITIUM	Hydrogen isotope retention and its removal in/from a plasma-facing wall and structural materials have been recognized as key issues for fusion reactor from the viewpoints of operational safety and environmental preservation. Baking and/or a glow discharge are possible effective methods to remove hydrogen isotopes from materials. To investigate the absorption and desorption characteristics of hydrogen isotopes in structural materials, a glow discharge apparatus with twin chambers (Glow-1, 2) made with stainless steel was provided. The sample tip can be moved between the Glow-1 chamber and Glow-2 chamber without exposing it to the air. The controlled infrared (IR) heating device was installed in the Glow-1 chamber to heat the sample tip. Results of absorption and desorption by glow discharge, and the thermal desorption by IR heating are analyzed. No oxides of hydrogen isotopes were observed in these experiments. Most gases are retained near the solid surface and are desorbed at a low temperature below 150 degrees C. The activation energy was estimated to be about 50 kJ/mol.

After the membrane was heated to a required temperature, hydrogen plasma was discharged using a 2.45 GHz or 8.2 GHz RF system. Significant plasma-driven permeation was observed even for very short plasma discharges (e.g. 0.1s). Numerical calculations with the use of diffusion equation under recombination boundary conditions were conducted to simulate the transient permeation behavior. The numerical calculations were also used to estimate diffusion coefficient and recombination coefficients of membrane material. Temperature dependence of both the coefficients was explained by the Arrhenius law. A one hour long permeation curve was also numerically reproduced using the same set of parameters except an increasing recombination coefficient on the plasma side of the membrane.	[Sharma, S.

The samples of three different He-3 concentrations have been prepared for research approximate to 30, approximate to 80 and approximate to 19 0 appm. The buildup of He-3 has been fulfilled using tritium trick technique. The tests at room temperature have shown the increasing conventional yield strength (sigma(0.2)) and decreasing plasticity characteristics (total elongation delta(5) and reduction of area psi) depend on He-3 concentration increasing. However at 873 K test temperature the alloy with the maximum He-3 (approximate to 190 appm) concentration turned out to be more plastic than the alloy with He-3 approximate to 30 and 80 appm concentration.

Metal coatings such as copper, aluminum and gold plating of 10 pm thickness on outer surface of the F82H tube (250mm length, 10mm diameter and 1mm thickness) were prepared as the permeation reduction coating. Permeation Reduction Factor (PRF) of the metal coatings was evaluated by comparing the steady state permeation flux between metal plated specimens and F82H specimen. As the results, the PRF of the metal coatings at 590K were 5, 100 and >1000 for copper, aluminum and gold plating, respectively. Those results indicate the possibility that aluminum and gold plating could be applied in the tritium system as the tritium permeation reduction method.

The apparent deuterium permeability in the sample with FeAl/Al2O3 coating is an order of magnitude lower than that with natural oxide layer, and is at least three orders of magnitude lower than that in the non-oxidized material by inference. The apparent activation energy of deuterium permeation is 76.6kJ/mol for the coated sample and 61.3kJ/mol for the sample with natural oxidation film. The exponential dependences of steady flux for the samples on the pressure are 0.89 for FeAl/Al2O3 coating, 0.65 for natural oxidation film, and 0.55 for Ni-plating, that reflects different permeation mechanism for various surfaces. In addition, the trapping effect of defects on hydrogen isotope was inferred according to the different characteristic of permeation flux curves for various samples.	[Hu, Yong; Yang, H. G.; Zhao, W.

TRITIUM ABSORPTION OF CO-DEPOSITED CARBON FILMS, GRAPHITE AND POLYCRYSTALLINE TUNGSTEN	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 24-29, 2010	Nara, JAPAN				RAY SPECTROMETRY BIXS; HYDROGEN RETENTION; SURFACE TRITIUM; DIVERTOR TILES; ASDEX-UPGRADE; ARC-DISCHARGE; JT-60U	Tritium retention in plasma facing materials is a primary issue for ITER and next step fusion devices, since it greatly affects its safety and operational schedule. In the ITER, carbon and tungsten are used as divertor materials. In the present study, co-deposited carbon film, tungsten and isotropic graphite were exposed to tritium gas, and then the amount of absorbed tritium was investigated. During the tritium exposure, the partial pressure of tritium gas was kept at 10 Pa. The sample temperature was kept a constant in the range from RT to 573 K. The amounts of absorbed tritium were evaluated by beta-ray-induced X-ray spectrometry (BIXS). The amounts of absorbed tritium in co-deposited carbon films were one or two orders of magnitude larger than that of polycrystalline tungsten and isotropic graphite. The amount of absorbed tritium for co-deposited carbon film with a high volume density (1.53 g/cm(3)) was several times larger than that of the film with a low volume density (1.13 g/cm(3)). The amount of absorbed tritium increased with the temperature. These results indicate that co-deposited carbon films can absorb much larger amount of tritium than tungsten and graphite, and carbon film density affects the amount of absorbed tritium.

BEHAVIOR OF TRITIUM NEAR SURFACE REGION OF METALS EXPOSED TO TRITIUM PLASMA	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 24-29, 2010	Nara, JAPAN					In order to understand behavior of tritium (T) on surface and in bulk of metals exposed to T plasma, both surface activities and depth profiles of T were periodically observed by a tritium imaging plate technique during storage in air at room temperature (RT) for over 1 year. In the T depth profiles, T localized within a depth of sub mm from the surface was clearly distinguished from T in the bulk. The former was attributed to strong trapping by some defects produced by the plasma exposure and remained quite longer during the storage, while the latter was released from the surfaces by diffusion. T surface activity measured on the plasma-exposed surface changed in a complicated way with time due to removal of T by isotopic replacement with H in ubiquitous H(2)O and T supply from the bulk in the course of the diffusional release.

DEUTERIUM RETENTION IN DAMAGED TUNGSTEN	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 24-29, 2010	Nara, JAPAN				HYDROGEN	In this research, thermal desorption characteristics of deuterium retained at trap sites of W created by irradiation of 300 keV hydrogen ions have been studied. With 10 hours of annealing, about 85% of deuterium was desorbed at temperatures of 300 degrees C and 350 degrees C, while deuterium desorption at 250 degrees C was about 60%. To estimate trapping energy of trap sites in this damaged W, TMAP simulation was performed. The result shows that the trapping energy of 1.29eV well accounted fir the result of 250 degrees C annealing. In view that in the literature the vacancy trapping energy of hydrogen in tungsten was estimated to be close to 1.43 eV and the sensitivity analysis has given an uncertainty for the trapping energy of the order of 0.1 eV, it appears that the dominant trapping site type in the investigated damaged tungsten consists of vacancies.

IMPLEMENTATION OF TRITIUM PERMEATION MODELS IN THE CFD CODE FLUENT	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 24-29, 2010	Nara, JAPAN					A number of additions have been made to the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code Fluent in order to model hydrogen permeation. In addition to fluid dynamics, Fluent solves for heat transfer in coupled solid and fluid regions, and solves advection-diffusion equations for scalar quantities such as hydrogen concentration. The latter have been modified with additional code to satisfy Sievert's Law at solid-fluid interfaces and allow for temperature dependent diffusivity and permeability. The method has been employed to model the Tritium Heat Exchanger (THX) experiment at INL, which investigates hydrogen permeation in helium and candidate structural materials for high temperature gas reactor heat exchangers. The Arrhenius law parameters used in Fluent for Inconel 617 are initially determined via a simplified analytical method, and the resulting model predictions compare favorably with experiment data.

Dust collection in the vacuum vessel was performed after the experiment campaign, and the analysis showed that both weight and number of dust were large at the exhaust route of the deuterium gas under the divertor structure. Microscope analysis showed that small dust group (less than 20 mu m) had a statistical population, and that large dusts (larger than 20 mu m) contributed significantly to the total weight. Understanding of the properties of both small and large dusts is important to evaluate surface area for determination of fuel retention.

The interfacial layers, which were formed by the oxidation of the substrates, were found under the coating with different compositions and thickness according to the elemental depth profile of XPS. Their formations depended on the substrate materials (JLF-1: Fe-9Cr-2W based reduced activation ferritic/martensitic steel; SUS430: 18Cr based commercial ferritic steel) and the baking atmosphere (air or Ar). The main reason could be selective oxidation of main elements in the substrates at high temperature with the different baking atmosphere. For the coated JLF-1 samples, the surface smoothness and the hydrogen barrier performance of Er2O3 coatings were improved significantly by changing the baking atmosphere from air to Ar. The composition change in the oxidized interfacial layer from iron oxide to chromium oxide may be the reason for the improved surface smoothness and permeation barrier performance.

There is no significant temperature dependence of the radiochemical reactions in the temperature range from 373 to 573 K It has been found that concentration of such reaction products as tritiated methane and carbon monoxide molecules increases with time, whereas the concentration of tritiated water molecules remains practically constant. Additionally, influence of gamma-ray radiation on radiochemical reactions in H(2) and CO(2) gas mixture was examined. Water and methane molecules are formed as radiation products, however, carbon monoxide is not detectable.

OPTIMIZATION OF RADIATION PROTECTION FOR THE CONTROL OF OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE IN GHANA	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								Investigation of the optimization of protection of occupational exposed workers (OEWs) in Ghana had been carried out on the three practices in the country, namely medical applications, industrial radioisotope applications and research and education from 2002 to 2007. Mean annual effective dose and collective effective dose were estimated from dosimetry records from the Radiation Protection Institute of those occupationally exposed from 2002 to 2007. The mean annual effective dose estimated for about 650 OEWs per year ranged from 0.42 to 0.68 mSv compared with a global value of 0.5 mSv estimated by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR 2008 Report). This implies that efforts should still be made to institute as low as reasonably achievable culture in most practices in Ghana even though trend of doses incurred was low. The collective effective dose for this same period estimated ranged from 0.26 to 0.47 man Sv. A reference monetary value of the man sievert was estimated using the human capital approach for each year from 2002 to 2009; it ranged from 172 to 22 US $ per man Sv, which provided a basis for estimating the cost of averting a unit collective effective dose of 1 man Sv. This value could not be used for quantitative optimization since the range of mean annual effective dose estimated was below 1 mSv.	[Gordon, S.

BURNUP PERFORMANCE OF SODIUM-COOLED FAST REACTOR BY UTILIZING THORIUM-BASED FUELS	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						S-PRISM; burnup; transuranics		Thorium-based fuels are investigated to improve fast reactor fuel burnup. Such new sources of fuel will have to ensure that the projected expansion of nuclear power is achieved in conjunction with a reduced risk of nuclear weapons proliferation. Thorium fuel cycles have many incentives such as reduction of plutonium generation and consumption of light water reactor actinides, high-performance burnup, and conservation of (235)U resources. This study provides the insight needed to judge the limitations of the thorium fuel system. This work examines burnup reactivity loss and depletion analysis of thorium- versus uranium-based metal fuels. When compared, the thorium-based metallic fuel outperformed uranium-based fuel with respect to higher actinide burnup and higher depletion rate of plutonium isotopes. The results of this paper help ascertain the limitations based on the long-term performance and behavior of the fuel under core operating conditions. Additionally, the resulting knowledge gained and techniques developed during this project support reestablishing the domestic infrastructure in the U.S. fast reactor development program. The thorium cycle offers an alternative, innovative concept for fast reactor fuels to better burn transuranics, and this study provides test cases for comparisons between options.

MEASUREMENTS OF AEROSOL CHARGE AND SIZE DISTRIBUTION FOR GRAPHITE, GOLD, PALLADIUM, AND SILVER NANOPARTICLES	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							RADIOACTIVE AEROSOLS; FISSION-PRODUCT; BEHAVIOR; CORE; ACCIDENTS; ETHYLENE; REACTOR	The role of charge on aerosol evolution and hence the nuclear source term has been an issue of interest, and there is a need for both experimental techniques and modeling for quantifying this role. Our focus here is on further exploration of a tandem differential mobility analyzer (TDMA) technique to simultaneously measure both the size and charge (positive, negative, and neutral) dependent aerosol distributions. We have generated graphite, gold, silver, and palladium nanoparticles (aerosol) using a spark generator. We measure the electrical mobility-size distributions for these aerosols using a TDMA, and from these data we deduce the full charge-size distributions. We observe asymmetry in the particle size distributions for negative and positive charges. This asymmetry could have a bearing on the dynamics of charged aerosols, indicating that the assumption of symmetry for size distributions of negatively and positively charged particles in source term simulations may not always be appropriate. Also, the experimental technique should find applications in measurements of aerosol rate processes that are affected by both particle charge and size (e.g., coagulation, deposition, and resuspension), and hence in modeling and simulation of the nuclear source term.

J	Singer, CE; Von Brevern, H				Singer, Clifford E.; Von Brevern, Hermann			URANIUM PRICE VERSUS CUMULATIVE USE	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						resource sustainability; uranium supply; nuclear fuel economics		Formulas are given for extrapolating uranium prices that could result from future trajectories for the cumulative use of native uranium. The logarithm of the extrapolated price is given by a monotonically increasing trend curve plus a sinusoidal oscillation calibrated to historical data. The trend curve as a function of cumulative extraction of native uranium accounts both for accessing lower ore grades and for exploiting more-difficult-to-access richer ores as the more easily accessed richer ores are depleted. Accounting for both of these effects, the logarithm of the monotonic price trend is linear in the logarithm of cumulative extraction of native uranium, with least variance between observations and data of a power-law slope of 1/4.5 up to the point where a limit on the accessibility of the remaining highest-grade ores is reached. (However, a slope of 1/5.6 gives an almost equally good fit.) As an example, a ratio 4 of maximum depth of other mines to maximum depth of current uranium mines is used as a measure of the accessibility limit. This limit is first reached when the background trend curve uranium price reaches $143/kg of elemental uranium, in U.S. dollars inflation adjusted to year 2007 prices ($US2007). Thereafter, the accessibility limit gradually reduces the cumulative amount of native uranium extracted at a given cost below that computed from the power law, multiplying it by a factor of 0.59 when the trend price reaches 300 $US2007/kg. Increases of nuclear energy produced per kilogram of uranium mined with increasing uranium costs are also accounted for. A fraction of global nuclear energy users can develop a higher nuclear energy production rate per kilogram of mined uranium, e.g., by reusing the fissile material in spent fuel. Resulting cumulative cost changes as a function of cumulative nuclear energy use are presented in graphical and tabular form for a variety of input parameters.

SEPARATION OF TRANSMUTATION- AND FISSION-PRODUCED RADIOISOTOPES FROM IRRADIATED BERYLLIUM	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						beryllium; solvent extraction; decontamination	ACIDIC TANK WASTE; IONSIV(TM) IE-911; AMP-PAN; CESIUM; REMOVAL; STRONTIUM	The primary objective of this study was to test the effectiveness of a two-step solvent extraction-precipitation process for separating transmutation and fission products from irradiated beryllium. Beryllium metal was dissolved in nitric and fluoroboric acids. Isotopes of (241)Am, (239)pu, 85 sr, (60)Co, and (137)Cs were then added to make a surrogate beryllium waste solution. A series of batch contacts was performed with the spiked simulant using chlorinated cobalt dicarbollide and polyethylene glycol diluted with sulfone to extract the isotopes of Cs and Sr. Another series of batch contacts was performed using a combination of octyl (phenyl)-N,N-diisobutylcarbamoylmethylphosphine oxide in tributyl phosphate diluted with dodecane for extracting the isotopes of Pu and Am. The (60)Co was separated by first forming a cobalt complex and then selectively precipitating the beryllium as a hydroxide. The results indicate that >99.9% removal can be achieved for each radionuclide. Transuranic isotope contamination levels are reduced to <100 nCi/g, and sources of high beta-gamma radiation ((60)co, (137)Cs, and (90)Sr) are reduced to levels that will allow the beryllium to be contact handled. The separation process may be applicable to a recycle or waste disposition scenario.

We must be careful not to let this debate lure us away from capitalizing on the fruits of the project. One such fruit is a system for safely sealing packages containing radioactive nuclear waste. In March 2009, Idaho National Laboratory (INL) successfully demonstrated the Waste Package Closure System (WPCS), a full-scale prototype system for closing waste packages (WPs) that were to be entombed in the now-abandoned Yucca Mountain repository. This paper describes the system and components, which INL designed and built, to weld the closure lids on the WPs, nondestructively examine the welds using four different techniques, repair the welds if necessary, mitigate crack-initiating stresses in the surfaces of the welds, evacuate and backfill the WPs with an inert gas, and perform all of these tasks remotely. As a nation, we now have a proven method for securely sealing nuclear WPs for long-term storage-regardless of whether the future destination for these WPs will be an underground repository. Additionally, many of the WPCS's features and concepts may benefit other remote nuclear applications.

MEASUREMENT OF TRITIUM DURING VOLOXIDATION OF ZIRCALOY-2 CLADDING	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						tritium voloxidation; Zircaloy oxidation; fuel cladding hull	FUEL; OXIDATION; DIFFUSION; ZIRCONIUM; RELEASE; ALLOYS; AIR	A straightforward method to determine the tritium content of Zircaloy-2 cladding hulls via oxidation of the hulls and capture of the volatilized tritium in liquids has been demonstrated. Hull samples were heated in air inside a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The TGA was rapidly heated to 1000 degrees C to oxidize the hulls and to release absorbed tritium. To capture tritium, the TGA off-gas was bubbled through a series of liquid traps. The concentrations of tritium in bubbler solutions indicated that nearly all of the tritiated water vapor was captured. The average tritium content measured in the hulls was 19% of the amount of tritium produced by the fuel, according to ORIGEN2 isotope generation and depletion calculations. Published experimental data show that there is an initial, nonlinear oxidation rate for Zircaloy-2 followed by a faster, linear rate after "breakaway" of the oxide film and that the linear rate follows an Arrhenius model. This study demonstrates that the linear oxidation rate of Zircaloy samples at 974 degrees C is faster than predicted by the extrapolation of data from lower temperatures.

Interpretation of Fission Product Oscillations in the MINERVE Reactor, from Thermal to Epithermal Spectra	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article								To take into account the reactivity loss in spent fuels, an experimental program was set up in 1993 at CEA-Cadarache, France, oscillating separated fission products (FPs) in the MINERVE reactor. Reactivity worth measurements of small samples allow the extraction of information about nuclear data of the studied isotopes. A fully validated calculation scheme has been implemented to interpret pile-oscillation measurements. Therefore, calculation over experiment ratios can be accurately transposed to trends in the integral capture cross section of the FPs. With the European JEFF3.1.1 library, results show a discrepancy below 3% for several nuclides: Gd-155, Sm-149. 152, Nd-143, and Mo-95, but improvements may be needed for some others: Cs-133, Rh-103, Ru-99, and Eu-153. Based on the Integral Data Assimilation technique, we propose new thermal cross-section values, (348 +/- 14) b and (42478 +/- 1793) b, for two of the most absorbing nuclides, Nd-143 and Sm-149, respectively.

The Langevin Approach to Reactor Noise in Accelerator-Driven Systems	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							PULSED FEYNMAN-ALPHA; SUBCRITICAL REACTORS; EQUIVALENT SOURCE; DELAYED NEUTRONS; FORMULAS; FLUCTUATIONS	Reactor noise in accelerator-driven systems (ADSs) is different from that in critical or radioactive source-driven subcritical systems because of the periodically pulsed source and its non-Poisson character. In two earlier papers, we developed a theory of ADS reactor noise, incorporating these features. The non-Poisson character of the source does not permit the use of the forward Kolmogorov equation or the Bartlette formula, two commonly used techniques in traditional noise theory. The method used in these papers was a probability-generating function combined with the linear character of the reactor noise in zero-power systems. In this paper we develop the Langevin approach to reactor noise in ADSs. Apart from being simpler, the Langevin approach allows treatment of feedback effects arising in ADSs with significant power as well as other noise sources, if any. We demonstrate that it is possible to obtain the correct expressions for various noise descriptors using this approach. The method is then applied to treat correlated non-Poisson pulsed sources with a finite pulse width including delayed neutrons. The present paper complements and expands our earlier discussions of ADS reactor noise.	[Degweker, S. B.] Bhabha Atom Res Ctr, Div Theoret Phys, Bombay 400085, Maharashtra, India; [Rana, Y.

On Using Code Emulators and Monte Carlo Estimation to Predict Assembly Attributes of Spent Fuel Assemblies for Safeguards Applications	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article								The quantification of the plutonium mass in spent nuclear fuel assemblies is an important measurement for nuclear safeguards practitioners. A program is well underway to develop nondestructive assay instruments that, when combined, will be able to quantify the plutonium content of a spent nuclear fuel assembly. Each instrument will quantify a specific attribute of the spent fuel assembly, e.g., the fissile content. In this paper, we present a Monte Carlo based method of estimating the mean and distribution of some assembly attributes. An MCNPX model of each instrument has been created, and the response of the instrument was simulated for a range of spent fuel assemblies with discrete parameters (e.g., burnup, initial enrichment, and cooling time). The Monte Carlo based method interpolates between the modeled results for an instrument to emulate a response for parameters not explicitly modeled. We demonstrate the usefulness of this technique in applying the technique to six different instruments under investigation. The results show that this Monte Carlo based method can be used to estimate the assembly attributes of a spent fuel assembly based upon the measured response from the instrument.

Neutron Production from Proton-Driven Deuterium Gas Target	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							NUCLEAR-ENERGY GENERATION; WASTE TRANSMUTATION	Calculations of the yield of neutrons due to the interaction of protons on a deuterium gas target have been carried out for the primary p - d breakup reaction as well as for the secondary processes due to nuclear reactions induced by the elastically scattered protons and deuterons. The experimental conditions of Bowman et al. reported in a recent work were simulated with respect to the measurements of neutron yields in the proton energy range 7 to 17 MeV. It is found that the primary breakup reaction is the main source of neutron production and the contribution to the neutron yield from the secondary processes is quite small, being of the order of 1% to 2%. Thus, the discrepancy reported by Bowman et al. between the measured neutron yields and the theoretical calculations based on the primary breakup reaction alone cannot be explained by the inclusion of secondary processes. The possible reasons for the observed discrepancy are discussed. The calculations were extended up to E(p) = 100 MeV. The conclusion drawn by Bowman et al. regarding the energy cost per neutron at E(p) = 100 MeV by extrapolating the empirical function fitted to the experimental data measured up to 17 MeV is not borne out by the present calculations.

In the most extreme case, a 400 kW uranium beam of 200 MeV/u will be focused in a 1 mm diameter spot, leading to a power density of 60 MW/cm(3) for a C target. Up to 200 kW may be dissipated in the target. A rotating solid carbon disk concept has been selected as the target design approach for all primary beams up to uranium to provide high-power operation. A high rotational speed is necessary to compensate for the high power density. A multi-slice approach allows the evacuation of the large amount of heat deposited by the increase of the radiating area. In the present design study, the multislice target device has a diameter of about 30 cm and rotates at about 5000 RPM (revolutions per minute). The first step of the R&D strategy consists in the development and test of a 20 kW single-slice target prototype. This single disk device is designed to accept the same fraction of power as each disk of the final multi-slice target. Critical information on thermal-mechanical properties can be obtained thus at a lower power level than the one of the full device. Different carbon materials were tested. An electron beam of similar to 20 key was used for the thermal tests. Simulations were performed using the ANSYS code for the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the target, the resulting deformation and the stress profiles of heated graphite disks. Results of the simulations were compared with experimental data. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The target should withstand a goal beam intensity of 1 particle mu A (p mu A) (238)U-beam at 350 AMeV with a spot size of 1 mm in diameter, resulting in a heat deposit of 22 kW in the target. A beam-spot temperature monitoring system using infrared devices in high-radiation environment was elaborately developed. The beam-spot temperature on a beryllium (Be) fixed target and on a rotating Be and tungsten (W) disk target was measured with the most intense beams presently available at our facility. The heat deposit achieved was 0.6 kW, that is 1/37 of the goal value. At the present beam intensity, the result supports our estimation that a water-cooled rotating disk target of 30 cm diameter can withstand an approximately tenfold beam intensity compared to a water-cooled fixed target.

This 1Ci (252)Cf source will be housed in a movable shielded cask, from which it can be directly transferred into a large helium gas stopper cell. Within the gas stopper. the CARIBU (252)Cf source is positioned behind an aluminum degrader foil where the radioactive recoils of interest lose most of their energy before being stopped in the helium gas. To stop recoils over the full fission mass range effectively, three degraders of increasing thickness are required, one to cover the light fission peak and two for the isotopes in the heavy fission peak. The geometry of the source within the gas cell would ideally require a hemispherically shaped degrader foil for uniform energy loss of the fission products. The fabrication of a thin foil of such a shape proved to be exceedingly difficult and, therefore, a compromise "top hat" arrangement was designed. In addition, the ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environment necessary for the gas cell to function properly prevented the use of any epoxy due to vacuum outgassing.

Since 2005, the polymer-coated carbon foils (PCC-foils) have been fabricated at Nishina Center to prepare larger and thicker C-foils than those previously used as charge strippers. However, the multi-layer PCC-foils did not have sufficiently long life-time. Since August 2009, a new magnetron sputtering system is used to fabricate a thick C-foil. The foils coated with polymer are used as strippers. Life-times of the new single-layer PCC-foils under the uranium beam were measured in two configurations: at the first one a small piece of C-foil was attached to a fixed holder and in the second one a large C-foil was attached to a "rotating-cylinder stripper" device. The properties of the new single-layer PCC-foils and the results of the life-time measurements are reported in this contribution. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The actinide material of interest was first purified using ion exchange chromatography to remove any matrix contaminants or decay products present in the parent stock solution. The actinide solution was prepared in 0.05 M HNO(3) with a final aliquot volume not exceeding 100 mu L for the deposition procedure. The electroplating cells were developed in-house and were primarily made of Teflon. The source material deposited ranged from 125 to 400 mu g/cm(2). It was determined that multiple layers of U and Pu were required to produce thicker targets on Ti. Plating efficiency was greatly affected by the cell volume, solution aliquot size, pre-treatment of the foils, solution mixing during plating, and the fit of the electrode contact with the target substrate. The final procedure used for deposition is described in detail. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Henderson, R. A.; Gostic, J. M.; Burke, J. T.; Fisher, S. E.; Wu, C.

Experiments concerning the transmutation of radioactive waste are a central topic of the project. For this, large-area samples (>= 40 cm(2)) of (235,238)U and (238,242)Pu compounds are required for the calibration of fission chambers and for fission yield measurements. Another topic within the project requires large-area targets for precise measurements of the half-life, t(1/2), of very long-lived alpha-particle emitters like (144)Nd (t(1/2) approximate to 2 x 10(15) y). Here, we report on electrodeposition tests with Gd and Nd (used as chemical homologs of the actinides), which were performed to find optimal deposition conditions for small-area targets that should be applicable to future large-area targets. The layers were produced by molecular plating. A new stirring technique, ultrasonic stirring, was adopted and found to be suitable for producing large-area targets. Moreover, two different current densities (namely 0.7 and 1.4 mA/cm(2)) were studied and found appropriate for target preparation. Characterization of the layers with different analytical techniques played a major role in these studies to gain a deeper understanding of the deposition process itself: neutron activation analysis and gamma-spectroscopy were used for yield measurements, radiographic imaging for homogeneity studies, scanning electron microscopy for morphology studies, and atomic force microscopy for roughness studies. According to the obtained results, a new electrochemical cell for the production of large-area targets was designed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ion beams have potential uses in fields including heavy ion beam fusion, high-energy density physics and material processing. Intense heavy ion beams can generate high-energy density matter in the laboratory under extreme density and pressure conditions. Additionally, in heavy ion fusion, a stringent requirement for successful fuel ignition and sufficient fusion energy release is that the ion energy deposition profiles are calculated precisely in the energy absorber layer. In this work, the OK2 code was used to simulate the heavy ion beam energy deposition in various target materials, and a computer program was written to provide 3D visualization of the results. The heavy ion beams used in this work were composed of lead, uranium, and cesium ions with energies of 8 GeV and carbon ions with energies of 5 MeV. The targets included two shapes: a monolayer sphere that can be used in direct-driven fusion and a cylindrical shape that is common in indirectly driven heavy ion fusion. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
