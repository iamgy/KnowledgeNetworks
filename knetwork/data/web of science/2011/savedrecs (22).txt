During the experiment, the surface of iron piping was oxidized to magnetite at the heavy water boundary and then deuterium would generate by Schikorr reaction. This deuterium could be detected by mass spectrometer, which monitored the inside gases of the piping under vacuum. The result showed clearly that more than 85 % of the deuterium permeated through the metal piping and detected as deuterium gas (D-2) under vacuum. The D-2 permeation rate reached some stabilized value as a function of temperature.

Measured deposition coefficients were observed to vary with the mixing of water. It was shown by numerical analysis that when deposition coefficient was grater than 0.5, it could be expected that about 70 % of released tritium would be absorbed by water when release point was set on the sea and that when it was 0.15, about 40% of tritium would be absorbed.

Permeation models were constructed step-by-step by the introduction of the following predominant parameters: surface coverage, grain size, and energy barrier. The surface-coverage model agreed with the imperfectly coated samples fabricated by filtered arc deposition as well as by metal-organic decomposition. The grain-boundary-diffusion model also agreed with the coatings fabricated by filtered arc deposition, though it was not applicable to the metal-organic decomposition coatings because of impurities and different layer structures. The energy-barrier model explains the contributions to the additional permeation reduction of the multilayer coatings. The discussion of permeation models provides new design concepts for the development of tritium permeation barriers.

From the ESR spectra, gamma-ray irradiation induced irradiation defects such as E'-centers, oxygen-hole centers which were expected to be tritium trapping sites. These irradiation defects were annihilated in the temperature range of 500-650 K. From the TDS spectra for Li2TiO3 exposed to D-2 gas, the deuterium desorption behavior was found to consist of four stages, corresponding retention as the surface, in E'-center and as hydroxides bound with Ti or Li. In addition, most of deuterium was released as water form around 400, 550 and 650K. By comparison of the amounts of the deuterium retentions with or without the gamma-ray irradiation, the retention of deuterium trapped with the irradiation defects was increased by gamma-ray irradiation, indicating that the irradiation defects like E-'centers induced by gamma-ray irradiation would be one of the tritium trapping sites in tritium breeding materials. The activation energy of hydrogen isotope desorption from the E'-center was estimated to be 0.63 eV for gamma-ray irradiated Li2TiO3, showing good agreement with that of the recombination reaction between the E'-center and the oxygen-hole center. These results indicated that the tritium desorption was governed by the annihilation of the E'-centers.

The deuterium retention was increased as the oxidation temperature increased. It was considered that the thickness of oxide layer would make a large influence on the retention of hydrogen isotopes. On the other hand, the amount of released deuterium as heavy water (D2O) was independent with oxidation temperature.

This study was carried out for about 40% impurities-containing boron films. It was found that a major chemical state of carbon was C-B bond and that of oxygen was free oxygen for the carbon-oxygen containing boron films. Most of deuterium was trapped by the C-B bond to form a B-C-D bond. On the other hand, free oxygen formed heavy water (D(2)O) and released as D(2)O during deuterium implantation. The amount of deuterium trapped by carbon was increased as the carbon concentration increased. However, the deuterium retention for the carbon-oxygen containing boron film with less than 20% carbon was almost twice as high as that for the only about 20% carbon-containing boron films. It was also indicated that the formation of free carbon was refrained due to the existence of free oxygen which induce the increase of C-B bond in about 40% impurities-containing boron films. These results indicate that hydrogen isotopes were trapped as B-C-D bond, which released deuterium at 900 K, in lower carbon concentration as oxygen coexists with carbon in the boron films. It was concluded that impurity concentration should be kept as low as possible to prevent tritium retention in the boron film deposited on the first wall in future fusion devices.

Thus, the cryogenic adsorption method is considered to be applied to the recovery of tritium from the blanket sweep gas which recovers tritium from ceramic breeder materials, the cleanup system of the helium discharge exhaust gas of the fusion reactor and so forth. The authors performed a screening test to find more suitable adsorbents for the recovery of hydrogen isotopes from the bulk helium gas at liquid nitrogen temperature. The authors tested various adsorbents, and the screening test indicates that a natural mordenite adsorbent has a quite high adsorption capacity for hydrogen under the helium atmosphere. For the adsorption of deuterium, it was found that the natural mordenite adsorbent have a high adsorption capacity even at lower pressure range of deuterium. The adsorption rate of hydrogen isotopes was quantified by analyzing breakthrough curves obtained in the experiments. Evaluated effective pore diffusivities of hydrogen isotopes in the mordenite adsorbents are comparable to that in MS5A adsorbents. Thus, it can be said that mordenite adsorbents are also suitable for adsorption of hydrogen isotopes from the viewpoint of adsorption rates. The results mentioned above suggest that the mordenite-type of adsorbents is promising for the recovery of low-concentration hydrogen isotopes from the helium bulk gas.

In order to maximize the neutron yield, finding the dependence of clusters size and their spatial distribution on the experimental conditions has become very important. In this paper, we analyze the possibility of measuring the spatial distributions of deuterium clusters experimentally by using the complex interferometry diagnostics. For this purpose, close-to-reality computer-generated interfero-grams were produced, which included a small phase-shift disturbance modeling the clusters. Subsequent analysis of these interferograms provided results that identified this diagnostics as potentially suitable for such measurements.

Modelling the erosion of beryllium carbide surfaces	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; PLASMA; ITER; SIMULATION; TRANSPORT; SOLIDS; CARBON; CODE	Redeposition of beryllium eroded from main chamber plasma facing components of ITER onto the divertor material carbon creates a mixed material, beryllium carbide Be2C, whose interaction with the plasma is not well known. In this study, we have investigated the erosion of Be2C by deuterium using molecular dynamics simulations and ERO impurity modelling. We found that beryllium sputters preferentially over carbon and identified the sputtering mechanism in the ion energy range 10-100 eV to be both physical and swift chemical sputtering. In addition to single atoms, different types of small molecules/clusters were sputtered, the most frequently occurring molecules being BeD, Be2D, and CD. The sputtering threshold was found to lie between 10 and 15 eV. The MD sputtering yields were used in plasma impurity simulations, serving as a replacement for input data obtained with TRIM. This changes the accumulation rate of impurity Be in the divertor region compared to previous estimates. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recovery of actinides from actinide-aluminium alloys by chlorination: Part I	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							FUEL	Pyrochemical processes in molten LiCl-KCl are being developed in ITU for recovery of actinides from spent nuclear fuel. The fuel is anodically dissolved to the molten salt electrolyte and actinides are electrochemically reduced on solid aluminium cathodes forming solid actinide-aluminium alloys. A chlorination route is being investigated for recovery of actinides from the alloys. This route consists in three steps: Vacuum distillation for removal of the salt adhered on the electrode, chlorination of the actinide-aluminium alloys by chlorine gas and sublimation of the formed AlCl(3). A thermochemical study showed thermodynamic feasibility of all three steps. On the basis of the conditions identified by the calculations, experiments using pure UAl(3) alloy were carried out to evaluate and optimise the chlorination step. The work was focused on determination of the optimal temperature and Cl(2)/UAl(3) molar ratio, providing complete chlorination of the alloy without formation of volatile UCl(5) and UCl(6). The results showed high efficient chlorination at a temperature of 150 degrees C. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This has been proven by opening individual blisters with a focused ion beam and in situ observation of their complete relaxation by scanning electron microscopy. The D-2 gas filling is confirmed by observing simultaneously the D-2 puff. The gas pressure is causal for the stability of such spherical blisters after implantation and the gas release leads to sudden relaxation. The dilatation of the blister cap by trapped D can be excluded as cause for the blisters. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

THE WEATHER DEPENDENCE OF PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION OF INDOOR RADIOACTIVE AEROSOL ASSOCIATED WITH RADON DECAY PRODUCTS	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							PROGENY	This study was performed to measure the activity size distribution of aerosol particles associated with short-lived radon decay products in indoor air at Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan. The measurements were performed using a low pressure Andersen cascade impactor under variable meteorological conditions. The results showed that the greatest activity fraction was associated with aerosol particles in the accumulation size range (100-1000 nm) with a small fraction of nucleation mode (10-100 nm). Regarding the influence of the weather conditions, the decrease in the number of accumulation particles was observed clearly after rainfall without significant change in nucleation particles, which may be due to a washout process for the large particles.

In order to optimize design of a greenhouse, a numerical analysis was made by using the Flow Designer software. As a scenario of air contamination, the breathing air of the patient was assumed to be highly contaminated with radioactive gaseous or particulate matter. It was found that air contamination strongly depended on the characteristics of the contaminants. The contamination map of the coarse aerosols with low diffusivity was quite different from those of the fine aerosols and gas. If the setting conditions of air-flow rate of the ventilation and the exhausting position were optimized, secondary contamination of the medical staff standing by the patient is prevented securely by a greenhouse.

Time intervals between Bi-214 (beta) and Po-214 (alpha) are much shorter than artificial radionuclides due to the short half-life of Po-214 (164 mu s). The purpose of this study is to develop of a new analytical method (time interval analysis: TIA) based on the beta-alpha coincidence method for selective measurement of Bi-214-Po-214. The developed method was applied to an actual dust-filter measurement. The TIA system was highly effective in measuring of the filter with background subtraction.

The effective detection distance, the detection efficiency and the minimum detectable activity concentration (MDAC) for artificial radionuclides (137)Cs were worked out as an instance. Similar researches for NaI detector was also implemented for comparison. The results indicate that the self-activity in LaBr deteriorates the MDAC to merely several times of that of NaI detector. The LaBr detector is possible to be used as in situ gamma-ray spectrometer for monitoring of artificial radionuclides in seawater.

Several radiological accident and incidents happened in the past 10 y. A serious one was the radiological accident that occurred in Samut Prakan, Thailand in 2000. The serious radiological accident occurred when the (60)Co head was partially dismantled, taken from that storage to sell as scrap metal. Three victims died and 10 people received high dose from the source. The lesson learned from the radiological accident in Samut Prakan was to improve in many subjects, such as efficiency in Ministerial Regulations and Atomic Energy Act, emergency response and etc. In addition to the serious accident, there are also some small incidents that occurred, such as detection of contaminated scrap metals from the re-cycling of scrap metals from steel factories. Therefore, the radiation protection infrastructure was established after the accident. Laws and regulations of radiation safety and the relevant regulatory procedures must be revised.

To protect workers against radiation, the characteristics of the radiation field at the LHD workplace should be evaluated. The neutron fluence at the workplace was calculated by means of the radiation transportation code. Since the neutron energy distribution at the workplace has a wide energy range, from thermal to fast neutrons, a neutron dose monitor had to be especially designed. The author designed an integrating type neutron dose monitor for this purpose. Since this monitor has good responses for dose evaluation in every energy range, it should be able to evaluate the dose at the LHD workplace accurately.

Furthermore, an analysis was carried out on some examples of dose to workers during NPP operation.

J	Kurihara, O; Kanai, K				Kurihara, Osamu; Kanai, Katsuta			INDIVIDUAL MONITORING FOR INTERNAL CONTAMINATION WITH PLUTONIUM COMPOUNDS AT JAEA-NCL	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								This paper provides an outline of an individual monitoring programme for internal contamination with Pu compounds and some of the knowledge obtained from experience of inhalation incidents that occurred over the past few decades at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency, Nuclear Fuel Cycle Engineering Laboratories (JAEA-NCL). Most of the incidents resulted in minor exposure doses, being an average of 0.1 mSv at a mixed oxide plant and 1.5 mSv at a reprocessing plant. Only two incidents involving three workers resulted in exposure over the regulatory dose limits of that time. The maximum exposure dose, an effective dose equivalent of 90 mSv, was assessed for a worker involved in the incident that took place at the reprocessing plant in 1993. Only faecal measurements have been used in final dose assessments because alternative monitoring data have rarely been available. Further investigations on the physicochemical properties specific to Pu compounds in workplaces have therefore been needed to improve not only the accuracy of internal dose assessments but also the nasal swab method useful in deciding medical intervention.

The residual radioactivity should be measured and analysed to release a site for unrestricted use. The methods used for measurement of residual radioactivity have an effect on the workers' manpower and the decommissioning cost. So the development of the measurement methods of residual radioactivity with guidelines for a radiation survey and site investigation is needed to prepare for the future decommissioning of commercial Nuclear Power plants. The major considerations and characteristics of the parameters related to the decision of measurements points have been reviewed. The methods for controlling uncertainty and techniques to determine whether the measurement results achieve the survey objectives have been established.

Under current law, waste oil that has been contaminated with uranium is very difficult to dispose of at a radioactive waste disposal site. To dispose of the uranium-contaminated waste oil, the uranium was separated from the contaminated waste oil. Supercritical R-22 is an excellent solvent for extracting clean oil from uranium-contaminated waste oil. The critical temperature of R-22 is 96.15 degrees C and the critical pressure is 49.9 bar. In this study, a process to remove uranium from the uranium-contaminated waste oil using supercritical R-22 was developed. The waste oil has a small amount of additives containing N, S or P, such as amines, dithiocarbamates and dialkyldithiophosphates. It seems that these organic additives form uranium-combined compounds. For this reason, dissolution of uranium from the uranium-combined compounds using nitric acid was needed. The efficiency of the removal of uranium from the uranium-contaminated waste oil using supercritical R-22 extraction and nitric acid treatment was determined.

Seven long-lived radioactive nuclides ((46)Sc, (60)Co, (65)Zn, (134)Cs, (152)Eu, (22)Na and (54)Mn) were identified by gamma-ray spectrometry of the concrete samples. It was confirmed that the gamma-ray-emitting radionuclides induced by thermal neutrons through the (n, gamma) reaction are dominant, and that the activity induced by thermal neutrons is greater at a depth of 10-30 cm, rather than at the surface of the concrete, and decreased exponentially beyond a depth of similar to 40 cm. Although the specific activity at the surface was greater than the clearance level for radioactive waste indicated in IAEA RS-G-1.7, the mean specific activities in the walls and floor were less than the clearance level.

There is a large and diverse range of industries involved in mining or mineral processing, and the production of fossil fuels in Australia. Enhanced levels of naturally occurring radionuclides can be associated with mineral extraction and processing, other industries (e. g. metal recycling) and some products (e. g. plasterboard). ARPANSA, in conjunction with industry and State regulators, has undertaken a review and assessment of naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) management in Australian industries. This review has resulted in guidance on the management of NORM that will be included in the National Directory for Radiation Protection. The first NORM safety guide provides the framework for NORM management and addresses specific NORM issues in oil and gas production, bauxite, aluminium and phosphate industries. Over time further guidance material for other NORM-related industries will be developed. This presentation will provide an overview of the regulatory approach to managing NORM industries in Australia.

In Japanese current markets, many NRCP are sold claiming some effects like hormesis. The existence of NRCP in the living environments here may raise the radiation exposure dose of the user. The activity concentrations in many kinds of NRCP have been determined by gamma-ray spectrometry and the radiation exposure doses from NRCP were calculated in the case of normal use and misuse. The results show that there are some inhalation risks in the cases of NRCP misuse. Furthermore, many kinds of NRCP and ores were analysed by prompt gamma-ray activation analysis method and the results show the added radioactive materials in NRCP are monazite. The three principles of the radioprotection should be applied for users of NRCP. The Japanese NORM guideline of 2009 mentions requirements for optimisation (ALARA) and dose criteria, without justification. Justification is most important for an effective use of radioactive ores that are added in NRCP.

The criteria for uranium-bearing waste disposal are also necessary; however, the NSC has not concluded the discussion on this subject. Meanwhile, the General Administrative Group of the Radiation Council has concluded the revision of its former recommendation 'Regulatory exemption dose for radioactive solid waste disposal', the dose criteria after the institutional control period for a repository. The Standardization Committee on Radiation Protection in the Japan Health Physics Society (The Committee) also has developed the relevant safety criteria and guidelines for existing exposure situations, which are potentially applicable to uranium-bearing waste disposal. A new working group established by The Committee was initially aimed at developing criteria and guidelines specifically for uranium-bearing waste disposal; however, the aim has been shifted to broader criteria applicable to any radioactive wastes.

J	Yamazawa, H				Yamazawa, Hiromi			PRESENT AND FUTURE STUDIES ON ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY IN JAPAN	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							MODEL	In this paper, recent studies on environmental radioactivity are briefly reviewed. Considering the growing dependency on nuclear energy in Asia, emphasis has been given to C-14 cycle at the ground surface including rice paddy fields and to long-range atmospheric transport of natural and anthropogenic radioactive materials. Studies on the dynamic behaviour of C-14 are being carried out and some important experimental results are becoming available for models of C-14 migration in rice paddy. Long-range atmospheric transport models have been improved substantially by using sophisticated physical models and simulation techniques to improve emergency preparedness. Although our knowledge on radon flux distribution in Asia has been improved and radon has become a more reliable atmospheric tracer, we still need more intensive measurements of exhalation flux and atmospheric concentration of radon and radium content in soil.

A sector-field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer was used to study the recent sedimentation of Pu isotopes in 11 lakes in China. The distribution of (137)Cs was investigated using the conventional radiometric analytical methods. Based on the isotopic compositions of Pu and the activity ratio of (137)Cs/(239+240)Pu, the sources of artificial radionuclides were identified. The potential applications of Pu isotopes for sediment dating and for regional and global environmental change studies were discussed.

Migration experiments by column method were conducted for a sandy soil and a reddish soil by varying the volume of eluting solution. There seemed to be two chemical species of Np-237 in the sandy soil column: one is cationic and the other is particulate form. The particulates moved without significant interaction with the sandy soil. The sorption of cationic Np-237 was controlled by both a reversible ion-exchange reaction and irreversible reactions. Most of Am-241 was formed into rather large particulates and trapped in the sandy soil column. The Np-237 and Am-241 loaded into the reddish soil column moved deeper with increasing eluting volume. The sorption was mainly controlled by ion-exchange reaction. The migration behaviour might be evaluated by the distribution coefficient.

The acid leaching and total digestion were used to compare whether there is difference in Pu and Am-241 activities and Pu isotopic composition between these two methods. The results of activities of Pu239+240 and Pu-241, and Pu isotopic composition have been reported in the previous work (Sci. Total Environ. 2010, 408, 1139-1144). In this study, the Am-241 activity and Am-241/Pu239+240 activity ratio in the reference fallout material are reported, and the usefulness of Pu atom ratios and Am-241/Pu239+240 activity ratio for source identification is discussed.

BACKGROUND RADIATION AND INDIVIDUAL DOSIMETRY IN THE COSTAL AREA OF TAMIL NADU, INDIA	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							POWER-PLANT SITE; NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; AGASTHEESWARAM-TALUK; KANYAKUMARI DISTRICT; KERALA	South coast of India is known as the high-level background radiation area (HBRA) mainly due to beach sands that contain natural radionuclides as components of the mineral monazite. The rich deposit of monazite is unevenly distributed along the coastal belt of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. An HBRA site that laid in 2x7 m along the sea was found in the beach of Chinnavillai, Tamil Nadu, where the maximum ambient dose equivalent reached as high as 162.7 mSv y(-1). From the sands collected at the HBRA spot, the high-purity germanium semi-conductor detector identified six nuclides of thorium series, four nuclides of uranium series and two nuclides belonging to actinium series. The highest radioactivity observed was 43.7 Bq g(-1) of Th-228. The individual dose of five inhabitants in Chinnavillai, as measured by the radiophotoluminescence glass dosimetry system, demonstrated the average dose of 7.17 mSv y(-1) ranging from 2.79 to 14.17 mSv y(-1).

The tritium concentrations in atmospheric water vapour and precipitation had a temporal variation with relatively high values in the early summer. Spatial distribution of tritium concentrations was affected by various factors such as distance from the NPP site, wind direction, tritium discharge into the atmosphere and atmospheric dispersion factor. The annual mean concentrations of atmospheric HTO and precipitation were correlated with the amount of gaseous tritium released from the Wolsung NPP. The tritium concentrations in precipitation decrease exponentially with an increase of the distance from the Wolsung NPP site.

J	Suzuki, A; Hori, S				Suzuki, Akira; Hori, Shunsuke			CURRENT STATUS OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION AT NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS IN JAPAN	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								The radiation dose to workers at nuclear power stations (NPSs) in Japan was drastically reduced between the late-1970s and the early-1990s by continuous dose-reduction programmes. The total collective dose of radiation workers in FY 2008 was 84.04 person Sv, while the average collective dose was 1.5 person Sv per reactor. The average annual individual dose was 1.1 mSv and the maximum annual individual dose was 19.5 mSv. These values are sufficiently lower than the regulatory dose limits. Radioactive effluent released from NPSs is already so trivial that additional protective measures will not be necessary. Experience in radiation protection at NPSs has been accumulated over 40 y and will be very useful in establishing a rational radiation control system in the future.

SPECTROSCOPY OF PLASMA SURFACE INTERACTION IN EXPERIMENTS SIMULATING ITER TRANSIENT EVENTS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Youth Conference IYC on Fusion Energy	OCT 09-10, 2010	Daejeon, SOUTH KOREA				I ELMS; DISRUPTIONS; DEVICES; LOADS	This report presents the results of experimental studies of powerful plasma impacts upon tungsten and carbon surfaces, which are ITER relevant Plasma Facing Materials (PFMs). The simulation experiments were carried out with a QSPA Kh-50 (Quasi-Stationary Plasma Accelerator) in Kharkov Institute of Physics and Technology (Ukraine) and an RPI-IBIS (Multi-Rod Plasma Injector) facility in the Andrzej Soltan Institute for Nuclear Studies (IPJ) Swierk (Poland). QSPA Kh-50 generates hydrogen plasma streams of duration of 0.25 ms and the heat loads in the range of 0.2- 2.5 MJ/m(2), which correspond to the Edge Localized Modes (ELM) impacts expected in ITER. The plasma stream diameter is 18 cm, averaged ion energy is about 0.4 keV, and the maximum plasma pressure achieves 3.2 bar. Due to that fact, using the QSPA Kh-50 it is possible to simulate ITER transient events. Deuterium plasma streams with power density of 10-50 W/m(2) and pulse duration of 1-5 mu s, generated by RPI-IBIS were used for comparative studies and determination of an initial stage of evaporated impurities dynamics during plasma-surface interactions as well as features of surface damages appearing under varied plasma parameters. In order to determinate the main plasma parameters (an electron density and temperature) and to study of impurities behavior at the time of discharge the use was made of optical spectroscopy methods. The onset of a vapor shield in front of the target surface was investigated in dependence on a surface heat load for tungsten (W) and carbon (C) targets. Information about dynamics of the W- and C-ions production was obtained. Some issues of the droplet splashing at the tungsten surfaces and the formation of hot spots upon the graphite surface, which can be sources of the enhanced evaporation, are also discussed	[Ladygina, M.

Thus, it is beneficial for developing radiation protection to calculate the types and the activities of radionuclides. Here we applied both a theoretical analysis and a Monte-Carlo method to compute the induced radioactivity in a copper probe irradiated by proton beam. Various kinds of radionuclides saturation activity obtained by these two different methods were compared. The comparisons of the results cast by the two methods show the similar saturation activities for (63)Zn and (65)Zn. However, the Monte-Carlo method conducted by the software FLUKA is able to provide a more complete consideration on nuclear reaction, and to calculate both the direct and indirect radioactivity under different irradiation time. Furthermore, by employing the FLUKA Monte-Carlo program, the induced radioactivity of three types of probe materials (Cu, Ta and W) under low-energy (below 20 MeV) proton beam irradiated were also separately simulated and tantalum is considered as the best material for low-energy proton interceptive diagnostics probe due to the higher energy threshold of nuclear reaction and the lower radioactivity.

IMPROVED EYE PLAQUE BRACHYTHERAPY DOSIMETRY USING MONTE CARLO METHODS	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th Biennial Topical Meeting of the American-Nuclear-Society-(ANS)-and-Radiation-Protection-and-Shielding-Division-(RPSD)	APR, 2010	Univ Nevada, Las Vegas, NV	Amer Nucl Soc, Radiation Protection Shielding Div	Univ Nevada	Monte Carlo; eye plaque; brachytherapy	I-125 SEED; PD-103; RECOMMENDATIONS; THERAPY	Eye plaque brachytherapy is a sight-preserving medical procedure in which radioactive sources are reproducibly arranged within a collimating source backing and temporarily sutured to the eye. The procedure was established as an alternative to enucleation or eye removal for the treatment ocular melanoma. The 1987 Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS) standardized this treatment technique in a prospective, randomized clinical trial; however, dose calculations were performed using simple assumptions. These assumptions used the point-source dosimetry formalism, omitted dose anisotropy, and ignored the presence of dose perturbing material heterogeneities. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations from the mid-1980s to the present have critically evaluated these assumptions and indicated where improvements in practice could be made. Various investigators have used MC to evaluate plaque design, choice of source radionuclide, X-ray fluorescence from plaque components, plaque material heterogeneity attenuation, and patient tissue heterogeneity attenuation, among others. These publications are reviewed with emphasis on clinically relevant observations. In addition, MC simulations of standard COMS eye plaques using MCNP5 are made and compared to published data using other MC codes. Good agreement is observed between radiation transport codes with differences <2%, for points within the eye globe. These results indicate that historically delivered radiation doses were systematically lower than prescribed doses. Practical considerations for implementing MC calculations in the clinic are introduced, and the need for a heterogeneity-corrected treatment planning system to ensure treatment uniformity across medical centers and for different treatment techniques is discussed.

REPRESENTATION OF A LOW-YIELD NUCLEAR WEAPON NEUTRON SPECTRUM USING AN (alpha, n) NEUTRON SOURCE	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th Biennial Topical Meeting of the American-Nuclear-Society-(ANS)-and-Radiation-Protection-and-Shielding-Division-(RPSD)	APR, 2010	Univ Nevada, Las Vegas, NV	Amer Nucl Soc, Radiation Protection Shielding Div	Univ Nevada	Monte Carlo calculation; radioisotope neutron source; low-yield fission weapon simulation	GAMMA	Recent nuclear weapons testing in the limit of low-yield detonations has underscored the need to ensure that radiation detection and monitoring equipment can adequately respond to these events. Testing and validating equipment in appropriate reference fields have become difficult since the closing of the NATO primary fission spectra reference at the Aberdeen Proving Ground Fast Burst Reactor facility post-9/11. A simple and low-cost device was designed to perform testing of commercial off-the-shelf neutron detection equipment to the expected spectral shape from a low-yield nuclear weapon. By enclosing an (241)AmBe (alpha,n) neutron source within a heavy water-moderated sphere, the general shape of a I-kiloton standard fission weapon was generated at I m, valid between 100 and 2000 keV. The 1-m dose rate expected from this configuration is similar to 2.16 x 10(-10) mu Sv.h(-1).Bq(-1), which is less than one-half of the unshielded dose rate.

Although the field of gamma dosimetry is well developed and reliable, challenges exist with personal neutron dosimetry. A number of gamma and neutron dosimeters were evaluated for their efficacy in providing personal dosimetry for radioisotope source manipulations. A commercial off-the-shelf electronic neutron dosimeter was observed to underestimate total operator dose when manipulating a (252)Cf source. In this work, scaling factors were evaluated using both experimental results and Monte Carlo simulations to allow a measured electronic personal gamma dosimeter (EPGD) dose to be used to estimate the total neutron + gamma dose. The recommended scaling factor using an MGP SOR/R EPGD for free-field (252)Cf is 18, and for shielded (252)Cf the recommended scaling factor is 6. A conservative single scaling factor of 18 is appropriate for personal dosimetry estimates.

EVOLUTION OF SHIELDING COMPUTATIONS FOR THE ITER UPPER ECH LAUNCHER	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th Biennial Topical Meeting of the American-Nuclear-Society-(ANS)-and-Radiation-Protection-and-Shielding-Division-(RPSD)	APR, 2010	Univ Nevada, Las Vegas, NV	Amer Nucl Soc, Radiation Protection Shielding Div	Univ Nevada	fusion neutronics; MCNP radiation transport; ITER upper ECH launcher	ECRH LAUNCHER; WASTE MANAGEMENT; UPPER PORT; NEUTRONICS; SYSTEM	This paper presents an overview of the evolution of the radiation shielding calculations for the ITER upper port electron cyclotron heating (ECH) launcher performed over the last 6 yr at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). The current advances at KIT in the development of the McCad program as an interface between a computer-aided-design (CAD) system and the Monte Carlo radiation transport codes Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) Version 5 (MCNP5) and TRIPOLI-4 enable a substantial increase of neutronic calculation efficiency for the development of nuclear systems design. This work provides new results in the application of calculation techniques enhanced with the CAD-based radiation transport capabilities of McCad and with the inherent features of MCNP5 such as its variance-reduction techniques (VRTs) and mesh tallies. High-resolution mapping of the helium production distribution in the ITER location that was supposed to be rewelded was accomplished using the MCNP mesh tally. This mapping is important because the reweldability of irradiated steel is limited by the content of helium generated. In the ITER heterogeneous models with the possibility of radiation streaming effects resulting in hot spots, the need to obtain excellent results closely related to the original CAD model is an additional reason to use McCAD. The statistical errors associated with the mesh tally results were reduced by applying VRTs and by taking advantage of the MCNP5 message passing interface parallel computations on the JUROPA High Performance Computer for Fusion operated in the Juelich Supercomputer Centre at Forschungszentrum Juelich. The shielding calculations were supplemented with activation analyses of the ECU launcher irradiated materials performed by the FISPACT-2005 inventory code. The French system of radioactive waste (RW) management adopted by ITER was applied to the classification of the launcher's steel irradiated during the 20-yr Modified Design Requirements and Guidelines Level 1 (M-DRG1) ITER operational scenario.

BENCHMARKING A CAD-BASED MONTE CARLO CODE USING FUSION-SPECIFIC EXPERIMENTS	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th Biennial Topical Meeting of the American-Nuclear-Society-(ANS)-and-Radiation-Protection-and-Shielding-Division-(RPSD)	APR, 2010	Univ Nevada, Las Vegas, NV	Amer Nucl Soc, Radiation Protection Shielding Div	Univ Nevada	Monte Carlo; MCNP; fusion	FRASCATI NEUTRON GENERATOR; BLANKET MOCK-UP; GEOMETRY; MESH	Researchers at the University of Wisconsin Madison Fusion Technology Institute and Argonne National Laboratories have recently developed a computer-aided-design based Monte Carlo code (DAG-MCNP5) to perform nuclear analysis of complex three-dimensional systems such as ITER. In this work, DAG-MCNP5 calculated results will be compared to native MCNP5-calculated results and to measured results for ITER-specific benchmark experiments in order to provide additional quality assurance for DAG-MCNP. Calculated results are compared for the bulk shield mock-up and the helium-cooled pebble bed (HCPB) breeder blanket mock-up, which utilize the 14-MeV Frascati Neutron Generator facility. Neutron flux was measured at different depths in these experimental mock-ups using activation foils that cover the neutron energy range of 0 to 14 MeV. Additionally, tritium production in Li(2)CO(3) pellets was measured in the HCPB experiment. Results of the foil activation calculations for the bulk shielding experiment and the HCPB breeder experiment show agreement within statistical uncertainty for DAG-MCNP5 and native MCNP5. Calculated results for tritium production in the HCPB mock-up also agree within statistical uncertainty for the DAG-MCNP5 and native MCNP5 calculations. Timing results showed that DAG-MCNP5 is 5.3 times slower than native MCNP5 for the bulk shield mock-up. For the HCPB mock-up, DAG-MCNP5 is 4.8 times slower than native MCNP5. It is concluded that the close agreement of calculated foil activation and tritium production between DAG-MCNP5 and native MCNP5 in these complex and ITER-relevant geometries provides additional quality assurance for the DAG-MCNP5 code and the mcnp2cad tool used in this work.

TREATMENT OF SHIELDING IN REAL-TIME SOURCE TRACKING SOFTWARE	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th Biennial Topical Meeting of the American-Nuclear-Society-(ANS)-and-Radiation-Protection-and-Shielding-Division-(RPSD)	APR, 2010	Univ Nevada, Las Vegas, NV	Amer Nucl Soc, Radiation Protection Shielding Div	Univ Nevada	source localization; shielding; RADTRAC		Within the homeland security and emergency response communities, there is a need for a low-profile system to detect, locate, and identify radioactive sources in real time. Such a system could be deployed for area monitoring around venues for special events. A system was developed at Argonne National Laboratory, called RADTRAC, which is based on a network of radiation detectors and advanced signal-processing algorithms. The initial implementation of RADTRAC did not account for dynamically changing shielding due to crowd movements. An algorithm was developed that utilizes the gamma-ray energy spectrum from each detector to estimate the amount of attenuation and scattering that is present between the source location (a priori unknown) and the detector location in real time. The attenuation and scattering estimations are then included in the maximum likelihood model to significantly improve the source localization solution. Results are presented for several test cases showing the improvement in the real-time source localization solution. This algorithm has been implemented into the current version of RADTRAC such that it now accounts for the effects of dynamically changing shielding and scattering due to crowd movements in real time in order to accurately determine the source location in crowded venues.

Based on advanced variance-reduction techniques and powerful geometry modeling capabilities, MAVRIC can tackle this large ISFSI shielding problem by directly simulating the radiation transport in a full-scale model. This study started with a benchmark calculation of a single storage cask and then investigated the impact of a fully loaded ISFSI on the dose rates at the site boundary. Because of the short distance to the nearest site boundary, additional shielding to the cask itself or the site is necessary to meet the stringent design dose limit. Compared to the two-step cask-by-cask approach adopted in the original safety analysis report, this method of analyzing the site boundary doses is straightforward and efficient enough to allow us to evaluate the effect of the cask design modification and to test various options for further improvement.

This study aimed to evaluate the performance of MAVRIC with the latest cross-section library in calculating the surface dose rates of a realistic spent-fuel storage cask. Detailed dose rate profiles over the cask side and top surfaces were calculated, and the results were compared with our previous work using SAS4 and MCNP. In order to duplicate the same source model, the MAVRIC code has been modified to accommodate a user-defined axial source distribution. The comparison among the three codes was evaluated in terms of their accuracies and computational efficiencies. For the gamma-ray sources, the MAVRIC-calculated results are more accurate than SAS4 and consistent with those predicted by the continuous-energy MCNP calculations. Meanwhile, its computational efficiencies are comparable to the performance of the TORT-coupled MCNP calculations. For the fuel neutron source, the MAVRIC calculation with broad-group cross sections cannot give satisfactory result, and its computational performance is also a factor of 10 less efficient than that of TORT-coupled MCNP. With a fine-group cross-section library, MAVRIC can provide a better prediction but still underestimates the surface dose rates of the cask by 15 to 30%.	[Chen, Y. F.; Jiang, S.

Samples were collected as follows: downwind of the Nevada Test Site (NTS); in the fallout pattern of the shuttered Mohave Power Plant, located in Laughlin, Nevada; and, near the operating Reid-Gardner Power Plant, just east of Las Vegas, Nevada. Analysis of the NTS rock varnish shows (240)Pu/(239)Pu mass ratios as low as 0.0592 +/- 0.0003 and (241)Pu/(239)Pu ratios as low as 0.00063 +/- 0.00004, compared to worldwide values of 0.18 +/- 0.01 and 0.009 +/- 0.002, respectively, clearly indicating that the varnish can be used as a forensic tool for identifying the source of air pollution, in this case the NTS. The samples collected in the plumes of the coal-fired power plants contain thorium and uranium, and have (232)Th/(238)U mass ratios from 1 to 30, and concentrations from 5 to 755 ppm for Th and 1 to 578 ppm for U. The highest concentrations of these elements occur together at locations that implicate the power plants; however, additional samples would be required to demonstrate unequivocally that the power plants are the sources. Overall, it is apparent that rock varnish can be utilized as a passive monitor to investigate recent air pollution.
