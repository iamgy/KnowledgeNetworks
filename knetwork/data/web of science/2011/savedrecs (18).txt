Trapping of permeating deuterium in defect induced at the rear side of tungsten samples	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	19th International Conference on Plasma-Surface Interactions in Controlled Fusion Devices (PSI)	MAY 24-28, 2010	Univ Calif, Gen Atom, San Diego, CA	Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab	Univ Calif, Gen Atom		LARGE DEPTHS; ION	As plasma-facing material in the Iter divertor area, tungsten will be subjected to bombardment with low-energy, high-flux deuterium and tritium particles, as well as 14 MeV neutrons. At elevated temperatures, hydrogen isotopes can diffuse into W material and can be trapped in n-induced defects. To account for this effect, the trapping of diffusing deuterium at defects generated in the rear side of the 25 and 500 mu m thick W samples damaged up to a depth of 2.2 mu m to a damage level of similar to 0.3 dpa was studied. The front side of each sample was exposed to a deuterium plasma at elevated temperatures. The results show that D atoms permeate through the whole width of the sample and are trapped in ion-induced defects. The highest D retention was measured at 460 K - beyond that point, due to the de-trapping process, it decreases with increasing irradiation temperature. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effect of ELMs on deuterium-loaded-tungsten plasma facing components	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	19th International Conference on Plasma-Surface Interactions in Controlled Fusion Devices (PSI)	MAY 24-28, 2010	Univ Calif, Gen Atom, San Diego, CA	Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab	Univ Calif, Gen Atom		RETENTION; DIMES	Prior heat pulse testing of plasma facing components (PFCs) has been completed in vacuum environments without the presence of background plasma. Edge localized modes (ELMs) will not be this kind of isolated event and one should know the effect of a plasma background during these transients. Heat-pulse experiments have been conducted in the PISCES-A device utilizing laser heating in a divertor-like plasma background. Initial results indicate that the erosion of PFCs is enhanced as compared to heat pulse or plasma only tests. To determine if the enhanced erosion effect is a phenomena only witnessed in the laboratory PISCES device, tungsten and graphite samples were exposed to plasmas in the lower divertor of the DIII-D tokamak using the Divertor Material Evaluation System (DiMES). Mass loss analysis indicates that materials that contain significant deuterium prior to experiencing a transient heating event will erode faster than those that have no or little retained deuterium.

The influence of displacement damage on deuterium retention in tungsten exposed to divertor plasma in DIII-D	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	19th International Conference on Plasma-Surface Interactions in Controlled Fusion Devices (PSI)	MAY 24-28, 2010	Univ Calif, Gen Atom, San Diego, CA	Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab	Univ Calif, Gen Atom		EROSION	Experiments were conducted to determine the influence of displacement damage on retention of deuterium in tungsten plasma-facing components in a tokamak. Tungsten samples, previously damaged by ion irradiation, were exposed to the outer strike point of attached H-mode plasmas in DIII-D. Nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) was used to measure the depth profile of deuterium retained in the tungsten. Displacement damage increased the concentration of retained deuterium to the maximum depth (about 2.5 mu m) of the damage, to concentrations up to 0.003 D/W, compared to D/W < 10(-5) in undamaged W. Tungsten coverage on adjacent carbon surfaces of the probe was mapped by Rutherford backscattering, giving the average tungsten erosion rate and spatial variation of redeposition.

TMAP7 simulations of deuterium trapping in pre-irradiated tungsten exposed to high-flux plasma	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	19th International Conference on Plasma-Surface Interactions in Controlled Fusion Devices (PSI)	MAY 24-28, 2010	Univ Calif, Gen Atom, San Diego, CA	Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab	Univ Calif, Gen Atom		DAMAGED TUNGSTEN; HYDROGEN; MOLYBDENUM; RETENTION; RELEASE	Tungsten targets are irradiated with 12.3 MeV W4+ ions to damage levels up to 2.0 displacements per atom. These irradiated targets are then exposed to high-flux deuterium plasmas with surface temperatures ranging from 360 to 950 K. Nuclear reaction analysis shows significant enhancement of retention in the damaged region of the tungsten for all temperatures. Thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) shows an enhancement of both high energy and low-energy trap concentrations due to the W4+ irradiation although the distribution of the trapped deuterium among these different trap types can vary strongly with temperature. In this investigation, TMAP7, a 1-D slab model hydrogen transport code, is used to fit the TDS spectra to gain insight into the trap energies and evolution and trapping mechanisms during the plasma exposure. At lower temperatures the trapping is diffusion-limited, while at the highest temperatures, there is a significant fraction of unfilled low-energy traps and trap annealing. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Fey, B				Fey, Bruno			Comparison of environmental impact of waste disposal from fusion, fission and coal-fired power plants	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article								The radiotoxic hazard of waste from fusion power plants has been compared with that of fission power and radioactive trace elements in coal ash within some research programs such as SEAFP and SEIF. Within another program, in 2005 a Power Plant Conceptual Study (PPCS) has been finalized investigating 4 fusion power plant models A to D. In this paper, the radiotoxicity of model B is compared with a fission power plant, concentrating on the production of wastes. The hazard of the respective masses of enriched uranium before use in a fission power plant and coal ash of a power plant generating the same amount of electricity are used as benchmarks. It is evident that the development of ingestion and inhalation hazard of the PPCS model B is different from the results of earlier studies because of different assumptions on material impurities and other constraints. An important aspect is the presence of actinides in fusion power plant waste.

J	Weis, M; van Bevern, K; Linnemann, T				Weis, Michael; van Bevern, Katrin; Linnemann, Thomas			Funding Nuclear Power Research 1956 to 2010: Startup Finance or Subsidy?	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								In the public debate about the use and the benefits of nuclear power plants the allegation is being made again and again that nuclear power to this day had received public subsidies. That was the only reason why electricity from nuclear power plants was economically viable. That statement is wrong. Various federal governments, including the former federal government under Chancellor Schroder and Vice Chancellor Fischer, which surely cannot be suspected of ever having supported nuclear power, said so in clear words. In actual fact, the use of nuclear power in Germany to this day, corrected for inflation and assuming an average production cost edge of euro cent 2/kWh, has saved the German economy approx. EUR 90 billion. If the 17 remaining nuclear generating units were allowed to spend also the second half of their minimum technical lifespan of 60 years, a production cost edge of 6 euro cent/kWh (no more depreciation, and rising market prices as a result of including carbon costs) again would save a calculated EURO 270 billion (in current money). The development of nuclear power and its fuel cycle of course has been supported with public funds like any other energy resource in current use. In this connection, extreme lump sum amounts are mentioned that merit more exact analysis and investigation. This was done for the first time in detail in 2004 and updated in 2008. The article constitutes another update for 2011 and contains information about the current debate. EUR 7.83 billion to date have been spent on R&D in connection with LWR technology and its fuel cycle. Another EUR 9.37 billion were spent on other reactors not used commercially in Germany, such as fast breeders, high-temperature reactors, and nuclear fusion. However, these must be separated from LWR technology and thus have not made, and are not making, any contribution to today's electricity supply from nuclear power. Again, it becomes evident that the R&D funds provided by the government were meant to be startup financing. Indeed, this approach has served its purpose convincingly in those instances where the individual technologies were able to develop. So there can be no doubt about the economic benefit of the development of nuclear power. This finding is not changed in any way by nuclear development lines, such as the fast breeder or high-temperature reactor, which ultimately fell victim to political decisions, nor by the opt-out of the use of nuclear power within 11 years as decided by the federal parliament in 2011 which now, soon after the opt-out of the opt-out in the autumn of 2011, is being executed irrespective of the interests of neighboring European countries.

A novel path in partitioning: Water-soluble BTP ligands for the innovative SANEX process	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article							EXTRACTION	Separation of long-lived radionuclides from spent nuclear fuel, with subsequent conversion into shorter lived or stable nuclides by fast neutron induced fission reaction, is a promising concept to reduce the long term radiotoxicity of high level nuclear waste. This concept is designated as partitioning and transmutation strategy. Since the separation of the different actinides cannot be realized in one step, a multistage process with several liquid-liquid extraction steps is necessary. In order to facilitate an efficient process, highly effective extracting agents are required. Aq-BTP, a new masking agent for separating trivalent minor actinides (Ann(III),Cm (III)) from lanthanides is presented. It displays very high separation factors of SFEu(III)/Am(III) approximate to 1000. Using time-resolved laser fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS) 3 Cm(III) complex species [Cm(H(2)O)9 3n(aq-BTP)n] (n = 1,2,3) were identified in H(2)O and 0.5 M HNO(3). Stability constants of logK(01) = 5.9, logK(02) = 9.6 and logK(03) = 13.1 in H(2)O and logK(01) = 3.1, logK(02) = 6.7, logK(03) = 11.0 in 0.5 M HNO(3) were determined.

The inorganic-based hydrophobic Pt catalyst named HIP has been developed especially for efficient oxidation over a wide concentration range of hydrogen isotopes at room temperature, even in the presence of saturated water vapor. The overall reaction rate constant for hydrogen oxidation with the HIP catalyst in a flow-through system using a tritium tracer was determined as a function of space velocity, hydrogen concentration in carriers, temperature of the catalyst, and water vapor concentration in carriers. The overall reaction rate constant for the HIP catalyst in the range near room temperature was considerably larger than that for the traditionally applied Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. Moreover, the decrease in reaction rate for HIP in the presence of saturated water vapor was slight compared with the reaction rate in the absence of water vapor due to the excellent hydrophobic performance of HIP. Oxidation reaction on the catalyst surface is the rate-controlling step in the range near room temperature and the rate-controlling step is shifted to diffusion in a catalyst substratum above 313 K due to its fine porosity. The overall reaction rate constant in the range near room temperature was dependent on the space velocity and hydrogen concentration in carriers. The overall reaction rate constants in the range of 1,000/T greater than 3.2 correlated to k(overall) [S-1] = 5.59 x 10(7) x SV[h(-1)] x exp (- 67.7[kJ/mol]/RgT), where the space velocity range was from 600 to 7,200 h(-1).

The yeast was grown in a solution containing Co(IT) ions, a carbon source, and essential elements (metabolically active condition). For comparison, an adsorption experiment of Co(II) ions on the yeast cells under resting condition without essential elements was performed. Time courses of Co concentration in the solution, in the cells, and chemical states of the accumulated Co were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE), and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analyses. The time courses of Co concentration in the solution showed that a higher amount of Co was accumulated by the yeast cells under the metabolically active condition than under the resting one. PIXE analyses showed the concurrent accumulation of Fe with Co accumulation under the metabolically active condition, suggesting the intracellular accumulation of Co. XAFS analyses showed that the k(3)-weighted extended-XAFS functions and the radial structural function of Co accumulated by the yeast cells under the metabolically active condition are similar to those under the resting condition, indicating that the chemical states of the accumulated Co were nearly the same between both conditions. These results indicate that the yeast performs better retardation of the migration of Co under the metabolically active condition than under the resting one.

The conventional aqueous process, such as PUREX, is not appropriate for treating metal fuel. Pyroprocessing technology has advantages over the aqueous process: less proliferation risk, treatment of spent fuel with relatively high heat and radioactivity, compact equipment, etc. The addition of an oxide reduction process to the pyroprocessing metal fuel treatment enables handling of oxide spent fuel, which draws a potential option for the management of spent fuel from the PWR. In this context, KAERI has been developing pyroprocessing technology to handle the oxide spent fuel since the 1990s. This paper describes the current status of pyroprocessing technology development at KAERI from the head-end process to the waste treatment. A unit process with various scales has been tested to produce the design data associated with the scale up. A performance test of unit processes integration will be conducted at the PRIDE facility, which will be constructed by early 2012. The PRIDE facility incorporates the unit processes all together in a cell with an Ar environment. The purpose of PRIDE is to test the processes for unit process performance, operability by remote equipment, the integrity of the unit processes, process monitoring, Ar environment system operation, and safeguards related activities. The test of PRIDE will be promising for further pyroprocessing technology development.

A Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) was developed to extend uranium resource utilization under a growing nuclear energy scenario while concomitantly providing a nuclear waste management solution. Key questions in this scenario are when to introduce SFRs and how many reactors should be introduced. In this study, a methodology using Linear Programming is employed in order to quantify an optimized growth pattern of a nuclear energy system comprising light water reactors and SFRs. The optimization involves tradeoffs between SFR capital cost premiums and the total system U3O8 price premiums. Optimum nuclear growth patterns for several scenarios are presented, as well as sensitivity analyses of important input parameters.

When the water of the storing vessels vaporizes or drains due to unexpected leaking, the U metal chips are able to open to air. A new oxidation treatment process was raised for a long time safe storage with concepts of drying under vacuum, evaporating the containing water and organic material with elevating temperature, and oxidizing the uranium metal chips at an appropriate high temperature under conditions of controlling the feeding rate of oxygen gas. In order to optimize the oxidation process the uranium metal chips were completely dried at higher temperature than 300 degrees C and tested for oxidation at various temperatures, which are 300 degrees C; 400 degrees C, and 500 degrees C. When the oxidation temperature was 400 degrees C, the oxidized sample for 7 hours showed a temperature rise of 60 C in the self-ignition test. But the oxidized sample for 14 hours revealed a slight temperature rise of 7 C representing a stable behavior in the self-ignition test. When the temperature was 500 degrees C, the shorter oxidation for 7 hours appeared to be enough because the self-ignition test represented no temperature rise. By using several chemical analyses such as carbon content determination, X-ray deflection (XRD), infrared spectra (IR) and Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) on the oxidation treated samples, the results of self-ignition test of new oxidation treatment process for U metal chip were interpreted and supported.

CANDU reactors with reactor grade plutonium/thorium carbide fuel	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article							THORIUM	Reactor grade (RG) plutonium, accumulated as nuclear waste of commercial reactors can be re-utilized in CANDU reactors. TRISO type fuel can withstand very high fuel burn ups. On the other hand, carbide fuel would have higher neutronic and thermal performance than oxide fuel. In the present work, RG-PuC/ThC TRISO fuels particles are imbedded body-centered cubic (BCC) in a graphite matrix with a volume fraction of 60%. The fuel compacts conform to the dimensions of sintered CANDU fuel compacts are inserted in 37 zircolay rods to build the fuel zone of a bundle. Investigations have been conducted on a conventional CANDU reactor based on GENTILLYII design with 380 fuel bundles in the core. Three mixed fuel composition have been selected for numerical calculation; (1) 10% RG-PuC + 90% ThC; (2) 30% RG-PuC + 70% ThC; (3) 50% RG-PuC + 50% ThC. Initial reactor criticality values for the modes (I), (2) and (3) are calculated as k(infinity,0) = 1.4848, 1.5756 and 1.627, respectively. Corresponding operation lifetimes are similar to 2.7, 8.4, and 15 years and with burn ups of similar to 72000, 222 000 and 366 000 MW.d/tonne, respectively Higher initial plutonium charge leads to higher burn ups and longer operation periods. In the course of reactor operation, most of the plutonium will be incinerated. At the end of life, remnants of plutonium isotopes would survive; and few amounts of uranium, americium and curium isotopes would be produced.

Atmospheric dispersion of accidental release of radioactive gases from high enriched and low enriched fuel of Miniature Neutron Source Reactors (MNSR)	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article								Analysis has been done for accidental release of radioactive gases from high and low enriched fuel of miniature neutron source reactors (MNSR). Calculations have been performed for existing high enriched uranium (HEU) fuelled core and prospected low enriched uranium (LEU) fuelled core. Composition of existing HEU fuel is UAl(4)-Al while prospected LEU fuel is UO(2). The ORIGEN2 code has been used for burn up and source term calculations. The "Hotspot" version 2.06 has been employed for radiological dispersion analysis to model the release of radioactivity in case of accident. Site specific meteorological data has been employed to determine the dose values for different stability classes as a function of downwind distance. In case of a radiological accident releasing radioactive gases at ground level, the maximum Total Effective Dose Equivalent (TEDE) is about 0.26 Sv for the most prevailing meteorological conditions at the site. There were no appreciable differences found in doses for HEU and LEU fuel.

Peripheral blood was sampled at I-131 pre-treatment of 1 day, and I-131 post-treatment of 7, 91, and 182 days, thus analyzing lymphocyte micronucleus scores and karyotyping profiles. Compared with the control group, the lymphocyte micronucleus and chromosome mutation rates in I-131 treated DTC increased after post-treatment of 7 days, recovered after post-treatment of 91 days, and did not bounce after post-treatment of 182 days. The micronucleus and chromosome mutation rates in the combination of DTC 3.70 GBq I-131 with CMNa showed less significant variation than other treated DTC groups. Our results demonstrate that micronucleus assay and karyotyping analysis are favorable to evaluate I-131 radiotherapy for DTC.

Mechanisms of soil water movement were deciphered by comparing the soil water isotope profiles with the isotopic composition of precipitation. The results show that evaporation at the upper depth led to enrichment of the heavy isotopes. Compared to the loess profile, the shallow soil water of sand profile is relatively enriched in D and (18)O due to macro-pore and low water-holding capacity. The precipitation is infiltrated into soil in piston mode, accompanied with significant mixing of older soil water. The preferential fluid flow in loess was observed at depths of 0-20 cm, caused by cracks in the depths. The hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions in outflow are close to the precipitation, which shows a mixing of the precipitation and old soil water, and indicates that the isotopic composition of outflow water is mainly controlled by that of the precipitation. The delta D and delta(18)O in outflow decreased with time until stable delta values of outflow are close to those of the precipitation.

Scoping assessment of design characteristics for an enhanced calandria tube	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								Over the lifetime of a CANada Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) type reactor, the pressure tubes and calandria tubes undergo creep deformation via static, dynamic and thermal stresses accelerated by neutron bombardment. Creep deformation leads to fuelling issues, potential contact between the calandria tube (CT) and the liquid injection shutdown system or between the CT and the pressure tube (PT). As such, this aging phenomenon limits the lifetime of these components. Also, in the event of Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) and Loss of Emergency Coolant Injection (LOECI) scenarios, PT/CT contact may occur and if sufficient cooling is not provided, PT/CT rupture may also occur. Conceptual designs were assessed to determine their potential for reducing the effects of aging by improving CT rigidity and thermal performance of the CT. Two different design options for a CT have been investigated using numerical simulation techniques. The CT design options include fins and ribs of different sizes and combinations. The fins and ribs provide improved structural integrity and improved thermal performance over the reactors lifetime. Analyzed results have shown that the design options yield an increased overall strength with a minimal impact on fuel efficiency. The analysis has determined that the finned design option is superior in terms of CT strength enhancement yet the ribbed design is superior for improving heat transfer in accident scenarios.

The glass, a candidate for joining and sealing advanced fuel cladding materials, such as silicon carbide (SiC), undergoes a recrystallization process above 1000 degrees C providing a mixture that exhibits two melting points at 1379 and 1410 degrees C. Samples containing glass and actinide oxide mixtures did not form new phases, nor did the actinide oxides influence the recrystallization behavior of the glass. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Guo, WL; Liang, TX				Guo, Wenli; Liang, Tongxiang			Modeling of air region height in the casting process for preparing UO2 kernels	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								In the process of preparing UO2 kernels, the casting solution is emitted from the nozzle into an air region to obtain droplets with good sphericity. Before the droplets enter the aqueous ammonia solution, they pass through an ammonia gas atmosphere for prehardening. The distance from the nozzle to the ammonia gas section is the height of the air region. In this paper a mathematical model was established to calculate the optimized height of air region, which is about 11.4 cm. Effects of nozzle number, solution density and inner diameter of nozzle on the height are discussed. The effective method for reducing height of air region is to increase the inner diameter of nozzle. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A non destructive technique for determination of U-233 and Pu content in MOX fuel pins for fast reactors	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							PLUTONIUM	MOX fuel pins containing both (UO2)-O-233 and PuO2 have been fabricated for making an experimental subassembly for irradiation in Fast Breeder Test reactor (FBTR) at Kalpakkam, India. This unique composition of the fuel pin is chosen to simulate the thermo-mechanical conditions of the upcoming Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) in the existing Fast Breeder Test Reactor. Since the fertile matrix is natural UO2, it was difficult to monitor the percentage of (UO2)-O-233 through chemical methods and neutron assay methods. During the fabrication of MOX fuel pins at Advanced Fuel Fabrication Facility; Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Tarapur, Passive Gamma Scanning (PGS) was employed as one of the characterisation tools for verifying the fuel composition. PGS was found to be effective in estimating the percentage composition of both (UO2)-O-233 and PuO2 and also in ensuring the uniform distribution of the fissile material in MOX fuel pins. PGS is also found effective in monitoring the correct loading of natural UO2 insulation pellets and MOX fuel pellets in welded MOX pins. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Devi, K. V.

The code is designed by coupling of two stand-alone mechanistic codes MFPR (for modeling of irradiated UO(2) fuel behavior and fission product release) and SVECHA/QUENCH, or S/Q (for modeling of Zr cladding thermo-mechanical and physico-chemical behavior). Both codes were initially designed for accident conditions (and for this reason, are rather mechanistic) and later extended to various normal operation conditions. On the base of thorough validation against various out-of-pile and in-pile experiments, development of an advanced fuel performance code for best estimate code calculations for both normal and off-normal LWR operation regimes is foreseen.

Investigative studies on effect of reflector thickness on the performance of low enriched uranium-fueled miniature neutron source reactors	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								Neutronics analyses were performed on the 30 kW(th) GHARR-1 facility to investigate the effects on increased beryllium annular reflector thickness on nuclear criticality safety and on the neutron flux levels in the experimental channels. The investigative study was carried out using the Monte Carlo code MCNP on a hypothetical LEU UO(2) core theoretically enriched to 12.6% and having the same core configuration as the present 90.2% enriched HEU U-Al core. The analyses were performed on four models consisting of a reference model with 10.2 cm annular reflector thickness and three new design modification models with increased reflector thickness of 10.3, 10.4 and 10.5 cm respectively. The simulations indicated average thermal neutron fluxes of (9.80 +/- 0.0017)E+11 n/cm(2) s in the inner irradiation channels for the reference model, indicating a 2% decrease with respect to the nominal flux of 1.00E+12 n/cm(2) s. Relatively lower neutron fluxes were obtained for the modification models with an average of (9.79 +/- 0.0017)E+11 n/cm(2) s, representing losses of 2.01% and 0.01% with respect to the HEU core and reference LEU model.

X.; Xin, Jin			Diameter deviation calculation for UO2 kernel by sol-gel process	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								UO2 kernels for HTR (High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor) fuel element are produced using a sol-gel method. The size of UO2 kernels was controlled strictly by minimizing the dispersion of the UO2 kernel diameter during the casting process. A relationship between the filling gas tank pressure and solution level in the tank was developed to keep a constant solution mass flow rate in the nozzles. Based on equation of flow energy conservation, a formula about jet velocity, solution level and gas tank pressure on solution was established. Using the formula, the minimum pressure and maximum pressure were calculated. During the casting process, the decline of solution level will lead to the decreasing of jet velocity and the solution mass flow rate that can cause the increasing of diameter deviation. By compensating the pressure on the liquid gradually during the casting process, the flow fluency was kept in an acceptable range stably, the standard deviation of kernel diameter was less than 12 mu m.

J	Webb, JA; Charit, I				Webb, Jonathan A.; Charit, Indrajit			Monte Carlo criticality analysis of simple geometries containing tungsten-rhenium alloys engrained with uranium dioxide and uranium mononitride	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								The critical mass and dimensions of simple geometries containing highly enriched uranium dioxide (UO(2)) and uranium mononitride (UN) encapsulated in tungsten-rhenium alloys are determined using MCNP5 criticality calculations. Spheres as well as cylinders with length to radius ratios of 1.82 are computationally built to consist of 60 vol.% fuel and 40 vol.% metal matrix. Within the geometries, the uranium is enriched to 93 wt.% uranium-235 and the rhenium content within the metal alloy was modeled over the range of 0-30 at.%. The spheres containing UO(2) were determined to have a critical radius of 18.29-19.11 cm and a critical mass ranging from 366 kg to 424 kg. The cylinders containing UO(2) were found to have a critical radius ranging from 17.07 cm to 17.84cm with a corresponding critical mass of 406-471 kg. Spheres engrained with UN were determined to have a critical radius ranging from 14.82 cm to 15.19 cm and a critical mass between 222 kg and 242 kg. Cylinders which were engrained with UN were determined to have a critical radius ranging from 13.81 cm to 14.15 cm and a corresponding critical mass of 245-267 kg. The critical geometries were also computationally submerged in a neutronically infinite medium of fresh water to determine the effects of rhenium addition on criticality accidents due to water submersion. The Monte Carlo analysis demonstrated that rhenium addition of up to 30 at.% can reduce the excess reactivity due to water submersion by up to $5.07 for UO(2) fueled cylinders, $3.87 for UO(2) fueled spheres and approximately $3.00 for UN fueled spheres and cylinders.

A model for fission gas release and gaseous swelling of the uranium dioxide fuel coupled with the FALCON code	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							HIGH-BURNUP FUEL; UO2 FUELS; BEHAVIOR; KINETICS; BUBBLES; GROWTH	A comprehensive model GRSW-A was developed to analyse the processes of fission gas release, gaseous swelling and microstructural evolutions in the uranium dioxide fuel during base irradiation and under transient conditions. The GRSW-A analysis incorporates a number of models published in open literature, as well as some original models that were already published by the authors elsewhere. Consequently, only the most prominent aspects of GRSW-A and its coupling with the FALCON fuel behaviour analysis and licensing code are described in this paper. The analysis of fuel behaviour in the REGATE experiment is presented, which includes the base irradiation of the fuel segment in a PWR to a burn-up of about 50 MWd/kgU, which was followed by a power ramp in the SILOE research reactor. Besides, the generalized data on fission gas release (FGR) in PWR fuel during the base irradiation up to a burn-up of about 70 MWd/kgU is interpreted using coupled FALCON and GRSW-A. Moreover, a mechanistic interpretation of the published data for pellet swelling during the base irradiation up to a burn-up of 100 MWd/kgU is put forward. In all the cases, the coupled FALCON/GRSW-A analysis has shown the improved prediction capability compared to the original FALCON MOD01, which is achieved due to the account for the mutual effect of thermal and, in particular, high-burn-up-assisted mechanisms of fission gas release and swelling under steady-state and transient conditions.

Comparison of the effects of cadmium-shielded and boron carbide-shielded irradiation channel of the Ghana Research Reactor-1	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							INSTRUMENTAL ACTIVATION-ANALYSIS; EPITHERMAL NEUTRONS; ROCKS	The MCNP model for the Ghana Research Reactor-1 (GHARR-1) was redesigned to incorporate cadmium-shielded irradiation channel as well as boron carbide-shielded channel in one of the outer irradiation channels. Further investigations were made after initial work in the cadmium-shielded channel to consider the boron carbide-shielded channel and both results were compared to determine the best material for the shielded channel. Before arriving at the final design of only one shielded outer irradiation channel extensive investigations were made into several other possible designs; as all the other designs that were considered did not give desirable results of neutronic performance. The concept of redesigning a new MCNP model which has a shielded channel is to equip GHARR-1 with the means of performing efficient epithermal neutron activation analysis. The use of epithermal neutron activation analysis can be very useful in many experiments and projects (e.g. it can be used to determine uranium and thorium in sediment samples). After the simulation, a comparison of the results from the boron carbide-shielded channel model for the GHARR-1 and the epicadmium-shielded channel was made. The inner irradiation channels of the two designs recorded peak values of approximately 1.18 x 10(12) +/- 0.0036 n/cm(2) s, 1.32 x 10(12) +/- 0.0036 n/cm(2) s and 2.71 x 10(11) +/- 0.0071 n/cm(2) s for the thermal, epithermal and fast neutron flux, respectively. Likewise the outer irradiation channels of the two designs recorded peak values of approximately 7.36 x 10(11) +/- 0.0042 n/cm(2) s, 2.53 x 10(11) +/- 0.0074 n/cm(2) s and 4.73 x 10(10) +/- 0.0162 n/cm(2) s for the thermal, epithermal and fast neutron flux, respectively. The epicadmium design recorded a peak thermal flux of 7.08 x 10(11) +/- 0.0033 n/cm(2) s and an epithermal flux of 2.09 x 10(11) +/- 0.006 n/cm(2) s in the irradiation channel where the shield was installed. Also, the boron carbide design recorded no peak thermal flux but an epithermal flux of 1.18 x 10(11) +/- 0.0079 n/cm(2) s in the irradiation channel where the shield was installed. The final multiplication factor (kef) of the boron carbide-shielded channel model for the GHARR-1 was recorded as 1.00282 +/- 0.0007 while that of the epicadmium designed model was recorded as 1.00332 +/- 0.0007. Also, a final prompt neutron lifetime of 1.5237 x 10(-4) +/- 0.0008 s was recorded for the cadmium designed model while a value of 1.5245 x 10(-4) +/- 0.0008 s was recorded for the boron carbide-shielded design of the GHARR-1.

CFD simulation of particle deposition on an array of spheres using an Euler/Lagrange approach	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							MULTIPLE SPHERICAL TARGETS; TURBULENT-BOUNDARY-LAYER; AEROSOL-PARTICLES; LANGEVIN-EQUATION; CHANNEL FLOW; DISPERSION; IMPACTION	The Generation IV Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) is being considered as a promising concept to produce electricity or process heat with high efficiencies and unique safety features. The PBMR is a high-temperature, helium-cooled, graphite moderated reactor. The fuel elements consist of 6 cm diameter spherical graphite "pebbles" containing each thousands of uranium dioxide microspheres. As the pebbles continually rub against one another in the core, a significant quantity of graphite dust can be released in the reactor coolant system. These dust particles, which contain some amounts of fission products, are transported and deposited on pebbles as well as primary circuit surfaces. It is therefore of great safety interest to develop and benchmark numerical approaches for predicting deposition of dust particles in the various locations of the PBMR primary circuit. In this investigation, we use the ANSYS-Fluent CFD code to simulate particulate flows around linear arrays of spheres and compare deposition rates against experiments. It is found that the Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) combined with the Continuous Random Walk (CRW) to supply fluctuating velocity components predicts deposition rates that are generally within the scatter of the data. The methodology developed here can therefore be used to predict to first order the graphite dust deposition rates on pebbles in PBMR-type reactors. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Lead shielding is usually provided in these casks for arresting gamma rays and reducing hazardous emissions to the environment below permissible limits. During transportation, accidental fire may break out and cause melting of lead for a prescribed duration. The present analysis reports, for the first time, a comprehensive CFD analysis of the thermal behaviour of melting of lead under high Rayleigh number convection during the fire test. The study reveals a substantial influence of natural convection on the thermal state and melting behaviour of lead which may have a great bearing on the safety and security of public during transportation of cask.

Level-1, -2 and -3 PSA for AHWR	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								In nuclear reactor probabilistic safety analyses (PSAs), risk is usually defined by the frequency and magnitude of radioactive releases to the environment (Generic CANDU, 2002). An integrated Level-1, -2 and -3 PSA have been carried out for thorium based natural circulation driven advanced heavy water reactor (AHWR). A Level-1 PSA models accident sequences up to the point at which the reactor core either reaches a stable condition or becomes severely damaged, releasing large amounts of radionuclides into the containment. The probabilistic aspects of the analysis focus on the performance and reliability of nuclear plant systems and station staff in response to plant upsets. A Level-2 PSA examines severe reactor accidents through a combination of probabilistic and deterministic approaches, in order to determine the release of radionuclides from containment, including the physical processes that are involved in the loss of structural integrity of the reactor core (Generic CANDU, 2002). A Level-3 PSA goes through the short and long term (radiological) effects on the public (Fullwood, 2000). In this study the risk associated with internal events is only addressed. In the first phase, Level-1 PSA has been carried out to identify postulated initiating events (PIEs) which may lead to severe core damage (SCD) for the reactor. In the second phase, a Level-2 PSA examines two enveloping severe accidents through a combination of probabilistic and deterministic approaches and determines the release of radionuclides from containment. In the third phase, a Level-3 PSA is carried out for the transport of radionuclides through the environment and for the evaluation of public health risk for the two scenarios considered. The salient findings are presented in the paper. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Prasad, M.

This method is based upon the direct coupling of a code for nuclear fuel isotopic characterization (ORIGEN-S) to a model for proliferation resistance, based upon a generalized fuel cycle model. The resulting coupled model is applied to evaluate PR as a dynamic system property as a function of three fuel cycle categories: open cycles, a "modified open cycle" (MOC) consisting of limited actinide recycle, and a fully closed cycle. Proliferation resistance is evaluated along several key operational parameters of the chosen fuel cycles, including fuel burnup and actinide separation strategies (including uranium and minor actinide co-extraction). For purposes of demonstration, a PR model developed at NC State shall be used for fuel cycle PR evaluation; the mechanics of this model will be presented in brief. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The facility allows authorized distance users engaged in collaborative activities with Missouri S&T to remotely manipulate and analyze neutron irradiated samples. The system consists of two shielded compartments, one for multiple sample storage, and the other dedicated exclusively for radiation measurements and spectroscopy. The second chamber has multiple detector ports, with graded shielding, and has the capability to support gamma spectroscopy using radiation detectors such as an HPGe detector. Both these chambers are connected though a rapid pneumatic system with access to the MSTR nuclear reactor core. This new internet-based system complements the MSTR's current bare pneumatic tube (BM) and cadmium lined pneumatic tube (CPT) facilities. The total transportation time between the core and the hot cell, for samples weighing 10 g, irradiated in the MSTR core, is roughly 3.0 s. This work was funded by the DOE grant number DE-FG070-7ID14852 and expands the capabilities of teaching and research at the msTR. It allows individuals who do not have on-site access to a nuclear reactor facility to remotely participate in research and educational activities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Choi, HJ; Lee, M; Lee, JY				Choi, Heui-Joo; Lee, Minsoo; Lee, Jong Youl			Preliminary conceptual design of a geological disposal system for high-level wastes from the pyroprocessing of PWR spent fuels	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								The inventories of spent fuels are linearly dependent on the production of electricity generated by nuclear energy. Pyroprocessing of PWR spent fuels is one of promising technologies which can reduce the volume of spent fuels remarkably. The properties of high-level wastes from the pyroprocessing are totally different from those of spent fuels. A geological disposal system is proposed for the high-level wastes from pyroprocessing of spent fuels. The amount and characteristics of high-level wastes are analyzed based on the material balance of pyroprocessing. Around 665 kg of monazite ceramic wastes are expected from the pyroprocessing of 10 MtU of PWR spent fuels. Decay heat from monazite ceramic wastes is calculated using the ORIGEN-ARP program. Disposal modules consisting of storage cans, overpacks, and a deposition hole or a disposal tunnel are proposed. Four kinds of deposition methods are proposed. Thermal design is carried out with ABAQUS program and geological data obtained from the KAERI Underground Research Tunnel. Through the thermal analysis, the spacing between the disposal modules is determined for the peak temperature in buffer not to exceed 100 degrees C. Thermal analysis shows that the optimum spacing between the vertical deposition holes with 4 overpacks is 8 m when the disposal tunnel spacing is 40 m and optimum spacing of 2 m for horizontal disposal tunnel with 25 m tunnel spacing. Also, the spacing reduces to 6 m for vertical deposition when the double-layered buffer is used, which reduces the disposal area to one-sixty fifth (1/65th) compared with the direct disposal of spent fuels. Finally, the effect of cooling time on the disposal area is illustrated. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Analysis of uncertainties and detection limits for the double measurement method of Sr-90 and Sr-89	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article						(SrSr)-Sr-90-Sr-89; Radioactivity measurement; Detection limit; Uncertainty		The determination process of the Sr-90 and Sr-89 contents in a sample, although it involves their radiochemical isolation, results always in a complex measurement process due to the interferences among their respective beta emissions and also among those of the daughter of Sr-90, Y-90, a beta emitter as well. In this paper, the process consisting in a double measurement method after the Sr radiochemical isolation is analyzed, developing the formulae to obtain activity concentrations, uncertainties and detection limits. A study of the trend of uncertainties and detection limits as function of the time in which the first measurement since the isolation is done, the delay between the two measurements and the activity concentration of each strontium isotope in the sample is carried out as well. Results show that with a very precise determination of the times involved in the whole process (isolation, measurement and duration of measurements) this method permits a reliable assessment of both strontium radioisotopes. The quicker the first measurement since the isolation is done and the longer the delay between measurements is chosen, the lower are the detection limits and the uncertainties of the activities obtained.

Assessment of natural radioactivity and mass attenuation coefficients of brick and roofing tile used in Turkey	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article						Brick and roofing tile; Radioactivity; Mass attenuation coefficients; Chemical analysis; XRD; Turkey	RADON EXHALATION RATES; BUILDING-MATERIALS; BY-PRODUCTS; RADIONUCLIDE CONTENT; RADIATION HAZARDS; CONSTRUCTION; BANGLADESH; DWELLINGS; ENERGY	In this study the distribution of natural radionuclides ((226)Ra, (232)Th, (40)K) in brick and roofing tile samples commonly used as building materials in Turkey was measured by using gamma spectrometry. The activity concentrations, radium equivalent activities (Ra(eq)), representative level index, indoor absorbed dose rate in air values and annual effective dose due to the intake of the above-mentioned radionuclides in the brick and roofing tile samples were estimated to assess the radiation hazard for people living in dwellings made of the materials studied. The measured average activity concentrations of (226)Ra, (232)Th and (40)K were 34 +/- 14, 34 +/- 13 and 462 +/- 175 Bq.kg(-1), respectively, for brick samples. For roofing tile, the average activity concentrations of (226)Ra, (232)Th and (40)K were measured to be 34 +/- 14, 33 +/- 12 and 429 +/- 161 Bq.kg(-1), respectively. The concentrations for these natural radionuclides were compared with the reported data of other countries. The Ra(eq) values of all samples were lower than the limit of 370 Bq.kg(-1), equivalent to a gamma dose of 1.5 mSv.a(-1) recommended by OECD. This study shows that the measured brick and roofing tile samples do not pose any significant source of radiation hazard and are safe to be used as building materials. Moreover, the experimental mass attenuation coefficients (mu/rho) of brick and roofing tile samples were determined in the energy range 80-1332 keV using the gamma ray transmission method. The experimental mass attenuation coefficients were compared with theoretical values obtained using XCOM. It was found that the computed values and the experimental results of this work are in good agreement with those reported in the literature. The chemical compositions and structural analysis (XRD) of the brick and roofing tile samples are also presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The effect of lattice and grain boundary diffusion on the redistribution of Xe in metallic nuclear fuels: Implications for the use of ion implantation to study fission-gas-bubble nucleation mechanisms	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							URANIUM-DIOXIDE; HEAVY-ION; XENON; UO2; IRRADIATION; KRYPTON; TEMPERATURE; TEM; PROFILES; BEHAVIOR	A multi-atom gas bubble-nucleation mechanism has been proposed as part of a predictive fission-gas release model for metallic nuclear fuels. Validation of this mechanism requires experimental measurement of fission-gas bubble-size distributions at well-controlled gas concentrations and temperatures. There are advantages to carrying out such a study using ion implantation as the source of gas atoms compared with neutron irradiations. In spite of previous successes using ion implantation to study fission-gas behavior in oxide fuels, there is significant uncertainty about the efficacy of using ion beams for metallic fuel studies. To address the question of the applicability of ion beams in experiments designed to study fission-gas behavior in metallic fuels, we developed and applied an exact model for the redistribution of implanted ions under annealing conditions. The conclusion is that, given the assumptions, the results from implantations at 1 MeV or less may be overwhelmed by the surface effects at all relevant temperatures. Implanting at 10 or 80 MeV can significantly diminish the influence of the surfaces and the steep concentration gradients. At 80 MeV, the location of the peak concentration profile remains stable with annealing time. Thus, it appears that ion implantation can be an appropriate tool to study the size distribution of Xe bubbles in metallic fuels. Of the conditions investigated, the best for the study are to implant at 80 MeV and carry out anneals at 773 K, 873 K, and 973 K for times less than 10,000 s. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Krypton irradiation damage in Nd-doped zirconolite and perovskite	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							ELECTRON-ENERGY-LOSS; ALPHA-RECOIL DAMAGE; X-RAY-ABSORPTION; ION IRRADIATION; DISPLACEMENT ENERGIES; INDUCED AMORPHIZATION; CRYSTAL ORIENTATION; NATURAL ZIRCONOLITE; LOSS SPECTROSCOPY; SILICATE-GLASSES	Understanding the effect of radiation damage and noble gas accommodation in potential ceramic hosts for plutonium disposition is necessary to evaluate their long-term behaviour during geological disposal. Polycrystalline samples of Nd-doped zirconolite and Nd-doped perovskite were irradiated ex situ with 2 MeV Kr+ at a dose of 5 x 10(15) ions cm(-2) to simulate recoil of Pu nuclei during alpha decay. The feasibility of thin section preparation of both pristine and irradiated samples by Focused Ion Beam sectioning was demonstrated. After irradiation, the Nd-doped zirconolite revealed a well defined amorphous region separated from the pristine material by a thin (40-60 nm) damaged interface. The zirconolite lattice was lost in the damaged interface, but the fluorite sublattice was retained. The Nd-doped perovskite contained a defined irradiated layer composed of an amorphous region surrounded by damaged but still crystalline layers. The structural evolution of the damaged regions is consistent with a change from orthorhombic to cubic symmetry. In addition in Nd-doped perovskite, the amorphisation dose depended on crystallographic orientation and possibly sample configuration (thin section or bulk). Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy revealed Ti remained in the 4+ oxidation state but there was a change in Ti coordination in both Nd-doped perovskite and Nd-doped zirconolite associated with the crystalline to amorphous transition.

J	Williamson, RL				Williamson, R. L.			Enhancing the ABAQUS thermomechanics code to simulate multipellet steady and transient LWR fuel rod behavior	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							CREEP; UO2	A powerful multidimensional fuels performance analysis capability, applicable to both steady and transient fuel behavior, is developed based on enhancements to the commercially available ABAQUS general-purpose thermomechanics code. Enhanced capabilities are described, including: UO2 temperature and burnup dependent thermal properties, solid and gaseous fission product swelling, fuel densification, fission gas release, cladding thermal and irradiation creep, cladding irradiation growth, gap heat transfer, and gap/plenum gas behavior during irradiation. This new capability is demonstrated using a 2D axisymmetric analysis of the upper section of a simplified multipellet fuel rod, during both steady and transient operation. Comparisons are made between discrete and smeared-pellet simulations. Computational results demonstrate the importance of a multidimensional, multipellet, fully-coupled thermomechanical approach. Interestingly, many of the inherent deficiencies in existing fuel performance codes (e.g., 1D thermomechanics, loose thermomechanical coupling, separate steady and transient analysis, cumbersome pre- and post-processing) are, in fact, ABAQUS strengths.

J	Veshchunov, MS				Veshchunov, M. S.			New models for UO2 fuel structure evolution under irradiation in fast reactors	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							GRAIN-GROWTH KINETICS; LENTICULAR PORES; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; GAS RELEASE; MIGRATION; MOVEMENT; RODS	On the base of analysis of experimental observations and critical assessment of existing models for oxide fuel structure evolution under operation conditions of fast reactors, new models for fuel restructuring and coring are proposed. The restructuring model describes coherent motion in the temperature gradient of various voids (gas bubbles, sintering pores and large lenticular pores) and grain boundaries, to which the voids are attached. As a result, the model explains elongation of thermally growing equiaxed grains and formation of columnar grains, and predicts a rapid formation of extended columnar grain zone during a relatively short initial period of fast reactor irradiation. The coring model describes formation and growth of the central void in the fuel pellet, activated by mass transport from the inner to the outer zone of the pellet under stresses induced by inhomogeneous fuel densification in the initial period of irradiation.

Fission-product behaviour in irradiated TRISO-coated particles: Results of the HFR-EU1bis experiment and their interpretation	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							GRAIN-GROWTH KINETICS; UO2 FUEL PELLETS; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; NEW-MODEL; BURN-UP; MIGRATION; TEMPERATURE; DIFFUSION; EVOLUTION; PROGRESS	It is important to understand fission-product (FP) and kernel micro-structure evolution in TRISO-coated fuel particles. FP behaviour, while central to severe-accident evaluation, impacts: evolution of the kernel oxygen potential governing in turn carbon oxidation (amoeba effect and pressurization); particle pressurization through fission-gas release from the kernel; and coating mechanical resistance via reaction with some FPs (Pd, Cs, Sr). The HFR-Eu1 bis experiment irradiated five HTR fuel pebbles containing TRISO-coated UO2 particles and went beyond current HTR specifications (e.g., central temperature of 1523 K). This study presents ceramographic and EPMA examinations of irradiated urania kernels and coatings. Significant evolutions of the kernel (grain structure, porosity, metallic-inclusion size, intergranular bubbles) as a function of temperature are shown. Results concerning FP migration are presented, e.g., significant xenon, caesium and palladium release from the kernel, molybdenum and ruthenium mainly present in metallic precipitates. The observed FP and micro-structural evolutions are interpreted and explanations proposed. The effect of high flux rate and high temperature on fission-gas behaviour, grain-size evolution and kernel swelling is discussed. Furthermore, Cs, Mo and Zr behaviour is interpreted in connection with oxygen-potential. This paper shows that combining state-of-the-art post-irradiation examination and state-of-the-art modelling fundamentally improves understanding of HTR fuel behaviour. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Shaaban, I; Assi, N				Shaaban, Ismail; Assi, Nasim			Measurement of the leaching rate of radionuclide Cs-134 from the solidified radioactive sources in Portland cement mixed with microsilica and barite matrixes	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							SILICA-FUME	Portland cement was mixed with radionuclide Cs-134 to produce low-level radioactive sources. These sources were surrounded with cement mixed with different materials like microsilica and barite. The leaching rate of Cs-134 from the solidified radioactive source in Portland cement alone was found to be 4.481 x 10(-4) g/cm(2) per day. Mixing this Portland cement with microsilica and with barite reduced significantly the leaching rate to 1.091 x 10(-4) g/cm(2) per day and 3.153 x 10(-4) g/cm(2) per day for 1 wt.% mixing, and to 1.401 X 10(-5) g/cm(2) per day and 1.703 x 10(-4) g/cm(2) per day for 3 wt.% mixing, respectively. It was also found that the application of a latex paint reduced these leaching rates by about 6.5%, 20.3% and 13.3% for Portland cement, cement mixed with microsilica and with barite, respectively. The leaching data were also analyzed using the polynomial method. The obtained results showed that cement mixed with microsilica and with barite can be effectively used for radioactive sources solidification. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

COPERNICUS: A multi-cycle optimization code for nuclear fuel based on parallel simulated annealing with mixing of states	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Advances in Nuclear Fuel Management IV (ANFMIV)	APR 12-15, 2009	Hilton Head Isl, SC			Nuclear Fuel; Multi-cycle; Optimization; Parallel Simulated Annealing	MANAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION	COPERNICUS is the Studsvik code for performing nuclear fuel optimization over a multi-cycle planning horizon that provides for an implicit coupling between traditionally separate in-core and out-of-core fuel management decisions. These decisions include determination of: fresh fuel region size; sub-region enrichments and bundle designs; exposed fuel re-use; and core loading pattern. The COPERNICUS methodology is based on a parallel implementation of the Simulated Annealing optimization algorithm, modified by the technique of Mixing of States, that allows for deployment in a processor scalable environment. COPERNICUS utilizes the 3-D licensing grade code SIMULATE for evaluation of all core loading pattern constraints, such as those involving reactivity and thermal margin requirements. Results are presented for a transition cycle design that compares performance of multi-cycle optimization to successive, single cycle optimization with regard to reducing levelized fuel costs.

The plutonium and minor actinides are obtained from the recycling of the spent fuel of a BWR, and are mixed with depleted uranium obtained from the enrichment tails. The design and optimization of the equilibrium reload is achieved in two steps. In the first step, the fuel assembly is adjusted and the reload pattern is designed, in order to obtain the target cycle length. In order to improve the shutdown margin, two actions were taken: to increase the boron-10 content in the control rods, and to add a burnable absorber (gadolinia) in some fuel rods. In the second step, the reload pattern, obtained in the first step, is optimized to maximize the energy, under the thermal and reactivity margins constraints; a system based on Genetic Algorithms was used in the optimization process. Results show that 5% more energy was obtained with the optimized reload. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A minimum hot excess core design strategy for ESBWR	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Advances in Nuclear Fuel Management IV (ANFMIV)	APR 12-15, 2009	Hilton Head Isl, SC			Fuel cycle; Core design; Reactivity; ESBWR; Hot excess		The Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR) is GEH's next evolution of advanced BWR technology. There are 1132 fuel bundles in the core and the thermal power is 4500 MWt. As part of design simplification it uses natural circulation flow with no recirculation pumps or their associated piping. The control blades are the primary control mechanism to address the need for performing reactivity adjustments (using fine-motion drives) at or near rated steady state power. This introduces the potential for duty-related fuel failure, which has to be rigorously addressed as part of reliable design and operation. As means to mitigate this potential for duty-related fuel failure and also to support a simplified ESBWR operation, this study investigates the feasibility of a fuel cycle core design strategy. The objective is to design fuel bundles, and to use them for developing a core design, that minimizes (but does not eliminate) the use of control blades during operation. The reduction in use is envisioned in their number as well as movement in the core. in such a strategy, the effect of the burnable poison in the fuel (that largely drives the core reactivity) is enhanced, and operationally the control blades react modestly to maintain the core critical. While the logic is simple, challenges exist in developing such a design because it needs to balance the requirement for having enough blade inventory in the core to address design/operational constraints and uncertainties. The strategy is conceptualized as "minimum hot excess (reactivity)" design. It reduces the number of blades in the core during normal operation by 50% in comparison to a similar fuel cycle core design with regular inventory of control blades. Because of the increased burnable poison, the minimum hot excess core design strategy comes at a cost of fuel cycle efficiency. This cost is determined in terms of an increased enrichment for the fresh fuel batch fraction. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Bjork, KI; Fhager, V; Demaziere, C				Bjork, Klara Insulander; Fhager, Valentin; Demaziere, Christophe			Comparison of thorium-based fuels with different fissile components in existing boiling water reactors	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Advances in Nuclear Fuel Management IV (ANFMIV)	APR 12-15, 2009	Hilton Head Isl, SC			Thorium; BWR; Neutronics		With the aim of investigating the technical feasibility of fuelling a conventional BWR (Boiling Water Reactor) with thorium-based fuel, computer simulations were carried out in a 2D infinite lattice model using CASMO-5. Four different fissile components were each homogenously combined with thorium to form mixed oxide pellets: Uranium enriched to 20% U-235 (LEU), plutonium recovered from spent LWR fuel (RGPu), pure U-233 and a mixture of RGPu and uranium recovered from spent thorium-based fuel. Based on these fuel types, four BWR nuclear fuel assembly designs were formed, using a conventional assembly geometry (GE14-N). The fissile content was chosen to give a total energy release equivalent to that of a UOX fuel bundle reaching a discharge burnup of about 55 MWd/kgHM. The radial distribution of fissile material was optimized to achieve low bundle internal radial power peaking. Reactor physical parameters were computed, and the results were compared to those of reference LEU and MOX bundle designs. It was concluded that a viable thorium-based BWR nuclear fuel assembly design, based on any of the fissile components, can be achieved. Neutronic parameters that are essential for reactor safety, like reactivity coefficients and control rod worths, are in most cases similar to those of LW and MOX fuel. This is also true for the decay heat produced in irradiated fuel. However when Th is mixed with U-233, the void coefficient (calculated in 2D) can be positive under some conditions. It was concluded that it is very difficult to make savings of natural uranium by mixing LEU (20% U-235) homogenously with thorium and that mixing RGPu with thorium leads to more efficient consumption of Pu compared to MOX fuel.

High-fidelity system modeling of advanced nuclear energy systems approaching a zero-nuclear-waste limit	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Advances in Nuclear Fuel Management IV (ANFMIV)	APR 12-15, 2009	Hilton Head Isl, SC			Fusion-fission hybrid; High-fidelity modeling; AP1000; VHTR; Transuranics		This paper will present a high-fidelity system analysis of advanced nuclear energy systems approaching a zero-nuclear-waste limit. The focus will be on achievable performance characteristics. The applied high-fidelity system modeling approach will be discussed with illustrations using obtained physics simulation results. The near-term deployable dedicated small 14 MeV-neutron waste incineration back-end clean-up facilities are envisioned as advanced incinerators that are used in combination with thermal reactors (Westinghouse AP1000 and Generation IV VHTR are considered in the present study) to minimize the remaining long-lived radioactive species. These 14 MeV transmuters are viewed as small facilities designed to reduce waste inventories prior to reprocessing stages minimizing spent fuel activity levels and repository requirements. It is envisioned that under sustainable nuclear energy scenario small clean-up facilities will eventually evolve into self-consistent complexes producing electricity and serving as energy sources for industrial applications. The paper discusses physics features of these advanced systems and challenges of their conclusive evaluations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Allen, K; Knight, T; Bays, S				Allen, Kenneth; Knight, Travis; Bays, Samuel			Benchmark of Advanced Burner Test Reactor model using MCNPX 2.6.0 and ERANOS 2.1	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Advances in Nuclear Fuel Management IV (ANFMIV)	APR 12-15, 2009	Hilton Head Isl, SC			Transmutation; Transuranic; Minor actinide; MCNPX; ERANOS; Fast reactor		Significant research is currently being performed whereby fast reactor cores have been designed to burn transuranic materials reducing the volume and long-term radiotoxicity of spent nuclear fuel. These core and depletion models depend on various computer codes. This research used MCNPX 2.6.0 and ERANOS 2.1 to model a standard 250 MW Advanced Burner Test Reactor (ABTR) core. The intent was to benchmark criticality and burnup results from a stochastic Monte Carlo code and a deterministic depletion code using a standard ABTR model created by Argonne National Laboratory. Because each of these codes solves the transport and burnup problem differently, there is a need to benchmark the core models in order to verify results and identify root causes for significant differences in results between codes. Flux calculations in ERANOS were performed using diffusion theory, Legendre polynomial approximations (using the VARIANT module) and discrete ordinates methods. The k-effective for the higher order transport models remained within 1000 pcm of the MCNPX model. The difference between the total heavy nuclide mass balance in ERANOS using the various flux calculations and the MCNPX depletion model was less than 0.4% out to a burnup of 1095 days (67.45 GWd/MTHM). The percent delta between the codes as a. fraction of the fissioned mass was 1.34%. For the isotopes with large concentrations, such as (238)U and (239)Pu, the mass differences were 0.38% and 0.01% respectively. The mass difference for (241)Am was also small at 0.42%. Notable isotopes in small quantities with larger mass differences were (242)Am, (242)Cm, (243)Cm and (246)Cm where differences ranged from 0.1 to 0.2% after 26 days and increased to 11-136% at 1095 days.
