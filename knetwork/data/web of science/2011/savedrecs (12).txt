Neutron threshold activation detectors (TAD) for the detection of fissions	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Fast neutron detection; Fission prompt neutrons; Nuclear material detection; Delayed fission gamma rays; Neutron scintillation detectors; Photofission		Prompt fission neutrons are one of the strongest signatures of the fission process. Depending on the fission inducing radiation, their average number ranges from 2.5 to 4 neutrons per fission. They are more energetic and abundant, by about 2 orders of magnitude, than the delayed neutrons ( approximate to 3 vs. approximate to 0.01) that are commonly used as indicators for the presence of fissionable materials. The detection of fission prompt neutrons, however, has to be done in the presence of extremely intense probing radiation that stimulated them. During irradiation, the fission stimulation radiation, X-rays or neutrons, overwhelms the neutron detectors and temporarily incapacitate them. Consequently, by the time the detectors recover from the source radiation, fission prompt neutrons are no longer emitted. In order to measure the prompt fission signatures under these circumstances, special measures are usually taken with the detectors such as heavy shielding with collimation, use of inefficient geometries, high pulse height bias and gamma-neutron separation via pulse-shape discrimination with an appropriate organic scintillator. These attempts to shield the detector from the flash of radiation result in a major loss of sensitivity. It can lead to a complete inability to detect the fission prompt neutrons. In order to overcome the blinding induced background from the source radiation, the detection of prompt fission neutrons needs to occur long after the fission event and after the detector has fully recovered from the source overload. A new approach to achieve this is to detect the delayed activation induced by the fission neutrons. The approach demonstrates a good sensitivity in adverse overload situations (gamma and neutron "flash") where fission prompt neutrons could normally not be detected. The new approach achieves the required temporal separation between the detection of prompt neutrons and the detector overload by the neutron activation of the detector material. The technique, called Threshold Activation Detection (TAD), is to utilize appropriate substances that can be selectively activated by the fission neutrons and not by the source radiation and then measure the radioactively decaying activation products (typically beta and gamma rays) well after the source pulse. The activation material should possess certain properties: a suitable half-life of the order of seconds; an energy threshold below which the numerous source neutrons will not activate it (e.g., 3 MeV); easily detectable activation products (typically > 1 MeV beta and gamma rays) and have a usable cross-section for the selected reaction. Ideally the substance would be a part of the scintillator. There are several good material candidates for the TAD, including fluorine, which is a major constituent of available scintillators such as BaF(2), CaF(2) and hydrogen free liquid fluorocarbon. Thus the fluorine activation products, in particular the beta particles, can be measured with a very high efficiency in the detector. The principles, applications and experimental results obtained with the fluorine based TAD are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Boron-coated straws as a replacement for He-3-based neutron detectors	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Radiation portal monitoring; Long-range detection; Active interrogation		US and international government efforts to equip major seaports with large area neutron detectors, aimed to intercept the smuggling of nuclear materials, have precipitated a critical shortage of He-3 gas. It is estimated that the annual demand of He-3 for US security applications alone is more than the worldwide supply. This is strongly limiting the prospects of neutron science, safeguards, and other applications that rely heavily on He-3-based detectors. Clearly, alternate neutron detection technologies that can support large sensitive areas, and have low gamma sensitivity and low cost must be developed. We propose a low-cost technology based on long copper tubes (straws), coated on the inside with a thin layer of B-10-enriched boron carbide ((B4C)-B-10). In addition to the high abundance of boron on Earth and low cost of B-10 enrichment, the boron-coated straw (BCS) detector offers distinct advantages over conventional He-3-based detectors, and alternate technologies such as (BF3)-B-10 tubes and B-10-coated rigid tubes. These include better distribution inside moderator assemblies, many-times faster electronic signals, no pressurization, improved gamma-ray rejection, no toxic or flammable gases, and ease of serviceability. We present the performance of BCS detectors dispersed in a solid plastic moderator to address the need for portal monitoring. The design adopts the outer dimensions of currently deployed He-3-based monitors, but takes advantage of the small BCS diameter to achieve a more uniform distribution of neutron converter throughout the moderating material. We show that approximately 63 BCS detectors, each 205 cm long, distributed inside the moderator, can match or exceed the detection efficiency of typical monitors fitted with a 5 cm diameter He-3 tube, 187 cm long, pressurized to 3 atm.

A cost effective, highly sensitive, passive neutron fluence monitor for nuclear contraband detection	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Aluminium oxide TLD; Non-He-3 based neutron detector; Nuclear contraband; Passive neutron fluence monitor; Reactor grade plutonium; Terrorist attack		Natural gadolinium possesses a very high thermal neutron capture (n, gamma) cross-section on the other hand, carbon-doped aluminium oxide thermoluminescence dosimeters (alpha-Al2O3:C), available as TLD 500 are extremely responsive to gamma rays. Hence, by combining those two unique phenomena we have developed a highly sensitive passive neutron detector. The lowest detectable (fission) neutron fluence rate was evaluated to be 7.1 neutrons cm(-2) s(-1) for an integration period of 1 h. This detection level is adequate enough to detect 3 g of Pu-240 from a distance of 1 m, producing spontaneous fission neutrons. Application of this neutron fluence monitor in the passive detection of nuclear contraband is suggested. Further developmental work aiming to augment the present device with instantaneous data display and alarm actuation capabilities is ongoing. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Actinide-loaded glass scintillators for fast neutron detection	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Fast neutron detector; Actinide-doped glass scintillator		Fast neutron detection has applications in a number of topic areas, including national security and nuclear fuel cycle safeguards. Ideally, these sensors would have high sensitivity to fission (fast) neutrons but be insensitive to thermal neutrons and gamma rays. This paper describes a study of actinide-loaded glass for fast neutron detection, wherein a threshold fission reaction in the actinide produces fission products depositing approximately 200 MeV of energy. The prominent advantage of this approach to fast neutron detection, when compared to fission chambers, is the potential for several orders of magnitude increase in the mass of fissionable atoms per unit volume-thereby improving the absolute detection efficiency and offsetting the small (approximately 1 barn) threshold cross-sections. The detectors tested to date are glass-matrix based, loaded with thorium and a rare-earth activator. The threshold cross-section for fission of (232)Th (100% natural abundance) provides insensitivity to thermal neutrons, but the primary research question is whether the 200 MeV of energy released per fission is sufficiently distinct, in terms of total scintillation light and/or scintillation decay time, to be clearly distinguished from gamma rays and the inherent alpha emissions in the actinide. The high density of ionization and resulting propensity for recombination is expected to reduce the scintillation production well below that corresponding to 200 MeV electron equivalent. Technical challenges to be overcome in the fabricating actinide-loaded glasses and the testing of these early samples are significant. These include making a glass containing thorium and the proper activator that will scintillate, discriminating fast neutron events from the natural radioactivity of 232Th and its daughters and minimizing the severity of the non-linearity of energy to light conversion for the fission fragments. The first obstacle has been overcome; scintillating glass samples containing thorium have been produced and spectra on these samples have been acquired. These spectra as well as initial tests of fast neutron detection are presented here, along with a discussion of the research paths to be explored in the future. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A new approach to the analysis of alpha spectra based on neural network techniques	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Artificial neural network; ANN; Alpha; Fitting; Spectrum; Analysis	PARTICLE SPECTRA; DETECTORS	The analysis of alpha spectra requires good radiochemical procedures in order to obtain well differentiated alpha peaks in the spectrum, and the easiest way to analyze them is by directly summing the counts obtained in the Regions of Interest (ROls). However, the low-energy tails of the alpha peaks frequently make this simple approach unworkable because some peaks partially overlap. Many fitting procedures have been proposed to solve this problem, most of them based on semiempirical mathematical functions that emulate the shape of a theoretical alpha peak. The main drawback of these methods is that the great number of fitting parameters used means that their physical meaning is obscure or completely lacking. We propose another approach the application of an artificial neural network. Instead of fitting the experimental data to a mathematical function, the fit is carried out by an artificial neural network (ANN) that has previously been trained to model the shape of an alpha peak using as training patterns several polonium spectra obtained from actual samples analyzed in our laboratory. In this sense, the ANN is able to learn the shape of an actual alpha peak. We have designed such an ANN as a feed-forward multi-layer perceptron with supervised training based on a back-propagation algorithm. The fitting procedure is based on the experimental observables that are characteristic of alpha peaks the number of counts of the maximum and several peak widths at different heights. Polonium isotope spectra were selected because the alpha peaks corresponding to (208)Po, (209)Pn, and (210)Po are monoenergetic and well separated. The uncertainties introduced by this fitting procedure were less than the counting uncertainties. This new approach was applied to the problem of resolving overlapping peaks. Firstly, a theoretical study was carried out by artificially overlapping alpha peaks from actual samples in order to test the ability of the ANN to resolve each peak. Then, the ANN procedure was checked by determining the activity levels of different spectra obtained from certified samples for which one knows a priori the radioactive content, and its results were compared with those of other methods.

Time-of-flight energy compensation to improve energy resolution in low-energy radioactive beam experiments at the TwinSol facility	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Radioactive beams; Exotic beams; Ion-beam time of flight; Coulomb excitation	ION-BEAMS; DETECTORS	Improved time-of-flight (ToF) capability has been added to the University of Michigan (UM)-University of Notre Dame (UND) TwinSol low-energy dual 6T solenoid-based radioactive nuclear-beam (RNB) facility at the UND FN tandem Van de Graaff accelerator. An extended low-background beam line has been combined with a newly-constructed ca.1 meter diameter ISO-250 based scattering chamber capable of sub-ns ToF of RNBs. These together with the intrinsic, low ToF spread in the TwinSol ion-optical system yields improved ToF information for low-energy RNB nuclear reaction studies. Using either the intrinsic accelerator bunched and pulsed-selected beams with RF timing, or with the addition of an MCP+foil timing system (or similar) detector at the dual-solenoid cross-over region allows for reduction of the energy spread inherent in these low-energy RNB reactions. As an example, using the ToF information reduces the FWHM energy spread in a high-intensity 28 MeV Li-8 beam from about 1 MeV to < ca. 600 keV or more without excessive collimation (which reduces the beam). This has been utilized in a recent experiment measuring the Coulomb excitation of a short-lived Li-8 RNB on gold targets. The use of ToF permitted a much more efficient measurement of this reaction as certain background measurements were no longer needed and the full Li-8 beam intensity could be utilized. A number of other improvements are planned to further improve the ToF resolution and count-rate limits of the various ToF systems and we hope to utilize these in the future. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Experimental validation of a coupled neutron-photon inverse radiation transport solver	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Gamma spectrometry; Neutron multiplicity counting; Radiation transport; Inverse problems		Sandia National Laboratories has developed an inverse radiation transport solver that applies nonlinear regression to coupled neutron-photon deterministic transport models. The inverse solver uses nonlinear regression to fit a radiation transport model to gamma spectrometry and neutron multiplicity counting measurements. The subject of this paper is the experimental validation of that solver. This paper describes a series of experiments conducted with a 4.5 kg sphere of a-phase, weapons-grade plutonium. The source was measured bare and reflected by high-density polyethylene (HDPE) spherical shells with total thicknesses between 1.27 and 15.24 cm. Neutron and photon emissions from the source were measured using three instruments: a gross neutron counter, a portable neutron multiplicity counter, and a high-resolution gamma spectrometer. These measurements were used as input to the inverse radiation transport solver to evaluate the solver's ability to correctly infer the configuration of the source from its measured radiation signatures.

Simulation of polyethylene-moderated plutonium neutron multiplicity measurements	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Monte Carlo; MCNP-PoliMi; Neutron multiplicity		Neutron multiplicity measurements are a useful technique for the characterization of special nuclear material. This technique relies on the detection of correlated neutrons from fission events. As correlated events are detected it is possible to determine the neutron multiplicity distribution for the sample. This distribution is useful for identifying the material and estimating the mass. This work focuses on the ability of the Monte Carlo code MCNP-PoliMi to simulate measured distributions. The experiment used as the basis of comparison consisted of a 4.5 kg plutonium metal sphere surrounded by up to 6 in. of polyethylene. A bank of 15 (3)He detectors was used to detect the correlated neutron events. MCNP-PoliMi was used to simulate the particle transport and a post-processing algorithm was developed to apply detector deadtime effects and to determine the neutron multiplicity distributions. These simulated distributions were then compared to the measured results. The simulation provided an adequate estimation of the measured data. However, we observed a systematic over-prediction in both the mean and the variance of the measured distribution. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Miller, E. C.; Dennis, B.; Clarke, S.

There is widespread interest in improved methods for analyzing spectral data acquired with such devices, using inverse analysis. Peak means and peak areas in gamma- and X-ray spectra are needed for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. This paper introduces the PEAKSI code package that was developed at the Center for Engineering Applications of Radioisotopes (CEAR). The basic approach described here is to use accurate forward models and iterative convolution instead of direct deconvolution. Rather than smoothing and differentiation a combination of linear regression and non-linear searching is used to minimize the reduced chi-square, since this approach retains the capability of establishing uncertainties in the estimated peak parameters. The PEAKS! package uses a Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) non-linear search method combined with multiple linear regression (MLR) to minimize the reduced chi-square value for fitting single or multiple overlapping peaks to determine peak parameters, including peak means, peak standard deviations or full width at half maximum (FWHM), net peak counts, and background counts of peaks in experimental gamma-ray spectra. This approach maintains the natural error structure so that parameter uncertainties can be estimated. The plan is to release this code to the public in the near future. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A dual-sided coded-aperture radiation detection system	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Coded-aperture imaging; Standoff radiation detection; Radiation imaging systems	LARGE-AREA	We report the development of a large-area, mobile, coded-aperture radiation imaging system for localizing compact radioactive sources in three dimensions while rejecting distributed background. The 3D Stand-Off Radiation Detection System (SORDS-3D) has been tested at speeds up to 95 km/h and has detected and located sources in the millicurie range at distances of over 100 m. Radiation data are imaged to a geospatially mapped world grid with a nominal 1.25- to 2.5-m pixel pitch at distances out to 120 m on either side of the platform. Source elevation is also extracted. Imaged radiation alarms are superimposed on a side-facing video log that can be played back for direct localization of sources in buildings in urban environments. The system utilizes a 37-element array of 5 x 5 x 50 cm(3) cesium-iodide (sodium) detectors. Scintillation light is collected by a pair of photomultiplier tubes placed at either end of each detector, with the detectors achieving an energy resolution of 6.15% FWHM (662 key) and a position resolution along their length of 5 cm FWHM. The imaging system generates a dual-sided two-dimensional image allowing users to efficiently survey a large area. Imaged radiation data and raw spectra are forwarded to the RadioNuclide Analysis Kit (RNAK), developed by our collaborators, for isotope ID. An intuitive real-time display aids users in performing searches. Detector calibration is dynamically maintained by monitoring the potassium-40 peak and digitally adjusting individual detector gains. We have recently realized improvements, both in isotope identification and in distinguishing compact sources from background, through the installation of optimal-filter reconstruction kernels.

GAMPIX: A new generation of gamma camera	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Gamma imaging; Medipix2; Coded mask	PHOTON-COUNTING MODE; PIXEL READOUT CHIP; CARTOGAM; MEDIPIX2; ENERGY	Gamma imaging is a technique of great interest in several fields such as homeland security or decommissioning/dismantling of nuclear facilities in order to localize hot spots of radioactivity. In the nineties, previous works led by CEA LIST resulted in the development of a first generation of gamma camera called CARTOGAM, now commercialized by AREVA CANBERRA. Even if its performances can be adapted to many applications, its weight of 15 kg can be an issue. For several years, CEA LIST has been developing a new generation of gamma camera, called GAMPIX. This system is mainly based on the Medipix2 chip, hybridized to a 1 mm thick CdTe substrate. A coded mask replaces the pinhole collimator in order to increase the sensitivity of the gamma camera. Hence, we obtained a very compact device (global weight less than 1 kg without any shielding), which is easy to handle and to use. In this article, we present the main characteristics of GAMPIX and we expose the first experimental results illustrating the performances of this new generation of gamma camera.

A SPECT camera for combined MRI and SPECT for small animals	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						SPECT; MRI; Molecular imaging; Multi-modality imaging		We describe an MR-compatible SPECT camera for small animals. The SPECT camera system can be inserted into the bore of a state-of-the-art MRI system and allows researchers to acquire tomographic images from a mouse in-vivo with the MRI and the SPECT acquiring simultaneously. The SPECT system provides functional information, while MRI provides anatomical information. Until today it was impossible to operate conventional SPECT inside the MRI because of mutual interference. The new SPECT technology is based on semiconductor radiation sensors (CZT, ASICs), and it fits into conventional high field MRI systems with a minimum 12-cm bore size. The SPECT camera has an MR-compatible multi-pinhole collimator for mice with a 025-mm field-of-view. For the work reported here we assembled a prototype SPECT camera system and acquired SPECT and MRI data from radioactive sources and resolution phantoms using the camera outside and inside the MRI.

The characterization of their pharmacokinetics requires blood radioactivity monitoring over time during the scan and is very challenging in small animals because of the low volume of blood available. In this work, a prototype microfluidic blood counter made of a microchannel atop a silicon substrate containing PIN photodiodes is proposed to improve beta detection efficiency in a small volume by eliminating unnecessary interfaces between fluid and detector. A flat rectangular-shaped epoxy channel, 36 mu m x 1.26 mm cross section and 31.5 mm in length, was microfabricated over a die containing an array of 2 x 2 mm(2) PIN photodiodes, leaving only a few micrometers of epoxy floor layer between the fluid and the photodiode sensitive surface. This geometry leads to a quasi 2D source, optimizing geometrical detection efficiency that was estimated at 41% using solid angle calculation. CV-IV measurements were made at each fabrication step to confirm that the microchannel components had no significant effects on the diodes' electrical characteristics. The chip was wire-bonded to a PCB and connected to charge sensitive preamplifier and amplifier modules for pulse shaping. Energy spectra recorded for different isotopes showed continuous beta distribution for PET isotopes and monoenergetic conversion electron peaks for (99m)Tc. Absolute sensitivity was determined for the most popular PET and SPECT radioisotopes and ranged from 26% to 33% for PET tracers ((18)F, (13)N, (11)C, (68)Ga) and more than 2% for (99m)Tc. Input functions were successfully simulated with (18)F, confirming the setup's suitability for pharmacokinetic modeling of PET and SPECT radiotracers in animal experiments. By using standard materials and procedures, the fabrication process is well suited to on-chip microfluidic functionality, allowing full characterization of new radiotracers. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore it is necessary to perform quality control tests in the gamma camera before running the exam to prevent false results. Quality control tests of the gamma camera should thus be performed before running the exam to prevent false results. Such tests generally use radioactive material inside phantoms for evaluation of gamma camera parameters in quality control procedures. Phantoms can also be useful for training doctors and technicians in nuclear medicine procedures. The phantom proposed here has artifacts that simulate nodules; it may take on different quantities, locations and sizes and it may also be mounted without the introduction of nodules. Thus, its images may show hot or cold nodules or no nodules. The phantom consists of acrylic plates hollowed out in the centre, with the geometry of an adult liver. Images for analyses of simulated liver scintigraphy were obtained with the detector device at 5 cm from the anterior surface of the phantom. These simulations showed that this object is suitable for quality control in nuclear medicine because it was possible to visualize artifacts larger than 7.9 mm using a 256 x 256 matrix and 1000 kcpm. The phantom constructed in this work will also be useful for training practitioners and technicians in order to prevent patients from repeat testing caused by error during examinations.

Effect of fulvic acids on the electrolytes physiology in vertebrates	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Fulvic acids effect; Physiology; Vertebrates	IONS	Fulvic acids are the active principle in humus fertilizers which are the cause of better absorption of mineral ions from soil to plant tissues. Tested in mice by making use of radioactive labeled ions, they showed their action of enhancing by a factor greater than two the filtration through liver of PO(4)(3-) and Ca(2)(+) from digestive tract to blood serum as well as through kidney from blood serum to urine. Following this research, Fe(3+) and I(1-) ions labeled with (59)Fe and (131)I have been tested and reported in the present paper. Results showed that iron ions are completely fixed in red cells, with no residue eliminated by urine, while iodine ions are fixed in thyroid gland, with some residue eliminated by urine. Both ions were fixed in said tissues by factors larger than two when they are escorted by fulvic acids. A general distribution of these ions in blood, urine, feces, liver, kidney and thyroid gland has been surveyed, trying to find the earliest effect of fulvic acids in the physiology of vertebrates.

Filters of Mo and Al of suitable thickness were added to the tube exit, in order to reproduce the radiation qualities of an X-ray mammographic equipment, as recommended by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC 61267) and the Physikalisch-Technischen Bundesanstalt (PTB). A detailed evaluation of the detector response functions was made using Monte Carlo simulations. The validity of this method was tested through comparisons with the experimental spectra of radioactive sources. The results showed that the Si(Li) detector exhibits good response function in low energy (between 5 and 20 key). The measured X-ray spectra for a Mo filtration (0.03 mm thickness), corrected using the response functions, show a good agreement with the reference clinical spectra. The results of this work also show that both the radiation qualities implemented and the spectra shape are consistent with that obtained for mammographic X-ray beams, and they can be applied to calibration of the mammography measurements instruments (e.g. ionization chambers and dosimeters).

Petrophysical analysis of limestone rocks by nuclear logging and 3D high-resolution X-ray computed microtomography	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						X-ray; Rock; Nuclear logging; Tomography; Petrophysics; Porosity		This study presents the pore-space system analysis of the 2-ITAB-1-RJ well cores, which were drilled in the Sao Jose do Itaborai Basin, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brasil. The analysis presented herein has been developed based on two techniques: nuclear logging and 3D high-resolution X-ray computed microtomography. Nuclear logging has been proven to be the technique that provides better quality and more quantitative information about the porosity using radioactive sources. The Density Gamma Probe and the Neutron Sonde used in this work provide qualitative information about bulk density variations and compensated porosity of the geological formation. The samples obtained from the well cores were analyzed by microtomography. The use of this technique in sedimentary rocks allows quantitative evaluation of pore system and generates high-resolution 3D images (similar to microns order). The images and data obtained by microtomography were integrated with the response obtained by nuclear logging. The results obtained by these two techniques allow the understanding of the pore-size distribution and connectivity, as well as the porosity values. Both techniques are important and they complement each other. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Oliveira, M. F. S.; Lima, I.; Lopes, R.

Radionuclide measurements, via different methodologies, as tool for geophysical studies on Mt. Etna	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Radionuclides; Radon detection	RADON EMANATION; ACTIVE FAULTS; SOIL-GAS	Natural radioactivity measurements represent an interesting tool to study geodynamical events or soil geophysical characteristics. In this direction we carried out, in the last years, several radionuclide monitoring both in the volcanic and tectonic areas of the oriental Sicily. In particular we report in-soil Radon investigations, in a tectonic area, including both laboratory and in-site measurements, applying three different methodologies, based on both active and passive detection systems. The active detection devices consisted of solid-state silicon detectors equipped in portable systems for short-time measurements and for long-time monitoring. The passive technique consisted of solid-state nuclear track detectors (SSNTD), CR-39 type, and allowed integrated measurements. The performances of the three methodologies were compared according to different kinds of monitoring. In general the results obtained with the three methodologies seem in agreement with each other and reflect the tectonic settings of the investigated area. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Study of natural radioactivity in riverbank soils along the Chao Phraya river basin in Thailand	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Natural radioactivity; Gamma-ray spectrometry; Soil; Naturally occurring radioactive nuclides	FOODSTUFFS; SAMPLES; CYPRUS; EGYPT	Levels of naturally occurring radioactivity in surface soils along the Chao Phraya river have been investigated. The activity concentrations of radionuclides in the (238)U and (232)Th decay chains and from (40)K were determined through gamma-ray spectrometry measurements made using a hyperpure germanium detector in a low background configuration. Activity concentrations of (238)U, (232)Th and (40)K were found to be 55.3 +/- 1.2 <-> 65.2 +/- 1.4, 60.7 +/- 1.2 <-> 69.1 +/- 1.3 and 393 +/- 13 <-> 478 +/- 16 Bq/kg, respectively. Concerning radiological risk, the absorbed gamma dose rate in air from those soils was estimated to lie in the range 81.6 +/- 1.9 <-> 90.4 +/- 2.1 nGy/h; the outdoor annual effective dose equivalent was calculated to be 100.1 +/- 2.3 <-> 110.8 +/- 2.5 mu Sv/yr. These results are compared with radioactivity measurements with world mean values. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Santawamaitre, T.; Malain, D.; Al-Sulaiti, H. A.; Bradley, D.

Fiber-optic radiation sensor for detection of tritium	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Fiber-optic sensor; Tritium; Beta ray; Inorganic scintillator; Radiation detector	BEAM THERAPY DOSIMETRY; OPTICAL-FIBER	The objective of this study is to develop the radiation sensor, which is composed of a scintillator, an optical fiber bundle and a light measuring device to detect the tritium in real-time. In this study, we have fabricated fiber-optic radiation sensors using inorganic scintillators and plastic optical fiber bundles. Each scintillator interacts with electron or beta ray and generates 455-550 nm wavelength of scintillation photons. An optical fiber bundle is usually made of plastic or glass, which is used to guide the light signal from a scintillating probe to light measuring device. For the purpose of selecting the best scintillator with a high efficiency, fiber-optic sensors manufactured using three kinds of inorganic scintillator such as Gd(2)O(2)S:Tb, Y(3)Al(5)O(12):Ce and Csl:Tl, and they are tested with a metal hydride type of tritium source. In addition, the scintillation photons are measured as a function of distance between a fiber-optic sensor and source. Finally, we have measured the amounts of scintillation photon with different activities of tritium source and compared the measured results with those obtained using a surface activity monitor.

The COCAE Detector: An Instrument for Localization-Identification of Radioactive Sources	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						CdTe detectors; CdZnTe detectors; Compton imaging; gamma-ray cameras	CDZNTE DETECTORS; CDTE; CAMERA; RAY	The COCAE project develops an instrument for localization and identification of radioactive sources. For the localization task it will exploit the Compton scattered photons within its detecting layers. It is based on pixilated Cd(Zn) Te matrices in a stacked configuration. Progress has been achieved in all the components necessary for this technology. CdZnTe crystals have been grown of up to 75 mm in diameter. A wafer level pixelization process has been tested and its results will be presented. Angular resolution for directional identification of the order of 6 requires energy resolution better than 5%. For this reason we have investigated planar metal-p-n diodes fabricated by using laser-induced solid phase doping and Schottky diodes created by Ar-ion etching of the Cd(Zn) Te surfaces before deposition of Ni electrodes. The energy resolution achieved is better than 1% FWHM @662 KeV. The development of a pixel CMOS readout integrated circuit has been undertaken. It outputs in digital format address, energy and time information for the pixels which have collected charge above a given threshold. Simulation studies of the minimum detection limits, of the Compton sequencing algorithms, of the angular resolution and of the reconstruction of the radioactive source position have been performed. Experiments with a precursor setup using an existing hybrid detector are underway.	[Lambropoulos, C.

J	Das, S; Das, S; Gupta, A				Das, Saptarshi; Das, Shantanu; Gupta, Amitava			Fractional Order Modeling of a PHWR Under Step-Back Condition and Control of Its Global Power With a Robust (PID mu)-D-lambda Controller	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Control rod; fractional order controller; model reduction; NIOPTD; reactor control; system identification	HEAVY-WATER REACTOR; NUCLEAR-REACTOR; SPATIAL CONTROL; DESIGN	Bulk reduction of reactor power within a small finite time interval under abnormal conditions is referred to as step-back. In this paper, a 500 MWe Canadian Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) type Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) is modeled using few variants of Least Square Estimator (LSE) from practical test data under a control rod drop scenario in order to design a control system to achieve a dead-beat response during a stepped reduction of its global power. A new fractional order (FO) model reduction technique is attempted which increases the parametric robustness of the control loop due to lesser modeling error and ensures iso-damped closed loop response with a (PID mu)-D-lambda or FOPID controller. Such a controller can, therefore, be used to achieve active step-back under varying load conditions for which the system dynamics change significantly. For closed loop active control of the reduced FO reactor models, the (PID mu)-D-lambda controller is shown to perform better than the classical integer order PID controllers and present operating Reactor Regulating System (RRS) due to its robustness against shift in system parameters.

One design change relative to current Westinghouse reactors of similar size is that AP1000 reactor vessel has two nozzles/hot legs instead of three. With regard to fuel performance, this design difference creates a different flow field in the reactor vessel upper plenum. The flow exiting from the core and entering the upper plenum must turn toward one of the two outlet nozzles and flow laterally around numerous control rod guide tubes and support columns. Also, below the upper plenum are the upper core plate and the top core region of the 157 fuel assemblies and 69 guidetube assemblies. To determine how the lateral flow in the top of the core and upper plenum compares to the current reactors a CFD model of the flow in the upper portion of the AP1000 reactor vessel was created. Before detailed CFD simulations of the flow in the entire upper plenum and top core regions were performed, conducting local simulations for smaller sections of the domain provided crucial and detailed physical aspects of the flow. These sub-domain models were used to perform mesh sensitivities and to assess what geometrical details may be eliminated from the larger model in order to reduce mesh size and computational requirements. In this paper. CFD analysis is presented for two subdomain models: the top core region and control rod guide tube region. These models are chosen for simulation because guide tube and top core region (including top grid, top nozzle, and hold-down device) are the major components of upper plenum effecting the flow patterns and pressure distribution. The top core region, corresponding to 1/4 of fuel assembly, includes components as upper part of the fuel assemblies (top grid, fuel rods, top nozzle), core component hold-down devices, and upper core plates. These components distribute the core flow to different sections of guidetube regions. Mesh sensitivity studies have been conducted for each individual part in order to determine the proper geometrical simplifications. Pressure drop measurement data are compared with the predicted CFD results and act as a guideline for the mesh selection. The guidetube region includes control rod guidetubes themselves, adjacent support columns and open regions. In this study, two models of subdomains are analyzed: (1) a 1/4 section of one control rod guide tube by itself and (2) a representative unit cell containing two 1/4 sections of adjacent control rod guide tubes and one 1/4 section of a neighboring support column. Predicted flow rates at each of the outflow locations in conjunction with results from the mesh sensitivity studies provide guidance on (1) what geometry to preserve or remove, (2) what geometry can be simplified to reduce the required mesh, and (3) an estimate of the total mesh required to model the entire upper plenum and top fuel domain. The commercial CFD code STAR-CCM+ is employed to generate the computational mesh, to solve the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flow with a Realizable k-epsilon turbulence model, and to post-process the results.

Effective thermal conductivity of a heat generating rod bundle dissipating heat by natural convection and radiation	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							SPENT-FUEL ASSEMBLIES; ENCLOSURES	A numerical study of conjugate natural convection and surface radiation in a horizontal hexagonal sheath housing 19 solid heat generating rods with cladding and argon as the fill gas, is performed. The natural convection in the sheath is driven by the volumetric heat generation in the solid rods. The problem is solved using the FLUENT CFD code. A correlation is obtained to predict the maximum temperature in the rod bundle for different pitch-to-diameter ratios and heat generating rates. The effective thermal conductivity is related to the heat generation rate, maximum temperature and the sheath temperature. Results are presented for the dimensionless maximum temperature, Rayleigh number and the contribution of radiation with changing emissivity, total wattage and the pitch-to-diameter ratio. In the simulation of a larger system that contains a rod bundle, the effective thermal conductivity facilitates simplified modelling of the rod bundle by treating it as a solid of effective thermal conductivity. The parametric studies revealed that the contribution of radiation can be 38-65% of the total heat generation, for the parameter ranges chosen. Data for critical Rayleigh number above which natural convection comes into effect is also presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Senve, Vinay; Narasimham, G. S. V.

J	Sun, QN; Li, JF; Wang, JL				Sun, Qina; Li, Junfeng; Wang, Jianlong			Effect of borate concentration on solidification of radioactive wastes by different cements	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							SULFOALUMINATE CEMENT; COMPLEX CHEMISTRY; PORTLAND-CEMENT; RESINS; IMMOBILIZATION; EFFICIENCY; RETARDERS; MATRICES; BLENDS; CESIUM	To investigate the effect of borate on the cementation of radioactive evaporator concentrates, and to provide more data for solidification formula optimization, the simulated borate evaporator concentrates with different borate concentrations (as B) and Na/B ratio (molar ratio) were solidified by sulfoaluminate cement (SAC) and Portland cement (PC), with addition of Ca(OH)(2), zeolite and accelerator or water reducer. The hydration products of solidified matrices were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The experimental results showed that borate retarded the cement setting for both SAC and PC formulas, and the final setting time prolonged with decrease of Na/B ratio. Borate could enhance the fluidity of the cement mixture. The 28 d compressive strengths of the solidified matrices for both SAC and PC formulas decreased with increase of borate concentration. The XRD patterns suggested that, in the matrices maintained for 28 d, borate did not interfere with the formation of main hydration products of SAC and PC. Borate, in the form of B(OH)(4-), incorporated in ettringite (3CaO center dot Al(2)O(3)center dot 3CaSO(4)center dot 32H(2)O) as solid solution phase. The formula of SAC and PC developed in this study was effective for cementation of the simulated borate evaporator concentrates. However further optimization was required to reduce retarding effect of higher borate concentrations and to extend the practical feasibility for actual evaporator concentrates. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

PET Demonstrator for a Human Brain Scanner Based on Monolithic Detector Blocks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Application specific integrated circuit; artificial neural networks; position sensitive detectors; positron emission tomography	DESIGN	We have implemented and evaluated a positron emission tomography (PET) demonstrator using two monolithic detector blocks operating in coincidence with dedicated application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) readout. Each detector is composed of a monolithic lutetium yttrium orthosilicate (LYSO) scintillator coupled to a pair of Hamamatsu S8550-02 APD arrays. The front-end electronics of this demonstrator is based on the VATA240 ASIC readout, which sums the charge provided by each row and column of the APD array. The ASIC has been characterized obtaining a noise per row or column less than 2000 electrons rms with the APD at its inputs and a good linear response in the range from 5 fC to 30 fC. We have acquired energy spectra of (22)Na and (137)Cs radioactive sources, achieving energy resolutions between 13.2% and 14.1% full width at half maximum (FWHM) at 511 keV. We have estimated the interaction position over the surface of the monolithic blocks using Neural Networks (NN) position determining algorithms, obtaining spatial resolutions at the detector level down to 2.1 mm FWHM. By using this detector technology and electronics we have achieved images of point sources with spatial resolutions as good as 2.1 mm FWHM for filtered back projection (FBP) reconstructions methods with single slice rebinning (SSRB). Based on the results obtained with this demonstrator, we are developing a PET insert for existing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) equipment, to be installed in a collaborating hospital and used for clinical PET-MRI of the human brain.

Towards Quantification of Functional Breast Images Using Dedicated SPECT With Non-Traditional Acquisition Trajectories	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Image processing; nuclear imaging; single photon emission computed tomography	SCATTERED PHOTONS; RECONSTRUCTION; COMPENSATION; TOMOGRAPHY	Quantification of radiotracer uptake in breast lesions can provide valuable information to physicians in deciding patient care or determining treatment efficacy. Physical processes (e. g., scatter, attenuation), detector/collimator characteristics, sampling and acquisition trajectories, and reconstruction artifacts contribute to an incorrect measurement of absolute tracer activity and distribution. For these experiments, a cylinder with three syringes of varying radioactivity concentration, and a fillable 800 mL breast with two lesion phantoms containing aqueous (99m)Tc pertechnetate were imaged using the SPECT sub-system of the dual-modality SPECT-CT dedicated breast scanner. SPECT images were collected using a compact CZT camera with various 3D acquisitions including vertical axis of rotation, 30 tilted, and complex sinusoidal trajectories. Different energy windows around the photopeak were quantitatively compared, along with appropriate scatter energy windows, to determine the best quantification accuracy after attenuation and dual-window scatter correction. Measured activity concentrations in the reconstructed images for syringes with greater than 10 mu Ci/mL corresponded to within 10% of the actual dose calibrator measured activity concentration for +/- 4% and +/- 8% photopeak energy windows. The same energy windows yielded lesion quantification results within 10% in the breast phantom as well. Results for the more complete complex sinsusoidal trajectory are similar to the simple vertical axis acquisition, and additionally allows both anterior chest wall sampling, no image distortion, and reasonably accurate quantification.

J	Issard, H; Abadie, P				Issard, Herve; Abadie, Pascale			AGING TESTS OF NEUTRON-SHIELDING MATERIALS FOR TRANSPORT OF STORAGE CASKS	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						neutron shielding; aging tests; storage		Dry storage cask materials must withstand severe temperature conditions coming from conservative ambient assumptions and from envelope values of residual heat from spent fuels. TN International (TN!) research and development has consequently developed and characterized neutron-shielding materials that show high shielding capabilities and correspond to the needs of a range of temperatures. Aging tests of specimens have been performed accordingly. This paper shows the results of aging tests on shielding material Vyal-B, a material patented by TNI. TNI Vyal-B shielding material is composed of a thermoset resin matrix (vinylester resin in solution of styrene) and two mineral fillers (alumina hydrate and zinc borate). The cross-linking of the polymer leads to a rigid three-dimensional lattice, solid and resistant to transport conditions, especially the temperatures. TNI Vyal-B's shielding ability for neutron radiation is related to the atomic density of hydrogen and boron. Atomic densities can be calculated from the chemical composition and bulk density of samples, and these two parameters are checked initially just after manufacturing. Assessment of the long-term behavior of TNI Vyal-B shielding material has been carried out through exposition tests of samples at different temperatures (150 degrees C to 170 degrees C). The test results give the variations of chemical composition and density. After the aging tests, the new chemical compositions are taken into account in the shielding analysis of the package. Considering a degradation mechanism following Arrhenius behavior, a maximal temperature of long-term use, for example, for interim storage, was confirmed equal to 160 degrees C.

In addition, reduction of the maximum boron concentration in a PWR is a practical and feasible means to substantially reduce the radiation dose to operators and to minimize corrosion damage. Four types of integral burnable absorbers have been considered: gadolinium, integral fuel burnable absorber (IFBA), erbia, and alumina boron carbide. Under consideration of four different kinds of fuel assemblies (FA), four core design candidates were developed by applying current PWR OPR-1000 technology and by keeping major engineering design constraints and the equivalent fuel enrichment level used in the reference core (REF) design. However, an optimal design was targeted to achieve comparable discharge burnup as well as favorable design safety parameters. The comparative analysis between the REF and the optimal core designs is presented here. One of the designs is suggested as the most promising and favorable low boron core (LBC) design in this framework. The proper combination of axial and radial enrichment zoning patterns plus a mixture of fresh FAs with depleted assemblies in an LBC design candidate with an IFBA-bearing FA at equilibrium cycle could bring a two times narrower axial offset variation than that of the REF design, maintain an acceptable power peaking factor similar to 23% lower than the design limit, and achieve higher fuel burnup. It was observed that this optimal LBC design could comply with current OPR-1000 reactor acceptance criteria associated with smooth reactivity swing, more flattened power distribution, and desired limiting safety parameters despite an 18% loss of shutdown reactivity worth at beginning of cycle when compared to the REF design.

ANALYSIS OF THE BR2 LOSS-OF-FLOW TEST A	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						loss of flow; flow reversal; natural convection	CONVECTION	The simulation of the BR2 test A/400/1 was undertaken to support the safety analysis of the conversion of the BR2 research reactor to low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel and to extend the validation basis of the RELAP code for analysis of the conversion of research reactors from highly enriched fuel to LEU. This test was characterized by a steady-state peak heat flux of 400 W/cm(2), total loss of flow without loss of system pressure, reactor scram, flow reversal, and reactor cooling by natural convection. This paper presents the RELAP analysis of test A/400/1 and the comparison of code predictions with experimental measurements of peak cladding temperatures during the transient at different axial locations in an instrumented fuel assembly. The simulations show that accurate representation of the pump coastdown characteristics and of the power distribution, especially after reactor scram, between the fuel assemblies and the moderator/reflector regions are critical for correct prediction of the peak cladding temperatures during the transient.

Here, the Levenberg-Marquardt (or simply "Marquardt") method, a standard gradient-based optimization technique, is applied to the inverse transport problems of interface location identification, shield material identification, source composition identification, and material mass density identification (both separately and combined) in multilayered radioactive source/shield systems. One-dimensional spherical problems using leakage measurements of neutron-induced gamma-ray lines and two-dimensional cylindrical problems using flux measurements of uncollided passive gamma-ray lines are considered. Gradients are calculated using an adjoint-based differentiation technique that is more efficient than difference formulas. The Marquardt method is iterative and directly estimates unknown interface locations, source isotope weight fractions, and material mass densities, while the unknown shield material is identified by estimating its macroscopic gamma-ray cross sections. Numerical test cases illustrate the utility of the Marquardt method using both simulated data that are perfectly consistent with the optimization process and realistic data simulated by Monte Carlo.

The most dominant neutron source among the spontaneous fission nuclides contained in spent fuel is Cm-244. To obtain the neutron counting rates of the singles, doubles, and triples coincidences of the neutron counter with an increment of the Cm-244 mass, a hot test of the neutron counter was performed in 2007 with several spent fuel rod-cuts in the ACPF hot cell. The source term of the spent fuel rod-cuts was obtained using the ORIGEN-ARP burnup simulation code, and a set of preliminary calibration curves of the neutron counter for Cm-244 was generated. The calibration curves were also obtained from the results of an MCNPX code simulation, but there was a wide difference of similar to 30% in the slope of the double-rate calibration curve between the measurements and the MCNPX results. Chemical analysis results of the spent fuel samples were obtained in September 2008, and it was found that the difference between the measurements and the MCNPX results is due to an error in the declared burnup since the chemical analysis burnups of the samples differ from the declared ones by similar to 10%. The expected burnup of each rod-cut was also obtained from the results of self-multiplication correction for the Cm-244 mass of the rod-cuts, and the difference between the expected burnup results and the chemical analysis results is <2%. This study shows high performance of the neutron coincidence counter for Cm-244 measurements of spent fuel and also shows that the burnup of spent fuel samples can be obtained through a series of ORIGEN-ARP code simulations if it is possible to acquire the measurement data of neutron counting rates for (244)cm of the samples.

Actinide breeding and reactivity variation in a thermal spectrum ADSR - Part 1: Development of a lumped thermal reactor model	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Thorium; Pressurised water reactor; Actinide evolution; Thermal spectrum	TRANSMUTATION	The beneficial properties of fast reactor systems in being able to both burn and breed actinides have led to renewed interest in this technology as a means of providing a more sustainable form of nuclear power production. However, despite significant investment over many years in the development of the technology, fast reactors have never been deployed in significant numbers. In view of the difficulties encountered in fast reactor development, enhancements to the existing, well proven light water reactor (LWR) technology may provide a more accessible path to improved sustainability. In this context, this paper describes the development of a reactor model for the purposes of examining performance of a typical pressurised water reactor (PWR) as a means by which extended fuel cycles and reduced waste production may be achieved in a thermal spectrum accelerator driven subcritical reactor (ADSR). This is achieved using a homogeneous lumped thermal reactor model that can simulate the evolution of actinides in a typical PWR to first-order accuracy. The accuracy of the model's predictions is compared with the analysis of samples taken from operational PWRs. Although the model provides only first-order accuracy, it offers the advantage that it can calculate in seconds the evolution of nuclides which might otherwise take significantly longer using more elaborate models. The model provides a means by which the limitations and constraints affecting the operation of critical thermal reactors can be examined in Part 2 of this paper. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Actinide breeding and reactivity variation in a thermal spectrum ADSR - Part 2: Enhanced sustainability in the thermal spectrum	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Thorium; Accelerator-driven subcritical reactors; Neutron economy; Actinide evolution; Thermal spectrum		For more sustainable nuclear power to be realised improvements will be needed in the efficiency with which energy is derived from the remaining finite uranium reserves, while at the same time delivering reductions in the quantities of long-lived actinides contained within the spent fuel. The use of fast reactors to achieve this is the subject of renewed interest due to their beneficial capability to both burn and breed transuranic actinides. However, fast reactors have a mixed track record and have never been deployed in significant numbers despite considerable investment in the development of the technology over many years. In light of these difficulties, future advances in nuclear technology may be more readily realised through enhancements to the existing, well proven light water reactor (LWR) technology base. In this context, this paper examines the possible improvements in actinide breeding and burning that could be achieved through the addition of an accelerator to a typical pressurised water reactor (PWR) in the form of a thermal accelerator-driven subcritical reactor (ADSR). This is done using a lumped model that can calculate to first-order accuracy the evolution of actinides in a typical PWR. The balance of neutron production versus neutron absorption is examined as the nuclide composition within the reactor evolves as a function of burn-up. The use of pure and enriched uranium and thorium fuel sources are investigated, and the ability to maintain power generation by the addition of an accelerator is demonstrated. Thorium fuel is shown to have a significantly superior neutron economy in the thermal spectrum compared to that of a (238)U based system. The additional neutron source provided by the accelerator can enable extended operation when using enriched uranium oxide fuel and, in the case of thorium fuel platforms, closed or near-closed cycles may be possible. However, based on current technologies, the size and cost of accelerator necessary to deliver such advances may prove to be prohibitive. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The criticality evaluation plays a considerable role in the design of voloxidation apparatus. As conservative results are always preferred in a criticality evaluation, an optimized model was built in consideration of both the geometry of voloxidation apparatus and the occurring forms of evaluation material. The criticality evaluation of fresh UO(2) fuel and PWR spent fuel were then performed by employing Monte Carlo techniques, respectively. It is demonstrated that there is no criticality risk concerning the voloxidation process dealing with fresh UO(2) or PWR spent fuel if water does not intrude into the cell. However, if water intrudes and mixes with the fuels, the subcritical mass limit is 40.1 +/- 0.1 kg for fresh UO(2) and 19,155 +/- 50 kg for spent fuel. The contributions of (1)H and (235)U were analyzed quantitatively by the TSUNAMI code to clarify the competition between (1)H moderation effect and its dilution effect on the concentration of (235)U.

By combining the Fixed Field Alternating Gradient (FFAG) accelerator with the thorium-loaded system at KUCA, a series of the ADS experiments is carried out under conditions whereby the spallation neutrons are generated at a tungsten target by 100 MeV protons at an intensity of 30 pA. Prompt neutron behavior in the time evolution is observed and thorium fission reactions are attained through the experiments and calculations, respectively. And the effects of neutron leakage and spectrum softening are experimentally observed through the neutron multiplication and reaction rate analyses. From the experimental and numerical analyses, in the future, experimental conditions need to be improved to attain further neutron multiplication using the variation of fuels (thorium, highly-enriched and natural uranium) and moderators (graphite, polyethylene, aluminum and beryllium).

In this circumstance, the overpotential of polarization in the cathode will become large and the conductivity will become much lower with reducing the temperature. A novel type of La(2)Ni(x)M(1-x)O(4) (x = 0.2-0.5) (M = Cu, Co) perovskite-like oxide was synthesized and studied as the cathode for low-temperature, 400-600 degrees C, solid oxide fuel cells. The microstructure, electrical conductivity and fuel cell performances are investigated. The substitution of Cu or Co for Ni in the perovskite-like oxide improved the electrical conductivity of the cathode materials. The maximum power density 312mWcm(-2) with the perovskite-like oxide cathode was obtained in the low temperature, 550 degrees C. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Plutonium uptake and distribution in mammalian cells: Molecular vs. polymeric plutonium	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						PC12 cells; plutonium polymer; molecular plutonium; X-ray fluorescence microscopy	PC12 CELLS; ACTINIDE SPECIATION; RAT-LIVER; TEST-SITE; TRANSFERRIN; RETENTION; BLOOD; OXIDE; NANOPARTICLES; CONTAMINATION	Purpose: To study the cellular responses to molecular and polymeric forms of plutonium using PC12 cells derived from a rat pheochromocytoma. Materials and methods: Serum starved PC12 cells were exposed to polymeric and molecular forms of plutonium for 3 h. Cells were washed with 10 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 100 mM NaCl at pH 7.4 to remove surface sorbed plutonium. Localization of plutonium in individual cell was quantitatively analyzed by synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (XRF) microscopy. Results: Molecular plutonium complexes introduced to cell growth media in the form of nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), citrate, or transferrin complexes were taken up by PC12 cells, and mostly colocalized with iron within the cells. Aged polymeric plutonium prepared separately was not internalized by PC12 cells but it was always found on the cell surface as big agglomerates; however, polymeric plutonium formed in situ was mostly found within the cells as agglomerates. Conclusions: PC12 cells can differentiate molecular and polymeric forms of plutonium. Molecular plutonium is taken up by PC12 cells and mostly co-localizes with iron but aged polymeric plutonium is not internalized by the cells.

The target was irradiated for 4 months in 2006 at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland. Gas samples were extracted in various phases of operation and analyzed by gamma spectroscopy, leading to the determination of the main radioactive isotopes released from the LBE. Comparison with calculations performed using several validated codes (MCNPX2.5.0/CINDER'90, FLUKA/ORIHET, and SNT) yields the ratio between simulated in-target isotope production rates and experimental amounts released at any given time. This work underlines the weak points of spallation models for some released isotopes. Also, results provide relevant information for safety and radioprotection in an accelerator-driven system and more particularly for the gas management in a spallation target dedicated to neutron production facilities.

The samples were irradiated at various positions on the surface of a two-ring orientation instrument with a 20-cm radius centered at the deuterium-tritium neutron source. The (27)Al(n, alpha)(24)Na reaction was used to monitor the neutron fluence in the target samples. The neutron energies of different directions were determined using the ratio of (89)Zr to (92m)Nb specific activities induced in Zr and Nb foils by (n, 2n) reactions. The (n, 2n) products were measured using a calibrated Ge detector. Experimental uncertainty was within +/- 4%. The results are presented and compared with the results of references and ENDF/B-VII.0 evaluations. Cross sections of (85)Rb(n, 2n)(84)Rb, (140)Ce(n, 2n)(139)Ce, and (89)Y(n, 2n)(88)Y were in good agreement with those of ENDF/B-VII.0 evaluations; however, disagreements were observed for (175)Lu(n, 2n)(174)Lu and (142)Ce(n, 2n)(141)Ce between the present data and the ENDF/B-VII.0 evaluation file. The present data showed improvement in accuracy in comparison with previously reported data; therefore, the results should be offered for evaluations of neutron (n, 2n) cross sections.

J	Bledsoe, KC; Favorite, JA; Aldemir, T				Bledsoe, Keith C.; Favorite, Jeffrey A.; Aldemir, Tunc			Application of the Differential Evolution Method to Solving Inverse Transport Problems	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							STRATEGY; OPTIMIZATION; SCATTERING; DESIGN	The differential evolution method, a powerful stochastic optimization algorithm that mimics the process of evolution in nature, is applied to inverse transport problems with several unknown parameters of mixed types, including interface location identification, source composition identification, and material mass density identification, in spherical and cylindrical radioactive source/shield systems. In spherical systems, measurements of leakages of discrete gamma-ray lines are assumed, while in cylindrical systems, measurements of scalar fluxes of discrete lines at points outside the system are assumed. The performance of the differential evolution algorithm is compared to the Levenberg-Marquardt method, a standard gradient-based technique, and the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy, another stochastic technique, on a variety of numerical test problems with several (i.e., three or more) unknown parameters. Numerical results indicate that differential evolution is the most adept method for finding the global optimum for these problems. In spherical geometry, differential evolution implemented serially is run-time competitive with gradient-based methods, while a parallel version of differential evolution would be run-time competitive with gradient-based techniques in cylindrical geometry. A hybrid differential evolution/Levenberg-Marquardt method is also introduced, and numerical results indicate that it can be a fast and robust optimizer for inverse transport problems.
