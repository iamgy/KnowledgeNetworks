J	Uwaba, T; Ito, M; Maeda, K				Uwaba, Tomoyuki; Ito, Masahiro; Maeda, Koji			Diametral strain of fast reactor MOX fuel pins with austenitic stainless steel cladding irradiated to high burnup	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							CESIUM MIGRATION; FISSION-GAS; PERFORMANCE; CREEP; BEHAVIOR; PELLETS	The C3M irradiation test, which was conducted in the experimental fast reactor, "Joyo", demonstrated that mixed oxide (MOX) fuel pins with austenitic steel cladding could attain a peak pellet burnup of about 130 GWd/t safely. The test fuel assembly consisted of 61 fuel pins, whose design specifications were similar to those of driver fuel pins of a prototype fast breeder reactor, "Monju". The irradiated fuel pins exhibited diametral strain due to cladding void swelling and irradiation creep. The cladding irradiation creep strain were due to the pellet-cladding mechanical interaction (PCMI) as well as the internal gas pressure. From the fuel pin ceramographs and (137)Cs gamma scanning, it was found that the PCMI was associated with the pellet swelling which was enhanced by the rim structure formation or by cesium uranate formation. The PCMI due to cesium uranate, which occurred near the top of the MOX fuel column, significantly affected cladding hoop stress and thermal creep, and the latter effect tended to increase the cumulative damage fraction (CDF) of the cladding though the CDF indicated that the cladding still had some margin to failure due to the creep damage.

The implantation temperature has been varied between room temperature and 1000 degrees C. Samples were characterized using Rutherford backscattering/channeling and X-ray diffraction. We observed that (1) YSZ remains partially crystalline even after Fe implantation at room temperature and the lattice damage can be partially recovered if implantation is performed at elevated temperatures: (2) crystalline bcc-Fe nanoparticles have formed and grown with increasing implantation temperature. The nanoscale Fe precipitates and the YSZ matrix have a crystallographic orientation relationship. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The radiation sources for this facility are two plates of highly enriched uranium situated in the moderator vessel in FRM II. Thermal neutrons originating from the main fuel element of the reactor generate in these plates fast neutrons. These can escape through a horizontal beam tube without moderation. The beam can be filtered and manipulated in order to reduce the accompanying gamma radiation and to match the specific experimental tasks. A summary of the main parameters required for experimental set-up and (quantitative) data evaluation is presented. The (measured) spectra of the neutron and gamma radiations are shown along with the effect of different filters on their behavior. The neutron and gamma fluxes, dose rates, L/D-ratios, etc. and the main parameters of the actually used detection systems for neutron imaging are given, too. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This detection procedure gives a quasi-rectangular energy deposition distribution for mono-energetic neutrons, extending from zero to the neutron energy. However, if the detector sensitive element (DSE) is small, the energy deposition may be incomplete due to the recoil proton escape. In the application of neutron imaging, here exemplified by fast-neutron tomography, two conflicting requirements have been identified: (1) thin DSEs are required to obtain high spatial resolution and (2) energy discrimination may be required to reduce the influence of neutrons being scattered into the DSEs, which generally occurs at lower energies. However, at small DSE widths, the reduction of energy deposition due to recoil proton escape may cause a significant decrease in detection efficiency when energy discrimination is applied. In this work, energy deposition distributions in small-size DSEs have been simulated for Deuterium-Deuterium (DD; 2.5 MeV) and Deuterium-Tritium (DT; 14.1 MeV) fusion neutrons. The intrinsic efficiency has been analyzed as a function of energy discrimination level for various detector widths. The investigations show that proton recoil escape causes a significant drop in intrinsic detection efficiency for thin DSEs. For DT neutrons, the drop is 10% at a width of 3.2 mm and 50% at a width of 0.6 mm, assuming an energy threshold at half the incident neutron energy. The corresponding widths for a DD detector are 0.17 and 0.03 mm, respectively. Finally, implications of the proton escape effect on the design of a fast-neutron tomography device for void distribution measurements at Uppsala University are presented. It is shown that the selection of DSE width strongly affects the instrument design when optimizing for image unsharpness. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Imaging with cold neutrons	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th World Conference on Neutron Radiography (WCNR-9)	OCT 03-08, 2010	N W Province, SOUTH AFRICA	S African Nucl Energy Corp (Necsa), Int Atom Energy Agcy (IAEA), S African Inst Non-Destruct Testing (SAINT), Volume Graphics GmbH		Neutron imaging; Beam properties; Micro-tomography; Energy selection; Bragg edges	RADIOGRAPHY; TOMOGRAPHY	Neutrons for imaging purposes are provided mainly from thermal beam lines at suitable facilities around the world. The access to cold neutrons is presently limited to very few places only. However, many challenging options for imaging with cold neutrons have been found out, given by the interaction behavior of the observed materials with neutrons in the cold energy range (3-10 angstrom). For absorbing materials, the interaction probability increases proportionally with the wavelength with the consequence of more contrast but less transmission with cold neutrons. Many materials are predominantly scattering neutrons, in particular most of crystalline structural materials. In these cases, cold neutrons play an important role by covering the energy range of the most important Bragg edges given by the lattice planes of the crystallites. This particular behavior can be used for at least two important aspects choosing the right energy of the initial beam enables to have a material more or less transparent, and a direct macroscopic visualization of the crystalline structure and its change in a manufacturing process. Since 2006, PSI operates its second beam line for neutron imaging, where cold neutrons are provided from a liquid deuterium cold source (operated at 25 K). It has been designed to cover the most current aspects in neutron imaging research with the help of high flexibility. This has been done with changeable inlet apertures, a turbine based velocity selector, two beam positions and variable detector systems, satisfying the demands of the individual investigation. The most important detection system was found to be a micro-tomography system that enables studies in the presently best spatial resolution. In this case, the high contrast from the sample interaction process and the high detection probability for the cold neutrons combines in an ideal combination for the best possible performance. Recently, it was found out that the energy selective studies might become a research field in its own sing the Bragg edge behavior and its modification to contribute to material research by the direct visualization of textures and the observation of stress and strain. This topic is still in the beginning but has some important relevance for the design of future beam lines for imaging at the pulsed spallation sources. Considering the neutrons to be waves, the cold energy range is important to push and to investigate phase effects in detail with high spatial resolution. Although a lot of studies have been done in this respect previously, there is enough space to study refraction at the edges, diffraction and total reflection with the best possible accuracy, and to figure out when and why neutrons interfere. Phase contrast methods like grating interference methods have to be implemented as a user option, which enables one to define their future application range. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Application of active and passive neutron non destructive assay methods to concrete radioactive waste drums	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Neutron measurement; Concrete matrix; Nuclear waste; MCNP	FISSILE ELEMENT SEPARATION	This paper deals with the application of non-destructive neutron measurement methods to control and characterize 200 I radioactive waste drums filled with a concrete matrix. Due to its composition, and particularly to hydrogen, concrete penalizes the use of such methods to quantify uranium (U) and plutonium (Pu) components, which are mainly responsible of the alpha-activity of the waste. The determination of the alpha activity is the main objective of neutron measurements, in view to verify acceptance criteria in surface storage. Calibration experiments of the Active Neutron Interrogation (ANI) method lead to Detection Limit Masses (DLM) of about 1 mg of (239)Pu(eff) in the total counting mode, and of about 10 mg of (239)Pu(eff) in the coincidence counting mode, in case of a homogeneous Pu source and measurement times between one and two hours. Monte Carlo calculation results show a very satisfactory agreement between experimental values and calculated ones. Results of the application of passive and active neutron methods to control two real drums are presented in the last part of the paper. They show a good agreement between measured data and values declared by the waste producers. The main difficulties that had to be overcome are the low neutron signal in passive and active coincidence counting modes due to concrete, the analysis of the passive neutron signal in presence of (244)Cm in the drum, which is a strong spontaneous fission neutron emitter, the variation of the active background with the concrete composition, and the analysis of the active prompt neutron signal due to the simultaneous presence of U and Pu in the drums.

Nuclear power technologies at the stage of sustainable nuclear power development	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Nuclear power technology; Potential energy; Nuclear fuel cycle; Lead-bismuth coolant	FAST-REACTORS	It is not simple to solve the problem of competitiveness of nuclear power technologies in evolutionary upgrading the conventional nuclear power plants (NPP) such as light water reactors (LWR), which requires high expenditure for safety. Moreover, the existing LWRs cannot provide nuclear power (NP) for a long time (hundreds of years) because the efficiency of use of natural uranium is low and closing the nuclear fuel cycle (NFC) for those reactors is not expedient. The highlighted problem can be solved in the way of use of innovative nuclear power technology in which natural uranium power potential is used effectively and the intrinsic conflict between economic and safety requirements has been essentially mitigated. The technology that is most available and practically demonstrated is the use of reactors SVBR-100-small power multi-purpose modular fast reactors (100 MWe) cooled by lead bismuth coolant (LBC). This technology has been mastered for nuclear submarines' reactors in Russia. High technical and economical parameters of the NPP based on RF SVBR-100 are determined from the fact that the potential energy stored in LBC per a volume unit is the lowest. The compactness of the reactor facility SVBR-100 that results from integral arrangement of the primary circuit equipment allows realizing renovation of power-units LWRs, the vessels' lifetime of which has been expired. So due to this fact, high economical efficiency can be obtained. The paper also validates the economical advantage of launching the uranium-fueled fast reactors with further changeover to the closed NFC with use of plutonium extracted from the own spent nuclear fuel in comparison with launching fast reactors directly with on uranium-plutonium fuel on the basis of plutonium extraction from spent nuclear fuel of LWRs.

J	Greenspan, E; Heidet, F				Greenspan, Ehud; Heidet, Florent			Energy sustainability and economic stability with Breed and Burn reactors	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Fast reactors; Breed and burn; Sustainability; Uranium utilization		The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the impact a successful development of Breed and Burn (B&B) fast reactors and their fuel reconditioning technologies could have on the uranium ore utilization, uranium enrichment capacity, nuclear waste and energy security. It is found that a successful development of B&B reactors will offer 40-folds increase in the uranium ore utilization versus that presently achieved. A successful development of a fuel reconditioning technology could increase the attainable uranium utilization to 100-folds its present value. The growth rate of the installed capacity of B&B reactors possible to achieve using the "spawning" mode of operation is estimated to be nearly 4% per year. The amount of natural uranium required for starting a fleet of B&B reactors that will reach an electricity generation capacity of 1000 GWe by the end of this century is estimated to be the equivalent of 10 years of supply to the presently operating commercial fleet of LWRs in the US (86 GWe). No natural uranium and no enrichment capacity will be required to support this fleet beyond the later part of this century. The energy value of the depleted uranium stockpiles ("waste") that will be accumulated in the US by that time is equivalent to, when used in the B&B reactors, up to 20 centuries of the total 2010 supply of electricity in the USA. It is therefore concluded that a successful development of B&B reactors and associated fuel reconditioning could provide a great measure of energy security, proliferation resistance and cost stability.

The ERANOS code is adopted to perform the neutronics and burn-up calculations, and the calculation scheme for axial fuel shuffling and coolant density coupling are set up. The parametric studies of a typical PWR with Th-U and U-Pu ((235)U instead of (239)Pu) conversions by burn-up and k(eff) calculations indicate that the breeding effects only exist in configurations with very low water content and the conversion or breeding becomes worse as the initial enrichment is increasing. The shuffling calculations for the 1-D SCWFR model described in this paper brought about some interesting results for a certain range of water content. The results indicate that the non-enriched fresh fuel is not possible for both Th-U and U-Pu conversions. As could be expected due to the eta-values of the main fissile isotopes (233)U and ((235)U, (239)Pu), respectively, the Th-U conversion needs a lower enrichment, and results in a slightly higher burn-up than the U-Pu conversion. The asymptotic power density distribution of the Th-U conversion is broader and lower than that of the U-Pu conversion. By reducing the water volume fraction, an increased burn-up can be achieved with correspondingly reduced fuel shuffling speed and reduced initial enrichment. Furthermore, the steady state calculations for the asymptotic state show that the Th-U conversion is superior to the U-Pu one concerning SCWFR safety aspects, where the absolute value of the Doppler constant is larger and the coolant feedback is negative for the Th-U conversion, while the coolant feedback is positive for the U-Pu one.

J	Srivastava, A; Jagannathan, V; Takaki, N				Srivastava, Argala; Jagannathan, V.; Takaki, Naoyuki			Reactor physics ideas for large scale utilization of thorium in gas cooled reactors	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Thorium breeder; HTTR; Physics design principles; Maximizing fissile conversion		The physics principles for maximizing the fertile to fissile conversion were used in developing reactor concepts for large scale utilization of thorium in thermal and fast reactors (Jagannathan & Pal, 2006; Jagannathan et al., 2008). It is recognized that these principles are very well suited for 'He' gas cooled reactors with graphite moderator since both helium gas coolant and the graphite moderator have low neutron absorption characteristics and thus gives better neutron economy. In this paper, these ideas are applied to the High Temperature Test Reactor (HTTR) core of Japan to assess its advantage over the present day gas cooled reactors. HTTR is helium cooled and graphite moderated system. Significant amount of thorium has been loaded in the HTTR core with some minimal changes in the existing core design. The modified design is called HTTR-M core. In the HTTR-M core, the fuel is changed from enriched UO(2) fuel to Pu in ThO(2) fuel. The locations of boron type burnable poison rods within each fuel assembly of HTTR are replaced by one cycle irradiated thoria rods. Also, the B(4)C type control assembly around the HTTR core is replaced by fresh seedless thorium assembly. The fertile thoria assembly are scattered uniformly in the HTTR-M core. The equilibrium core of HTTR-M shows very small burnup reactivity swing. The core excess reactivity is similar to 18 mk at BOC and reduces to 1 mk at 660 days. It is interesting to note that this small reactivity change is intrinsically achieved by the choice of seed and fertile dimensions and their contents without the use of burnable poison rods or mechanical control rods which are used in HTTR core. The burnup reactivity swing in the latter after using burnable poison is similar to 100 mk. The fissile seed inventory ratio (FIR) in a fuel cycle is 0.90 as compared with 0.717 of HTTR core. Since (233)U is a better fissile nuclide with highest value in thermal range, the above conversion ratio can be regarded as quite good. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kamei, T; Hakami, S				Kamei, Takashi; Hakami, Saeed			Evaluation of implementation of thorium fuel cycle with LWR and MSR	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Thorium fuel cycle; Molten-salt reactor (MSR); Implementation strategy; Transportation; Rare-earth		In order to construct a sustainable society, it is necessary to consider fairness beyond generations and between countries. It is expected that Asian countries continue growing their economy and will result consuming more energy. More CO(2) emission is not acceptable. Nuclear power has many advantages for reducing CO(2) emission. However, it still has concerns of nuclear proliferation, radioactive waste and safety. It is necessary to overcome these concerns if nuclear power is expanded to Asian countries. Thorium utilization as nuclear fuel will be an opening key of these difficulties because thorium produces less plutonium, less radioactive waste. Safety will also be enhanced. The use of molten-salt reactor (MSR) triggered by plutonium supply from ordinary light water reactor (LWR) with uranium fuel will allow implementation of thorium fuel cycle with electricity capacity of about 446 GWe around at 2050. The other important sector in a view of sustainability is transportation. Transportation is essential for economy growth. Therefore it is inevitable to reduce CO(2) emission from transportation sector. Electric vehicle (EV) will be used as a major mobility instead of gasoline engine cars. Rare-earth materials such as neodymium and dysprosium are necessary for producing EV. These materials are expected to be mined from Asian countries. It is often obtained with thorium as by-product. Thorium has not been used as nuclear fuel because it is not good for nuclear weapon and it does not have fissionable isotopes. Recent global trend of nuclear disarmament and accumulation of plutonium from uranium fuel cycle can support starting the use of thorium. Thorium utilization will help both to provide clean energy and to produce rare-earth for clean vehicle. These will create new industries in developing Asian countries. An international collaborative framework can be established by supplying resource from developing countries and supplying technology from developed countries. "THE Bank (THorium Energy Bank)" is proposed here as one part of such a framework. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In Europe safety investigations are currently under way e.g. in the collaborative CP-ESFR project of the EU. Both on the prevention and mitigation side significant efforts are invested to fulfill the high safety goals. One route of assurance concentrates on the mitigation or even elimination of specific severe accident routes leading to core disruption and recriticalities. The accident phase with larger disrupted and molten fuel regions is coined the transition phase. A competition between fuel losses and in-pool material motion exists deciding over recriticalities and energetics potentials in this phase. To get a control of the transition phase recriticalities and energetics, ideas have been developed to install dedicated means in the core that enhance and guarantee a sufficient and timely fuel discharge - a controlled material relocation (CMR). Several proposals are under way to accomplish this CMR and especially in Japan significant theoretical and experimental work has been performed. In Europe the path to develop CMR measures was driven in the past by the development of the CAPRA reactors with a high Pu enrichment. In the current paper the status of analyses is described and some new concepts are discussed. The CMR measures are discussed along two accident scenarios, the unprotected loss of flow (ULOF) and the instantaneous blockage accident (TIB). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Since Pb-208 capture and inelastic-scattering cross sections are significantly smaller in a wide energy range and are increasing more rapidly in the high energy range than other Pb isotopes of natural lead, the proposed CANDLE will have a better neutron utilization and a better coolant reactivity feedback. As consequence the core dimensions (both height and radius) and the associated pressure drop can be reduced, which leads to an additional advantage for reactor construction, operation and transportation. Moreover, it was investigated as well that the power shape can be flattened by loading the thorium fuel in the inner core zone, which leads to a reduced radial peaking factor and a higher burn-up.

As a result of comparative study of uranium and lead-bismuth (PbBi) targets in the bare case without blanket surrounding, it was found that uranium target had better neutron generation performance, but limited by the geometrical size due to high neutron absorption in (238)U. In ADS for MA transmutation, uranium used as target instead of PbBi also absorbs neutrons passing the target area. More realistic concept of pin type uranium spallation target cooled by liquid PbBi was considered aiming at enhancing spallation target performance in terms of neutron generation efficiency and operation temperature. The uranium pin target design had nothing better effects on neutron balance of such system than a conventional PbBi target in ADS and it was concluded that uranium target was not suitable for the full-scale ADS.

The ion concentration ratios of Sr(II), Ce(III), and U(VI) in solutions before and after nanofluidic separation treatments were measured using ICP analysis. The results showed that the mass flow rates of Sr(II), Ce(III), and U(VI) ions in nanofluidic channels were quite different. The flow rates of Ce(III) and U(VI) ions in solutions through 3000 nm-sized nanochannnels were much smaller than those of Sr(II), and increased gradually with decreasing space sizes until 300 nm. The decontamination factors of Sr(II) and Ce(III) against U(VI) were determined as 10.6 and 12.5 in 3000 nm-sized channels and 1.3 and 1.7 in 300 nm-sized channels, respectively. The ion concentration ratios of Ce(III) and U(VI) in acid solutions were also examined in 300 nm-sized channels, and the mass flow rates of Ce(III) and U(VI) were found to decrease and increase with increasing acid concentrations, respectively. Furthermore, the nanofluidic device made it possible to mutually separate U(IV) and U(VI) ions in acid solutions by flowing into nanofluidic channels. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This concept involves a more valuable process for LWR spent-fuel reprocessing than the conventional process and improved proliferation resistance. We have been developing a new technology, the Toshiba Hybrid Reprocessing Process, based on solvent extraction and pyro-chemical electrolysis, for spent fuel reprocessing for the transition period from LWRs to FRs. The Toshiba Hybrid Reprocessing Process combines the solvent extraction process of the LWR spent fuel in nitric acid with the recovery of high-purity uranium (U) and the pyro-chemical process in molten salts for recovery of impure plutonium with minor actinides (Pu + MA). High-purity U is used for LWR fuel, and impure Pu + MA is used for metallic FR fuel. Valence control by the electrolysis and solvent extraction tests using LWR spent fuel and oxalate precipitation tests were carried out to confirm the feasibility of the Toshiba Hybrid Reprocessing Process. A consecutive processing equipment for the solvent extraction process and a bench-scale apparatus for the pyro-chemical process were manufactured. The consecutive processing equipment consists of a flow type electrolytic cell and a centrifugal extractor. The test revealed that U of 99.99% of purity was recovered. The bench-scale apparatus consists of a reactor for oxalate precipitation, a solid-liquid separator in which nitric acid with fission products and precipitation are separated, and a drying equipment in which the precipitation is dry. Precipitation test with neodymium (Nd) which is simulated as Pu + MA in nitric acid was carried out. It was confirmed that precipitation ratio of Nd was more than 99.9% and that moisture ratio of the precipitation was less than 10%. The results suggested that U recovery of LWR spent fuel was 99.99% with the consecutive processing equipment and Pu + MA recovery was more than 99.9% with the bench-scale apparatus. The Toshiba Hybrid Reprocessing Process could recover high-purity U used for LWR fuel, and impure Pu + MA used for metallic FR fuel. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

With increasing the concentration of HNO(3) from 0.01 to 3.0 mol/dm(3) (M), distribution ratio decreased. This suggests that uranyl ions are extracted by ion exchange with a cation component of BMINfO, i.e. BMI(+). The amount of BMI+ transferred to aqueous phase accompanied by extraction of U(VI) was evaluated with (1)H NMR measurement. Plots of the amount of U(VI) extracted versus the amount of BMI+ transferred from BMINfO phase to the aqueous phase indicated linear relationship. The slope of the line was about 1.0 and 0.63 in the extraction system of U(VI) performed in 0.1 and 1.0 M HNO(3), respectively. This result means that two types of extraction mechanisms exist depending on the concentration of HNO(3). One is the ion exchange mechanism. Another is the ion-pair extraction mechanism.

The present paper summarizes analysis of the individual Am and U samples irradiation in Joyo to re-evaluate the results of Pu isotopes in the measure of proliferation resistance, and to combine the results for the prediction of DU-Am irradiation especially in the production of Pu isotopes. By the prediction of DU-Am oxide fuel in fast reactor environment with detail fuel irradiation analysis, it was confirmed that neutron moderation and fuel size affects the produced Pu isotope and its vector due to the very high sensitivity of (238)U resonance capture reaction, the larger diameter fuel is more preferable in the case of moderated neutron spectrum environment for denaturing Pu in fast reactor blanket. Finally proliferation resistance of all the Pu produced in U, Am sample irradiation and DU-Am fuel irradiation prediction were evaluated based on decay heat and spontaneous fission neutron rate, and it was confirmed (241)Am produces un-attractive Pu to abuse from the beginning to the end of irradiation, and more than 2% of (241)Am doping is required to enhance the proliferation resistance of Pu to MOX grade and Kessler's proposal in moderated neutron spectrum environment in fast reactor.

The DH and SFN compositions increase significantly with increasing diluted fraction of even mass Plutonium, except for DH of Pu-242.1t shows that diluted fraction of Pu-238 contributes most significantly to the DH ad SFN compositions at certain diluted fractions. Only diluted fraction of Pu-238 can reach a DH composition level of MOX fuel for small diluted fraction and an SFN level of MOX fuel can be reached by all diluted fractions of even mass Plutonium. It requires more than 80% of diluted Pu-238 fraction to achieve a low material attractiveness based on FOM1 formula and there is no available diluted fraction for Pu-240 and Pu-242 for reaching it. It is easier to reach a low material attractiveness by using FOM2 than that of FOM1 caused by additional contribution of the SFN component, as well as ATTR, which also considers both DH and SFN components. The material attractiveness of FOM2 and ATTR as a function of diluted even mass Plutonium fractions are shown in similar trend, which requires some diluted fraction depending on even mass Plutonium for achieving low material attractiveness of FOM 2 and practically unusable level of ATM.

J	Meiliza, Y; Ohki, S; Okubo, T				Meiliza, Yoshitalia; Ohki, Shigeo; Okubo, Tsutomu			Effect of minor actinides doping on plutonium produced in large-scale FBR blanket	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Proliferation resistance; Plutonium; Minor actinides; Fast reactor; Blanket		The present study focuses on the effect of minor actinides (MAs) addition into the FBR blanket as ways of increasing fraction of even-mass-number plutonium isotopes, especially (238)Pu, aiming at enhancing the proliferation resistance of plutonium produced in the blanket. The MA loading potential to enhance the proliferation resistance of plutonium is investigated, with considering actual design constraints on the fuel decay heat from the fuel handling and fabrication points of view, as MAs considerably generate decay heat. It reveals that depending on doping quantity of MAs, it is possible to denature produced plutonium by MA transmutation. MA addition in the blanket gives a significant increment in (238)Pu fraction of generated plutonium but less effect on other even-mass-number plutonium isotopes. However, it is important that MA compositions should be adequately controlled to satisfy both the proliferation resistance requirements and the decay heat constraints for fuel handling.

Decontamination of spent molten salt waste is also the problem to be solved for establishment of pyrochemical reprocessing. The decontamination method of spent molten salt waste with recovery of minor actinides has been proposed. Our proposed process is based on the hydrometallurgical process. This process consists of the following processes. First, the spent molten salt waste is dissolved in aqueous solution. Next, the minor actinides are recovered by chromatographic techniques using the pyridine resin in the methanolic hydrochloric acid solution. In the last process, the spent molten salt waste is decontaminated by the cation-exchange chromatography. In the present paper, the adsorption behavior of minor actinides, rare earth elements, alkaline earth elements, and alkali metal elements on pyridine resin is reported. The demonstration experiment of the recovery of the minor actinides from simulant spent molten salt waste is also reported. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kawakami, F; Tokiwai, M; Fujii, Y				Kawakami, Fumiaki; Tokiwai, Moriyasu; Fujii, Yasuhiko			Plant designing of ion exchange chemical uranium enrichment and its non-proliferation aspects	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Uranium; Enrichment; Ion exchange; Non-proliferation; Enrichment plant; Fission criticality	SEPARATION	The chemical uranium enrichment using ion exchanger had been developed mainly in Japan, but now only the academic studies have been continued at Tokyo Tech. For the purpose of revaluation as the alternative production process of the low enriched uranium for nuclear power plants, the plant design and the non-proliferation aspects of redox ion exchange chemical uranium enrichment (Redox Ion Exchange Method) were studied. The conceptual design of a commercial enrichment plant with a scale of 1400 tSWU/Y was newly performed based on data reported. It is composed of seven enrichment units with two enrichment columns with an inner diameter of 6.5 m and a height of 11 m and redox systems. It is evaluated as having the site area of 97,200 m(2) including the vacancy to double the production with subsidiary sections of pre-treatment and post-treatment of uranium or the like, a construction cost is 218 billion Japanese yen(JPY), and a cost per enrichment work is 18,000 JPY/kgSWU. As for the nuclear proliferation resistance of this process, it is suggested that the production of highly enriched uranium for weapon use is difficult from the view point of nuclear fission criticality and the lengthy equilibrium time mentioned as following. It is difficult to operate the enrichment plant for the production of highly enriched uranium of 50 wt% of (235)U or higher, because the effective neutron multiplication factor (k(eff)) in the enrichment columns becomes 1 or above depending on the enrichment conditions. And the required time for the production of highly enriched uranium of 90 wt% of (235)U is estimated 10 thousands days or more, this means substantially impossible to get highly enriched uranium under the safeguard of IAEA by the Redox Ion Exchange Method. The Redox Ion Exchange Method is suggested to be a promising candidate for an alternative enrichment process to obtain low enriched uranium in the range 3-5 wt% (235)U for nuclear power plant in the world. Furthermore, for the future prospective fuel cycle without UF(6), new front-end system coupled with uranium from seawater and chemical enrichment is proposed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The basic concept of the Adv.-ORIENT Cycle uses a three-pronged approach, separation, transmutation and utilization of nuclides and elements, based on the FBR fuel cycle. Fundamental research studies done in Adv.-OEIENT Cycle [Phase-1: 2006-2010] have led to the following findings. 1. Cs and Sr separation and its utilization: Silica gel loaded with ammonium molybdophosphate (AMP) and hybrid organic microcapsules with crown ether D18C6 were investigated to chromatographically separate Cs and Sr, respectively. In particular, uptake experiments of Cs from solution simulating the spent fuel solution obtained were carried out by a batch method, and the uptake rates achieved were more than 90%. 2. Minor actinide (MA)/lanthanide/fission product (FP) separation: A tertiary pyridine type resin (TPR) can be used to recover Am, Cm and lantanide elements with a high separation factor by a chromatographic method from spent fuel solution. The TPR can be used with hydrochloric acid (HCl) as well as nitric acid (HNO(3)). 3. Ru, Ph, Pd and Tc separation: A catalytic electrolytic extraction (CEE) method can effectively separate Ru, Ph, Pd and Tc. High recovery ratios of Ru, Rh, Pd, Tc, Se, etc. were achieved using HCl solutions. Rh co-deposition significantly accelerated reduction of Ru, Tc and Re using HNO(3) solutions. 4. Ru, Ph, Pd and Tc utilization: Based on the mixed deposit obtained from the CEE experiments, Ru/Rh/Pd/Tc(Re)-Pt electrodes provided the highest catalytic reactivity in the electrolytic production of hydrogen in an alkali solution. 5. Basic engineering research: Results of corrosion experiments showed that Hastelloy-B and Ta had a good anti-corrosive property in a wide range of HCl concentrations. The basic thermo-chemical stability of TPR and tri-butyl phosphorous (TBP, as a reference) was also experimentally studied, and the process safety conditions to be specified for practical use of TPR could be identified.

The influence of metal ions, which simulate metallic elements in nuclear spent fuels, and that of the composition of the methanol-nitric acid solution, on the thermal hazards of the mixture of TPR and the methanol-nitric acid solution has been estimated through thermal analysis and gram-scale heating experiments. Simulated high level liquid waste nitric acid solutions (SHLLW) were prepared through the addition of 28 reagents. It is reasonable to consider that metal ions have little influence on the thermal stability of the TPR-methanol-nitric acid system. However, it is likely that the possibility of thermal explosion is increased because the heat of the reaction of the TPR-methanol-SHLLW system with its precipitates is largest in all samples. It is reasonable to assume that the vigorous reactions of the TPR-methanol-nitric acid or SHLLW system would occur minimally in a closed and reflux condition even if this system were heated, because the exothermic reaction of the TPR-methanol-nitric acid or SHLLW system would be prevented by the latent heat of the evaporation of methanol-nitric acid solution.

In the molten state, coordination number of thorium (N(i)) and inter ionic distances between thorium and fluorine in the first neighbor (r(i)) are nearly constant in all mixtures. However the fluctuation factors (Debye-Waller factor (sigma(2)) and C(3) cumulant) increase until xCaF(2) = 0.17 and decrease by addition of excess CaF(2). It means that the local structure around Th(4+) is disordered until xCaF(2) = 0.17 and stabilized over xCaF(2) = 0.17. The variation of fluctuation factors is related to the number density of F(-) in ThF(4) mixtures and the stability of local structure around Th(4+) increases with decreasing the number density of F- in ThF(4) mixtures. This tendency is common to those in the ZrF(4) and YF(3) mixtures. However, in the case of YF(3) mixtures, the local structure around Y(3+) becomes disordered until xCaF(2) = 0.40 and it becomes stabilized by addition of excess CaF(2). The difference between ThF(4) mixtures and YF(3) mixtures is related to the difference of Coulumbic interaction between Th(4+)-F(-) and Y(3+)-F(-). Therefore, the variation of local structure around cation is related to not only number density of F(-) in molten salts but also the Coulumbic interaction between cation and anion.

CHEMICAL ABSORBENT FOR CATCHING HALOGEN-CONTAINING GASES DISCHARGED FROM ISOTOPE SEPARATION PLANTS	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The results of industrial tests of a cascade of chemical absorbents for catching spent halogen-containing processes gases during discharge into the atmosphere are discussed. It is noted that the volume of the discharged gases decreases as a result of CO(2) absorption. The HF and Cl(2) content in passing gas can serve as a criterion for the completion of each catching step; Cl(2) detection after the last step is a service life criterion for all chemical absorbents of a facility without exception. The average catching efficiency is 99.7 and 98.5% with respect to fluorine-and chlorine-containing components, respectively. An approximate calculation of the near-ground concentration of HF and Cl(2) is performed. The gases discharged by the isotope separation plant at the Siberian Chemical Combine were purified at the level of the maximum admissible concentration for the working zone and not at the level of the technical norm established individually for each industrial enterprise. Equipping nuclear fuel cycle enterprises with such systems will make it possible to decrease environmental contamination considerably.	[Gromov, O. B.; Medvedev, M. V.; Nikonov, V. I.; Seredenko, V.

The approach is based on the difference in the stability of complexes of organic ions with metals. Substituting iron(III) for cobalt results in almost complete liberation of Co(2+) from the complex. Coprecipitation of Co(2+) with Fe(3+) in the form of oxohydroxides results in the liberation of Co(2+) from solution into the solid phase. An excess of Fe(3+) cations with respect to Co(2+) and an increase of acidity, processing temperature, and aging time of the solutions at the preliminary stage results in complete liberation of cobalt from the solution for pH >= 12.

ESR dosimetry study for the residents of Kazakhstan exposed to radioactive fallout on 24, August 1956	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article						ESR dosimetry; Tooth enamel; Semipalatinsk nuclear test site; Retrospective dosimetry	TOOTH ENAMEL DOSIMETRY; NUCLEAR TEST-SITE; EPR DOSIMETRY; SEMIPALATINSK REGION; DOSE RECONSTRUCTION; OPTIMIZATION; POPULATION; VICINITY; PARAMETERS; TEETH	The method of electron spin resonance (ESR) dosimetry has been applied to human tooth enamel in order to obtain individual absorbed doses from the population of settlements within the vicinity of the central axis of the radioactive fallout trace from the contaminating nuclear surface test of 24. August 1956. Most of the settlements (Glubokoe, Tavriya, and Gagarino) are located near Ust-Kamenogorsk city, in Kazakhstan (about 400 km to the east from the epicenter of the explosion at the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site (SNTS)). It was found that the excess doses obtained after the subtraction of natural background radiation ranged up to about 120 mGy for the residents of Ust-Kamenogorsk city, whose tooth enamel was formed before 1956. For the residents of Gagarino, excess doses do not exceed 47 mGy for all ages. For the residents of Tavriya, the maximum of excess dose was determined as 54 mGy and for the residents of Glubokoe, the maximum excess dose was about 83 mGy. For the population of the Shemonaikha settlements (about 70 km from the centerline of the radioactive fallout trace) the highest excess dose is 110 mGy. Also for this study, Znamenka village (about 130 km from the epicenter) was included. The Kokpekty settlement was chosen as a control and not subjected to any radioactive contamination and is located 400 km to the Southeast from SNTS.

Harmonization of dosimetric information obtained by different EPR methods: Experience of the Techa river study	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article						Tooth enamel; Electron paramagnetic resonance; Retrospective dosimetry; Statistical analysis; Harmonization	TOOTH ENAMEL DOSIMETRY; SEMIPALATINSK REGION; HUMAN TEETH; PART 1; SPECTRUM	Between 1949 and 1956 the Techa River (Southern Urals, Russia) was contaminated as a result of releases of radioactive waste by the Mayak Production Association. EPR dosimetry with tooth enamel has been used to estimate the external exposure of Techa riverside residents over the last 17 years. The database "Tooth" of the Urals Research Center for Radiation Medicine (URCRM) has accumulated about 1000 EPR measurements of tooth enamel from the rural population of the Urals region. The teeth were investigated by laboratories of Russia, USA, Germany and Italy. Most of the enamel samples were measured several times in different laboratories. Each laboratory used different equipment and its own methods for sample preparation and EPR spectra analysis. Even measurements performed at the same laboratory over 10-15 years may not be assumed as uniform: methods change with time, and equipment is subject to aging. These two factors influenced EPR performance. The purpose of this study is, therefore, the harmonization of EPR data accumulated during long-term dosimetric investigations in the Southern Urals for further pooled analysis. The results will be used for external dose evaluation in the Techa River region. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Volchkova, A.; Shishkina, E. A.; Timofeev, Yu.; Degteva, M.

The Equivalent Doses (D-e) of (1.3 +/- 0.2)kGy, (800 +/- 100)Gy and (140 +/- 20)Gy were found and the software ROSY ESR dating was employed to convert D-e in age, using isotope concentrations determined by neutron activation analysis (NM) and other information, resulting in (500 +/- 100)ka, (320 +/- 50) and (90 +/- 10)ka considering the Combination Uptake (CU) model for Uranium uptake, set as an Early Uptake (EU) for dentine and Linear Uptake (LU) for enamel. There are scarce reports about Pleistocene Megafauna in this area. This paper presents the first dating of megafauna tooth and this study could contribute to improve the knowledge about the paleoclimate and paleoenvironment of this region and prompt more investigations in this area.

Influence of thermal treatment on beryllium/carbon formation and fuel retention	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							CARBON; LAYERS	Since the operation conditions for the nuclear fuel removal in a fusion power plant like ITER involves wall baking at high temperatures of the plasma facing components - i.e. 515 K for the first wall and 623 K for the divertor area - it is important to know how this thermal treatment procedures will affect the materials' properties. It was observed that by heating at 623 K. the carbon from the graphite substrate diffuses into the deposited beryllium film forming a mixed layer of Be, BeO and Be2C at the interface, while the oxygen present at the Be-C interface diffuses to the surface of the film. Comparing the results obtained by Nuclear Reaction Analysis it was observed that the deuterium implanted after annealing was retained in deeper layers in the case of thermally treated samples due to the structural changes induced in the films by the Be/C mixed layer formation and the effects of the oxygen diffusion into the thermal treated films.

A new generation of ISOL nanostructured and submicrometric porous materials have been developed, exhibiting enhanced release of exotic isotopes, compared to previously used conventional micrometric materials. A programme was developed at PSI within the framework sof the Design Study of EURISOL, the next generation European ISOL-type facility to study aging under irradiation on porous ceramic pellets and dense thin metal foils at high temperatures. Ceramic oxides and carbide samples underwent proton damage with fluence up to 3.0 x 10(20) and 1.3 x 10(21) cm(-2) respectively. The post-irradiation examination on Al2O3, Y2O3 and SiC - C nanotube composite matrices show a proton-induced densification region in which a moderate grain growth occurred. The microstructural evolution effects were associated to the combination of radiation-enhanced diffusion and thermal diffusion. The irradiated Al2O3 shows higher sintering rates than in similar non-irradiation isothermal conditions, in particular at the lowest irradiation temperature, subjected to a proton fluence inferior to 1.1 x 10(15) cm(-2). The apparent activation energy for its sintering controlling mechanism was found to be between 44 and 88 kJ mol(-1). However, despite the enhanced sintering, shrinkage and increased grain growth, the selected nanostructured and submicrometric TARPIPE materials did not display an average grain diameter above 2 mu m, which confirms that these materials are suited as production targets for present and next generation ISOL facilities.

Thermal diffusivity and conductivity of thorium-plutonium mixed oxides	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							SOLID-SOLUTIONS; DIOXIDE; TEMPERATURE; FUELS; THO2; MODEL; UO2; (U	The thermal diffusivity of (Th,Pu)O-2 (with 3,8 and 30 wt.% PuO2) mixed oxides and of the single oxides PuO2 and ThO2 was measured using the laser flash technique. In several samples, a further degradation in the thermal diffusivity due to auto-irradiation damage was noted, and a recovery could be achieved by thermal treatment. The ThO2 and (Th,Pu)O-2 samples with 3 and 8 wt.% PuO2 were found to be semitransparent and had to be coated with C for the thermal diffusivity measurement. The experimental thermal conductivity of the fuels was calculated and analysed. The introduction of PuO2 in the ThO2 was found to have an effect similar to that observed in (U,Pu)O-2 mixed oxides: small decrease in the range 3-8 wt.% PuO2 and higher decrease at 30 wt.% PuO2 content. Using the classical phonon transport model in crystal structures, a new correlation for the thermal conductivity of (Th,Pu)O-2 mixed oxides is proposed and is compared to the results of another correlation built after the Klemens-Callaway theory.

Plutonium-uranium mixed oxide characterization by coupling micro-X-ray diffraction and absorption investigations	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							LOCAL-STRUCTURE; SOLID-SOLUTIONS; DIOXIDE; FUEL; SPECTROSCOPY; PUO2+X; DIFFUSION; BEHAVIOR; UO2; XAS	Plutonium-uranium mixed oxide (MOX) fuels are currently used in nuclear reactors. The potential differences of metal redox state and microstructural developments of the matrix before and after irradiation are commonly analysed by electron probe microanalysis. In this work the structure and next-neighbor atomic environments of Pu and U oxide features within unirradiated homogeneous MOX and irradiated (60 MW d kg(-1)) MOX samples was analysed by micro-X-ray fluorescence (mu-XRF), micro-X-ray diffraction (mu-XRD) and micro-X-ray absorption fine structure (mu-XAFS) spectroscopy. The grain properties, chemical bonding, valences and stoichiometry of Pu and U are determined from the experimental data gained for the unirradiated as well as for irradiated fuel material examined in the center of the fuel as well as in its peripheral zone (rim). The formation of sub-grains is observed as well as their development from the center to the rim (polygonization). In the irradiated sample Pu remains tetravalent (>95%) and no (<5%) Pu(V) or Pu(VI) can be detected while the fuel could undergo slight oxidation in the rim zone. Any slight potential plutonium oxidation is buffered by the uranium dioxide matrix while locally fuel cladding interaction could also affect the redox of the fuel. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Fission gases and helium gas behavior in irradiated mixed oxide fuel pin	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							FBR MOX FUEL; HIGH BURNUP; UO2 FUEL; RELEASE	Behavior of helium and fission gases in irradiated mixed oxide (MOX) fuels was investigated by pin puncture and heating tests by quantitatively measuring amounts of helium and fission gases in a fuel pin irradiated in JOYO to similar to 50 MW d kg(-1) as a whole pin average burnup. While the fission gas releases were 47% and 48% for Kr and Xe respectively, all helium generated during irradiation was released (similar to 100%), and the helium released during the heating test was derived from alpha-decay after irradiation. The release profile during the heating test indicated that helium gas release onset temperature was below 1173 K at an isothermal condition, but during irradiation, the helium release behavior could be understood by taking its high diffusion coefficient into consideration.

Short-term irradiation behavior of low-density americium-doped uranium-plutonium mixed oxide fuels irradiated in a fast reactor	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							REDISTRIBUTION; TRANSMUTATION; NEPTUNIUM	A short-term irradiation test (B14) was conducted using the experimental fast reactor Joyo. The objective of the test was to investigate the early thermal behavior of americium-doped uranium-plutonium mixed oxide (Am-MOX) fuels such as fuel restructuring and redistribution of actinides. Four fuel pins which contained 2.4 wt.% americium-doped uranium-plutonium mixed oxide (Am, Pu, U)O(2-x) fuels were supplied for testing. Pellet-cladding gap width and oxygen-to-metal (O/M) molar ratio of oxide fuels were determined as experimental parameters. The respective amounts of plutonium and americium in the fuel pellets were 31 and 2.4 wt.%. The fuel pins were irradiated at the maximum linear heating rate of similar to 470 W cm(-1) in the B14 test. After the irradiation, post-irradiation examinations were conducted. The influences of both pellet-cladding gap width and O/M molar ratio on the fuel restructuring were confirmed, and no fuel melting was observed. Americium and plutonium were similarly redistributed depending on the O/M molar ratio. In the fuel specimen of the highest O/M molar ratio, the difference in contents between americium and plutonium around the central void was significant. From the examination results, the margins to the criteria in the thermal design of the fuel pin would be suitable under the expected operating conditions of a conventional fast breeder reactor.

The melting behaviour of plutonium dioxide: A laser-heating study	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							HYPERSTOICHIOMETRIC URANIUM-DIOXIDE; INTERNATIONAL TEMPERATURE SCALE; THERMOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES; PHASE DIAGRAM; UO2-PUO2 SYSTEM; LIQUIDUS; SOLIDUS; UO2	In this work the melting behaviour of plutonium dioxide has been studied for the first time via laser heating. With this method, the short experiment duration combined with minimal contact between sample and containment minimized undesired side effects, such as sample reduction, vaporisation or reaction with the holder. The sample temperature was measured by fast pyrometry, and inflections in the recorded thermograms revealed the liquid-to-solid transition. This latter was also detected via a method based on the reflectance study of a low-power laser beam reflected by the sample surface. Multi-channel spectro-pyrometry was used to investigate, in parallel, the normal spectral emittance of the samples in the wavelength range between 550 and 920 nm at the investigated temperature. The present experimental melting temperature of (3017 +/- 28) K is much higher than the values obtained in the past by traditional heating techniques. It is suggested that, in contrast to the present data, previous results were affected by extensive reaction of the plutonium dioxide samples with the containment and/or changes in the O/Pu ratio at high temperature.

Structural changes in thin films of yttria-stabilized zirconia irradiated with uranium ions in the electronic stopping regime	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							PULSED-LASER DEPOSITION; INERT MATRIX FUEL; SWIFT HEAVY-IONS; RAMAN-SPECTRA; CARBON-FILMS; TEMPERATURE; DIFFRACTION; POLYMORPHS; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEM	Poly-crystalline, partially monoclinic, yttria partially stabilized zirconia (Y-PSZ) was deposited on a 25 nm thick Au-covered (1 0 0) Si substrate by means of UV pulsed laser ablation. The 400 nm thick films were irradiated with single ionized swift heavy uranium ((238)U) ions of about 1300 MeV, applying ion fluences from 5 to 20 x 10(11) cm(-2). The samples were characterized before and after irradiation using X-ray diffraction (XRD), micro-Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). With increasing ion fluence there is a progressive change from monoclinic to tetragonal/cubic polymorphs. TEM of selected samples indicates formation of Au islands on the Si substrate and the development of a defective microstructure under irradiation. The nature, distribution and aggregation of ion-beam induced defects are mainly associated with oxygen migration to the film surface and are probably responsible for the structure changes under irradiation.

Predicting thermo-mechanical behaviour of high minor actinide content composite oxide fuel in a dedicated transmutation facility	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							THERMOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES; THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY	The European Facility for Industrial Transmutation (EFIT) of the minor actinides (MA), from LWR spent fuel is being developed in the integrated project EUROTRANS within the 6th Framework Program of EURATOM. Two composite uranium-free fuel systems, containing a large fraction of MA, are proposed as the main candidates: a CERCER with magnesia matrix hosting (Pu,MA)O(2-x) particles, and a CERMET with metallic molybdenum matrix. The long-term thermal and mechanical behaviour of the fuel under the expected EFIT operating conditions is one of the critical issues in the core design. To make a reliable prediction of long-term thermo-mechanical behaviour of the hottest fuel rods in the lead-cooled version of EFIT with thermal power of 400 MW, different fuel performance codes have been used.

Optimisation of composite metallic fuel for minor actinide transmutation in an accelerator-driven system	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article								A potential option for neutralization of minor actinides (MA) accumulated in spent nuclear fuel of light water reactors (LWRs) is their transmutation in dedicated accelerator-driven systems (ADS). A promising fuel candidate dedicated to MA transmutation is a CERMET composite with Mo metal matrix and (Pu, Np, Am, Cm)O(2-x) fuel particles. Results of optimisation studies of the CERMET fuel targeting to increasing the MA transmutation efficiency of the EFIT (European Facility for Industrial Transmutation) core are presented. In the adopted strategy of MA burning the plutonium (Pu) balance of the core is minimized, allowing a reduction in the reactivity swing and the peak power form-factor deviation and an extension of the cycle duration. The MA/Pu ratio is used as a variable for the fuel optimisation studies. The efficiency of MA transmutation is close to the foreseen theoretical value of 42 kg TW(-1) h(-1) when level of Pu in the actinide mixture is about 40 wt.%. The obtained results are compared with the reference case of the EFIT core loaded with the composite CERCER fuel, where fuel particles are incorporated in a ceramic magnesia matrix. The results of this study offer additional information for the EFIT fuel selection. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ab initio modeling of oxygen impurity atom incorporation into uranium mononitride surface and sub-surface vacancies	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; ADVANCED NUCLEAR-FUELS; WAVE BASIS-SET; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; 1ST-PRINCIPLES; NITRIDE; UN; TRANSITION; OXIDATION	The incorporation of oxygen atoms has been simulated into either nitrogen or uranium vacancy at the UN(0 0 1) surface, sub-surface or central layers. For calculations on the corresponding slab models both the relativistic pseudopotentials and the method of projector augmented-waves (PAW) as implemented in the VASP computer code have been used. The energies of O atom incorporation and solution within the defective UN surface have been calculated and discussed. For different configurations of oxygen ions at vacancies within the UN(0 0 1) slab, the calculated density of states and electronic charge re-distribution was analyzed. Considerable energetic preference of O atom incorporation into the N-vacancy as compared to U-vacancy indicates that the observed oxidation of UN is determined mainly by the interaction of oxygen atoms with the surface and sub-surface N-vacancies resulting in their capture by the vacancies and formation of O-U bonds with the nearest uranium atoms.

Interdiffusion behaviors in doped molybdenum uranium and aluminum or aluminum silicon dispersion fuels: Effects of the microstructure	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							AL A356 ALLOY; MO; SI; SYSTEM	Si addition to Al is considered as a promising route to reduce (U,Mo)-Al interaction kinetics, due to its accumulation in the interaction layer, yielding the formation of silicide phases. The (U,Mo) alloy microstructure, and especially its homogenization state, could play a role on this accumulation process. The addition of a third element in gamma(U,Mo) could also influence diffusion mechanisms of Al and Si. These two parameters were studied by means of diffusion couple experiments by joining gamma U based alloys with Al and (Al,Si) alloy. Chemical elements X added into gamma(U,Mo) were thoroughly chosen on the following criteria: (i) the potential solubility of the alloying element into the gamma(U,Mo) matrix, (ii) its capability to form the ternary aluminides based on the CeCr(2)Al(20) and Ho(6)Mo(4)Al(43) - types, and (iii) the feasibility to control the microstructure of the alloys. On this basis, a test matrix is defined. It concerns gamma(U80,Mo15,X5) alloys (in at.%) with X = Y, Cu, Zr, Ti or Cr. These alloys were homogenized and coupled with Al or (Al,Si) alloy. Results evidenced, first, the importance of the state of homogenization of the gamma(U,Mo) binary alloy on interaction processes with (Al,Si) alloy, and the benefit on the diffusion of Si through the interaction layer, as observed on the elementary concentration profiles, when the third element X has some solubility into gamma(U,Mo) alloy.

Radionuclide release from research reactor spent fuel	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							CORROSION; HYDROGEN; BRINE	Numerous investigations with respect to LWR fuel under non oxidizing repository relevant conditions were performed. The results obtained indicate slow corrosion rates for the UO(2) fuel matrix. Special fuel-types (mostly dispersed fuels, high enriched in (235)U, cladded with aluminium) are used in German research reactors, whereas in German nuclear power plants, UO(2)-fuel (LWR fuel, enrichment in (235)U up to 5%, zircaloy as cladding) is used. Irradiated research reactor fuels contribute less than 1% to the total waste volume. In Germany, the state is responsible for fuel operation and for fuel back-end options. The institute for energy research (IEF-6) at the Research Center Jillich performs investigation with irradiated research reactor spent fuels under repository relevant conditions. In the study, the corrosion of research reactor spent fuel has been investigated in MgCl(2)-rich salt brine and the radionuclide release fractions have been determined. Leaching experiments in brine with two different research reactor fuel-types were performed in a hot cell facility in order to determine the corrosion behaviour and the radionuclide release fractions. The corrosion of two dispersed research reactor fuel-types (UAl(x)-Al and U(3)Si(2)-Al) was studied in 400 mL MgCl(2)-rich salt brine in the presence of Fe(2+) under static and initially anoxic conditions. Within these experimental parameters, both fuel types corroded in the experimental time period of 3.5 years completely, and secondary alteration phases were formed. After complete corrosion of the used research reactor fuel samples, the inventories of Cs and Sr were quantitatively detected in solution. Solution concentrations of Am and Eu were lower than the solubility of Am(OH)(3)(s) and Eu(OH)(3)(s) solid phases respectively, and may be controlled by sorption processes. Pu concentrations may be controlled by Pu(IV) polymer species, but the presence of Pu(V) and Pu(IV) oxyhydroxides species due to radiolytic effects cannot completely be ruled out. Solution concentrations of U were within the range of the solubility limits of the solid phase U(OH)(4)(am). The determined concentrations of U and Am in solution were about one order of magnitude higher for the U(3)Si(2)-Al fuel sample. Here, the formation of U/Si containing secondary phase components and their influence on radionuclide solubility cannot be ruled out. Results of this work show that the U(3)Si(2)-Al and UAl(x)-Al dispersed research reactor spent fuel samples dissolved completely within the test period of 3.5 years in MgCl(2)-rich brine in the presence of Fe(2+). In view of final disposal this means that these fuel matrices represent no barrier. The radionuclides will be released instantaneously. Cs (the long-lived isotope (135)Cs is of special concern with respect to final disposal) and Sr were classified as mobile radionuclide species. For U, Am, Pu and Eu, a reimmobilization was observed. Sorption is the process which is assumed to be responsible for the reimmobilization of the long-lived actinide Am and the lanthanide Eu. Solution concentrations of U and Pu seem to be controlled by their solubility controlling solid phases. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Krypton and helium irradiation damage in neodymium-zirconolite	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							ION IRRADIATION; AMORPHIZATION; PYROCHLORE; PEROVSKITE	A leading candidate for the immobilisation of actinides, zirconolite's suitability as a potential ceramic host for plutonium disposition, both in storage and geological disposal, has been the subject of much research. One key aim of this study is to understand the effects of radiation damage and noble gas accommodation within the zirconolite material. To this end, a series of ex situ irradiations have been performed on polycrystalline (Ca(0.8)Nd(0.2))Zr(Ti(1.8)Al(0.2))O(7) zirconolite samples. Zirconolite samples, doped with Nd(3+) (as a Pu surrogate) on the Ca-site and charge-balanced by substituting Al(3+) onto the Ti-site, were irradiated with (36)Kr(+) (2 MeV) ions at fluences of 1 x 10(14) and 5 x 10(15) cm(-2) and (4)He(+) (200 ke) ions at fluences of 1 x 10(14), 5 x 10(15) and 1 x 10(17) cm(-2) to simulate the impact of alpha decay on the microstructure. Microstructural analysis revealed no damage present at the lower Kr(+) fluence, but that the higher (36)Kr(+) fluence rendered the zirconolite completely amorphous. Similarly, evidence of helium accumulation was only seen at the highest (4)He(+) fluence (1 x 10(17) cm(-2)). Monte Carlo simulations using the TRIM code predict the highest concentration of helium accumulating at a depth of 720 nm, in good agreement with the experimental observations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Glass ceramics for incinerator ash immobilization	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							RADIOACTIVE-WASTE	Calcined solid radioactive waste (incinerator slag) surrogate and either Na(2)Si(2)O(5) or Na(2)B(4)O(7) (borax) at various mass ratios were melted in silicon carbide crucibles in a resistive furnace at temperatures of up to 1775 K (slag without additives). Portions of the melts were poured onto a metal plate; the residues were slowly cooled in turned-off furnace. Both quenched and slowly cooled materials were composed of the same phases. At high slag contents in silicate-based materials nepheline and britholite were found to be major phases. Britholite formed at higher slag content (85 wt.%) became major phase in the vitrified slag. In the system with borax at low slag contents (25 and 50 wt.%) material are composed of predominant vitreous and minor calcium silicate larnite type phase Ca(2)SiO(4) where Ca(2+) ions are replaced by different cations. The materials containing slag in amount of 75 wt.% and more are chemically durable. The changes in the structure of anionic motif of quenched samples depending on slag loading were studied by IR spectroscopy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Malinina, G.

Helium diffusion in curium-doped borosilicate waste glass	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							NUCLEAR-WASTE; BEHAVIOR; SOLUBILITIES; IRRADIATION; PERMEATION; PLUTONIUM; URANIUM; ENERGY; OXIDES	The isothermal release of helium from (244)Cm-doped borosilicate glass has been studied as a function of time at different annealing temperatures. Helium measurements were performed using a micro gas chromatograph coupled to a furnace installed in a hot cell at ATALANTE nuclear research facility. Plane-parallel glass samples were prepared from glass discs that had been stored for 5.1 years at room temperature, accumulating around 10(19) alpha decays per gram of glass, a level that will be reached in current nuclear glass packages several thousand years after disposal. The experimental helium release data were simulated using a 3D numerical model to determine the helium diffusion coefficients. The extracted diffusion coefficients follow the Arrhenius law with an activation energy of 0.61 +/- 0.03 eV and a pre-exponential factor of (5.7 +/- 1.6) x 10(-3) cm(2) s(-1). The results were compared with literature data on damaged and undamaged glasses to assess the effect of glass damage on helium release. The helium release results are consistent with a thermal diffusion mechanism involving only one population of helium atoms. The helium diffusion coefficients were unaffected by the glass alpha damage. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
