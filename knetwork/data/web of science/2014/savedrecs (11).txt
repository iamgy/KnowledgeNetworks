TriPla-CA, which is a consortium of four EU laboratories aiming to support tritium relevant activities for ITER design is carrying out R&D and design for ITER Tritium Plant. Several rigs and experimental facilities have been enhanced and developed in order to explore a wide range of envisaged scenarios of some ITER Tritium Plant systems such as water detritiation system (WDS), isotope separation system and highly tritiated water processing. Beside the experimental activities, the enhancement of the relevant software for simulation and design of various tritium processing systems is ongoing. The main achievements concerning the R&D, the mechanical design including the seismic calculations of some ITER WDS components and the main expertize and the hardware available inside the consortium are presented.

On ion implantation and damage effect in Li2TiO3 as a fusion breeder blanket: A technological approach for degradation testing	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 15-20, 2013	Barcelona, SPAIN	Spanish Energy, Environm & Technol Res Ctr, Energy Res Inst Catalonia		Solid breeder blanket; Electrical and nuclear damage; Ion beam analysis; Raman; Photoluminescence; TEM microscopy	TRITIUM RELEASE; CERAMICS; MODEL	The present work is a technological approach to establish testing techniques able to evaluate the release of the two Li-transmutation products and characterize the degradation of Li2TiO3 as breeder material. In an attempt to find the outgassing/release temperature of light gases and to study its bulk diffusion, nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) was used for profiling the He-3 and D depth distributions of the as-implanted and damaged samples as a function of the annealing temperature. The defects generated by gamma-rays and heavy-ion (Ti4+) irradiation were characterized by microRaman spectroscopy and confocal microscopy luminescence (CML) techniques. Considering the relevance of the microstructure (porosity and grain size), the study was supported by transmission electron microscope (TEM) observations and Hg-porosimetry measurements. Concerning D-implanted samples, the results suggest the complete release at temperatures higher than 200 degrees C. On the other hand, the implanted He-3 desorbs continuously with temperature, a 7-8% still being measured at 700 degrees C. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Durability of ion exchange membrane has been demonstrated under the Broader Approach Activities. Long-term exposure of Nafion (R) ion exchange membrane in 1.38 x 10(12) Bq/kg of tritiated water was conducted at room temperature for up to 2 years. The ionic conductivity of Nafion (R) membrane after immersed in tritiated water was changed. The change in color of membrane from colorless to yellowish was caused by reactions of radicals on the polymer and oxygen molecules in air. Infrared Fourier transform spectrum of a yellowish membrane revealed a small peak for bending vibration of C-H situated at 1437 cm(-1), demonstrating the formation of hydrophobic functional group in the membrane. The hydrophilic network in Nafion membrane was partially obstructed by the hydrophobic free products. This caused the decrease in ionic conductivity. The peak for bending vibration was clearly eliminated in the spectrum of the membrane after treatment by acid for removal of free products. The high-resolution solid state F-19 NMR spectrum of a membrane after immersed in tritiated water was similar to that of a membrane irradiated with gamma-rays. From the F-19 NMR spectrum, no distinctive degradation in the membrane structure by interaction with tritium was measured. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Synthetic zeolite is often used as an adsorbent or a substrate of chemical exchange catalyst. And, it is well known that its property is changed easily by exchanging its cations. Synthetic mordenite is one of zeolites having fairly large silica/alumina ratio. There are many reports about hydrogen adsorption properties of cation-exchanged mordenite so far. And, the present authors also have reported that cation-exchanged mordenite with Ca ion (Ca-MOR) indicated fairly large hydrogen adsorption capacity at 77K in comparison with Molecular Sieves 5A (MS5A). So, in this work, hydrogen adsorption properties of cation-exchanged mordenite with transition metal ion were investigated mainly. The cation-exchanged mordenite with Ag ion (Ag-MOR) has indicated considerably large hydrogen adsorption capacity in lower pressure range at 77 K in comparison with Ca-MOR. The discussion from the viewpoint of adsorption rate is still remaining, but more compact cryosorption column for tritium recovery system is possible to design if Ag-MOR is adopted.

Comparison between post-HF, DFT approaches and available experimental data allows validation of the ability of an accurate exchange-correlation functional, VSXC, to predict the thermo-chemical properties of the beryllium species of interest. Deviation of enthalpy of formation induced by changes in hydrogen isotopy has been also calculated. From these new theoretically determinated data, we have calculated the chemical speciation in conditions simulating an accident of water ingress in the vacuum vessel of ITER. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Fuskite (R) preliminary experimental tests based on permeation against vacuum for hydrogen recovery as a potential application in Pb15.7Li loop systems	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 15-20, 2013	Barcelona, SPAIN	Spanish Energy, Environm & Technol Res Ctr, Energy Res Inst Catalonia		Tritium recovery; Pb15.7Li loop; Permeator against vacuum; Selective laser melting		Tritium recovery in fusion reactors is one of the main goals in R&D, as a limited inventory is available and its uneconomic production. That is the reason why efficient technologies are indispensable to be developed in order to achieve fast tritium recovery and its subsequent reuse in the system for increasing its self-sufficiency. In this work a flexible tritium recovery demonstrator prototype based on permeation against vacuum concept has been designed and manufactured, as well as all necessary equipment for a Pb15.7Li loop implementation in order to test and demonstrate that an in-pipe integrated solution is possible, and at the same time, to validate the manufacturing process. Thus, efficient rates for more optimized future models could be then extrapolated. The aim of this paper is to show the different testing results that have been carried out in this research project. These results include permeation properties of the material considered for the permeator, as long as it has been manufactured with a novel technique, Selective Laser Melting. They also include vacuum tests on the permeator to quantify possible leakages and to set up and analyze the capability to generate vacuum inside the permeator, and finally, permeation tests with the prototype, in a first stage with a gas mixture of hydrogen and argon inside the loop instead of Pb15.7Li.

Recently the ITER fuelling scenarios have been developed in more detail considering ramp-up, flat-top, and ramp-down. With this as input, an alternative analysis was performed for how SOS will support ITER inductive, hybrid, and non-inductive plasma operations. The fuelling rates from SDS to FS were evaluated. To supply gas to FS, SDS must draw gases from one or more sources. These sources could be SDS tanks, SDS hydride storage beds or the Isotope Separation System. Case studies were performed to evaluate the relative merits on various configurations. For inductive operations, it was found that tritium could be supplied with either 27 hydride beds and one tank or with 12 beds and four tanks. For deuterium supply the results were either 43 beds and one tank or 31 beds and four tanks. Also studied were options for distributing supporting gas inventories elsewhere in the Fuel Cycle or on larger hydride beds. Evaluation criteria included operability and safety.

These steels contain elements that produce radioactive isotopes and decay to low levels in timeframe required by the waste management scenario. Developments within the past quarter-century suggest a practical limit to the removal of undesired impurities such as Co, Cu, Ni, Mo and Nb. The concentrations of elements essential for the mechanical properties of RAFM steels, such as Al and N, required a compromise between the waste disposal scenario and performance demand. The limits and potential of RAFM steel pertaining to reducing the activation levels after service are discussed based on the actual achievements of F82H, Japanese RAFM steel, and numerical analyses of the activity. It was found that in order to achieve the shallow land burial limits 100 years after a reactor shutdown, Ni is the most significant impurity that must be removed (Mo in the case of the first wall). Limiting N below concentrations of 100 ppm will not be possible for a large scale melt, but concentrations of Al up to the maximum amount that has been achieved present no problems.

General recommendations include: (1) Research should be preferentially focused on the most technologically advanced options (i.e., options that have been developed at least through the single-effects concept exploration stage, technology readiness levels >3), (2) Significant near-term progress can be achieved by modifying existing facilities and/or moderate investment in new medium-scale facilities, and (3) Computational modeling for fusion nuclear sciences is generally not yet sufficiently robust to enable truly predictive results to be obtained, but large reductions in risk, cost and schedule can be achieved by careful integration of experiment and modeling.

Tritium produced in the pebble bed of TRTM is swept out continuously by a purge gas flow, but can also permeate into the module's metal structures, and can be lost by permeation to the environment. According analyses on the tritium inventory are performed to support IFMIF plant safety studies, and to support the experiment planning. This paper describes the necessary elements for calculation of the tritium transport in the Tritium Release Test Module as follows: (i) applied equations for the tritium balance, (ii) material data from literature and (iii) the topological models and the computation of the five different cases; namely release of tritium from the breeder solid material into the purge gas, loss of tritium over the capsule wall, rig hull, container wall and purge gas return line in detail. The problem of tritium transport in the TRIM has been studied and analyzed by the Tritium Migration Analysis Program (TMAP) and the adapted fusion-devoted Tritium Permeation Code (FUS-TPC). TMAP has been developed at INEEL and now exists in Version 7. FUS-TPC Code was written in MATLAB with the original purpose to study the tritium transport in Helium Cooled lead Lithium (HCLL) blanket and in a later version the Helium Cooled Pebble Bed (HCPB) blanket by [6] (Franza, 2012). This code has been further modified to be applicable to the TRIM. Results from the computations for the five computational cases concerning safety and experiment analyses are presented.

Oxidation behaviour of bulk W-Cr-Ti alloys prepared by mechanical alloying and HIPing	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 15-20, 2013	Barcelona, SPAIN	Spanish Energy, Environm & Technol Res Ctr, Energy Res Inst Catalonia		Tungsten alloys; Oxidation resistance; Armour material; Mechanical alloying; HIP	PLASMA-FACING MATERIAL; TUNGSTEN; FUSION	Self-passivating tungsten based alloys are expected to provide a major safety advantage compared to pure tungsten when used as first wall armour of future fusion reactors, due to the formation of a protective oxide scale, preventing the formation of volatile and radioactive WO3 in case of a loss of coolant accident with simultaneous air ingress. In this work results of isothermal oxidations tests at 800 and 1000 degrees C on bulk alloy WCr12Ti2.5 performed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and by exposure to flowing air in a furnace are presented. In both cases a thin, dense Cr2O3 layer is found at the outer surface, below which a Cr2WO6 scale and Ti2CrO5 layers alternating with WO3 are formed. The Cr2O3, Cr2WO6 and Ti2CrO5 scales act as protective barriers against fast inward O2- diffusion. The oxidation kinetics seems to be linear for the furnace exposure tests while for the TGA tests at 800 degrees C the kinetics is first parabolic, transforming into linear after an initial phase. The linear oxidation rates are 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than for pure W. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The experimental measurements were performed over the temperature range of 423-823 K and for high purity hydrogen loading pressures ranging from 1.0 x 10(4) Pa to 1.5 x 10(5) Pa. We observed that the permeability obtained for the pure Fe metal and for the two alloys containing 5% and 10% Cr follows an Arrhenius law in each case for this temperature range. For the alloy containing 14% Cr, two different Arrhenius fittings were needed: one for high temperatures (above 710 K) and another one for low temperatures. In general terms, the increase in the Cr content in the alloy leads to smaller values of the permeability. Regarding diffusivity and Sieverts' constant, trapping effects have been observed for the alloys containing Cr. These effects lead to a sudden decrease of the diffusivity together with an increase of the Sieverts' constant at low temperatures. This phenomenon was detected at temperatures below 473 K, 523 K and 573 K for the Fe5%Cr alloy, Fe10%Cr alloy and Fe14%Cr alloy, respectively. According to the results, the influence of the metallurgical composition of Cr in Fe alloys on the transport parameters and trapping of hydrogen is discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Those activities are implemented mainly at the Rokkasho BA site in collaboration with universities in Japan. In the R&D on SiCf/SiC composites for an advanced blanket material, mechanical properties of chemically vapor infiltrated (CVO SiCf/SiC composites have been obtained in high temperature vacuum environment up to 1000 C. As to R&D on the tritium technology, tritium retention of the fine-grained re-crystallized tungsten has been evaluated. On reduced activation of ferritic/martensitic (RAFM) steels as the blanket structural material, a 20-ton heat of the F82H RAFM steel has been successfully produced in an electric arc furnace. Advanced neutron multiplier pebbles of beryllide (beryllium titanium alloy) have been fabricated using a dedicated rotating electrode apparatus followed by annealing from the beryllide rod produced with the plasma sintering method. Also advanced tritium breeder pebbles of lithium-rich lithium titanate have been fabricated by an emulsion method, where the grain size, confirmed by SEM, was less than 5 rim. Tritium recovery tests of advanced tritium breeder pebbles will be investigated under 14 MeV neutron irradiation as one of the new activities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

FFHR Design Grp	Analysis of radiation environment at divertor in helical reactor FFHR-d1	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						Helical reactor; Neutronics; Divertor; Irradiation damage; Cu materials; Radioactivation	DESIGN	Neutron transport calculations with a three-dimensional model of the helical reactor FFHR-d1 have been performed for the accurate analysis of neutronics environment in the divertor areas. Based on the obtained neutron spectra, magnitudes of irradiation damage, contact dose rates and decay heat have been evaluated mainly for Fe, W and Cu. Since divertors can be placed behind radiation shields in helical reactors, magnitudes of damage and radioactivation at the outboard divertors are almost two orders lower than those at blanket first walls. Cu materials could be used as a cooling channel material of the outboard divertors. In contrast, the magnitudes at the inboard divertors are only one order lower compared with those at the first walls due to the limited space at the inboard side. Damage on Cu is evaluated to be similar to 10 dpa after 6 years operation. Further efforts in divertor development and reactor design could suppress the magnitude of damage to less than half for adoption of Cu materials for the inboard divertors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Nuclear analysis of the IFMIF European lithium target assembly system	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						IFMIF; Target assembly; Bayonet backplate; Neutronics; Activation		In the framework of the Engineering Validation and Engineering Design Activities (EVEDA) phase of the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF) project, ENEA was in charge of the design of the European version of the target assembly (TA) system which employs a removable bayonet backplate (BP) concept. With the aim of assessing the nuclear behaviour of the system and supplying the necessary input data to the thermomechanical analysis, coupled neutron-gamma transport calculations have been carried out for the whole TA + BP system, using the MCNP5 1.6 Monte Carlo transport code integrated with the McDeLicious-11 neutron source code provided by KIT. Neutron activation calculations have been performed by means of the EASY-2010 activation system in order to provide radioactive inventories useful for thermomechanical analysis and safety purposes. This paper summarizes the results obtained by the neutronic and activation calculations for the most irradiated components of the TA, such as backplate, frame, nozzle and target chamber.

The neutronic simulations were carried out with the MCNP5 code using a full scale 3D torus sector model of the DEMO reactor. The model was generated with the McCad conversion tool from available CAD models using a consistent integral approach. The neutronic analyses addressed the tritium breeding performance, the nuclear power generation and the shielding capabilities of the reactor. Although tritium self-sufficiency was shown, the tritium breeding performance of the current design calls for further design improvements to arrive at a higher uncertainty margin. The shielding performance of the reactor is close to the limit. Sufficient shielding can be easily provided by a slight increase of the inboard shield thickness.

Normal operation and maintenance safety lessons from the ITER US PbLi test blanket module program for a US FNSF and DEMO	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						Fusion; Safety; DCLL; DEMO; PbLi; Blanket	LITHIUM; DESIGN; TBM	A leading power reactor breeding blanket candidate for a fusion demonstration power plant (DEMO) being pursued by the US Fusion Community is the Dual Coolant Lead Lithium (DCLL) concept. The safety hazards associated with the DCLL concept as a reactor blanket have been examined in several US design studies. These studies identify the largest radiological hazards as those associated with the dust generation by plasma erosion of plasma blanket module first walls, oxidation of blanket structures at high temperature in air or steam, inventories of tritium bred in or permeating through the ferritic steel structures of the blanket module and blanket support systems, and the Po-210 and Hg-203 produced in the PbLi breeder/coolant. What these studies lack is the scrutiny associated with a licensing review of the DCLL concept. An insight into this process was gained during the US participation in the ITER Test Blanket Module (TBM) Program. In this paper we discuss the lessons learned during this activity and make safety proposals for the design of a Fusion Nuclear Science Facility (FNSF) or a DEMO that employs a lead lithium breeding blanket.

J	Taylor, N; Cortes, P				Taylor, Neill; Cortes, Pierre			Lessons learnt from ITER safety & licensing for DEMO and future nuclear fusion facilities	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						Safety; Licensing; Environmental impact; ITER; DEMO	POWER-PLANT	One of the strong motivations for pursuing the development of fusion energy is its potentially low environmental impact and very good safety performance. But this safety and environmental potential can only be fully realized by careful design choices. For DEMO and other fusion facilities that will require nuclear licensing, S&E objectives and criteria should be set at an early stage and taken into account when choosing basic design options and throughout the design process. Studies in recent decades of the safety of fusion power plant concepts give a useful basis on which to build the S&E approach and to assess the impact of design choices. The experience of licensing ITER is of particular value, even though there are some important differences between ITER and DEMO. The ITER project has developed a safety case, produced a preliminary safety report and had it examined by the French nuclear safety authorities, leading to the licence to construct the facility. The key technical issues that arose during this process are recalled, particularly those that may also have an impact on DEMO safety.

The strategy for handling fusion activated materials calls for three potential schemes: clearance, recycling and disposal. There is a growing international effort to avoid the underground disposal, for fusion in particular. Plasma facing components (divertor and blanket) normally contain high radioactivity and are not clearable. As clearance of sizeable components (such as biological shield, cryostat, vacuum vessel, and some constituents of magnets) is highly desirable, we identified the source of radioisotopes that hinder the clearance of these components and investigated the impact of impurity control. Another study assessed radioactivity build-up under repeated use of the divertor made of W La2O3 alloy. Effect of impurities on activated materials management is illustrated by the examples of carbon-14 generation and impurities activation in concrete of biological shield. We think that consideration of activated materials management scenarios presented in this paper by example of blanket and divertor replacement is of interest as well. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

JT-60 Team	Safe disassembly and storage of radioactive components of JT-60U torus	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						Disassembly; JT-60U; Radioactivation; Fusion device; Clearance; JT-60SA		Disassembly of the JT-60U torus was started in 2009 after 18 years of D-2 operations and was completed in October 2012 for assembling the JT-60SA torus at the same position. The JT-60U torus was featured by the complicated and welded structure against the strong electromagnetic force, and by the radioactivation due to deuterium-deuterium (D-D) reactions. Since this work is the first experience of disassembling a large radioactivated fusion device in Japan, careful preparations of disassembly activities, including treatment of the radioactivated materials and safety work, have been made. During the disassembly period over 3 years, careful measures against exposure were taken and stringent control of exposure dose were implemented, and as a result, accumulated collective effective dose of similar to 41,000 person-day to workers was only similar to 22 mSv in total and no internal exposure was observed. About 13,000 components cut into pieces with measuring the contact dose were removed from the torus hall and stored safely in storage facilities. The total weight of the disassembly components reached up to similar to 5400 tonnes. Most of the disassembly components will be treated as non-radioactive ones after the clearance level inspection under the Japanese regulations in the future. The assembly of JT-60SA has started in January 2013 after this disassembly of JT-60U torus. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Among seven selected reference accidents in Korean TBS, in-box loss of coolant accident (LOCA) is one of them. This is initiated by a double-ended break of the coolant pipe in the Breeding Zone (BZ), pressurizing the BZ box structure, causing pressurization of the Tritium Extraction System (TES) and purging of pipelines. When the accident is detected, the Plant Safety System (PSS) isolates the Helium Cooling System (HCS) and TES, and requests plasma shutdown to Fusion Power Shutdown System (FPSS). To prevent aggravating failure of the system, the safety function is automatically activated when the accident is detected, the device being the isolation valve of HCS and TES. One important observation of this accident is that instant isolation is not a good measure to take. In terms of the possibility of aggravating failure, system isolation is an important safety procedure but isolated TES volume is exposed to high pressure and temperature conditions in the early move of the accident transient. The result of system safety analysis shows that delayed isolation keeps the system safe for a while. In this article, given the preliminary accident analysis results for the current HCCR TBS, case studies were performed regarding the delayed isolation timing effect. For this transient simulation, Korean nuclear fusion reactor safety analysis code (GAMMA-FR) was used. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Study of safety features and accident scenarios in a fusion DEMO reactor	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						DEMO; Safety; Source term analysis; Accident scenario analysis	DESIGN	After the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear accident, a need for assuring safety of fusion energy has grown in the Japanese (JA) fusion research community. DEMO safety research has been launched as a part of Broader Approach DEMO Design Activities (BA-DDA). This paper reports progress in the fusion DEMO safety research conducted under BA-DDA. Safety requirements and evaluation guidelines have been, first of all, established based on those established in the Japanese ITER site invitation activities. The radioactive source terms and energies that can mobilize such source terms have been assessed for a reference DEMO concept. This concept employs in-vessel components that are cooled by pressurized water and built of a low activation ferritic steel (F82H), contains solid pebble beds made of lithium-titanate (Li2TiO3) and beryllium titanium (Be12Ti) for tritium breeding and neutron multiplication, respectively. It is shown that unlike the energies expected in ITER, the enthalpy in the first wall/blanket cooling loops is large compared to the other energies expected in the reference DEMO concept. Reference accident event sequences in the reference DEMO in this study have been analyzed based on the Master Logic Diagram and Functional Failure Mode and Effect Analysis techniques. Accident events of particular concern in the DEMO have been selected based on the event sequence analysis and the hazard assessment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the replacement period of a fusion power reactor, the assembly of blanket or divertor modules needs to be removed from the reactor in order to minimize remote maintenance in the vacuum vessel and to attain reasonable plant availability. In the hot cell, the modules will be removed from the back plate of the assembly. Here, note that the active cooling must be done by a way that does not cause contamination of the hot cell environment due to dispersion of tritium and tungsten dust. In this sense, the cooling scenario is adopted that the existing pipe of cooling water in the assembly is connected to a different cooling water system in the hot cell. On the other hand, it is assumed that the structural material (F82H) of the blanket and divertor is not recycled due to its high contact dose rate. It should be crushed into small pieces to reduce volume of the waste and required storage space. In this paper, the basic idea of the waste management scenario and the conceptual design in the hot cell and waste storage for DEMO has been proposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The dually cooled breeding zone is composed of He/LiPb and SiC as material of the liquid metal flow channel inserts. Structural materials are ferritic-martensitic steel (Eurofer) for the blanket and austenitic steel (SS316LN) for the vacuum vessel (VV) and the cryostat. In this work, radioactive wastes are assessed in order to determine if they can be disposed as low and intermediate level radioactive waste (LILW) in the Spanish near surface disposal facility of El Cabril. Also, unconditional clearance and recycling waste management options are studied. The neutron transport calculations have been performed with MCNPX code, while the ACAS code is used for calculations of the inventory of activation products and for activation analysis, in terms of waste management ratings for the options considered. Results show that the total amount of the cryostat can be disposed in El Cabril joined to the outer layer of both VV and channel inserts, whereas only concrete-made biological shield can be managed through clearance and none of the steels can be recycled. Those results are compared with those corresponding to French regulation, showing similar conclusions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

LIPAc generates a 9 MeV deuteron beam, which is stopped at a beam dump, depositing over 1 MW of thermal power. A water cooling system has been devised for extracting this energy while keeping operational temperatures within range. The existing high neutron fluxes in the beam dump during operation produce activation of both coolant and beam stopper, which also suffers from corrosion into the coolant. The presence of radioisotopes in the cooling water leads to a radiological hazard. Water purification systems are located outside the accelerator vault and accumulate activated products during filtration, requiring a specific radiological shield to comply with target dose rates. Also devices containing large volume of activated cooling water, like N-16 decay pipes, require specific radioprotection analysis and design. This work identifies the most relevant radiation sources due to the activated cooling fluid, which may result in radiation doses to workers, and propose radioprotection measures into the design to mitigate their effect.

Penetration of tritiated water vapor through hydrophobic paints for concrete materials	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						Tritium; Permeation; Concrete; Epoxy paint; Silicon paint	TRITIUM; BEHAVIOR	Behavior of tritium transfer through hydrophobic paints of epoxy and acrylic-silicon resin was investigated experimentally. The amounts of tritium permeating through their paint membranes were measured under the HTO concentration condition of 2-96 Bq/cm(3). Most of tritium permeated through the paints as a molecular form of HTO at room temperature. The rate of tritium permeating through the acrylic-silicon paint was correlated in terms of a linear sorption/release model, and that through the epoxy paint was controlled by a diffusion model. Although effective diffusivity estimated by a diffusion model was obtained 1.1 x 10(-13)-1.8 x 10(-13) m(2)/s for epoxy membranes at the temperature of 21-26 degrees C, its value was found to be hundreds times larger than that for cement-paste coated with epoxy paint. Hence, resistance of tritium diffusion through interface between cement-paste and the epoxy paint was considered to be the most effective in the overall tritium transfer process. Clarification of tritium transfer behavior at the interface is important to understand the mechanism of tritium transfer in concrete walls coated with various paints. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In the present work we evaluate the temporal evolution of the radioactive species in the main in-vessel components after the end of the future DT campaign, assuming different levels of neutron irradiation. The neutron flux in the selected components is calculated by the MCNP5 code using the emission source by a typical DT plasma. The resulting neutron spectra are then input to the FISPACT code that computes the evolution of the radioactive species generated by the neutron activation process. For each irradiation scenario, the time behavior of the contact dose rate is determined. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Vuolo, M.; Bonifetto, R.; Dulla, S.; Ravetto, P.; Richard, L.

Tritium and heat management in ITER Test Blanket Systems port cell for maintenance operations	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						ITER; TBM; Breeding blanket; Tritium management		Three ITER equatorial port cells are dedicated to the assessment of six different designs of breeding blankets, known as Test Blanket Modules (TBMs). Several high temperature components and pipework will be present in each TBM port cell and will release a significant quantity of heat that has to be extracted in order to avoid the ambient air and concrete wall temperatures to exceed allowable limits. Moreover, from these components and pipes, a fraction of the contained tritium permeates and/or leaks into the port cell. This paper describes the optimization of the heat extraction management during operation, and the tritium concentration control required for entry into the port cell to proceed with the required maintenance operations after the plasma shutdown.

Dust tracking techniques applied to the STARDUST facility: First results	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology (ISFNT)	SEP 15-20, 2013	Barcelona, SPAIN	Spanish Energy, Environm & Technol Res Ctr, Energy Res Inst Catalonia		Nuclear fusion plants; Security; Safety; Dust tracking; Computer vision; Particle image velocimetry (PIV)	TOKAMAK VACUUM VESSEL; FUSION-REACTOR; ALGORITHMS; SAFETY; EVENT	An important issue related to future nuclear fusion reactors fueled with deuterium and tritium is the creation of large amounts of dust due to several mechanisms (disruptions, ELMs and VDEs). The dust size expected in nuclear fusion experiments (such as ITER) is in the order of microns (between 0.1 and 1000 mu m). Almost the total amount of this dust remains in the vacuum vessel (VV). This radiological dust can re-suspend in case of LOVA (loss of vacuum accident) and these phenomena can cause explosions and serious damages to the health of the operators and to the integrity of the device. The authors have developed a facility, STARDUST, in order to reproduce the thermo fluid-dynamic conditions comparable to those expected inside the VV of the next generation of experiments such as ITER in case of LOVA. The dust used inside the STARDUST facility presents particle sizes and physical characteristics comparable with those that created inside the VV of nuclear fusion experiments. In this facility an experimental campaign has been conducted with the purpose of tracking the dust re-suspended at low pressurization rates (comparable to those expected in case of LOVA in ITER and suggested by the General Safety and Security Report ITER-GSSR) using a fast camera with a frame rate from 1000 to 10,000 images per second. The velocity fields of the mobilized dust are derived from the imaging of a two-dimensional slice of the flow illuminated by optically adapted laser beam. The aim of this work is to demonstrate the possibility of dust tracking by means of image processing with the objective of determining the velocity field values of dust re-suspended during a LOVA.

Soft housekeeping waste (e.g. gloves, tissues, protective clothes, etc.) is produced during the whole life as well as during the dismantling of the reactor and is contaminated by tritium under reduced (HT) and oxidized (HTO) forms. In collaboration with ENEA, a lab-scaled facility has been built at CEA Cadarache for soft housekeeping waste detritiation and tritium valorization. The previously milled waste is placed in a reactor to be heated up to a temperature lower than the housekeeping melting point. A carrier gas is then injected in the detritiation reactor to remove tritium, thanks to the combined effects of temperature and carrier gas (type and feed flow). The tritiated gas exhausted from the detritiation reactor is then sent through a catalytic Pd-Ag membrane reactor (CMR) where tritium is recovered via isotopic exchange reaction and permeation phenomenon. Based on previous studies that have allowed defining the most efficient operating conditions for the detritiation process, this work presents the results obtained by the coupling of the detritiation facility with the CMR. Due to safety considerations, restrictions on the nature of the carrier gas were applied, rejecting air as the carrier gas even though air was the best candidate for the detritiation part of the process. The performance of the whole system was estimated by means of a parametric study on the influence of flow rates in the CMR and transmembrane pressure. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The JT-60SA device is a fully superconducting tokamak capable of confining break-even equivalent deuterium plasmas with equilibria covering high plasma shaping with a low aspect ratio at a maximum plasma current of I-p = 5.5 MA. This makes JT-60SA capable to support and complement ITER in all the major areas of fusion plasma development necessary to decide DEMO reactor construction. After a complex start-up phase due to the necessity to carry out a re-baselining effort with the purpose to fit in the original budget while aiming to retain the machine mission, performance, and experimental flexibility, in 2009 detailed design could start. With the majority of time-critical industrial contracts in place, in 2012, it was possible to establish a credible time plan, and now, the project is progressing on schedule towards the first plasma in March 2019. After careful and focused R&D and qualification tests, the procurement of the major components and plant is now well advanced in manufacturing design and/or fabrication. In the meantime the disassembly of the JT-60U machine has been completed and the engineering of the JT-60SA assembly process has been developed. The actual assembly of JT-60SA started in January 2013 with the installation of the cryostat base. The paper gives an overview of the present status of the engineering design, manufacturing and assembly of the JT-60SA machine. (C) 2014 Fusion for Energy. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Such a facility, proposed by ENEA, reconsiders a previous study known as "Sorgentina" but takes into account new technological development so far attained. The "New Sorgentina" Fusion Source (NSFS) project is based upon an intense D-T 14 MeV neutron source achievable with T and D ion beams impinging on 2 m radius rotating targets. NSFS produces about 1 x 10(13) n cm(-2) s(-1) over about 50 cm(3). Larger volumes of lower neutron flux will be available (e.g. for TBM experiments) as well as collimated channels to study some features of the ITER neutron camera. The NSFS facility will overcome problems related to the ion source and accelerating system, by means of an upgraded version of the JET-PINI ion beams. NSFS has to be intended as an European facility that may be realized in a few years, once provided a preliminary technological program devoted to the operation of the ion source in continuous mode, target heat loading/removal, target and tritium handling, inventory as well as site licensing. In this contribution, the main characteristics of NSFS project will be presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the nuclear design, accurate nuclear data are needed. However, few benchmark experiments had been performed for titanium. We performed a benchmark experiment with a titanium assembly and a DT neutron source at JAEA/FNS. The titanium assembly was covered with Li2O blocks in order to reduce background neutrons. Dosimetry reaction rates were measured with niobium, indium and gold foils inside the assembly. And fission rates of U-235 were measured by using micro fission chambers. This experiment was analyzed by using the Monte Carlo neutron transport code MCNP5-1.40 with recent nuclear data libraries of ENDF/B-VII.0, ENDF/B-VII.1, JEFF-3.1.2, JENDL-4.0 and JENDL-4.0u1. The calculation results were compared with the measured one in order to validate the nuclear data libraries of titanium. The calculated results with ENDF/B-VII.1 agreed with the measured one the best because the (n,2n) and (n,n'(cont)) reaction cross section data and resonance parameters were improved.

TRIPOLI-4 (R) is a Monte Carlo code developed by CEA. The aim of this paper is to show its capability to model a large-scale fusion reactor with complex neutron source and geometry. A benchmark between MCNP5 and TRIPOLI-4 (R), on the ITER A-lite model was carried out; neutron flux, nuclear heating in the blankets and tritium production rate in the European TBMs were evaluated and compared. The methodology to build the TRIPOLI-4 (R) A-lite model is based on MCAM and the MCNP A-lite model. Simplified TBMs, from KIT, were integrated in the equatorial-port. A good agreement between MCNP and TRIPOLI-4 (R) is shown; discrepancies are mainly included in the statistical error. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The upgraded Hydrogen Isotope Inventory Processes Code (HIIPC) is applied with the incident depth profile provided by SRIM-2013 to make the study. The code is first verified by comparison with experimental measurements. The effects of the incident ion energy and ion flux on the retention are then studied. Finally, using the parameters obtained from EAST diagnostics, the HI retention inside the W divertor during ELMy H-mode is studied, which indicates the retained HI can be increased dramatically mainly due to ion-induced trap sites by ELMs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A flexible modular solution for the inclusion in maintenance operations is presented. The proposed heterogeneous modular robotic system is evaluated using simulations of the prototype across selected robot configuration to perform tasks. Results obtained show the advantages and ability of the modular robot to perform the necessary tasks as well as its ability to adapt and evolve depending on the need. The simulation test case inside hot cell shows modular robot configuration, a two modular arm to perform tele-operation tasks in the workspace and a wheeled platform for inspection collaborating to perform tasks. The advantage of using re-configurable modular robot over conventional robot platforms is shown. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper presents the design of a MGy radiation tolerant 16 bit resolver-to-digital converter (RDC) in 130 nm CMOS technology. The RDC features a Type II digital tracking loop, able to track resolvers with speeds up to 300 rps, and excitation frequencies up to 4 kHz. The RDC uses two integrated Delta Sigma-analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) to digitize the resolver outputs. The 16 bit, I 0 kHz ADCs utilize a correlated double sampling technique to remove radiation induced offset and 1/f-noise. The front-end features a static angular resolution of 16 bits (4.2 arcsec(rms)) and a resolution of 10 bits (6 arcmin(rms)) at a rotor speed of 100 rps. The circuit has a simulated radiation tolerance exceeding 1 MGy. It has the ability to operate under temperatures up to 125 degrees C, and to allow multiplexing with signals from other conventional sensors for compact, robust read-out architectures.

Concept for a vertical maintenance remote handling system for multi module blanket segments in DEMO	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						DEMO; Remote handling; MMS; Vertical Maintenance System		The anticipated high neutron flux, and the consequent damage to plasma-facing components in DEMO, results in the need to regularly replace the tritium breeding and radiation shielding blanket. The current European multi module segment (MMS) blanket concept favours a less invasive small port entry maintenance system over large sector transport concepts, because of the reduced impact on other tokamak systems particularly the magnetic coils. This paper presents a novel conceptual remote maintenance strategy for a Vertical Maintenance Scheme DEMO, incorporating substantiated designs for an in-vessel mover, to detach and attach the blanket segments, and cask-housed vertical maintenance devices to open and close access ports, cut and join service connections, and extract blanket segments from the vessel. In addition, a conceptual architectural model for DEMO was generated to capture functional and spatial interfaces between the remote maintenance equipment and other systems. Areas of further study are identified in order to comprehensively establish the feasibility of the proposed maintenance system. (C) 2014 EURATOM/CCFE Fusion Association. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The In-Vessel Transporter (IVT) will be introduced into the VV to remove the shield blanket modules for maintenance or replacement and later reinstall them. The IVT itself also needs to undergo regular maintenance in the Hot Cell Facility (HCF). It is assumed that maintenance workers will be exposed to radioactive dust that has adhered to the surfaces of the IVT. In this study, the areas of the IVT that may be contaminated by dust are evaluated to assess the level of exposure to workers during maintenance work in the HCF. Decontamination processes for the IVT, such as a combination of vacuuming and brushing, were investigated and the dose rate after these processes was evaluated. Even though dust was removed from surfaces where decontamination was possible, the dose rate was very high at some assessment points. To decrease the dose rate in accordance with ALARA policy, a decontamination plan and a maintenance plan, which includes the removal of dust, a radiation shield system, and a reduction in working time are proposed.

Aluminum-based barrier layers had proven their ability to protect the structural material from corrosion attack in flowing Pb-15.7Li and to reduce tritium permeation into the coolant. Coming from scales produced by hot dipping aluminization (HDA), the development of processes based on electrochemical methods to produce defined aluminum-based scales on RAFM steels gained attention in research during the last years. Two different electrochemical processes are proposed: The first one, referred to as ECA process, is based on the electrodeposition of aluminum from volatile, metal-organic electrolytes. The other process called ECX is based on ionic liquids. All three processes exhibit specific characteristics, for example in the field of processability, control of coating thicknesses (low activation criteria) and heat treatment behavior.

J	Thomas, J; Loving, A; Crofts, O; Morgan, R; Harman, J				Thomas, Justin; Loving, Antony; Crofts, Oliver; Morgan, Robert; Harman, Jon			DEMO Active Maintenance Facility concept progress 2012	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						DEMO; Remote handling; Hot cell; Maintenance; Active Maintenance Facility		The DEMO Active Maintenance Facility (AMF) would be used for the storage, handling and processing of In-Vessel Components (IVC) throughout their time on site, the only exception being the time that they are installed in the vessel. It is anticipated that all handling operations associated with used components will have to be carried out using remote handling techniques. During plasma operations the In-Vessel Components are exposed to high levels of neutron activation. This activation results in high radiation dose rates and decay heating. This presents a significant problem for Remote Handling Equipment (RHE) in the AMF. The high dose rates require the equipment to be sufficiently radiation tolerant to allow it to work reliably for long periods. The decay heating requires forced cooling of newly removed IVC's while they are in storage. The duration of the storage is dependent on the decay heating reducing to a level that has been nominally set at <50 degrees C without active cooling in room temperature air. This paper summarises the progress made in 2012 on the conceptual design of the AMF and its facilities. The layout and proposed function of the main areas will be described along with the principles applied. The design of the AMF has evolved from a simple representation of the required facilities in 2011 to a concept that can be developed to support maintenance of DEMO.

The cask and plug remote handling system (CPRHS) has been adopted as the solution to provide this nuclear confinement and transportation. This paper discusses the development of the conceptual design to-date and presents the processes being implemented to effectively control the subsequent CPRHS development. The CPRHS is a complex suite of systems with a significant number of interfaces with other ITER systems. Significant effort is being made to ensure that the system requirements are comprehensively defined and carefully managed and a feasible solution is developed - including planned and rescue operations. With the CPRHS performing a critical confinement function appropriate processes are being put in place to control the system development of the CPRHS. The expectation is that the combination of these factors will have a significant impact on the successful implementation of the CPRHS. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Scannapiego, M; Day, C; Hauer, V				Scannapiego, Matthieu; Day, Christian; Hauer, Volker			Consequences of plasma disruption mitigation by massive gas injection on the ITER torus cryopumping system	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						ITER; Vacuum; Cryopump; Regeneration; Disruption mitigation; Massive gas injection	MODEL PUMP; DESIGN	The ITER torus exhaust pumping system is based on six primary vacuum cryogenic pumps, and a rough and regeneration pumping system that can pump the exhaust gases from the torus cryopumps to the tritium plant. Massive gas injection is a proposed concept to mitigate plasma disruptions in ITER. The present paper identifies the limitations and down-times of the ITER torus pumping system after a massive gas injection event. Deuterium, helium, neon, and argon injections are discussed. The resulting high pressure in the torus is leading to high mass flows and heat fluxes to the cryogenic pumps, resulting in a significant and rapid temperature increase of the pumping surfaces normally cooled at 5K. However, the consequences on the torus pumping system operation depend on the gas species and quantities injected. Finally, the regeneration of the cryopumps, the rough pumping of the torus, and the overall torus pumping system turnover time until vacuum and thermal conditions for the start of the next plasma pulse are initiated again are discussed.

LIFE Team	Fusion technology aspects of laser inertial fusion energy (LIFE)	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						Inertial fusion energy; Power plant; Chamber; Breeder	PULSED IRRADIATION; CHAMBER; MICROSTRUCTURE; ENVIRONMENT; DAMAGE; WALL	This paper provides an overview of one option for LLNL's LIFE power plant design with a focus on the fusion nuclear science and technology aspects. The design is based on 132 MJ yield indirect-drive targets ignited by a diode pumped solid state laser that delivers 2.2 MJ on target at a pulse rate of 8.3 Hz for the first market entry plant (MEP) and 16.7 Hz for subsequent first generation commercial plants (FCP). The chamber first wall is steel which is protected from direct exposure to target X-ray and ion emissions by a Xe fill gas at similar to 6 mu g/cm(3). Reduced activation ferritic martensitic steel is proposed for the MEP while commercial plants will utilize higher strength, more radiation damage tolerate steels such as ODS, which can also operate at higher temperature for improved thermal efficiency and overall plant economics. Liquid Li is the primary coolant and tritium breeding material. An intermediate loop with molten salt as the working fluid transports power to a Rankine steam cycle; the estimated gross electric power conversion efficiency is 45% for the MEP and 47% for the FCP.

J	Hong, BG				Hong, B. G.			Conceptual study of fusion-driven system for nuclear waste transmutation	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						Fusion-driven system; Nuclear waste transmutation; LAR tokamak		A conceptual study of a fusion-driven system for nuclear waste transmutation using a low aspect ratio (LAR) tokamak as a neutron source is performed. A configuration of the LAR tokamak neutron source optimised with respect to both transmutation rate and the tritium breeding ratio for aspect ratio A in the range of 1.5-2.0 is found. The transmutation characteristics of both transuranic actinides and minor actinides are investigated and compared. When the transuranic actinides are loaded in the blanket, the neutron multiplication factor decreases from its initial value, k(eff) = 0.95, but with the minor actinides loaded in the blanket, the neutron multiplication factor shows a peak value during burn-up. The peak value can be controlled by adjusting the blanket dimensions. To transmute the nuclear waste effectively, an equilibrium fuel cycle is developed for both transuranic actinide and minor actinide transmutation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The physical and chemical properties of molten salts have been extensively studied in the nuclear fusion program. In recent years, molten salts technology began to be used in some engineering areas, in the advanced nuclear field and especially in nuclear fusion reactor systems. Nowadays, Aries team has developed advanced designs by using the molten salts technology in order to get high thermodynamic and structural advantage on nuclear technology areas (Tillack et al. in Fusion Energ Des 65:215-261, 2003; Tillack et al. in Fusion Energ Des 49-50:689-695, 2000; El-Guebaly et al. in Fusion Energ Des 65:263-284, 2003). The Aries-St reactors are a 1000 MW fusion reactor system that based on a low aspect ratio ST plasma (Tillack et al. in Fusion Energy Des 65:215-261, 2003; Tillack et al. in Fusion Energy Des 49-50:689-695, 2000). The Aries team studies especially on liquid walls concepts and this liquid are used to increase neutronic performance of various structures of Aries-St reactors. In this research, candidate molten salts have been studied neutron effects on reactor performance which are the first wall (FW) and blanket. There are various candidate liquids that meet all the criteria such as Li17Pb83, flibe(Li2BeF4) and LiNaBeF4, LiSn that are able to breed enough tritium. In this research, we used Li17Pb83, pure lithium and flibe as candidates that are in the Aries design. Montecarlo n-particle 4b-code is used for neutronics analysis and thermodynamic features. The value of tritium breeding ratio of the Aries-St reactors must be (TBR a parts per thousand yen 1.1). This can be achieved in the region of LiPb/FW blanket of reactors. Aries-St spherical reactor has high heat flux (0.8 MW/m(2)) and NWL (6-8 MW/m(2)) in this region.

The reactor has the equivalent scale compared with ITER, but has the complementary function to ITER. CFETR is a demonstration of long pulse or steady-state operation with duty cycle time not less than 0.3-0.5 and the full cycle of tritium self-sustained with TBR not less than 1.2. At the same time it will be exploring options for DEMO blanket and divertor with an easy changeable core by remote handling way. To be able to reach its scientific and technological objectives, as one of technical risks control methods, RAMI analysis need to be done during the hold lifetime of CFETR, from conception design to decommissioning. Base on stating of CFETR lifetime and preliminary operational programme, the RAMI analysis program and process are designed and discussed, it consists of five major steps: (1) functional analysis are performed, (2) calculating reliability block diagrams, (3) analyzing failure mode, effects and criticality analysis, (4) risk mitigation actions are taken to ensure every system is compatibility with RAMI objectives, (5) All the RAMI analysis are integrated as the final RAMI analysis reports to be reviewed in the system final design review. Along with the elements of the analysis the vacuum vessel (VV) system was performed to provide as examples, detailed showing how the CFETR RAMI analysis is carried out. CFETR RAMI analysis guidelines were designed and established, after constantly revised and improved these analysis criteria and programs will become the basis standards for CFETR RAMI analysis. Preliminary RAMI analysis of CFETR VV system was obtained, which will be updated with the VV system design progresses.

J	Lei, MZ; Song, YT; Ye, MY				Lei, Mingzhun; Song, Yuntao; Ye, Minyou			Application of Numerical Simulation in the Design of HECLIC Blanket for CFETR	JOURNAL OF FUSION ENERGY			English	Article						CFETR; Blanket; Numerical simulation; Design	TOKAMAK	China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor is a new tokamak device which is proposed by China National Integration Design Group. The fusion power is 50-200 MW and its plasma major radius and plasma minor radius are 5.7 and 1.6 m. The helium cooled lithium ceramic (HECLIC) blanket, as a key component of the tokamak, has the basic function to provide tritium breeding and plasma limiter. The blanket also provides main thermal and nuclear shielding of the vacuum vessel and ex-vessel components such as magnetic coils during plasma operations. With the development of the numerical simulation technology, more and more design parameters can be obtained by this method. Numerical simulation has been used for design and optimization, because some parameters are very hard to obtain though theoretical calculation. In this study, the simulation methods are investigated for HECLIC blanket design. Besides, design flow of the blanket is discussed and related analysis is also introduced to improve the design.
