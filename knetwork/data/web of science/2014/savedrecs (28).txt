Transmission of ultra-cold neutrons through guides coated with materials of high optical potential	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Ultra-cold neutrons; Ultra-cold neutron guides; Ultra-cold neutron transmission	DIAMOND-LIKE CARBON; SOLID DEUTERIUM SOURCE; LIFETIME; STORAGE; PHYSICS; FOILS; TRAP	We have measured the transmission of ultra-cold neutrons (UCN) through tubes coated on the inside with materials of high optical potentials. The best transmission value, T, normalised to 1 m long UCN guides was obtained with a beryllium coated quartz guide, T=(99.0 +/- 1.0)%. Furthermore, excellent transmission coefficients were found for (i) a glass tube coated with NiMo(88/12), T=(97.3 +/- 0.6)%, (ii) a NiMo(85/15) guide made by the replication technique, T (97.1 +/- 0.8)% and (iii) a glass guide coated with NiMo(82/18), T=(96.3 +/- 2.1)%. The results demonstrate that UCN guides made from coated glass tubes have the same excellent transmission properties as those produced with the replication technique. They are, however, significantly cheaper. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Characterization of a GEM-based fast neutron detector	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Neutron detector; GEM; Fusion	GAS ELECTRON MULTIPLIER; GENERATOR	The neutron efficiency of a Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM)-based detector designed for fast neutron measurements in fusion devices was determined through the combined use of Monte Carlo (MCNPX) calculations and analysis of deuterium-deuterium and deuterium-tritium neutron irradiation experiments. The detector, characterized by a triple GEM structure flushed with a Ar/CO2/CF4 - 45/15/40 gas mixture, features a digital read-out system and has two sub-units for the detection of 2.5 + 14 MeV neutrons and 14 MeV neutrons (U-DD and U-DT, respectively). The pulse height spectra (PHS) determined from the curves of experimental efficiency as a function of the detector's high voltage (HV) and the MCNPX-simulated PHS were compared using a fitting routine that finds the best match between the experimental and simulated PHS by assuming a parametric model for the relation between HV (that determines the detector's gain) and the energy deposited in the gas. This led to express the experimental neutron efficiency as a function of the discrimination level set on the deposited energy (energy threshold). The detector sensitivity to gamma-rays was also analyzed and the operational range in which the gamma-ray contribution to the signal is not negligible was determined It is found that this detector can reach a maximum neutron efficiency of similar to 1 x 10(-3) counts/it at 2.5 MeV (U-DD sub unit) and of similar to 4 x 10(-3) counts/n at 14 MeV (U-DT and U-DD sub units) (C) 2014 EURATOM ENEA.

Micropores were formed in the bituminized waste by the leaching of soluble salts. The penetrability of bitumen and the salt content affected the size and the shape of the micropores observed by scanning electron microscopy. The linear relationship between leaching fraction of the soluble components and square root of leaching time was observed, and the diffusion coefficient of the soluble component was determined by Fick's law. The diffusion coefficients of ionic species of interest were similar to each other. Moreover, the diffusion coefficient agreed among bituminized wastes with the same salt content, even if salt composition and bitumen matrix were different. The diffusion coefficient of the component was proportional to the salt content in the synthetic bituminized wastes. It was found that the salt content in the bituminized waste was one of the key factors to determine the diffusion coefficient.

It is essential to evaluate the hydrogen flux into the sodium coolant through the heat transfer tubes in a steam generator to understand the hydrogen behavior in an FBR plant. This study shows the time and temperature dependence of hydrogen flux using data obtained in the power rising test of the prototype FBR, Monju, and using the analysis code that can simulate the hydrogen distribution in an FBR plant. The hydrogen flux evaluated by the code gradually decreased with operating time, following the parabolic oxidation law and the Arrhenius relation over a wide range of steam temperatures. The results agreed with the hydrogen fluxes of other FBR plants evaluated in the past. It was also found that the hydrogen flux was mainly controlled by permeation through the heat transfer tubes, rather than the corrosion at the water side of the heat transfer tubes.

It was realized by subtracting the electrons produced in Cs-134 and Cs-137 from entire electron emission rate that can be determined by the efficiency tracer technique in the 4- coincidence counting method. The radioactivity of Cs-134 and Cs-137 can be determined by gamma ray spectrometry. The measurements were conducted using plastic and NaI(Tl) scintillation detector with a large solid angle. The validity of the measurement method was shown by agreement of the results with the known radioactivities.

At the present time the IAEA provides numerous opportunities for the training of managers and experts representing national programmes, regulatory bodies, and organizations related to RWM, and staff of national regulatory bodies responsible for licensing and inspection of such facilities, either through bilateral agreements or through the mechanism of thematic networks. The training events may be lecture based or comprise hands-on training, or may be a combination of the two. However, it is recognised that there are some limitations in the current approach. In order to overcome these limitations, the IAEA is committed to identify and utilise alternative and more cost effective avenues for the delivery of its training. To this end a decision has been made to develop a comprehensive RWM curriculum that jointly covers aspects of both safety and technology with an appropriate balance and that ensures that the two dimensions are delivered in a complimentary and consistent manner, including integration where appropriate. The training materials that will result from the development of the curriculum will be delivered through the medium of the internet and personal computers (eLearning) and also through extended face-face courses to be delivered in Regional Centres of Learning (which are still to be established). The curriculum will be developed collaboratively between the IAEA, international experts and the learning centres.

J	Sokcic-Kostic, M; Schultheis, R				Sokcic-Kostic, Marina; Schultheis, Roland			Measurement Methods for Radiological Characterisation of Low-Active and Mid-Active Radioactive Waste for Emplacement	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								For radiological classification and characterisation of radioactive waste - as it is here considered - the specification of a multitude of parameters is necessary. The measurement or rather definition of parameter ought to guarantee, that waste packages can be handled safely, that radioactive waste repository corresponds to the respective waste and that safety of emplacement is assured. From the parameters further properties of waste, such as the share of long-living isotopes, as well as activity limiting values, are deducted. For this purpose necessary measurements can be divided into non-destructive and destructive ones. The validity, sensitiveness and accuracy of both measurement methods differ. For the destructive methods, samples from the waste packages are retrieved and examined at the laboratory. In case of non-destructive methods, the entire package is scanned, whereby depending on the nuclides and their specific emissions (Gamma- and Neutron radiation, both the Beta- as well as Alpha- radiation) specific measurement methods arise. Available methods are evaluated and introduced with regard to accuracy, reliability as well as handling. Regarding the hardware- with exception of neutron evaluation technics - progress lies less in the development of new methods, rather than in the production line of robust and reliable measurement devices, which can be applied in automated infrastructures. During the evaluation routine simulation with the Monte-Carlo-Methods establishes itself more and more. Main focus regarding changes lies nevertheless in the introduction of the Bayes-Theory, which calculates consistently, and reliably measurement values and their errors, as well as trust intervals.

External dose rates were measured on 48 hyperthyroid patients using a survey meter in front of patients' thyroid glands. The initial measurement was recorded within 30 min post radioiodine administration at 0.3 m, 0.6 m, 1 m, and 2 m. Follow-up measurements were carried out up to 12 d post radioiodine administration. In addition, ambient dose rates of different locations such as wards, patients' washrooms, medical staffs' workplaces, and corridors were also measured. TheNa(131)I treatment dose administered in this study ranged from 74-555 MBq. Significant positive correlation between dose rate at 1 m and the administered dose was found in this study. The normalized external dose rates at 0.3 m were 0.234 mu Sv h(-1) MBq(-1) at 0.5 h, 0.325 mu Sv h(-1) MBq(-1) at 4 h, 0.308 mu Sv h(-1) MBq(-1) at 6 h, 0.301 mu Sv h(-1) MBq(-1) at 24 h, 0.259 mu Sv h(-1) MBq(-1) at 48 h, 0.234 mu Sv h(-1) MBq(-1) at 72 h, 0.224 mu Sv h(-1) MBq(-1) at 96 h, 0.186 mu Sv h(-1) MBq(-1) at 120 h, and 0.158 mu Sv h(-1) MBq(-1) at 144 h, respectively. With these results, the authors estimated radioactive radiation dose for the public and medical staffs near I-131-treated hyperthyroid patients. This study is beneficial for radiation safety decision-making.

S. National Cancer Institute initiated a cohort study of children and adolescents exposed to Chornobyl fallout in Ukraine to better understand the long-term health effects of exposure to radioactive iodines. All 13,204 cohort members were subjected to at least one direct thyroid measurement between 30 April and 30 June 1986 and resided at the time of the accident in the northern parts of Kyiv, Zhytomyr, or Chernihiv Oblasts, which were the most contaminated territories of Ukraine as a result of radioactive fallout from the Chornobyl accident. Thyroid doses for the cohort members, which had been estimated following the first round of interviews, were re-evaluated following the second round of interviews. The revised thyroid doses range from 0.35 mGy to 42 Gy, with 95% of the doses between 1 mGy and 4.2 Gy, an arithmetic mean of 0.65 Gy, and a geometric mean of 0.19 Gy. These means are 70% of the previous estimates, mainly because of the use of country-specific thyroid masses. Many of the individual thyroid dose estimates show substantial differences because of the use of an improved questionnaire for the second round of interviews. Limitations of the current set of thyroid dose estimates are discussed. For the epidemiologic study, the most notable improvement is a revised assessment of the uncertainties, as shared and unshared uncertainties in the parameter values were considered in the calculation of the 1,000 stochastic estimates of thyroid dose for each cohort member. This procedure makes it possible to perform a more realistic risk analysis.

ENERGY DEPENDENT CHEST WALL THICKNESS EQUATIONS FOR MALE LUNG MONITORING WITH GERMANIUM DETECTORS	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						241Am; calibration; detector; germanium; nuclear workers	DOSIMETRIC IMPLICATIONS; LIVERMORE PHANTOM; URANIUM INDUSTRY; FEMALE WORKERS; PLUTONIUM	The thickness and fat fraction of the chest wall are important parameters for in vivo lung monitoring. They have been measured from ultrasonic images on 374 male workers of the French nuclear industry using four measurement locations, as dictated by the size and position of the germanium detectors used for monitoring. The plastic muscle equivalent chest wall thickness (PMECWT) and the plastic 50% muscle-50% adipose equivalent chest wall thickness (X-5050) have been calculated for each worker at 17, 59.5, and 185.7 keV, respectively. Multi-linear regression models have been tested to predict PMECWT and X-5050 as a function of anthropometric measurements. Finally, it was considered whether the average chest wall thickness could be used instead of the material equivalent chest wall thickness. It was found that the mean chest wall thickness was (27 +/- 5) mm and the mean fat fraction was (25 +/- 8)%. The best and more convenient model for material equivalent chest wall thickness is a linear function of the body mass index. Depending on the energy, the standard errors of estimate for this model range between 3.2-3.4 mm for PMECWT and between 3.2-3.7 mm for X-5050. At 59.5 and 185.7 keV, it was determined, to an excellent approximation, that the fat fraction and consideration of an equivalent material are unnecessary, contrary to the case at 17 keV.

Iodine-131 monitoring in sewage plant outflow	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article							MEDICALLY USED RADIONUCLIDES; SLUDGE	Three different hospital sites (Oxford, Sutton and Guildford) have performed sampling of their local sewage plant outflow to determine levels of radioactivity resulting from iodine-131 patients undergoing radionuclide therapies. It was found that a maximum of 20% of activity discharged from the hospitals was present in the sewage plant final effluent channel. This is significantly below the level predicted by mathematical models in current use.

Advanced spatio-temporal modelling in long-term radiological assessment models-radionuclides in the soil column	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article							COMPARTMENTAL-MODELS	Recent developments in the modelling of key radionuclides in long-timescale assessments of the safety of geological disposal of spent fuel and other radioactive wastes emphasise the influence of the redox conditions of the soil column. Models with higher spatial resolution than typically employed in standard modelling approaches have been shown to capture important features of experimental observations that are not otherwise manifested. Furthermore, models with monthly, rather than annually, averaged parameters and with dynamic transfers between soil and plant have been shown to lead to key differences compared with standard models employing soil-plant concentration ratios. This paper looks at the potential for the inclusion of a higher spatio-temporal resolution in models for long-timescale dose assessments and includes representations of measured plant-root distributions as well as the effects of bioturbation. Focusing here on the distribution and dynamics of radionuclides in the soil column, the effects of different spatial and temporal resolution are compared, together with an investigation of the way in which the hydrology of the soil column is represented. The approach has been successfully incorporated into a practical assessment-level model. Results indicate the potential importance of higher spatio-temporal resolution in modelling soil column dynamics, particularly of weakly sorbing radionuclides in long-timescale assessments featuring sudden transitions between ecosystem types.

In particular, the effective doses to the port workers and members of the population surrounding the port area have been estimated. The study has included different types of measurement and assessment. First, the natural radioactivity of different fertilisers moving through the port has been determined: K-40, Ra-226, Pb-210, Ra-228 and Th-228 concentrations have been analysed using gamma-ray spectrometry, while U-238 and Th-232 concentrations have been determined by ICP-MS. At the same time, a dose rate meter and electret ion chambers were used to measure the external irradiation and the radon concentrations, respectively. Then, air pollutant dispersion models have been applied in order to assess particulate matter concentration in the port site and the surrounding residential areas, and consequently the inhalation doses. Finally, the annual effective doses to workers and local residents have been estimated. The effective doses to workers and the population have been estimated to be 0.9 mSv yr(-1) and 0.07 mu Sv yr(-1), respectively.

Application of PERALS (TM) alpha spectrometry and gamma spectrometry for analysis and investigation of environmental spills at ISL uranium mining projects	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article							OCCURRING RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS; LIQUID SCINTILLATION; RA-226	Radiation protection and environmental monitoring in mining requires effective and reliable radionuclide analysis at all stages of the mine project-prior to mining, during operation and through to remediation and decommissioning. The approach presented in this paper was specially developed for the monitoring of radioactive waste resulting from spills during mining and mineral processing operations and uses a combination of high resolution gamma spectrometry, and PERALS (TM) alpha spectrometry to identify and reliably quantify the activity of the major members of the U-238 decay chain at activities down to 10 mBq g(-1) by direct radionuclide counting and by assessment of the activity of their decay products. This approach has reduced sample preparation and analysis time while providing effective analysis and quantification of naturally occurring radionuclides in environmental samples. It has been successfully applied to several in situ leach (ISL) mining-related projects involving investigations of process material spill impacts and also to routine environmental monitoring.

Effective dose in SMAW and FCAW welding processes using rutile consumables	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article							LIMITS	The shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) and flux cored arc welding (FCAW) processes use covered electrodes and flux cored wire as consumables. Among these consumables, ones containing rutile are the most widely used, and since they have a considerable natural radioactive content, they can be considered as NORM (naturally occurring radioactive material). To calculate the effective dose on workers during their use in a conservative situation, samples of slag and aerosols and particles emitted or deposited during welding were taken and measured by gamma, alpha and beta spectrometry. An analytical method was also developed for estimating the activity concentration of radionuclides in the inhaled air. Rn-222 activity concentration was also assessed. With all these data, internal and external doses were calculated. The results show that external doses are negligible in comparison with internal ones, which do not exceed 1 mSv yr(-1), either in this conservative situation or in any other more favourable one. Radionuclides after Rn in the radioactive natural series are emitted at the same activity concentration to the atmosphere, this being around 17 times higher than that corresponding to radionuclides before Rn. Taking into account these conclusions and the analytical method developed, it can be concluded that one way to assess the activity concentration of natural radionuclides in inhaled air and hence effective doses could be the early gamma-ray spectrometry of aerosols and particles sampled during the welding process.

The legislation sets new activity thresholds for what is within its scope and for what is exempt from the permitting requirements. These thresholds are, for the first time, clearly based on the levels in the Basic Safety Standards Directive; distinguish between NORM industrial activities and practices; and are derived from different dose constraints. There are new exemption provisions for NORM, aqueous liquids and gaseous wastes.

Experimental shielding evaluation of the radiation protection provided by the structurally significant components of residential structures	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article						validated building shielding factor; attenuation coefficient; semi-infinite cloud; contaminant deposition; realistic source term		The human health and environmental effects following a postulated accidental release of radioactive material to the environment have been a public and regulatory concern since the early development of nuclear technology. These postulated releases have been researched extensively to better understand the potential risks for accident mitigation and emergency planning purposes. The objective of this investigation is to provide an updated technical basis for contemporary building shielding factors for the US housing stock. Building shielding factors quantify the protection from ionising radiation provided by a certain building type. Much of the current data used to determine the quality of shielding around nuclear facilities and urban environments is based on simplistic point-kernel calculations for 1950s era suburbia and is no longer applicable to the densely populated urban environments realised today. To analyse a building's radiation shielding properties, the ideal approach would be to subject a variety of building types to various radioactive sources and measure the radiation levels in and around the building. While this is not entirely practicable, this research analyses the shielding effectiveness of ten structurally significant US housing-stock models (walls and roofs) important for shielding against ionising radiation. The experimental data are used to benchmark computational models to calculate the shielding effectiveness of various building configurations under investigation from two types of realistic environmental source terms. Various combinations of these ten shielding models can be used to develop full-scale computational housing-unit models for building shielding factor calculations representing 69.6 million housing units (61.3%) in the United States. Results produced in this investigation provide a comparison between theory and experiment behind building shielding factor methodology.	[Dickson, E. D.; Hamby, D.

Detection of radioactive fragments in patients after radiological or nuclear emergencies using computed tomography and digital radiography	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article							INTRAOCULAR FOREIGN-BODIES; OPERATION-IRAQI-FREEDOM; ANATOMICAL NOISE; SOFT-TISSUE; PARTICLES; QUANTIFICATION; LOCALIZATION; SENSITIVITY; EXPERIENCE; PROTOCOL	A comparison has been carried out between standard-dose computed tomography, non-diagnostic computed tomography and digital radiography with respect to their suitability for detecting radioactive fragments associated with nuclear or radiological events such as debris from radiological dispersal devices. The purpose was to investigate if radiographic imaging is justified for the detection and localisation of radioactive fragments in affected patients. Fragments of uranium (U), copper (Cu), iron (Fe) and volcanic ash with effective diameters ranging from (approximately) 100 to 700 mu m were selected. The fragments were positioned at two different locations on an anatomical torso phantom and images were produced with standard-dose CT, non-diagnostic CT and digital radiography. Capsules with radionuclides of Cs-137, Co-60 and Tc-99m were also positioned in the phantom and the effective doses were estimated for radionuclide exposures as well as for standard-dose CT, non-diagnostic CT and digital radiography. For standard-dose CT and digital radiography, U, Cu and Fe fragments were detected in sizes down to 100-180, 250-300 and 300-400 mu m respectively. For the non-diagnostic CT the results were 180-250 mu m (for U), 300-400 mu m (for Cu) and 400-500 mu m (for Fe). The effective dose from the standard-dose CT, non-diagnostic CT and digital radiography was 5.6, 1.9 and 0.76 mSv. Corresponding doses from Co-137, Co-60 and Tc-99m positioned at the site of fragments were in the range of 0.07-0.1, 0.32-0.45 and 0.08-0.09 mSv per MBq during 24 h. We conclude that, for a number of gamma emitters with activity levels on the order of magnitude of megabecquerel, imaging using ionising radiation can be justified since the effective dose from the radionuclides will exceed the dose from the radiological examination.

J	Jargin, SV				Jargin, Sergei V.			Depleted uranium instead of lead in munitions: the lesser evil	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article						depleted uranium; lead; threshold limit values	HEALTH; EXPOSURE	Uranium has many similarities to lead in its exposure mechanisms, metabolism and target organs. However, lead is more toxic, which is reflected in the threshold limit values. The main potential hazard associated with depleted uranium is inhalation of the aerosols created when a projectile hits an armoured target. A person can be exposed to lead in similar ways. Accidental dangerous exposures can result from contact with both substances. Encountering uranium fragments is of minor significance because of the low penetration depth of alpha particles emitted by uranium: they are unable to penetrate even the superficial keratin layer of human skin. An additional cancer risk attributable to the uranium exposure might be significant only in case of prolonged contact of the contaminant with susceptible tissues. Lead intoxication can be observed in the wounded, in workers manufacturing munitions etc; moreover, lead has been documented to have a negative impact on the intellectual function of children at very low blood concentrations. It is concluded on the basis of the literature overview that replacement of lead by depleted uranium in munitions would be environmentally beneficial or largely insignificant because both lead and uranium are present in the environment.

Chemical toxicity and radiological health detriment associated with the inhalation of various enrichments of uranium	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article						uranium; toxicity; chemical		The occupational risks associated with the chemical toxicity of uranium can be overlooked during the processing, handling and storage of the material, as the radioactivity of the material is often used alone to assess the health consequences of exposure to uranium compounds. This note provides a summary of the current United Kingdom occupational standards for uranium based on radiation dose and/or chemical toxicity with a particular focus on intake via inhalation. A simple model is subsequently presented to allow a comparison to be drawn between the occupational exposure standard for chemical toxicity and radiological dose limit. Using these data a set of suggested limits on occupational exposure to airborne uranium is proposed that indicate where the legal annual radiological dose limit for workers or the Health and Safety Executive occupational exposure standard for chemical toxicity are at risk of being breached.

The staff of a tokamak is exposed to a wide range of neutrons and photons around the tokamak hall. The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is a nuclear fusion engineering project and the most advanced experimental tokamak in the world. From the radiobiological point of view, ITER dose rates assessment is particularly important. The aim of this study is the assessment of the amount of radiation in ITER during its normal operation in a radial direction from the plasma chamber to the tokamak hall. To achieve this goal, the ITER system and its components were simulated by the Monte Carlo method using the MCNPX 2.6.0 code. Furthermore, the equivalent dose rates of some radiosensitive organs of the human body were calculated by using the medical internal radiation dose phantom. Our study is based on the deuterium-tritium plasma burning by 14.1 MeV neutron production and also photon radiation due to neutron activation. As our results show, the total equivalent dose rate on the outside of the bioshield wall of the tokamak hall is about 1 mSv per year, which is less than the annual occupational dose rate limit during the normal operation of ITER. Also, equivalent dose rates of radiosensitive organs have shown that the maximum dose rate belongs to the kidney. The data may help calculate how long the staff can stay in such an environment, before the equivalent dose rates reach the whole-body dose limits.

INFLUENCE OF THE SCINTILLATION CRYSTAL OPTION ON THE DETECTOR RESPONSE OF PET DEVICES	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY & RADIATION PROTECTION			English	Article						positron emission tomography; scintillation crystal; detector response	MEASUREMENT UNCERTAINTY; SCANNERS; RADIATION	Positron emission tomography is a technology that provides unique and exquisite possibilities in functional diagnostics, in the sense that it is the most efficient and most reliable method for obtaining information about biochemical activity and cellular metabolism in the body, by determining exact localization and performing semi-quantitative assessment of the distribution of a radioactive tracer. This paper compares the characteristics of recently introduced lutetium based crystals to those of conventionally used bismuth-ortho-germanate scintillators; both options are used as scintillation detectors within the positron emission tomography systems. Energy resolution and scintillation decay time of lutetium based crystals and bismuth-ortho-germanate crystals was experimentally tested. Main scintillation detector parameters which affect the resulting detector response are considered and analyzed, since they serve as the basis for a positron emission tomography medical image.

ASSESSMENT OF RADIATION EXPOSURE AROUND ABANDONED URANIUM MINING AREA OF STARA PLANINA MT., SERBIA	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY & RADIATION PROTECTION			English	Article						radiological assessment; uranium; thorium; soil; water	GAMMA DOSE-RATE; NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; TERRESTRIAL EXPOSURE; RISK-ASSESSMENT; SURFACE SOILS; CANCER-RISK; VICINITY; RADIONUCLIDES; MONTENEGRO; MINES	The aim of this work was to estimate the health and radiation hazard due to external irradiation from terrestrial radionuclides in the Stara planina Mt. region, which is important because of past uranium mining activities on the mountain. Soil samples were collected inside the flotation processing facilities, their surroundings and more distant locations, i. e. from areas considered certainly affected, potentially affected, and unaffected by former mining and uranium ore processing activities. The radiological and health risk assessments were done by calculating the six main parameters, based on the activity concentration of U-238, Th-232, and K-40 in soil samples as determined by gamma-ray spectrometry. Increased values of the risk parameters were observed only for sites where uranium ore was processed, while the location surrounding these compounds showed values that are usual for this mountain or slightly above them. Calculations of the risk parameters for the background area showed no radiation risk for the local and seasonal population. The presence of U and Th was detected in all water samples from creeks surrounding the facilities, but only in the water from the facility drainage pipe did their concentration exceed the limits given for the uranium content in drinking water. In conclusion, the results obtained in this study fall within the range of values in similar studies conducted worldwide and are below the values which can cause a significant radiation hazard.

The mean specific activity concentrations of the mentioned radionuclides were respectively found to be 83.56 +/- 17.96 Bq/kg, 44.35 +/- 12.65 Bq/kg, 630.89 +/- 173.85 Bq/kg, and 5.37 +/- 4.87 Bq/kg. A good correlation between the activities of Th-232 and U-238 was found. The radiological parameters namely radium equivalent activity, representative level index, external hazard index, internal hazard index, absorbed dose rate, and effective annual outdoor dose rate due to the natural radionuclides were also calculated. The average values of the mentioned parameters were found to be 212.26 +/- 43.93 Bq/kg, 1.55 +/- 0.32 Bq/kg, 0.29 +/- 0.06, 0.69 +/- 0.15, 97.27 +/- 20.03 nGy/h, and 119.37 +/- 24.58 mu Sv/y, respectively. The radiation dose levels at the points of sample collection were also measured by a portable radiation dose rate-meter. The average value of the outdoor dose rate was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.07 mu Sv/h ranging from 0.16 +/- 0.02 mu Sv/h to 0.28 +/- 0.04 mu Sv/h. The distributions of natural radionuclides were found to be normal. The concentration levels of different radionuclides were comparable to the corresponding reported values of the soil of different countries.

THE FREQUENCY OF CHROMOSOMAL ABERRATIONS IN SHEEP FROM THE AREA CONTAMINATED BY DEPLETED URANIUM DURING NATO AIR STRIKES IN 1999	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY & RADIATION PROTECTION			English	Article						depleted uranium; sheep; chromosomal aberration; break and gap; NATO attack in 1999; Bujanovac	INDUCED GENOMIC INSTABILITY; IONIZING-RADIATION; OXIDATIVE STRESS; SOUTHERN SERBIA; TRACE-ELEMENTS; EXPOSURE; BLOOD; MICRONUCLEI; GENOTOXICITY; POPULATIONS	This paper presents the results of cytogenetic studies in sheep from the region of Bujanovac that was contaminated by depleted uranium during the NATO air strikes in 1999. The study was conducted on sheep blood lymphocytes, in order to determine the frequency of chromosomal aberrations and to assess the presence of genetic risk as a result of the possible impact of depleted uranium. Blood samples for lymphocyte cultures were taken at random from the 20 animals of the households in the village of Borovac, near Bujanovac. The animals were chosen because they were pastured, fed, and watered in the NATO bombing area. With the purpose of comparing the results two control groups were cytogenetically analyzed, each consisted of 20 sheep from Zemun and Ova, two northern localities that were not contaminated with depleted uranium. The established structural chromosomal changes were of breaks and gap types, and their frequencies in sheep of all surveyed localities were within the range of basic level values that are commonly found in the sheep lymphocyte cultures analyses. Significant differences are apparent between the values defined in the sheep from Bujanovac compared to those obtained in the sheep from the northern locality (Zemun), probably as a result of breeding of animals in the farm conditions and their being less exposed to the impact of environmental agents. There were neither elevated values of polyploid and aneuploid cells nor significant differences between the sites. According to earlier known data, depleted uranium was below the detection limit of the method applied both in the soil and feed given to cytogenetically analyzed animals. Based on the low-level changes that are in the range of the basic level changes, commonly observed in sheep lymphocytes control cultures, it cannot be said with certainty that it was depleted uranium that caused the changes, or that it is widespread in the region of Bujanovac.

Accordingly, India has taken up development of 9Cr-W-Ta reduced activation ferritic martensitic (RAFM) steel, which is the structural material chosen for TBMs, together with the associated manufacturing technologies required for TBM fabrication. With the objective of developing an India-specific RAFM steel, four heats of RAFM steel with tungsten and tantalum contents varying in the ranges I to 2 wt% and 0.06 to 0.014 wt%, respectively, were melted. The steel was melted through vacuum induction melting and vacuum arc refining routes with strict control over the amounts of elements that induce radioactivity (Mo, Nb, B, Cu, Ni, Al, Co, and Ti) and the elements that promote embrittlement (S, P. As, Sb, Sn, Zr, and O). Extensive characterization of the microstructure and mechanical properties of the steel was carried out. The ductile-to-brittle transition temperature of the steel increased slightly with increasing tungsten and tantalum content. The tensile strength of the steel was found not to change significantly with increasing tungsten content; however, it decreased marginally with increasing tantalum content, with a consequent increase in ductility. The creep rupture strength of the steel at 823 K was found to increase significantly with increasing tungsten content, whereas it decreased with increasing tantalum content. The low-cycle fatigue life of the steel at 823 K was found to increase with increasing tungsten and tantalum content; however, extensive cyclic softening was exhibited when the tungsten content was > 1.4 wt%. RAFM steel containing 1.4 wt% tungsten and 0.06 wt% tantalum was found to have a better combination of strength and toughness and is specified as Indian RAFM (INRAFM) steel. The joining technologies adopted for the fabrication of a TBM are hot isostatic pressing to produce the first wall, followed by gas tungsten arc (GTA), electron beam (EB), laser, and laser hybrid welding for joining the rest of the TBM. Welding techniques for joining RAFM steel have been developed and characterized. The properties of the GTA welds met the full specifications of the requirement and were comparable to the properties of the base metal. This consumable has also been used to carry out hybrid laser welding successfully. A procedure for using EB welding to join plates of thicknesses up to 12 mm has been developed. Impact tests conducted on EB welds showed that the toughness of the weld metal in the as-welded condition is comparable to that of the base metal. A box structure that simulates one of the components of a TBM has been fabricated using EB welding to demonstrate the applicability of the process to component fabrication. Laser welding of 6-mm-thick plates of RAFM steel has also been carried out successfully, and the properties of the weld joints have been found to be satisfactory. This paper discusses the development of INRAFM steel and its properties and the current status of the fabrication technologies being developed for fabrication of the Indian TBM to be tested in ITER.

PROCESS OPTIMIZATION OF Er2O3 COATING BY REACTIVE MAGNETRON SPUTTERING FOR DEMO-RELEVANT BLANKET MODULES	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2ND JOINT IAEA-ITER TECHNICAL MEETING ON ANALYSIS OF ITER MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGIES	DEC 11-13, 2012	Ahmedabad, INDIA			erbia; permeation barrier coating; reactive magnetron sputtering	TRITIUM PERMEATION BARRIER; ERBIUM SESQUIOXIDE ER2O3; OXIDE	India has proposed to develop and test the Lead-Lithium cooled Ceramic Breeder Test Blanket Module (In-LLCB-TBM) in ITER. This concept, unlike some others, may need a high-performance ceramic coating on the inner wall to meet dual requirements such as high insulation to mitigate magnetohydrodynamic effects and a tritium permeation barrier to avoid tritium in the structural material. We deposit Er2O3 coatings using a direct-current magnetron reactive sputter deposition technique. As part of optimizing the coating from the application point of view, we carried out a series of deposition experiments. These included investigating the effects of substrate temperature in the range 165 degrees C to 360 degrees C, the effects of postannealing, and the effects of oxygen-to-argon gas flow ratio, keeping all other process parameters constant. Primarily, a densely packed film is required to grow in the most stable cubic crystal structure, with very high resistivity, in the range of gigaohm-centimeters to teraohm-centimeters. The results indicate that erbia films of thicknesses in the range 270 to 1000 nm are formed in amorphous, monoclinic, and cubic phases, where the cubic phase content is enhanced in a narrow window of the flow ratio at 360 degrees C. Both crystalline phases seem to grow in a preferred crystalline direction. Post-vacuum-annealing at 500 degrees C for 2 h largely transforms the monoclinic phase into the cubic phase.	[Rayjada, P.

SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF Li4SiO4 CERAMICS FROM RICE HUSK ASH BY A SOLUTION-COMBUSTION METHOD	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2ND JOINT IAEA-ITER TECHNICAL MEETING ON ANALYSIS OF ITER MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGIES	DEC 11-13, 2012	Ahmedabad, INDIA			lithium orthosilicate; tritium breeder; rice husk ash	LITHIUM SILICATES; BREEDER MATERIALS; POWDERS; BLANKET	Phase-pure lithium orthosilicate (Li4SiO4) was prepared by a solution-combustion technique using rice husk ash as a silica source. We found that by controlling the citrate-to-metal (C/M) ratio of the solution and the calcination temperature of the as-burnt powder, phase purity can be achieved. The particle size of the Li4SiO4 powder (prepared at a C/M ratio of 1.4) was found to be 100 to 200 nm with a low surface area (1.83 m(2)/g). It was found that Li4SiO4 powder can be sintered at a temperature as low as 900 degrees C with a density of similar to 83% of the theoretical density. Phase stability in the sintered sample was studied. Attempts were made to minimize lithium loss from the sintered specimens. The solution-combustion-derived Li4SiO4 fractured pellets showed narrow pore size distributions with pore diameters in the range 0.2 to 10 mu m. Thermal diffusivity was measured using a laser flash method. Thermal conductivity values depend on the density of the sample. An impedance spectroscopy method has been used to characterize the electrical properties of the sintered sample as tritium diffusion is related to Li+ ion conductivity in Li4SiO4.

It will be used as the tritium-breeder material for the Indian lead-lithium-cooled ceramic breeder concept of the TBM to be tested in ITER. Thermal conductivity is one of the most important parameters in the design of TBMs using ceramic materials. The design of breeder blankets is strongly affected by the low values of the thermal conductivity and density of ceramic breeder pebble beds. A significant increase in both quantities would enhance thermal performance and lead to an increased tritium-breeding ratio. Thermal transport properties of Li2TiO3 were measured using the laser flash method, which determines the thermal diffusivity from the transient temperature rise measured at one side of a pellet with laser pulse heating at the other side. The thermal conductivity of Li2TiO3 pellets was then estimated from the experimentally obtained thermal diffusivity values. Finite element analysis using ANSYS software was performed to simulate the transient thermal measurements, and the results were compared with those obtained by the laser flash method. The experimental and simulation results were found to be in good agreement. The experimental details and ANSYS simulation are presented in this paper.

The major issues involved in the production of this eutectic alloy include (a) effective mixing, (b) avoiding the stratification of Pb and Li, (c) minimizing the formation of intermetallic compounds by controlling the temperature, and (d) avoiding the formation of oxides and nitrides of Pb and Li in the cast. In this regard, an attempt has been made to mix lead and lithium using a magnetohydrodynamic stirring technique by the application of a rotating magnetic field. A precalculated amount of liquid lithium has been injected into a circulating lead melt at high pressure and temperature. The mixture has been heated at a controlled temperature and stirred continuously through magnetic induction to produce Pb-Li eutectic. Characterization of the alloy through scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectrometry, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, and density measurement techniques indicates the formation of eutectic composition at the center of the cast, though higher lead concentrations are obtained toward the bottom.

Lithium metatitanate (Li2TiO3) is being considered as a promising tritium breeding material for thermonuclear fusion reactors because of its reasonable lithium atom density, prominent tritium release rate at low temperatures, low activation characteristics, low thermal expansion coefficient, high thermal conductivity, etc. Li2TiO3 will be used in the Indian Lead-Lithium-Cooled Ceramic Breeder concept to be tested in ITER. Li2TiO3 powder has been synthesized by the solution-combustion technique using a less expensive precursor of titanium, i.e., titanium dioxide (TiO2), at Institute for Plasma Research. Titanium oxynitrate [TiO(NO3)(2)] and lithium carbonate (Li2TiO3) with citric acid fuel are used as the raw materials. The combustion reaction was carried out at citrate-to-metal ratios of 0.8 to 1.5, as well as for various pH values ranging from 1 to 5. Citric acid was used as a fuel material for the reaction. Calcination of the powder was carried out at 600 degrees C. The powders were characterized for phase purity, grain size, and surface area using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analyzer. Finally, Li2TiO3 pebbles were prepared by extrusion followed by spheronization with a diameter range from 1 to 1.5 mm. The details of the powder systemization, pebble formation, and their various characterizations are discussed in this paper.

The influences of different cone mesh opening diameters (1.5, 1.0, and 0.5 mm) and spherodization speed were investigated to obtain small (0.5- to 1.5-mm) pebbles with small variations in size. It was found that Li2TiO3 could be sintered at low temperature (900 degrees C for 6 h) with appreciable density (89%) and small grain size (1 to 3 mu m) without significant closed porosity. The sphericity, pore size distribution, grain size, and crushing load strength of the sintered pebbles were also characterized. Their values were found to conform with the desired properties for use as a solid breeder.	[Sahu, B.

Analysis of processes in RBMK-1500 fuel rods during the operation, short and intermediate term storage	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article								Recently the reactors of both units of Ignalina NPP in Lithuania were shutdown for decommissioning (in 2004 and 2009). According to the design, the spent fuel should be returned for reprocessing to Russia. However, up to now, all assemblies of spent fuel are still stored in the spent fuel pools and in the dry storage facility on-site of the Ignalina NPP. Thus, the safety justification for short and intermediate term spent fuel assemblies storage in Ignalina NPP is very important. The most important barrier, preventing release of radioactivity from the fuel matrix to the environment is the fuel rod cladding. The condition (integrity) of cladding at the end of intermediate storage of spent fuel assemblies may be evaluated by simulating processes in fuel rods during the whole "life cycle" of the fuel assembly: beginning from the first loading into the reactor core, until the end of dry intermediate storage in special casks. This paper presents the modelling of processes in fuel rods during normal operation of fuel assemblies in reactor, short term wet storage in spent fuel pool and intermediate storage in dry cask. The analysis was performed using FEMAXI-6 integral code for the analysis of processes in fuel rod. The behaviour of thermal (pressure inside fuel rod, temperatures of fuel pellets and cladding, etc.) and mechanical (change of the gap between pellets and cladding, stresses and plastic deformation in fuel pellets and cladding, etc.) parameters were calculated. The analysis performed demonstrates the possibility to describe the state of the, fuel rods after normal operation and short and intermediate term fuel storage.

Radiotracers in performance evaluation of nuclear grade resins Amberlite IRN-78 and Purolite NRW-8000	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article							ANION-EXCHANGE RESINS; ION-EXCHANGE; DISTRIBUTION COEFFICIENT; TRACER TECHNIQUE; WATER; DEPENDENCE; STABILITY; KINETICS	The present paper deals with evaluation of organic base nuclear grade anion exchange resins Amberlite IRN-78 and Purolite NRW-8000 by application of radioactive tracer isotopes I-131 and Br-82. The evaluation was made on the basis of their performance in iodide and bromide ion-isotopic exchange reactions carried out under different experimental conditions like temperature and ionic concentration. It was observed that during iodide ion-isotopic exchange reaction at a constant temperature of 30.0 degrees C, as the concentration of labeled iodide ion solution increases from 0.001 mol/L to 0.004 mol/L, the percentage of iodide ions exchanged increases from 70.10 % to 77.10 % for Amberlite IRN-78, which was higher than an increase of 63.90 % to 71.00 % as obtained for Purolite NRW-8000 resins. Also at a constant temperature of 30.0 degrees C, using 1.000 g of ion exchange resins and 0.001 mol/L labeled iodide ion solution, the values of specific reaction rate (min(-1)), amount of iodide ion exchanged (mmol), initial rate of iodide ion exchange (mmol/min) and log K-d were calculated to be 0.280, 0.175, 0.049 and 11.4 respectively for Amberlite IRN-78 resin, which was higher than the values of 0.258, 0.160, 0.041 and 10.6 respectively as that obtained by using Purolite NRW-8000 resins. The identical trend was observed for the two resins during bromide ion-isotopic exchange reaction. The results of present investigation also indicate that during the two ion-isotopic exchange reactions, for both the resins, there exists a strong positive linear correlation between amount of ions exchanged and concentration of ionic solution; and strong negative correlation between amount of ions exchanged and temperature of exchanging medium. The overall results indicate that under identical experimental conditions, Amberlite IRN-78 resins show superior performance over Purolite NRW-8000 resins.

The production of Pu238-242(n,gamma)Pu239-243 fissionable fluids in a fusion-fission hybrid reactor	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article							3-DIMENSIONAL NEUTRONIC CALCULATIONS; POWER DENSITY CONCEPTS; BREEDER APEX REACTOR; STRUCTURAL MATERIAL; RADIATION-DAMAGE; TECHNOLOGY	In this study, the effect of spent fuel grade plutonium content on Pu259-243 was investigated in a designed hybrid reactor system. In this system, the fluids were composed of a molten salt, heavy metal mixture with increased mole fractions 99-95% Li20Sn80-1-5% SFG-Pu, 99-95% Li20Sn80-1-5% SFG-PuF4, 99-95% Li20Sn80-1-5% SFG-PuO2. Beryllium (Be) is a neutron multiplier by (n,2n) reactions. Thence, a Be zone of 3 cm thickness was used in order to contribute to fissile fuel breeding between the liquid first wall and a 9Cr2WVTa ferritic steel blanket which is used as structural material. The production of Pu238-242(n,gamma)Pu239-243 was calculated in liquid first wall, blanket and shielding zones. Three-dimensional nucleonic calculations were performed by using the most recent version MCNPX-2.7.0 Monte Carlo code and nuclear data library ENDF/B-VII.0.

Assessment of the radiological health damage costs of the Yenikoy and Kemerkoy lignite-fired power plants in Mugla	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article								The health impacts and corresponding damage costs of radioactive emissions of Yenikoy and Kemerkoy lignite-fired power plants in Mug la have been assessed by using the simplified impact pathway approach. Radiation dose and risk calculations have been carried out by the code CAP88-PC around the power plants. Specific isotopes, Ra-226, Th-232, K-40 and U-238 in the flying ash samples are considered as radioactive sources. The estimated total collective doses around Yenikoy and Kemerkoy power plants are 3.15 x 10(-4) man Sv/year and 3.77 x 10(-4) man Sv/year. Health effects and the corresponding damage costs around the power plants due to radioactive emissions from the power plants are negligible.	[Kone, A.

A DUAL SYSTEM FOR MONITORING THE POSITIONS OF MULTIPLE RADIOACTIVE TRACER PEBBLES IN SCALED PEBBLE BED REACTORS	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						pebble bed reactors; pebble flow measurement	MONTE-CARLO-SIMULATION; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATION; RESPONSE FUNCTIONS; FLOW	A dual measurement system for monitoring the simultaneous positions of multiple radioactive tracer pebbles in scaled pebble bed reactors (PBRs) has been developed and benchmarked to the prototype stage. The first system (the collimated system) is an updated version of a previously developed system that is now a completely automatic system that uses three collimated directionally variable NaI detectors that are programed to continuously search for a maximum counting rate from a single radioactive pebble. This system can be used by itself when a single radioactive tracer pebble is of interest and the pebble is relatively slow moving. In the present case, its primal), use is to provide an independent measurement of the position of a stationary tracer pebble that is used to provide a point for calibration of the second system. The second system (the uncollimated system) is a modified version of a multiple uncollimated NaI detector system commonly called CARPT. The modified version involves those changes necessary to allow for use of the entire gamma-ray spectra for the inverse problem instead of only the gamma-ray fill energy peaks. This allows one to use multiple radioisotopes each in a different tracer pebble so that up to ten individual tracer pebbles can be followed simultaneously with the best possible accuracy. The inverse problem is treated with the Monte Carlo library least-squares approach in which Monte Carlo generated library spectra for each radioisotope are made available for a complete range of reference positions within the scaled PBR. Then, any unknown total gamma-ray spectra can be analyzed in an iterative fashion with the radioisotope library spectra to yield the position of all the radioisotope tracer pebbles. The scaled PBR used was a 30-cm-high and 30-cm-diam circular cylindrical section on the top and a cone with a 25-deg angle on the bottom. The pebbles are 1.2-cm glass marbles. Results have been obtained with both single tracer radioisotope marbles and multiple tracer radioisotope marbles, simultaneously.

The sodium void reactivity, which is one of the major core safety parameters, is considerably influenced by TRU fuel compositions. The criteria assigned to the JSFR core include a void reactivity effect limited to similar to 6 $; therefore, designing a core with reduced sodium void reactivity will offer a greater margin for the core to host TRU fuel. To this end, a new core concept called BUMPY is proposed. This homogeneous core exhibits a low sodium void reactivity, due to partial-length fuels with an upper sodium plenum interspersed within the core, among other standard fuel assemblies. This core configuration enhances the upward and lateral neutron leakage from the core fuel region toward the sodium plenum when voiding to reduce void reactivity. The BUMPY core is applied to the 750-MW(electric) JSFR core design. The core can meet the design target by adjusting the loading fraction of the partial-length fuels and the height of the step in fuel lengths. The calculated void reactivity of the selected BUMPY core is 2.5 $ (25% loading fraction, 30-cm step height), which is considerably reduced from the 5.3 $ value of the reference core. This allows the BUMPY core to accommodate 5% to 9% more minor actinides in the core compared to the reference core.

A comparison was conducted of the energy resolution and detection efficiency of these scintillator detectors for different sizes of detectors. The results of this study are consistent with the observation that for each size detector, LaBr3:Ce offers better resolution than either a CeBr3 or NaI:Tl detector of the same size. In addition, CeBr3 and LaBr3:Ce detectors could resolve some closely spaced peaks in the spectra of several radioisotopes that NaI:Tl could not. As the detector size increased, all three detector materials exhibited higher efficiency, albeit with slightly reduced resolution. Significantly, the very low intrinsic activity of CeBr3 is also demonstrated in this study, which, when combined with energy resolution characteristics for a range of detector sizes, could lead to an improved ability to detect special nuclear materials compared to the other detectors.

Generic investigations of RBMK-1500 SNF disposal options in Lithuania were initiated. This paper presents insights on RBMK-1500 SNF disposal in crystalline rocks gained during participation in the International Atomic Energy Agency Coordinated Research Project "The Use of Numerical Models in Support of Site Characterization and Performance Assessment Studies for Geological Repositories," as well as in the Lithuanian Science Development Program. The research was focused on the analysis of disposal behavior of different SNF types under generic geological conditions and for a one-canister defect scenario with two different corrosion rates. A comparison of peak fluxes from the near field for Lithuanian RBMK-1500 and Swedish boiling water reactor SNF revealed differences that are not directly proportional to the differences in SNF inventory.

Sensitivity Analysis and Data Assimilation in a Subcritical Plutonium Metal Benchmark	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							CODE	This work presents the application of first-order adjoint sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification, and data assimilation to a subcritical plutonium benchmark experiment using a modified version of the discrete ordinates radiation transport code Denovo. Previous Monte Carlo simulations of this benchmark saw a consistent overprediction of the mean and variance of the measured neutron multiplicity distribution. It was observed that a small scalar reduction in the value of the Pu-239-induced fission neutron multiplicity was capable of significantly reducing the discrepancies. This work extends those results by computing first-order sensitivities to each nuclide, reaction type, energy, and material region in the benchmark. The sensitivities are then used in a data assimilation methodology to simultaneously calibrate all responses and multigroup nuclear data. The resulting best-estimate values for the energy group differential multiplicity (v) over bar (E-g) are 1 sigma to 2 sigma less than the nominal values found in ENDF/B-VII for energies less than similar to 1.5 MeV.

As for solid UO2, the lattice parameter, density, and enthalpy obtained by MD simulations were in good agreement with existing experimental data and previous theoretical predictions. The calculated thermal conductivities matched the experiment results at the midtemperature range but were underestimated at very low and very high temperatures. The calculation results of mean square displacement represented the stability of uranium at all temperatures and the high mobility of oxygen toward 3000 K. By fitting the diffusivity constant of oxygen with the Vogel-FulcherTamman law, we noticed a secondary phase transition near 2006.4 K, which can be identified as a "strong'' to "fragile'' supercooled liquid or glass phase transition in UO2. By fitting the oxygen diffusion constant with the Arrhenius equation, activation energies of 2.0 and 2.7 eV that we obtained were fairly close to the recommended values of 2.3 to 2.6 eV.

The results were compared with the reported experimental data as well as the theoretical calculations based on the TALYS 1.4 code. The present results in the energy region from the threshold energy to 45 MeV are in general good agreement with the other experimental data and calculated results. The present experimental results will play an important role in enrichment of the literature data base for proton-induced reactions on natural hafnium leading to various applications.

Reconstruction of the Eastern Urals Radioactive Track using the Prolog Software	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The PROLOG software is used to reconstruct the radioactive track formed during the 1957 accident at the Industrial Association Mayak. Using the PROLOG model of a fictitious source and varying the disperse composition of the emissions, satisfactory agreement was obtained between the measured and computed values along the axis of the track and the geometric characteristics of the fallout regions on the surface. However, the discrepancy between the measured and computed dose rates at the populated points closest to the accident site reaches a factor of 1000. A hypothesis is advanced concerning the reason for the discrepancy between the results.	[Bogatov, S. A.; Kiselev, A. A.; Krylov, A.

Evaluation of the Radioecological Safety of a Uranium Deposit for Biota	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article							IMPACT	A comparative analysis is made of the irradiation dose for man and organisms in natural communities along different pathways for exposure to radionuclides emerging from deep and surface uranium deposits onto the soil surface. It is determined that for situations where radionuclides in uranium chains are in equilibrium the largest ratio of the dose for biota and man above surface uranium deposits (together from the U-238 and U-235 chain radionuclides) is approximately 47 for soil bacteria and 480 for the U-235 chain. The irradiation dose for trees is 2.5 times smaller than for man. The dose ratio neglecting the contribution from radon inhalation for animals and man is approximately 4.8. When radionuclides emerge at the surface, the ratio of the irradiation dose for soil organisms and plants to the irradiation dose for man is 2-3 times higher during the initial period than during the equilibrium period. The opposite trend with increasing dose ratio is observed for terrestrial animals.	[Spirin, E. V.; Aleksakhin, R.

The product of interaction between PuO3 center dot 0.8H(2)O and XeF2 in CCl4 and CHCl3 was of the same chemical form for both cases and identical with the form of the product of volatility of Pu out of these organic solutions. The electronic absorbance spectra of these products in CCl4 and CHCl3 were fairly similar to the ones for OsO4 and RuO4. The band of absorption in these spectra with the maximum at 332 nm corresponds to the charge transfer of metal-ligand type [pi(O)-> Pu], as the value of molar extinction coefficient.. was found to be higher than 2 x 10(3) L/mole cm. A satisfactory agreement between the energies for the transitions of PuO4 molecule designed by X-alpha-SW method and experimental data was observed. A similar accordance was observed for the designed vibration frequency (DFT-method) with the one found as result of analysis of the vibration structure of the experimental spectra.	[Nikonov, M.
