The influence of many factors, including carrier gas, chamber size, wall materials and gas pressure, has been evaluated in the simulations. It is found that 13 rays emitted by tritium deposit much more energy into chambers flowing through with argon than with deuterium in them, as much as 2.7 times higher at pressure 100 Pa. As chamber size gets smaller, energy deposition decreases sharply. For an ionization chamber of 1 mL, beta rays deposit less than 1% of their energy at pressure 100 Pa and only 84% even if gas pressure is as high as 100 kPa. It also indicates that gold plated ionization chamber results in the highest deposition ratio while aluminum one leads to the lowest. In addition, simulations were validated by comparison with experimental data Results show that simulations agree well with experimental data. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Characterization of a mid-sized Li foil multi-wire proportional counter neutron detector	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Helium-3 replacement; Neutron detector; Multi-wire proportional counter; Li foil		A 550 cm(2) thermal neutron detector was constructed with five parallel sheets of 75 mu m thick Li-6 foil (95% enrichment) spaced 1.63 cm apart. Anode wire banks containing a plurality of anode wires were strung on both sides of each foil, six banks in total. The chamber was backfilled with 0-10 proportional gas and over-pressured to 1.1, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.8 atm (111, 151, 202, and 284 kPa). The design was tailored to allow the products from the Li-6(n,t)He-4 reaction to escape both sides of the Li foil simultaneously, thereby, allowing for concurrent measurement in the proportional gas. The measured intrinsic thermal neutron detection efficiency of the detector with normal incident thermal neutrons to the foil sheets was 53.8 +/- 0.20%. When the detector was angled (55 degrees from normal) such that a 0.5 cm diameter thermal neutron beam intersected all of the foil layers, the intrinsic thermal neutron detection efficiency increased to 58.6 +/- 0.21%. A Cf-252 neutron source positioned at a distance of 2.0 m yielded an absolute neutron detection efficiency of 0.73 cps ng(-1). The gamma-ray rejection ratio (GRR) was 7.67 x 10(-9) as measured from a Co-66 source for an exposure rate of 40 mR hr(-1). Theoretical pulse-height spectra obtained with MCNP6 agreed well with experimental data and allowed pulse-height spectra and discriminator settings to be energy-calibrated. These results demonstrate the potential for the Li foil multi-wire proportional counter (MWPC) as a viable He-3 neutron detector replacement. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Sufficient removal of decay heat is necessary not to damage fuel cladding that functions as a radioactive materials barrier. The experimental design parameters were derived in the half-scale model for the assessment of the design analysis methodology including a CFD tool. The scaling methodology was developed to design the half-scale model of the concrete cask in the spent fuel dry storage through scaling analysis. As one of the most important scaling laws, the requirement of similarity was selected for the temperature rise between the inlet and the exit in the air path. Based on the natural circulation in the channel, the scaling law was derived for total canister power maintaining the similarity of the temperature rise. Then, the temperature calculation and the flow analysis were performed in concrete cask facilities for the prototype and the half scale model using Computational Fluid Dynamics code. Through the CFD simulations, the similarity of the temperature rise was demonstrated well between the inlet and the exit, and the exit temperature was well maintained between the prototype and the half scale model. Also the scaling ratios of air mass flow rate and exit velocity obtained by the scaling analysis were in good agreement with those predicted by CFD analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Predicting critical flow velocity leading to laminate plate collapse - Cylindrical plates	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							FLAT PLATES; INDUCED DEFLECTIONS; FUEL ASSEMBLIES; INSTABILITY	A new prototypic fuel is presently being developed to support the conversion of the U.S. high performance research reactors (HPRRs). This fuel material is a uranium molybdenum alloy and is clad in aluminum. In order to optimize neutron efficiency and reactor performance characteristics the U.S. HPRR core geometry has been designed to accommodate plate type fuel geometry. The relatively thin plate-type geometry provides susceptibility for mechanical failure under the extreme hydraulic loadings that the fuel is exposed to in-pile. An analytical model has been developed and is described in detail which supports the development efforts of the heterogeneous prototypic fuel, and advances the science of hydro-mechanics. This study investigates a single method for determining the 'critical flow velocity' for a laminate cylindrical plate. The objective is accomplished by incorporating a flexural rigidity term into the formulation of critical flow velocity originally derived by Donald R. Miller, and employing super position method to determine the rigidity term. The final outcome of this study results in the development of a single equation for each of three different edge boundary conditions which reliably and comprehensively predicts the onset of plate collapse. Select test cases are performed on this new model and compared against existing models. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Modeling RIA benchmark cases with FRAPTRAN and SCANAIR: A comparative exercise	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							COOLANT HEAT-TRANSFER; BEHAVIOR; PROGRAM; UO2	The need for defining new RIA safety criteria has demonstrated the importance of performing a rigorous assessment of the transient codes capabilities. The present work is a comparative exercise devoted to identify the origin of the key deviations found between the predictions of FRAPTRAN-1.4 and SCANAIR-7.1 codes. To do so, the results of the calculations submitted by CIEMAT to the OECD/NEA RIA benchmark (CIP0-1, CIP3-1, VA-1 and VA-3 experiments) have been exploited. The advantage of these simulations is that the initial rodlet characterization, the transient power and the user assumptions were defined similarly in the two codes, which is essential to perform a consistent comparison. The comparative assessment has led to relevant insights about the codes performances. As for differences reported in the CIPO-1 clad temperatures, the heat transfer modeling across the oxide layer has been found to be mainly responsible. Likewise, the estimation of the gap closure time is directly related to the systematically higher clad hoop deformations predicted by FRAPTRAN-1.4. The differences between FRAPTRAN-1.4 and SCANAIR-7.1 fission gas release predictions reflect the different strategies adopted by the codes to model the complex processes involved in gas release during the transient.

An induction heating method using a cold crucible was implemented for melting of the UO2-ZrO2-Zr-Fe mixture. Before the main test, three preliminary tests have been performed to enhance the experimental techniques using the real core material. One main test of the COSMOS has been performed to evaluate the corium pool configuration in the lower plenum of the reactor vessel for the TLFW (Total Loss of Feed Water) sequence of the APR (Advanced Power Reactor) 1400 under the IVR-ERVC (In-Vessel corium Retention through External Reactor Vessel Cooling). A post-test examination of cutting, EPMA, and XRD for the solidified corium pool ingot in the main test has been performed to investigate the layer inversion. From the three preliminary tests, melting techniques of the real core material using a cold crucible were successfully developed. The metallurgical inspection results on the chemical information coincide with the visual observation on the centerline cut ingot in that the upper part is metal and the lower lump is an oxidic mixture with some metal clods in the main test. This means the possibility of layer inversion of the heavy metallic material in the corium pool. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Mohamed, NMA				Mohamed, Nader M. A.			Direct reuse of spent nuclear fuel	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							WATER-REACTORS; REACTIVITY; REFLECTOR	In this paper we proposed a new design for the PWR fuel assembly for direct use of the PWR spent fuel without processing. The PWR spent fuel will be transferred directly (after a certain cooling time) to CANDU reactors which preferably built in the same site to avoid the problem of transportations. The proposed assembly has four zircaloy-4 tubes contains a number of CANDU fuel bundles (7 or 8 bundles per tube) stacked end to end. Each tube has the same inner diameter of that of CANDU pressure tube. The spaces between the tubes contain low enriched UO2 fuel rods and guide tubes. MCNPX code is used for the simulation and calculation of the burnup of the proposed assembly. The bundles after the discharge from the PWR with their materials inventories are burned in a CANDU cell after a certain decay time. The results were compared with reference results and the impact of this new design on the uranium utilization improvement and on the proliferation resistance of plutonium is discussed. The effect of this new design on the power peaking, moderator temperature coefficient of reactivity and CANDU coolant void reactivity are discussed as well. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Chen, D; Zhao, X; Li, FZ				Chen, Ding; Zhao, Xuan; Li, Fuzhi			Treatment of low level radioactive wastewater by means of NF process	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							MEMBRANE PROCESSES; NANOFILTRATION; PURIFICATION; PRECIPITATION; COMPLEXATION; REMOVAL	Membrane technology has been proved as an effective technology in the treatment of low level radioactive wastewaters (LLRWs). As 'loose reverse osmosis', nanofiltration can be integrated with RO and offers the high permeate flux at low pressure without obvious loss of decontamination efficiency. In the paper, three kinds of commercially available NF membrane materials were investigated by lab-scale experiment with respect to the nuclide rejection. The results demonstrate the efficient elimination. The membrane flux can be improved by the elevation of temperature and cross-flow velocity within the ranges of 20-30 degrees C and 0.4-1.0 ms(-1). The radiation resistance test demonstrates no obvious loss of flux and nuclide rejection after a long term operation in the radioactive circumstance. A brief comparison of LLRWs treatment methods shows that NF can perform the pre-treatment of RO and optimize the entire membrane system with high flux and low pressure. In the paper, decontamination factor and flux values of the tested membranes at different operation condition are summarized as the reference for membrane selection and system design.

J	Merzlyakov, A; Ignatiev, V; Abalin, S				Merzlyakov, Alexander; Ignatiev, Victor; Abalin, Sergei			Viscosity of LiF-NaF-KF eutectic and effect of cerium trifluoride and uranium tetrafluoride additions	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								Kinematic viscosity of the 46.5LiF-11.5NaF-42KF eutectic (mol%) has been measured in the temperature range 727-1144K by the method of torsional oscillations damping of a cylinder with the liquid under study. Found that the kinematic viscosity of this eutectic has some deviations from the exponential law, that may be explained by the existence of clusters in the melt. The volume fraction of the clusters in the eutectic as a function of its temperature was estimated. The kinematic viscosity of the 46.5LiF-11.5NaF-42KF eutectic (in mol%) with additions of (1) 5 and 10 mol% CeF3 as well as (2) 20 mol% UF4 and 10 mol% CeF3 was also measured. It is experimentally proved that the addition of 5 mol% CeF3 significantly reduces the viscosity at low temperatures and slightly increases it - at high temperatures. Reduction of viscosity at low temperatures can be explained by the fact that the molecules of CeF3 destroy clusters. Additions of 20 mol% UF4 also decreased kinematic viscosity of the molten salt mixture compared to pure 46.5LiF-11.5NaF-42KF eutectic (in mol%). Note, that all additions used significantly increased the liquidus temperature of the molten salt mixture. Particularly, additions of 20 mol% UF4 without and with 10 mol% CeF3 increased the liquidus temperature up to 923 and 1023 K, respectively. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	You, WS; Hong, SG				You, Wu Seung; Hong, Ser Gi			A neutronic study on advanced sodium cooled fast reactor cores with thorium blankets for effective burning of transuranic nuclides	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							VOID WORTH; PHYSICS	In this paper, new design concepts of sodium cooled fast reactor (SFR) cores having thorium blanket are suggested for pursuing effective burning of TRU (transuranics) nuclides from LWR spent fuels and their neutronic performances are analyzed. Several core configurations having different arrangements of thorium blankets are explored to improve the core performances and safety-related parameters including sodium void worth which is one of main concerns on safety of SFR cores. Specifically, axial and radial thorium blankets are considered for two type cores. The first one is the typical annular type cores having two different fuel regions where axial thorium blankets are placed in the axially central regions while the second one is the single fuel region cores having central non-fuel region where the axial blanket and radial blankets are considered. Also, the effects of the recycling options and fuel management schemes of the used thorium blanket on the core performances are analyzed. The core performance analyses show that thorium blankets with no recycling option and multi-batch fuel management schemes are very effective to improve the core performances including burnup reactivity swing, sodium void worth and TRU consumption rate.

The core design of ALFRED, a demonstrator for the European lead-cooled reactors	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								The European Union has recently co-funded the LEADER (Lead-cooled European Advanced DEmonstration Reactor) project, in the frame of which the preliminary designs of an industrial size lead-cooled reactor (1500 MWth) and of its demonstrator reactor (300 MWth) were developed. The latter is called ALFRED (Advanced Lead-cooled Fast Reactor European Demonstrator) and its core, as designed and characterized in the project, is presented here. The core parameters have been fixed in a comprehensive approach taking into account the main technological constraints and goals of the system from the very beginning: the limiting temperature of the clad and of the fuel, the Pu enrichment, the achievement of a burn-up of 100 GWd/t, the respect of the integrity of the system even in design extension conditions (DEC). After the general core design has been fixed, it has been characterized from the neutronic point of view by two independent codes (MCNPX and ERANOS), whose results are compared. The power deposition and the reactivity coefficient calculations have been used respectively as input for the thermal-hydraulic analysis (TRACE, CFD and ANTED codes) and for some preliminary transient calculations (RELAP, CATHARE and SIM-LFR codes). The results of the lead activation analysis are also presented (FISPACT code). Some issues of the core design are to be reviewed and improved, uncertainties are still to be evaluated, but the verifications performed so far confirm the promising safety features of the lead-cooled fast reactors.

Oxidation effect on steel corrosion and thermal loads during corium melt in-vessel retention	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								During a severe accident with core meltdown, the in-vessel molten core retention is challenged by the vessel steel ablation due to thermal and physicochemical interaction of melt with steel. In accidents with oxidizing atmosphere above the melt surface, a low melting point UO2+x-ZrO2-FeOy corium pool can form. In this case ablation of the RPV steel interacting with the molten corium is a corrosion process. Experiments carried out within the International Scientific and Technology Center's (ISTC) METCOR Project have shown that the corrosion rate can vary and depends on both surface temperature of the RPV steel and oxygen potential of the melt. If the oxygen potential is low, the corrosion rate is controlled by the solid phase diffusion of Fe ions in the corrosion layer. At high oxygen potential and steel surface layer temperature of 1050 degrees C and higher, the corrosion rate intensifies because of corrosion layer liquefaction and liquid phase diffusion of Fe ions. The paper analyzes conditions under which corrosion intensification occurs and can impact on in-vessel melt retention (IVR). (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Granovsky, V.

Selection and evaluation of potential burnable absorbers incorporated into modified TRISO particles	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							QUADRISO PARTICLES; FUEL; REACTIVITY; PLUTONIUM; REACTOR; SCIENCE; POISON; CORE	The quadruple isotropic (QUADRISO) particle concept modifies tri-structural-isotropic (TRISO) particles to add a layer of burnable absorber next to the fuel kernel. Previous studies have evaluated QUADRISO fuel particle designs for the transmutation of neptunium and plutonium, as a modification to the plutonium-thorium fuel cycle, and for excess reactivity management. This study screens the available nuclear isotope database to identify potential burnable absorbers for incorporation into modified TRISO fuel particles in a representative Very High-Temperature Reactor (VHTR). Based on this screening, eleven potential burnable absorbers are tested as QUADRISO burnable absorber layers, in either oxide or carbide forms. The addition of a burnable absorber layer to the TRISO fuel resulted in an increase in reactor operational lifetime in all cases considered in the present work when compared to a reactor with the same excess reactivity without burnable absorbers. The B4C, CdO and Gd2O3 cases resulted in the greatest operational lifetime, for the same initial excess reactivity, and the addition of these burnable absorbers to TRISO fuel particles decreased the magnitude of the excess reactivity change over the reactor lifetime when compared to the unmodified TRISO case. Thermal cross-section effects in QUADRISO particles generally result in excess reactivity decreasing with increasing temperature. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, solid-liquid system of eutectic interaction was developed. Mass diffusion theory was used for mass transfer between particles. Binary phase diagram was used for developing criteria of transforming into liquid/eutectic particle. THERMOCALC with NUCL10 dataset was utilized to obtain binary phase diagram. Based on the developed MPS model, the TREAT experiments were analyzed. For penetration rates of molten uranium into steel test section, the two-dimensional MPS simulations predicted agreeable values with the experiments for temperature above 1233 and 1187 degrees C for Armco iron and SS304, respectively. As for SS430, MPS simulation predicted agreeable result at 1244 degrees C. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kim, T; Dho, H; Baeg, CY; Lee, GU				Kim, Taeman; Dho, Hoseog; Baeg, Chang-Yeal; Lee, Gang-uk			Preliminary safety analysis of criticality for dual-purpose metal cask under dry storage conditions in South Korea	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								A dual-purpose metal cask is under development led by Korea Radioactive Waste Agency (KORAD) in Korea, for the dry interim storage and long-distance transportation. This cask comprises a main body made of carbon steel and a stainless steel Dry Shielded Canister (DSC), with stainless steel baskets inside to contain spent fuel assemblies. In this study, nuclear criticality safety analysis was conducted as a part of safety assessment of the metal cask. Analysis to show criticality safety in accordance with regulatory requirements of PWR spent fuel storage was carried out. 10CFR72.124 "Criteria for nuclear criticality safety" and the Regulatory Guide of the American Nuclear Society, ANSI/ANS-57.9 "Design Criteria for an Independent Spent Fuel" and US NRC's "Standard Review Plan for Spent Fuel Dry Storage Systems at a General License Facility" were employed as regulatory standard and criteria. This paper shows results of criticality analysis with respect to each designated criterion with modeling of a virtual nuclear fuel assembly and a cask body that induces the maximum reactivity among various design basis fuels of the metal cask. In addition, the sensitivity analysis of nuclear criticality taking into account the various modeling deviation such as manufacturing tolerance and modeling assumptions of conventional models was carried out to ensure the reliability of the analysis result. The criticality evaluation result of the metal cask and the maximum k(eff) under normal and off-normal conditions were 0.36884 and 0.46255, respectively. The maximum k(eff) under a postulated accident condition triggering flux trap reduction between baskets was evaluated to be 0.37854. In addition, the maximum k(eff) under a postulated accident condition of a natural disaster in case of a flooding, was evaluated to be 0.94658 as a maximum reactivity. The criticality evaluations under the above storage conditions showed values below the regulatory requirement (0.95) and the values confirm adequate safety in terms of nuclear criticality.

J	Huang, H; Spencer, B; Hales, J				Huang, Hai; Spencer, Benjamin; Hales, Jason			Discrete element method for simulation of early-life thermal fracturing behavior in ceramic nuclear fuel pellets	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							CLADDING MECHANICAL INTERACTION; MULTIPLE CRACK-PROPAGATION; INTERACTING CRACKS; BRITTLE SOLIDS; SPRING NETWORK; MODEL; UO2; MICROSTRUCTURE; STRENGTH; SHOCK	A discrete element method (DEM) representation of coupled solid mechanics, fracturing and heat conduction processes is developed and applied to explicitly simulate the random initiation and subsequent propagation of interacting thermal cracks in a ceramic nuclear fuel pellet during initial rise to power and during power cycles. The DEM model clearly predicts realistic early-life crack patterns including both radial and circumferential cracks. Simulation results clearly demonstrate the formation of radial cracks during the initial power rise and formation of circumferential cracks as the power is ramped down. In these simulations, additional early-life power cycles do not lead to the formation of new thermal cracks. They do, however clearly indicate changes in the apertures of thermal cracks during later power cycles due to thermal expansion and shrinkage. The number of radial cracks increases with increasing power, which is consistent with the experimental observations. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The relative positions of fuel and coolant have been inverted and U-Th-Zr-hydride fuel was used. Two-pass water flow scheme has been selected with the assemblies at the periphery of the core having downward flow. Fuel loading pattern and control rod loading pattern have also been proposed in order to achieve more uniform radial power distribution, high coolant outlet temperature and low cladding surface temperature. Three different axial enrichments were used for fuel to reduce the axial power peak which in turn resulted in lower cladding surface temperature. A coupled neutronics and thermal hydraulics analysis was performed for the proposed inverted pressure tube type (IPTT) SCWR and an equilibrium core was analyzed. The results show that, this concept has potential benefits in reducing the clad surface temperature and increasing the life cycle length. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wojciechowski, A				Wojciechowski, Andrzej			Influence of moderator to fuel ratio (MFR) on burning thorium in a subcritical assembly	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							POWER-DENSITY; SYSTEM	The conversion ratio (CR) of Th-232 to U-233 calculation results for a subcritical reactor assembly is presented as a function of MFR, burnup, power density (PD) and fissile concentration. The calculated model is based on subcritical assembly which makes configuration of fuel rods and volumes of moderator and coolant changes possible. This comfortable assembly enables investigation of CR in a thorium cycle for different value of MFR. Additionally, the calculation results of U-233 saturation concentration are explained by mathematical model. The value of MFR main influences the saturation concentration of U-233 and fissile and the fissile concentration dependence of CR. The saturation value of CR is included in the range CR is an element of (0.911, 0.966) and is a slowly increasing function of MFR. The calculations were done with a MCNPX 2.7 code.

The production of residual nuclides in Pb irradiated by 400 MeV/u carbon ions	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Spallation reaction; Gamma-ray spectrum; Residual nuclide; Cross section	INTRANUCLEAR-CASCADE CALCULATION; PROTON-INDUCED REACTIONS; ENERGY HEAVY-IONS; C-12 IONS; CROSS-SECTIONS; SPALLATION; COPPER; FRAGMENTS; NUCLEUS; RANGE	The experiment was performed by irradiating a Pb foil with 400 MeV/u carbon beam at the HIRFL-CSR in Lanzhou, China. The experimental data was acquired by the off-line gamma-spectroscopy method. 32 radioactive residual nuclides had been observed and their cross sections were determined. The measured results were compared with the results simulated by Monte Carlo code MCNPX2.7.0. The comparison shows that the simulated cross sections were underestimated for the fragments from A = 20 to 41 and A = 110 to 175. By fitting the measured and simulated cross sections to Rudstams semi-empirical formula, it was found that the charge distribution of products was asymmetric for the residual nuclides with a high mass number.

The scCVD diamond detector has been deposited with 5 pm of lithium fluoride (LiF) layer to enhance the sensitivity to thermal neutrons. Time stability of the detector has been studied with alpha-source and good performance has been found for more than 12 h. Neutron irradiations have been performed in four quasi-monoenergetic neutron fields in the energy range from 2.50 MeV to 16.03 MeV. The measured response function of the scCVD diamond detector to 14.13 MeV neutrons shows a narrow C-12 (n, alpha)Be-9 reaction peak which is well isolated from other structures by about 1 MeV in energy, indicating the great potential as a fast neutron spectrometer.

The contributions of source regions to organ doses from incorporated radioactive iodine	RADIOPROTECTION			English	Article						Internal dose; voxel phantoms; thyroid agents	COMPUTATIONAL PHANTOMS; INTERNAL DOSIMETRY; RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS; MIRD	The separate contributions of all source regions to organ doses from I-131 and I-123 administered to the body were calculated using voxelized reference phantoms. The photon and electron components of organ doses were also evaluated for each source region. The MCNPX Monte Carlo particle transport code was utilized for dose calculations. All organs and tissues of male and female phantoms were taken into account as source regions with their corresponding cumulated activities. The results showed that cumulated activities assigned to source regions and inter-organ distances were two factors that strongly affected the contribution of each source to the organ dose. The major contribution of the dose to the main source regions arose from self-irradiation of electrons, while for nearby organs it was due to photons emitted by the main source organs. In addition, self-irradiation plays an important role in the dose delivered to most target organs for lower thyroid uptakes.

J	Peykov, P; Cameron, R				Peykov, Pavel; Cameron, Ron			Are Radioisotope Shortages a Thing of the Past?	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article								Since June 2009, the NEA and its High-level Group on the Security of Supply of Medical Radioisotopes (HLG-MR) have examined the causes of Mo-99/(99)mTc supply shortages and developed a policy approach, including principles and supporting recommendations to address those causes. The NEA has also reviewed the global Mo-99/(99)mTc supply situation periodically, using the most up-to-date data from supply chain participants, to highlight periods of reduced supply and underscore the case for implementing the HLG-MR policy approach in a timely and globally-consistent manner. In 2012, the NEA released a Mo-99 supply and demand update for the period up to 2030 (A Supply and Demand Update of the Molybdenum-99 Market, OECD/NEA, 2012), identifying periods of low supply relative to demand. This paper presents the preliminary results from an updated Mo-99 supply and demand forecast, focusing on the potentially critical 2015-2020 period, when two major Mo-99 producers (the NRU reactor in Canada and the OSI-RIS reactor in France). are scheduled to cease 99Mo irradiations. On the demand side, the NM had previously released a study with the results from a global survey of future demand for Mo-99/(99)mTc (OECD-NEA, 2011), devising a scenario based on a data assessment by an expert advisory group. In the current analysis, the expected demand growth rate and total demand have been modified,,based on the latest information from supply chain participants. On the supply side, the NM has updated the list of current and planned new Mo-99/(99)mTc irradiation and processing projects. The modelling results incorporate revisions to production start/end dates, potential additional projects, and impacts of converting to the use of low-enriched uranium (LEU) targets on Mo-99/(99)mTc capacity and production. The supply forecast horizon (2015 to 2020) has been chosen to reflect upcoming, important changes in global production capacity the planned shutdowns in Canada and France, and the expected commissioning of new reactor- and non-reactor-based projects in Europe, the United States, South America, and Australia.

J	Keienburg, B				Keienburg, Bettina			Legal Protection Issues with Regard to the Site Selection of a Final Repository for Heat-Generating Radioactive Wastes	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								The site selection law (hereinafter Stand-AG) adopted on 23.07 2013 and entirely entered into force on 01.01.2014 shall clarify especially the site selection question of a final repository for highly radioactive waste until the year 2031. For this purpose, the act regulates a comprehensive procedure with multiple public participations and multiple interventions of the legislator. Thus the legislator hopes for an accepted dispute decision on a permanent basis -meaning acceptance. It remains to be seen, if this expectation is realistic. The StandAG and the decisions provided already rise potential for dispute. Added to this is a large number of dispute potential with regard to scouting out in connection with the site selection - despite of legal regulations for scouting out sites and remaining sites- and required authorisation. The potential shall be reported below.

It is shown that the fabrication method significantly influences the density, crystal lattice parameter, O/U ratio and thermal conductivity of fuel pellets. The ammonium oxylate technology for coprecipitation of uranium and thorium with a precipitate containing simultaneously particles of different fractional composition, including nanosize particles, makes it possible to obtain sintered (U, Th)O-2 pellets with UO2 mass fraction 1- 13%, density 93-96% of the theoretical value and O/Me ratio <2.0. It is shown how the thermal conductivity of the fuel depends on the O/Me ratio.	[Kurina, I. S.; Rumyantsev, V. N.; Samoilov, S.

RADIATION BALANCE OF SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL FROM THERMAL REACTORS AND THE EQUIVALENT URANIUM MASS FOR NATURAL ORGANISMS	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The conditions for the onset of radiation equivalence of spent nuclear fuel from VVER and the equivalent mass of natural uranium according to the irradiation dose to organisms of surface ecosystems is investigated. It is found that organisms of soil biota receive the highest dose; mammals are the critical organisms for determining the requirements for wastes in terms of minimizing the onset time of radiation balance. The requirement for the onset of radiation balance in an acceptable time similar to 300 years can be met by separating from the spent nuclear fuel U, Pu, and Am with the residual amount in wastes no more than 0.1%. Radiation equivalence appears more quickly as the reactor run decreases or the depth of fuel burnup decreases. The results of this work confirm the main positions concerning radiation equivalence which were developed on the basis of comparative assessments of the biological hazard for man of the radionuclides present in the spent fuel and raw uranium.

A Study of a GEM Tracking Detector for Imaging Positrons from PET Radioisotopes in Plants	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM); plant; Positron Emission Tomography (PET); positron imaging	TRANSPORT; RICE	Positron Emission Tomography is a powerful imaging technique used for humans and animals that can also be used to study plant biology. However, since many of the structures found on plants (e. g., leaves) are very thin, a large portion of the positrons emitted from PET isotopes escape before annihilation, leading to low efficiency and quantification inaccuracies. In this study, a gas tracking detector was used to measure escaping positrons from PET radiotracer isotopes which has the ability to reconstruct three dimensional tracks that can be used to form an image of the emitting object. This device uses a triple GEM detector with a short drift region and an XY strip readout plane to measure a vector for positrons passing through a drift gap. By projecting each particle track back to the object surface, a 2-D image of the spatial distribution of the positrons that escaped from that surface can be reconstructed. In this paper, we will describe the basic principle of the GEM detector and present results on its performance using various types of phantoms and actual plant specimens. Monte Carlo simulations are also used to better understand the detector performance and compare to actual measurements.

Boron-10 Based Neutron Coincidence Counter for Safeguards	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Alternative neutron detectors; boron-10; coincidence counter; helium-3 alternative; neutron detection; safeguards; UNCL	HE-3	The shortage of He-3 has triggered the search for effective alternative neutron detection technologies for national security applications, including international nuclear safeguards. Any alternative neutron detection technology must meet a neutron detection efficiency requirement while being insensitive to gamma-ray interference at a prescribed level. For nuclear safeguards, a system must perform measurements in the field with a prescribed precision in a specified time. This paper describes an effort to design, model and test an alternatives-based neutron coincidence counter for nuclear safeguards applications. The technology chosen for use in an alternatives-based uranium neutron coincidence collar was boron-lined proportional counters. Extensive modeling was performed of various system configurations and comparisons were made to measurements on a commercial prototype boron-10 based uranium neutron coincidence collar.

We have studied counter sizes up to 120 x 40 x 5 mm(3) with series connection of multiple SiPMs to increase the sensitive area and thus achieve better time resolution. A readout scheme with analog shaping and digital waveform analysis is optimized to achieve the highest time resolution. The timing performance is measured using electrons from a Sr-90 radioactive source, comparing different scintillators, counter dimensions, and types of near-ultraviolet sensitive SiPMs. As a result, a resolution of sigma = 42 +/- 2 ps at 1 MeV energy deposition is obtained for counter size 60 x 30 x 5 mm(3) with three SiPMs (3 x 2 mm(2) each) at each end of the scintillator. The time resolution improves with the number of photons detected by the SiPMs. The SiPMs from Hamamatsu Photonics give the best time resolution because of their high photon detection efficiency in the near-ultraviolet region. Further improvement is possible by increasing the number of SiPMs attached to the scintillator.

Development of a Phoswich Detector for Radioxenon Field Measurements	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Nuclear explosion monitoring; phoswich scintillation counter; radioxenon detection	BETA-GAMMA COINCIDENCE; RADIOACTIVE XENON; SYSTEM	The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization deploys a variety of radioxenon detection systems as part of its International Monitoring System to detect nuclear explosions. To achieve the high sensitivity required, the systems extract xenon from several cubic meters of air and look for characteristic radioactive emissions, using either high resolution high purity germanium gamma detectors or multiple scintillators for high efficiency beta/gamma coincidence detection. The high sensitivity comes at the expense of heavy lead shielding, and for the latter, calibration and gain matching of multiple photomultiplier tubes as well as a memory effect of the plastic scintillator used for beta detection which absorbs Xe. Existing systems are also stationary by design, though in some applications, for example on-site inspections, a portable detector is required. In this work, we therefore redesigned a previously developed phoswich detector to reduce size, weight, cost, complexity and memory effect with only minor impact on the sensitivity. The phoswich design requires only a single photomultiplier tube with beta/gammacoincidences being detected by digital pulse shape analysis. Additional gain stabilization addresses varying environmental field conditions, such as temperature changes. Three phoswich geometries were modeled through Monte Carlo simulations, the most promising was built and tested. In this paper we describe each of the initial designs, their simulated performances and the factors that lead us to the chosen design. Preliminary results from testing of the prototype detector are presented and compared with simulation.	[Hennig, W.; Asztalos, S. J.; Warburton, W.

In order to evaluate the effect of typical cool-down processes on the radial hydride precipitation, two terminal heat-up temperatures of 300 and 400 degrees C, as well as two terminal cool-down temperatures of 200 and 300 degrees C, were considered. In addition, two cooling rates of 2.5 and 8.0 degrees C/min during the cool-down processes were taken into account along with zero stress or a tensile hoop stress of 150MPa. It was found that the 250ppm hydrogen-charged specimen experiencing the higher terminal heat-up temperature and the lower terminal cool-down temperature generated the highest number of radial hydrides during the cool-down process under 150MPa hoop tensile stress, which may be explained by terminal solid hydrogen solubilities for precipitation, and dissolution and remaining circumferential hydrides at the terminal heat-up temperatures. In addition, the slower cool-down rate generates the larger number of radial hydrides due to a cooling rate-dependent, longer residence time at a relatively high temperature that can accelerate the radial hydride nucleation and growth.

Chemisorption energies vs. distance of molecules from UN(001) and UN(111) surfaces have been optimized for four symmetrical chemisorption sites, respectively. The results show that the Hollow, N-top, and Hollow adsorption sites are the most stable sites for H, C, and O atoms with chemisorption energies of 13.06, 25.50 and 27.34 kJ/mol for UN(001) surface, respectively. From the point of adsorbent (UN(001) and UN(111) surfaces in this paper), interaction of O with the chemisorbed surface is of the maximum magnitude, then C and H, which are in agreement with electronegativities of individual atoms. For the UN(001) surface, U-N bond lengths change relatively little (< 9%) as a result of H chemisorption, however C and O chemisorptions result in remarkable changes for U-N bond lengths in interlayer (> 10%). Electronic structure calculations indicate that Bridge position is equivalent with Hollow position, and the most stable chemisorption position for H, C, and O atoms are all Bridge (or Hollow) position for the UN(111) surface. Calculated electronic density of states (DOSs) demonstrate electronic charge transfer between s, p orbitals in chemisorbed atoms and U 6d, 5f orbitals.

The model sensitivity to the effective volume and mass of vaporized soil particles is examined. Compared with other fractionation models, the new method has a much better performance in calculating Y-89,Y-95, but the calculated cumulative activity fraction for particles in diameters over 100 mu m is in between the results using the F-T and G-X models. It is concluded that in a near surface nuclear explosion radioactivity is mainly distributed in soil particles which have not been vaporized, and according to the Henry's law and ideal gas law, Y-89,Y-95 may vary in larger particles when effective volume of the fireball is changed.

PHOTON DOSES IN NPL STANDARD NEUTRON FIELDS	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								Standard neutron fields are invariably accompanied by a photon component due to the neutron-generating reactions and secondary neutron interactions in the surrounding environment. A set of energy-compensated Geiger-Muller (GM) tubes and electronic personal dosemeters (EPDs) have been used to measure the photon dose rates in a number of standard radionuclide and accelerator-based neutron fields. The GM tubes were first characterised in standard radioisotope and X-ray photon fields and then modelled using MCNP to determine their photon dose response as a function of energy. Values for the photon-to-neutron dose equivalent ratios are presented and compared with other published values.	[Roberts, N. J.; Horwood, N. A.; McKay, C.

RADIATION PROTECTION STUDY RELATED TO THE FUTURE POST-ACCELERATOR OF THE HIE-ISOLDE PROJECT	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								The HIE-ISOLDE project aims at expanding the physics programme of the ISOLDE facility at CERN. In particular, the addition of a superconducting linac will allow the post-acceleration of radioactive ion beams up to 10 MeV/u. However, because of field emission in the superconducting cavities and the possibility of neutron production for ion interactions above the Coulomb barrier, new radiological hazards need to be mitigated. Measurements of dose rate levels close to cavity prototypes were used to determine the intensity of the source of X ray due to field emission for a single cavity. The results were extrapolated to the operation of the 32 cavities that will be installed, and a detailed FLUKA calculation was performed to determine the required shielding to minimise the exposure of personnel present in the ISOLDE experimental hall during operation. FLUKA was also used to determine the maximum ambient dose equivalent rate levels in the accessible part of the hall due to ion beam losses for the envelope energies and intensities.

EVALUATION OF THE RADIATION FIELD AND SHIELDING ASSESSMENT OF THE EXPERIMENTAL AREA OF HIE-ISOLDE	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							ACCELERATED RADIOACTIVE BEAMS; REX-ISOLDE	The ISOLDE facility at CERN is one of the first facilities in the world dedicated to the production of the radioactive ion beams (RIB) and during all its working time underwent several upgrades. The goal of the latest proposed upgrade, 'The High Intensity and Energy ISOLDE' (HIE-ISOLDE), is to provide a higher performance facility in order to approximate it to the level of the next generation ISOL facilities, like EURISOL. The HIE-ISOLDE aims to improve significantly the quality of the produced RIB and for this reason the increasing of the primary beam power is one of the main objectives of the project. An increase in the nominal beam current (from 2 to 6 mu A proton beam intensity) and energy (from 1.4 GeV to 2 GeV) of the primary proton beam will be possible due to the upgrade of CERN's accelerator infrastructure. The current upgrade means reassessment of the radiation protection and the radiation safety of the facility. However, an evaluation of the existing shielding configuration and access restrictions to the experimental and supply areas must be carried out. Monte Carlo calculations were performed in order to evaluate the radiation protection of the facility as well as radiation shielding assessment and design. The FLUKA-Monte Carlo code was used in this study to calculate the ambient dose rate distribution and particle fluxes in the most important areas, such as the experimental hall of the facility. The results indicate a significant increase in the ambient dose equivalent rate in some areas of the experimental hall when an upgrade configuration of the primary proton beam is considered. Special attention is required for the shielding of the target area once it is the main and very intensive radiation source, especially under the upgrade conditions. In this study, the access points to the beam extraction and beam maintenance areas, such as the mass separator rooms and the high voltage room, are identified as the most sensitive for the experimental hall from the radiation protection point of view.

The solubility of (PuO2)-Pu-242 in the presence of aqueous Fe(II): the impact of precipitate preparation	RADIOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Plutonium; Iron; Aqueous; Solubility; Precipitate	PU(IV) HYDROUS OXIDE; HETEROGENEOUS REDUCTION; IRON-OXIDES; MAGNETITE; SORPTION; URANIUM(VI); PLUTONIUM; SURFACE; PERTECHNETATE; NEPTUNIUM(V)	The solubility of different forms of precipitated (PuO2)-Pu-242 (am) were examined in solutions containing aqueous Fe(II) over a range of pH values. The first series of (PuO2)-Pu-242 (am) suspensions were prepared from a Pu-242(IV) stock that had been treated with thenoyl-trifluoroacetone (TTA) to remove the Am-241 originating from the decay of Pu-241. These (PuO2)-Pu-242 (am) suspensions showed much higher solubilities at the same pH value and Fe(II) concentration than previous studies using (PuO2)-Pu-239 (am). X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy of the precipitates showed a substantially reduced Pu-Pu backscatter over that previously observed in (PuO2)-Pu-239 (am) precipitates, indicating that the (PuO2)-Pu-242 (am) precipitates purified using TTA lacked the long range order previously found in (PuO2)-Pu-239 (am) precipitates. The Pu(IV) stock solution was subsequently repurified using an ion exchange resin and an additional series of (PuO2)-Pu-242 (am) precipitates prepared. These suspensions showed higher redox potentials and total aqueous Pu concentrations than the TTA purified stock solution. The higher redox potential and aqueous Pu concentrations were in general agreement with previous studies on (PuO2)-Pu-242 (am) precipitates, presumably due to the removal of possible organic compounds originally present in the TTA purified stock. (PuO2)-Pu-242 (am) suspensions prepared with both stock solutions showed almost identical solubilities in Fe(II) containing solutions even though the initial aqueous Pu concentrations before the addition of Fe(II) were orders of magnitude different. By examining the solubility of (PuO2)-Pu-242 (am) prepared from both stocks in this way we have essentially approached equilibrium from both the undersaturated and oversaturated conditions. The final aqueous Pu concentrations are predictable using a chemical equilibrium model which includes the formation of a nanometer sized Fe(III) reaction product, identified in the (PuO2)-Pu-242 (am) suspension both by use of Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis.

The effect of various parameters on the extraction step including type and volume of extraction and dispersive solvents, pH of solution, concentration of PAN, extraction time, sample volume and ionic strength were studied and optimized. Under the optimum conditions, the limit of detection (LOD) and preconcentration factor were 0.3 mu g L-1 and 194, respectively. Furthermore, the relative standard deviation of the ten replicate was <2.6%. The developed procedure was then applied to the extraction and determination of uranium in the water samples.

The sorption of Am(III) onto the resin containing one diglycolamide (DGA) moiety (DGSR-I) was less efficient than the resin containing two DGA moieties (DGSR-II) with Lagergren first order rate constants of (1.20 +/- 0.03) x 10(-3) s(-1) and (2.01 +/- 0.05) x 10(-3) s(-1), respectively. The maximum sorption of Eu(III) (used as a representative of the trivalent lanthanide/actinide ions in radioactive wastes) was 10.4 +/- 1.1 mg g(-1) and 13.9 +/- 1.3 mg g(-1) by the DGSR-I and DGSR-II, respectively. The sorption of Eu(III) on the grafted silica resins followed the Langmuir monolayer sorption phenomenon with sorption energies of 16.5 +/- 2.05 and 17.8 +/- 1.6 kJ mol(-1) for DGSR-I and DGSR-II, respectively. Column experiments revealed that the breakthrough capacity of Eu(III) on the DGSR-II column was higher than that on the DGSR-I column. Efficient elution could be achieved with a 0.01 M EDTA solution. The radiolytic stability of the resins was ascertained by exposing the resins to a gamma ray dose up to 1030 kGy resulting in a decrease of the K-d values with about 50%; at doses < 500 kGy the K-d values remained unaffected.

The use of composite ferrocyanide materials for treatment of high salinity liquid radioactive wastes rich in cesium isotopes	RADIOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Cesium; Liquid radioactive wastes; Composite; Ferrocyanide		The use of composite materials based on metal ferrocyanides combined with natural mineral sorbents for treatment of high salinity Cs-containing liquid radioactive waste (LRW) was investigated. The study indicated that among the investigated composites, the best sorption characteristics for Cs were shown by materials based on copper ferrocyanide. Several factors affecting the removal of cesium from LRW, namely total salt content, pH and organic matter content, were also investigated. High concentrations of complexing organic matter significantly reduced the sorption capacity of ferrocyanide sorbents.

Materials and methods: Po-210 was analyzed in the food materials consumed by the male and female individual representatives living in the high background areas by 24-h Duplicate Diet Study (DDS) and Market Basket Study (MBS). The MBS was performed by collecting the food samples such as, cereals, fruits, leafy vegetables, roots and tubers, other vegetables, fish, meat and milk grown in the high background radiation zone of southern Tamil Nadu as a part of baseline study in this region.The DDS was done by collecting the food materials consumed including the beverages in 24 h from different age groups of male and female individuals living in the village of Puttetti. The intake and ingestion dose of the radionuclide Po-210 was estimated. Results: The average concentration of 210P0 in DDS (n = 33) was found to be 74 mBq.kg-1 of fresh weight. The MBS was collected based on food consumption representing more than 8595% of annual supply, and were divided into eight food groups. The average concentration of Po-210 in the eight food groups namely leafy vegetables was 2176 mBq.kg-1 (n =3), vegetables 55 mBq.kg-1 (n = 10), roots and tubers 251 mBq.kg-1 (n = 4), fruits 65 mBq.kg -1 (n = 5), fish 345 mBq.kg -1 (n = 2), meat food 117 mBq.kg-1 (n = 3), milk 20 mBq.kg-1 (n = 1) and cereal 290 (n = 1) mBq.kg-1 of fresh weight, respectively. The annual intake and ingestion dose due to Po-210 was estimated by DDS and MBS in adults, adolescents and children. The overall results showed that the MBS was moderately higher than the DDS in all age groups. Moreover, a DDS approach may even be more realistic, as cooked foodstuffs are used for dietary exposure assessment. Conclusion:The study confirms that the current levels of Po-210 do not pose a significant radiological risk to the local inhabitants.

Predictive Modeling of Coupled Systems: Uncertainty Reduction Using Multiple Reactor Physics Benchmarks	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							NON-LINEAR SYSTEMS; THERMAL-HYDRAULICS; SENSITIVITY THEORY; CALIBRATION; ADJUSTMENT; CODE	This work illustrates reactor physics applications of the predictive modeling of coupled multiphysics systems (PMCMPS), formulated by Cacuci (2014), by means of the benchmarks Godiva (a bare uranium sphere) and Jezebel-239 and Jezebel-240 (bare plutonium spheres). The PMCMPS methodology was ab initio developed in the response space, to reduce as much as possible the computational memory requirements for predictive modeling of very large systems involving not only many model parameters but also many model responses. The model parameters considered in this work include individual cross sections for each material, nuclide, reaction type, and energy group, giving the following totals: 2241 parameters for Jezebel-239, 1458 parameters for Jezebel-240, and 2916 parameters for Godiva. Eight responses were considered for Jezebel-239 (the effective multiplication factor; the center core fission rates for U-233, U-238, Np-237, and Pu-239; and the center core radiative capture rates for Mn-55, Nb-93, and Cu-63). Three responses (the effective multiplication factor and the center core fission rates for U-233 and Np-237) were selected for Jezebel-240, and eleven responses were selected for Godiva (the reaction rate types listed for Jezebel-239, along with the radiative capture rates for Ag-107, I-127, and Br-81). The PMCMPS methodology ensures that increasing the amount of information yields more accurate predictions, with smaller predicted uncertainties, as long as the considered information is consistent. This fact is amply illustrated in this work, which shows that the interdependence of responses that were measured in more than one benchmark is stronger than for responses that were measured in a single benchmark. More generally, the consideration of the complete information, including couplings, provided jointly by all three benchmarks (as opposed to consideration of the benchmarks as separate systems) leads to more accurate predictions of nominal values for responses and model parameters, yielding larger reductions in the predicted uncertainties that accompany the predicted mean values of responses and model parameters.

A Validation Study of Pin Heat Transfer for MOX Fuel Based on the IFA-597 Experiments	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							CODE; UO2	The IFA-597 (Integrated Fuel Assessment) experiments from the International Fuel Performance Experiments database were designed to study the thermal behavior of mixed oxide (MOX) fuel and the effects of an annulus on fission gas release in light water reactor fuel. An evaluation of nuclear fuel pin heat transfer in the FRAPCON-3.4 and Exnihilo codes for MOX fuel systems was performed, with a focus on the first 20 time steps (similar to 6 GWd/tonne initial heavy metal) for explicit comparison between the codes. In addition, sensitivity studies were performed to evaluate the effect of the radial power shape and approximations to the geometry to account for the thermocouple hole, dish, and chamfer. The analysis demonstrated relative agreement for both solid (rod 1) and annular (rod 2) fuel in the experiment, demonstrating the accuracy of the codes and their underlying material models for MOX fuel, while also revealing a small energy loss artifact in how gap conductance is currently handled in Exnihilo for chamfered fuel pellets. The within-pellet power shape was shown to impact the predicted centerline temperatures significantly. This has provided an initial benchmarking of the pin heat transfer capability of Exnihilo for MOX fuel with respect to a well-validated nuclear fuel performance code. This analysis was done for a heavy-water boiling water reactor, but the conclusions are not limited by the reactor type beyond the spectrum and particular materials.

J	Passerini, S; Kazimi, MS; Shwageraus, E				Passerini, Stefano; Kazimi, Mujid S.; Shwageraus, Eugene			A Systematic Approach to Nuclear Fuel Cycle Analysis and Optimization	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article								Experience with modeling fuel cycle options reveals that the large amount of generated data makes it difficult to understand trade-offs among fuel cycle policies. This paper shows that numerical optimization can be used to better identify impacts of fuel cycle policies and condense the generated data against a few significant criteria. The once-through cycle is considered the baseline case, while advanced technologies with fuel recycling characterize the alternative fuel cycle options available in the future. The options include, among others, recycling the fissile materials from spent light water reactor fuel in fast reactors (FRs) as well as deployment of innovative recycling reactor technologies, such as the U-235 initiated FRs. Additionally, a first-of-a-kind optimization scheme for the nuclear fuel cycle analysis is described. Optimization metrics of interest to different stakeholders in the fuel cycle (economics, fuel resource utilization, high-level waste, transuranic materials/proliferation management, and environmental impact) are utilized for two different optimization techniques: a linear one and a stochastic one. Stakeholder elicitation provided sets of relative weights for the identified metrics appropriate to each stakeholder group, which were then used to demonstrate feasibility of arrival at optimum fuel cycle configurations for recycling technologies. The stochastic optimization tool, based on a genetic algorithm, was used to identify noninferior solutions according to Pareto's dominance approach to optimization. The main trade-off for fuel cycle optimization was found to be between emphasizing economics versus most of the other identified metrics.

J	Farkas, R; Nichita, E				Farkas, Robert; Nichita, Eleodor			MODERATOR DISPLACERS FOR REDUCING COOLANT VOID REACTIVITY IN CANDU REACTORS: A SCOPING STUDY	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						CANDU reactor; coolant void reactivity; moderator displacers		When the coolant is voided in the lattice of a Canada deuterium uranium (CANDU) reactor, the net reactivity change is positive, due primarily to the fact that the coolant and moderator are separated and the coolant volume is much smaller than the moderator volume. The modest loss in moderation occurring when coolant is lost is not sufficient to offset the positive reactivity contributions of increased fast fission rate and reduced epithermal absorption. A way to achieve a negative net reactivity effect on coolant voiding is to increase the importance of moderation in the coolant by decreasing the moderator-to-coolant volume ratio. This work proposes reducing the moderator-to-coolant volume ratio in existing CANDU reactors by packing the moderator with displacers in the shape of hollow spheres in a close-packed pattern. Several materials and shell thickness values are investigated for different fuel enrichments. Calculations are performed using the lattice code DRAGON. Results show that it is possible to reduce the coolant void reactivity in a CANDU lattice with spherical moderator displacers arranged in a hexagonal closed-packed array, albeit at a cost in discharge burnup.

To study the feasibility of the zeolite column system from an engineering aspect, an engineering-scale zeolite column apparatus was installed. Measurements of the superficial velocities of molten salt passing through the columns filled with granular form type-A zeolite at various driving pressures showed that the conventional relationship of the velocity and pressure loss in the components of the apparatus can be useful for the molten salt system. Then, a demonstration test to simulate the decontamination of a fission product, which was represented by cesium, was performed using a zeolite that had been pretreated in aqueous solutions to remove the sodium. Although the absorbed amount of cesium was not as high as previously reported, the concentration of cesium in the effluent salt exhibited a breakthrough curve. Therefore, some of the cesium in the salt was absorbed into the zeolite, and accordingly, the feasibility of the zeolite column system was demonstrated.
