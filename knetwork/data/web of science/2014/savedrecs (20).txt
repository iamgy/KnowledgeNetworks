In the present study, the direct production of this radioisotope by charged particle irradiation was investigated using Monte Carlo method. After scouting of the reactions that produce Tc-99m, excitation functions of these reactions were predicted by optical model components in the TALYS-1.6 code. Suitable energy range of projectile for this production was selected by spotting of maximum cross section and minimum impurity due to other emission channels. Then target geometry was designed based on stopping power calculation by the SRIM code. Thick target yield of Mo-100(p,2n)Tc-99m, (98)mo(p,7)Tc-99m and Mo-nat(p,x)Tc-99m reactions was predicted by the result of excitation function and stopping power calculations. Finally, Mo-199(p,2n)Tc-99m reaction was selected as a primary reaction for the direct production of Tc-99m and its process was simulated by employing the MCNPX code to calculate the energy distribution of proton in the Mo-199 target body and estimation of residual nuclei during irradiation. Good agreement was obtained between the experimental, the theoretical, and the simulation-based (analytical and directly) production yields. This study demonstrated that Monte Carlo provides a method for the design and optimization of targets for the radionuclide production purposes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Molecular-flow time properties of RIB type vapor-transport systems using a fast-valve	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Fast-valve; Molecular-flow; Vapor-transport system; Monte-Carlo simulation; Radioactive ion beam	PRODUCTION TARGET APPLICATIONS; ISOTOPE-SEPARATION ONLINE; COMPOUND MATERIALS; ION; FACILITIES; MATRICES	The advent of the fast-valve device, described previously, permits measurement of molecular-flow times of chemically active or inactive gaseous species through radioactive ion beam (RIB) target-ion-source systems, independent of size, geometry and materials of construction. Thus, decay losses of short-half-life RIBs can be determined for a given target/vapor-transport system in advance of on-line operation, thereby ascertaining the feasibility of the system design for successful processing of a given isotope. In this article, molecular-flow-time theory and experimentally measured molecular-flow time data are given for serial- and parallel-coupled Ta metal RIB vapor-transport systems similar to those used at ISOL based RIB facilities. In addition, the effect of source type on the molecular-flow time properties of a given system is addressed, and a chemical passivation method for negating surface adsorption enthalpies for chemically active gaseous species on Ta surfaces is demonstrated.

Energy-angle correlation of neutrons and gamma-rays emitted from an HEU source	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Special Nuclear Materials; Monte Carlo simulation; Energy spectra of neutrons and gamma-rays; Joint and marginal probability density functions; Covariance and correlation	NUCLEAR MATERIAL	Special Nuclear Materials (SNM) yield very unique Fission signatures, namely correlated neutrons and gamma-rays. A major challenge is not only to detect, but also to rapidly identify and recognize SNM with certainty. Accounting for particle multiplicity and correlations is one of standard ways to detect SNM. However, many parameter data such as joint distributions of energy, angle, lifetime, and multiplicity of neutrons and gamma-rays can lead to better recognition of SNM signatures in the background radiation noise. These joint distributions are not well understood. The Monte Carlo simulations of the transport of neutrons and gamma-rays produced from spontaneous and interrogation-induced fission of SNM are carried out using the developed MONSOL computer code. The energy spectra of neutrons and gamma-rays from a bare Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) source are investigated. The energy spectrum of gamma-rays shows spectral lines by which HEU isotopes can be identified, while those of neutrons do not show any characteristic lines. The joint probability density function (JPDF) of the energy-angle association of neutrons and gamma-rays is constructed. Marginal probability density functions (MPDFs) of energy and angle are derived from JPDF. A probabilistic model is developed for the analysis of JPDF and MPDFs. This probabilistic model is used to evaluate mean values, standard deviations, covariance and correlation between the energy and angle of neutrons and gamma-rays emitted from the HEU source. For both neutrons and gamma-rays, it is found that the energy-angle variables are only weakly correlated. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

That is expected to be as an effective and safe method to consume surplus plutonium accumulated in Japan. A similar concept proposed by General Atomics (GA), Deep Burn, cannot be introduced to Japan because of its adopting highly enriched plutonium, which shall infringe on a Japanese nuclear nonproliferation policy according to Japan-US reprocessing negotiation. The Clean Burn concept can avoid this problem by employing an inert matrix fuel (IMF) and a tightly coupled fuel reprocessing and fabrication plants. Both features make it impossible to extract plutonium alone out of the fabrication process and its outcomes. As a result, the Clean Burn can use surplus plutonium as a fuel without mixing it with uranium matrix. Thus, surplus plutonium alone will be incinerated effectively, while generation of plutonium from the uranium matrix is avoided. High neutronic performance, i.e., achievement of burn-up of about 500 GWd/t and consumption ratio of plutonium-239 reaching to about 95%, is also assessed. Furthermore, reactivity defect caused by the inert matrix is found to be negligible. It is concluded that the Clean Burn concept is a useful option to incinerate plutonium with high proliferation resistance.

J	Peinsipp, N				Peinsipp, Norbert			Transmutation - Licenses According to the Atomic Energy and Radiation Protection Law	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Editorial Material								The Site Selection Act shared by the broad party consensus from 23 July 2013 regulates the procedure for the nuclear waste repository selection for already incurred and further incurring highly radioactive waste in Germany until the end of commercial use of nuclear energy for power generation in 2022. The site must provide "the best-possible safety for a time period of one million years". This requirement for a long-term safety is already substantially given by the radioactive plant wastes containing residues of transuranic elements. The requirements for long-term safety, demand for space and host rock of a final repository could be decreased when the radio-toxicity of waste and with it the quantity of highly radioactive waste before its final storage would be considerably reduced. This is an essential target of transmutation a targeted conversion of so called long-living radionuclides through neutron bombardment into ones with lower decay time. An extensive research project supported by the EU in Mol/Belgium - MYRRA Multi-Purpose Hybrid Research Reactor for High-Tech Applications-Project shall examine the feasibility of transmutation before 2030 in an industrialized framework. The atomic energy and radiation protection aspects for a possible application of transmutation in Germany are being analysed and discussed.									0	0	0	0	2	INFORUM VERLAGS-VERWALTUNGSGESELLSCHAFT MBH	BERLIN	ROBERT-KOCH-PLATZ 4, BERLIN, 10115, GERMANY	1431-5254			ATW-INT J NUCL POWER	ATW-Int.

At present incineration is the only approved way of treatment in Germany. But capacities are limited and incineration by itself is known to be a technically complex and rather expansive process. Therefore within an experimental proof of concept it should be examined whether an electrochemical incineration process is also applicable for this purpose. The R&D activities mainly comprised the gathering of informations about the chemical nature and constitution of such liquid wastes from enterprises, research laboratories and a number of the state owned collecting facilities, numerous electrochemical examinations with typical organic substances and finally electrolysis tests with original carbon-14 waste solution at lab-scale. We were able to demonstrate that electrochemical oxidation permits almost quantitative mineralization of the organic waste substances. The carbon dioxide released during electrolysis was completely fixed as solid calcium carbonate which is acceptable for final repository. An estimate shows that in comparison to conventional incineration a substantial decrease in the costs of treatment and repository can be expected. With regard to technical application further steps of development are necessary.

J	Niese, S				Niese, Siegfried			Naming and Discovery of Actinium and Protactinium - Two Stepchildren of Radioecology	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article							ELEMENT	In literature one will find only and exclusively Debierne as discoverer of Actinium and mostly Hahn and Meitner, often as well Fajans and Gohring for Protactinium. This article demonstrates that Giesel discovered Ac in 1902 and not Debierne in 1899. The name given by Debierne to the radioactive body similar to thorium found in the pitchblende was taken for the element Emanium named by Giesel. Pa was discovered in 1913 as short-living isotope 234mPa by Fajans and Gohring and called Brevium. The name Protactinium was given by Hahn and Meiner to the element; while they discovered the long-living 231Pa in 1918 as parent nuclide of 227Ac. Regardless of their high radio-toxicity the biogeochemical behaviour of both elements has been very rarely examined.

The aim of the present study is to quantify the effects of radon progeny on these stages with biophysical models. For this purpose, numerical models of mutation induction and clonal growth were applied in order to estimate how initiation, transformation and promotion rates depend on tissue dose rate. It was found that rates of initiation and transformation increase monotonically with dose rate, whereas effective promotion rate decreases with time but increases sublinearly with dose rate. Despite the uncertainty of results due to the lack of experimental data, present study suggests that effects of radon exposure on both mutational events and clonal growth are significant and should be considered in mechanistic models of carcinogenesis applied for analysing epidemiological data.

Comparative analysis between radiation doses obtained by EPR dosimetry using tooth enamel and established analytical methods for the population of radioactively contaminated territories	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Joint International Symposium on EPR Dosimetry and Dating and the International Conference on Biological Dosimetry (EPR-BioDose)	MAR 24-28, 2013	Leiden, NETHERLANDS					A comparative analysis of radiation doses determined by tooth enamel electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and by an acknowledged analytical method is performed for individual doses and for average doses in population of some settlements of the Bryansk region (Russia), which have been contaminated after the Chernobyl nuclear accident. The analysis is performed for doses in the range of 0-200 mGy for individuals and in the range of 0-50 mGy for the averaged populations. The method of orthogonal distance linear regression is used for the analysis. For both data sets the slopes of the regression line close to unity and the intercept close to zero are obtained, which indicates that doses determined by these two methods agree with each other. The root-mean-square difference between the results of EPR and analytical methods is estimated to be 35 mGy for individual doses and 15 mGy for averaged doses, which is consistent with uncertainty of these methods.

In this paper, detailed burnup calculations are carried out on an updated blanket. Two different blankets respectively fueled with the spent nuclear fuel (SNF) discharged from light water reactors (LWRs) or natural uranium oxide is investigated. In the first case, a three-batch out-to-in refueling strategy is designed. In the second case, some SNF assemblies are loaded into the blanket to help achieve tritium self-sufficiency. And a three-batch in-to-out refueling strategies is adopted to realize direct use of natural uranium oxide fuel in the blanket. The results show that only about 80 tonnes of SNF or natural uranium are needed every 1500 EFPD (Equivalent Full Power Day) with a 3000 MWth output and tritium self-sufficiency (TBR> 1.15), while the required maximum fusion powers are lower than 500 MW for both the two cases. Based on the proposed refueling strategies, the uranium utilization rate can reach about 4.0%. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to understand the two-phase flow details and investigate the influence factors on the hydrodynamic performance, in this paper the flow behaviors in the cylindrical bubble columns with different heights and purge gas inlet velocities using computational fluid dynamics coupled with population balance model were simulated. Liquid flow field, bubble Sauter mean diameter, time-averaged gas holdup and two-phase interfacial area for the different cases were obtained and compared. The simulation results showed good agreement with previous studies, and which indicated that bubble size and gas holdup formation are mainly determined by vortical flow. In addition, interfacial area can be enhanced by increasing the purge gas inlet velocity and column height. However, the enhancement effect will trail away when the gas inlet velocity is too fast, and the contribution of column height is relatively small. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the present paper, we establish two consistent methodologies for uncertainty quantification: a self-shielded cross section-based consistent methodology and an infinitely-diluted cross section-based consistent methodology. With these methodologies and the covariance data of uranium-238 nuclear data given in JENDL-3.3, we quantify uncertainties of infinite neutron multiplication factors of light water reactor and fast reactor fuel cells. While an inconsistent methodology gives results which depend on the energy group structure of neutron flux and neutron-nuclide reaction cross section representation, both the consistent methodologies give fair results with no such dependences.

SDTS technology has been used to analyze spent nuclear fuel and the pyro-processing of spent fuel. SDTS requires an external neutron source to induce the isotopic fissile fission. A high intensity neutron source is required to ensure a high for a good fissile fission. The electron linear accelerator system was selected to generate proper source neutrons efficiently. As a first step, the electron generator of an 80-keV electron gun was manufactured. In order to produce the high beam power from electron linear accelerator, a proper beam current is required form the electron generator. In this study, the beam current was measured by evaluating the performance of the electron generator. The beam current was determined by five parameters: high voltage at the electron gun, cathode voltage, pulse width, pulse amplitude, and bids voltage at the grid. From the experimental results under optimal conditions, the high voltage was determined to be 80 kV, the pulse width was 500 ns, and the cathode voltage was from 4.2 V to 4.6 V. The beam current was measured as 1.9 A at maximum. These results satisfy the beam current required for the operation of an electron linear accelerator.

The SFR fuel assemblies were designed for burning Th-232 fuel (fuel pin 1) and U-233 fuel (fuel pin 2) and include mixed minor actinide compositions. Monte Carlo simulations were performed using Serpent Code 1.1.19 to compare with CRAM (Chebyshev Rational Approximation Method) and TTA (Transmutation Trajectory Analysis) method in the burnup calculation mode. The total heating power generated in the system was assumed to be 2000 MWth. During the reactor operation period of 600 days, the effective multiplication factor (keff) was between 0.964 and 0.954 and peaking factor is 1.88867.

Mockup experiments were carried out in both the critical and subcritical states to investigate the influence of different thermal neutron profiles on the thorium capture and fission reactions. Thorium plate irradiation experiments for the thorium capture and fission reactions demonstrate fission reactions in the critical state, and the calculated-to-experiment values of reaction rates show accuracy within a relative difference of similar to 30%. In the ADS experiments with an external neutron source (14-MeV neutrons and 100-MeV protons), subcritical experiments were carried out in the thorium-loaded cores to investigate the influence of different thermal neutron profiles on thorium capture reaction rates by the measurement of In-115(n,gamma)In-116m In reactions. The results reveal the difference between reaction rate distributions attributed to varying not only the neutron spectrum of the core but also the external neutron source. A comparison between the measured and calculated reaction rate distributions reflects the accuracy of reaction-rate analyses for the thorium-loaded ADS experiments with an external neutron source. Additionally, kinetic experiments were carried out to deduce the prompt neutron decay constants and subcriticality by the pulsed neutron method.

The amounts of Si, S, Cl, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ga, As, Se and Cd were determined from 95 roadside dust samples collected along the Islamabad industrial area using Proton Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE). The results indicated that concentrations of all elements, except Cd, in the roadside dust were significant. The results of the enrichment factor show that the elementary composition of the roadside dust could be categorized as soil elements from the crust of the earth and elements from anthropogenic pollution. The high enrichment factors imply that elements such Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn, As, Se, Cd, Ni, Co and S came from anthropogenic activities. The source of metal contamination was identified using multivariate statistical analysis. It has been concluded that Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Mn and Fe mainly originate from crustal sources; Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn and Ga are associated with point-sources from industrial pollution/traffic; and S, Cl, K, As and Se are mainly related to oil/coal combustion.

It is simple, compact and cost-effective, with less secondary waste streams. Tributyl phosphate (TBP)-coated magnetic poly (styrene-divinylbenzene) (Pst-DVB) nano-particles were synthesized and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, vibrating sample magnetometer, thermogravimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. The application of TBP-coated magnetic Pst-DVB particles in separating low concentration of uranium from aqueous media was evaluated, and the equilibrium adsorption isotherm was investigated. Our results indicate that the TBP-coated magnetic Pst-DVB particles may be of potential application for uranium separation.

J	Bromley, BP; Hyland, B				Bromley, Blair P.; Hyland, Bronwyn			HETEROGENEOUS CORES FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THORIUM-BASED FUELS IN HEAVY WATER REACTORS	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						heavy water; thorium; heterogeneous		New reactor concepts to implement thorium-based fuel cycles have been explored to achieve maximum resource utilization. Pressure tube heavy water reactors (PT-HWRs) are highly advantageous for implementing thorium-based fuels because of their high neutron economy and online refueling capability. The use of heterogeneous seed/blanket core concepts in a PT-HWR where higher-fissile-content seed fuel bundles are physically separate from lower-fissile-content blanket bundles allows more flexibility and control in fuel management to maximize fissile utilization (FU) and conversion of fertile fuel. The lattice concept chosen was a 35-element bundle made with a homogeneous mixture of reactor-grade PuO2 (similar to 67 wt% fissile) and ThO2, with a central zirconia rod to reduce coolant void reactivity. Several annular and checkerboard-type heterogeneous seed/blanket core concepts with plutonium-thorium-based fuels in a 700-MW(electric)-class PT-HWR were analyzed, using a once-through thorium cycle. Different combinations of seed and blanket fuel were tested to determine the impact on core-average burnup, FU, power distributions, and other performance parameters. WIMS-AECL Version 3.1 was used to perform lattice physics calculations using two-dimensional, 89-group integral neutron transport theory, while RFSP Version 3.5.1 was used to perform the core physics and fuel management calculations using three-dimensional two-group diffusion theory. Among the different core concepts investigated, there were cores where the FU was up to 30% higher than that achieved in a PT-HWR using natural uranium fuel bundles. There were cores where up to 67% of the Pu was consumed, cores where up to 43% of the energy was produced from thorium, and cores where up to 363 kg/year of U-233 was produced in the discharged fuel.

FUEL MANAGEMENT OF PWR CORES WITH SILICON CARBIDE CLADDING	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						ceramic LWR fuel cladding; advanced nuclear fuel; SiC implications for PWR fuel management		The primary motivation for using silicon carbide rather than zirconium alloy cladding is its putative improvement in accident resistance, due to slow reactions with water, even at high temperatures. But, fuel management performance will also be an important consideration in its commercial acceptance. Whether backfittable 18- and 24-month cycles can be designed for existing light water reactors, their enrichments, operating characteristics, and fuel costs are questions that the present study undertakes to answer. Also evaluated is the possibility of leveraging silicon carbide's ability to sustain higher fuel duty for increasing power levels and discharge burnups in pressurized water reactors. A preliminary design using fuel rods with the same dimensions as in typical Westinghouse fuel, but with fuel pellets having a 10 vol % central void, has been adopted to mitigate the higher fuel temperatures when silicon carbide is used. This allows design of 18- and 24-month cycles that meet present-day operating constraints on peaking factor, boron concentration, reactivity coefficients, and shutdown margin, while achieving batch average discharge burnups up to 80 MWd/kg U, as well as power uprates of 10% and possibly 20%. Control rod configuration modifications may be required to meet the shutdown margin criterion for the 20% uprate. For nonuprated cores, silicon carbide-clad fuel may have a fuel cost advantage, especially with increasing discharge burnup, provided the fuel manufacturing cost is close to that of Zircaloy tubes. The economics of the fuel cycle also improve with power uprates, as the value of the additional energy generated may substantially exceed the advantage from fuel cost alone.

URANIUM STARTUP FAST REACTORS WITH METAL FUEL USING ONCE-THROUGH FUEL CYCLE	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						uranium startup fast reactors; metal fuel		The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the neutronic feasibility and competitive fuel cycle economics of sodium fast reactors operating with uranium metal (UZr) fuel on a once-through fuel cycle. Uranium startup fast reactors (USFRs) decouple their deployment from that of expensive reprocessing and recycle facilities. This could facilitate and speed up the deployment of conventional fast reactors, which, in their traditional designs, heavily depend on the availability of reprocessing facilities for transuranic fuel production. The uranium requirement and fuel cycle cost of studied USFR core designs are calculated to be comparable to those of typical light water reactors. The main design constraint is the fast neutron fluence imposed on the cladding material, which is required to be below 5.0 X 10(23) n/cm(2) even for advanced oxide dispersion strengthened steels. Therefore, moderators need to be inserted in the fuel assemblies to lower the fast neutron flux so that the fuel residence time limited by neutron fluence can be extended to match the reactivity limited fuel residence time. In this study, magnesium oxide is used for reflectors as well as for the moderator.	[Fei, T.; Driscoll, M.

Neutrons emitted from induced and spontaneous fission of different nuclides are very similar, making it difficult to measure these powders with nondestructive assay techniques. To measure the powders, a neutron multiplicity technique based on first-principle methods was developed to exploit isotope-specific nuclear properties, such as energy-dependent fission cross sections and neutron-induced fission multiplicity. This technique was tested through measurements using an epithermal neutron multiplicity counter with two different interrogation (alpha,n) sources and varying plutonium materials. To complement these measurements, extensive Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtended (MCNPX) simulations were performed for each measured sample, as well as samples that were not available to measure. The primary application of this first-principle technique is the measurement of materials containing uranium, neptunium, plutonium, and americium. This technique still has several challenges that need to be overcome, the largest of these being the ability to produce results with acceptably small uncertainties.

ANALYSIS OF CORRELATION AND REGRESSION BETWEEN PARTICLE IONIZING RADIATION PARAMETERS AND THE STABILITY CHARACTERISTICS OF IRRADIATED MONOCRYSTALLINE Si FILM	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY & RADIATION PROTECTION			English	Article						alpha particle; Si film; vacancy; specific resistance; free charge carrier; correlation; regression	HARDNESS	This paper deals with the analysis of correlation and regression between the parameters of particle ionizing radiation and the stability characteristics of the irradiated monocrystalline silicon film. Based on the presented theoretical model of correlation and linear regression between two random variables, numeric and real experiments were performed. In the numeric experiment, a simulation of the effect of alpha radiation on a thin layer of monocrystalline silicon was performed by observing a number of vacancies along the film depth resulting from a single incident alpha particle. In the real experiment, the irradiation of a thin silicon film by alpha particles from a radioactive Am-241 alpha emitter was performed. The observed values of radiation effect on the Si film were specific resistance and the concentration of free charge carriers. The results showed a fme concordance between numeric and real experiments. Correlation verification of the observed values was presented by linear regression functions.

Average values of the activity concentration of radionuclides, outdoor terrestrial gamma dose rate, annual effective dose equivalent and radiation hazard indices from soil activity were estimated. The activity concentrations of Th-232 and average outdoor terrestrial gamma dose rate were found to be higher than the world average, possibly affecting the Western Ghats environment in general. Therefore, radiological risks to the general population from ionizing radiation from the naturally occurring radionuclides in the soil are considered to be significant. However, other radiological hazard indices were found to be within permissible limits.	[Manigandan, P. K.] Sai Nath Univ, Dept Phys, Ranchi, Jharkhand, India; [Shekar, B.

CESIUM REMOVAL FROM AQUEOUS SOLUTION BY NATURAL MINERAL CLINOPTILOLITE	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY & RADIATION PROTECTION			English	Article						clinoptilolite; adsorption; cesium; natural radioactivity; phase transformation; differential thermal analysis	ZEOLITE-A; FLY-ASH; ADSORPTION; MORDENITE; CHABAZITE; WATERS; CS-137; BLEND; IONS	The aim of this study was to investigate the Cs+ ions sorption on natural minerals clinoptilolite. The analysis of clinoptilolite and clinoptilolite with adsorbed Cs+ ion was conducted by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray fluorescence, and gamma spectrometry. The specific activity of naturally occurring radionuclides in clinoptilolite was determined by gamma spectrometry by using the HPGe semiconductor detector. Obtained activity concentrations ranged from 49 Bq/kg to 810 Bq/kg for K-40, 5.7 Bq/kg to 10 Bq/kg for U-238, 5.8 Bq/kg to 70 Bq/kg for Th-232(Ac-228), and the presence of artificial radionuclides was not detected (Cs-137 < 0.02 Bq/kg). The study of the thermal decomposition of raw clinoptilolite and Cs adsorbed clinoptilolite by differential thermal analysis is presented in this paper. The activation energy of the reaction phase transformation of raw clinoptilolite is 156.7 kJ/mol, while Cs adsorbed clinoptilolite is 121.7 kJ/mol. The lower value of activation energy reaction of the phase transformation Cs adsorbed clinoptilolite indicates that Cs which is adsorbed destabilizes the crystal structure of clinoptilolite and thus facilitates the transition to the amorphous state.

Identification of possible incidents or accidents is the key element in radiological assessment and prevention. As major incident it was considered a fire burst that occurred during the progress of the clean-up operations. The postulated incident has, as a consequence, thick smoke generation from the burned radioactive material and the dispersion of this material in the environment through the technological ventilation system and the evacuation chimney. From the performed analysis it can be seen that in the case of an incident to the reactor hot cells, an operator engaged in intervention operations could take an effective dose of 5.29 Sv per event, coming from both external and internal exposure. Such an incident, if it happens, would be classified of level 3 on the INES scale.

However, the question remains as to whether FISH provides valid estimates of cumulative red bone marrow radiation doses in cases of incorporation of radionuclides or combined external and internal exposures. This question has arisen in connection with the interpretation of results of dose assessments for epidemiological studies of plutonium workers at the Russian Mayak plant and of members of the public exposed to strontium radioisotopes and external radiation as a result of discharges from Mayak to the Techa River. Exposures to penetrating external radiation result in fairly uniform irradiation of body tissues, and hence similar doses to all tissues, for which FISH dosimetry can provide a reliable measure of this whole body dose. However, intakes of radionuclides into the body by inhalation or ingestion may result in retention in specific organs and tissues, so that the distribution of dose is highly heterogeneous. For radionuclides emitting short-range radiations (e.g. alpha particles), this heterogeneity can apply to dose delivery within tissues and between cells within tissues. In this paper, an attempt is made to address the question of what FISH measures in such circumstances by considering evidence regarding the origin and lifetime dynamics of lymphocyte subsets in the human body in relation to the localised delivery of dose from the internal emitters Sr-90 and Pu-239, which are of particular interest for the Southern Urals Mayak and Techa River populations, and for which most evidence is available in these populations. It is concluded that the FISH translocation assay can be usefully applied for detecting internal and combined external gamma and internal doses from internally deposited Sr-90, albeit with fairly large uncertainties. The same may be true of Pu-239, as well as other radionuclides, although much work remains to be done to establish dose-response relationships.

Analysis was conducted at the Urals Research Center for Radiation Medicine, Public Health England and Leiden University Medical Center. Each laboratory scored 1000 cells per donor, which resulted in similar to 1000 genome equivalents (GE) per donor. The age-dependent spontaneous level of translocations for each donor was evaluated on the basis of data published by Sigurdson et al. (International study of factors affecting human chromosome. Mutat. Res. 2008;652:112-121). Reconstruction of doses was performed with the 'Techa River Dosimetry System' developed in 2009. In the studied donors, the range of individual cumulated RBM dose was from 0.3 to 3.7 Gy. Analysis of the yield of stable translocations dependent on the individual RBM dose from Sr-89,Sr-90 showed a linear dose-response relationship of 0.007 +/- 0.002 translocation/GE cell/Gy (R = 0.61, p = 0.001). This set of results was in a good agreement with the previous data reported for 18 donors by Vozilova et al. (Preliminary FISH-based assessment of external dose for residents exposed on the Techa River. Radiat. Res. 2012;177:84-91).

Purification of Regenerated Uranium Hexafluoride in a Cascade with Intermediate Withdrawal	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								A scheme for purifying regenerated uranium hexafluoride in the intermediate withdrawal in a cascade where low-enrichment uranium is produced from natural uranium in the main withdrawal is examined. It is shown that U-232,U-234,U-236 removal can be accomplished by feeding regenerated uranium hexafluoride into the step minimizing the total feed flow over all steps or into the first waste step of the cascade. Low-enrichment uranium satisfying ASTM C 996-10 specifications for commercial uranium can be efficiently produced from the purified product obtained in the intermediate withdrawal. The low-enrichment uranium obtained directly in the intermediate withdrawal as well as the product present in the main withdrawal produced from slightly contaminated natural uranium also meet these specifications.

The effect of burn up on the kinetic parameters for a pressurized water reactor fueled by MOX using MCNPX code	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article								Reactor kinetic parameters are very important for safety analysis in power reactors. This paper focused on calculations of kinetic parameters such as the effective delayed neutron fraction (beta(eff)), the neutron generation time (Lambda) and the prompt neutron lifetime l(p) for PWR. In this paper the burn-up calculations were performed to calculate kinetic parameters as a function of burn-up for a PWR when fueled with standard UO2 fuel and MOX (Mixed-Oxide) fuel in order to study the impact of burn-up on these parameters. The calculations were performed using the Monte Carlo code MCNPX The core chosen for the simulation is based on a 4-loop Westinghouse PWR power plant. The calculations were performed from beginning of the life to the end of life 210 days and compared with safety values taken from the design control document of an AP1000 PWR. The results are in agreement for UO2 but not for MOX until end of cycle (EOC).

Improvement of passive shielding to reduce background components to determinate radioactivity at low energy gamma rays	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article							PB-210	This paper describes a new system that has the ability to reduce background components to apply for environmental studies. This system uses gamma spectrometry with semi-empirical self absorption correction and practical method for routine measurements of the mass activity radionuclides at low energy such as Pb-210 (46.5 keV), Th-234 (63.3 keV) and Ra-226 (186.2 keV). The reliability and precision of proficiency test must pass for final scores all the analytical determinations of received "acceptable" for all radionuclides. Our work shows an experiment developed for the calculation of self-absorption correction in that case that the sample's chemical composition is unknown.	[Thanh, T. T.; Loan, T. T. H.; Nhon, M.

Detector Performance Characterization for High Sensitivity Single-Photon Imaging	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Gamma-ray detectors; medical imaging; nuclear imaging; spect	SMALL ANIMAL SPECT; SCINTILLATOR ARRAYS; GAMMA-CAMERA; MANGANESE; CADMIUM; READOUT; MATRIX; SYSTEM; PET	We are developing detectors for an un-collimated scanner for very high sensitivity single-photon imaging. The scanner consists of two large, thin, closely spaced, pixelated scintillation detectors of either thallium-doped sodium iodide (NaI(Tl)), sodium-doped cesium iodide (CsI(Na)), or bismuth germanate (BGO). The scintillator arrays are interchangeable to optimize performance for a wide range of isotope energies and imaging subjects. For each scintillator, flood histograms were obtained utilizing test gamma sources: Cd-109, Am-241, Co-57, Ba-133, Cs-137, Na-22, and beta source Si-32. Using a 3 mm thick 21 x 41 NaI(Tl) pixelated array (2 mm x 2 mm pixels on a 2.2 mm pitch), read out by two adjacent Hamamatasu H8500 multi-channel photomultiplier tubes (MCPMTs), the energy resolution for Co-57 was 12.2% over the center of the MCPMTs and 45.3% for pixels over the gap, with flood histogram peak-to-valley ratios >6.1 for the center of the MCPMTs and >4.2 for the gap between the two MCPMTs. The NaI(Tl) detector consistently produced peak-to-valley ratios of >1.6 in the center of the MCPMTs for all radioisotopes studied. CsI(Na) and BGO detectors had flood histograms of similar quality to NaI(Tl) at intermediate to high-energies, allowing for optimal imaging across a wide energy range. The measured sensitivity for point sources placed 10 mm from the detector approached 35% for low-energy isotopes and all scintillator materials, which results in an expected system sensitivity (two opposing detectors) of similar to 70% for these isotopes. The 5 mm thick BGO arrays had the greatest efficiency for high-energy isotopes due to the increased stopping power of this material. The measured spatial resolution for Tc-99m for the CsI(Na) detector (1.6 mm pitch) was 7.5 mm FWHM at the aluminum entrance window (1.5 mm from scintillator face), decreasing to 15 mm at a distance of 5 mm from the scintillator face. The NaI(Tl) detector showed similar spatial resolution. This spatial resolution is sufficient for imaging well-localized radiotracer distributions in thin objects, and the very high sensitivity can be used for fast dynamic imaging, or imaging using very low injected doses.

We report on a temporal anomaly detection algorithm which uses mobile detectors to build a spatial map of background spectra, allowing sensitive detection of any anomalies through many days or months of monitoring. We adapt previously-developed anomaly detection methods, which compare spectral shape rather than count rate, to function with limited background data, allowing sensitive detection of small changes in spectral shape from day to day. To demonstrate this technique we collected daily observations over the period of six weeks on a 0.33 square mile research campus and performed source injection simulations.

The system comprises four detectors and a multiplexed analyzer for the real-time parallel processing of fast neutron events. The function of the real-time, digital multiple-channel pulse-shape discrimination analyzer is described together with the results of laboratory-based measurements with Cf-252, Am-241-Li and plutonium. The analyzer is based on a single-board solution with integrated high-voltage supplies and graphical user interface. It has been developed to meet the requirements of nuclear materials assay of relevance to safeguards and security. Data are presented for the real-time coincidence assay of plutonium in terms of doubles count rate versus mass. This includes an assessment of the limiting mass uncertainty for coincidence assay based on a 100 s measurement period and samples in the range 0-50 g. Measurements of count rate versus order of multiplicity for Cf-252 and Am-241-Li and combinations of both are also presented.	[Joyce, Malcolm J.; Gamage, Kelum A.

Previous fault-tolerant approaches have proposed run-time reconfiguration to regain the lost functionality. We worked with a similar strategy to overcome failures caused by unidirectional SEUs occurring simultaneously in both frontline and redundant modules, but the approach we propose in this paper not only improves reliability but also requires low-overhead as compared to previous methodologies. The proposed architecture is an array of computation tiles containing computation cells and corresponding hot-spares. Each computation tile has a separate region for spare cells. The simultaneous faults are handled by an on-chip fault-tolerant core and external host software that partially reconfigure the spare-cells region of a computation tile. The proposed architecture is implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA device and verified with the aid of simple digital application. Compared to previous schemes, our approach requires up to 9.6x less area overhead while providing 57.6% more reliability to mask multiple unidirectional SEUs.

The results show that even if the alpha emissivity produced by the thorium decay chain is initially acceptable, it can increase significantly during the device lifetime. Three radionuclides in the thorium chain are responsible for the increase: Th-232, Th-228 and (228)RA. Their initial concentrations determine the evolution of the emissivity during the device lifetime.	[Kaouache, A.; Wrobel, F.; Saigne, F.; Touboul, A.

Radon exposure at a radioactive waste storage facility	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article						radon; solid-state nuclear track detectors; waste	TRACK DETECTORS	The Waste Management Department of Nuclear and Energy Research Institute (IPEN) is responsible for the safety management of the waste generated at all internal research centers and that of other waste producers such as industry, medical facilities, and universities in Brazil. These waste materials, after treatment, are placed in an interim storage facility. Among them are Ra-226 needles used in radiotherapy, siliceous cake arising from conversion processes, and several other classes of waste from the nuclear fuel cycle, which contain Ra-226 producing Rn-222 gas daughter. In order to estimate the effective dose for workers due to radon inhalation, the radon concentration at the storage facility has been assessed within this study. Radon measurements have been carried out through the passive method with solid-state nuclear track detectors (CR-39) over a period of nine months, changing detectors every month in order to determine the long-term average levels of indoor radon concentrations. The radon concentration results, covering the period from June 2012 to March 2013, varied from 0.55 +/- 0.05 to 5 : 19 +/- 0 : 45 kBq m(-3). The effective dose due to Rn-222 inhalation was further assessed following ICRP Publication 65.	[Manocchi, F. H.; Campos, M. P.; Dellamano, J. C.; Silva, G.

Evidence for age-related performance degradation of Am-241 foil sources commonly used in UK schools	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article						radioactivity; foil sources; americium-241; americium		The characteristics of alpha radiation have for decades been demonstrated in UK schools using small sealed Am-241 sources. There is a small but steady number of schools who report a considerable reduction in the alpha count rate detected by an end-window GM detector compared with when the source was new. This cannot be explained by incorrect apparatus or set-up, foil surface contamination, or degradation of the GM detector. The University of Liverpool and CLEAPSS collaborated to research the cause of this performance degradation. The aim was to find what was causing the performance degradation and the ramifications for both the useful and safe service life of the sources. The research shows that these foil sources have greater energy straggling with a corresponding reduction in spectral peak energy. A likely cause for this increase in straggling is a significant diffusion of the metals over time. There was no evidence to suggest the foils have become unsafe, but precautionary checks should be made on old sources.	[Whitcher, R.] CLEAPSS, Uxbridge UB8 3PQ, Middx, England; [Page, R.

Proposed biokinetic model for phosphorus	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article						phosphorus; biokinetics; workers	RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES; P-32; ABSORPTION; EXCRETION; RADIOPHOSPHORUS; METABOLISM; LEUKEMIA; TISSUES; CA-45; RATS	This paper reviews data related to the biokinetics of phosphorus in the human body and proposes a biokinetic model for systemic phosphorus for use in updated International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) guidance on occupational intake of radionuclides. Compared with the ICRP's current occupational model for systemic phosphorus (Publication 68, 1994), the proposed model provides a more realistic description of the paths of movement of phosphorus in the body and greater consistency with experimental, medical, and environmental data regarding its time-dependent distribution. For acute uptake of P-32 to blood, the proposed model yields roughly a 50% decrease in dose estimates for bone surface and red marrow and a six-fold increase in estimates for liver and kidney compared with the model of Publication 68. For acute uptake of P-33 to blood, the proposed model yields roughly a 50% increase in dose estimates for bone surface and red marrow and a seven-fold increase in estimates for liver and kidney compared with the model of Publication 68.

Quantification of the activity of tritium produced during the routine synthesis of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose for positron emission tomography	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article						cyclotron; FDG; PET; radioactive waste; tritium	IMPURITIES; CYCLOTRON	Gamma emitting radioactive by-products generated during the cyclotron irradiation of O-18 labelled water by protons to produce (18)FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) for positron emission tomography are well characterised. However, the production of tritium (H-3) through the O-18(p, t)O-16 nuclear reaction has not been investigated in detail. The aim of this study was to measure tritium activity produced during a large number of (18)FDG production runs in order to obtain a better perspective on its impact on radioactive waste management, particularly as regards storage and disposal. Tritium was assayed by liquid scintillation counting in recovered O-18 water from 24 separate production runs. The mean (SD) values of activity and activity concentration were 170 (20) kBq and 81 (8) kBq ml(-1) respectively. Both quantities were positively correlated with the activity of F-18. Tritium was detected in much lower concentration in water used to rinse the target vessel. The activity of tritium is such that it is exempt from regulatory control and may be combined with bulk non-active waste for disposal as Very Low Level Waste. However, variations in the irradiation conditions or the procedures for the collection of recovered water might result in its classification as Low Level Waste, necessitating a more complex disposal regime.

However, systematic discrepancies were observed for the predictions of the activity concentrations in urine samples. In the present work, modifications to the model were investigated with the aim of improving the agreement between model predictions and data. It turned out that the disagreement for the urine data was ascribable to the mathematical simplifications used by the ICRP to describe urinary excretion in the first few days after delivery. However, the predictive performances of the model remained unchanged even when differences in the bioavailability of caesium from the ingested food types were considered or metabolic interactions between caesium and potassium were introduced into the model formulation.

J	Grimston, M; Nuttall, WJ; Vaughan, G				Grimston, Malcolm; Nuttall, William J.; Vaughan, Geoff			The siting of UK nuclear reactors	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Review						nuclear installations; siting; safety; history; economics		Choosing a suitable site for a nuclear power station requires the consideration and balancing of several factors. Some 'physical' site characteristics, such as the local climate and the potential for seismic activity, will be generic to all reactors designs, while others, such as the availability of cooling water, the area of land required and geological conditions capable of sustaining the weight of the reactor and other buildings will to an extent be dependent on the particular design of reactor chosen (or alternatively the reactor design chosen may to an extent be dependent on the characteristics of an available site). However, one particularly interesting tension is a human and demographic one. On the one hand it is beneficial to place nuclear stations close to centres of population, to reduce transmission losses and other costs (including to the local environment) of transporting electricity over large distances from generator to consumer. On the other it is advantageous to place nuclear stations some distance away from such population centres in order to minimise the potential human consequences of a major release of radioactive materials in the (extremely unlikely) event of a major nuclear accident, not only in terms of direct exposure but also concerning the management of emergency planning, notably evacuation. This paper considers the emergence of policies aimed at managing this tension in the UK. In the first phase of nuclear development (roughly speaking 1945-1965) there was a highly cautious attitude, with installations being placed in remote rural locations with very low population density. The second phase (1965- 1985) saw a more relaxed approach, allowing the development of AGR nuclear power stations (which with concrete pressure vessels were regarded as significantly safer) closer to population centres (in 'semi-urban' locations, notably at Hartlepool and Heysham). In the third phase (1985- 2005) there was very little new nuclear development, Sizewell B (the first and so far only PWR power reactor in the UK) being colocated with an early Magnox station on the rural Suffolk coast. Renewed interest in nuclear new build from 2005 onward led to a number of sites being identified for new reactors before 2025, all having previously hosted nuclear stations and including the semi-urban locations of the 1960s and 1970s. Finally, some speculative comments are made as to what a 'fifth phase' starting in 2025 might look like.

The use of nuclear prospecting measurements for characterizing the radioactive status of Al-Bayyarat and Sabkhet Mouh areas, southern Palmyrides, Syria	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article						Sabkhet Mouh; Radium salt; Disequilibrium; Spectrometry measurements		Al-Bayyarat and Sabkhet Mouh areas in southern Palmyride have been radioactively characterized by using different nuclear prospecting measurements. Those measurements include the application of airborne, carborne spectrometric gamma, radon emanation and borehole techniques. The merging of airborne, carborne spectrometric gamma data enables to establish the normalized eU, eTh, and K% maps in the study area. Radon emanation and spectrometric gamma measurements have been applied only in Al- Bayyarat area, where radioactive anomalous zone has been observed. The radioactive characteristics of the study area has been explained through studying and analyzing a profile of 30 Km long, where a plausible geo-radioactive model has been proposed for the uranium leaching and its transport.

J	Dizdaroglu, M				Dizdaroglu, Miral			Clemens von Sonntag and the early history of radiation-induced sugar damage in DNA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION BIOLOGY			English	Review						DNA damage; free radicals; radiation chemistry	ELECTRON SPIN RESONANCE; SATURATED AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; INDUCED STRAND BREAKAGE; GAMMA-IRRADIATED DNA; ALKALI-LABILE SITE; OH RADICAL ATTACK; END GROUPS; D-GLUCOSE; DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC-ACID; PHOSPHATE ELIMINATION	Purpose : This article reviews the early history of ionizing radiation-induced sugar damage in DNA in dedication to Prof. Clemens von Sonntag, who recently passed away. It covers the time between 1968 and 1978, during which most of the work on the ionizing radiation-induced damage to polyalcohols, carbohydrates and the 2'-deoxyribose moiety in DNA was performed. Methodologies using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were developed to identify and quantify the radiation-induced products that had previously remained elusive. Products were identified by GC-MS either directly or after reduction of samples with NaBH4 or NaBD4. Incorporation of deuterium atoms by NaBD4-reduction facilitated the identification of aldehyde, keto, carboxyl and deoxy groups in the molecules. Numerous products of a polyalcohol and carbohydrates were identified and quantified. Mechanisms of product formation were proposed. Several products of the 2'-deoxyribose moiety in DNA were identified, indicating that they were released from DNA strand, not bound to it. Alkali labile sites and products still remaining within DNA or bound to DNA as end groups were also elucidated by first reducing irradiated samples with NaBD4 followed by alkali treatment and GC-MS analysis. Conclusion : The knowledge of the products of the 2'-deoxyribose moiety in DNA led to the first mechanistic understanding of various pathways of hydroxyl radical-induced DNA strand breakage. To this date, some of these mechanisms still remain the most-widely studied mechanisms of DNA damage. Prof. von Sonntag's contributions to the understanding of the radiation chemistry of carbohydrates and DNA helped shape this field of science for years to come.

Melting point determination of uranium nitride and uranium plutonium nitride: A laser heating study	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							INTERNATIONAL TEMPERATURE SCALE; THERMOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES; PHASE EQUILIBRIA; NITROGEN SYSTEM; MONONITRIDE; DIOXIDE; PRESSURE	Understanding of the behaviour of nuclear material in extreme conditions is essential for the analyses of the operation limits of nuclear fuels, and prediction of possible nuclear reaction accidents. In this context, the high temperature behaviour of uranium nitride and mixed uranium-plutonium nitrides has been studied in the present work by laser heating under controlled atmosphere coupled with fast multi-wavelength pyrometry. Such an approach has allowed performing a thermal arrest analysis and establishing the solid-liquid phase boundaries in the investigated compositions, whereby non-congruent vaporisation was avoided by setting a suitable nitrogen overpressure. In addition, the normal spectral emissivities of the current samples were determined by radiance spectroscopy. Besides revealing a slightly more metallic optical behaviour in plutonium-containing compositions, this latter characterisation led to the determination of the real melting/solidification temperatures of the investigated nitrides. It is confirmed that UN melts congruently at (3120 +/- 30) K in a nitrogen pressure of 0.25 MPa (2.5 bar). The melting/solidification temperatures decrease in plutonium containing samples, reaching (3045 +/- 25) K for x(PuN) = 0.2, a composition of interest for potential applications of this material as a nuclear fuel. Besides their fundamental importance, the current results are useful for a deeper understanding of the nitride fuel behaviour under accidental conditions, whereby uncontrolled thermal excursions might occur in the nuclear reactor core.

Thermodynamic assessment of the Th-U-Pu system	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							THORIUM SYSTEM; ZR SYSTEMS	Thermodynamic assessments of the Th-U and Th-Pu binary systems are performed in this study according to CALPHAD method and together with the data on the U-Pu system, which has been already published in the literature, the Th-U-Pu ternary system is determined. All available experimental data from the literature were used for the binary system assessments and based on them the Gibbs energy properties of the unknown phases have been optimized. For the excess Gibbs energy of the liquid phase the ionic liquid model has been used, whereas for solid solutions the Redlich-Kister description was selected. In case of the Th-U and Th-Pu binary systems a very good agreement between the assessment and the experimental equilibrium data has been achieved, with 80% of equilibrium data reproduced within +/- 20 K.

The microstructural characterization of the as-cast and homogenized alloy (heat treated in gamma phase region and then quenched in water), as well as the deformed state, was performed using optical and electron microscopy techniques, hardness testing and X-ray diffraction, employing the Rietveld method. The as-cast microsegregation was qualitatively observed by optical microscopy whereas the quantitative evaluation was obtained by electronprobe micro-analysis (EPMA). The homogenization state of the structure was evaluated after heat treatment at 1000 degrees C in a tube furnace for 5 h. It was found that this treatment is effective in eliminate dendritic segregation in this alloy. The texture of the Mulberry alloy was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in the gamma-phase stabilized condition and deformed state (rolled at room temperature). The stabilized gamma alloy showed moderate texture mainly on the components (0 2 3)< 1 0 0 > and (0 3 2)< 1 0 0 >. After 80% deformation, the sample showed a fiber texture (0 01)< u vw >, not commonly found in BCC metals, besides the gamma fiber (1 1 1)(u vw) with intermediate intensity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
