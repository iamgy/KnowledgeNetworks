J	Ferrari, F; Peerani, P				Ferrari, Francesca; Peerani, Paolo			Performance of an active well coincidence counter for HEU samples	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article						Neutron detectors; Neutron coincidence counting; Nuclear safeguards; Calibration of neutron counters		Neutron coincidence counting is the reference NDA technique used in nuclear safeguards to measure the mass of nuclear material in samples. For high-enriched uranium (HEU) samples active neutron interrogation is generally performed and the most common device used by nuclear inspectors is the Active Well Coincidence Counter (AWCC). Within her master thesis at the Polytechnic of Milan, the first author performed an intensive study on the characteristics and performances of the AWCC in order to assess the (235)U mass in HEU oxide samples at the PERLA laboratory of JRC. The work has been summarised in this paper that starts with the optimisation of the use of AWCC for nuclear safeguards, describing the calibration procedure, reporting results of a series of verification measurements, summarising the performances that can be obtained with this instruments during inspections at fuel production plants and concluding with the discussion of uncertainties related to these measurements.

The symmetrical structure of the twin-type ionization chamber was effective in the improvement of the ratio of signal to noise in the measurement of pulses induced by alpha-rays. Outdoor alpha-ray measurement was well performed with this ionization chamber by applying sufficiently high bias voltage to the electrodes, except for at very high humidity conditions. It was confirmed that the declination of the counting efficiency due to wetting was easily recovered by the dry-up of the inside of the chamber. Alpha-radioactivity from radon and other alpha-emitting radionuclide in atmosphere was satisfactorily monitored by the detector. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Indoor radon measurements in a Greek city located in the vicinity of lignite-fired power plants	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article						Indoor radon; Passive detectors; Lignite-fired power plants; Effective dose; Greece	NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY MEASUREMENTS; SEASONAL-VARIATIONS; BUILDING-MATERIALS; RESIDENTIAL RADON; LUNG-CANCER; DWELLINGS; MEGALOPOLIS; HOUSES; PELOPONNESE; EXHALATION	This work presents indoor radon measurements in 42 dwellings in the city of Megalopolis, Southern Greece, located in the vicinity of 2 lignite-fired power plants and examines the effect of season, floor level and age of the dwellings on indoor radon concentration. The radon measurements have been carried out using the LR-115, type II and CR-39 alpha track detectors in "closed-can" geometry. The average annual indoor radon concentration (GM) was found to be 52 Bq m(-3), which is well below the recommended action level of the European Union. This value corresponds to an annual effective dose to the population of 1.3 +/- 0.4 mSv. Season and age of the examined dwellings represent factors that affected significantly the indoor radon in Megalopolis, while the effect of floor level appeared to be not significant. Radium activity concentration values, measured by gamma-ray spectrometry in 20 sub-samples of six soil cores (60-135 cm depth), collected from the surrounding area of the city, were found to be consistent with the Greek and world average values. Based on the results of this study, it is concluded that the effect of the lignite-fired power plants on indoor radon concentration in Megalopolis' dwellings was not significant.

Monte Carlo modelling of TRIGA research reactor	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						2-MW TRIGA MARK II research reactor; MCNP5; ENDF/B-VI.8; ENDF/B-VII.0; JEFF-3.1; JENDL-3.3	NUCLEAR-DATA LIBRARY; BENCHMARK ANALYSIS; FUEL	The Moroccan 2 MW TRIGA MARK II research reactor at Centre des Etudes Nucleaires de la Maamora (CENM) achieved initial criticality on May 2, 2007. The reactor is designed to effectively implement the various fields of basic nuclear research, manpower training, and production of radioisotopes for their use in agriculture, industry, and medicine. This study deals with the neutronic analysis of the 2-MW TRIGA MARK II research reactor at CENM and validation of the results by comparisons with the experimental, operational, and available final safety analysis report (FSAR) values. The study was prepared in collaboration between the Laboratory of Radiation and Nuclear Systems (ERSN-LMR) from Faculty of Sciences of Tetuan (Morocco) and CENM. The 3-D continuous energy Monte Carlo code MCNP (version 5) was used to develop a versatile and accurate full model of the TRIGA core. The model represents in detailed all components of the core with literally no physical approximation. Continuous energy cross-section data from the more recent nuclear data evaluations (ENDF/B-V1.8, ENDF/B-VII.0, JEFF-3.1, and JENDL-3.3) as well as S(alpha, beta) thermal neutron scattering functions distributed with the MCNP code were used. The cross-section libraries were generated by using the NJOY99 system updated to its more recent patch file "up259". The consistency and accuracy of both the Monte Carlo simulation and neutron transport physics were established by benchmarking the TRIGA experiments. Core excess reactivity, total and integral control rods worth as well as power peaking factors were used in the validation process. Results of calculations are analysed and discussed.

Natural radioactivity and associated dose rates in soil samples from Kalpakkam, South India	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							GAMMA-RAY SPECTROMETRY; SAND SAMPLES; RADIONUCLIDES; GROUNDWATER; TURKEY	The activity concentration of naturally occurring radioactive elements such as (226)Ra, (232)Th and (40)K were measured for 46 soil samples collected in the vicinity of the Madras atomic power station, Kalpakkam, South India using gamma-ray spectroscopy. The average activity concentration of (226)Ra, (232)Th and (40)K in soil samples were found to be 22.6 +/- 12.6, 92.8 +/- 44.3 and 434.1 +/- 131.1 Bq kg(-1), respectively. The activity concentration of natural radionuclides is higher than the world average except for (226)Ra. The external absorbed gamma dose rates due to (226)Ra, (232)Th and (40)K are observed to be 74.6 +/- 30.8 nGy h(-1) with a corresponding annual effective dose of 91.5 +/- 37.8 mu Sv y(-1), which are also above the world average. The values of radium equivalent activity and external hazard index are less than the world average.

Assessment of radiation dose for surrounding organs and persons approaching implanted patients upon brachytherapy of prostate cancer with Iridium-192	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								To assess a proper dose for radiation therapy fitting the typical physical characteristics of male Korean bodies, a mathematical phantom was prepared based on standard Korean male measurements. Upon brachytherapy of prostate cancer by implanting (192)Ir into the prostate gland (the source organ), the absorbed dose of the prostate gland and surrounding organs and the expected dose of people within the vicinity were assessed. (192)Ir, which has been the radionuclide of choice for prostate cancer brachytherapy, was selected for the simulation. It was assumed that 1 Ci of initial radioactivity would be administered. As a result, 1.28E-02 Gy/Ci was exhibited in the prostate gland of the source organ, and the dose to which persons within the vicinity were exposed was exhibited to be 9.19E-06 Sv at a distance of 30 cm from the front.

Assessment of gamma-emitting radionuclides in sediment cores from the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							NATURAL RADIONUCLIDES; ANTHROPOGENIC RADIONUCLIDES; BUILDING-MATERIALS; BOTTOM SEDIMENTS; ORGANIC-CARBON; JORDAN GULF; HONG-KONG; RADIOACTIVITY; POLLUTION; COAST	The Gulf of Aqaba is the only seaport in Jordan which currently has intense activities such as industrial development, phosphate ore exportation, oil importation, shipping, commercial and sport fishing. Most of these activities, especially the phosphate ore exportation, could cause serious radiological effects to the marine environment. Thus, it is essential to investigate the level of the radioactivity concentrations to establish a baseline database, which is not available yet in the Gulf of Aqaba. Radioactivity concentrations of gamma-emitting radionuclides in core and beach sediments of the Gulf of Aqaba were investigated. Core sediments were collected from five representative locations for three different water column depths (5, 15 and 35 m). The results showed that the activity concentrations of (238)U, (235)U and (226)Ra for both seafloor and beach sediments from the phosphate loading berth (PLB) location to be higher than those from other investigated locations and more than twice as high as the worldwide average; the (238)U activity concentration was found to vary from 57 to 677 Bq kg(-1). The results also showed that there is little variation of radioactivity concentrations within the core length of 15 cm. The calculated mean values of the radium equivalent activity Ra(eq), the external hazard index, H(ex), the absorbed dose rate and the annual effective dose for the beach sediment in PLB location were 626 Bq kg(-1), 1.69, 263 nGy h(-1) and 614 mu Sv y(-1), respectively. These values are much higher than the recommended limits that impose potential health risks to the workers in this location. As for other studied locations, the corresponding values were far below the maximum recommended limit and lies within the worldwide range.

The cause of the incident was an orphaned source from a lightning rod. The dose received by individuals was assessed using a retrospective dosimetry technique, based on the information on behaviour of individuals and results of dose rate measurements in the vicinity of the source. Several people have been exposed to relatively high dose rates for an extended period of time. The conservatively estimated cumulative dose values for two categories of individuals were 50 and 40 mSv, respectively, which are significantly higher than annual dose limit for public exposure of 1 mSv. The need to identify radioactive sources incorporated in radioactive lightning rods, to maintain control and accountability and to remove and dispose of them properly along with appropriate record keeping in Serbia was highlighted. These activities would reduce the probability of occurrence of radiation incidents in Serbia.

Thoron and decay products, beyond UNSCEAR 2006 Annex E	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Workshop on Environmental Thoron and Related Issues	MAY 19-22, 2010	Chiba, JAPAN	Natl Inst Radiolog Sci (NIRS)			DOSE CONVERSION FACTORS; RESIDENTIAL RADON; LUNG-CANCER	Uranium and thorium series radionuclides are present in all soils and rocks. Thus, radon and thoron, the radioactive noble gases originating in the uranium (U-238) and thorium (Th-232) decay chains is ubiquitous and everyone is exposed to both radon and thoron gases and their particulate radioactive decay products. As described in UNSCEAR Annex E (2006), radon and its decay products have been recognised for many years as a hazard to underground miners. More recently, the risks from exposure to residential radon have been demonstrated through residential case-control epidemiological studies. However, as discussed by UNSCEAR, exposures to thoron and its decay products have often been relatively ignored. Moreover, unlike radon the effects of exposure to thoron and its decay products are not available from epidemiology and thus, a dosimetric approach is required to assess risks. UNSCEAR continues to recommend the use of a dose conversion factor for thoron decay products of 40 nSv (Bq h m(-3))(-1). UNSCEAR Annex E suggests there is an emerging problem, namely, that the contribution of Rn-220 (thoron) gas to the Rn-222 (radon) gas measurement signal is not well known. Until recently, this has largely been ignored. This is an important consideration as measurements at work and homes are the basis for investigating lung cancer exposure-response relationships. Based on UNSCEAR Annex E, this paper provides an overview of the sources and levels of thoron and its associated decay products at home and work. In addition, this paper provides an overview of the thoron dosimetry considered by UNSCEAR Annex E and some recent results.

Deposition-based progeny concentration measurement techniques (direct thoron progeny sensors, DTPSs) appear to be best suited for radiological risk assessments among both occupational workers and general populations. The DTPSs lodged in wire-mesh and filter paper-integrated sampler and operated in flow mode can be used to measure the unattached and attached fractions. The wire-mesh-capped DTPS system can be used to measure the deposition velocity of the unattached and attached fractions separately. In the present work, the DTPSs in different modes have been described and the experiments for measuring the multiple parameters related to the indoor thoron progeny are presented.

Experience in using radon and thoron data to solve environmental and water problems	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Workshop on Environmental Thoron and Related Issues	MAY 19-22, 2010	Chiba, JAPAN	Natl Inst Radiolog Sci (NIRS)			CONTINUOUS MONITOR; COASTAL OCEAN; THAILAND; RN-222	This study aims to introduce thoron ((220)Rn), a naturally occurring isotope, as a new groundwater tracer for detecting groundwater seepage into Bangkok canals. Previous studies by the group using radioactive radon ((222)Rn) and conductivity as groundwater tracers suggested that there is shallow groundwater seeping into the man-made canals ('klongs') around Bangkok. Furthermore, the groundwater was shown to be an important pathway of nutrient contamination to the surface waters. Thoron is a member of the natural (232)Th decay chain, has exactly the same chemical properties as radon, but has a much shorter half-life (56 s) than radon (3.84 d). By using its advantage of rapid decay, if one detects thoron in the environment, there must be a source nearby. Thus, thoron is potentially an excellent prospecting tool. In the case of measurements in natural waters, sources of thoron should indicate the point of groundwater discharges more precisely than radon. During the surveys in the canals of Bangkok, thoron was successfully measured and its distribution was more variable than that of radon, suggesting that seepage into the canals is not uniform.

A comparative study of thorium activity in NORM and high background radiation area	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Workshop on Environmental Thoron and Related Issues	MAY 19-22, 2010	Chiba, JAPAN	Natl Inst Radiolog Sci (NIRS)			BEACH PLACER; RADIOACTIVITY; MONAZITE; URANIUM; ORISSA; INDIA	Several industrial processes are known to enrich naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM). To assess such processes with respect to their radiological relevance, characteristic parameters describing this enrichment will lead to interesting information useful to UNSCEAR. In case of mineral treatment plants, the high temperatures used in smelting and refining processes lead to high concentrations of (238)U and (232)Th. Also due to thermal power combustion, concentration of U and Th in the fly ash increases manifold. NORM samples were collected from a Thailand mineral treatment plant and Philippine coal-fired thermal power plants for investigation. Some studies are initiated from a high background radiation area near Gopalpur of Orissa state in India. These NORM samples were analysed by gamma-ray spectrometry as well as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The radioactivity in case of Orissa soil samples is found to be mainly contributed from thorium. This study attempts to evaluate levels of thorium activity in NORM samples.	[Sahoo, S.

Gamma-ray dose rate originating from external sources and (222)Rn and (226)Ra contents of spring-water from a mine was also measured. During working hours RnDP and TnDP concentration values changed between 12.1-175 and 0.14-0.42 Bq m(-3), respectively. The (222)Rn and (226)Ra concentration values in the karst spring-water were similar to 6 Bq dm(-3) and 16 mBq dm(-3), respectively. The radiation dose resulting from the consumption of karst spring-water was negligible. The doses from the inhalation of TnDP and external gamma radiation were of the same magnitude, similar to 0.1 mSv y(-1), which was rather negligible related to the estimated radiation dose of 5 mSv y(-1) from RnDP.

The release of thoron gas from the mining and milling of thorite, monazite and other major thorium ores has been recognised as a potential radiological health hazard. For precise measurements, calibration is a very important factor. This paper describes a cheap and easy way of producing a stable thoron source made of thorium nitrate packed in a porous clay mineral matrix used as (220)Rn generator. The source should have a small spherical shape and be fired at 600 degrees C; this will lead to a great pore volume, necessary for the thoron gas. High importance should be given to the water uptake. The exhalation power of (220)Rn was measured using a Lucas scintillation cell. Experimental efficiency values obtained ranged between 0.16 and 1.44 %.

Because the time-integrated radon progeny monitor developed by the authors has the function to detect (212)Po, time-integrated monitoring of thoron progeny concentration is also available with the monitor. Assuming that contribution of (216)Po is negligible, equilibrium equivalent concentration of thoron (EECTn) is theoretically calculated from the etch-pit counts by (212)Po. The annual averages of EECTn observed in the investigation area were about 0.2 Bq m(-3), and they had no remarkable differences from one another.

Impact of industries in the accumulation of radionuclides in the lower part of Ebro river (Catalonia, Spain)	RADIOPROTECTION			English	Article						Ebro River; natural and artificial radionuclides; biota samples; water	DICALCIUM PHOSPHATE; DRINKING-WATER; RADIOACTIVITY; PLANT; TRITIUM	Ebro River extends over almost 930 km and is the main Spanish river entering the Mediterranean Sea. There are several industries located along this river course including a dicalcium phosphate factory (DCP) and two nuclear power reactors. These installations, together with other factors such as the geology, can contribute to the radiological content of the river. Therefore, this study was performed to determine some natural and also some anthropogenic radionuclide concentrations in the Ebro River ecosystem. We analysed water samples, solid samples (rice field sludge and surface marine sediment samples), and also biota samples (Cladophora glomerata and Cynodon dactylon). For water samples, gross alpha, gross beta, tritium, uranium, thorium and also a group of gamma-emitting isotopes' activities were determined. The main contribution to radioactivity for these samples was due to some isotopes from the uranium and thorium chain. For the solid samples, we quantified some natural and artificial gamma radioisotopes, which may be related to the geological and/or industrial activities located in this zone. In the case of biota, the results indicate that the presence of the DCP has a significant influence, since the highest activity was observed in the surroundings of this industry (Flix), where isotopes such as Bi-214 and Pb-214 presented activity values of 105 +/- 43 Bq/kg and 100 +/- 8 Bq/kg, respectively.

Indoor radon concentration, outdoor gamma dose rates and impact of geology in the Dhirkot area, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, sub-Himalayas, Pakistan	RADIOPROTECTION			English	Article						Isotope geology; radon; gamma dose rate; environmental radioactivity	PLASTIC TRACK DETECTORS; ENVIRONMENTAL-RADIOACTIVITY; HIMACHAL-PRADESH; INDIA; DWELLINGS; RADIATION; VALLEY; CITY; REGION; TURKEY	The sedimentary sandstone and clay sequence of the Miocene Kamlial and Murree Formations is exposed in the sub-Himalayas of the Dhirkot area, State of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan. The indoor radon and outdoor gamma dose rates were measured from dwellings and basement sandstone and clay rocks, respectively. The radon concentration in dwellings was 36 +/- 14 Bq.m(-3) to 195 +/- 27 Bq.m(-3) with an average of 121 +/- 26 Bq.m(-3). The average radon concentration in pucka, semi-kucha and kucha houses was 124 +/- 25 Bq.m(-3), 143 +/- 25 Bq.m(-3) and 136 +/- 26 Bq.m(-3), respectively. The outdoor gamma dose rates for the basement sandstones and clays of the Murree Formation and Kamlial Formation were 74.0 +/- 1.4-113.1 +/- 2.4 nGy/h and 69.6 +/- 2.2-108.8 +/- 1.4 nGy/h, respectively. The average gamma (lose rates for the Murree and Kamlial Formations were 91.3 +/- 14.3 nGy/h. The gamma dose rate is maximum (113.1 +/- 2.4 nGy/h) and minimum (69.6 +/- 2.2 nGy/h) at higher (5 539 feet) and lower (4 493 feet) altitudes, respectively. The overall causes for the increase in average radon concentration in dwellings of the Dhirkot area were poor ventilation, old houses, humidity and temperature, cracks in houses, geology, and aggregates. The gamma dose rate variation depends on sandstone and clay lithologies, altitude and radionuclide contributions. This study shows that the average radon (121 +/- 26 Bq.m(-3)) concentration for the inhabitants of the Dhirkot area was within the accepted safe health limit (200 Bq.m(-3), ICRP, 1993; UNSCEAR, 1993).

Under these conditions the weight of Li2.0TiO3+y, increased by only 1% in 100 days, which provides evidence for the high chemical stability of Li2TiO3. In comparison, under the same storage conditions the weights of Li2.2TiO3+y and Li2.4TiO3+y, increased by 14% and 18%, respectively. The observed weight gain is attributed to the uptake of water, and to the reaction of a by-product of Li2+xTiO3+y with water and carbon dioxide. The weight gain curves were evaluated by the Jander equation. From the analysis, it was possible to obtain the diffusion coefficient of water through Li2TiO3 particles at ambient temperature. The determined value was 2 x 10(-17) m(2)/s. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

First-principles study on dissolution and diffusion properties of hydrogen in molybdenum	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							SUPERABUNDANT VACANCIES; DEUTERIUM RETENTION; ELECTRON-GAS; METALS; TUNGSTEN; ENERGY; OCCUPANCY; ALGORITHM; RELEASE; ALLOYS	Employing a first-principles method, we have investigated dissolution and diffusion properties of hydrogen (H) in molybdenum (Mo), one of potential candidates for plasma facing materials in a nuclear fusion Tokamak. We show that single H atom is energetically favorable sitting at the tetrahedral interstitial site (TIS) instead of octahedral interstitial site and diagonal interstitial site. This can be confirmed by the electron localization function result. Bader charge analysis suggests that the bonding between H and surrounding Mo is mainly ionic mixed with slight covalent component. Double H atoms tend to be paired up at the two neighboring TIS's along the (1 1 0) direction with the distance of similar to 0.221 nm and the binding energy of 0.03 eV. This suggests a weak attractive interaction between H atoms, with the implication that self-trapping of H and thus formation of the H-2 molecules are quite difficult in an intrinsic Mo environment. We demonstrate that the diffusion barrier of H that jumps between the TIS's is 0.16 eV, and the dissolved concentration of H in the intrinsic fvlo is 2.6 x 10(-8) at a typical temperature of 600 K. The diffusion coefficients of H, D, and T are different due to the different masses, which are calculated to be 1.3 x 10(-7) m(2)/s, 9.2 x 10(-8) m(2)/s, and 7.5 x 10(-8) m(2)/s at 600 K.

J	Kim, KT				Kim, Kyu-Tae			UO2/Zry-4 chemical interaction layers for intact and leak PWR fuel rods	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							CLADDING BONDING LAYER; MOLTEN ZIRCALOY-4; DISSOLUTION; 2500-DEGREES-C; UO2	In this study, the UO2 pellet-Zry-4 cladding interfaces of intact and leak PWR fuel rods were examined with the help of an optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope to investigate typical chemical interaction layers formed at the pellet-cladding interface during the normal reactor operations. The two intact and two leak fuel rods with the burnup of between 35,000 and 53,000 MWD/MTU were selected to evaluate the effects of gap-gas compositions and fuel burnup on the chemical interaction layer formation. Based on the optical and scanning electron micrographs, it is found that the intact fuel rod generates apparently one interaction layer of (U,Zr)O2-x at the interface, whereas the leak fuel rod generates apparently two interaction layers of ZrO2-x and (U.Zr)O2-x. These interaction layers for the intact and leak fuel rods were predicted by several diffusion paths drawn on a U-Zr-O ternary phase diagram. The variations of chemical element compositions around the interface of one intact rod were generated by an electron probe micro-analyzer to confirm the interaction layers at the pellet-cladding interface. The interaction layer growth rates of the ZrO2-x and (U,Zr)O2-x phases were estimated, using the layer thicknesses and the reaction times. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Separation of strontium from low level radioactive waste solutions using hydrous manganese dioxide composite materials	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							NITRIC-ACID MEDIUM; ADSORPTION; EXTRACTION; EXCHANGE; SORPTION; MIXTURE; IONS	(90)Sr is one of the major isotopes present in the low level radioactive liquid waste (LLW) generated during operation of nuclear reactors and spent fuel reprocessing plants. A composite ion exchange material consisting of hydrous manganese oxide and poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) was developed for removal of strontium from aqueous radioactive waste. The prepared composite material showed very good strontium adsorption properties in aqueous solutions. Sorption of strontium on the composite material as a function of pH, equilibration time and strontium ion concentrations were studied. The process of sorption of strontium from solution was analysed using different isotherm models like Langmuir, D-R and Freundlich. Four different error functions were employed to find out the most suitable isotherm model to represent the experimental data and it was found that Freundlich model best fits the sorption of strontium on the composite material. Analysis of the data obtained from the sorption kinetics studies showed that the data fitted better to the pseudo-second order kinetic model. Lab scale column performance study of the composite material revealed that the material could be effectively used in column operations to remove strontium from LLW solutions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This material is considered for this purpose as a mixture of bitumen and crystals of sodium nitrate. For BWP, both bitumen and crystals contribute to the creep deformations. In this study, an attempt is made to develop an elasto-viscoplastic model that describes the creep behaviour of BWP considering the constituents' creep behaviour. An experimental program has been set up to get insight in the material response. The elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model has been implemented into a finite element program. The modelling results have been compared with the experimental data. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Bilodid, I; Mittag, S				Bilodid, I.; Mittag, S.			Use of the local Pu-239 concentration as an indicator of burnup spectral history in DYN3D	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Cross-section library; History effects; Spectral history; Burnup; DYN3D		Codes for reactor core calculations use few-group cross sections (XS) which depend on local burnup, given in terms of the energy produced per fuel mass (MWd/kgHM). However, a certain burnup value can be reached under different spectral conditions depending on moderator density and other local parameters. Neglecting these spectral effects, i.e. applying the summary-burnup value only, can cause considerable errors in the calculated power density. This paper describes a way to take into account spectral-history effects. It is shown that the respective XS correction linearly depends on the actual Pu-239 concentration. The applicability of the method was proved not only for usual uranium oxide fuel, but also for mixed uranium/plutonium oxide (MOX) and fuel assemblies with burnable absorber. The code DYN3D was extended by new subroutines which calculate the actual distribution of Pu-239 in the core and apply a spectral-history correction for the XS. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The use of WIMS and CITATION codes in fuel loading required for the conversion of HEU MNSR core to LEU	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						21 Specific nuclear reactors and associated plants; Performance testing; Reactivity insertions; Steady-state conditions; WIMS and CITATION; Neutronics parameters	NEUTRON SOURCE REACTORS; MINIATURE	The Nigerian Research Reactor-1 (NIRR-1) falls in the category of Miniature Neutron Source Reactors (MNSR) using a fuel of 90% HEU. It is therefore desirable to convert it from this enrichment to LEU (less than 20%) in conformity with the new global trend of making research reactor fuel as unattractive as possible to groups that may be interested in using such highly enriched cores for non-peaceful purposes. In this work, we have developed a computational scheme based on WIMS and CITATION that would theoretically achieve this objective as easily as possible. The scheme systematically reduces the enrichment from 90% (or any other initial values) to less than 20% in steps of 5% or any desired percentage variation. Two fuel types (UAI(4) and UO(2)) are considered in here, while maintaining the size and geometry of the core as well as the excess reactivity (between 3.5 and 4 mk). Our results show that the U-235 loading increases sharply as enrichment decreases. It has also been noticed that at 5% enrichment the fuel loading for both types is 2505 g. However, at 90% enrichment, the loading drops sharply to 998 g for UAI(4) fuel and 946 g for UO(2) fuel. Below the enrichment of 5%, the operation of NIRR-1 with both fuel types can be considered unrealistic as this requires structural adjustment which the work tries to maintain constant.

J	Jeong, CJ; Ko, WI				Jeong, Chang Joon; Ko, Won Il			A sensitivity study on fast reactor scenarios with various conversion ratios	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Fast reactor scenario; Conversion ratio; Once-through fuel cycle; Spent fuel; Transuranic element; Long-term heat	FUEL-CYCLE	Korean fast reactor scenarios have been analyzed for various kinds of conversion ratios by the DANESS system dynamic analysis code. The once-through fuel cycle analysis was modeled based on the Korean "National Energy Basic Plan" up to 2030 and a postulated nuclear demand growth rate until 2150. The fast reactor scenario analysis has been performed for three kinds of conversion ratios such as 0.3, 0.61, and 1.0. Through the calculations, the nuclear reactor deployment scenario, front-end cycle, back-end cycle, and long-term heat load have been investigated. From the once-through results, it is shown that the nuclear power demand would be similar to 70 GWe, and the total amount of the spent fuel accumulated by 2150 would be similar to 168,000 t. Also, the fast reactor scenario analysis results show that the spent fuel inventory and out-pile transuranic element can be reduced by increasing the fast reactor conversion ratio. Furthermore, the long-term heat load of spent fuel decreases with an increase in the conversion ratio. However, it is known that the deployment of a fast reactor of a low conversion ratio does not reduce much the spent fuel and out-pile transuranic element inventory due to the fast reactor deployment limitation which is related to the availability of transuranic elements.

Fluorination of UF4 in a mini-tapered fluidized bed and mathematical modeling	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Uranium tetrafluoride; Mini-tapered fluidized bed reactor; Two-phase flow structure; Reactor simulation	URANIUM TETRAFLUORIDE; REACTOR; 2-PHASE; KINETICS	A mini-tapered fluidized bed reactor can be used for fluorination reaction of UF4 to produce uranium hexafluoride. By adopting the mini-tapered bed the problems associated with fluidization in a cylindrical bed such as entrainment of particles and the limitation of operating velocity can be overcome, consequently the performance of the reactor can be enhanced. Simulation of the reactor was performed employing two-phase models, bubble phase with piston flow and emulsion phase with piston (D.P-P model) or perfectly mixed flow (D.P-M model). The voidage of the emulsion and bubble phases were estimated from the distribution two-phase structure hydrodynamic model. The model predictions have been compared with the results from a pilot-scale experiment. The D.P-P model gives good agreement between computed and empirical results. The effects of various parameters on the reactor performance are discussed using the model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Khani, M.

An alternative radiometric method for calculating the sedimentation rates: Application to an intertidal region (SW of Spain)	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Radionuclide (137)Cs; Sedimentation rate; Climate change; Dating of sediment columns	CYLINDRICAL GEOMETRY; ACCUMULATION RATES; MUDDY SEDIMENTS; LAKE-SEDIMENTS; PB-210; BAY; CS-137; CADIZ; RADIONUCLIDES; FLUXES	A new method using the inventory determined for the activity of the radionuclide (137)Cs, coming from global radioactive fallout has been utilised to calculate the sedimentation rates. The method has been applied in a wide intertidal region in the Bay of Cadiz Natural Park (SW Spain). The sedimentation rates estimated by the (137)Cs inventory method ranged from 0.26 cm/year to 1.72 cm/year. The average value of the sedimentation rate obtained is 0.59 cm/year, and this rate has been compared with those resulting from the application of the (210)Pb dating technique. A good agreement between the two procedures has been found. From the study carried out, it has been possible for the first time, to draw a map of sedimentation rates for this zone where numerous physico-chemical, oceanographic and ecological studies converge, since it is situated in a region of great environmental interest. This area, which is representative of common environmental coastal scenarios, is particularly sensitive to perturbations related to climate change, and the results of the study will allow to make short and medium term evaluations of this change.

Effective separation method of Cu-64 from Ga-67 waste product with a solvent extraction and chromatography	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Cu-64 radionuclide; Chemical separation; Solvent extraction		A simple chemical process with a solvent extraction was investigated as an effective separation method for Cu-64 radionuclide from waste production, which is collected as solution after extracting Ga-67 and recovering Zn-68 target materials. For the production of radionuclide Ga-67, the enriched Zn-68 material electroplated on Cu backing plate is usually exposed to energetic protons. The protons produce Ga-67 including other radionuclides, such as Ni-57, Co-57.55, Cu-64.67 by several nuclear reactions. After extracting Ga-67 and recovering Zn-68 through several steps of chemical processes, the residual solution is usually discarded even though it contains other species of radioisotopes. In this study, a simple chemical process having a high separation efficiency of Cu-64 from the waste solution was investigated. With this method, a promising radiotracer as a diagnostic in PET and a therapeutic in radio-immunotherapy, Cu-64 was estimated to be produced as high as 1,200 mCi at EOB within 3 h chemical processing after extraction of Ga-67 and Zn-68.

J	Iwai, Y; Yamanishi, T				Iwai, Yasunori; Yamanishi, Toshihiko			Development of tritiated vapor absorbent applicable to the atmospheric detritiation system in a nuclear facility	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Detritiation; Adsorption; Desorption; Zeolite; Silica-to-alumina ratio	TRITIUM CONFINEMENT; FRAMEWORK SILICA; ALUMINA RATIO; WATER-VAPOR; PERFORMANCE; ADSORPTION; OPERATION; ZEOLITES; POROSITY; DRYER	The combination of hydrogen oxidation reactor packed noble metal catalysts and water vapor absorber has been applied to the atmospheric detritiation system of the tritium handling facility. Commercial synthetic zeolite such as molecular sieve 5A has been used as an adsorbent of ADS absorber. In the case of application of molecular sieve 5A to the ADS absorber of a large-scale tritium handling facility such as a future fusion plant, an absorber becomes huge due mainly to the difficulty in dehydration from molecular sieve 5A. Hence, application of CaY Faujasite-type zeolite with a high framework silica-to-alumina ratio to the adsorbent for atmospheric detritiation system was investigated. It was clear that the dehydration behavior at room temperature was significantly improved using CaY zeolite. In contrast, detritiation factor for CaY zeolite with a high framework silica-to-alumina ratio depended strongly on the space velocity through the absorber. To apply CaY zeolite with a high framework SiO(2)/Al(2)O(3) ratio to the ADS absorbent, the space velocity less than 250h(-1) was recommended to maintain the detritiation factor more than 1000. The steep increase in water adsorption at the relative pressure lower than 0.05 is a feature of synthetic zeolite with calcium cation. However, such an increase was not observed in water adsorption on CaY zeolite with a framework SiO(2)/Al(2)O(3) ratio more than 7.0. Consequently, the CaY zeolite with the framework SiO(2)/Al(2)O(3) ratio of 5.0 is a promising candidate as absorbent of ADS absorber. Copyright (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, to be successful, radioactivity from the pancreas must not be obscured by the background radioactivity in the abdomen. Pretargeting offers the promise of achieving high target organ to normal tissue ratios. In preparation for pancreas imaging studies by pretargeting using morpholino oligomers (MORF/cMORF), it was necessary to develop a simple and efficient method to radiolabel the cMORF effector. Because we have shown that labeling the cMORF with In-111 via DTPA reduces excretion into the intestines compared to labeling with Tc-99m via MAG(3), the conjugation of DTPA to cMORF was investigated for In-111 labeling. The amine-derivatized cMORF was conjugated with DTPA using 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) as an alternative to the conventional cyclic anhydride. The conjugation efficiency (represented by the number of DTPA groups attached per cMORF) was investigated by changing the EDC, DTPA, and cMORF molar ratios. Different open columns were considered for the purification of DTPA-cMORF. Before conjugation, each cMORF molecule was confirmed to have an amine by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) assay using the to-amino butyric acid as positive standard and the non-amine derivatized cMORF as negative standard. The average number of DTPA groups per cMORF was 0.15-0.20 following the conjugation over a cMORF/DIPA molar ratio of 0.5-5 and over a cMORF/EDC molar ratio of 20-60. The conjugation efficiency was lower than expected probably due to steric hindrance. A 1 x 50 cm P-4 column using ammonium acetate as eluting buffer provided an adequate separation of DTPA-cMORF from free DTPA. The In-111 labeling efficiency by transchelation from acetate exceeded 95%, thus avoiding the need for postlabeling purification. Despite the lower than expected conjugation efficiency in which no more than one-fifth of the cMORF were DTPA-derivatized, a specific radioactivity of at least 300 mu Ci/mu g or 1.90 Ci/mu mol of cMORF was achieved. In conclusion, a protocol is described for In-111-DTPA-cMORF that provides the high specific activity favorable to beta cell imaging because of the low mass fraction of beta cells in pancreas (1-2%) and obviates the need for postlabeling purification.

Characterization of radioactive particles using non-destructive alpha spectrometry	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Alpha spectrometry; Radioactive particle; Spectrum unfolding; Plutonium; Uranium	SIMULATION	Spherical particles with known properties were used to demonstrate and test a novel software package known as AASIFIT, which is able to unfold complex alpha spectra. A unique feature of the program is that it uses simulated peak shapes in the fitting process. The experimental reference particles in the testing were artificially produced U particles of diameter 1.4 mu m and a nuclear bomb particle with a twenty-fold greater diameter, mainly composed of U and Pu dioxides. AASIFIT was used to determine the density of the U particles. In addition, the activities of (239+240)Pu and (241)Am were determined for the nuclear bomb particle and compared to earlier determinations in the literature. The results of this investigation demonstrated that the software can be used to estimate the properties of particles emitting alpha radiation. However, the composition and geometry of the investigated particles need to be known with good accuracy for reliable estimates. Furthermore, uncertainties in the stopping power data, especially for U and Pu, may have an influence on the results obtained from the software. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Some geological characteristics in a regolith-limey shale rock profile through natural radionuclides distribution	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Gamma ray; Rocks; Soils; Geological characteristics; Environmental radiation	SEDIMENTS; BRAZIL; BASIN	The objective of this work is to study some geological characteristics in a regolith-rock profile by analyzing the distribution of natural radionuclides along the profile by high resolution gamma ray spectrometry. The concentrations of radionuclides reflect some mineralogical characteristics of the rock matrix and also more recent events, such as weathering and erosion. The samples were collected in an abandoned limestone mine, in the city of Sapopema, Parana State, Brazil. The stratigraphy is represented by an alternation of decimetric limestone layers, bituminous shale and some rhythmite layers. The ratios eTh/K obtained for all samples of the studied profile have equivalent values, indicating similar mineralogical characteristics of their detritic components. The ratio eTh/eU corroborates the fact that regolith samples belong to a much more oxidized environment, favoring the leaching of uranium. These results show that the measurement of radionuclide distribution in rocks and soils may be an important tool for the analysis of geological characteristics, such as mineralogy and oxidizing conditions.

Many of these contexts are such that first responders and responsible authorities may be faced with isotopes and activities that present significant challenges with respect to identification and quantification using gamma ray spectrometry. The MALRAD international exercise was designed to provide a practice opportunity for authorities and laboratories to work with synthetic gamma-spectrometric data generated in response to seven hypothetical scenarios involving radioactive materials. Scenarios were based as far as practical upon earlier events and participants had one week to provide as much information as possible about the sources based on the provided data. Results indicate that in cases of single isotopes, irrespective of the detector type involved, all participants were in a position to identify sources and provide estimates of activity. For situations involving shielded sources or special nuclear materials most participants were in a position to provide indications as to what the sources were but only a few participants were in a position to provide detailed information.

A recent validation study has demonstrated a good performance of the implemented simulation approach for modelling realistic gamma-spectra from shielded and unshielded point-like sources. In the present work this approach has been further tested with the use of a 0.2 kg voluminous 4.46 wt% enriched uranium reference material and a portable 10% HPGe detector. The simulations for shielded and unshielded measurement conditions revealed a good agreement with the experimentally acquired gamma-spectra, both for the detection efficiency values and for the overall spectrum shape and intensity in the energy range up to 2.6 MeV.

The new method, called deviation display, uses a modified waterfall display to present relative changes in spectral data over energy and time. Using unshielded (137)Cs and (241)Am point sources and different natural background environments, the behaviour of the deviation displays is demonstrated and analysed for two standard detector types (NaI(TI) and HPGe). The deviation display enhances positive significant changes while suppressing the natural background fluctuations. After an initialisation time of about 10 min this technique leads to a homogeneous display dominated by the background colour, where even small changes in spectral data are easy to discover. As this paper shows, the deviation display method works well for all tested gamma energies and natural background radiation levels and with both tested detector systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis results will serve as additional information to the expanded baseline data for Malaysia's marine environment. Thirty locations from extended study area were identified in the EEZ from which large volumes of surface seawater samples were collected. Different co-precipitation techniques were employed to concentrate cesium and plutonium separately. A known amount of Cs-134 and Pu-242 tracers were used as yield determinant. The precipitate slurry was collected and oven dried at 60 degrees C for 1-2 days. Cesium precipitate was fine-ground and counted using gamma-ray spectrometry system at 661.62 keV, while plutonium was separated from other radionuclides using anion exchange, electrodeposited and counted using alpha spectrometry. The activity concentrations of Cs-137 and Pu239+240 were in the range of 3.40-5.89 Bq/m(3) and 2.3-7.9 mBq/m(3), respectively. The Pu239+240/Cs-137 ratios indicate that there are no new inputs of these radionuclides into the area. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is then of key importance to understand the sources of environmental radioxenon to be able to distinguish civil sources from those of a nuclear explosion. Based on several years of measurements, combined with advanced atmospheric transport model results, it was recently shown that the main source of radioxenon observations are strong and regular batch releases from a very limited number of medical isotope production facilities. This paper reviews production processes in different medical isotope facilities during which radioxenon is produced. Radioxenon activity concentrations and isotopic compositions are calculated for six large facilities. The results are compared with calculated signals from nuclear explosions. Further, the outcome is compared and found to be consistent with radioxenon measurements recently performed in and around three of these facilities. Some anomalies in measurements in which (131m)Xe was detected were found and a possible explanation is proposed. It was also calculated that the dose rate of the releases is well below regulatory values. Based on these results, it should be possible to better understand, interpret and verify signals measured in the noble gas measurement systems in the International Monitoring of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.

With both high and low level tritium samples, glass vials allow higher counting rates than plastic vials do. We also present detailed analysis of the way to obtain the optimal counting condition by dispensing different quantity of cocktail into sample vials. Results indicate that the optimal counting condition has little relationship with tritium concentration in the sample. The main factor which influences the counting is the quantity of cocktail added into samples. Figure of merit is employed to access the results, which increases as the quantity of cocktail increasing. But when the ratio of cocktail and sample reaches 2.0, increase of ratio makes little contribution to the counts, and the disintegrations per minute comes nearly to be a constant.

INTERACTION OF URANIUM-MOLYBDENUM FUEL WITH AN ALUMINUM MATRIX WITH DEEP BURNUP	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								A thermodynamic analysis is used to calculate the phase and component composition of uranium-molybdenum fuel with burnup 200 GW.days/ton. The equilibrium composition of the gas phase, consisting mainly of gaseous cesium whose pressure reaches 30 kPa, is determined more accurately. The quantitative composition of the phase of solid solutions of tellurides, whose formation degrades the structure of a fuel granule, is presented. Thermal tests of the fuel composition (U-Mo)-Al were performed. The investigation was performed in the presence of simulators of the chemically active fission products of cesium and iodine at different temperature. The interaction zone of (U-Mo)-Al is investigated by means of metallography and scanning electron microscopy. The data obtained on the composition of the indicated zone made it possible to conjecture the character of interaction between the fuel material and the aluminum matrix.	[Baranov, V. G.; Nechaev, V.

The purpose of this paper is to present the radon exposure related cancer mortality risk based on 20,920 deaths, 2 million person-years, and 6,373 cancers. The latter include 3,016 lung cancers and 3,053 extrapulmonary solid cancers. Internal Poisson regression was used to estimate the excess relative risk (ERR) per unit of cumulative radon exposure in Working Level Months (WLM) for all major sites and for the follow-up period from 1946 to 2003. The simple cohort ERR WLM-1 for lung cancer is 0.20% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17%; 0.22%]. The ERR model for lung cancer is linear in radon exposure with exponential effect modifiers that depend on age at median exposure, time since median exposure, and radon exposure-rate. In this model the central estimate of ERR WLM-1 is 1.06% (95% CI: 0.69%; 1.42%) for an age at median exposure of 33 y, a time since median exposure of 11 y, and an exposure-rate of 2.7 WL. This central ERR decreases by 5% for each unit exposure-rate increase. The ERR decreases by 32% with each decade increase in age at median exposure and also decreases by 54% with each decade increase in time since median exposure. The ERR WLM-1 for all extrapulmonary solid cancers combined without effect modification is 0.014% (95% CI: 0.006%; 0.023%). The ERR model for extrapulmonary solid cancer is linear in radon exposure with an exponential effect modifier which depends on age-attained. In this model the central estimate of ERR WLM-1 is 0.040% (95% CI: -0.001%; 0.082%) for an age-attained of 44. The ERR decreases by 37% with each decade increase in age-attained. The highest ERR WLM-1, after lung, is observed for cancers of the pharynx (0.16%), tongue/mouth (0.045%), and liver (0.04%).

Two thousand seven hundred and nine male workers employed at the AREVA NC uranium processing plant between 1960 and 2005 in France were included in the cohort. Historical exposure to reprocessed uranium compounds classified by their solubility type was assessed on the basis of the plant's specific job-exposure matrix. Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for attained age, calendar period, and socioeconomic status were used to estimate relative risks in regards of each type of uranium compound. The relative risk of lung cancer tended to increase with decreasing solubility of reprocessed uranium compounds. The highest-though not statistically significant-relative risk was observed among workers exposed to slowly soluble reprocessed uranium dioxide. This study is the first suggesting an increasing risk of lung cancer associated with exposure to reprocessed uranium. Our results are consistent with data from experimental studies of biokinetics and the action mechanism of slowly soluble uranium compounds, but need to be confirmed in larger studies with more detailed dose-response analyses.

However, little is known about the induction of leukemia by radiation exposure in mines. Moreover, miners usually have occupational medical checkup programs that include chest x-ray examinations. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to re-examine leukemia risk among miners, taking into account exposure to x rays for diagnostic purposes. The data used were from a previously analyzed individually matched case-control study of former uranium miners in East Germany with 377 cases and 980 controls. Additionally, data on x-ray examinations were taken from medical records for most of the subjects. Finally, the absorbed dose to red bone marrow was calculated considering both occupational and diagnostic exposures. Using conditional logistic regression models, a moderately but not statistically significant elevated risk was seen in the dose category above 200 mGy for the combined dose from both sources [odds ratio (OR) = 1.33, 90% confidence interval (CI): (0.82-2.14)]. Ignoring the dose accumulated in the recent 20 y, the risk in the highest dose category (> 105 mGy) was higher [OR = 1.77, 90% CI: (1.06-2.95)]. Ignoring diagnostic exposure yielded similar results. For the highest dose category (absorbed dose lagged by 20 y) the risk was more than doubled [OR = 2.64, 90% CI: (1.60-4.35)].

For MOX fuels, the risk of lung cancer development may be different from that assigned to individual components (plutonium, uranium) given different physico-chemical characteristics. The objective of this study was to investigate late effects in rat lungs following inhalation of MOX aerosols of similar particle size containing 2.5 or 7.1% plutonium. Conscious rats were exposed to MOX aerosols and kept for their entire lifespan. Different initial lung burdens (ILBs) were obtained using different amounts of MOX. Lung total alpha activity was determined by external counting and at autopsy for total lung dose calculation. Fixed lung tissue was used for anatomopathological, autoradiographical, and immunohistochemical analyses. Inhalation of MOX at ILBs ranging from 1-20 kBq resulted in lung pathologies (90% of rats) including fibrosis (70%) and malignant lung tumors (45%). High ILBs (4-20 kBq) resulted in reduced survival time (N = 102; p < 0.05) frequently associated with lung fibrosis. Malignant tumor incidence increased linearly with dose (up to 60 Gy) with a risk of 1-1.6% Gy(-1) for MOX, similar to results for industrial plutonium oxide alone (1.9% Gy(-1)). Staining with antibodies against Surfactant Protein-C, Thyroid Transcription Factor-1, or Oct-4 showed differential labeling of tumor types.

Years later, the purpose of the present follow-up study was to reassess the dose-response relationship for lung cancer in the (PuO2)-Pu-239 dogs compared to controls-with particular focus on the dose-response at relatively low lung doses. A (PuO2)-Pu-239 aerosol (2.3 mu m activity-median aerodynamic diameter, 1.9 mu m geometric standard deviation) was administered to six groups of 20 young (18-mo-old) beagle dogs (10 males and 10 females) by inhalation at six different activity levels, as previously described in Laboratory reports. Control dogs were sham-exposed. In dose level 1, initial pulmonary lung depositions were 130 +/- 48 Bq (3.5 +/- 1.3 nCi), corresponding to 1 Bq g(-1) lung tissue (0.029 +/- 0.001 nCi g(-1)). Groups 2 through 6 received initial lung depositions (mean values) of 760, 2,724, 10,345, 37,900, and 200,000 Bq (22, 79, 300, 1,100, and 5,800 nCi) (PuO2)-Pu-239, respectively. For each dog, the absorbed dose to lungs was calculated from the initial lung burden and the final lung burden at time of death and lung mass, assuming a single, long-term retention function. Insoluble plutonium oxide exhibited long retention times in the lungs. Increased dose-dependent mortality due to lung cancer (bronchiolar-alveolar carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and epidermoid carcinoma) and radiation pneumonitis (in the highest exposure group) were observed in dogs exposed to (PuO2)-Pu-239. Calculated lung doses ranged from a few cGy (lowest exposure level) to 7,764 cGy in dogs that experienced early deaths from radiation pneumonitis. Data were regrouped by lifetime lung dose and plotted as a function of lung tumor incidence. The lung tumor incidence in controls and zero-dose exposed dogs was 18% (5/28). However, no lung tumors were observed in 16 dogs with the lowest lung doses (8 to 22 cGy, mean 14.4 +/- 7.6 cGy), and only one lung tumor was observed in the next 10 dogs with lung doses ranging from 27 to 48 cGy (mean 37.5 +/- 10.9 cGy). By least-squares analysis, a pure-quadratic function represented the overall dose-response (n = 137, r = 0.96) with no apparent dose-related threshold. Reducing this function to three linear dose-response components, we calculated risk coefficients for each. However, the incidence of lung tumors at zero dose was significantly greater than the incidence at low dose ( at the p <= 0.053 confidence level), suggesting a protective effect ( radiation homeostasis) of alpha-particle radiation from (PuO2)-Pu-239. If a threshold for lung cancer incidence exists, it will be observed in the range 15 to 40 cGy.

Male and female F344 rats were exposed briefly by nasal inhalation to relatively insoluble aerosols of (CeO2)-Ce-144 or (PuO2)-Pu-239 to achieve a range of four lung burdens. The mean lifetime beta doses to the lung were 3.6 +/- 1.3 Gy, 6.8 +/- 1.7 Gy, 12 +/- 4.5 Gy, and 37 +/- 5.9 Gy. The mean lifetime alpha doses to the lung were 0.06 +/- 0.03 Gy, 0.95 +/- 0.46 Gy, 3.7 +/- 1.6 Gy, and 12 +/- 2.4 Gy. Additional rats were exposed to fractionated thoracic doses of x rays given on 10 successive working days. The lifetime doses to the lung were 3.3 Gy, 5.7 Gy, 11 Gy, and 38 Gy. Appropriate sham controls were included in each group and all groups were observed for their life spans. Lung neoplasms were found after all exposures, with the incidence increasing with radiation dose. Rats exposed to (PuO2)-Pu-239 had the highest incidence, 94% in the group with a dose of 12 Gy. The incidence in the groups exposed to inhaled (CeO2)-Ce-144 or fractionated thoracic x-irradiation was not significantly different. The incidence of lung tumors in the (PuO2)-Pu-239 groups was 21 times higher than that of the groups exposed to the lower LET radiations. These results support a radiation-weighting factor of 20, as recommended by ICRP 60.

Due to internalization of DU during military operations and the ensuing chronic internal exposure to DU, there are concerns regarding its potential health effects. Preconceptional paternal irradiation has been implicated as a causal factor in childhood cancer and it has been suggested that this paternal exposure to radiation may play a role in the occurrence of leukemia and other cancers to offspring. Similarly, in vivo heavy metal studies have demonstrated that carcinogenic effects can occur in unexposed offspring. Using a transgenic mouse system employing a lambda shuttle vector allowing mutations (in the lacI gene) to be analyzed in vitro, we have investigated the possibility that chronic preconceptional paternal DU exposure can lead to transgenerational transmission of genomic instability. The mutation frequencies in vector recovered from the bone marrow cells of the F1 offspring of male parents exposed to low, medium, and high doses of internalized DU for 7 mo were evaluated and compared to control, tantalum, nickel, and gamma radiation F1 samples. Results demonstrate that as paternal DU-dose increased there was a trend towards higher mutation frequency in vector recovered from the DNA obtained from bone marrow of F1 progeny; medium and high dose DU exposure to P1 fathers resulted in a significant increase in mutation frequency in F1 offspring (3.57 +/- 0.37 and 4.81 +/- 0.43 x 10(-5); p < 0.001) in comparison to control (2.28 +/- 0.31 x 10(-5)). The mutation frequencies from F1 offspring of low dose DU, Ta- or Ni-implanted fathers (2.71 +/- 0.35, 2.38 +/- 0.35, and 2.93 +/- 0.39 x 10(-5), respectively) were not significantly different than control levels (2.28 +/- 0.31 x 10(-5)). Offspring from Co-60 (4 Gy) irradiated fathers did demonstrate an increased lacI mutation frequency (4.69 +/- 0.48 x 10(-5)) as had been shown previously. To evaluate the role of radiation involved in the observed DU effects, males were exposed to equal concentrations (50 mg U L-1) of either enriched uranium or DU in their drinking water for 2 mo prior to breeding. A comparison of these offspring indicated that there was a specific-activity dependent increase in offspring bone marrow mutation frequency. Taken together these uranyl nitrate data support earlier results in other model systems showing that radiation can play a role in DU-induced biological effects in vitro. However, since the lacI mutation model measures point mutations and cannot measure large deletions that are characteristic of radiation damage, the role of DU chemical effects in the observed offspring mutation frequency increase may also be significant. Regardless of the question of DU-radiation vs. DU-chemical effects, the data indicate that there exists a route for transgenerational transmission of factor(s) leading to genomic instability in F1 progeny from DU-exposed fathers.

ISOTOPIC AND ELEMENTAL COMPOSITION OF PLUTONIUM/AMERICIUM OXIDES INFLUENCE PULMONARY AND EXTRA-PULMONARY DISTRIBUTION AFTER INHALATION IN RATS	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Health Effects of Incorporated Radionuclides	MAY, 2009	Santa Fe, NM			Am-241; biokinetics; inhalation; plutonium	PLUTONIUM OXIDE; MIXED URANIUM; BEAGLE DOG; AMERICIUM; PU-239; LUNG; BIOKINETICS; CLEARANCE; RETENTION; AEROSOL	The biodistribution of plutonium and americium has been studied in a rat model after inhalation of two PuO2 powders in lungs and extra-pulmonary organs from 3 d to 3 mo. The main difference between the two powders was the content of americium (approximately 46% and 4.5% of total alpha activity). The PuO2 with a higher proportion of americium shows an accelerated transfer of activity from lungs to blood as compared to PuO2 with the lower americium content, illustrated by increased urinary excretion and higher bone and liver actinide retention. The total alpha activity measured reflects mostly the americium biological behavior. The activity contained in epithelial lining fluid, recovered in the acellular phase of broncho-alveolar lavages, mainly contains americium, whereas plutonium remains trapped in macrophages. Epithelial lining fluid could represent a transitional pulmonary compartment prior to translocation of actinides to the blood and subsequent deposition in extra-pulmonary retention organs. In addition, differential behaviors of plutonium and americium are also observed between the PuO2 powders with a higher dissolution rate for both plutonium and americium being obtained for the PuO2 with the highest americium content. Our results indicate that the biological behavior of plutonium and americium after translocation into blood differ two-fold: (1) for the two actinides for the same PuO2 aerosol, and (2) for the same actinide from the two different aerosols. These results highlight the importance of considering the specific behavior of each contaminant after accidental pulmonary intake when assessing extra-pulmonary deposits from the level of activity excreted in urine or for therapeutic strategy decisions.

Ingested radionuclides accumulate in specific organs, which are irradiated over a lifelong period. Our aim is to elucidate why the development of malignant tumors requires long-term internal exposure, on the order of decades, despite the fact that irradiation is continuous over this period. Three major factors are considered to be responsible for the long incubation time in carcinogenesis caused by internally deposited alpha-emitters: uneven distribution of radionuclides, limited range of irradiation, and dynamic movement of tumor precursor cells. We hypothesized that target cells susceptible to malignant transformation may undergo one event by alpha particles and may then migrate outside of the range of alpha particles, thereby avoiding immediate induction of successive additional events that would lead to cell death or neoplastic changes. Based on this hypothesis, we further proposed a mathematical model to predict the relationship between dose rate and incubation period of tumors induced by internally deposited alpha-emitters. The function was non-linear and included terms of both direct and indirect radiation effects. It well fitted both human Th-ICC cases and rat Pu-239-induced lung cancer, suggesting that indirect radiation effects are independent from dose rate. The significance of parameters of the model is discussed.
