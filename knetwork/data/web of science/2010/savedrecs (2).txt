INFORMATION-ANALYTICAL SYSTEM FOR TRACKING THE REHABILITATION OF A TEMPORARY STORAGE FACILITY FOR SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL AND RADIOACTIVE WASTES IN THE VILLAGE OF GREMIKHA	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								An information-analytical system for solving various problems facing developers and implementing agencies at all stages of work has been developed at Russian Science Center Kurchatov Institute as part of a project for ecological rehabilitation of a temporary storage site located in the village of Gremikha for nuclear fuel and radioactive wastes. The information-analytical system accumulates all information on the project: technical characteristics of the objects, cartographic information, documentation, and information on the participants of the project, technologies, and equipment. The centralized storage of the initial data and the data obtained from examinations makes its use effective for all participants of the project. Analysis of the stored information and the formation of structured sets of data are necessary for planning further work on the project and choosing concrete design solutions, exchanging information between participants in the work, and providing information to state organs and the public.

METHOD FOR PERFORMING RAPID RADIATION SURVEYS OF THE WATER AREAS AT SHORE BASES OF THE NAVAL FLEET USING SUBMERSIBLE GAMMA SPECTROMETERS	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								A method of performing radiation surveys of the water areas at shore bases of the naval fleet using underwater scintillation gamma spectrometers is presented as an example of work performed in the waters near the temporary storage site for radwastes and spent fuel in Gremikha. This method makes it possible to record in situ from a surface ship as well as underwater manned or unmanned vehicle the content of radionuclides in sea water. In contrast to conventional methods of monitoring the radiation conditions by means of dosimetric surveys and sampling, submersible spectrometric systems make it possible to detect and identify rapidly the source of radioactive contamination in water and bottom deposits and to determine it size, intensity, and isotopic composition. Appropriate software is used to construct from the survey results cartograms of the contamination in the regions examined, identify pathways for radionuclides to enter the waters, and evaluate the total activity of the bottom deposits.

However, very large contaminated areas have presented major problems to this day because of remediation costs. Phytoremediation is a new, emerging, sustainable technique of remediating areas with low heavy-metal contamination. One advantage of phytoremediation is the comparatively low cost of the process, which may make it usable also on large areas with low levels of contamination. Besides extracting and immobilizing metals, respectively, phytoremediation among other things also contributes to improving soil quality in terms of physics, chemistry, and ecology. Consequently, phytoremediation offers a great potential for the future. Research into phytoremediation of an area contaminated by heavy metals and radionuclides is carried out on a site in a former uranium mining district in Eastern Thuringia jointly by the Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, and the Technical University of Dresden in a project funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research. The project serves to promote the introduction of soft, biocompatible methods of long-term remediation and to develop conceptual solutions to the subsequent utilization of contaminated plant residues. Optimizing area management is in the focus of phytoremediation studies.

Findings of the US research needs workshop on the topic of fusion power	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			Fusion power; Fusion nuclear technology; Materials; Tritium; Environment and safety		The US Department of Energy, Office of Fusion Energy Sciences (OFES) conducted a Research Needs Workshop, referred to as ReNeW, in June 2009. The information developed at this workshop will help OFES develop a plan for US fusion research during the ITER era, roughly the next two decades. The workshop was organized in five Themes, one of which was Harnessing Fusion Power (or Fusion Power for short). The top level goal of the Fusion Power Theme was to identify the research needed to develop the knowledge to design and build, with high confidence, robust and reliable systems that can convert fusion products to useful forms of energy in a reactor environment, including a self-sufficient supply of tritium fuel. Each Theme was subsequently subdivided into Panels to address specific topics. The Fusion Power Panel topics were: Fusion Fuel Cycle; Power Extraction; Materials Science; Safety and Environment; and Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Inspectability (RAMI). Here we present the key findings of the Fusion Power Theme. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Meier, W. R.] LLNL, Livermore, CA 94583 USA; [Raffray, A.

The neutronics calculations were performed directly in the CAD model using the DAG-MCNP code that allows preserving the geometrical details. Detailed high-resolution, high-fidelity profiles of the nuclear parameters were generated using fine mesh tallies. These included tritium production, nuclear heating, and radiation damage. The TBM heterogeneity, exact source profile, and inclusion of the surrounding frame and other in-vessel components result in lower TBM nuclear parameters compared to the previous 1-D predictions. This work clearly demonstrates the importance of preserving geometrical details in nuclear analyses of geometrically complex components in fusion systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recovery of hydrogen from gas mixture by an intermediate-temperature type proton conductor	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			Proton conductor; Barium zirconate oxide; Electrochemical hydrogen pump; Tritium recovery; Transport number	PUMP; SRCEO3; OXIDES	The characteristics of electrochemical hydrogen pump using one-end closed tube type BaZr(0.955)Y(0.03)Co(0.015)O(3-u), which has higher proton conductivity among other zirconate series proton conductor at the intermediate temperature, were demonstrated by a direct current method in the temperature range from 623 to 873 K. Under water vapor electrolysis condition, mixed proton and electron-hole conduction were exhibited and proton transport number was decreased less than 0.37. On the other hand, under hydrogen pumping from a mixture gas contained with hydrogen gas, proton transport number has attained more than 0.85. However, not only proton and electron-hole conductions but also oxide-ion conduction was exhibited even at lower temperature below 700 K. Thus, the growth of electrochemical failure induced by oxide ion migration was observed. From the standpoint of high proton transport number and low oxide-ion conduction, a candidate proton conductor for nuclear fusion engineering applications was proposed to compare with hydrogen pump characteristics among the zirconate series proton conductor.

Some factors which would affect the tritium supply and doubling time were considered, such as the tritium fractional burnup in the plasma, tritium breeding ratio (TBR), the residence time of tritium in all subsystems, and tritium decay, etc. The results showed that the minimum tritium supply for startup was sensitive with the tritium fractional burnup in the plasma, but the effect of the TBR could be neglected. The double time for tritium breeding strongly depended on the TBR and the tritium fractional burnup. Based on the model, the analysis results predicted that the required initial minimum tritium supply was similar to 9.9 kg for startup. After one year's operation, the total tritium inventory in fuel cycle system was similar to 33 kg. And the total tritium release into environment was similar to 4 mg, which was much lower than the allow level, i.e. 1 g-T/year. The tritium in fuel storage system would be doubled and could be extracted to supply for the other fusion power reactor's startup after similar to 886 days operation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Disk-type specimens of SS430 were first coated with ZrO(2)/ZrO(2) or ZrO(2)/Al(2)O(3) layers (100 nm) by sol-gel and electrolytic deposition techniques. Then, the phosphate layers were prepared by dip-coating method; the total thickness of coating was 200 nm. The permeation rate of hydrogen was measured at 300-600 degrees C under driving pressure of 0.1 MPa. The Mg or Al phosphate layers provided significant barrier effects, and the permeation reduction factor observed under the present conditions was 200-3000 against that of Pd coated 430 specimen. Further investigation, however, was required to improve the stability at high temperatures. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It has been reported by the present authors that a large amount of hydrogen can be trapped in tungsten deposition layers formed by hydrogen plasma sputtering depending on the experimental condition. In the present study, the influence of oxygen on hydrogen behavior in tungsten deposition layers was investigated. Overall, hydrogen retention increased with increasing oxygen concentration. The tungsten deposition layer containing oxygen of 1.69 as O/W retained hydrogen of 0.70 as H/W, which is larger than the value of H/W (around 0.1) in the deposition layer containing no oxygen. It was observed that some amounts of hydrogen were released as water vapor from the deposition layer in which a large amount of oxygen was detected. A tungsten deposition layer containing a large amount of oxygen was spontaneously flaked off after plasma was turned off. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Vacuum plasma spraying (VPS) tungsten coatings on Cu substrate are being developed in collaboration with Guangzhou Research Institute of Nonferrous Metals (GZRINM) and Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ASSIC). In order to reduce thermal stresses, several kinds of interlayer structures have been considered to be coated on the heat sink before preparing the pure tungsten layer to the final thickness, and the castellation concepts also taken into account. An actively cooled VPS-W/Cu movable limiter (ML) has been tested in HT-7 and a Material and Plasma Evaluation System (MAPES) will be built soon on EAST. High heat flux testing and non-destructive testing are also being studied. Plasma-wall interaction (PWI) issues like recycling and retention of H isotopes in the coatings, surface and bulk modification of the coatings and service life of the plasma-facing material and component (PFMC) are being studied not only on tokamaks but also in laboratories.

A tritium breeding ratio greater than unity is necessary for self-sufficient fueling. To simulate the 14 MeV neutron transport in tritium breeding systems from the D-T fusion reaction, the 3D realistic modeling with Monte Carlo code and the point-wise nuclear data are recommended. Continuous-energy TRIPOLI-4 Monte Carlo transport code has been widely used on the radiation shielding, criticality safety, and fission reactor physics. For supporting the ITER TBM (test blanket module) neutronics study with TRIPOLI-4 code, this paper presents the TRIPOLI-4 simulation of TBR (tritium breeding ratio) for six OKTAVIAN spherical assemblies of Osaka University: Li, Li-C, Pb-Li, Pb-Li-C, Be-Li, and Be-Li-C. It also investigates the impact of nuclear data libraries on TBR calculations from ENDF/B-VI.4, ENDF/B-VII.0, JEFF-3.1, JENDL-3.3, and FENDL-2.1. In general, TRIPOLI-4 produced satisfactory C/E values. Only beryllium of JEFF-3.1 library introduces higher uncertainties. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The DCLL blanket concept has the potential to be a high-performance DEMO blanket design with a projected thermal efficiency of >40%. Reduced activation ferritic/martensitic (RAF/M) steel is used as the structural material. Helium is used to cool the first wall and blanket structure, and the self-cooled Pb-17Li breeder is circulated for power conversion and for tritium extraction. A SiC-based flow channel insert (FCI) is used as an electrical insulator for magnetohydrodynamic pressure drop reduction from the circulating Pb-17Li and as a thermal insulator to separate the high-temperature Pb-17Li (similar to 650-700 degrees C) from the RAF/M structure, which has a corrosion temperature limit of similar to 480 degrees C. The RAF/M material must also operate at temperatures above 350 degrees C but less than 550 degrees C. We are continuing the development of the mechanical design and performing neutronics, structural and thermal hydraulics analyses of the DCLLTBM module. Prototypical FCI structures were fabricated and further attention was paid to MHD effects and the design of the inboard blanket for DEMO. We are also making progress on related R&D needs to address key areas. This paper is a summary report on the progress and results of recent DCLL TBM development activities. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Nuclear design analyses of the helium cooled lithium lead blanket for a fusion power demonstration reactor	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			DEMO; Blanket; Neutronics; Monte Carlo	DEMO; STRATEGY; PLANT; ITER	This work presents nuclear design analyses for a demonstration power reactor (DEMO) employing the HCLL (helium cooled lithium lead) blanket for the tritium breeding and the power production. The related neutronic calculations were performed with the Monte Carlo code MCNP using a dedicated 3D torus sector model of DEMO. The model has been generated by the geometry conversion tool McCad from available CAD models developed in the frame of the European DEMO study for a device with integrated HCLL blanket modules. The nuclear design analyses address the tritium breeding capability, the shielding performance and the nuclear power production taking into account various engineering design parameters. The HCLL type DEMO was shown to provide tritium self-sufficiency with a sufficient high safety margin. The shielding performance was proven to be sufficient to allow the operation of the DEMO power plant over the full-anticipated lifetime. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The potential presence and minimisation of plutonium within the irradiated beryllium in fusion power plants	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			Plutonium production; Uranium impurity; Beryllium; ITER; DEMO-type fusion machines		Beryllium is expected to be one of the materials used in DEMO-type fusion power plants as blanket neutron multiplier for solid breeders and also in ITER as protective layer of plasma facing components. Among the aspects to be considered when dealing with Be a relevant one is its impurities content. One of the impurity reported by manufacturers is uranium, and that could represent a main source of concern, because its irradiation under fusion neutrons will lead to the formation of actinides, such as plutonium. The paper presents a parametric assessment utilizing for beryllium material composition a range of possible U impurity content between 0 and 100 ppm(wt). First Wall neutron wall load ranging from 0.5 to 2.2 MW/m(2) and neutron fluence from 0.5 to 10.5 MW year/m(2) are considered (for ITER and DEMO-type reactor, respectively) to estimate the Pu production. In all those analyses the irradiation scenarios considered are based on a deuterium-tritium plasma. The evaluation have been performed using the EASY-2007 activation code package, with the EAF2007 activation library. An estimate of the Pu production at the end of the ITER fusion machine preliminary operation with deuterium-deuterium plasma is also presented. A preliminary analysis of the regulatory constraints on the maximum Pu production and indications of possible way for its minimisation is presented and discussed in the paper. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A general description of these systems, based on the present baseline, is given in this paper. Of basic importance for the conceptual design of the ancillary systems is the definition of the main interfaces with ITER because of the potential impact not only on their design itself but also on their operation and maintenance strategy. The main interfaces and integration issues in ITER involving the ancillary systems are here described and discussed. Moreover, the most critical future activities and the main milestones, identified to be compliant with the objective to deliver to ITER the European TBS ancillary systems by 2019, are also indicated and discussed in this paper.

Molecular dynamics and dynamic Monte Carlo studies of mixed materials and their impact on plasma wall interactions	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			Plasma wall interaction; Sputtering; Co-deposition; Material mixing; Molecular dynamics simulation; Monte Carlo simulation	DEUTERIUM PLASMAS; CHEMICAL EROSION; BERYLLIUM; CARBON; MITIGATION; DEPOSITION; SIMULATION; TUNGSTEN; IONS	A molecular dynamics technique was used to study the sputtering characteristics of co-deposited carbon (C) and to investigate subsequent effects of introducing beryllium (Be) impurities. Amorphous C layers containing hydrogen (H) with atomic ratios of H/(C + H)<0.3 together with a small amount of Be with ratios of Be/(C + H + Be)<0.06 are produced on top of a tungsten (W). Noncumulative bombardment of the amorphous C layer without H (i.e., H/(C + H) = 0) by H atoms, produces no atomic C sputtering at energies less than the threshold energy for physical sputtering, as calculated by a dynamic Monte Carlo code, EDDY. By examining the H uptake in the layer, it was observed that hydrocarbon sputtering occurs when the dominant emitted species are small radicals e.g. CH and at low H/(C + H) ratios (<0.1). When the ratio was increased, larger radicals (CH(2) and CH(3)) were emitted. In the eV energy range, the larger molecules were the dominant emitted species, whilst C atoms were emitted even at very low energies. A small percentage of Be was implanted in the C layer, and was found to reduce sputtering of the large molecules, whereas the emission of the small molecules and the C atoms was slightly reduced or remained unchanged.

Tritium is released via the exchange reaction with sweep gases containing hydrogen. It is expected that the isotope exchange reaction is promoted by adding noble metals that possess catalytic functions. Thus, palladium was deposited in a sample of lithium orthosilicate, and the effect of catalyst on the rate of isotope exchange reaction on the sample surface was examined. It was found that the isotope exchange reaction proceeds faster even at lower temperatures over the breeder materials with a catalytic additive and its activation energy can be considerably lowered. This result suggests that the isotope exchange reaction can be promoted by the deposition of catalytic metals. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

(2) In the experiment with natural Li2O pebbles sandwiched by beryllium layers. TPR near the rear beryllium layer was overestimated by up to 10%. In order to identify the cause of the above problems clearly, a new blanket neutronics experiment with DT neutrons using natural Li2TiO3 layer and beryllium layers was conducted at FNS. TPR distributions inside the natural Li2TiO3 layer in assemblies with and without the source reflector were measured with Li2CO3 pellets. The measured TPR agreed well with the calculations within 6% in both assemblies. The influence of the reflector and beryllium on TPR prediction accuracy was not seen in the present experiment.

Neutronics assessment of the shielding and breeding requirements for FNSF (standard aspect ratio)	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			Fusion nuclear science facility; Inboard shielding; Radiation damage; Insulator; Magnet protection	COPPER-ALLOYS; ARIES-ST; DESIGN; IRRADIATION; CERAMICS	This paper presents design and analysis results regarding key aspects of the neutronics for a standard aspect ratio fusion nuclear science facility (FNSF). Optimization of the inboard design is based on maximizing tritium production and minimizing radiation damage to the ohmic heating coil (OHC). The calculations show that the outboard tritium breeding blanket alone is not enough for achieving tritium self-sufficiency in the FNSF. Options to enhance tritium production in FNSF include the use of either a thin, specifically designed tritium breeding blanket or the use of only a multiplier in the highly space-constrained inboard region. Trade-offs between breeding, shielding to protect the magnets, and materials for the inboard region shows that an inboard thickness of 50 cm is enough if a ceramic insulator is used. If an organic insulator is preferred, the inboard thickness has to be increased. Radiation-induced increase in the electrical resistivity of the copper has also been studied and its impact on the aforementioned optimization process for the blanket/shield thickness/material choice has been accounted for.

Mechanical design and first experimental results of an upgraded technical PERMCAT reactor for tritium recovery in the fuel cycle of a fusion machine	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			Fuel cycle; Membrane reactor; Tritium compatibility; PERMCAT	ITER	The PERMCAT process developed for the final clean-up stage of the Tokamak Exhaust Processing systems of the ITER tritium plant combines a catalytic reactor and a Pd/Ag permeator in a single component. A first generation technical PERMCAT has been successfully operated as part of the CAPER experiment at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe for several years. Various alternative PERMCAT mechanical designs were proposed and studied on small-scale prototypes. An upgraded technical PERMCAT reactor was designed, manufactured and commissioned with deuterium. A parallel arrangement of finger-type membranes inserted in a single catalyst bed design was chosen to simplify the geometry and the manufacturing while improving the robustness of the reactor. The component has been designed and manufactured to be fully tritium compatible and also fully compatible with both process and electrical connections of the previous PERMCAT to be replaced. The new PERMCAT mechanical design is more compact and easy to manufacture. This PERMCAT reactor was submitted to functional tests and experiments based on isotopic exchanges between H(2)O and D(2) to measure the processing performances. The first experimental results show decontamination factors versus flow rates better than all previously measured. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

When graphite materials are used in a part of plasma facing components, tritiated methane is contained in exhaust gas. Plasma decomposition is one of the techniques for extracting hydrogen from hydrocarbon. In order to evaluate direct decomposition of methane using helium RF plasma, a flow-type plasma reactor utilizing capacitively coupled plasma was developed and direct decomposition of methane was demonstrated. The decomposition rate of methane by helium plasma was proportional to the supplied RF power. However, it became small when total pressure of gas was high. A part of hydrogen generated from methane was retained in carbon deposits on the electrode. However, the accumulated hydrogen and carbon were effectively removed by the discharge-cleaning with oxygen plasma. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A long-term durability of VITON. AFLAS, denaturated polyphenylene ether, and Kapton polyimide immersed in a sulfonic acid was demonstrated. Negligible degradation in percent elongation at break of these polymeric materials was observed up to the immersing period of 2 years. The detectable radiation deterioration in ionic conductivity of Nafion (R) N117CS ion exchange membrane irradiated with electron beams up to the integrated dose of 1500 kGy was measured. The ionic conductivity of Nafion (R) N117CS ion exchange membrane irradiated at more than 1000 kGy was slightly deteriorated. As for the elastomers for its use as a seal, the radiation degradation in hardness of VITON, AFLAS was investigated. Considerable degradation in softness of these rubbers for its use as a seal was not observed up to the integrated dose of 1500 kGy. The water uptake of rubbers was generally increased as the integrated dose was increased. However, irradiated VITON rubbers had constant water uptake up to the integrated dose of 1500 kGy.

Corrosion of the structural material in Flinak is one of its issues. A corrosion test for Reduced Activation Ferritic Martensitic (RAFM) steel, JLF-1 (Fe-9Cr-2W-0.1C), was performed at 600 degrees C using both purified and non-purified Flinak. The Flinak was purified by the electro-refining process, where Ni and H(2)O content in the Flinak were decreased. The test was performed at static conditions and flowing conditions induced by an impeller. The results of the test in non-purified Flinak showed local corrosion on the steel surface at the grain, packet, block and lath boundaries. The corrosion of JLF-1 in purified Flinak was much less than that in the non-purified Flinak. The corrosion in these boundaries was not severe, though pitting corrosion by the local electro-circuit was partly detected. This is due to local impurity condensation either in the Flinak or on the surface. The corrosion loss in flowing condition was small, the same as that in the static conditions. The number of pitting corrosions on the surface for flowing conditions was less than that in the static test. The occurrence of pitting corrosion was controlled by the mixture and Flinak flow, in which the local impurity condensation was removed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Pure copper (Cu), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni) and molybdenum (Mo) were loaded with hydrogen including a trace amount of tritium and then immersed into water at around room temperatures. Then, the tritium release rate into the water was examined by a liquid scintillation counting technique and the surface tritium concentration by a tritium imaging plate technique. The tritium release from the metals is attributed to the release of dissolved tritium by diffusion from the normal interstitial sites, and the first order desorption of trapped one with detrapping energies of 64, 72 and 25 kJ mol(-1) for Cu, Fe and Mo. respectively. Overall release behavior is varied depending on the ratio of dissolved and trapped amounts of tritium. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For efficient neutralization of the accelerated hydrogen or deuterium ions, a particular gas density profile along the beamline is required in the HNB system. A novel Monte Carlo simulation code has been developed which is able to simulate not only the beamline density profile, but also the 3D density distribution inside the vacuum vessel. This paper describes the main ideas behind and the essential features of the new code and shows how the resulting density distribution depends upon the installed cryopumping system. The numbers given in this paper refer to the reference case with deuterium operation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As the results, ZrO(2) showed relatively good permeation reduction performance about 1/10, and results indicated that deuterium permeates through the grain boundaries and/or cracks formed in the ZrO(2) coating. Improvement such as filling diffusion paths will be effective for further permeation reduction performance. On the other hand, gold plating showed excellent permeation reduction performance around 550 K. Permeation reduction by gold plating would be attributed to low solubility of deuterium in gold. Additionally, results of thermal stress analysis were consistent with the results of permeation experiment. Therefore, thermal stress analysis could be an effective method for the selecting permeation reduction coatings prior to the permeation experiment. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Toward realizing this application, the fabrication of erbium oxide coatings by metal-organic decomposition has been carried out on reduced activation ferritic/martensitic steels. The coated samples exhibit different surface structures after they are heat-treated under different conditions. A sample that is heat-treated in high-purity argon produces an oxide layer between the erbium oxide coating and the substrate. It is believed that the presence of this oxide layer causes defects in the coating and degradation of the samples during deuterium permeation measurements. The sample heat-treated in high-purity hydrogen with moisture exhibits a thinner oxide layer and improved stability during measurements. A 0.3-mu m-thick coating yields a permeation reduction factor of 500-700 at 773-973 K, which is comparable to the coating deposited by the physical vapor deposition technique. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Neutronics experiments on HCPB and HCLL TBM mock-ups in preparation of nuclear measurements in ITER	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			Tritium breeder blanket; Tritium production rate; Neutron cross-sections; Benchmark experiments	DETECTOR	In support of the breeder blanket development program, the EU is conducting a dedicated neutronics R&D effort to provide the basis for the design of nuclear tests to be performed in ITER on the Test Blanket Modules (TBMs). It includes the development of computational tools comprising both Monte-Carlo and deterministic transport, sensitivity and uncertainty codes, the generation of high quality neutron cross-section and covariance data libraries. These are validated experimentally in view of their application in the ITER TBM and the DEMO design. To this purpose, two neutronics experiments have been carried out on mock-ups of both the Helium Cooled Pebble Bed (HCPB) and the Helium Cooled Lithium Lead (HCLL) variants of ITER IBMs, at 14-MeV neutron sources. Redundant experimental techniques have been used to measure the resulting tritium production rate and the neutron and gamma ray spectra which are needed to predict the blanket shielding performance, nuclear power production and all nuclear loads. The comparison of experiment and corresponding calculation is obtained with the associated uncertainty margin based on experimental as well as calculational uncertainties. At the same time, suitable nuclear measuring techniques for TBMs in ITER, in particular for the tritium production, are being developed, optimised, and tested in the mock-up experiments. In particular, the present paper summarizes the preliminary results of the latest of such experiments, i.e. the one conducted on a mock-up of the HCLL blanket. It describes also the dedicated neutronics R&D activities, including the efforts to specify the neutronics tests and objectives in TBMs in ITER, considering the various design concepts.

Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses of the HCLL mock-up experiment	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			Tritium breeder blanket; Tritium production rate; Neutronics; Nuclear cross-sections		Within the European Fusion Technology Programme dedicated computational methods, tools and data have been developed and validated for sensitivity and uncertainty analyses of fusion neutronics experiments. The present paper is devoted to this kind of analyses on the recent neutronics experiment on a mock-up of the Helium-Cooled Lithium Lead Test Blanket Module for ITER at the Frascati neutron generator. They comprise both probabilistic and deterministic methodologies for the assessment of uncertainties of nuclear responses due to nuclear data uncertainties and their sensitivities to the involved reaction cross-section data. We have used MCNP and MCSEN codes in the Monte Carlo approach and DORT and SUSD3D in the deterministic approach for transport and sensitivity calculations, respectively. In both cases JEFF-3.1 and FENDL-2.1 libraries for the transport data and mainly ENDF/B-VI.8 and SCALE6.0 libraries for the relevant covariance data have been used. With a few exceptions, the two different methodological approaches were shown to provide consistent results. A total nuclear data related uncertainty in the range of 1-2% (1 sigma confidence level) was assessed for the tritium production in the HCLL mock-up experiment. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

PRIMA includes two experimental devices: a full size plasma source with low voltage extraction called SPIDER (Source for Production of Ion of Deuterium Extracted from RF plasma) and a full size neutral beam injector at full beam power called MITICA (Megavolt ITER Injector Concept Advancement). SPIDER is the first experimental device to be built and operated, aiming at testing the extraction of a negative ion beam (made of H(-) and in a later stage D(-) ions) from an ITER size ion source. The main requirements of this experiment are a H(-)/D(-) current of approximately 70A/50A and an energy of 100 key. This paper presents an overview of the SPIDER beam source design, with a particular focus on the main design choices, aiming at reaching the best compromise between physics, optics, thermo-mechanical, cooling, assembly and electrical requirements.

A new modular design concept for China's HCSB TBM in ITER	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			DEMO; HCSB; TBM; TBR		Previous designs from China (CN) for a helium-cooled solid breeder (HCSB) breeder blanket (BB) require modifications to increase the tritium breeding ratio (TBR) so that the design will satisfy tritium self-sufficiency requirements for a power-producing fusion reactor (DEMO) while ensuring engineering feasibility. A modified design for a CN HCSB test blanket module (TBM) is given in which thick enclosure walls around the breeding units are removed, the mass of cooling plate structural material is reduced, and the ratio (by volume) of Be zones to Li(4)SiO(4) zones is optimized. Analysis of the proposed design is performed by using Monte Carlo neutron transport code. The TBR of the proposed design is 1.18, which is greater than the 1.15 ratio required for tritium self-sufficiency, and 39.15% higher than the previous design's TBR of 0.848. Based on new 3D neutronics results for a DEMO reactor, a preliminary 2 x 6 HCSB TBM design concept is suggested. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) thermofluid study, an electrical insulation coating is extremely important from the viewpoint of the secure electrical insulating wall condition. The present study employs a sol-gel (SG) method to fabricate an Al(2)O(3) coating, and discusses the feasibility of the SG coating as an electrical insulation coating for the PbLi through the electrical insulation test in the molten PbLi pool and the SEM with EDS analysis on the SG coating structure.

After the irradiation, the irradiated F82H was continuously exposed to 1.7 key deuterium ions. The effects of the damages introduced by the helium ion irradiation on deuterium retention and desorption behavior of F82H were investigated. The HD desorption had a peak at around 500K, which was shifted to the high temperature region when the helium ion fluence increased. The decrease in HDO desorption at the high fluence region was observed. This might be owing to the oxygen depletion on the surface by the sputtering. The amount of retained deuterium of the F82H gradually increased with the helium ion fluence and saturated at 7.2 dpa. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The main objective of ITER is to demonstrate the scientific and technical feasibility of a controlled fusion reaction that will allow the production of approximately 500 MW of fusion power for durations of several hundred seconds. As an experimental facility, ITER is intended to allow the exploration of physics scenarios, to conduct the technological tests essential to the preparation of a fusion reactor, and to demonstrate the favorable safety characteristics of fusion. The ITER tokamak cooling water system (TCWS) consists of several separate systems to cool the major ITER components the divertor/limiter, the first wall blanket, the vacuum vessel, and the neutral beam injector. The ex-vessel part of the TCWS provides a confinement function for tritium and activated corrosion products in the cooling water. The vacuum vessel system also has a functional safety requirement regarding the residual heat removal from in-vessel components. A preliminary hazards assessment (PHA) was performed for a better understanding of the hazards, initiating events, and defense-in-depth mechanisms associated with the TCWS. The PHA was completed using the following steps. (1) Hazard identification. Hazards associated with the TCWS were identified including radiological/chemical/electromagnetic hazards and physical hazards (e.g., high voltage, high pressure, high temperature, and falling objects). (2) Hazard categorization. Hazards identified in the first step were categorized as to their potential for harm to the workers, the public, and/or the environment. (3) Hazard evaluation. The design was examined to determine initiating events that might occur and that could expose the public, the environment, or workers to the hazard. In addition, the system was examined to identify barriers that prevent exposure. Finally, consequences to the public or workers were qualitatively assessed should the initiating event occur and one or more of the barriers fail. Frequency of occurrence of the initiating event and subsequent barrier failure was qualitatively estimated. (4) Accident analyses. A preliminary hazards analysis was performed on the conceptual design of the TCWS. As the design progresses, a detailed accident analysis will be performed in the form of a failure modes and effects analysis. The results of the PHA indicated that the principal hazards associated with the TCWS were those associated with radiation. These were low compared to hazards associated with nuclear fission reactors and were limited to potential exposure to the on-site workers if appropriate protective actions were not used. However, the risk to the general public off-site was found to be negligible even under worst case accident conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this work, H(2) and D(2) isotherms on synthetic zeolite 4A (SZ-4A) were measured at 77.4 K and 87.3 K, and separation factors were investigated in the systems of H(2)-D(2) and H(2)-HD-D(2) at the same temperatures, in addition to the examination on SZ-5A at 87.3 K. The isotherms on SZ-4A at both temperatures are fitted with the model expression as well as on SZ-5A and SZ-13X, and also the separation factors are described with the IAS theory. The results show the high performance of SZ-4A for hydrogen isotope separation relatively to that of SZ-5A or/and SZ-13X. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Verification of hydrogen isotope separation/enrichment by pressure swing adsorption process: Successive enrichment of deuterium using SZ-5A column	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			Hydrogen isotope separation; Pressure swing adsorption; Zeolite 5A; Deuterium; Tritium	BREAKTHROUGH CURVES; SEPARATION PROCESS; DISTILLATION; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEM	We have been developing a system of hydrogen isotope separation using a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) method, aiming at applying it in the fusion fuel cycle and/or the convenient deuterium production for fusion or/and fission reactors. Particularly, for the issue that tritium inventory in the DT fusion system must be as low as possible, the PSA method will be advantageous because its process inventory is reasonably less than such as in a cryogenic distillation system. The PSA system is generally composed of several adsorption columns cooperating in sequential procedure and alternative combination among adsorption, desorption and another preparative process. A variety of operational modes are made suitable for producing a material needed to be enriched or isolated. In this work, supposing the production of deuterium from natural hydrogen or the recovery of tritium from such as a spent nuclear heavy-water moderator, we carried out an experimental series of PSA process system operating successive separation and enrichment of tracer D(2) from a H(2)-D(2) mixture, using a single column packed with SZ-5A at 77.4 K. Availability of the PSA hydrogen isotope separation process is endorsed in experimental results. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Up to six different concepts for tritium breeding blanket systems, referred to as Test Blanket Systems (TBS), will be tested in three equatorial ports of ITER. Successful TBS experiments in ITER represent an essential step on the path to DEMO for all the ITER Members' fusion development plans. The ITER Members are in charge of the design, manufacturing and delivery of the TBSs to the ITER site. The 10 has responsibility for preparing the necessary interfaces required for the installation of the TBSs. Moreover, the TBM Program has to be fully integrated in the ITER Research Plan and its testing objectives have to be synchronized with the planned ITER operations. The paper addresses the major implementation steps of the TBM Program in ITER, including the organizational aspects, its integration into the ITER Research Plan and the Operational Plan, the licensing procedure and also gives a short overview of the TBS/ITER interfaces issues.

The storage and delivery system, one of main systems of the fuel cycle in the nuclear fusion power plant, has a function of the high fuelling throughput to the fuelling system and the neutral beam injection system. However, few tritium compatible pumps have generally been proposed for the delivery of hydrogen isotopes. One of tritium compatible pumps, MB 601 which has the largest throughput among metal bellows pumps, is selected for the performance test using SPOVE equipment. For two cases of heads-in-parallel and heads-in-series types of MB 601, single pump models are developed under the isothermal and non-isothermal conditions. The dominant parameters of pump models are estimated and compared with the experimental data. It was found that the estimated pumping speeds of the combination of two MB 601 pumps are in agreement with the experimental results. Based on the comparison among combinations of two MB 601 pumps, a parallel combination of heads-in-series types has more pumping speed than others in the range of P(S)/P(D) is an element of (0.3,1).

The JT-60SA will be capable of confining break-even equivalent class high-temperature deuterium plasmas at a plasma current I(p) of 5.5 MA and a major radius of similar to 3 m lasting for a duration longer than the timescales characteristic of plasma processes, pursue full non-inductive steady-state operation with high plasma beta close to and exceeding no-wall ideal stability limits, and establish ITER-relevant high density plasma regimes well above the H-mode power threshold. Re-baselining of the project was completed in late 2008 which has been worked on since late 2007, where all the scientific missions are preserved with the newly designed machine to meet the cost objectives. The JT-60SA project made a large step forward towards its construction, which now foresees the first plasma in 2016. Construction of JT-60SA begins at Naka in Japan with launching the procurement of PF magnet, vacuum vessel and in-vessel components by Japan. In this year, the procurement of TF magnet, cryostat and power supply will be launched by Europe. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This device has been proposed for processing fusion reactor plasma exhaust gas. A stream containing tritium (up to 1% of tritium in different chemical forms such as water, methane or molecular hydrogen) is decontaminated in the PERMCAT by counter-current isotopic swamping with protium. Different mechanical designs of the membrane reactor have been proposed to improve robustness and lifetime. The ENEA membrane reactor uses a permeator tube with a length of about 500 mm produced via cold-rolling and diffusion welding of Pd/Ag thin foils: two stainless steel pre-tensioned bellows have been applied to the Pd/Ag tube in order to avoid any significant compressive and bending stresses due to the permeator tube elongation consequent to the hydrogen uptake. An experimental test campaign has been performed using this reactor in order to assess the influence of different operating parameters and to evaluate the overall performance (decontamination factor). Tests have been carried out on two reactor prototypes: a defect-free membrane with complete (infinite) hydrogen selectivity and not perm-selective membrane. In this last case, the study has been aimed at verifying the behaviour of the PERMCAT devices under non-normal (accidental) conditions in the view of providing information for future safety analysis. The paper will present the specific mechanical design and the experimental results of tests based on isotopic exchange between H(2)O and D(2). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Especially, the isotopic atoms of hydrogen, deuterium or tritium would exist in the environment of fusion reaction. However, few works were reported about the isotope effect of hydrogen on irradiation damage. This work used ion accelerator to implant ions of hydrogen or deuterium into the samples of pure iron at R.T., followed by annealing at high temperature to make the defects develop into large dislocation loops. The electron irradiation by high voltage electron microscope was carried out to check the nature of loops. The isotopic effect on the bias of dislocation loops was discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

ITER will use and create some toxic and radiotoxic materials. Tritium will be used as part of its fuelling, and beryllium on plasma facing components. Dust will be produced in plasma operation in the vacuum vessel as well as activated corrosion products in the primary cooling circuits. Thus, small quantities of releases of the toxic and radioactive materials in the environment could not be excluded. In order to ensure the compliance of ITER licensing with French regulations, the ITER design has to demonstrate that the safety of workers, the environment and members of the public is ensured following not only international regulations but also the three principles mentioned in the French Public Health Code: principles of justification of the activities, of limitation of consequences below authorised limits and of optimization. The ITER teams involved in the design of systems and structures have the permanent goals to ensure this compliance with French regulations in particular to reduce, as far as reasonably achievable, the impact of ITER activities on workers, the public and on the environment and to show that this meets the optimization principle. This optimization process is one of the major ITER safety challenges and has required a great effort of optimization, incorporated iteratively into the design, since the beginning. This will be notably reached through several provisions such as the adequate selection of materials, the reduction, close control and monitoring of radioactive inventories, the confinement of radioactive and toxic materials, layout and shielding design, the remote handling capability, the operating and maintenance procedures. The main activities for which an optimization process is used include, but are not limited to: radioactive and toxic releases from routine operations, including maintenance, waste production and workers internal and external exposure from tritium, beryllium and radioactive dust corrosion products. The presentation will explain the different steps used for this optimization process during the ITER design phase on the basis of a few examples. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Neutronics analysis of the conceptual design of a component test facility based on the spherical tokamak	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	OCT 11-16, 2009	Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA			Neutronics; CTF; Spherical tokamak; Fusion	COPPER-ALLOYS; TEMPERATURE; IRRADIATION	One of the crucial aspects of fusion research is the optimisation and qualification of suitable materials and components. To enable the design and construction of DEMO in the future, ITER is taken to demonstrate the scientific and technological feasibility and IFMIF will provide rigorous testing of small material samples. Meanwhile, a dedicated, small-scale components testing facility (CTF) is proposed to complement and extend the functions of ITER and IFMIF and operate in association with DEMO so as to reduce the risk of delays during this phase of fusion power development. The design of a spherical tokamak (ST)-based CTF is being developed which offers many advantages over conventional machines, including lower tritium consumption, easier maintenance, and a compact assembly. The neutronics analysis of this system is presented here. Based on a three-dimensional neutronics model generated by the interface programme MCAM from CAD models, a series of nuclear and radiation protection analyses were carried out using the MCNP code and FENDL2.1 nuclear data library to assess the current design and guide its development if needed. The nuclear analyses addresses key neutronics issues such as the neutron wall loading (NWL) profile, nuclear heat loads, and radiation damage to the coil insulation and to structural components, particularly the stainless steel vessel wall close to the NBI ports where shielding is limited. The shielding of the divertor coil and the internal Poloidal Field (PF) coil, which is introduced in the expanded divertor design, are optimised to reduce their radiation damage. The preliminary results show that the peak radiation damage to the structure of martensitic/ferritic steel is about 29 dpa at the mid-plane assuming a life of 12 years at a duty factor 33%, which is much lower than its similar to 150 dpa limit. In addition, TBMs installed in 8 mid-plane ports and 6 lower ports, and 60% Li-6 enrichment in the Li4SiO4 breeder, the total tritium generation is similar to 3.7 kg in the whole lifetime of CTF.
