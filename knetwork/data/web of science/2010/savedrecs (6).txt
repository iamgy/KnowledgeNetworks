QUPID, a single photon sensor for extremely low radioactivity	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Technology and Instrumentation in Particle Physics (TIPP 09)	MAR 12-17, 2009	Tsukuba, JAPAN			Hybrid photo detector HPD		We have successfully developed a new photon sensor, the Quartz Photon Intensifying Detector (QUPID), for experiments such as dark matter searches and observation of double beta decay. The QUPID is a type of hybrid-photo-detector (HPD), consisting of a special bialkali photocathode considering the operation under extremely low temperature such as the temperature of liquid xenon, -108 degrees C, and a special avalanche photodiode for electron bombardment. The QUPID is constructed solely from extremely low radioactive materials, such as quartz and Si-avalanche photodiodes (APDs), which allows it to reach radiation levels of less than 1 mBq while being able to detect single photons. In this paper, we report superior characteristics of the QUPID confirmed by the evaluation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The unprecedented sensitivity of 0.2 eV/c(2) will improve present limits by one order of magnitude. The decay electrons will originate from a 10m long windowless gaseous tritium source. Super-conducting magnets will guide the electrons through a differential and cryogenic pumping section to the electro-static tandem spectrometer (MAG-E-filter), where the kinetic energy will be measured. The experiment is presently being built at the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe by an international collaboration of more than 120 scientists. The largest component, the 1240 m(3) main spectrometer, was delivered end of 2006 and first commissioning tests have been performed. This paper gives an overview of the goals and technological challenges of the experiment and reports on the progress in commissioning first major components. The start of first measurements is expected in 2012. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Measurements of the elastic scattering cross sections for proton on T, He-4	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Elastic scattering cross sections; Proton; Tritium; Helium	LABORATORY ANGLE; HELIUM; 165-DEGREES; TRITIUM; REGION; IONS	The cross sections for the elastic scattering of protons from tritium at 151 degrees and from helium at 155 degrees angles in the laboratory frame, over the energy range of 1.2-3.4 MeV, have been measured in the present work, as a supplement to previous cross section measurements determined at different scattering angles recently. The currently measured cross section data are compared to data available in literature. The cross section enhancement was also investigated for both reactions. It was found that over the whole measured energy range, the elastic cross section for protons on tritium increases linearly with energy and is about 1000 times greater than the Rutherford cross section at 3.4 MeV. On the other hand, in the case of the elastic scattering of protons from helium, the cross section below 2.3 MeV increases almost linearly, and reaches a maximum of about 300 mb/str at the energy of 2.4 MeV for the scattering angle of 165, and then, after this energy, it keeps oscillating around the maximum.

MODELING SOLIDIFICATION-INDUCED STRESS IN CERAMIC WASTE FORMS CONTAINING NUCLEAR WASTES	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						solidification stress; ceramic waste forms; nuclear wastes	PRODUCTS	The goal of this work is to produce a ceramic waste form that permanently occludes radioactive waste. This is accomplished by absorbing radioactive salts into zeolite, mixing with glass frit, heating to a molten state at 915 degrees C to form a socialite glass matrix, and solidifying for long-term storage. Less long-term leaching is expected if the solidifying cooling rate does not cause cracking. In addition to thermal stress, this paper proposes a mathematical model for the stress formed during solidification, which is very large for fast cooling rates during solidification and can cause severe cracking. A solidifying glass or ceramic cylinder forms a dome on the cylinder top end. The temperature distribution during solidification causes the solidification stress and the dome resulting in an axial length deficit. The axial stress, determined by the length deficit, remains when the solid is at room temperature with the outer region in compression and the inner region in tension. Large tensions will cause cracking of the specimen. The temperature deficit, derived by dividing the length deficit by the coefficient of thermal expansion, allows solidification stress theory to be extended to the circumferential stress. This paper derives the solidification stress model, gives examples, explains how to induce beneficial stresses, and compares theory to experimental data.

Monolithic fuel design provides higher uranium loading than that of the traditional dispersion fuel design. Hot isostatic pressing is a promising process for low-cost batch fabrication of monolithic RERTR fuel plates for these high-power reactors. Bonding U-Mo fuel foil and 6061-Al cladding by hot isostatic press bonding was successfully developed at Idaho National Laboratory. Because of the relatively high processing temperature, the interaction between fuel meat and aluminum cladding is a concern. Two different methods were employed to mitigate this effect: a diffusion barrier and a doping addition to the interface. Both types of fuel plates have been fabricated by hot isostatic press bonding. Preliminary results show that the direct fuel/cladding interaction during the bonding process was eliminated by introducing a thin zirconium diffusion barrier layer between the fuel and the cladding. Fuel plates were also produced and characterized with a silicon-rich interlayer between fuel and cladding. This paper reports the recent progress of this developmental effort and identifies the areas that need further attention.

Full-core SSCWR calculations applying a fast computational method	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Review						SCWR; Zirconium-hydride; Coupled analysis; Full-core analysis; Homogenization method	LIGHT-WATER-REACTOR; SUPERCRITICAL-PRESSURE; DESIGN; FUEL	The Supercritical Water-Cooled Reactor (SCWR) is a generation IV reactor concept which uses super-critical pressure water as coolant. By now, several versions of these concepts have been developed. A new thermal design called Simplified SCWR (SSCWR) was proposed in Reiss et al. (2010): the most important characteristics of the assembly are partial-length zirconium-hydride rods as extra moderator, axially varying fuel enrichment and a longer active length; also, the core had a smaller diameter compared to the original SCWR concept. This new type of assembly is optimized taking into account the neutronic and thermal-hydraulic properties. A one-pass core consisting of these assemblies is examined. Full-core calculations are computationally very expensive, thus a step-by-step homogenization process - complemented with extensive validation work - is applied using the code system SCALE6.0. This approach enabled a preliminary optimization of the one-pass core resulting in a favourable power distribution. This paper presents the outcome of the optimization of the assembly (fuel pin diameter 8.0 mm, pitch 10.12 mm, P/D 1.1), the developed fast computational method and the preliminary results of the full-core calculations (average fuel enrichment around 6.0%, radial power peaking below 1.3, maximum coolant temperature below 800 K and maximum cladding temperature below 850 K).

ASTEC V1.3 code SOPHAEROS module validation using the STORM experiments	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Review						ASTEC; STORM; SOPHAEROS; Resuspension; Deposition; Aerosol		In most of the severe accident scenarios in light water reactors the deposition and resuspension of aerosols in the primary circuit are the main factors influencing the release of radioactive material into the containment. Due to energetic interactions, e.g. hydrogen burning, or fluid mechanical load high velocity jets or sudden pressure changes, the deposited aerosols can be resuspended and significantly increase the amount of radioactive material reaching the containment and finally the potential threat of release into the environment (source term). In this paper two aerosol mechanical resuspension models: the semi-empirical Force-Balance (FB) and more mechanistic Rock 'n' Roll (RnR) implemented in the SOPHAEROS/ASTEC V1.3 Rev.0 version are validated against the STORM aerosol mechanical resuspension experiments SR09, SR10, SR11, SR12 and SR13 and the modeling weaknesses are identified. In spite of the fact that these models encompass the measurements, it is shown that further improvement of the aerosol resuspension model in the SOPHAEROS module is necessary in order to achieve better predictability of the source term during a severe accident.

According to the cost benefit analysis results, the optimized BeO content was about 4.8 wt% when the BeO and uranium oxide prices were assumed to be $317/kg and $64/kg, respectively. The benefit of increasing the thermal conductivity of BeO-UO2 fuel was greater than the burden of the expensive BeO material price if the Be0 content was 4.8 wt%. In addition, the break-even point of the nuclear fuel cycle cost as a function of the burn-up was 4.4 mills/kWh when compared economically between BeO-UO2 fuel and UO2 fuel. Therefore, BeO-UO2 fuel seems economically efficient when the burn-up is more than 60 MWD/kg because the nuclear fuel cycle cost of BeO-UO2 fuel was lower than that of UO2 fuel.

New accounting system for liability provisions and Radioactive Waste Management Act in Korea	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Review						Accounting system; Liability provisions; Radwaste Management Act; Cost estimation		This paper quantitatively assesses the influence of a new accounting system for liability provisions. According to the analysis results, the new accounting system was able to estimate more accurate amounts of the radwaste's costs than that of previous accounting systems. Removing a steep increase of liability provisions over time recognized acquisition costs of the related assets. For example, it was identified that the transferred decommissioning costs were able to decrease 52% in 2040 because the new accounting system recognized great costs earlier in time when compared to the outdated version of the accounting system. Additionally, in order to secure a radwaste's fund for NPPs, the Korean Radwaste Management Act was legislated in 2007 thanks to government efforts. This Act has been a cornerstone in the levy and operation of the radwaste fund with cash liquidity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Kim, S. K.; Lim, C. Y.; Choi, H. J.; Ko, W.

J	Kornreich, DE; Bowen, DG; Parsons, DK				Kornreich, Drew E.; Bowen, Douglas G.; Parsons, D. Kent			Examination of uranium and plutonium solution criticality in high-concentration solutions	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Review						Plutonium; Uranium; Solution; Critical; Density		It all comes down to physics. This paper describes calculations using the discrete-ordinates codes PARTISN and DANTSYS as well as the stochastic code MCNP and various cross section sets to examine the critical mass of highly enriched uranium and high-grade plutonium solutions in the concentration range of up to a few hundred grams per liter. When considering these solutions, uranium solutions have a slightly smaller critical mass in some concentration regions; a key goal is therefore to discern the underlying reasons for the differences in these solutions' critical masses. The differences in the critical masses between these two materials are primarily the result of parasitic absorption by Pu-240 in the plutonium solutions. However, even with solutions of pure U-235 and Pu-239 isotopes, the U-235 solutions still have a slightly smaller critical mass than Pu-239 solutions. This possibly counterintuitive result (at least from the non-practitioner's point of view) is primarily because U-235 is a more efficient neutron producer than Pu-239 in epithermal systems as demonstrated by an analysis of the parameter eta. Thus, these results serve as a reminder to the criticality safety community and as a point of interest to those outside of the community to avoid preconceptions when considering criticality safety in solutions of U-235 and Pu-239; these results also provide the criticality safety community with a review of the key parameters that drive neutronic behavior as found in the latest ENDF/B cross section sets and how these results compare to other cross section sets.

In order to conduct this work, a variety of parameters were considered such as risk factor, radionuclide inventory, atmospheric dispersion factor (chi/Q). dose conversion factor, and so on. The main risk factors leading to arbitrary accidents were developed by the master logic diagram (MLD) method based on a fault tree analysis (FTA). The dose to curie (DTC) method was used to calculate the radionuclide inventory. Then, the release rates with respect to the type of wastes and radionuclides were considered in order to evaluate the amount of radionuclides released by the risk factors. Furthermore, the atmospheric dispersion factor (chi/Q) was calculated by the PAVAN code based on various models and assumptions suggested in the U.S. NRC Regulatory Guide 1.145. The dose assessments for arbitrary accidents originating in the TSF for LILW management are conducted by considering the external exposure dose by radioactive plume and the internal exposure dose by breathing. Synthesizing many parameters, the INDAC++, which is an integrated dose assessment code package for normal reaction operation and for accident analysis of LILW managed in the TSF, was developed using Visual C# in Microsoft Visual Studio.NET 2003. Furthermore, the INDAC++ can calculate the radiological risk with regard to the main risk factors for workers and the public. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This type of natural zeolite is generally used as a mineral admixture by substitution in Portland cement to produce high performance concretes. In the present study, the major, minor and trace element levels present in the clinoptilolite-rich natural zeolite (CRNZ) have been determined using a wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. Also, the clinoptilolite-rich natural zeolite has been compared with Portland cement with respect to the radiation attenuation properties. From the results it can be concluded that due to the natural radioactive content of clinoptilolite-rich natural zeolite (CRNZ) even if it is in trace level and also due to the poorer X-ray attenuation compared with Portland cement, special care should be taken to use this type of natural zeolite as blend materials in cements, etc. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Childhood and in utero exposure to moderate and high levels of ionizing radiation, such as those experienced during the atomic bombings of Japan, or from radiotherapy, is an established cause of leukaemia and solid cancer. There is no evidence of increase in solid cancers (excluding thyroid cancer) or leukaemia in the children from Chernobyl, and no evident link between worker's exposure to radiation and leukaemia in their offspring or with the presence of leukaemia clusters around nuclear power plants. It has also not been possible to demonstrate the evidence of radiation hereditary effects in human populations. In accordance with international guidance, Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission recommends optimisation of protection strategies to reduce doses to children. The development of credible radiological/nuclear event scenarios would assist in identifying probable sources of radioactivity and pathways of exposure for children. Such scenarios should then be used to identify protection strategies appropriate for children.

J	Chen, J				Chen, Jing			Doses to children from intakes by ingestion	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Biological Dosimetry, Increasing Capacity for emergency Response	MAY 19-19, 2010	Ottawa, CANADA					In this article, sensitivities and doses to children from intakes of radionuclides by ingestion were studied relative to adults. Generally speaking, doses to children were higher due to their higher radiosensitiveness to many radionuclides, even though they consume less food and water than adults. Therefore, the action levels in the Canadian guidelines for the restriction of radioactively contaminated food and water following a nuclear emergency were selected as the most restrictive among the six age groups that could lead to an individual receiving a dose equal to a specified intervention level of 1 mSv. For non-emergency situations, the specified intervention level is 0.1 mSv. At such a low intervention level, the maximum acceptable concentrations (MAC) in drinking water are normally derived for adults. Although this is a common practice for guidelines in non-emergency operations, for those radionuclides when the doses to children are more than 10 times higher than the doses to adults, the MAC in non-emergency situations should be limited to, at least, as restrictive as the action levels for interventional action following a nuclear emergency.

First response considerations for children exposed to a radiological dispersal device	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Biological Dosimetry, Increasing Capacity for emergency Response	MAY 19-19, 2010	Ottawa, CANADA				EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS; POPULATIONS	Children are considered a vulnerable population during an accidental or deliberate release of radioactive material to the environment due to the fact that they have more active cell division compared with the adult population and therefore detrimental effects promulgate very quickly. Additionally, physical and social characteristics of children make them more prone to internalise a toxin (for example, children are closer to the ground where heavy aerosols can collect; children also have more relaxed sanitary habits compared with the adult population, which aids in hand-to-mouth transfer of contaminants). To confound matters, many emergency protocols are based upon a reference as opposed to a child. Although numerous radiological response exercises have been conducted in the years post 9/11, very few have utilised children actively in the scenarios. This paper considers observations made during a NATO exercise with scenarios covering radiological releases and which utilised a variety of children as exercise participants.

In order to guarantee quick and precise beam transport procedures, the facility has been equipped with a high sensitivity beam diagnostics, well designed for very low intensity beams. In this paper we describe the features and the experimental results of the device developed for the low energy beam line (10-300 keV) of the facility. Such a multisensor device is mainly based on particle detectors and allows to collect the needed parameters in real time. In particular it can measure the X-Y transverse beam profile and intensity, and can identify the radioisotopes present in the beam. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Experimental test of the background rejection, through imaging capability, of a highly segmented AGATA germanium detector	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Gamma spectroscopy; Gamma tracking; Imaging; Position-sensitive germanium detectors	SPECTROSCOPY; DESIGN	The development of highly segmented germanium detectors as well as the algorithms to identify the position of the interaction within the crystal opens the possibility to locate the gamma-ray source using Compton imaging algorithms. While the Compton-suppression shield, coupled to the germanium detector in conventional arrays, works also as an active filter against the gamma rays originated outside the target, the new generation of position sensitive gamma-ray detector arrays has to fully rely on tracking capabilities for this purpose. In specific experimental conditions, as the ones foreseen at radioactive beam facilities, the ability to discriminate background radiation improves the sensitivity of the gamma spectrometer. In this work we present the results of a measurement performed at the Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro (LNL) aiming the evaluation of the AGATA detector capabilities to discriminate the origin of the gamma rays on an event-by-event basis. It will be shown that, exploiting the Compton scattering formula, it is possible to track back gamma rays coming from different positions, assigning them to specific emitting locations. These imaging capabilities are quantified for a single crystal AGATA detector. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The radiochemical purity of I-131-YG5 or I-131-Boc-YG5 was almost 100% after purification by RP-HPLC. Biodistribution in BALB/C nude mice bearing MCF-7 tumor was measured. After t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc)-modification, the I-131-Boc-YG5 was quite resistant to deiodination in vivo, resulting in negligible radioactivity accumulation in thyroid. The radiotracer clearance in tumor became faster, the absolute tumor uptake decreased for I-131-Boc-YG5, but the tumor-to-tissue uptake ratios increased. The uptake ratios of tumor to muscle, blood, heart, and lung at I h post injection reached 4.73, 1.70, 4.09 and 1.70, respectively.

Changes to the reflectance of Be mirrors due to deuterium plasmas contaminated with oxygen	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; ION-BOMBARDMENT; FUSION-REACTOR; BERYLLIUM; OXIDATION	The reflectance of Be mirrors due to impact by ions from a deuterium plasma has been studied under several bombardment conditions. Analysis of the resulting surface films has been performed using various diagnostic techniques, with the conclusion that the primary factor leading to the decrease in reflectance following bombardment with energetic ions is the conversion of the surface oxide layer, composed of BeO, to the hydroxide, Be(OD)(2), with a corresponding increase in the optical extinction coefficient. The increase in the thickness of the layer is also important. Modifications to the surface layer are thought to involve a balance between the ion-induced diffusion of Be atoms to the surface where they may react with incident D and O atoms, and physical and chemical sputtering processes. For incident ion energies less than similar to 50 eV, chemical reactions leading to disoxidation of the oxide-hydroxide film dominate, while key-range ions (primarily D, but with some O impurities) lead to the formation of hydroxide, and an increase in the surface layer thickness.

Measurement of radiation-enhanced diffusion of La in single crystal thin film CeO2	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							METALS	The diffusion of La, a trivalent cation dopant, actinide surrogate, and high-yield fission product, in CeO2, a UO2 nuclear fuel surrogate, during 1.8 MeV Kr+ ion bombardment over a temperature range from 673 K to 1206 K has been measured with secondary ion mass spectroscopy. The diffusivity under these irradiation conditions has been analyzed with a model based on a combination of sink-limited and recombination-limited kinetics. This analysis yielded a cation vacancy migration energy of E-m(v) similar to 0.4 eV below similar to 800 K, were recombination-limited kinetics dominated the behavior. The thermal diffusivity of La in the same system was measured over a range of 873-1073 K and was characterized by an activation enthalpy of E-a = E-f(v) + E-m(v) similar to 1.4 eV. The measurement of both the migration enthalpy and total activation enthalpy separately allows the vacancy formation enthalpy on the cation sublattice to be determined: E-f(v) similar to 1 eV. The mixing parameter under energetic heavy-ion bombardment at room temperature was measured as well and found to be similar to 4 x 10(-5) nm(5)/eV. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Cheng, T; Baney, RH; Tulenko, J				Cheng, Ting; Baney, Ronald H.; Tulenko, James			The feasibility of using molten carbonate corrosion for separating a nuclear surrogate for plutonium oxide from silicon carbide inert matrix	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							OXIDATION; SALTS; VAPOR	Silicon carbide is one of the prime candidates as a matrix material in inert matrix fuels (IMF) being designed to reduce the plutonium inventories. Since complete fission and transmutation is not practical in a single in-core run, it is necessary to separate the non-transmuted actinide materials from the silicon carbide matrix for recycling. In this work, SiC was corroded in sodium carbonate (Na(2)CO(3)) and potassium carbonate (K(2)CO(3)), to form water soluble sodium or potassium silicate. Separation of the transuranics was achieved by dissolving the SiC corrosion product in boiling water. Ceria (CeO(2)), which was used as a surrogate for plutonium oxide (PuO(2)), was not corroded in these molten salt environments. The molten salt depth, which is a distance between the salt/air interface to the upper surface of SiC pellets, significantly affected the rate of corrosion. The corrosion was faster in K(2)CO(3) than in Na(2)CO(3) molten salt at 1050 degrees C, when the initial molten salt depths were kept the same for both salts. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TRISO-fuel element thermo-mechanical performance modeling for the hybrid LIFE engine with Pu fuel blanket	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							COATED-PARTICLE FUEL; HIGH-TEMPERATURE; HTR FUEL; SILICON-CARBIDE; GILSOCARBON GRAPHITE; DIMENSIONAL CHANGES; PYC/SIC INTERFACE; PYROLYTIC CARBONS; SHEAR PROPERTIES; STRESS-ANALYSIS	A TRISO-coated fuel thermo-mechanical performance study is performed for the fusion-fission hybrid Laser Inertial Fusion Engine (LIFE) to test the viability of TRISO particles to achieve ultra-high burn-up of Pu or transuranic spent nuclear fuel blankets. Our methodology includes full elastic anisotropy, time and temperature varying material properties, and multilayer capabilities. In order to achieve fast fluences up to 30 x 10(25) n m(-2) (E > 0.18 MeV), judicious extrapolations across several orders of magnitude of existing material databases have been carried out. The results of our study indicate that failure of the pyrolytic carbon (PyC) layers occurs within the first 2 years of operation. The particles then behave as a single-Sic-layer particle and the SiC layer maintains reasonably-low tensile stresses until the end-of-life. It is also found that the PyC creep constant, K, has a striking influence on the fuel performance of TRISO-coated particles, whose stresses scale almost inversely proportional to K. Conversely, varying the geometry of the TRISO-coated fuel particles results in little differences in terms of fuel performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Treatment techniques to prevent cracking of amorphous microspheres made by the internal gelation process	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							HTR FUEL FABRICATION; ZIRCONIA MICROSPHERES; CERIA; URANIUM; YTTRIA; CEA	The internal gelation process has been used to make plutonium gel spheres and zirconium gel spheres with stabilized yttrium. However, attempts to convert these amorphous gel spheres into kernels have failed due to cracking during the subsequent heat treatments. The porosity of the amorphous microspheres is typically not sufficient to permit the gases that are formed during subsequent heat treatments to escape. The microspheres will crack when the internal pressure becomes too great. In this study, several treatment techniques were applied to zirconium microspheres stabilized with yttrium in an effort to reduce or eliminate cracking. A combination of water washes, a pressurized water treatment at 473 K for 3 h, and a Dowanol PM treatment was shown to eliminate the cracking problem with the zirconium microspheres, which were heated to 1438 K.

Thermodynamic assessment of the LiF-NaF-ThF4-UF4 system	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							QUASI-CHEMICAL MODEL; FUSED SALT SYSTEMS; PHASE EQUILIBRIA; LIF-THF4; FLUORIDE; NA; CS; RB; LI	A thermodynamic assessment of the LiF-NaF-ThF4-UF4 system is presented in this study. The binary phase diagrams are optimized based on the known experimental data and the excess Gibbs energies of liquid and solid solutions are described using a modified quasi chemical model and polynomial formalism respectively. The higher order systems are extrapolated according to asymmetric Toop mathematical formalism. Based on the developed thermodynamic database the fuel composition of the molten salt fast reactor is optimized. In total three different fuel compositions are identified. Properties of these fuel compositions such as melting point, vapour pressure and the boiling temperature are derived from the obtained thermodynamic assessment and are presented in this study.

Remarks on the sintering behavior of UO2-Gd2O3 fuel	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Letter							ATMOSPHERE	The previous work by our group showed experimental evidence that supports the idea that a diffusion barrier is formed around Gd2O3 agglomerates due to the formation of gadolinium-rich (U,Gd)O-2 phases with low diffusivity. This would be the reason for the bad sintering behavior of the UO2-Gd2O3 fuel. The objective of this investigation was to confirm that hypothesis by direct experimental evidence. Analysis of the results showed that the diffusion barrier hypothesis is not applicable. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Durazzo, M.; Saliba-Silva, A. M.; de Carvalho, E. F.

At the same time, these data were made available by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry in the form of a downloadable database. In the process of verifying the consistency of the nuclear data inside the k(0)-IAEA software with these published fundamental databases of recommended k(0)-data, a variety of inconsistencies within and between the two datasets came to light. In this paper, we present the inconsistencies and resolve them where possible.

The samples were irradiated in Apsara and Dhruva reactors, BARC and radioactive assay was carried out using a 40% relative efficiency HPGe detector coupled to an 8k MCA. Concentrations of 23 elements were determined in both SMELS and RMs. In the case of RMs, concentrations of a few elements, whose certified values are not available, could also be determined. The % deviations for the elements determined in SMELS with respect to the assigned values and RMs with respect to certified values were within +/- 8%. The Z-score values at 95% confidence level for most of the elements in both the materials were within +/- 1. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Re-characterization of irradiation facilities for k(0)-NAA at RPI after conversion to LEU fuel and re-arrangement of core configuration	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Ko-Users Workshop	SEP, 2009	Belo Horizonte, BRAZIL			Conversion LEU fuel; Reactor neutron spectrum; Core configuration; k(0)-Based NAA; SMELS	ALPHA	The 1 MW pool-type Portuguese research reactor (RPI) was converted from using highly enriched uranium (HEU) to using low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel in September 2007. Although the new LEU core has the same number of fuel assemblies as the first HEU core, it has three assemblies less than the last HEU core and also has a different arrangement of the beryllium reflectors. Therefore, the primary irradiation positions that are used with the k(0)-based neutron activation analysis (k(0)-NAA) at the RPI were redefined and characterized. The neutron spectrum parameters of the deviation of the epithermal neutron spectrum distribution from the 1/E shape (alpha), the thermal to epithermal neutron flux ratio (f), the thermal to fast neutron flux ratio (f(F)) and the neutron temperature (T-n) were determined by using a combination of Au, Lu, Ni and Zr monitors. The experimental results of the neutron spectrum parameters obtained in this study are compared to the results were obtained prior to the refuel conversion in the applicable irradiation positions. The synthetic multi-element standard SMELS was used to verify the accuracy of k(0)-NAA applied to practical samples using the newly measured neutron spectrum parameters. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, by using a reverse perspective of the problem, the observed U-235-fission and U-238 activation products (along with the k(0)-factors) were used to obtain information about the n(U-235)/n(U-238)(1) isotopic ratio in the samples. The relevant formulae and data-filtering algorithm were implemented in a home-made computer software, allowing automated evaluation and selection of unbiased data. Two radioisotopes (I-131 and La-140) were demonstrated to be reliable candidates for n(U-235)/n(U-238) determination in environmental samples. The accuracy of this method was determined using several isotopic standards varying from a depleted to a highly enriched U-235 content. An overall 2.31 +/- 0.03% overestimation of the isotopic ratio was observed (within 95% confidence level). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Arbocco, F.

Aerosol samples (PM10) have been collected using an aethalometer located at PICO-NARE observatory, in Pico island, from 15 July 2001 to 18 April 2004. The instrument is at an altitude of 2225 m above mean sea level (AMSL), and sampled for 24 h in most cases, and for a few periods continuously. The data herein refer to daily collections of PM10 in the period July 2001-July 2002. Samples were assessed through instrumental neutron activation analysis, k(0)-variant (k(0)-INAA). The lanthanoids and actinoids with concentrations above detection limits and above blank backgrounds were La, Sm, Lu, and Th, U, respectively. Back-trajectory results by the HYSPLIT model have shown that the highest values of La are of African origin, likely related to Saharan-dust episodes, while U comes mainly from northern Europe and North-Central America, down to the Caribbean. Every element presents the same enrichment-factor pattern concerning its annual, summer and winter averages. As for lanthanoids, La and Sm are not enriched relatively to soil while Lu is (actinoids are enriched as well), which indicates preferential enrichment of heavy rare earths compared to the light ones.

The k(0)-based internal monostandard NAA (IM-NAA) using in situ detection efficiency was used to analyze large and non-standard geometry samples of clay pottery, uranium ore and stainless steel. Elemental concentration ratios with respect to Na as a monostandard were used in the study of pottery and ore samples. For stainless steel sample of SS 304L, the absolute concentrations were calculated from concentration ratios by mass balance approach since all the major elements (Fe, Cr, Ni and Mn) were amenable to NAA.

The NRI has had a dominant position in the nuclear programme of the former Czechoslovakia since it was established in 1955. In December 1992 the NRI has been transformed into a joint-stock company. The Institute's activity encompasses nuclear physics, radiochemistry, experiments at the research reactor and many other topics. Main issues addressed in the NRI in the past decades were concentrated on research, development and services provided to the VVER reactors, development of chemical technologies for fuel cycle and irradiation services. Currently, the research activities are mainly targeted to assist the State Office for Nuclear Safety. Significant attention is also paid to the use of nuclear technology outside the nuclear power sector, providing a wide range of services to industry, medicine and the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals. NRI operates 2 research nuclear reactors, hot cell facility, research laboratories, and technology for radioactive waste management, radionuclide irradiators, an electron accelerator and others. After 50 years of activities in the nuclear field, there have been many environmental liabilities that are being remedied in the NRI. There are 3 areas of these remediation activities: decommissioning of old obsolete facilities, processing of RAW resulting from operation and dismantling of nuclear facilities, and elimination of spent fuel from research nuclear reactors. The goal is to remedy the environmental liabilities and eliminate the potential negative impact on the environment. Remediation of the environmental liabilities started in 2003 and should be finished in 2014.

Radioprotection on EPR: comparative presentation of French and Finnish regulatory review process and optimization of the design phase	RADIOPROTECTION			French	Article						EPR; radiation protection; optimization	RADIATION PROTECTION	Radiation protection on EPR: comparative approach of the French and Finnish regulatory reviewing process and optimization at the design phase. Taking the opportunity to evaluate the preliminary safety report of the French EPR reactor built in Flamanville, the IRSN proposes to assess the history of EPR, from the decision to implement studies in the 90s to the French and German cooperation, and finally to the construction of a unit in Finland and in France, and to make a synthesis of the assessment of radiation protection arrangements. This assessment presents the dose targets (calculated reference doses) planned by the nuclear operators in the design phase as well as the global radiation protection optimization process and a comparison of French and Finnish analyses. In France, for example, EDF performed a detailed optimization analysis of selected tasks known to have a major contribution to the annual average collective dose (thermal insulation, logistics, valve maintenance, opening/closing of the vessel, preparation and checks of steam generators, on-site spent fuel management, and waste management). The optimization process is based (in France) on an iterative method. A comparison between the EPR collective dose target and doses received in other pressurized water reactors that are close to the EPR design (Konvoi of German design, French existing units, etc.) is also presented. This synthesis was carried out by the IRSN, the expert body of the French nuclear safety authority, in association with Electricite de France (EDF), the French operator, and the authority for nuclear safety in Finland (sTuK). It summarizes more than 15 years of studies and partnership, focusing on radiation protection, in the design phase of the EPR.

According to French regulation, CEA and CISBIO, who have distributed many sealed sources in the past, have to recover all the disused sources. During 2009, CEA and CISBIO created the "groupement d'interet public (GIP) sources HA", with the objective of recovering and managing high-activity sealed sources (HASS), mainly cobalt-60 and caesium-137, distributed in France. CEA and CISBIO can also recover and repatriate similar sources or any other types of sealed sources distributed by them in foreign countries, when the user has no national solution, or when international organisations, such as the IAEA, identify a security issue. With the objective of optimising this mission, GIP, CEA and CISBIO are ready to cooperate with the present source suppliers who may need the use of hot cells in France, may contribute to some repatriation operations, or may recycle some batches of recovered sealed sources not yet conditioned as waste packages.

Measurement of natural radionuclides and dose assessment of granites from Ondo State, Nigeria	RADIOPROTECTION			English	Article						Natural radionuclides; granite; dose assessment; Ondo State	BUILDING-MATERIALS; RADIOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS; EASTERN DESERT; RADIOACTIVITY; EGYPT; ROCKS	The activity concentrations of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 in fifty granite samples collected from five different quarry industries in Ondo State, Nigeria, were determined using gamma-ray spectrometry. The mean activity concentrations for each industry ranged from 16.7(6.4) to 85.4(23.0), 62.4(10.1) to 113.6(7.6), and 1315(136) to 1551(84) Bq.kg(-1) for Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 respectively. The values in parenthesis are the standard deviations. When compared with results from some parts of the world, the Ra-226 and Th-232 contents were lower, whereas the K-40 content was similar. Using different approaches to estimate the potential radiological hazard of the samples, the results obtained were below the recommended maximum limits. This shows that the radiological hazards associated with the use of the granites examined in this study as building material are within the acceptable limit.	[Ademola, J. A.; Ayeni, A.

French submariners' whole-body counting spectra conducted in the first days following their return to naval base after a patrol on a SSBN clearly display a lower gross activity than when they are living at home. The explanation is quite simple: no source of radon exists aboard. Therefore, the naturally occurring contamination is nearly null. Furthermore, water strongly attenuates cosmic and terrestrial radiation. This leads to an underexposure of the French submariners to natural background radiation. This lack is only partially balanced by the artificial sources aboard.

It can be expected that this program will impact on the current and planned spent fuel and radioactive waste management systems in South Africa. This paper proposes an approach to develop a strategy for the management of PBMR spent fuel that would form an integral part of the overall national radwaste management system. The approach is expected to provide a conceptual spent fuel management strategy and will also highlight areas that need to be further developed, thus providing guidance for basic technology development.

PBMR radionuclide source term analysis validation based on AVR operating experience	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Topical Meeting on High Temperature Reactor Technology	SEP 28-OCT 01, 2008	Washington, DC				REACTOR; RELEASE	The determination of radionuclide source terms is vital for any reactor design and licensing safety evaluation. This paper provides an overview of the PBMR analysis tools with specific focus on the modelling of mobile and deposited radionuclide source terms within the pressure boundary of a typical pebble-bed high temperature reactor (HTR). The main focus is on the Dust and Activity Migration and Distribution (DAMD) software code system that models the activation, migration and time-dependent distribution of dust and atomic particles in an HTR such as the AVR and PBMR. Since DAMD provides a time-dependent systems integrated model of HTR designs, most of the obvious physical phenomena relevant to source terms are at play. These include the neutron flux, activation cross-sections, radioactive decay, dust production rates, dust impurity levels, dust filter capabilities, dust particle size distributions, thermal hydraulic parameters influencing the migration and distribution of particles throughout the main power system and subsystems, and helium coolant leakage and make-up rates. At this stage the DAMD calibration and validation is mainly based on the operational data, experiments and measurements made during 21 years of operating life of the AVR. The comparisons of the DAMD results with various AVR measurements provide confidence in the use of DAMD for the PBMR design and safety evaluations. In addition, sensitivity analyses are performed with DAMD to determine the bounding system parameters that drive the migration and distribution of radionuclides. The use of DAMD to evaluate design configurations, e.g. the effect of the introduction and placement of filters on the radionuclide distribution, is also shown. In conclusion, the importance of a systems modelling approach for radionuclide transport and distribution within the pressure boundary of a typical HTR system, is demonstrated. Since the DAMD code system is calibrated and validated against the AVR measurements it can be concluded that the radionuclide source term phenomena in the AVR, resulting in the measured AVR contamination levels, is taken into account in the design and safety evaluation of the PBMR.

This modification prevents power generation in this central fuel-free zone and decreases temperature gradient across the pebble. Besides particle temperature reduction, the wallpaper concept also enhances neutronic performance through improved neutron economy, resulting in reduced fissile material and/or enrichment needs or providing the potential to achieve higher burn-up. To assess such improvements, calculations were performed using Monte Carlo neutron transport and depletion codes MCNP/MCB. Among others, investigations of conversion ratio, temperature coefficient of reactivity, spent fuel composition and neutron multiplication (for which a method to determine the six-factor formula was developed), were conducted. It is demonstrated that this fuel type impacts positively on the fuel cycle, reduces production of minor actinides (MA) and improves the safety-relevant parameters of the reactor. A comparison of these characteristics with PBMR-type fuel is presented: By comparison with PBMR fuel, the "wallpaper design" results in an effective neutron multiplication coefficient increase (by about 1750 pcm), which is combined with a decrease of between 4.6 and 17.5% in MA production. An improved neutron economy of the heterogeneous design enables enrichment of the "wallpaper type" of fuel to be reduced by more than 6%. The fuel changes suggested in this paper offer more versatility to the HTR concept: Conversion ratio can be decreased (leading to lower MA build-up and fuel reprocessing cost) or raised (leading to lower fuel consumption and fuel cost). Variations around this concept also enable higher reactivity, thus higher achievable burn-up, improving sustainability of HTRs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Marmier, A.; Futterer, M.

The thickness of a copper shell could be fabricated to be as thin as 10 mm with the new method. Around 6 tons of copper could be saved with a 10 mm thick canister compared with a 50 mm thick canister. The electrochemical properties of the cold sprayed copper layer and forged copper were measured through a polarization test. The two copper layers showed very similar electrochemical properties. The lifetime of a 10 mm copper canister was estimated with a mathematical model based on the mass transport of sulfide ions through the buffer. The results showed that the canister lifetime was more than 140,000 years under the Korean granite groundwater condition. The thermal analysis with a current pre-conceptual design of a CANDU spent fuel canister showed that the maximum temperature between the canister and the saturated buffer was below the thermal criteria, 100 degrees C. Finally, the mechanical stability of the copper canister was confirmed with a computer program. ABAQUS, under the rock movement scenario. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The equations, which may be employed to predict the optimal number of columns (generally not integers) for the maximum performance are derived. Accordingly, the best number of columns, which are the integers nearest to, and small than the optimal column numbers, are obtained for practical applications. Considerable improvement in performance is obtainable if the scheme is constructed with the best number of thermal-diffusion columns, instead of using a single column with column height L (N = 1, h = L). This is because that increasing column height in a thermal-diffusion column, though increasing the performance, will decrease the increment in performance, and finally the performance reaches a limiting value.

States of tension metastability may be obtained in tailored resonant acoustic systems such as the acoustic tension metastable fluid detector (ATMFD) system or via centrifugal force based systems such as the centrifugal tension metastable fluid detector (CTMFD) system; both under development at Purdue University. In this paper we describe research results with CTMFD systems for use in the detection of key actinide isotopes constituting special nuclear materials (SNMs) in spent fuel. Tests in a CTMFD system demonstrate the ability to detect alpha activity (at similar to 100% efficiency) of U-isotopes at concentrations of similar to 100 ppb (which is unprecedented and about x100-1000 more sensitive than from conventional liquid scintillation spectroscopy). An inherent capability of TMFD systems concerns on demand tailoring of fluid tension levels allowing for energy discrimination and spectroscopy. This appears especially useful to detect the key isotopes of U and other transuranic isotopes of Pu, Np, Am, and Cm that are at different stages of nuclear fuel reprocessing (i.e., UREX+).

As breeding blanket the first wall of the ITER design is attached to a molten salt zone, in which ThF(4) and UF(4) solute salts are transported by a LiF-BeF(2) solvent salt. For this blanket design, the fissile material is assessed in quantity and quality for both the Th-U and the U-Pu fuel cycle. The transport of the initial D-T fusion neutrons and the reaction rates in this breeding blanket are simulated with the Monte Carlo code MCNP4c2. The isotopic evolution of the actinides is calculated with the burn-up code ORIGEN-S. For the Th-U cycle the bred material output remains below 10 g/h with a (232)U impurity level of 30 ppm, while for the U-Pu cycle supergrade material is produced at a rate up to 100 g/h.

Besides, increase of the primary pressure may result in the opening of the safety valves, consequently leading the release of radioactive isotopes and flammable water gas. The analysis of such a kind of important and particular accident is significant to verify the inherent safety characteristics of the modular HTR plants. Based on the preliminary design of the 200 MWe high temperature gas-cooled reactor pebble-bed modular (HTR-PM), the design basis accident of a double-ended guillotine break of one heating tube and the beyond design basis accident of a large break of the main steam collection plate have been analyzed by using TINTE code, which is a special transient analysis program for high temperature gas-cooled reactors. Some safety relevant concerns, such as the fuel temperature, the primary loop pressure, the graphite corrosion, the water gas releasing amount, as well as the natural convection influence on the condition of failing to close the blower flaps, have been studied in detail. The calculation results indicate that even under some severe hypothetical postulates, the HTR-PM is able to keep the inherent safeties of the modular high temperature gas-cooled reactor and has a relatively good natural plant response, which will not result in environmental radiation hazard.
