Several fuel design concepts are being investigated. Burnup depletion of mixed fuel of uranium and plutonium, cooled with gas in a fast neutron energy spectrum must be simulated. Various codes are being developed and/or adapted to improve the quality of the results, and also to reduce the computing time required for the simulations. The main objective of this work is to compare the fuel depletion results obtained with MCNPX-CINDER-90 code and the new TRIPOLI-4-Depletion(1) code (developed by the Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique) of a fuel design concept for the Gas-cooled Fast Reactor. Calculations were made for an equivalent homogeneous model of fuel rods in a hexagonal mesh assembly. Total reflection conditions were applied on the six lateral faces and the two axial faces of the assembly. The materials used in the fuel assembly are: carbide of uranium and plutonium as fuel, silicon carbide as cladding, and helium gas as coolant. JEFF libraries of effective cross sections were used in both codes. Two methods of burnup step calculations were performed with TRIPOLI-4-D, the Euler and the CSADA, and their results were compared with the MCNPX-CINDER90 CSADA method. A period of 300 days of irradiation time was considered, which was divided into 12 steps. Results of the infinite multiplication factor as function of the irradiation time, and the evolution of the isotope concentrations for a selected group of nuclides were compared. The main conclusion is that very similar results were obtained for the three types of depletion calculations which were compared: (1) MCNPX-C90 CSADA; (2) TRIPOLI-4-D CSADA, and (3) TRIPOLI-4-D EULER. The best calculation time was obtained with the TRIPOLI-4-D EULER method, which needed approximately half the time than the other two. In summary, it is sufficiently good to use the first order approximation (Euler method) for the time dependent fuel depletion simulation of the fast neutronic spectrum GFR fuel studied in this work.

Synthetic model for Doppler broadening of neutron absorption resonances in molecular fluids	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Neutron absorption resonances; Doppler broadening; Molecular motion effects	SCATTERING FUNCTION; CHEMICAL-BINDING; CROSS-SECTION; TEMPERATURE; TRANSMISSION; DYNAMICS; CRYSTAL; CAPTURE; REGION; SAMPLE	A general and systematic approach expressed in modern language, accounting for molecular motion effects on Doppler Broadening of Neutron Absorption Resonances (DBNAR) is given the form of a new model. It relies on well validated hypothesis: The separability of atomic from nuclear degrees of freedom, the use of the Van Hove scattering formalism and the fact that a conceptually identical approach produced experimentally proved predictions when applied to DBNAR in solid systems. We treat the molecular internal degrees of freedom approximately as harmonic oscillators. As a second contribution of this work, a synthetic model is presented in order to make the more complete model mentioned above suitable for neutron calculation codes. This second synthetic model reduces to the exact expressions of the complete model in the low and high neutron energy regimes and provides a plausible transition in between. Numerical results are presented for a general hypothetical case to show its strengths and limitations. Also, both models are applied to a real case of the (238)U 6.674 eV resonant effective broadened absorption cross-section in UF6 (uranium hexafluoride). A direct experimental validation of our models is still necessary for which a special high resolution neutron transmission experiment ought to be devised at low temperatures and pressures on a gaseous system. It is showed how the synthetic model can be used to make thermometric predictions in an improved fashion in comparison to the effective temperature gas model at low temperatures.

FAST REACTORS IN THE ENERGY SECURITY FOR THE STABLE DEVELOPMENT OF RUSSIA	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								New aspects of the development of a future nuclear power system based on the advanced technologies of a closed nuclear fuel cycle with fast-neutron reactors are discussed on the basis of an analysis of systems problems pertaining to present-day nuclear power. The systems requirements ensuring adequate fuel for nuclear power with any installed capacity and maximum use of natural uranium and thorium brought into the fuel cycle are formulated. Sodium-cooled fast reactors, which thus far possess the highest level of technological readiness for commercialization, are given a special role in the formation of a new technological platform for large-scale nuclear power of the 21st century.

J	Schneider, H				Schneider, Horst			Final Storage of High-level Radioactive Waste in Sweden - the Way to the 2009 Siting Decision	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								In Sweden, high-level radioactive waste producing heat, i.e. spent fuel, is to be emplaced for final storage on the site of Forsmark, which also holds three reactor units. The siting decision was taken in June 2009. A 100 percent private company, a merger of the commercial nuclear power plant operators as producers of the waste, is responsible for the siting decision as well as for waste storage. Major impulses were given to the back-end fuel cycle policy in the early 1970s. Sweden practically gave up the reprocessing option very soon, but kept on pursuing final storage in deep geologic formations. Between 1977, when legislation was adopted with conditions relating to repository storage, and 2009, when the decision in favour of the Forsmark site was taken, the path followed was not always a straight line. The boundary conditions, such as the organization of the repository and procedural and safety criteria established by the government, are interesting with regard to their influence on the siting decision, if any. For this reason, the approaches chosen and their connections with government criteria and with geological conditions in Sweden, including their impacts on the repository concept chosen, will be examined. After a summary review of developments in Sweden, filing of the licensing application and the accompanying documents up to commissioning of the repository, a short comparison will be made with the situation in Germany, especially the status reached of the Gorleben salt dome, highlighting and evaluating important criteria and parameters. Sweden as a model is important especially in these respects: A repository site was found by a private company in consensus with the local government within the framework of government criteria, and with ultimate responsibility resting with the government; the local government of a place not winning the siting decision is disappointed although it will have the conditioning plant and receive higher grants; it was not only the geological conditions on the repository site, but the entire repository concept together with other factors which determined the outcome.

J	Risch, R; Doppler, T				Risch, Ralph; Doppler, Thomas			The FAME Drum Measuring System as a Tool for Data Capture for Waste Package Documentation	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								Incipient commissioning of the Konrad repository requires large volumes of radioactive waste to be prepared for final storage and to be declared. Performing these duties within an acceptable period of time needs manpower resources and optimized technical procedures such that standardized data capture allows speedy qualification and documentation of the waste. The FAME drum measuring system ensures complete capture of data relevant to documentation, the performance of quality-assured dose rate measurements and gamma spectrometric measurements, respectively, and export of the data by defined export functions. Capturing documentation-related data about the drums also allows the use of standardized computation methods approved by the authorities. This clearly reduces the expense involved in compiling waste package documentations and their examination by an expert of the Federal Office of Radiation Protection. After a positive outcome of the examination by the expert, the drums so documented can be put into licensed repository packages and prepared for storage in the Konrad repository.

J	Schneider, H				Schneider, Horst			Transports of Radioactive Materials in the European Union - Simplified Procedures or Loss of Safety?	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								The law pertaining to transports of radioactive materials comprises international and national provisions side by side plus regulations under transport law, including different requirements to be met by containers for various goods, and under nuclear law as well as radiation protection law: Radioactive materials in principle are also hazardous goods for the purposes of shipments under transport law. Special requirements apply to each of the different transport systems, i.e. aircraft, ships, railways, and road vehicles. Transports across borders require permits in every country unless exempt from permits. Also supervisory schemes and measures are determined by the laws of the different states. This network of regulations and executive measures, which has grown over decades, could well do with some simplification on an international level. However, steps aimed at harmonization are seen to be difficult. Between November 26, 2007 and January 28, 2008, the European Commission conducted a public consultation to assess possible legislation about transports of radioactive materials within the EU. To preserve the safety and protect the health of workers and the public during transports of radioactive materials within the European Union in accordance with the IAEA regulations in place, increased transparency is to be created for the forwarding agents and users with respect to easy localization of information about regulations to be applied, on the one hand, and harmonization and streamlining of administrative procedures as a key point in the regulation are to be achieved on the other hand. Further deliberations will have to show whether the system so far proposed by the Commission will be able to provide safety in the facts and clarity in European law.									0	0	0	0	0	INFORUM VERLAGS-VERWALTUNGSGESELLSCHAFT MBH	BERLIN	ROBERT-KOCH-PLATZ 4, BERLIN, 10115, GERMANY	1431-5254			ATW-INT J NUCL POWER	ATW-Int.

Deuterium retention of boron-titanium and reduction of deuterium retention after helium ion irradiations	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						Boron-titanium; Titanium-boroid; Boron; Titanium; Deuterium retention; Desorption temperature; Crystal structure; Amorphous	BEHAVIOR; HYDROGEN; BORONIZATION; DESORPTION; FILMS	Deuterium ion irradiations with an ion with energy of 1.7 key were conducted for boron-titanium (B-Ti) film prepared by electron beam evaporation and hot pressed titanium-boride, TiB(2). The amount of retained deuterium was measured for these materials using a technique of thermal desorption spectroscopy. The amount of deuterium retained in TiB(2) was comparable with that in B-Ti. Desorption peaks of deuterium in B-Ti were 470 K and 620K, corresponding to a desorption in the low temperature regime observed in boron (B) and a desorption in titanium (Ti), respectively. The desorption peaks in TiB(2) were 620 K and 750K, which correspond to the desorption in Ti and that in the high temperature regime in B, respectively. The desorption temperature in B-Ti was approximately 100 K lower than that in TiB(2). This difference is discussed based upon chemical bindings and amorphous/crystal structures of B-Ti and TiB(2). Irradiation of helium ion with energy of 5 key was conducted for B-Ti after the deuterium ion irradiation. The amount of retained deuterium decreased and the desorption temperature shifted to the lower temperature regime, as the helium ion fluence increased. The shift to the low temperature regime is due to the enhancement of amorphous structure of B in B-Ti. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Activation analysis and waste management of China ITER helium cooled solid breeder test blanket module	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						Activation; HCSB-TBM; MCNP; FISPACT; SEAFP	FUSION	Activation characteristics have been assessed for the ITER China helium cooled solid breeder (CH-HCSB) 3 x 6 test blanket module (TBM). Taking a representative irradiation scenario, the activation calculations were performed by FISPACT code. Neutron fluxes distributions in the TBM were provided by a preceding MCNP calculation. These fluxes were passed to FISPACT for the activation calculation. The main activation parameters of the HCSB-TBM were calculated and discussed, such as activity, afterheat and contact dose rate. Meanwhile, the dominant radioactivity nuclides and reaction channel pathways have been identified. According to the Safety and Environmental Assessment of Fusion Power (SEAFP) waste management strategy, the activated materials can be re-used following the remote handling recycling options. The results will provide useful indications for further optimization design and waste management of the TBM. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Han, J. R.; Chen, Y.

Experimental design of tritium extraction loop from lead lithium eutectic	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						Tritium extraction; Bubble column; Packed column; ITER; TBM; LLCB	COLUMNS	Effective tritium breeding achievable in Test Blanket Module (TBM) is a major issue for sustainable fusion energy program. Equally important is tritium extraction to recover and recycle tritium back to fusion reactor. Tritium extraction from lead lithium is much more complicated than from purge gas due to low tritium extraction efficiency in transfer step to gas phase and the limitations imposed on space and lead lithium inventory in port cell. Earlier investigations do suggest the preference of packed columns over bubble columns. Theoretical models based on axial dispersion plug flow in liquid and gas proposed for bubble columns and packed columns are reinvestigated for different boundary conditions. This paper highlights the critical issues of experimental design based on tritium extraction efficiency and its impact on recovery loop. Steady state closed loop for absorption and stripping of hydrogen isotopes using inert gas is designed along with the associated auxiliaries. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Synthesis & fabrication of lithium-titanate pebbles for ITER breeding blanket by solid state reaction & spherodization	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						Lithium titanate; TBM; Extrusion; Spherodization; Solid state reaction; SEM; EPMA; Porosity; XRD	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; OPTIMIZATION; LIMN2O4; CELLS; CERAMICS	(6)Li produces tritium by (n, alpha) nuclear reaction, (6)Li + (1)n -> (4)He + (3)H. Lithium titanate (Li(2)TiO(3)) enriched with (6)Li, is the most promising candidate for solid test blanket module (TBM) material for fusion reactors. Various processes are reported in literature for the fabrication of Li(2)TiO(3) pebbles for its use as TBM material. A process has been developed based on the solid state reaction of lithium-carbonate and titanium-dioxide for the synthesis of lithium titanate and pebble fabrication by extrusion, spherodization and sintering. This paper discusses the sequence of steps followed in this process and the properties obtained. Analytical grade titanium-dioxide and lithium-carbonate were taken in stoichiometric ratio and were milled to ensure thorough intimate mixing and obtain fine particles less than 45 mu m before its calcination at 900 degrees C. Following calcination, the agglomerated product was again milled to fine particles of size less than 45 mu m. Aqueous solution of ploy-vinyl-alcohol was added as binder prior to its feeding in the extruder. The extruded strips were spherodized and spherical pebbles were dried and sintered at 900 degrees C for different duration. Pebbles of desired density and porosity were obtained by suitable combination of sintering temperature and duration of sintering. Properties of the prepared pebbles were also characterized for sphericity, pore size distribution, grain size, crushing load strength, etc. The values were found to be conforming to the desired properties for use as solid breeder. The attractive feature of this process is almost no waste generation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Mandal, D.; Shenoi, M. R. K.; Ghosh, S.

RADIATION DOSES AND CANCER RISKS IN THE MARSHALL ISLANDS ASSOCIATED WITH EXPOSURE TO RADIOACTIVE FALLOUT FROM BIKINI AND ENEWETAK NUCLEAR WEAPONS TESTS: SUMMARY	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						cancer; fallout; Marshall Islands; nuclear weapons	THYROID NEOPLASIA; DETONATION; HISTORY	Nuclear weapons testing conducted at Bikini and Enewetak Atolls during 1946-1958 resulted in exposures of the resident population of the present-day Republic of the Marshall Islands to radioactive fallout. This paper summarizes the results of a thorough and systematic reconstruction of radiation doses to that population, by year, age at exposure, and atoll of residence, and the related cancer risks. Detailed methods and results are presented in a series of companion papers in this volume. From our analysis, we concluded that 20 of the 66 nuclear tests conducted in or near the Marshall Islands resulted in measurable fallout deposition on one or more of the inhabited atolls of the Marshall Islands. In this work, we estimated deposition densities (kBq m(-2)) of all important dose-contributing radionuclides at each of the 32 atolls and separate reef islands of the Marshall Islands. Quantitative deposition estimates were made for 63 radionuclides from each test at each atoll. Those estimates along with reported measurements of exposure rates at various times after fallout were used to estimate radiation absorbed doses to the red bone marrow, thyroid gland, stomach wall, and colon wall of atoll residents from both external and internal exposure. Annual doses were estimated for six age groups ranging from newborns to adults. We found that the total deposition of Cs-137, external dose, internal organ doses, and cancer risks followed the same geographic pattern with the large population of the southern atolls receiving the lowest doses. Permanent residents of the southern atolls who were of adult age at the beginning of the testing period received external doses ranging from 5 to 12 mGy on average; the external doses to adults at the mid-latitude atolls ranged from 22 to 59 mGy on average, while the residents of the northern atolls received external doses in the hundreds to over 1,000 mGy. Internal doses varied significantly by age at exposure, location, and organ. Except for internal doses to the thyroid gland, external exposure was generally the major contributor to organ doses, particularly for red bone marrow and stomach wall. Internal doses to the stomach wall and red bone marrow were similar in magnitude, about 1 mGy to 7 mGy for permanent residents of the southern and mid-latitude atolls. However, adult residents of Utrik and Rongelap Island, which are part of the northern atolls, received much higher internal doses because of intakes of short-lived radionuclides leading to doses from 20 mGy to more than 500 mGy to red bone marrow and stomach wall. In general, internal doses to the colon wall were four to ten times greater than those to the red bone marrow and internal doses to the thyroid gland were 20 to 30 times greater than to the red bone marrow. Adult internal thyroid doses for the Utrik community and for the Rongelap Island community were about 760 mGy and 7,600 mGy, respectively. The highest doses were to the thyroid glands of young children exposed on Rongelap at the time of the Castle Bravo test of 1 March 1954 and were about three times higher than for adults. Internal doses from chronic intakes, related to residual activities of long-lived radionuclides in the environment, were, in general, low in comparison with acute exposure resulting from the intakes of radionuclides immediately or soon after the deposition of fallout. The annual doses and the population sizes at each atoll in each year were used to develop estimates of cancer risks for the permanent residents of all atolls that were inhabited during te testing period as well as for the Marshallese population groups that were relocated prior to the testing or after it had begun. About 170 excess cancers (radiation-related cases) are projected to occur among more than 25,000 Marshallese, half of whom were born before 1948. All but about 65 of those cancers are estimated to have already been expressed. The 170 excess cancers are in comparison to about 10,600 cancers that would spontaneously arise, unrelated to radioactive fallout, among the same cohort of Marshallese people.

ACUTE AND CHRONIC INTAKES OF FALLOUT RADIONUCLIDES BY MARSHALLESE FROM NUCLEAR WEAPONS TESTING AT BIKINI AND ENEWETAK AND RELATED INTERNAL RADIATION DOSES	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						dose; internal; fallout; Marshall Islands; nuclear weapons	ISLANDS; IODINE; INGESTION; CS-137; ENVIRONMENT; PLUTONIUM; DOSIMETRY; EXPOSURE; HISTORY; I-131	Annual internal radiation doses resulting from both acute and chronic intakes of all important dose-contributing radionuclides occurring in fallout from nuclear weapons testing at Bikini and Enewetak from 1946 through 1958 have been estimated for the residents living on all atolls and separate reef islands of the Marshall Islands. Internal radiation absorbed doses to the tissues most at risk to cancer induction (red bone marrow, thyroid, stomach, and colon) have been estimated for representative persons of all population communities for all birth years from 1929 through 1968, and for all years of exposure from 1948 through 1970. The acute intake estimates rely on a model using, as its basis, historical urine bioassay data, for members of the Rongelap Island and Ailinginae communities as well as for Rongerik residents. The model also utilizes fallout times of arrival and radionuclide deposition densities estimated for all tests and all atolls. Acute intakes of 63 radionuclides were estimated for the populations of the 20 inhabited atolls and for the communities that were relocated during the testing years for reasons of safety and decontamination. The model used for chronic intake estimates is based on reported whole-body, urine, and blood counting data for residents of Utrik and Rongelap. Dose conversion coefficients relating intake to organ absorbed dose were developed using internationally accepted models but specifically tailored for intakes of particulate fallout by consideration of literature-based evidence to choose the most appropriate alimentary tract absorption fraction (f(1)) values. Dose estimates were much higher for the thyroid gland than for red marrow, stomach wall, or colon. The highest thyroid doses to adults were about 7,600 mGy for the people exposed on Rongelap; thyroid doses to adults were much lower, by a factor of 100 or more, for the people exposed on the populated atolls of Kwajalein and Majuro. The estimates of radionuclide intake and internal radiation dose to the Marshallese that are presented in this paper are the most complete available anywhere and were used to make projections of lifetime cancer risks to the exposed populations, which are presented in a companion paper in this volume.

PROJECTED LIFETIME CANCER RISKS FROM EXPOSURE TO REGIONAL RADIOACTIVE FALLOUT IN THE MARSHALL ISLANDS	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						cancer; fallout; Marshall Islands; nuclear weapons	ATOMIC-BOMB SURVIVORS; THYROID NEOPLASIA; SOLID CANCER; DISEASE	Radioactive fallout from nuclear test detonations during 1946-1958 at Bikini and Enewetak Atolls in the Marshall Islands (MI) exposed populations living elsewhere in the MI archipelago. A comprehensive analysis, presented in seven companion papers, has produced estimates of tissue-specific radiation absorbed dose to MI residents at all historically inhabited atolls from internal (ingested) and external irradiation resulting from exposure to radioactive fallout, by calendar year, and by age of the population at time of exposure. The present report deals, for the first time, with the implications of these doses for cancer risk among exposed members of the MI population. Radiation doses differed by geographic location and year of birth, and radiation-related cancer risk depends upon age at exposure and age at observation for risk. Using dose-response models based on committee reports published by the National Research Council and the National Institutes of Health, we project that, during the lifetimes of members of the MI population potentially exposed to ionizing radiation from weapons test fallout deposited during the testing period (1948-1958) and from residual radioactive sources during the subsequent 12 y (1959-1970), perhaps 1.6% (with 90% uncertainty range 0.4% to 3.4%) of all cancers might be attributable to fallout-related radiation exposures. By sub-population, the projected proportion of cancers attributable to radiation from fallout from all nuclear tests conducted in the Marshall Islands is 55% (28% to 69%) among 82 persons exposed in 1954 on Rongelap and Ailinginae, 10% (2.4% to 22%) for 157 persons exposed on Utrik, and 2.2% (0.5% to 4.8%) and 0.8% (0.2% to 1.8%), respectively, for the much larger populations exposed in mid-latitude locations including Kwajalein and in southern locations including Majuro. By cancer type, point estimates of attributable risk varied, by location, between 12% and 95% for thyroid cancer, between 2% and 78% for leukemia, and between 0.8% and 55% for all cancers combined. The largest projected risks pertain to the Rongelap Island community and the lowest risks pertain to the populations resident on the southern-most atolls. While the projected cancer risks are smaller than those estimated by the National Cancer Institute in a more simplistic analysis conducted in 2004, these estimates of cancer risk are the best available as they are based on the most detailed dose reconstruction to date and comprehensively include populations at all locations and dose contributions from all nuclear tests.

URINARY EXCRETION OF RADIONUCLIDES FROM MARSHALLESE EXPOSED TO FALLOUT FROM THE 1954 BRAVO NUCLEAR TEST	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						excretion; urinary; fallout; I-131; Marshall Islands	IODINE; METABOLISM; SWEAT	Soon after the Bravo nuclear test at Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands on 1 March 1954, urine samples were collected for analysis of excreted radioactivity from native residents exposed to radioactive fallout on two atolls as well as from U. S. military personnel on a third atoll. The earliest acquired samples, obtained by the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL), were assayed for various radionuclides and provided the first known measurements of I-131 in urine following exposure to fallout from a nuclear test. Over the course of 1954, many additional samples were collected by the LASL, as well as by the Atomic Energy Commission New York Operations Office's Health and Safety Laboratory and the Naval Radiological Defense Laboratory. Collectively, the groups sampled included Marshallese exposed on Rongelap and Ailinginae Atolls, American military weather observers temporarily resident on Rongerik Atoll, and sailors from the Japanese fishing vessel, the Lucky Dragon. While the bioassay measurement data and individual urine volumes have been crucial to various attempts to assess intakes of radioactivity and the related internal radiation doses among the Marshallese, those data have never been published in any peer-reviewed journal, but have been restricted to agency memoranda, laboratory reports, and summaries in some publications and book chapters. Reconstructions of internal doses to Marshallese in 1954 and in later years have depended on these data and, hence, they have considerable historical importance as well as importance to ongoing health risk projections for Marshallese. This paper presents much of the original data on urine volumes and radioactivity from the various assays of urine for radionuclides, and compares estimates of I-131 intakes made in 1954, 1985, 1987, and 2008.

ALIMENTARY TRACT ABSORPTION (f(1) VALUES) FOR RADIONUCLIDES IN LOCAL AND REGIONAL FALLOUT FROM NUCLEAR TESTS	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						fallout; Marshall Islands; radionuclide; nuclear weapons	GASTROINTESTINAL ABSORPTION; MARSHALL-ISLANDS; SEA-WATER; RETENTION; URANIUM; PLUTONIUM; METABOLISM; INGESTION; HUMANS; HISTORY	This paper presents gastrointestinal absorption fractions (f(1) values) for estimating internal doses from local and regional fallout radionuclides due to nuclear tests. The choice of f(1) values are based on specific circumstances of weapons test conditions and a review of reported f(1) values for elements in different physical and chemical states. Special attention is given to fallout from nuclear tests conducted at the Marshall Islands. We make a distinction between the f(1) values for intakes of radioactive materials immediately after deposition (acute intakes) and intakes that occur in the course of months and years after deposition, following incorporation into terrestrial and aquatic foodstuffs (chronic intakes). Multiple f(1) values for different circumstances where persons are exposed to radioactive fallout (e. g., local vs. regional fallout and coral vs. continental tests) are presented when supportive information is available. In some cases, our selected f(1) values are similar to those adopted by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) (e.g., iodine and most actinides). However, f(1) values for cesium and strontium derived from urine bioassay data of the Marshallese population are notably lower than the generic f(1) values recommended by ICRP, particularly for acute intakes from local fallout (0.4 and 0.05 for Cs and Sr, respectively). The f(1) values presented here form the first complete set of values relevant to realistic dose assessments for exposure to local or regional radioactive fallout.

PREDICTIONS OF DISPERSION AND DEPOSITION OF FALLOUT FROM NUCLEAR TESTING USING THE NOAA-HYSPLIT METEOROLOGICAL MODEL	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						Marshall Islands; nuclear weapons; fallout; modeling; meteorological	CONTINENTAL UNITED-STATES; RADIOACTIVE PLUME; TEST-SITE; DOLON	The NOAA Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model (HYSPLIT) was evaluated as a research tool to simulate the dispersion and deposition of radioactive fallout from nuclear tests. Model-based estimates of fallout can be valuable for use in the reconstruction of past exposures from nuclear testing, particularly where little historical fallout monitoring data are available. The ability to make reliable predictions about fallout deposition could also have significant importance for nuclear events in the future. We evaluated the accuracy of the HYSPLIT-predicted geographic patterns of deposition by comparing those predictions against known deposition patterns following specific nuclear tests with an emphasis on nuclear weapons tests conducted in the Marshall Islands. We evaluated the ability of the computer code to quantitatively predict the proportion of fallout particles of specific sizes deposited at specific locations as well as their time of transport. In our simulations of fallout from past nuclear tests, historical meteorological data were used from a reanalysis conducted jointly by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). We used a systematic approach in testing the HYSPLIT model by simulating the release of a range of particle sizes from a range of altitudes and evaluating the number and location of particles deposited. Our findings suggest that the quantity and quality of meteorological data are the most important factors for accurate fallout predictions and that, when satisfactory meteorological input data are used, HYSPLIT can produce relatively accurate deposition patterns and fallout arrival times. Furthermore, when no other measurement data are available, HYSPLIT can be used to indicate whether or not fallout might have occurred at a given location and provide, at minimum, crude quantitative estimates of the magnitude of the deposited activity. A variety of simulations of the deposition of fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests conducted in the Marshall Islands (mid-Pacific), at the Nevada Test Site (U.S.), and at the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site (Kazakhstan) were performed. The results of the Marshall Islands simulations were used in a limited fashion to support the dose reconstruction described in companion papers within this volume.

Determination of Activity Concentration Levels of U-238, Th-232, and K-40 in Drinking Water in a Gold Mine in Ghana	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topic; environmental assessment; uranium; water	NATURAL RADIONUCLIDES	The study of the activity concentration levels of uranium, thorium and potassium in drinking water from different locations in a gold mine in the Ashanti Region of Ghana was conducted using gamma spectrometry. The mean outdoor absorbed gamma dose rates at 1 m from the water were 0.524 nGy h(-1), 0.422 nGy h(-1), and 0.252 nGy h(-1) for groundwater, surface water, and treated water, respectively. The results obtained for the activity concentration levels of U-238 and Th-232 are found to be within the maximum acceptable concentration levels of 3.0 Bq L-1 and 0.6 Bq L-1, respectively, recommended by the World Health Organization. The overall mean outdoor gamma dose rate is 0.41 nGy h(-1) and the corresponding outdoor annual effective dose obtained for adult members of the public for drinking water from the mines is 3.58 mu Sv y(-1). This value is found to be within the 10.0 mu Sv per annum (0.01 mSv per annum) for public exposure control set by the World Health Organization. Therefore, the mining activities on drinking water studied did not show any significant radiological health implications on the public.

J	Fisher, SA				Fisher, Susan A.			Small Program, Big Needs	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topics; occupational safety; radiation protection; regulations		Resources are typically scarce in any safety program, but they may be especially limited and difficult to access when the program is relatively small. California State University, Fullerton, has a broad-scope radioactive material license with around ten faculty-users, so while the amount of radioactive material used is not large, its obligation to provide support to those users is. Research is conducted primarily using undergraduate students, so emphasis on safety is paramount. Additionally, when one's duties also include oversight to the biosafety program and support of the hazardous waste program, the ability of a single person to provide what is needed becomes part art, part miracle. I have created a program that conforms to the license's regulatory requirements, while drawing on resources in a variety of places to produce a highly-visible, high-quality program from this one-person office (me). Using humor, respect, good science and good grammar, anyone can get a higher quality, and more compliant radiation safety program than he or she thought possible. This model could be expanded to fit larger programs as well.

Time-Spectral Analysis Methods for Spent Fuel Assay Using Lead Slowing-Down Spectroscopy	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Neutron spectroscopy; nondestructive assay; nuclear fuel cycle safeguards; nuclear fuels	SPECTROMETER; INTERROGATION; FISSILE	Nondestructive techniques for measuring the mass of fissile isotopes in spent nuclear fuel is a considerable challenge in the safeguarding of nuclear fuel cycles. A nondestructive assay technology that could provide direct measurement of fissile mass, particularly for the plutonium (Pu) isotopes, and improve upon the uncertainty of today's confirmatory methods is needed. Lead slowing-down spectroscopy (LSDS) has been studied for the spent fuel application previously, but the nonlinear effects of assembly self shielding (of the interrogating neutron population) have led to discouraging assay accuracy for realistic pressurized water reactor fuels. In this paper, we describe the development of time-spectral analysis algorithms for LSDS intended to overcome these self-shielding effects. The algorithm incorporates the tabulated energy-dependent cross sections from key fissile and absorbing isotopes, but leaves their mass as free variables. Multi-parameter regression analysis is then used to directly calculate not only the mass of fissile isotopes in the fuel assembly (e. g., Pu-239, U-235, and Pu-241), but also the mass of key absorbing isotopes such as Pu-240 and U-238. Modeling-based assay results using this self-shielding relationship indicate that LSDS has the potential to directly measure fissile isotopes with less than 5% average relative error for pressurized water reactor assemblies with burnup as high as 60 GWd/MTU. Shortcomings in the initial self-shielding model and potential improvements to the formulation are described.	[Smith, L.

Signatures and Methods for the Automated Nondestructive Assay of UF6 Cylinders at Uranium Enrichment Plants	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Gamma-ray spectroscopy; neutron measurements; nondestructive assay; nuclear fuel cycle safeguards; uranium enrichment assay		International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors currently perform periodic inspections at uranium enrichment plants to verify UF6 cylinder enrichment declarations. Measurements are typically performed with handheld high-resolution sensors on a sampling of cylinders taken to be representative of the facility's entire cylinder inventory. These measurements are time-consuming, expensive, and assay only a small fraction of the total cylinder volume. An automated nondestructive assay system capable of providing enrichment measurements over the full volume of the cylinder could improve upon current verification practices in terms of manpower and assay accuracy. The 185-keV emission from U-235 is utilized in today's cylinder measurements, but augmenting this "traditional" signature with more-penetrating "non-traditional" signatures could help to achieve full-volume assay in an automated system. This paper describes the study of non-traditional signatures that include neutrons produced by F-19 (alpha, n) reactions (spawned primarily from U-234 alpha emission) and the high-energy gamma rays (extending up to 8 MeV) induced by those neutrons when they interact in the cylinder wall and nearby materials. The potential of these non-traditional signatures and assay methods for automated cylinder verification is explored using field measurements on a small population of cylinders ranging from 2.0% to 5% in U-235 enrichment. The standard deviation of the non-traditional high-energy gamma-ray assay approach was 4.7% relative to the declared cylinder enrichments; the standard deviation of the traditional enrichment meter approach using a well-collimated high-resolution spectrometer was 4.3%. The prospect of using the non-traditional high-energy gamma-ray signature in concert with the traditional 185-keV signature to reduce the uncertainty of automated cylinder assay is discussed.

The ASIC contains seven readout channels, each of which is equipped with the correlated double sampling circuit followed by an amplitude-to-pulse width conversion circuit. We combined the ASIC with an X-ray CCD for performance evaluation tests. We succeeded in processing analog signals from the CCD and confirmed an X-ray imaging and photon-counting capabilities by irradiating a radioisotope (55)Fe. The energy resolution is 305 eV at 5.9 keV (full-width at half maximum) and the readout noise is 53.7 mu V for power consumption of 33 mW per chip. The ASIC proves that the FD-SOI process can be a practically usable option for front-end applications.

Tritium self-sufficiency must be maintained for a commercial power plant. For self-sustaining (D-T) fusion driver tritium breeding ratio should be greater than 1.05. So, working out the systematics of (n,t) reaction cross sections and triton emission differential data are important for the given reaction taking place on various nuclei at different energies. In this study, (n,xt) reactions for some target nuclei as (16)O, (27)Al, (59)Co and (209)Bi have been investigated up to 45 MeV incident neutron energy. In the calculations of the triton emission spectra, the pre-equilibrium and equilibrium effects have been used. The calculated results have been compared with the experimental data taken from the literature.

J	Winterberg, F				Winterberg, F.			Ultradense Deuterium	JOURNAL OF FUSION ENERGY			English	Article						Ultradense deuterium; Thermonuclear ignition	CONFINEMENT FUSION ICF; DENSE DEUTERIUM; RYDBERG MATTER	An attempt is made to explain the recently reported occurrence of ultradense deuterium as an isothermal transition of Rydberg matter into a high density phase by quantum mechanical exchange forces. It is conjectured that the transition is made possible by the formation of vortices in a Cooper pair electron fluid, separating the electrons from the deuterons, with the deuterons undergoing Bose-Einstein condensation in the core of the vortices. If such a state of deuterium should exist at the reported density of about 130,000 g/cm(3), it would greatly facility the ignition of a thermonuclear detonation wave in pure deuterium, by placing the deuterium in a thin disc, to be ignited by a pulsed ultrafast laser or particle beam of modest energy.

Triton Emission Spectra in Some Target Nuclei Irradiated by Ultra-Fast Neutrons	JOURNAL OF FUSION ENERGY			English	Article						Ultra-fast neutron; Geometry dependent hybrid model; Triton emission spectra; (n,xt) Cross-section	REACTION CROSS-SECTIONS; 14-15 MEV N; SEMIEMPIRICAL SYSTEMATICS; FORMULAS; DECAY; 2N	High-current proton accelerator technologies make use of spallation neutrons produced in (p,xn) and (n,xn) nuclear reactions on high-Z targets. The produced neutrons are moderated by heavy water. These moderated neutrons are subsequently captured on (3)He to produce tritium via the (n,p) reaction. Tritium self-sufficiency must be maintained for a commercial power plant. So, working out the systematics of (n,t) reaction cross sections and triton emission differential data are important for the given reaction taking place on various nuclei at different energies. In this study, triton emission spectra by using ultra-fast neutrons (incident neutron energy > 50 MeV), the (n,xt) reactions for some target nuclei as (16)O, (27)Al, (56)Fe, (59)Co, (208)Pb and (209)Bi have been investigated. In the calculations, the pre-equilibrium and equilibrium effects have been used. The calculated results have been compared with the experimental data taken from the literature.

Solubility studies and thermal expansion coefficient of uranium-lanthanum mixed oxide system	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							COMBUSTION SYNTHESIS; FISSION-PRODUCTS; UO2	Uranium-lanthanum mixed oxides (U(1-y) La(y)) O(2 +/- x) (y = 0.1-0.9) of 13 different compositions were prepared by combustion synthesis using citric acid as the fuel. Sintering of the solid solutions was carried out at 1873 K. The solubility limit of La(2)O(3) in UO(2) at 1873 K was determined to be similar to 82% from the room temperature XRD patterns of the sintered samples. However, the solubility limit of La(2)O(3) in the mixed oxides prepared by solid-state route and sintered under identical conditions was found to be similar to 70%. The coefficients of thermal expansion for (U(1-y) La(y)) O(2 +/- x) (y = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8) in the temperature range 298-1973 K determined by high temperature X-ray diffraction (HTXRD) method are 17.7, 18.5, 19.2 and 20.0 x 10(-6) K(-1), respectively.

Thermo-physical properties of DU-10 wt.% Mo alloys	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							URANIUM	Low-enriched uranium alloyed with 10 wt.% molybdenum is under consideration by the Global Threat Reduction Initiative reactor convert program as a very high density fuel to enable the conversion of high-performance research reactors away from highly-enriched uranium fuels. As with any fuel development program, the thermo-physical properties of the fuel as a function of temperature are extremely important and must be well characterized in order to effectively model and predict fuel behavior under normal and off-normal irradiation conditions. For the alloy system under investigation, the available thermo-physical property data is relatively inconsistent and often lacks appropriate explanation. Available literature on this alloy system comes mainly from studies done during the 19605 and 1970s, and often does not include sufficient information on fabrication history or conditions to draw conclusions for the current application. The current paper has investigated specific heat capacity, coefficient of linear thermal expansion, density, and thermal diffusivity that were then used to calculate alloy thermal conductivity as a function of temperature. The data obtained from this investigation was compared to available literature on similar U-Mo alloys, and in most cases are in good agreement. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The project is aimed at the production of inherently protected Pu by the addition of Np-237 to uranium (U) fuel. In order to validate this P-3 concept, two irradiation tests were performed. In the first, a determination of Pu isotopes in Np-237 samples irradiated in the experimental fast reactor JOYO was done to evaluate (PU)-P-238 production from Np-237 under fast neutron spectra. The fast reactor can undertake P-3, which can be better performed in the reflector region. In the test, the percentage of the total amount of Pu-238 atoms transmuted from Np-237 atoms by irradiation was around 90%. In the second test, 2, 5, and 10% Np-containing U samples were irradiated in the Advanced Test Reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) to evaluate (PU)-P-238 production in the thermal neutron region. The fuel specimens were removed from the core at 100, 200, and 300 effective full power days (EFPDs), and then a postirradiation examination was completed at an analytical laboratory in the Materials & Fuels Complex (MFC) at the INL. For the samples after irradiation for 300 EFPDs. Np depletions were about 60% for 2% neptunium (Np)-U samples and about 50% for 5 and 10% Np-U samples. The Pu-238-to-Pu ratios were about 20, 30, and 45% for 2, 5, and 10% Np-U samples. respectively.

However, following the chemical decontamination, a dose rate increase can be seen in some plants after just a few operation cycles. The Hitachi ferrite coating (Hi-F Coat) process has been developed to reduce the recontamination by radioactive cobalt after the chemical decontamination. In this process, a fine Fe3O4 coating film is formed on the stainless steel base metal of the piping following the chemical decontamination in aqueous solution at 363 K. In this study, we investigated a Fe3O4 plating mechanism on the base metal in aqueous solution at 363 K by measurements using a quartz crystal microbalance. We found that the Fe3O4 film grew in three steps. First, the Fe3O4 particles were produced on a stainless steel surface. Second, the Fe3O4 particles grew as dome shapes and the converged domes became filmlike. Third, the film grew and became a closely packed Fe3O4 film.

One of the findings from the TROI experiments is that the results of a fuel coolant interaction (FCI) are strongly dependent on the composition of corium, which is composed of UO2, ZrO2, Zr, and steel. The TEXAS-V simulation for the TROI experiments indicated that a relatively low void fraction seems to have resulted in a strong steam explosion, and the low-voided mixture seems to have been induced by large-sized particles. The particle sizes in the nonexplosive TROT tests were analyzed because the explosive tests do not represent the particles during mixing. The analysis of particle sizes indicated that the debris size reflected the material difference, and the order of the particle size for each melt material was the same as that in the TEXAS-V simulation. The TEXAS-V calculation for the alumina/water system indicated that thermal conductivity is also related to the material effect on the FCI result. A heat loss evaluation using a single-sphere, film-boiling model showed that reliable values for thermal conductivity and particle size provide a reasonable estimation for the FCI result. The steam explosion in corium/water interactions is suppressed by a smaller particle size and an induced larger heat loss during mixing.

The results show that the activity concentrations of (232)Th and (230)Th are in the range of the blank values resulting in an upper limit of theirs activity concentrations in human bones. The presence of (228)Th can be attributed, on the basis of model calculations, to the radioactive decay of deposited (228)Ra. We conclude that thorium is not detectably incorporated into human bones.

Determination of hexavalent and tetravalent uranium in phosphate ores through hydrochloric acid selective leaching	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Determination; Hexavalent uranium; Tetravalent uranium; Phosphate; Leaching		The tetravalent and hexavalent uranium content of three Egyptian phosphate type ore samples namely; Sebayia, Abu Tartur and Qatrani have been studied through selective leaching by hydrochloric acid at normal, oxidized and reduced conditions at an amount of hydrochloric acid less than the stoichiometric value i.e. before phosphoric acid production. Oxidizing condition is attained by incorporating 2% of manganese dioxide in the leaching cycle, whereas reducing condition is attained by adding 2% iron powder. The achieved results show that the amount of tetravalent uranium varies between 5 and 95%. As soon as the achieved stoichiometric value of hydrochloric acid is sufficient to produce phosphoric acid both tetravalent and hexavalent uranium dissolve by virtue of phosphoric acid complexing power for uranium. The chemical form of uranium in the ore determines the type of solvent needed to recover it.

Especially, the surface microstructure and the radionuclide distributions for the spent fuel storage rack were investigated by using a SEM-EDX and gamma-spectrometer for minimizing the matrix effect which could affect a chemical separation process of some beta-emitting radionuclides. The samples were pretreated with a mixed solution of 5 M HCl and 2 M HNO(3) by an ultrasonic surface leaching method. Some radionuclides in the raw racks showed the radioactivity of 10(2)-10(3) Bq for about 10 g of sample weight. From the sample pretreatment, it was confirmed that almost all radionuclides in the rack were completely extracted from the rack when the dissolved thickness of the rack became a maximum 15 mu m by the ultrasonic surface leaching method. The established pretreatment method was applied for all spent fuel storage rack generated from Korean NPPs to determine the scaling factor. The radioactivities of (60)Co and (137)Cs radionuclides in the pretreated solutions were in the range of 4.9E-1 similar to 1.5E+2 and 1.2E-1 similar to 9.0E+0 Bq/g, respectively.

Separation of uranium from different uranium oxide matrices employing supercritical carbon dioxide extraction	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						UO(2); Supercritical CO(2); TBP-HNO(3) adduct; TTA; Simulated waste; Tissue Paper matrix	N-BUTYL PHOSPHATE; FLUID EXTRACTION; NITRIC-ACID; HNO3-TBP COMPLEX; ORGANOPHOSPHORUS REAGENTS; SOLID MATERIALS; DISSOLUTION; CO2; THORIUM; SOLUBILITY	Uranium from different uranium oxide matrices was extracted with tri-n-butyl phosphate-nitric acid (TBP-HNO(3)) adduct using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO(2)). While 30 min dissolution time at 323 K was sufficient for U(3)O(8) and UO(2) powder, UO(2) granule (at 333 K) and crushed green pellet (at 353 K) required 40 min. Crushed sintered pellet required 60 min at 353 K for complete dissolution. Influence of various experimental parameters such as temperature, pressure, volume of TBP-HNO(3) adduct, acidity of nitric acid used for preparing TBP-HNO(3) adduct and extraction time on uranium extraction efficiency was also investigated. For UO(2) powder, temperature of 323 K, pressure of 15.2 MPa, 1 mL TBP-HNO(3) adduct, 10 M nitric acid and 30 min extraction time was found to be optimum. similar to 70% uranium extraction efficiency was obtained on extraction with SC CO(2) alone which increased to 90% with the addition of 2.5% TBP in SC CO(2) stream. Extraction efficiency was found to vary linearly with TBP percentage and nearly complete uranium extraction (similar to 99%) was observed with 20% TBP. Nearly complete extraction was also achieved with addition of 2.5% thenoyltrifluoroacetylacetone (TTA) in methanol. The optimized procedure was extended to remove uranium from simulated tissue paper waste matrix smeared with uranium oxide solids.	[Rao, Ankita; Kumar, Pradeep; Ramakumar, K.

Willow (Salix spp.) and sunflower (Helianthus annus L.) were tested in this experiment with contaminated soil. The enhancing of uranium bioaccumulation was confirmed, but in contrast to previous studies, the highest quantity of uranium was accumulated in leaves. After 5 weeks of citric acid treatment, willow was more efficient in the uptake and translocation of uranium than sunflower. The transfer coefficient calculated for leaves increased from 0.033 (control) to 0.74, or 0.56 after five doses of 5 mmol of citric acid per 1 kg of soil for willow or sunflower, respectively. The uptake characterized by the total U content achieved 88 and 108 mg kg(-1) in relation to the above ground parts of sunflower and willow, respectively. Even though both plants accumulated U in their above ground parts in significant rate, they employed diverse ways to achieve it. At the end of the treatment, the physiological condition of the plants enabled us to continue this method.

Novel fusion method for direct determination of uranium in ilmenite, rutile, columbite, tantalite, and xenotime minerals by laser induced fluorimetry	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Uranium; Refractory minerals; Decomposition; Phosphate flux; Fusion; Laser induced fluorimetry	ICP-OES DETERMINATION; SAMPLE SOLUTION; TA; NB; TI; SN	A simple, rapid, effective and eco-friendly decomposition method is developed for the determination of uranium (U) by laser induced fluorimetry (LIF). The salts of sodium di-hydrogen phosphate (NaH(2)PO(4)) and di-sodium hydrogen phosphate (Na(2)HPO(4)) were used in the ratio of 1:1 (phosphate flux) for the decomposition and dissolution of refractory, non silicate minerals like ilmenite, rutile, columbite, tantalite, and xenotime. The effect of associated matrix elements (Ti, Fe, Nb, Ta, Mn and Y present in the sample) on quenching of uranyl fluorescence was studied. The flux used for the sample decomposition has several advantages. In the reported sample decomposition methods, alpha-hydroxy acids are used as complexing agents to prevent hydrolysis and to get clear and stable solution. This solution can not be directly used for U determination by LIF as alpha-hydroxy acids quench uranyl fluorescence, hence separation is required. In the present method no such separation is required. The flux itself acts as fluorescence enhancing reagent and buffer (maintaining the optimum pH of 7.1 +/- A 0.1). The fused melt of the flux mixture, when disintegrated in water, gives clear and stable solution and has high tolerance for most of inorganic quenchers compared to reported phosphate buffers. Also just by dilution (due to high sensitivity of LIF), the concentration of quenchers could be brought down well within the tolerance limit. The accuracy and precision of the method was evaluated by analyzing Certified Reference Materials (IGS-33 and IGS-34 of Institute of Geological Sciences, UK) and Synthetic Minerals. The accuracy of the data is further evaluated by comparing with standard decomposition methods. The results are well within the experimental error. The RSD of the method is +/- 10% (n = 6) at 10 ppm level for Ilmenite and for other minerals the RSD of the method is +/- 5% (n = 6) at 50 ppm level. The method is being routinely applied to various refractory samples received from Rare Metal and Rare Earth Investigations for determination of uranium by laser fluorimetry.

Nevertheless, the axial position of chloride ions in the complex structure and their weak binding to rhodium centre, due to HSAB concept, make such a complex subject to modifying action of certain sulphuric ligands, like human plasma thiol antioxidants: glutathione and cysteine. Experiments were performed with both radioactive Rh-105 and inactive rhodium. The complexation of rhodium with 1,5,9,13-tetrathiacyclohexadecane-3,11-diol (16S(4)diol) resulted in three distinct peaks seen on UV, radiometric and MS chromatograms. The substitution of chlorides was noted in over 80% of (105)[Rh(16S(4)diol)Cl-2](+) units after incubation with glutathione, and less than 10% of complex units after incubation with cysteine (24 h, 37 A degrees C). Reaction of (105)[Rh(16S(4)diol)Cl-2](+) with 1,8-octandithiol and 1,9-nonandithiol resulted in disappearance of the complex peak and occurrence of two new peaks. Product of RhCl3 and 16S(4)diol reaction is a mixture of three distinct forms having different number of chlorine atoms. Our in vitro experiments suggest that the substitution of axial chlorides with glutathione and cysteine might also occur in vivo in human plasma. Glutathione shows higher reactivity than cysteine in replacement reaction. Axial positions in precursor might be effectively blocked by 1,8-octandithiol and 1,9-nonandithiol.

Radon concentration in groundwater of Varahi and Markandeya river basins, Karnataka State, India	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Radon; Markandeya; Varahi; Radium; Radioactive decay; Maximum contaminant level	DRINKING-WATER; NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; ALLUVIAL AQUIFER; RN-222; REGION; AIR; DISCHARGE; SUPPLIES; TRACER	The present study presents an overview of the distribution of radon ((222)Rn) activity concentration in the groundwater samples and their annual effective dose exposure in the Varahi and Markandeya command areas. Radon measurement was made using Durridge RAD-7 radon-in-air monitor, using RAD H(2)O technique with closed loop aeration concept. The measured (222)Rn activities in 16 groundwater samples of Varahi command area ranged between 0.2 +/- A 0.4 and 10.1 +/- A 1.7 Bq L(-1) with an average value of 2.07 +/- A 0.84 Bq L(-1), well within the EPA's maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 11.1 Bq L(-1). In contrast, the recorded (222)Rn activities in 14 groundwater samples of Markandeya command area found to vary from 2.21 +/- A 1.66 to 27.3 +/- A 0.787 Bq L(-1) with an average value of 9.30 +/- A 1.45 Bq L(-1). 21.4% of the samples (sample no. RMR5, RMR11 and RMR12) in the Markandeya command area exceeded the EPA's MCL of 11.1 Bq L(-1) and it was found that some samples in both the command areas were found to have radon values close to MCL value. The spatial variation in the radon concentration in the Varahi and Markandeya command area were delineated by constructing the contour map. The total annual effective dose resulting from radon in groundwater of both Varahi and Markandeya command areas were significantly lower than the UNSCEAR and WHO recommended limit for members of the public of 1 mSv year(-1).

Improved method for the quantitative determination of ultra trace level of Pu-239+240 in siliceous base samples using microwave assisted dissolution	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Silicious matrix; Microwave; Pu-239+240; SEM-EDS; Alpha spectrometry	PLUTONIUM	Mobilisation of alpha emitting radionuclides from silicious base sample is one the challenging task for environmental radiochemist. During this study, rapid and complete dissolution of the siliceous base samples were carried out by optimizing temperature, pressure and power of the microwaves. The Pu-239+240 in digested samples was pre-concentrated by scavenging Fe as Fe(OH)(3). Pu-239+240 was isolated from the Fe(OH)(3) by co-precipitating Pu with Bi(PO(4)) in HNO(3) medium at pH 2. Pu-239+240 was separated from Bi(PO(4)) and other transuranics by passing through cation and anion exchange resin. Pu-239+240 was counted by alpha spectrometry after electroplating on stainless steel planchet. The detection limits achieved for Pu-239+240 was 60 mu Bq/g (2.6 x 10(-14) g/g). Pu-242 was used as a tracer for the evaluation of recovery of Pu-239+240. Samples prepared after complete destruction of matrix in microwave, showed 10-20% higher concentration of Pu-239+240 compared to conventional acid leached. Consistent recovery in the range of 97-99% for Pu-242 were observed in microwave digested samples whereas inconsistent results were observed in acid leached samples where the recoveries were in the range of 75-86%.

Distribution of the rare earth elements in the surface sediments from the lower Wuding River of China	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Rare earth elements (REEs); Distribution pattern; The Wuding River	GEOCHEMISTRY; TRACE; YANGTZE; AMAZON	The abundance and distribution of rare earth elements (REE) and their signatures in the Wuding River of China were studied from samples of surface sediments and related to the geological formation in its watershed. The total REE (I REE) pound average concentrations of the Wuding River sediments (144.56 mu g g(-1)), is lower than that in the Yangtze River sediments (167.10 mu g g(-1)), getting closer to the values of the Yellow River sediments (137.76 mu g g(-1)), being equivalent to the values of the UCC (the upper continental crust) (146.37 mu g g(-1)). The chondrite-normalized REEs indicated LREE enrichment and flat HREE depletion and also showed a slightly negative Eu-anomaly. A similar chondrite-normalized REE distribution pattern between the Wuding River sediments and Yellow River sediments demonstrated the Wuding River sediments are the important material sources of the Yellow River sediments. UCC-normalized REE patterns between the Wuding River sediments and the Yellow River sediments were almost equivalent and close to the UCC. These implied the Wuding River sediments and the Yellow River sediments are subjected mostly to physical weathering due to higher erosion rates. Consequently, they can be used to trace the UCC compositions.

Collected sediments were generally homogenous mud which contained much more mixture of silt and clay compared to sand and relatively low content of organic carbon (i.e. less than 5% at all sampling stations). The results found that activity concentrations of (230)Th, (232)Th and ratios of (230)Th/(232)Th were ranged from 6.5-20.4 Bq/kg dry wt., 6.8-27.8 Bq/kg dry wt. and 0.69-0.92, respectively. It seem that, (232)Th activity concentrations are slightly higher than (230)Th at all sampling stations and both radionuclides were generally high at Sabah compared to Sarawak coastal waters. (230)Th activity concentrations in sediment core appear to be correlated with the activity concentrations of (232)Th at some sampling station. These indicating both radionuclides were supplied from the same of environment and source origin of detrital from terrestrial and shallower water. The low (230)Th/(232)Th activity ratio which is less than unity suggesting that (232)Th was actively and rapidly regenerated compared to (230)Th from (234)U. It also can be attributed to less efficiently scavenge of (230)Th onto particles prior deposited at the marine sediment bed.

H2O (water) as an O-16 target was irradiated with semi-monoenergetic neutrons generated from the Be-9(p,n)B-9 reaction with 25-35 MeV protons. The neutron flux was obtained with the aid of previous study by Uwamino et al. (Nucl Instr Methods A 271:546, 1988). The tritium activities were measured by using the liquid scintillation counting (LSC) method. The present value for the cross section of O-16(n,t) reaction agrees with previous values measured by using the same LSC method at similar neutron energy ranging from 18.1 up to 33.1 MeV.	[Park, J.
