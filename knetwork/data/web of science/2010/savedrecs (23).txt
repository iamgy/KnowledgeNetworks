J	Kojo, M; Kari, M; Litmanen, T				Kojo, Matti; Kari, Mika; Litmanen, Tapio			The socio-economic and communication challenges of spent nuclear fuel management in Finland The post site selection phase of the repository project in Eurajoki	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Nuclear waste management; Repository project; Perception of local impacts; Communication challenges; Finland		One of the key factors behind the expansion of nuclear energy policy in Finland is nuclear waste management. As in many countries, nuclear waste management agencies are still struggling with the siting of intermediate and low level nuclear waste management facilities, in Finland Posiva, the nuclear waste company owned by the two nuclear power utilities Teollisuuden Voima (TVO) and Fort m Power and Heat (FPH), has been excavating a underground characterization facility since 2004 in the Olkiluoto site in the municipality of Eurajoki. The facility under construction is meant to be for a part of the final repository for disposal of spent nuclear fuel (SNF). The site selection process of the repository was launched in Finland in the early 1980s. The site selection process included different measures to inform and involve local citizens. For example, an Environmental Impact Assessment process was implemented by the nuclear waste company in the late 1990s. The siting process, which proceeded step by step, was successful as in January 2000 the local council of the municipality of Eurajoki approved the siting of the repository by 20 votes to 7. The Council of State made a favourable decision-in-principle (DiP) in December 2000 and Parliament ratified the decision in May 2001. Posiva has also applied for a decision-in-principle to extend the facility. The aim of the paper is to introduce the first observations of the survey focused on local inhabitants. The paper addresses such questions as: What are the main impacts of the repository according to local residents? How can they obtain information about the repository? Which actors are seen as reliable sources of information regarding the final disposal of spent nuclear fuel? The survey was carried out in June 2008. The respondents (N = 3000) were selected from the residents of the municipality of Eurajoki and the neighbouring municipalities using stratified random sampling. The information provided by the survey is important as the municipality of Eurajoki is the very first municipality in the world where the views of local residents on the construction of a repository for the final disposal of spent nuclear fuel could be elicited after the decision of the site selection. The post site selection phase the municipality of Eurajoki is currently experiencing can provide information useful for other countries likely to face this phase in the future. The paper is a part of the co-operation research project of the University of Jyvaskyla and the University of Tampere. The research project "Follow-up research regarding socio-economic effects and communication of final disposal facility of spent nuclear fuel in Eurajoki and its neighbouring municipalities" is funded by the Finnish Research Programme on Nuclear Waste Management (KYT2010).

The Simplified Supercritical Water-Cooled Reactor (SSCWR), a new SCWR design	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						SCWR; New design; Moderation; Zirconium-hydride; Coupled analysis	LIGHT-WATER; CONCEPTUAL DESIGN	The Supercritical Water Cooled Reactor (SCWR) was chosen as one of the Generation IV reactors by GIF. At the moment, a number of concepts exist, such as the American SCWR, the Canadian CANDU-SCWR, the European HPLWR (High Performance Light Water Reactor), the Japanese Super LWR and the Korean SCWR. The driving force behind the developments is the fact that the fossil fired power plants are continuously increasing their efficiency by use of higher pressures and temperatures. The SCWR has numerous advantages over today's wide-spread Light Water Reactors. On the other hand, the scientific community must cope with various challenges before the first power plants of this type can be built. The European and the Japanese concepts are the most promising, although the complicated water flow path repeatedly sets newer challenges. Simplicity is always a good choice in reactor design, thus the authors went back to the basic once-through cycle, significantly improving it. With the combination of zirconium-hydride as extra moderator, axially varying fuel enrichment and moderation, longer active length and smaller core diameter (resulting in thinner walls for the reactor pressure vessel), a new and simpler design is proposed in this paper. This design is called Simplified Supercritical Water-Cooled Reactor (SSCWR) and adapts better for the different operating conditions and burn-up, therefore it is inherently safer and more reliable.

Dose assessment was conducted in terms of internal exposure by breathing and external exposure by radioactive plume, considering the exposure effects resulted from the release of radioactive materials originating in the temporary storage facility for LIM The 13 radionuclides for the internal and external exposure dose assessment were considered: (3)H, (14)C, (55)Fe, (58)Co, (60)Co, (59)Ni, (63)Ni, (90)Sr, (94)Nb, (99)Tc, (129)I, (137)Cs, and (144)Ce. The atmospheric dispersion factors (chi/Q) were derived by the PAVAN code using meteorological data measured in the Kori NPP. The chi/Q value corresponding to the 50 percentile was derived by 4.820E-3 s/m(3) for worker and 2.924E-5 s/m(3) for public. The effective doses resulted from the dropping of drums were in a range of 4.95E-15 to 2.19E-7 mSv for workers and 9.21E-17 to 1.34E-9 mSv for public. The thyroid equivalent doses originating from the dropping of drums ranged from 3.59E-14 to 1.09E-6 mSv for workers and 6.53E-16 to 6.61E-9 mSv for public. On the other hand, the effective doses resulting from fire were in a range of 6.18E-17 to 1.01E-4 mSv for workers and 3.77E-19 to 6.15E-7 mSv for public. The thyroid equivalent doses originating from fire ranged from 4.49E-16 to 5.45E-7 mSv for workers and 2.72E-18 to 3.31 E-9 mSv for public. The exposure doses resulting from the main accidents considered in this study did not exceed the regulatory dose limits with respect to arbitrary accidents originating in the temporary storage facility for LILW management.

Performance and radiological analyses of a space reactor power system deployed into a 1000-3000 km earth orbit	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Space reactor; Fast neutron spectrum; NaK-78 coolant; SCoRe space reactor; Decay heat; Earth orbits	MISSIONS; ENERGY; LOOP	This paper presents the results of performance and radiological analyses of a space reactor power system to support space-based, radar satellites in a 1000-3000 km orbit for global civilian air and ocean traffic control. The power system with six primary and secondary loops to avoid single point failures in reactor cooling and energy conversion employs a sectored, liquid NaK-78 cooled fission reactor that has a negative temperature reactivity feedback and SiGe thermoelectric energy conversion modules, nominally generating 37.1 kW(e) for up to 6 years. The reactor nominally generates 1183.6 kW(th) at an exit temperature of similar to 992 K. Thermoelectric-electromagnetic (TEM) pumps circulate the liquid NaK-78 in the primary and secondary loops and passively remove the decay heat from the reactor core after shutdown. The system parameters during the startup and shutdown transients and nominal steady-state operation are calculated. The effects of the period of incrementally inserting external reactivity on the system parameters during nominal operation are also investigated. The radioactivity buildup in the reactor during nominal operation up to 6 years and the decay in radioactivity after shutdown and as a function of storage time in orbit up to 1000 years are calculated.

In this work we propose GreeNN, a hybrid system composed by a simple greedy search technique and a neural network that allows approaching the solution of both problems in a coupled way. Firstly, GreeNN performs the radial optimization of the fuel assembly (minimizing the Local Power Peaking Factor according to a 2D simulation) and then, the obtained fuel lattice is added to a fuel lattices inventory. This inventory is used to solve the axial optimization of the fuel assembly where a 3D core simulator is used to make a Haling calculation at the end of the cycle and to estimate the generated energy. The method proceeds iteratively, with the aim of decreasing the uranium enrichment of the designed fuel lattices in the radial stage while keeping the energy requirements. GreeNN system was applied to design the fuel lattices for an equilibrium cycle of 18 months. The fuel assembly's performance proposed by GreeNN system was better than the reference case, without jeopardizing the reactor safety. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The works in SK Cyclotron Center are distinguished into three procedures including production, dispensation, and carry of the compound. As the medical cyclotron was operated to produce the radioactive compounds, secondary radiations such as neutrons and gamma-rays were also induced. To estimate the exposure for the staffs working in the SK Cyclotron Center, the dual-TLD (TLD-600/700) chips were used to measure the doses contributed from photons and neutrons during the operation of the cyclotron, and the doses contributed from photons during dispensation and carry of the nuclear compounds. In the results, the mean H(p)(10) and H(p)(0.07) of the finger for a worker were 2.11 mSv y(-1) and 96.19 mSv y(-1), respectively. Results estimated by the regular personal chest badges and finger ring dosimeters which considered only the doses of photons were compared. By means of the results of this work, doses contributed from different working procedures and from different types of radiation to the workers in the SK Cyclotron Center were realized.

Performance testing and dose verification for extremity ring dosimetry	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th European Conference on Luminescent Detectors and Transformers of Ionizing Radiation	JUL 12-17, 2009	Cracow, POLAND	Polish Acad Sci, Inst Nucl Phys		Personal dose equivalent H(p)(0.07); Performance testing; Extremity ring dosimeter; Monte Carlo method; Nuclear medicine		The paper describes the testing performed on an extremity dosimetry system to measure the personal dose equivalent H(p)(0.07) in photon and beta reference fields. This research refers to the American National Standard Institute (ANSI) N13.32 standard (1995) to organize the performance testing for the INER's TLD-100H extremity ring dosimeters. The results show that tolerance level (L), absolute of bias (vertical bar B vertical bar) and standard deviation (S) for all categories of performance testing meet the ANSI N13.32 performance testing criteria. The performance testing results were suggested to be an important step of an accreditation procedure for the extremity ring dosimetry system in Taiwan. Besides, the dose evaluation of extremity ring dosimeters to measure H(p)(0.07) in realistic fields of nuclear medicine is also verified. The reference values of H(p)(0.07) were calculated using the Monte Carlo method normalized by the measured activity of the radioactive solution. For nuclear medicine irradiations the relative response to (201)Tl and (99m)Tc radionuclides produced by INER are also satisfactory. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Hsu, S.

Thermoluminescent method for the measurements of tritium production in neutronics experiments	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th European Conference on Luminescent Detectors and Transformers of Ionizing Radiation	JUL 12-17, 2009	Cracow, POLAND	Polish Acad Sci, Inst Nucl Phys		Tritium; Neutron activation, Lithium fluoride; LSC	LIF-MG,CU,P	A European nuclear-fusion technology program is currently, except of other acivities, on the stage of validating the capability of neutronic codes and nuclear data for use in the ITER project. This requires a technique for reliable measurements of tritium produced by a neutron flux and these estimates must have a qualified uncertainty. The application of LiF TL detectors, calibrated by the direct measurement of tritium activity using the Liquid Scintillation Counting (LSC) technique, is a new approach to the assessment of the tritium production rate in fusion related benchmark experiments. Lithium Fluoride Thermoluminescent Detectors (TLD) are commonly used for measurements of thermal neutron dose using the (6)Li(n,alpha)(3)H reaction. The accumulation of radioactive tritium in the LiF detectors is usually considered as an undesired effect to the detectors, increasing intrinsic background after high-dose neutron exposure. The same effect may be exploited for the measurement of generated tritium activity. A TL signal corresponding to the energy deposited in the (-)beta decay of (3)H, expressed as mGy/h to be recalculated to Bq/mg, requires calibration by an independent measurement of (3)H activity. This calibration can be performed by applying e.g. LSC-technique. A good correlation was obtained in the tested range of tritium activity: 17-25 Bq/mg of LiF (0.080-0.118 mGy/h) with a slope of regression line: 1.75 x 10(-4) [mGy/h]/[Bq], r(2) = 0.94. The thermal treatment of the TLDs after irradiation (annealing: 400 degrees C, 1 h) leads to a loss of 37% of the initial tritium content. Prolonged storage of the irradiated TLDs at room temperature, pressure and humidity causes the escape of less than 5% of the accumulated tritium after 100 days. Thus LiF TLDs after calibration can be used as one of techniques for the assessment of tritium production in neutronic experiments. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Especially the applications concern reduced molecular weight chitosan which still retain its chemical structure; such form of the compound is fostering biological, physical and chemical reactivity of the product. Chitosan degrades into fragments under gamma-ray or electron beam irradiation. Antibacterial properties of the product are applied in manufacturing hydrogel for wound dressing and additional healing properties can be achieved by incorporating in the hydrogel matrix chitosan bonded silver clusters. Another possible application of chitosan is in reducing radiation damage to the radiation workers or radiation cured patients. In the case of radioisotopes oral or respiratory chitosan-based materials can be applied as chelators. Applications of chitosan in oncology are also reported. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, papain presents low stability, which limits its use to extemporaneous or short shelf-life formulations. The purpose of this study was to entrap papain into a polymeric matrix in order to obtain a drug delivery system that could be used as medical device. Since these systems must be sterile, gamma radiation is an interesting option and presents advantages in relation to conventional agents: no radioactive residues are formed: the product can be sterilized inside the final packaging and has an excellent reliability. The normative reference for the establishment of the sterilizing dose determines 25 kGy as the inactivation dose for viable microorganisms. A silicone dispersion was selected to prepare membranes containing 2% (w/w) papain. Irradiated and non-irradiated membranes were simultaneously assessed in order to verify whether gamma radiation interferes with the drug-releasing profile. Results showed that irradiation does not affect significantly papain release and its activity. Therefore papain shows radioresistance in the irradiation conditions applied. In conclusion, gamma radiation can be easily used as sterilizing agent without affecting the papain release profile and its activity onto the biocompatible device is studied. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods for spectral interference corrections for direct measurements of U-234 and Th-230 in materials by gamma-ray spectrometry	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							HIGHLY ENRICHED URANIUM; AGE; THORIUM	When the high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometry was used in the analysis of U-234 and Th-230 in samples, there is a much more need to correct for the measured activity results of U-234 and Th-230 mainly due to self-absorption effects and the interfering lines from Ra-226, U-235, U-238 and their decay products that often might be present in the samples. Therefore, in the present study, the methods for the spectral interference corrections for the analytical peaks of U-234 and Th-230 are suggested to take into account the contributions of the overlapping gamma rays to these peaks. For the method validation, direct gamma-ray spectrometric measurements were carried out using certified reference materials (CRM) by use of a 76.5 % n-type Ge detector. The activities measured for the CRM samples were corrected for spectral interferences, self-absorption and true coincidence-summing (TCS) effects. The obtained results indicate that ignoring of the contribution of the interference gamma rays to the main analytical peak at 53.2 keV of U-234 leads to a lager systematic error of 87.3-90.4 % for the measured activities of U-234, and similarly if one ignores the contributions of the interference gamma rays to the main analytical peak at 67.7 keV of Th-230, this leads to a much smaller systematic error of 2.1-2.7 % for the activities of Th-230. Therefore, the required correction factors for spectral interferences to the analytical peaks of U-234 and Th-230 are not negligible and thus they should also be considered besides necessary self-absorption factors to determine more accurate activities in the samples. On the other hand, it is estimated that although the TCS effects on the main analytical peaks of both U-234 and Th-230 are negligibly small, those TCS correction factors for their interference gamma rays to these peaks should be taken into account when direct measurements are performed in a close-counting geometry condition. Otherwise, the resulted activities can have serious erroneous results for both U-234 and Th-230 while using gamma-ray spectrometry, thereby leading to inaccuracies in their derived quantities, for instance, the corresponding age determinations of the samples.

Measurement of natural and artificial radioactivity in powdered milk consumed in Jordan and estimates of the corresponding annual effective dose	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							GAMMA-RAY SPECTROMETRY; SAMPLES; SOIL; RADIOCESIUM; CS-137; K-40; RADIOSTRONTIUM; FALLOUT; SR-90	The activity concentrations of (40)K, (226)Ra, (228)Ra and (137)Cs were measured for 14 brands of the powdered milk consumed in Jordan, which are imported from various regions around the world. The activity concentrations of (40)K were found not to vary greatly from one brand to the other with an average of 348 +/- 26 Bq kg(-1). However, the activity concentrations of (137)Cs revealed a geographical distribution being: (i) undetected in any of the samples from Argentina, (ii) uniformly distributed in samples from Europe with an average of 0.43 +/- 0.05 Bq kg(-1), and (iii) widely varying in samples from New Zealand (from being not detected (ND) to 1.55 Bq kg(-1)). (226)Ra and (228)Ra were measured above the detection limits in five brands only and displayed relatively low activity concentrations of 0.50-2.14 and 0.78-1.28 Bq kg(-1) for (226)Ra and (228)Ra, respectively. The total average annual effective doses due to intake of (40)K, (226)Ra, (228)Ra and (137)Cs from the ingestion of the powdered milk for infants, children and adults were estimated to be (in mu Sv): 332, 138 and 43, respectively. These results indicate no significant radiation dose to the public.

Determining minimum alarm activities of orphan sources in scrap loads; Monte Carlo simulations, validated with measurements	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Monte Carlo; Portal monitors; Scrap metal; Alarm threshold	RADIATION PORTAL MONITORS; DETECTORS	Portal monitoring radiation detectors are commonly used by steel industries in the probing and detection of radioactivity contamination in scrap metal. These portal monitors typically consist of polystyrene or polyvinyltoluene (PVT) plastic scintillating detectors, one or more photomultiplier tubes (PMT), an electronic circuit, a controller that handles data output and manipulation linking the system to a display or a computer with appropriate software and usually, a light guide. Such a portal used by the steel industry was opened and all principal materials were simulated using a Monte Carlo simulation tool (MCNP4C2). Various source-detector configurations were simulated and validated by comparison with corresponding measurements. Subsequently an experiment with a uniform cargo along with two sets of experiments with different scrap loads and radioactive sources ((137)Cs, (152)Eu) were performed and simulated. Simulated and measured results suggested that the nature of scrap is crucial when simulating scrap load-detector experiments. Using the same simulating configuration, a series of runs were performed in order to estimate minimum alarm activities for (137)CS, (60)Co and (192)Ir sources for various simulated scrap densities. The minimum alarm activities as well as the positions in which they were recorded are presented and discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This device, with an angular coverage of 0.45-9.5%degrees, produces a spatial separation between the fusion products and the intense background of elastically scattered beam particles. Its high efficiency allows precise measurement of nuclear fusion cross-sections, as well as being ideal for evaporation residue coincidence measurements. The essential features of the system and the first results obtained are described. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Rodriguez, M. D.; Brown, M. L.; Dasgupta, M.; Hinde, D. J.; Weisser, D.

After discussing various topics of nuclear astrophysics and reactor physics where the demand of nuclear data on unstable nuclei is strong, we describe the general characteristics of the targets needed to measure the requested data. In some cases the half-life of the nucleus of interest is so short that it is not possible to produce a target and perform the measurement. However, some alternative methods have been developed that allow one to obtain neutron-induced cross sections of highly radioactive nuclei. One of these methods is the surrogate reaction technique. We explain the principle of the surrogate method and describe the characteristics of the targets used in surrogate experiments. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

High-purity samples and targets of radioactive materials required for measurements of cross-sections and studies of fission fragments or fuel elements were prepared by the IRMM's target group by means of various techniques reviewed in this presentation. Applying these techniques the target group had been preparing targets of U, Pu, Np, Am, Th for in-house physicists and for external customers. Recently, after a long process of decontamination and refurbishment of the old equipment, custom-made (233)U and (235)U targets were prepared by electro-deposition and by high-vacuum evaporation. Other actinide targets (U, Th) have been prepared using mechanical reshaping techniques. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The project aims to be a joint CNRS-CEA national laboratory to overcome difficulties related mainly to safety issues and to the lack of knowledge and potential manpower. The first goal is to fulfill, at least, the needs of the whole French community, and to be able to coordinate the different activities related to radioactive targets. For this purpose, itis important to be complementary to already existing international installations. Inside this framework, it will of course be possible to produce and/or characterize targets for other users. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Bacri, C.

For fission yield measurements relatively thin targets (tens of mu g/cm(2)) are used, while for nuclear spectroscopy applications targets up to 1 mg/cm(2) are employed. This leads to fission rates up to 5 x 10(12)/s. The targets are heated by the fission power in vacuum to temperatures of up to 1000 degrees C. The radiation damage caused by the fission fragments can reach 50 dpa (displacements per atom) per day, an extremely high value comparable to that caused by irradiation with intense heavy ion beams. Therefore the thick targets that were produced with different methods (painting, spray-painting, electrolysis and molecular plating) all suffer from a burnup that is much quicker than explainable by nuclear transmutation. We discuss physical effects responsible for this additional decrease in fission fragment rate and ways to improve the situation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two of these accelerators, TR30-1 and TR30-2, can deliver H(-) beams of 30 MeV and beam currents in excess of 1000 mu A. For many years, in-house produced diamondlike carbon (DLC) foils of approximately 2.0-3.0 mu m thickness have been utilized to extract proton beams from these accelerators. The TRIUMF Carbon Foil Laboratory uses pulsed laser deposition to manufacture DLC films in a wide thickness range (10 nm to similar to 10 mu m). It is known that the quality and the composition of the graphite sputter target used in the laser ablation process has a significant effect on the mechanical properties of the deposited film as well as its durability in ion beams. Encouraged by the findings of Sugai et al. [1], we investigated the production of stripper foils by laser ablation of graphite/boron composites as well as multilayer foils using pure graphite and boron targets. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Multi-layer polymer coated C-foils (PCC-foils) of 300 mu g/cm(2) carbon thickness were irradiated by a 11 MeV/nucleon (238)U(35+) beam and their lifetimes were measured. Using an atomic force microscope (AFM) and an electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA), it was observed that the surface property and cross-sectional image of the PCC-foils had changed after the irradiation. A rotating-cylinder stripper device, which was developed to further increase the lifetime of C-foils, was also tested. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In 1941 (year of birth of the author) large-scale development for uranium isotope separation was started after the US authorities were warned that NAZI Germany had started its program for enrichment of uranium and might have confiscated all uranium and uranium mines in their sphere of influence. Within the framework of the Manhattan Projects the first electromagnetic mass separators (Calutrons) were installed and further developed for high throughput. The military aim of the Navy Department was to develop nuclear propulsion for submarines with practically unlimited range. Parallel to this the army worked on the development of the atomic bomb. Also in 1941 plutonium was discovered and the production of (239)Pu was included into the atomic bomb program. (235)U enrichment starting with natural uranium was performed in two steps with different techniques of mass separation in Oak Ridge. The first step was gas diffusion which was limited to low enrichment. The second step for high enrichment was performed with electromagnetic mass spectrometers (Calutrons). The theory for the much more effective enrichment with centrifugal separation was developed also during the Second World War, but technical problems e.g. development of high speed ball and needle bearings could not be solved before the end of the war. Spying accelerated the development of uranium separation in the Soviet Union, but also later in China, India, Pakistan, Iran and Iraq. In this paper, the physical and chemical procedures are outlined which lead to the success of the project. Some security aspects and Non-Proliferation measures are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

But spent fuel from nuclear power plants has become one of the crucial problems of nuclear energy exploitation. Some problems attributed to the conventional nuclear power reactors along with their solutions and a historical transition from nuclear power reactors to accelerator-driven systems are briefly reviewed in the present work. It is argued that accelerator-driven systems (ADS), for transmutation of nuclear waste and energy production, are good alternatives to the conventional nuclear power plants. Important differences between the conventional nuclear reactors and the ADS along with the ADS physics are discussed. The ADS is considered to be relatively safe as compared to the other nuclear power reactors commonly in use. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Crystal chemistry of immobilization of fast breeder reactor (FBR) simulated waste in sodium zirconium phosphate (NZP) ceramic matrix	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							THERMAL-EXPANSION; RADIOACTIVE-WASTES; FAMILY; REFINEMENT; NUCLEAR	Fuel from the fast breeder reactor waste is reprocessed and subjected to cooling for a period of about one year. Fission and activation products of the fuel are the major constituents of this waste. Sodium zirconium phosphate (hereafter NZP) has been identified as a potential material for immobilization of long lived heat generating radio nuclides. It was found that most of the elements present in the radioactive waste could be immobilized in this ceramic matrix without significant changes of the three-dimensional framework of the host material. Simulated NZP waste forms synthesized by ceramic route at 1200 degrees C crystallize in the rhombohedral system (space group R-3c). The crystal chemistry of 0-35 wt.% waste loaded NZP waste forms have been investigated using General Structure Analysis System (GSAS) programming of the step analysis powder diffraction data. Rietveld refinement of crystal data on the waste oxide (WO,) loaded waste forms gives a satisfactory convergence of R-factors. The particle size along prominent reflecting planes ranges between 68 and 141 nm. The polyhedral distortions and effective valence calculations from bond strength data are also reported. Morphological examination by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveals that the size of almost rectangular parallelepiped shaped grains varies between 0.2 and 5 mu m. The EDX analysis provides analytical evidence of immobilization of effluent cations in the matrix. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Chourasia, Rashmi; Shrivastavaa, O.

A national radiation disaster countermeasure organization was set up to cope with the radiation emergency classified into three cases whose effective doses were more than 1 mSv/h inside the nuclear facility, inside the site boundary and outside the site boundary. Its role consists of the proclamation and consequent withdrawal of a disaster, a general assessment, an emergency medical service, a field control, radiation protection, resident protection implement, an accident analysis, a security plan, a radiation environmental investigation plan and probe, a radiation environmental effect assessment, and others. The emergency planning zone (EPZ) was settled to be within a radius of 800 m, the average distance between the site boundary and the center of a research reactor in operation, as a quick and effective early countermeasure from the result of the radiation environmental effect assessment. The environmental probing zone was chosen to extend to a radius of 2 km from a research reactor according to the moving path of the radioactive cloud so that a densely populated area could be considered and would be extended to 10 km according to the radiation level of the research reactor and atmospheric diffusion. Practically, the environmental probing is implemented at 22 points inside the site and eight points outside the site considering the geography, population and the wind direction. The gamma radiation dose and atmospheric radioactivity are analyzed during an effluence, and the radioactivity of a ground surface deposit and an environmental sample are analyzed after an effluence. The environmental laboratory covers the analysis of the gamma radioisotopes, tritium, strontium, uranium, gross alpha and beta. It is estimated that the habitability can be recovered when the radiation dose rate is less than I mSv/h inside the site and around the environmental laboratory with the no sign of an effluence of the radioactive material. As a conclusion, it is thought that this emergency countermeasure system is effective in a real radiation emergency situation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ronen, Y; Golyand, L; Shwageraus, E				Ronen, Yigal; Golyand, Leonid; Shwageraus, Eugene			The potential use of Am-241 as proliferation resistant burnable poison in PWRs	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							FUEL-CYCLE OPTIONS; DENATURED PLUTONIUM; WATER-REACTORS	This paper discusses the use of Am-241 as proliferation resistant burnable poison for light water reactors. Homogeneous addition of small (as little as 0.12%) amounts of Am-241 to the conventional light water reactor fuel results in significant increase in Pu-238/Pu ratio in the discharged fuel improving its proliferation resistance. Moreover Am-241, admixed to the fuel, acts as burnable absorber allowing for substantial reduction in conventional reactivity control means without a notable fuel cycle length penalty. This is possible due to favorable characteristics of Am-241 transmutation chain. The fuel cycle length penalty of introducing Am-241 into the core is evaluated and discussed, as well as the impact of He production in the fuel pins and degradation of reactivity feedback coefficients. Proliferation resistance and reactivity control features related to the use of Am-241 are compared to those of using Np-237, which has also been suggested as an additive to the conventional fuel in order to improve its proliferation resistance. It was found that Am-241 admixture is more favorable than Np-237 admixture because of the smaller fuel cycle length penalty and higher burnable poison savings. Addition of either Np-237 or Am-241 would provide substantial but not ultimate protection from misuse of Pu originating in the spent fuel from the commercial power reactors. Therefore, the benefits from application of the concept would have to be carefully evaluated against the additional costs and proliferation risks associated with manufacturing of Np-237 or Am-241 doped fuel. Although this work concerns specifically with PWRs, the conclusions could also be applied to BWRs and, to some extent, to other thermal spectrum reactor types. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Optimization of depleted uranium bundle loading in fresh core of Indian PHWR by evolutionary algorithm	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							FUEL-MANAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; FULL POWER	This paper is concerned with the Indian design of a 220 MWe pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR) having natural uranium (NU) fuel and heavy water as moderator and coolant. At the beginning of life, it is necessary to flatten the power by loading some depleted uranium (DU) bundles to achieve a nearly full power operation. The determination of best possible locations of DU bundles, which maximize fuel economy as well as safety, is a large-sized combinatorial optimization problem with constraints. In the past, 384 DU bundles have been loaded in locations determined by manual intuition in an Indian PHWR and maximum permissible power of 93% full power (FP) was obtained. In the present paper, a modern evolutionary algorithm called estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is used to improve upon this distribution. Optimum distributions of DU bundles which maximize K(eff) and give 100% FP without violating safety parameters such as maximum permissible bundle power, channel power, channel outlet temperature and permitted reactivity worths of shut-down systems are obtained. Another aspect studied in this paper is to find out how far one can increase the number of DU bundles loaded in the core. This will minimize the NU bundles requirement, extract more power from DU bundles and thus provide better fuel utilization. The idea is to conserve NU bundles. The optimum distribution of DU bundles has been obtained for the total number of DU bundles ranging from a few hundreds to a few thousands. It is found that, depending on various conditions, about 60-80% of the core can be loaded with DU bundles leading to a substantial saving in NU bundles. Some variation in the implementation of EDA to generate loading pattern of PHWR reactor core is also studied. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Such are the effective delayed neutron fraction, beta(eff), and mean neutron generation time, Lambda. We calculate beta(eff) and Lambda for various realistic and hypothetical annular TRIGA Mark II cores with different types and amount of fuel. It is observed that the effective delayed neutron fraction strongly depends on the number of fuel elements in the core or on the core size. beta(eff) varies for 12 wt.% uranium standard fuel with 20% enrichment from 0.0080 for a small core (43 fuel rods) to 0.0070 for a full core (90 fuel rods). It is found that calculated value of beta(eff) strongly depends also on the nuclear data set used in calculations. The prompt neutron lifetime mainly depends on the amount (due to either content or enrichment) of (235)U in the fuel as it is approximately inversely proportional to the average absorption cross-section. It varies from 28 mu s for 30 wt.% uranium content fuelled core to 48 mu s for 8.5 wt.% uranium content LEU fuelled core. Description of the calculation method and detailed results are presented in the paper. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Maldonado, GI; Galloway, J; Hernandez, H				Maldonado, G. Ivan; Galloway, Jack; Hernandez, Hermilo			Recycling heterogeneous americium targets in a boiling water reactor	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								One of the limiting contributors to the heat load constraint for a long term spent fuel repository is the decay of americium-241. A possible option to reduce the heat load produced by Am-241 is to eliminate it via transmutation in a light water reactor thermal neutron environment, in particular, by taking advantage of the large thermal fission cross section of Am-242 and Am-242m. In this study we employ lattice loading optimization techniques to define the loadings and arrangements of fuel pins with blended americium and uranium oxide in boiling water reactor bundles, specifically, by defining the incineration of pre-loaded americium as an objective function to maximize americium transmutation. Subsequently, the viability of these optimized lattices is tested by assembling them into bundles with Am-spiked fuel pins and by loading these bundles into realistic three-dimensional BWR core-wide simulations that model multiple reload cycles and observe standard operational constraints. These simulations are possible via our collaboration with the Westinghouse Electric Co. which facilitates the use of industrial-caliber design tools such as the PHOENIX-4/POLCA-7 sequence and the Core Master 2((C)) GUI work environment for fuel management. The resulting analysis confirms the ability to axially uniformly eliminating roughly 90% of the pre-loaded inventory of recycled Am-241 in BWR bundles with heterogeneous target pins. This high level of incineration was achieved within three to four 18-month operational cycles, which is equivalent to a typical in-core residence time of a BWR bundle. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The structural investigation of the material was carried out using X-ray diffraction, surface area determination, FTIR and TEM micrograph analysis. Various experimental parameters were optimized to separate Re-188 from W-188. The capacity of the material was found to be similar to 325 mg W/g at the optimum pH. A chromatographic W-188/Re-188 generator was developed using this material from which >80% of Re-188 generated could be eluted with 0.9% saline solution, with high radionuclidic, radiochemical and chemical purity and appreciably high radioactive concentration suitable for radiopharmaceutical applications.

The applicability for the treatment of low-level liquid radioactive waste was investigated. The material was prepared by loading 4,4'(5')di-t-butylbenzo 18 crown 6 (DtBB18C6) onto poly(acrylamide-acrylic acid-acrylonitril)-N, N'-methylenediacrylamide (P(AM-AA-AN)-DAM). The removal of (134)Cs, (60)Co, (65)Zn, and ((152+154))Eu onto P(AM-AA-AN)-DAM/DtBB18C6 was investigated using a batch equilibrium technique with respect to the pH, contact time, and temperature. Kinetic models are used to determine the rate of sorption and to investigate the mechanism of sorption process. Five kinetics models, pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, intra-particle diffusion, homogeneous particle diffusion (HPDM), and Elovich models, were used to investigate the sorption process. The obtained results of kinetic models predicted that, pseudo-second-order is applicable: the sorption is controlled by particle diffusion mechanism and the process is chemisorption. The obtained values of thermodynamics parameters, Delta N degrees, Delta S degrees, and Delta G degrees indicated that the endothermic nature, increased randomness at the solid/solution interface and the spontaneous nature of the sorption processes.

Excitation functions of the Er-167(p,n)Tm-167 reaction and Er-168(p,n)Tm-168, Er-167(p,2n)Tm-166, Er-166(p,2n)Tm-166 disturbing reactions were measured up to 15 MeV by using the stacked foil irradiation technique and gamma-ray spectroscopy. The measured excitation functions agree well with the results of ALICE-IPPE, EMPIRE-II and TALYS nuclear reaction model codes. The thick target yield of Tm-167 in the 15-8 MeV energy range is 6.9 MBq/mu Ah. A short comparison of charged particle production routes of Tm-167 is given. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The C-14 radioactivity in the plant, mediums, and atmospheric carbon dioxide ((CO2)-C-14) in the chamber were determined, and the distribution of C-14 in the plant was visualized using autoradiography. In the double pot experiment, the shoot of the plant and the lower root which was soaked in the culture solution had C-14 radioactivity, but the upper root which did not have contact with the solution had none. There were also C-14 radioactivity in the grains and roots in the wet culture experiment. Results of the chamber experiment showed that (CO2)-C-14 gas was released from the culture solution in both types of cultures. Results indicated that the C-14-acetic acid absorbed by rice plant through its root would be very small. Most of the C-14-acetic acid was transformed into gaseous forms either in the culture solution or rhizosphere. A relatively longer time would be needed to assimilate C-14 derived from acetic acid to grain parts after it was once absorbed by the shoot through the root. Availability of C-14 for the plant in sand culture was considered to be decreased compared with that for the plant in the hydroponics experiment. It was suggested that rice plant absorbed and assimilated C-14 through the plant roots not because of uptake of C-14-acetic acid but because of uptake of C-14 in gaseous forms such as (CO2)-C-14.

The mixed-ligand Pt(II)([(125)I]Hist)(Carnosine) complex has been synthesized in a multi-step reaction. First, carnosine was modified by the attachment of SATA. After chromatographic purification, the conjugate was unprotected to form a reactive sulfhydryl functional group, and then the modified carnosine was substituted to PtCl(2)[(125)I]Hist complex. The Pt(II)(IT-[(125)I]Carnosine) and Pt(IV)(IT-[(131)I]Carnosine) complexes were synthesized in a three-step reaction. First, carnosine was labeled with iodine radionuclide ((125)I or (131)I), followed by conjugation with 2-IT. The modified IT-[*1]Carnosine was complexed with tetrachloroplatinate or hexachloroplatinate. Comparative biodistribution studies were performed in normal Wistar rats and in Lewis rats with implanted (s.c.) rat pancreatic tumor cells (AR42J). The HPLC analysis showed a relatively fast formation of the new mixed-ligand Pt([(125)I]Hist)(Carnosine) complex (yield ca. 50% after 20 h). Reaction of K2PtCl(4) with [(125)I]Carnosine modified by 2-IT proceeded rapidly and with a high yield ( >95% after 2 h). The synthesis of the Pt(IV)IT-[*I]Carnosine complex was the slower reaction in comparison to the analogous synthesis of the Pt(II) complex (yield ca. 70% after 12 h). thus a purification step was necessary. The biodistribution study proved the in vivo stability of the newly synthesized complexes (a low accumulation in thyroid gland and in GIT) and showed that the conjugation of the modified carnosine changes significantly biodistribution scheme of the Pt complexes comparing to the reference Pt(II)[*1]Hist and Pt(IV)([*I]Hist)(2) complexes. The mixed-ligand complex was rapidly excreted in urine and revealed the highest accumulation in kidneys (>5%ID/g). A very high concentration in blood and in liver was observed for the Pt(II)(IT-[(125)I]Carnosine) complex; however, at the same time the lowest concentration in kidneys was noted. Preliminary studies in the rat's tumor model indicated for this complex a favorable tumor to muscle ratio. In the case of Pt(IV)(IT-[*]Carnosine) apart from ca. 12-times decrease of the liver accumulation, additional 4-times decrease of an accumulation in kidneys was observed in comparison to the Pt(IV)([*I]Hist)(2) complex. Our study showed that the short peptides can be efficiently substituted to the platinum core via the reactive sulfhydryl group introduced by SATA or 2-IT. The new radioactive platinum complexes with carnosine possess favorable biodistribution schemes, which make them potential candidates for radio-chemotherapeutical agents. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Radiosynthesis of N-[C-11]-methyl-hydroxyfasudil as a new potential PET radiotracer for rho-kinases (ROCKs)	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Carbon-11; Fasudil; Hydroxyfasudil; Rho-kinases; Intracellular labeling	VASCULAR SMOOTH-MUSCLE; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION; PATHWAY; MICE	N-[C-11]-methyl-hydroxyfasudil was synthesized as a new potential radiotracer for rho-kinases (ROCKS) via a two-step one-pot radiosynthesis. The first step was the methylation of the precursor N-Boc-hydroxyfasudil-sodium salt/benzo-15-crown-5 complex with [C-11]methyl iodide. The second step involved deprotection of the tert-butoxycarbonyl protecting group. The radiochemical and chemical purities of N-[C-11]-methyl-hydroxyfasudil were >95% and specific radioactivity was 1565-2565 mCi/mu mol at the end of the synthesis. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Improving the sensitivity of radionuclide particulate monitoring stations	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Review						Radionuclide air-monitoring; Radionuclide station; Radon; CTBT; IMS		A worldwide radionuclide network of 80 stations, part of the International Monitoring System, is being setup to monitor compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). The radioactivity sampled at these stations is primarily (220)Rn progenies. Using the knowledge of the diurnal change of the (220)Rn progeny (212)Pb the sampled activity at the end of the sampling process can be minimised by choosing the right collection start time. It is shown that improvements of several percents in the minimum detectible concentration (MDC) for CTBT relevant nuclides can be achieved. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Artificial mixing of tap water with channeled spring water were found causing temperature decrease, lowering Ra(2+) concentration and inhibiting hokutolite crystallization. A novel mechanism was derived from this work to interpret the vanishment of hokutolite, which could also be applied in studying radiochemistry, migration of the radionuclides as well as the recovery and conservation of hokutolite.

J	Cho, YH; Moon, JH				Cho, Young Ho; Moon, Joo Hyun			Long-term plan for the development of the next generation nuclear energy systems in Korea	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article								In order to solve the problems associated with the accumulation of spent nuclear fuel and meet the future domestic energy demand, the Atomic Energy Commission, on December 22, 2008, developed "the long-term plan for the development of the next generation nuclear energy systems in Korea (LTP)." The paper briefly introduces the LTP through which the policy direction of the Korean government on the nuclear R&Ds may be speculated. The LTP is expected to play a variety of roles in nuclear energy fields. First, the LTP will form the basis of formulating other nuclear R&D plans. Second, the LTP can be used to check periodically the achievements of the relevant R&Ds. Third, the LTP could be used to draw up governmental budgets for the relevant R&Ds in each development phase. Finally, it may improve the national nuclear transparency by presenting transparent and consistent R&D activities.

J	Reisch, F				Reisch, Frigyes			High Pressure Boiling Water Reactor, HP-BWR	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article								Some 400 Boiling Water Reactors (BWR) and Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR) have been in operation for several decades. The presented concept, the High Pressure Boiling Water Reactor (HP-BWR) makes use of the operating experiences. HP-BWR combines the advantages and leaves out the disadvantages of the traditional BWRs and PWRs by taking in consideration the experiences gained during their operation. The best parts of the two traditional reactor types are used and the troublesome components are left out. HP-BWR major benefits are; 1. Safety is improved; -Gravity operated control rods -Large space for the cross formed control rods between fuel boxes -Bottom of the reactor vessel is smooth and is without penetrations -All the pipe connections to the reactor vessel are well above the top of the reactor core -Core spray is not needed -Internal circulation pumps are used 2. Environment friendly; -Improved thermal efficiency, feeding the turbine with similar to 340 degrees C (15 MPa) steam instead of similar to 285 degrees C (7MPa) -Less warm water release to the recipient and less uranium consumption per produced kWh and consequently less waste is produced 3. Cost effective, simple; -Direct cycle, no need for complicated steam generators -Moisture separators and steam dryers are inside the reactor vessel and additional separators and dryers can be installed inside or outside the containment Well proved simple dry containment or wet containment can be used.

J	Fukada, S; Terashita, M				Fukada, Satoshi; Terashita, Masashi			BEHAVIOR OF SEPARATIVE DESORPTION OF HYDROGEN, HELIUM, AND METHANE FROM CRYOSORPTION PUMP	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						tritium; cryosorption pump; fuel purification	VACUUM PUMPS; ITER; TRITIUM; DESIGN; PERFORMANCE; PANELS	The behavior of dynamic desorption of He, H(2), and CH(4) from a cryosorption pump is experimentally investigated using a simplified technique to roughly purify unburned D-T fuel exhausted from a fusion reactor. As a fundamental study to dynamically separate the unburned fuel and impurities, the discharge rates of H(2) (as a representative of D(2) and T(2)), He, and CH(4) (as major impurities ) are determined as a function of time or temperature, when the cryosorption pump is regenerated from similar to 10 K to the room temperature of 285 to 300 K according to the experimental date. It is found that H(2) is adsorbed and desorbed on active charcoal independent of the adsorption sites of He and CH(4), which are evacuated simultaneously. The present result leads to a simplified method for roughly separating unburned fuel from impurities in fusion reactors by controlling the desorption temperature.

J	Nishikawa, M				Nishikawa, Masabumi			STUDY ON TRITIUM BALANCE IN A D-T FUSION REACTOR	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						tritium balance; tritium burn efficiency; tritium loss	BLANKET	The tritium balance in a D-T fusion reactor is discussed in this paper comparing the amount of tritium consumed in the fueling cycle including the plasma vessel with the amount of tritium generated in the blanket system, using information reported so far. This comparison shows that the overall burning efficiency of tritium in the plasma vessel, the tritium loss ratio represented by tritium trapping in the redeposition layer of the plasma-facing material, and the recovery efficiency in the tritium breeding system play important roles in the tritium balance and that it may not be easy to maintain good tritium economy of a D-T fusion reactor if the proper combination of burning efficiency, tritium loss ratio, and tritium recovery efficiency is not obtained. The allowable limits for the overall tritium burning efficiency, for the tritium loss ratio in the fueling cycle, and for the recovery efficiency to secure the self-sustainable tritium system are also discussed in this paper.
