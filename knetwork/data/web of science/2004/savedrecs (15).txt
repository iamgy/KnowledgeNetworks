The data reveal that the plutonium is predominantly bound to geochemical phases targeted by the acido-soluble and the exchangeable extractants, indicating that a significant proportion of the plutonium in these and similar sediments is associated with relatively mobile geochemical phases. The results are consistent with the relatively high level of plutonium remobilisation now known to be taking place throughout the north-eastern Irish Sea. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The approach requires fitting a series of counting data acquired over a period of time to a triple exponential mathematical expression. The use and advantages of the method are illustrated for the case of the standardisation of P-32 in the presence of P-33 and S-35 by 4pi-beta liquid scintillation spectrometry. The effects of sample preparation, chemical quenching and different activity ratios were studied. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The NPL Secondary Standard Radionuclide Calibrator provides an alternative approach and a comparison was conducted with F-18 to investigate its feasibility. The exercise was successful and the paper details the protocol used, the quality assurance mechanisms introduced to underpin the comparison and an analysis of the results. It was also demonstrated that this approach could be linked to the BIPM SIR system. Recommendations are presented for the extension of this work to other suitable, short-lived radionuclides.

Whole body and skin dose rates arising from exposure to these foils during their periodic replacement have been estimated. The results indicate that irradiated foils do not represent a significant radiological hazard for the cyclotron operating staff and that no waste disposal difficulties should be encountered after an appropriate 'cooling' period of 2 years.

In the Arctic environment, the main source of plutonium is from the atmospheric weapons testing, but previous studies of plutonium in the Kara Sea have shown that, at certain sites, other releases can give rise to enhanced local concentrations. The present paper presents results from determination of plutonium concentrations and isotope ratios in the sediment samples collected during various expeditions to the Kara Sea, the Ob and Yenisey estuaries and their river systems. The data indicated a clear influence from a low Pu-240:Pu-239 source in surface sediments collected from the Yenisey estuary, whereas plutonium in Ob estuary sediments is dominated by global fallout. The results also show an increase in plutonium concentration (from 0.003 to 11 Bq/kg) and a decrease in Pu-240:Pu-239 isotope ratio (from 0.16 to 0.05) going upstream from the Yenisey estuary towards the nuclear installation at Krashnoyarsk.

The aim of this comparison was to test X- and gamma-ray spectrometry methods over a large range of isotopic ratios. These methods are based on the complex analysis of several X- and gamma-rays in the KX region of the plutonium spectrum and also in the 120-700 keV energy range. The results obtained by the participants with their corresponding uncertainties are presented in this document and compared to the declared values. The main conclusions of the work are also given. No important bias due to an inadequate knowledge of the nuclear data for plutonium isotopes was observed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Degtyarev, AM				Degtyarev, AM			Determination error of reactor subcriticality from sensor indications	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The simplest approximations (1D and 2D reactor, one-group diffusion model of neutron transport) are used to study the insensitivity, due to undetermined local perturbations of the multiplication power, of neutron flux sensor indications to reactor subcriticality. The analysis is based on the conservative assumption that such perturbations can combine with one another in an adverse manner. A ID model is used to establish the quantitative dependence of the error resulting from this phenomenon in the subcriticality recorded on a determining complex formed by the geometric characteristics and material parameter of the reactor. It is shown for a commercial uranium-graphite reactor that this error can be substantial in physically large reactors.

Calculations of the neutron and dynamical characteristics of these systems are performed. The information obtained, together with data from previous calculations, made it possible to draw a conclusion about the structure of reactor systems characterized by a short radiation pulse and large-volume cores and cavities for holding specimens. It is shown that a reactor with a single neptunium-gallium alloy core and a coupled cascade-type system consisting of this single driven reactor together with a driven subcritical uranium-graphite assembly have the best pulse parameters.

The most promising existing methods of solidification are low-temperature processes because they do not require complicated equipment and are cost-effective. As a result of the higher cost-effectiveness, less inert binder is needed in the overall volume of the solidified compound. Thus, using a complex phosphate, making it possible to increase the concentration of toxic products while maintaining reliable immobilization of the latter, is certainly a topical problem. Two advantages of phosphate ceramic are that high concentrations of anions which adversely affect the longevity of cement monoliths can be included and the spectrum of types of wastes chat can be handled, including sol residues of combustion and mercury-containing wastes, is wide.

No such coating work with ThF4 was carried out in the entire controlled area after 1998. Consequently, decommissioning of the controlled area and demolition of contaminated building structures and internals was planned. The demolition measures were organized in order to achieve clearance for unrestricted conventional use of the laboratory rooms. The activities which had to be conducted for decommissioning and demolition comprised - preparations for the permits to be secured, - packaging and disposal of plant waste, - demolition, and any necessary clearance measurements, - removal, - disposal of all demolitioning waste. The main objective of preparatory planning was to impair as little as possible the ongoing operation of the Laser Center. The application documents were drafted as planned, and demolition work at the Hanover Laser Center was carried out as scheduled. The measures implemented allowed the rooms to be released from the scope of the Atomic Energy Act.

J	Krass, G				Krass, G			Operators' responsibility for final storage	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th German Automic Energy Law Symposium	OCT   08, 2003	Cologne, GERMANY					The article contains an evaluation of the regulations about final storage as seen by the operators, especially with a view to their practical usefulness. Another point examined is the question whether there is really a need for reforms in atomic energy law. See. 9a, Para. I of the German Atomic Energy Act obliges nuclear power plant operators to either safely reuse any radioactive residues generated, or dispose of them as radioactive waste in a regulated fashion. The obligation of the federal government to build repositories under See. 9a, Para. 3, Atomic Energy Act is designed as a government duty. There is no need for amendments to the provisions about construction, operation, and financing of final storage. The set of legal tools in existence are sufficient. The operators have not doubt that safe final storage of all radioactive waste in Germany is achievable. In the current situation, therefore, - all measures should be taken which are necessary for a quick settlement of the administrative litigation over Konrad, and - the points still in doubt about Gorleben as mentioned in the agreement of June 14, 2000 should be settled as quickly as possible.

J	Zeng, Z; Natesan, K				Zeng, Z; Natesan, K			Fabrication of CaO insulator coatings by MOCVD for application in vanadium/lithium blankets	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						CaO; insulator coating; fusion; coolant blanket	ALLOYS	The blanket system is one of the most important components in a fusion reactor because it has a major impact on both the economics and safety of fusion energy. The primary functions of the blanket in a deuterium/tritium-fueled fusion reactor are to convert the fusion energy into sensible heat and to breed tritium for the fuel cycle. The self-cooled liquid metal blanket concept requires an electrically insulating coating on the first-wall structural material to minimize the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) pressure drop that occurs during the flow of liquid metal in a magnetic field. Calcium oxide is a possible coating material because it is an excellent electrical insulator and it has large negative free energy to prevent the attack from liquid lithium. In this paper, details are presented on the metallorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) method that was used to fabricate the CaO coating. The as-deposited CaO coating was annealed in calcium vapor to prevent coating spallation. Composition and phase analyses of the coating were performed by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the coating did not crack after several thermal cycles from room temperature to 715 degreesC. The resistance of the coating was high enough for application as an insulating coating for the self-cooled lithium blanket in fusion systems. The information on Li compatibility is only preliminary and additional effort is needed to evaluate their long-term performance in fusion-relevant conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Release rates of hydrogen isotopes (tritium and deuterium) as well as hydrocarbons from the JT-60U vacuum vessel induced by glow discharge cleaning (GDC) with He and H-2 were measured. Release characteristics of hydrogen isotopes could be classified into three release processes, and each process was well described by a simple exponential decrease with time. It was found that H, GDC showed the superior hydrogen isotope release characteristics to the He GDC, probably because of chemical processes, such as isotope exchanges assisted by the chemical sputtering process between discharged hydrogen and hydrogen isotopes in the plasma facing carbon tiles were enhanced by the H-2 glow discharge. Based on the release kinetics observed in the present work, it is estimated that it takes several days to reduce tritium (deuterium) inventory within the removal depth by the H-2 GDC in JT-60U to a half by continuous H-2 GDC at 573 K.

Dose determination was performed using a specially developed automatic spectrum processing procedure. Spectrum processing was carried out in different operating modes, and average results were taken in order to reduce the contribution of uncertainty in dose determination caused by spectrum processing. The absorbed doses determined in enamel were corrected to take into account the contribution of natural background radiation and to determine the individual excess dose due to radioactive contamination of the territory. Individual excess doses are compared to calculated individualized doses to teeth, estimated using the local radioactive contamination levels, dose rates, and information concerning individual behavior. The individual excess doses measured by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and the calculated individualized doses are fully independent. Mean square variation between results of two methods was found to be 34 mGy, which is consistent with error estimation for both methods. This result can validate both the methodology of signal processing presented here when using electron paramagnetic resonance dosimetry of tooth enamel for low doses and the methodology of individualized dose calculation.

Dose was evaluated for three metal tritides: hafnium, titanium, and zirconium. The study included in vitro and in vivo exposures. The inhalation doses for the three materials were calculated by using the ICRP 66 lung model. The doses also were evaluated by a biokinetic model, which was developed according to the results of animal studies. Results showed that the hafnium tritide particles were the most dense but they had a lower dissolution rate and a higher retention rate. Among these three tritides, hafnium was classified as a Type S material according to the ICRP 66 publication, whereas titanium and zirconium ranked between Type M and F materials. The dissolution rate of hafnium tritide appeared to agree well with the in vitro and in vivo studies. The dissolution rates of the other two materials in the in vitro studies were a little higher than those of the in vivo studies. The doses calculated by the ICRP 66 model for all materials were approximately two orders smaller than the doses obtained by the animal studies. This bias was caused by the different intake methods of the ICRP 66 model (inhalation) and in the animal study (instillation). The doses were on the same order while correcting for deposition fractions. The effective doses for hafnium, titanium, and zirconium tritides were 5.43 x 10(-10), 9.05 x 10(-11), and 6.5 x 10(-10) Sv Bq(-1), respectively, according to the animal studies.

J	DeVol, TA; Powell, BA				DeVol, TA; Powell, BA			Theoretical organically bound tritium dose estimates	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						tritium; ingestion; dose, internal; biokinetics	TRITIATED-WATER; PLANTS; ENVIRONMENT	This paper illustrates a theoretical approach to estimating the dose associated with the ingestion of both organically bound tritium and tissue free water tritium relative to the ingestion of only tissue free water tritium. Organically bound tritium, specifically non-exchangeable OBT, can result in an increased dose relative to that from exchangeable organically bound tritium and tissue free water tritium because of the longer biological half-life of the former resulting in a dose conversion factor that is twice that of the latter. Non-exchangeable organically bound tritium is tritium that is bound to carbon whereas exchangeable organically bound tritium is tritium bound to oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. Tissue free water ranges from 85+% in most fruits and vegetables down to approximately 10% in grains. The remaining edible food mass consists, in part, of exchangeable and nonexchangeable hydrogen that is incorporated into carbohydrates, proteins and fat. The potential organically bound tritium content of several common food items was calculated knowing the amount of bound and unbound hydrogen that exists in these foods and by assuming that the hydrogen to tritium ratio is the same for the "free water" and bound hydrogen compartments. The theoretical ratio of dose from ingestion of organically bound tritium and tissue free water tritium to dose from ingestion of only tissue free water tritium was calculated to be on average within 12%, 30%, and 261% of experimentally based values for fruits and vegetables, meats and eggs, and grains, respectively. The difference is attributed to the T:H ratio being a function of the kinetics associated with the assimilation of tritium into the tissues.

The committed radiation dose is significantly dependent on the fraction of the ingested activity that crossed the gut wall (f(1) value). In tracer kinetic investigations, the effect of sodium alginate on the gastrointestinal absorption of strontium was studied in human subjects. Sodium alginate was proven to be a potent agent for reducing strontium absorption with high efficiency and virtually no toxicity. The data obtained show that the uptake of ingested strontium from milk was reduced by a factor of nine when alginate was added to milk. It is concluded that alginate preparations are a suitable antidote against radiostrontium.

The radioactivity was primarily on the front face of the cathode ray tube and was not amenable to decontamination. Hot spots were found also along the edges and seals of the cathode ray tube. Similar surveys of computer monitors that were never in Contamination Areas confirmed that radioactivity was incorporated into the monitor. Surveys were made of recently manufactured television sets with similar results. Gamma spectroscopy indicates that tire radioactivity is due to naturally occurring radioactive materials. Since most surveys of cathode ray tubes in the literature were made while the units were energized and indicated low-energy x-rays, the use of naturally occurring radioactive materials in the manufacture of cathode ray tubes has not been widely recognized. This paper presents the results of these surveys, the results of gamma spectroscopy, and a method for releasing existing computer equipment having naturally occurring radioactive materials.

HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topic; Eu-152; phantom; lungs, human		The use of a lung phantom containing Eu-152/Am-241 activity can provide a sufficient number of energy lines to generate an efficiency calibration for the in vivo measurements of radioactive materials in the lungs. However, due to the number of energy lines associated with Eu-152, coincidence summing occurs and can present a problem when using such a phantom for calibrating lung-counting systems. A Summing Peak Effect Study was conducted at three laboratories to determine the effect or using an efficiency calibration based on a Eu-152/Am-241 lung phantom. The measurement data at all three laboratories showed the presence of sum peaks. While one of the laboratories found only small biases (<5%) when using the Eu-152/Am-241 calibration, the other facilities noted up to 30% positive bias in the 140 keV to 190 keV energy range that prevents the use of the Eu-152/Am-241 lung phantom for routine calibrations. Although manufactured by different vendors, the three facilities use similar types of germanium detectors (38 cm(2) by 25 mm thick or 38 cm(2) by 30 mm thick) for counting. These results underscore the need to evaluate the coincidence summing effect, which appear system dependent, when using a nuclide such as Eu-152 for the calibration of low-energy lung counting systems and highlight the problem of using a general calibration curve in place of specific nuclide calibration factors.

An unusual incident occurred in late January 2002 at our institution when a Na-22 sealed source was breached, and a small portion of the contents accidentally migrated to various locations in the very large laboratory. Damage control provided a challenge to radiation safety personnel. Resources of the Radiation Safety Office were severely taxed during both the immediate reaction and the subsequent several months of decontamination prior to release of the laboratory for unrestricted use of radioactive materials once again. Salient features of this incident are described in conjunction with a portrayal of measures taken during early damage control and the following deliberate remediation.

Estimates were performed by hand calculations and using RESRAD and MAXDOSE-SR. Doses were estimated for the following pathways: (1) shine and inhalation as a result of standing on contaminated soil at the H Area Retention Basin and the Old Radioactive Waste Burial Ground; (2) exposure to off-unit receptors due to soil disturbances from excavation type activities at the H Area Retention Basin and the Old Radioactive Waste Burial Ground; (3) exposure to off-unit receptors due to soil disturbances from dumping or soil from bucket and from roll-off pan; and (4) exposure to off-unit receptors from wind driven dust from contaminated area. The highest dose estimates (0.25 mSv h(-1)) resulted from the receptor standing on the H Area Retention Basin.

J	Stencel, JR; Lee, KY				Stencel, JR; Lee, KY			The voluntary siting process, a case study in New Jersey	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topic; waste management; waste disposal; radiation, low-level		The Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980 and its 1985 Amendments has not provided new disposal capacity within the United States; however, sufficient disposal capacity currently exists to handle today's disposal needs. Politics, opposition groups, and public mistrust in government have combined to limit the possibilities for establishing new disposal facilities. In 2000, New Jersey (NJ) and Connecticut (CT), as members of the Northeast Compact for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste, admitted South Carolina (SC) to their compact, renaming it as the "Atlantic Compact." The advantage to SC is that they are able to prevent disposal of waste from outside the Compact. The advantage to NJ and CT is that they are guaranteed waste disposal for approximately the next 50 years, or until all currently operating nuclear power plants in the states are decommissioned. This paper details the process, much or it not following the scientific method, to try to site a low-level waste facility in NJ. With the formation or the NJ Siting Board in 1987, an effort was made to locate a site using deterministic criteria; however, in 1992, the Board shifted to a voluntary process. In 1998, the Board made the determination that there was adequate capacity for waste disposal and ended active siting. In 2000, the opportunity to form the Atlantic Compact ended siting through an out-of-state solution. While it is not clear that the voluntary process would have ultimately worked in NJ, it has worked in Canada and the process may be one of the few mechanisms for the siting of any type of hazardous material disposal facility. Also, other states still have to decide what they will do after 2008 when Barnwell is no longer open to them.

J	Bruyant, PP; Gifford, HC; Gindi, G; King, MA				Bruyant, PP; Gifford, HC; Gindi, G; King, MA			Numerical observer study of MAP-OSEM regularization methods with anatomical priors for lesion detection in Ga-67 images	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						anatomical priors; Gallium-67; iterative methods; numerical observer; tomography; tumor detection	EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; BAYESIAN RECONSTRUCTION; CARDIAC SPECT; INFORMATION; OPTIMIZATION; SIMULATION; ALGORITHM; PET	With the increasing number of multimodality systems, registered anatomical data is becoming available for use as patient-specific attenuation maps and anatomical priors in iterative reconstruction. The goal of this work is to investigate whether the introduction of anatomical information in MAP-EM reconstruction can improve lesion detection in Ga-67 images of the chest region. Specifically we investigated three hypotheses. The first hypothesis was that use of information on organ boundaries in MAP-EM will increase the accuracy of tumor detection. The second hypothesis was that use of lesion boundaries in addition to organ boundaries will increase the detection accuracy of lesions when the lesion actually has an elevated concentration of activity compared to background. The third hypothesis was that use of the organ boundary prior in MAP-EM results in improved lesion detection accuracy for lesions with an elevated activity concentration even when the lesion boundary prior was also used for sites where there was not an elevated activity concentration. These hypotheses were investigated using Monte Carlo simulated projections of the mathematical cardiac-torso (MCAT) phantom. The organ and lesion boundaries for use as anatomical priors were obtained from segmentation of the original MCAT activity slices. The priors were used to determine voxel inclusion in the neighborhood of a voxel for a quadratic smoothing prior employed in De Pierro's MAP-OSEM reconstruction algorithm. Two contrasts for lesion/background were investigated, 12/1, and 22.5/1. Three values for beta, the parameter controlling the weighting of the prior, were also investigated. A numerical observer was used to determine the average lesion detection accuracy for multiple sites throughout the mediastinum. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the numerical observer was used as the metric for detection accuracy. No evidence was observed in support of the first hypothesis. That is, use of the anatomical prior including just organ boundaries did not tend to increase the AUC over that of not using priors. Evidence was found in support of the second hypothesis however. That is, especially for the lower contrast lesions, the AUC increased, when the lesion boundary was included in the prior. Finally, evidence was also observed in support of the third hypothesis. That is, again especially at the lower. contrast, the use of the anatomical prior increased detection accuracy for lesions with increased uptake even when the prior was also used for matching sites with no elevation in uptake. Thus, use of the anatomical prior for lesion boundary when there was no. elevated lesion uptake did not tend to increase the false-positive rate as one might have guessed would happen.

Various combinations of attenuation, detector response and scatter compensation were used in this study. A major difference between this and previous studies was that the level of realism was significantly increased by inclusion of variability in Mart and organ uptakes, in the. heart size and orientation, and in the defect size and contrast. In this study we used a population of 24 4-D NCAT phantoms [11 (half male, half female) recently developed with statistical models for organ uptake and organ size based on clinical data. Almost noise-free projection data of the torso, heart, liver, lungs, and other organs were simulated for each phantom using the SIMSET MC simulation code. They were then combined to form 72 sets of projections for each phantom using randomly sampled activity ratios from a clinically realistic distribution. Poisson noise was then added to the projection data. We applied the channelized hotelling observer (CHO) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to optimize iteration number for OSEM and cutoff frequency of a 3-D post-reconstruction Butterworth filter. We found that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) values were reduced compared to a previous study that included significantly less phantom variability, even though the defect contrast was higher and noise level was lower. The resulting AUC values were similar to those obtained using patient data. We found, in agreement with the previous study, that including compensation for more effects resulted in improved defect detectability. However, the optimal filter cutoff frequency was increased compared to the previous study. These studies demonstrate the importance of including realistic levels of phantom variability in myocardial perfusion studies using simulated data.

Materials and methods: Peripheral lymphocytes from 66 WUM and 29 RGM were cultured and analysed for structural chromosomal aberrations in Giemsa-stained M1 metaphases. Cytogenctic data from 23 male white-collar workers from public services were used as a historical control group. Results : The frequencies of chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges in WUM and RCM were quite similar. Compared with public services workers, WUM and RCM had significantly higher frequencies of chromosomal aberrations. Conclusions: Chromosomal aberrations in WUM are not induced by radioactive particles inhaled during underground mining but as in RCM rather result from factors such as age, lifestyle, illnesses, medications and diagnostic irradiations.

Gas release was measured on line with a great accuracy. In the examined materials helium was created by alpha-decay of plutonium or laboratory infused at high temperature and high pressure. The selected samples exhibited different types of lattice damage, including reactor burn-up and high alpha-radiation doses. Analysis of helium release as a function of temperature enabled the elementary diffusion processes to be investigated and the atomic diffusion coefficient to be deduced for a defined state of helium-in-solid. The helium diffusion coefficient has the expression: D = 8 x 10(-7) exp (-46 kcal mol(-1) /RT) m(2)s(-1), however, the enthalpy of diffusion increases to 70 kcal mol(-1) in high burn-up fuel where helium is apparently stabilised in uranium/oxygen vacancy clusters.

As a result, it was shown that there is a threshold in the U/Pu ratio in the salt phase between 1/4.3 and 1/1.73 for the successful simultaneous recovery of uranium and plutonium up to 10 wt% in the LCC at high current efficiencies. In the LCC, uranium and, plutonium existed in the forms of intermetallic compounds, (U, Pu)Cd-6 and (U, Pu)Cd-11, and also pure uranium metal. It was also revealed that americium associates with plutonium according to the separation factor during the LCC operation. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	White, RJ				White, RJ			The development of grain-face porosity in irradiated oxide fuel	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							FISSION-GAS RELEASE; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; SURFACE DIFFUSION; ENERGY	The predominant mode of fission gas release occurs through atomic diffusion to the grain boundaries. In oxide fuels the fission gases initially precipitate as an array of small lenticular bubbles of circular projection. The arrival of additional gas and vacancies causes these bubbles to grow and coalesce into fewer, larger bubbles. Depending on the irradiation conditions and temperatures, these bubbles may develop either as circular lenticular pores or as extended multi-lobed pores. Eventually the pores may intersect the grain edges where pathways may be formed which enable the gas to migrate to the outer geometry of the fuel and hence to the gap and the pin free volume. Recent extensive PIE campaigns on irradiated fuels have provided a large database of inter-granular porosity development and, from these, models of bubble growth, coalescence, morphological relaxation and venting have been developed.

The molar heat capacities of U1-yGdyO2 (0<y<0.27) were close to, or slightly lower than, the values calculated by using the summation rule, and anomalous increases of heat capacities were not clearly observed at temperatures above 1,000 K. The heat capacity analysis for (U, Gd)O-2 showed that the excess heat capacities of (U, Gd)O-2 tended to decrease with increasing cation concentration excluding U4+ ions in crystals. This suggested that the Schottky term contribution to the heat capacity, which was mainly caused by the excitation of f electrons in the 5f(2) configuration in U4+ ions, decreased in (U, Gd)O-2, compared to that in undoped UO2 due to the formation of U5+ and Gd3+ ions in (U, Gd)O-2 by addition of Gd2O3. Thermal functions of (U, Gd)O-2 were also evaluated.

The applicability of proposed equation was examined using LWR spent fuel dissolution test results in the present study as well as the results obtained by other workers.

The model includes the film mass transfer of fluorine gas and its diffusion in the particle. The rate constants of the model are determined by fitting the experimental data for 370-450degreesC. The model successfully represents the fluorination in this temperature range. The rate control step is identified by examining the rate constants of the model for 300-1,800degreesC. For temperature range up to 900degreesC, the fluorination reaction is rate controlling. For over 900degreesC, both mechanisms of the mass transfer of fluorine and the fluorination reaction control the rate of the fluorination. With further increase of the temperature, however, the fluorination reaction becomes so fast that the mass transfer of fluorine eventually controls the rate of the fluorination.

J	Sasaki, T; Gunji, Y; Okuda, T				Sasaki, T; Gunji, Y; Okuda, T			Mathematical modeling of radon emanation	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						radon; emanation coefficient; uranium ore; uranium-beating waste; NORM; radon recoil; moisture effect on radon emanation; moisture saturation; close-packed spherical grain model		It is well known that radon emanation is affected by moisture. The models which explain radon emanation can be considered to come in three types. One is to predict the maximum possibility of radon emanation assuming uniform distribution of radium in a solid grain independent of moisture. The other two are to explain moisture effect on radon emanation, but their aims are different from each other. The first of them aims to demonstrate a theory explaining microscopic phenomena of radon emanation employing observed macroscopic phenomena of radon emanation under moist condition. The second aims to predict the leveling-off value of radon emanation under moist conditions employing an observed data of radon emanation under dry condition. The present paper develops a close-packed spherical grain model which belongs to the last type of model just mentioned. This model is oriented to contribute to the safety assessment of uranium-bearing waste disposal. Uranium-bearing waste generates radon as one of the uranium decay chain daughter nuclides. They will build up until about 200,000 years after disposal. At that far future, rainwater may well come into contact with the disposed waste and increase radon emanation. Therefore, leveling-off radon emanation has to be employed for the safety assessment. The model by the present paper is best oriented for this purpose.

The k-inf change caused by the difference in cross section sets between JENDL-3.2 and JENDL-3.3 was investigated for some UO2 and MOX cells. The k-inf change is -0.50 to -0.74%Deltak/k for the UO2 cells and -0.04 to +0.02%Deltak/k for the MOX cells. In the UO2 cells, the difference in U-235 capture cross section causes the change of -0.36 to -0.70%Deltak/k mainly in the resonance energy range, and 235U fission cross section causes the change of -0.22 to -0.16%Deltak/k mainly in the thermal energy range. The difference in U-238 capture cross section causes a change of about -0.05%Deltak/k mainly in the energy range above 1 MeV. In the MOX cells, a small k-inf change results from the cancellation of relatively large contributions of capture reactions of Pu-240 and Am-241. The capture reaction of Pu-240 has a k-inf contribution of +0.10 to +0.30%Deltak/k mainly in the resonance energy range. This is offset by the capture reaction of Am-241 which has a contribution of -0.13 to -0.22% Deltak/k primarily at the resonance peak near 0.6 eV.

As a result, one could obtain the same formulation of the flux tilt in one-energy-group model based on a conventional higher-order perturbation theory with one-energy-group approximation. To show the validity of this relationship, flux tilt experiments were carried out by using a coupled-core at the Kyoto University Critical Assembly, and analyses of the experiments were performed for inferring the first-mode eigenvalue separation from both the perturbed reactivity and the degree of flux tilt induced by a perturbation. Through the comparison between the analyses and the experiments, the validity of the relationship derived was demonstrated, and it was concluded that the flux tilt is independent of the neutron energy.

A small water leak can cause a plasma disruption although there is another possibility to terminate plasma without disruption. This plasma disruption will induce electromagnetic (EM) forces acting in the vacuum vessel (VV). From a radiological safety viewpoint, the VV is designed to form a physical barrier that encloses tritium and activated dust. If the VV can sustain an unstable fracture by EM forces from a through crack to cause the small leak, the structural safety will be assured and the inherent safety will be demonstrated. Therefore, a systematic approach to assure the structural safety is developed. A new analytical model to evaluate the through crack and leak rate of cooling water is proposed, with verification by experimental leak measurements. Based on the analysis, the critical crack length to terminate plasma is evaluated as about 2 mm. On the other hand, the critical crack length for unstable fracture is obtained as about 400 mm. It is concluded that EM forces induced by the small leak to terminate plasma will not cause unstable fracture of the VV; thus the inherent safety is demonstrated.

Placing this target into sub-critical nuclear fission assemblies is yielding substantial fission reactions, thus additional fission energy (Rubbia called such a system "Energy Amplifier"). This technology has recently attracted considerable attention due to advances in the construction of powerful accelerators. It allows the safe and cheap production of nuclear energy simultaneously with the destruction (Transmutation) of long lived radioactive waste, in particular plutonium and other minor actinides (neptunium and americium). The principles and the present-state-of-the-art are described, including first experiments to transmute plutonium this way. This technology needs, however, many more years of further "research and development" before large scale ADS's can be constructed. It may be even necessary to investigate the question, if all basic physics phenomena of this technology are already sufficiently well understood.

This device is based on the detection of secondary electron emitted by a thin foil placed at 45degrees to the direction of the beam. Secondary electrons are accelerated and focused by an electric and a magnetic field toward a low-pressure gaseous chamber. Time and position (X and Y) are measured. The typical resolutions (FWHM) are 300 ps and 1.5 mm, respectively. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
