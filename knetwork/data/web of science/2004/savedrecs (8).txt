Among the detected nuclides we identified the spallation and fission products. High-spin isomeric states in the Hf and Lu nuclides were populated and the isomer-to-ground state ratios could be estimated. The nuclide yields were calculated using the LAHET code at six different values of the proton energy in the range from 100 to 800 MeV both for the W-nat and enriched 186W targets. The measured isotope yields are in general good agreement with the calculations. A shortcoming of the code is the inability to predict isomer-to-ground state ratios. The experimental data show that the Lu-177m, Hf-178m2 and Hf-179m2 high-spin isomers are produced with a 2.5 times higher yield in the 97% enriched W-186 target as compared to the W-nat target under identical irradiation conditions. This makes significance for the creation of high-activity isomeric sources. The mass-distribution of the products and the fission-to-spallation ratio were also deduced and compared with theory prediction. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two NaI(TI) detectors were positioned at the opposite sides of the sample, and mathematical correlations of the count rates were used to develop an algorithm, which gave quantities independent on the source location. The mathematical algorithm was validated by experimental results. This method reduces to a great extent the uncertainty of the activity determination. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

(1) a beta imager was derived from research conducted by Pr Charpak at CERN. This parallel plate avalanche chamber is a direct detection system of beta radioactivity, which is particularly adapted for qualitative and quantitative autoradiography. With this detector, autoradiographic techniques can be performed with emitters Such as Tc-99m because this radionuclide emits many low-energy electrons and the detector has a very low sensitivity to low-range gamma-rays. Its sensitivity (smallest activity detected: 0.007 cpm/mm(2) for H-3 and 0.01 for C-14): linearity (over a dynamic range of 104) and spatial resolution (50 mum for 3 H or Tc-99m to 150 put for P-32 or F-18 (beta(+))) gives a real interest to this system as a new imaging device. Its principle of detection is based on the analysis of light emitted during the interaction with an intensified CCD camera. This property may suggest new potential applications, particularly in the field of beta-rays selection according to their energy. This detector provides a new fast way to detect all beta-emitting isotopes in biological samples up to 20 cm x 25 cm (electrophoresis gels, hybridization membranes, tissue sections on glass slides, TLC plates and any other planar two-dimension samples). It is ideal for tritium detection. 500 times faster than classical film, thus maximizing the research productivity. (2) A micro imager is based on contact imaging through a solid scintillator sheet. Light emitted is amplified through an image intensifier tube and is analyzed with a CCD camera. The full field of view is smaller than the first one (24 mm x 32 mm) but a better spatial resolution is obtained (typically 15 mum for H-3, 20 mum for C-14 and S-35). The specifications of this detector are: efficiency 50-100% depending on isotope, linear response over a dynamic range of 104, smallest activity detected: 0.4cpm/mm(2) for H-3 and 0.04cpm/mm(2) for C-14. Using these detectors, quantification is much easier and more precise than that of the radiological film because of direct counting of radioactivity. However, this quantification imposes a few limitations among which are the necessity of fabrication and simultaneous measurement of standards. With new developments of these devices it is possible to detect in the same sample two different isotopes : H-3 and C-14 for example, which is very attractive to many researchers today.

Here, we present a novel and sensitive addition to the microarray armamentarium. Critical factors affecting the detection of target hybridization on microarrays include the design of capture probes, the way they are attached to the support, incorporation efficiency of labeled nucleotides into target RNA, and the sensitivity of the detection method. Microarray analysis is commonly based on detection of fluorescence signals through a confocal laser scanner. However, with human or other tissues that may not be readily available, sensitive radioactive hybridization techniques offer attractive opportunities, reducing the need for target or signal amplification. We have developed a new instrument with a double-sided silicon strip detector, for reading microarray slides labeled with isotopes. In this current work, we present data demonstrating that the resolution, sensitivity levels, dynamic range and linearity of this isotope-based detection system makes it an attractive supplement to fluorescence-based scanners. In model experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness of isotopic detection for several high-throughput applications in biology. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to compare SHC with a new highly resolutive multi-hole collimator (MHC) in situations simulating the in vivo detection of two radioactive sources. Materials and Methods: The probe was composed of a SHC or a MHC, a CsI(Tl) crystal, a photomultiplier tube and a count rate unit. Sensitivity response curves were experimentally obtained with a Co-57 source. From these values, the response curve in front of two small sources was simulated with an Excel software. A 30 MBq source (A) was placed at 1 cm depth and a 300 kBq source (B) was placed, successively, at 1, 3 and 5 cm. B was then moved towards A by 1 mm steps. A threshold background/signal of 50% was used to determine the minimal distance between the sources (D-min) to remain separately detectable. Results: At 1, 3 and 5 cm depths D-min wash respectively, 35, 45 and 53 mm for SHC and 14, 17 and 20 mm for MHC and the count rate in front of B was, respectively, 3060, 480 and 210 cps with the SHC and 900, 360 and 150 cps with the MHC. Conclusion: When compared with SHC, the loss in sensitivity with the MHC is only moderate for long source-probe distances while the gain in resolution remains important at any distance. MHC is an interesting option for peroperative detection. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The original concept is based on the association of a large field of view scintillator optically coupled with an array of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), in order to locate the position of interactions inside the crystal. Using a dedicated accessory, like a parallel hole collimator, to focus the field of view toward a predefined direction, it is possible to built up an image of the radioactive distribution. In terms of imaging performances, three main characteristics are commonly considered: uniformity, spatial resolution and energy resolution. Major improvements were mainly due to progress in terms of industrial process regarding analogical electronic, crystal growing or PMTs manufacturing. Today's gamma camera is highly digital, from the PMTs to the display. All the corrections are applied "on the fly" using up to date signal processing techniques. At the same time some significant progresses have been achieved in the field of collimators. Finally, two new technologies have been implemented, solid detectors like CdTe or CdZnTe, and pixellized scintillators plus photodiodes or position sensitive photomultiplier tubes.

A radiotracer is injected preoperatively in the tumor. The surgeon can locate the lesion with a gamma probe. It has been recommended that the tissue is resected where the activity falls rapidly. But this cut-off level can fluctuate depending on the user. The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of two different types of collimation. Materials and methods: To simulate the detection of a radioactive "lesion", 0.2 ml of a solution of 99mTc labeled colloids (4 MBq) were deposited at 3 cm depth in a chunk of cow muscle. Detection was performed with a gamma probe (GammaSup, Clerad, F) equipped either with a regular or with an additional high-resolution collimator. The response curve was drawn moving laterally the probe on the chunk of cow by 5 mm steps. Edges of resection were determined with different cut-off levels (from 5 to 50% of maximum counts by 5% steps). Results: Without additional collimator, the mean distance between injection point and resection edge was 18 mm, standard deviation 7.8mm with a range between 11 and 18mm. With additional collimator, the mean distance decreased to 10mm (-44%), standard deviation 4.2mm (-46%) with a range between 6 and 10mm. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that the additional collimator provides more precise and reproductive delineation of the injection site. It should be optimal for the ROLL technique.

J	Maeda, S; Sekine, T; Aoyama, T				Maeda, S; Sekine, T; Aoyama, T			Measurement and analysis of decay heat of fast reactor spent MOX fuel	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								Decay heat measurements have been conducted in the experimental fast reactor JOYO to accumulate experimental data and verify the analysis method. We developed the measurement system based on the calorimetric method as a non-destructive examination. The calibration for heat measurement considering heat balance and the correction for heat loss due to radiation penetration were evaluated. Using this system, the decay heat of the spent MOX fuels, with burn-ups of approximately 66 GWd/t and cooling times of between 40 and 729 days, was measured in the JOYO spent fuel storage pond. An appropriate coolant flow rate has allowed us to measure decay heat between 150 W and 2000 W with an error of 1.7-6.0%. The decay heat was calculated using the ORIGEN2 code with the JENDL-3.2 cross section library and the JNDC-V2 decay data and fission yield data library. The irradiation condition used as an input to ORIGEN2 was calculated using the JOYO core management code system. The ratios between the calculated and experimental values were between 0.96 and 0.90. A systematic discrepancy was observed between the calculated and measured values, which was larger than the experimental error. The discrepancy appears due to the production and transmutation calculation uncertainty of minor actinides and long-lived fission products. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

EOS for nuclear fuel materials such as oxides, nitrides, carbides, metal alloy and also for graphite-a moderator, are obtained based on principle of corresponding states (PCs). The total vapour pressures over the liquid region, calculated by the PCs method, are compared with experimental data obtained using an in-house developed laser-induced vaporization mass spectrometric facility for UO2, UC, ThO2 and graphite and are found to be in good agreement. Vapour pressure of PuN is the highest and that of UC is the lowest for the range of temperatures involved in the event of a core disruptive accident. The vapour pressure of the mixed carbide fuel is very close to that of the alloy fuel. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Bokhari, IH				Bokhari, IH			Steady-state thermal hydraulic and safety analyses of a proposed mixed fuel (HEU&LEU) core for Pakistan research reactor-1	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								Pakistan Research Reactor (PARR-1) was converted from Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) to Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) fuel, in 1992. The reactor is running successfully with an upgraded power level of 10 MW. In order to save money on the purchase of costly fresh LEU fuel elements, it is being thought to use some of the less burnt HEU spent fuel elements along with the present LEU fuel elements. In the present study steady-state thermal hydraulics of a proposed mixed fuel core (see Fig. 2) has been carried out. Results show that the proposed core, comprising of 24 LEU and 5 HEU standard fuel elements, with 4 LEU and one HEU control fuel elements, can be safely operated at a power level of 9.86 MW without compromising on safety. Standard computer codes and correlations were employed to compute various parameters, which include: coolant velocity distribution in the core; critical velocity; pressure drop; saturation temperature; temperature distribution in the core and margins to Onset of Nucleate Boiling (ONB), Onset of Flow Instability (OFI) and Departure from Nucleate Boiling (DNB).

J	Tang, SS; Hussein, EMA				Tang, SS; Hussein, EMA			Use of isotopic gamma sources for identifying anti-personnel landmines	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						landmines; compton scattering; isotopic sources; gamma radiation; one-side inspection		Density is one of the indicators that can be utilized to distinguish an explosive material from an innocuous anomaly. Compton scattering of photons can be used to provide such density indication. Although X-rays have been employed for this purpose, isotopic gamma-rays offer some advantage for use in a portable device, because of their small size and self-powered nature. Radioisotopes were considered in the 1970's by the US Army. This work re-examines the utility of these sources for the detection of shallowly buried anti-personnel landmines. Monte Carlo studies indicated that the most effective configuration for identifying and locating a buried landmine should employ a collimated Am-241 source, along with a set of well-collimated detectors. Experimental measurements verified the feasibility of the proposed method and demonstrated the detectablility of mockups of landmines as small as 45 mm in diameter buried near the soil surface, or mockups larger than 80 mm in diameter buried at a depth of 80 mm, in light soil. In heavy soil, targets 80 mm in diameter were detectable at a depth of 30 turn. The use of the low-energy (60 keV) Am-241 source makes it possible to design a light-weight hand-held device that can augment other methods of detecting plastic landmines. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

An anionite saturated in the initial solution or pulp is treated with a solution of an alkaline agent, to which an alkaline-metal salt is added, and is presaturated with uranium in a period of 2-5 h in contact with a commercial-grade desorbate. This scheme makes it possible to intensify sorption extraction by decreasing the presaturation time, decrease the consumption of reagents and sorbent by increasing the uranium sorption capacity and selectivity, increase the quality of the finished product, and prevent impurity metals from poisoning the ionite.

J	Hohlefelder, W				Hohlefelder, W			2004 Meeting on nuclear technology: Opening address	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Editorial Material								The public debate about the peaceful use of nuclear power has subsided thanks to the agreement reached between the electricity utilities and the German Federal Government. This agreement, and its supervision by the Monitoring Group, have proved to work so far. The federal government's commitment to implementing the agreement must be stressed. By and large, the operation of nuclear power plants is free from political disturbance. This applies in particular to ensuring the management of spent fuel elements in nuclear power plants. There is no longer any need to be concerned about nuclear power plants being clogged up with spent fuel element not removed. The complete change of course in the final storage of radioactive waste as planned by Federal Minister for the Environment Jurgen Trittin must be rejected. Under this new concept, there would be only one repository for all types of radioactive waste, and the site selection procedure would be started all over again; in addition, it foresees transfer of the duty to establish a repository from the federal government to an association which the operators of nuclear power plants would be compelled to join. Instead, implementation of the licensed Konrad repository project must be started as soon as possible, and exploration of the Gorleben salt dome must be continued. The plans of the Federal Ministry for the Environment are neither justified in fact nor responsible from the points of view of the economy and waste management policy. The nuclear option should be kept open also in Germany, also in the light of international developments, for instance, with plants being licensed to operate for up to sixty years, and in view of the positive perspectives of nuclear power in neighbouring countries. The questions of climate protection and of the power plants to be built in Germany by 2020, by which date approximately 40,000 MW of generating capacity will have been lost, require appropriate responses and solutions.

J	Sander, HH				Sander, HH			Final storage of radioactive waste in Germany: Overall government responsibility for the future	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting on Nuclear Technology	MAY 25-27, 2004	Dusseldorf, GERMANY	Deutsch Atomforum eV, KTG				The nuclear debate in Germany is characterized, on the one hand, by phasing out the use of nuclear power for electricity generation as pursued by the red-green German federal government since 1998 and also laid down in the Atomic Energy Act since 2002, and, on the other hand, by recent demands, also in political circles, to extend the operating life of existing nuclear power plants in the light of insufficient possibilities so far to substitute by renewable energies. Irrespective of the length of time for which nuclear power is to be used, it is the management of radioactive waste which needs to be settled at last. The repository issue must be addressed under the overall responsibility of the government and in a constructive joint effort by all stakeholders. Under the German Atomic Energy Act, it is the federal government which bears the key responsibility for the final storage of radioactive waste. As a consequence of the Gorleben and Konrad repository projects pursued by the federal government, Lower Saxony more than other federal states is required to work on the repository problem both in technical and in political respects. The Lower Saxony state government is in favour of -suspending the Moratorium on the exploration of Gorleben and continuing exploration without any preconceived notions about the outcome, -executing the plans approval decision to use the Konrad mine after having waited for pending court cases, -the federal government signing a new agreement with the federal states about waste management in favour of the locations mentioned above. The one-repository goal of the federal government must be abandoned because it is counterproductive under aspects of time and costs, and fails to take into account responsibility for future generations.

In the present work, the authors prepared carbon dust samples by two methods. One was deuterium (D-2) arc discharge with carbon electrodes to simulate co-deposition of carbon atoms with hydrogen atoms. The other was electron beam irradiation to carbon fiber composite (CFC) target in hydrogen gas to simulate disruptions. The dependence of retained hydrogen amount on hydrogen gas pressure and substrate temperature was investigated. The surface morphology and the crystal structure were also examined. In the case of D, arc discharge, the concentration of retained deuterium was increased with the deuterium gas pressure, but did not depend on substrate temperature from 573 to 723 K. Under the anticipated ITER divertor condition, namely deuterium gas pressure and substrate temperature were less than 1 Pa and 573 K, the deuterium concentration was 0.2 in the atomic ratio, D/C. In the case of electron beam irradiation, the amount of retained hydrogen was the same as the background level. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Unalan, S				Unalan, S			Power stabilization and temporal performance of a peaceful nuclear explosion reactor with a mixture of 90% flibe+10% UF4 (or ThF4)	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						power stabilization; hybrid reactors; peaceful nuclear explosion reactor	FUSION POWER	This work investigated the power stabilization and the temporal neutronic behavior of a peaceful nuclear explosion reactor (PACER) with ThF4 and UF4, which produces an electrical energy of 1.2 GW from fusion explosions of 8.13 x 10(12) J to be repeated every 40 min during the operation period of 30 year. The use of ThF4 and UF4 is realized by a mixture zone consisted of flibe and fuel. instead of full flibe zone. The mixture compositions determined by volume fraction are 90% flibe +10% UF4, 90% flibe +10% ThF4 and 90% flibe +5 % UF4 + 5 % ThF4. The capacity factor of the reactor is 0.75. The cylindrical explosion chamber has a radius of 30 m and a height of 75 m. The mixture mass of 18,000 tonnes having a zone thickness of 5 m were circulated during the operation period. The mixture zone would be subdivided into jets so that the gas and the vapor bypasses the liquid as it vents and does not accelerate the liquid mixture to high velocities. The selected volume fraction is 75% void +25% mixture. The use of fuel materials in the PACER reactor resulted in high-energy production, sufficient tritium breeding and significant fissile fuel breeding. The averages of tritium breeding ratio (TBR) values over 30 years are between 1.1 and 1.17. Generally, the mixtures with UF4 show better performance than the mixture with ThF4. For the mixtures with ThF4, ThF4 + UF4 and UF4, the energy production without the separation process reached from approximate to1430 MW (electric), 1700 MW (electric) and approximate to2000 MW (electric) to approximate to1900 MW (electric), approximate to2150 MW (electric) and approximate to2320 MW (electric), respectively. The reached cumulative fissile fuel enrichments in the fuel (CFFE) in percentage are 1.8, 2.45 and 2.4%, respectively. The fuel obtained from the PACER could be used as a nuclear fuel only in the CANDU and the advanced CANDU In addition, the stabilization process is performed by means of the plutonium or uranium fuel separation from the mixture, after the energy output of the reactor reaches 1600 MW (electric), 1800 MW (electric) and 2000 MW (electric) at the operation periods of 11, 6 years and 2 months, respectively. At the end of the separation process, the separated fuel amounts are about 15, 374 and I I tonnes, respectively. The CFFE values of the separated fuel at the end and at the start up of the separation process are 99.36 and 99.23%, 1.13 and 3.9%, and 99.99 and 99.2%, respectively. The CFFE values of the remained fuel at the end of the separation process are approximate to0.7, and 2.2%, approximate to0.7%, respectively. Consequently, in the evaluation in terms of sufficient tritium breeding, high energy production, significant fissile fuel production and the nuclear weapon hazard of the fuel, the mixture of 90% flibe +5% ThF4 + 5% UF4 exhibited the highest performance.

J	Linke, JM; Hirai, T; Rodig, M; Singheiser, LA				Linke, JM; Hirai, T; Rodig, M; Singheiser, LA			Performance of plasma-facing materials under intense thermal loads in tokamaks and stellarators	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th International Stellarator Workshop	SEP 22-26, 2003	Greifswald, GERMANY			plasma-facing components; high-heat-flux testing; carbon-based materials	ITER; COMPONENTS; DESIGN	Beside quasi-stationary plasma operation, short transient thermal pulses with deposited energy densities on the order of several tens of MJ/m(2) are a serious concern for next-step devices, in particular, for tokamak devices such as ITER. The most serious of these transient events are plasma disruptions. Here, a considerable fraction of the plasma energy is deposited on a localized surface area in the divertor strike zone region. The timescale of these events is typically on the order of I ins. In spite of the fact that a dense cloud of ablation vapor will form above the strike zone, only partial shielding of the divertor armor from incident plasma particles will occur. As a consequence, thermal shock-induced crack formation, vaporization, surface melting, melt layer ejection, and particle emission induced by brittle destruction processes will limit the lifetime of the components. In addition, dust particles (neutron-activated metals or tritium-enriched carbon) are a serious concern from a safety point of view. Other transient heat loads that occasionally occur in magnetic confinement experiments such as instabilities in the plasma positioning (vertical displacement events) also may cause irreversible damage to plasma-facing components (PFCs), particularly to metals such as beryllium and tungsten. Other serious damage to PFCs is due to intense fluxes of 14-Me V neutrons in D-T burning plasma devices. Integrated neutron fluence of several tens of displacements per atom in future thermonuclear fusion reactors will degrade essential physical properties of the components (e.g., thermal conductivity). Another serious concern is the embrittlement of the heat sink and the plasma-facing materials (PFMs). To investigate the performance of carbon-based and metallic PFMs under the aforementioned thermal loads, simulation experiments have been performed in highly specialized high-heat-flux test facilities. The neutron-induced degradation of materials and components was investigated on selected test samples that were irradiated in high-flux material test reactors.

J	Bucalossi, J				Bucalossi, J		Tore Supra Team	Problems and issues for tokamak long-pulse operation: Major progress on Tore Supra	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th International Stellarator Workshop	SEP 22-26, 2003	Greifswald, GERMANY			long-pulse operation; superconducting tokamak; noninductive discharge		During winter 2001-2002, the Tore Supra tokamak went through a major upgrade to provide a heat extraction capability of 25 MW in steady state (composants internes et limiteur project). In the new configuration, the operational domain has experienced a rapid extension. Indeed, discharges of more than 4 min have been performed with a world-record-breaking discharge accounting for 0.75 GJ of injected/extracted energy. Stationary discharges with fully noninductively driven current are performed routinely (typical parameters: plasma current, 0.52 MA; toroidal magnetic field, 4 T; lower hybrid power, similar to3 MW, electron line density, 2.5 X 10(19) m(-2)), limited in duration by the original lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) system. Ion cyclotron waves [ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH)] have been coupled to plasma for I min in combination with LHCD in a higher-density scenario (Greenwald fraction of 0.8, 0.11 GJ of injected ICRH power for 0.42 GJ total injected power) and with a substantial fraction of bootstrap current (15 to 20%). Electron cyclotron current drive experiments are also carried out: A new world record of electron cyclotron injected energy has been established in a single electron cyclotron resonance heating pulse of 32 s (25 MJ). In these discharges, stable central electron temperature oscillations sometimes appear, probably due to the interplay between heat transport and current drive. Density profile peaking is observed despite the absence of toroidal electric field, suggesting the existence of a turbulent inward pinch. Finally, particle balance analyses indicate that the in-vessel deuterium inventory never reaches saturation. Many carbon deposits and flakes have been found in the inner vessel, possibly playing a role in the fuel retention.

This paper describes the estimated doses to the thyroid glands of the 3,440 evaluable participants in the Hanford Thyroid Disease Study, which investigated whether thyroid morbidity was increased in people exposed to radioactive iodine from Hanford during 1944-1957. The participants were born during 1940-1946 to mothers living in Benton, Franklin, Walla Walla, Adams, Okanogan, Ferry, or Stevens Counties in Washington State. Whenever possible someone with direct knowledge of the participant's early life (preferably the participant's mother) was interviewed about the participant's individual dose-determining characteristics (residence history, sources and quantities of food, milk, and milk products consumed, production and processing techniques for home-grown food and milk products). Default information was used if no interview respondent was available. Thyroid doses were estimated using the computer program Calculation of Individual Doses from Environmental Radionuclides (CIDER) developed by the Hanford Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project. CIDER provided 100 sets of doses to represent uncertainty of the estimates. These sets were not generated independently for each participant, but reflected the effects of uncertainties in characteristics shared by participants. Estimated doses (medians of each participant's 100 realizations) ranged from 0.0029 mGy to 2823 mGy, with mean and median of 174 and 97 mGy, respectively. The distribution of estimated doses provided the Hanford Thyroid Disease Study with sufficient statistical power to test for dose-response relationships between thyroid outcomes and exposure to Hanford's I-131.

J	Hilton, J; Harvey, M; Simmonds, J				Hilton, J; Harvey, M; Simmonds, J			The combined impact on doses to man of multiple, authorized, radionuclide discharges for the year 1999 reaching the upper River Thames, UK	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						monitoring; environmental; waste management; environmental impact; quality assurance		Before issuing a new or revised authorization to discharge liquid radioactive waste to a river, past and current practice has been to assess the impact of each discharge on a site-by-site basis. This paper reports an assessment of the combined impact of all the (year 1999) authorized discharges in the upper River Thames (UK) catchment. A modification of the PC-CREAM model, using parameters specific to the upper River Thames, was used to estimate "potential doses" to the population, using the authorized discharge activity for each of the discharges as the main driving variable. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the difference in doses between single and multiple discharges in the Thames. A partial validation of the model against measurements was also carried out as a secondary investigation. The source term of the upper Thames consisted of 90 authorized discharges for 86 sites, made up of three nuclear licensed sites, 36 industrial discharges, 25 research organizations, 20 hospitals and two miscellaneous organizations. Of the authorized discharges, nuclear sites constituted 67% of the total activity in authorizations to discharge; hospitals 16%, research organizations 13%, and industry only 3%. Three radionuclides made up 96% of the total authorized discharge activity: tritium-74%; Tc-99m-15%, and C-14-7%. No other single radionuclide constituted more than 1.5% of the total activity. All of the discharges from non-nuclear sites were via a sewage works so that, in total, only 39 discrete discharges to the river were included in the model. For the purposes of the assessments, it was assumed that all discharges were at the authorized limits (rather than using actual discharge). Even with this maximizing assumption, all the calculated potential doses from the combined source terms were significantly less than the radiation dose limit of 1 mSv y(-1) for a member of the public. The highest estimated potential doses were investigated further to identify the major pathways. Ingestion of fish was the main pathway in several river stretches and in the highest case constituted 97% of the dose. In a few stretches, external irradiation from the riverbank or ingestion of drinking water were the main pathways, but the potential contribution was a very small percentage (<1%) of the dose limit for members of the public. An investigation of the reasons for the relatively high potential doses resulting from fish showed that the radionuclide with the largest contribution was P-32. Three factors had a major effect on potential dose estimations in these circumstances: the fish consumption rate, the P-32 concentration factor and the Use Of P-32 in some cases to represent radionuclides authorized for discharge as "any other radionuclide, except alpha emitters." Using the precautionary principle, all authorized activity in the latter designation was modeled as the radionuclide which would produce the highest dose to humans.

We have recently demonstrated a non-isotopic carrier effect of some common calcium salts (calcium = 9 mg mL(-1)) to reduce the whole body retention of radiostrontium, if administered within 2 h after radiostrontium exposure and furthermore once daily, in rats, supplemented with calcium fortified diet. However, 25-30 % of radiostrontium (compared to 50-60 % in untreated animals) was still found to be retained in the animal even after 2 wk of treatment. Trial of some simple interventional measures, which would not adversely affect the animal metabolism, like pyrophosphate and magnesium sulfate, sodium citrate, chitin (a bio-absorbent), crown ether (a metal-chelator), and ammonium chloride, was therefore attempted to dislodge this remaining radiostrontium by switching over these animals to normal diet and subjecting them to different lines of treatment with these simple interventions through diet and drinking water separately for a further 4 wk. However, this remaining portion of radiostrontium is fixed in the bone and is difficult to dislodge.

DU, a component of U.S. munitions and tank armor, was first used during that conflict. Two hundred and twenty-seven veterans submitted samples for analysis from January 2000 through December 2002, which included a 24-h urine sample for determination of total urinary uranium concentration and completed questionnaires describing their wartime exposure experiences. Thirty questionnaire items characterizing DU exposure opportunities were collapsed into 19 exposure categories. Urine uranium (U) results were stratified into low and high uranium groups with 0.05 mug U g(-1) creatinine as the cut point. Exposure scenarios in the high and low uranium groups were similar in frequency and type with only the presence of retained shrapnel being predictive of a high urine uranium value, as found in the first phase of this surveillance of 169 veterans performed prior to 2000. Twenty-two veterans exhibited U levels in the high range. Isotopic analysis, available for 21 of these 22, revealed that all but three of these samples contained natural and not depleted uranium. These three participants had retained DU shrapnel as a result of their past injuries. Thus, even with an enlarged cohort, elevated urine uranium values in the absence of retained DU fragments are unlikely. The utility of isotopic analysis to more fully characterize uranium biomonitoring results is also demonstrated.

Mass spectroscopic analysis indicated that the average atom% of U-235 was 0.198 +/- 0.10, consistent with depleted uranium. Other major elements present were iron, aluminum, and silicon. About 47% of the total mass was particles with diameters <300 mum, of which about 14% was <10 mum. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the uranium was present in the sample as uranium oxides-mainly U3O7 (47%), U3O8 (44%) and UO2 (9%). Depleted uranium dust, instilled into the lungs or implanted into the muscle of rats, contained a rapidly soluble uranium component and a more slowly soluble uranium component. The fraction that underwent dissolution in 7 d declined exponentially with increasing initial burden. At the lower lung burdens tested (<15 mug DU dust/lung) about. 14% of the uranium appeared in urine within 7 d. At the higher lung burdens tested (similar to80-200 mug DU dust/lung) about 5% of the DU appeared in urine within 7 d. In both cases about 50% of that total appeared in urine within the first day. DU implanted in muscle similarly showed that about half of the total excreted within 7 d appeared in the first day. At the lower muscle burdens tested (<15 mug DU dust/injection site) about 9% was solubilized within 7 d. At muscle burdens >35 mug DU dust/injection site about 2% appeared in urine within 7 d. Natural uranium (NU) ore dust was instilled into rat lungs for comparison. The fraction dissolving in lung showed a pattern of exponential decline with increasing initial burden similar to DU. However, the decline was less steep, with about 14% appearing in urine for lung burdens up to about 200 mug NU dust/lung and 5% at lung burdens >1,100 mug NU dust/lung. NU also showed both a fast and a more slowly dissolving component. At the higher lung burdens of both DU and NU that showed lowered urine excretion rates, histological evidence of kidney damage was seen. Kidney damage was not seen with the muscle burdens tested. DU dust produced kidney damage at lower lung burdens and lower urine uranium levels than NU dust, suggesting that other toxic metals in DU dust may contribute to the damage.

J	Mao, YH; Lin, LB; Liu, YG				Mao, YH; Lin, LB; Liu, YG			Measuring method of undamaged samples for the radiation levels of decorative building materials	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						exposure; population; naturally occurring radionuclides; alpha particles; gamma radiation		When natural radionuclides are well distributed in materials, there is a fixed interrelationship between activities in any part of the material and the surface flux of alpha and beta rays. Placing an alpha detector on the surface can estimate radionuclide activities in the materials without damaging samples. This paper studied the relationship between gamma ray specific activities of natural radionuclides and alpha ray surface flux of decorative building materials. The results show that when the surface alpha ray activities of granite are less than 0.0052 Bq cm(-2), or the surface alpha ray activities of polished tiles are less than 0.0082 Bq cm(-2), their internal and external exposure indexes are in the range of "A" limits of national criteria of China, Limit of radionuclides in building materials. Because there is a great difference between the radioactive levels of the surface glaze and the matrix of color-glazed tiles, the natural radionuclides are not well distributed in color-glazed tiles, and the ratio between the alpha surface activity and the gamma ray activity in unit mass is not fixed. The surface alpha ray flux of materials cannot be used to estimate the internal and external exposure indexes of color-glazed tiles.

J	Metzger, R; Cole, L				Metzger, R; Cole, L			Solubility characterization of airborne uranium from a uranium recycling plant	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						uranium; lungs; human; dose assessment; inhalation		Solubility profiles of uranium dusts in a uranium recycling plant were determined by performing in vitro solubility tests on breathing zone air samples conducted in all process areas of the processing plant. The recycling plant produces high density shields, closed end tubes that are punched and formed from uranium sheet metal, and high-fired uranium oxide, which is used as a catalyst. The recycled uranium is cut and melted in a vacuum furnace, and part of the molten uranium is poured into molds for further processing. Air samples were taken in process areas under normal working conditions. The dissolution rate of the uranium in a simulant solution of extracellular airway lining fluid (Gamble's solution) was then determined over the next 28 d. Airborne uranium in the oxide section of the plant was found to be highly insoluble with 99% of the uranium having a dissolution half time in excess of 100 d. The solubility of the airborne uranium in other areas of the facility was only slightly more soluble with over 90% of the airborne uranium having dissolution half times in excess of 90 d.

J	Levchuk, D; Koch, F; Maier, H; Bolt, H				Levchuk, D; Koch, F; Maier, H; Bolt, H			Deuterium permeation through Eurofer and alpha-alumina coated Eurofer	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							HYDROGEN PERMEATION; MARTENSITIC STEEL; BARRIERS; COATINGS; MANET	Experiments on deuterium permeation through Eurofer have been performed in the temperature range 573-873 K at driving pressures 10(3)-10(5) Pa. The permeability is found to be coincident with literature data on Eurofer measured at a fixed pressure and on F82H steel as well. A crystalline alumina coating of I mum in thickness produced on the surface by means of filtered arc discharge has led to a marked decrease of the permeation flux compared to bare material in the temperature range 973-1073 K. Surface effects appear to play a noticeable role in this decrease. In spite of this, a reduction factor of 10(3), perfect layer stability to thermal cycling, and a relatively low deposition temperature make alpha-alumina a very promising material for fusion applications.

The Pu 4f, O Is and C Is binding energy regions were line shape fit to unequivocally demonstrate that multiple species are present. Surface hydroxyls were ubiquitous in all PuO2 samples exposed to H2O vapor or ambient air, and persisted with heating to 590 degreesC. Active surface sites for the reaction of H2O and other small molecules and spectral features consistent with pure stoichiometric No, can be regenerated by thermal energy or by effects of a radiation field. Evidence of higher valence Pu species was observed in some treated samples with the formula PuO2+x. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The equilibrium stoichiometry deviation in the hyper-stoichiometric fuel has been derived from thermodynamic considerations using a self-consistent set of thermodynamic properties for the U-O system, which emphasizes replication of solubilities and three-phase invariant conditions displayed in the U-O binary phase diagram. The kinetics model accounts for multi-phase transport including interstitial oxygen diffusion in the solid and gas-phase transport of hydrogen and steam in the fuel cracks. The fuel oxidation model is further coupled to a heat conduction model to account for the feedback effect of a reduced thermal conductivity in the hyper-stoichiometric fuel. A numerical solution has been developed using a finite-element technique with the FEMLAB software package. The model has been compared to available data from several in-reactor X-2 loop experiments with defective fuel conducted at the Chalk River Laboratories. The model has also been benchmarked against an O/U profile measurement for a spent defective fuel element discharged from a commercial reactor. Crown Copyright (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Smith, RE				Smith, RE			Drying characteristics of thorium fuel corrosion products	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							OXIDE-WATER SYSTEM; THORIA/NITRIC/HYDROFLUORIC ACID SYSTEM; THERMAL-DECOMPOSITION; GRAVIMETRIC ADSORPTION; DISSOLUTION MECHANISMS; LOW-TEMPERATURES; SURFACE AREA; IMMERSION; HEATS; CARBONATE	The open literature and accessible US Department of Energy-sponsored reports were reviewed for the dehydration and rehydration characteristics of potential corrosion products from thorium metal and thorium oxide nuclear fuels. Mixed oxides were not specifically examined unless data were given for performance of mixed thorium-uranium fuels. Thorium metal generally corrodes to thorium oxide. Physisorbed water is readily removed by heating to approximately 200 degreesC. Complete removal of chemisorbed water requires heating above 1000 degreesC. Thorium oxide adsorbs water well in excess of the amount needed to cover the oxide surface by chemisorption. The adsorption of water appears to be a surface phenomenon; it does not lead to bulk conversion of the solid oxide to the hydroxide. Adsorptive capacity depends on both the specific surface area and the porosity of the thorium oxide. Heat treatment by calcination or sintering reduces the adsorption capacity substantially from the thorium oxide produced by metal corrosion. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In Japan waste forms buried in a shallow burial disposal facility as low level radioactive waste must be solidified by cement or other materials with adequate strength and must provide no harmful opening. The authors have developed an improved method to minimize radioactive waste volume by utilizing radioactive concrete for fine aggregate for mortars to fill void space in waste containers. Tests were performed with pre-placed concrete waste and with filling mortar using recycled fine aggregate produced from concrete. It was estimated that the improved method substantially increases the waste fill ratio in waste containers, thereby decreasing the total volume of disposal waste.

The powder was obtained from SiC ceramics containing B4C, of which B-10 concentration was 4.2x10(16) atom/mg. Neutron irradiation was conducted up to a fluence of 2.8x10(24) n/m(2) (E>0.1 MeV) at similar to300 degreesC. The diffusion coefficients were calculated for the temperature region of 750-1.060 degreesC with time range of 0-10 min. The diffusion coefficient of helium for SiC containing B4C was D (cm(2)/s)=1.38x10(-10) exp[-0.91+/-0.07 (eV/atom)/kT]. Dissociative and interstitial diffusion mechanisms were supposed. Diffusion coefficients were reduced above similar to1,160 degreesC probably due to accelerated migration of vacancies.

J	Sahin, S; Yildiz, K; Acir, A				Sahin, S; Yildiz, K; Acir, A			Power flattening in the fuel bundle of a CANDU reactor	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							COMPOSITION HETEROGENEITY ANALYSIS; ECONOMIC-ANALYSIS; COST; REACTIVITY; THORIUM; CYCLE	The strong non-uniformity of the fission power production density in the CANDU fuel bundle could have been mitigated to a great degree. A satisfactory power flattening has been achieved through an appropriately evaluated method by varying the composition of the LWR spent fuel/ThO2 Mixture in a CANDU fuel bundle in radial direction and keeping fuel rod dimensions unchanged. This will help also to greatly simplify fuel rod fabrication and allow a higher degree of quality assurance standardization. Three different bundle fuel charges are investigated: (1) the reference case, uniformly fueled with natural UO2, (2) a bundle uniformly fueled with LWR spent fuel, and (3) a bundle fueled with variable mixed fuel composition in radial direction leading to a flat power profile (100% LWR spent fuel in the central rod, 80% LWR + 20% ThO2 in the second row, 60% LWR + 40% ThO2 in the third row and finally 40% LWR + 60% ThO2 in the peripheral fourth row). Burn-up grades for these three different bundle types are calculated as similar to7700, similar to27,300, and 10,000 MW.D/MT until reaching a lowest bundle criticality limit of k(infinity) = 1.06. The corresponding plant operation periods are 170, 660, and 240 days, respectively. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Park, KS; Koh, HM; Song, J				Park, KS; Koh, HM; Song, J			Cost-effectiveness analysis of seismically isolated pool structures for the storage of nuclear spent-fuel assemblies	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							TANKS; DESIGN	This study introduces a method for evaluating cost-effectiveness of seismically isolated pool structures, taking account of fluid-structure interaction effects. As a measure of cost-effectiveness, the procedure estimates minimum life-cycle cost, sum of initial construction cost and excepted damage cist over life-cycle of the structure. The expected damage cost is the function of failure probabilities. which are computed by frequency domain analysis for convenience. Input ground motions are represented by a power spectral density function compatible with site-dependent response spectrums. The interaction effects between flexible walls and contained fluid are considered in the form of the added mass matrix. The thickness of wall and the stiffness of isolator are considered two key design variables in achieving a design with minimum life-cycle cost. The numerical examples show that seismically isolated pool tanks are highly cost-effective in low-to-moderate seismic regions. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To carry out nuclear reaction studies using the low-intensity RIB, a compact geometry detector system has been installed at the HIRA focal plane. The new detector setup consists of a Multi-Wire Proportional Counter (MWPC) followed by a DE-E detector telescope. The MWPC is used for obtaining the RIB profile and normalization. Fast timing signal of the MWPC is also used for the time-of-flight measurements for correction of energy spread of the RIBs in event mode. The detector telescope consists of a gas ionization chamber which gives energy loss (DE), followed by a two-dimensional position-sensitive silicon detector which gives residual energy and position. The telescope provides particle identification, energy and reaction angle information. The measured position resolution of the MWPC is about 0.9 mm (FWHM). The detector setup has also been used in stable beam experiments as well where the MWPC provides mass spectrum of the recoils at the RMS focal plane according to their position.

As required by the French legislation, an extensive theoretical study was conducted before decommissioning to establish the possible activation paths both in the accelerator and in the four experiments (L3, ALEPH, OPAL and DELPHI) installed around the ring. The aim was to define which areas may contain activated material and which ones would be completely free of activation. The four major sources of activation in LEP, i.e., distributed and localized beam losses, synchrotron radiation and the superconducting RF cavities, were investigated. Conversion coefficients from unit lost beam power to induced specific activity were established for a number of materials. A similar study was conducted for the four experiments, evaluating the four potential sources of induced radioactivity, namely e(+)e(-) annihilation events, two-photon events, e(+)e(-) Bhabha scattering events and beam-related radiation, i.e., synchrotron radiation and off-momentum beam particles. Decommissioning started early in 2001 and was completed by February 2002. Every single piece removed from the machine tunnel and experimental areas was double-checked for induced radioactivity, with complementary gamma-spectrometry measurements performed on samples of the various materials. The measurements have to a large extent confirmed the predictions. The overall intent of this paper is to provide data and computational guidelines for assessing induced radioactivity in high-energy electron accelerators, which could be of use in future decommissioning.

A reflection mode geometrical arrangement involving a Y-foil excited by the 59.54 keV gamma-rays from the Am-241 radioisotope as photon source and an HPGe/Si(Li) detector was used. The measurements were performed under vacuum similar to10(-2) Torr. Special care was taken in determination of the incident photon intensity and geometrical factors and to check effects due to occurrence of Bragg diffraction from the target lattice. The measured elastic scattering cross-sections have been compared with predictions from the form-factor formalism and relativistic second-order S-matrix calculations. The modified form-factor (MF) cross-sections are higher up to 50%, than the measured ones in the case of elements with the electron binding energy (BE) in vicinity of the incident photon energy and are lower up to 20% for the other elements. These deviations are smoothed by incorporating the Anomalous Scattering Factors (ASFs) to the MF values [Acta Cryst. A 46 (1990) 170]. The S-matrix values exhibit general agreement with the measured cross-sections. The measured inelastic scattering cross-sections are found to be in good agreement with those calculated using the Klem-Nishina cross-section incorporating the Hartree-Fock incoherent scattering function (ISF).

The application of P-delayed particle decay beams like C-9 ions in cancer therapy is expected to further improve the treatment efficacy of the modality of heavy-ions. For the first time C-9 beams were produced in the secondary beam line (SBL) of the HIMAC facility with a primary C-12 beam of 430 MeV/n. The production conditions providing a C-9 beam with higher production rate and purity were optimized using different thick production targets and degraders. The results show setting the momentum acceptance to the full value of 5% the production rate is 9.07 x 10(-6) and the purity is 82.88% for the produced C-9 beam under the optimal condition. Because of the large momentum spread for a secondary beam, the momentum distribution of the produced C-9 beam at the optimal condition was measured. The momentum among the beam had a nearly Gaussian profile with a standard deviation of 26.1 MeV/c/n and the largest component of the momenta appeared around 838.9 MeV/c/n. In order to form a relatively large uniform irradiation field being appropriate to further biological experiments for the produced C-9 beam, the scanning magnets in the irradiation system of the SBL, operating in a wobbling mode, was used. A uniform irradiation field of 20 mm in diameter could be achieved with homogeneity of 93.8%. The work presented in this paper provides a substantial basis for the further studies with 9C beams for the therapeutic purpose. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Williams, MMR				Williams, MMR			A stochastic problem arising in the storage of radioactive waste	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article								Nuclear waste drums can contain a collection of radioactive components of uncertain activity and randomly dispersed in position. This implies that the dose-rate at the surface of different drums in a large assembly of similar drums can have significant variations according to the physical makeup and configuration of the waste components. The present paper addresses this problem by treating the drum, and its waste, as a stochastic medium. It is assumed that the sources in the drum contribute a dose-rate to some external point. The strengths and positions are chosen by random numbers, the dose-rate is calculated and, from several thousand realizations, a probability distribution for the dose-rate is obtained It is shown that a very close approximation to the dose-rate probability function is the log-normal distribution. This allows some useful statistical indicators, which are of environmental importance, to be calculated with little effort. As an example of a practical situation met in the storage of radioactive waste containers, we study the problem of "hotspots." These arise in drums in which most of the activity is concentrated on one radioactive component and hence can lead to the possibility of large surface dose-rates. It is shown how the dose-rate, the variance, and some other statistical indicators depend on the relative activities on the sources. The results highlight the importance of such hotspots and the need to quantify their effect.

The configuration cores were 22.86 and 45.72 cm square and were reflected with 8.13-cm-thick and 10.16-cm-thick side polyethylene reflectors, respectively. The configurations had 10.16-cm-thick top and bottom polyethylene reflectors. For some configurations, the Rossi-alpha, which is an eigenvalue characteristic for a particular configuration, was measured to establish a reactivity scale based on the degree of subcriticality. These experiments provided critical mass data in the thermal energy range for systems containing Si, Mg, Al, Gd, and Fe. The measured k(eff) from these experiments was compared with the calculated k(eff) from MCNP using ENDF/B-V and ENDF/B-VI cross-section data. The observed biases were +0.005 Deltak and +0.008 Deltak for Si, +0.0006 Deltak and +0.008 Deltak for Al, +0.0023 Deltak for Mg, +0.004 Deltak and +0.01304 Deltak for Gd, and +0.0123 Deltak and -0.00106 Deltak for Fe.

J	Hofmann, D				Hofmann, D			Compression and heating of a gaseous deuterium-tritium mixture by means of cascaded light gas guns and its possible application to nuclear fusion	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article								A projectile penetrates with high velocity the lid of a gas receptacle, compresses and heats a statically precompressed volume of a gaseous deuterium-tritium mixture, and may possibly start fusion reactions by releasing and focusing a shock wave. A high amount of energy is delivered to a small volume in a very short time. The wall of the receptacle and the high density of projectile and receptacle material act as confinement. For the acceleration of projectile and receptacle, a series of interconnected (cascaded) and modified light gas guns is used. In the first part of this note, technical aspects are outlined. By a synchronized operation of the light gas guns, projectile and receptacle hit each other in the center of a reaction chamber. If fusion reactions can be started, a gas-cooled high-temperature moderator, containing breeding material for tritium, will surround the reaction chamber. In the second part the shock wave propagation and focusing is described in approximation. The results should encourage a precise theoretical treatment of the problem.
