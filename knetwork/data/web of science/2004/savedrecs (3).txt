This paper endeavors to analyze and evaluate the costs and benefits associated with the use of a network of radiation detectors for applications involving the detection of a moving radioactive source. This analysis is restricted to the one-dimensional case, i.e., to the case where the moving source is constrained to move along a single path. It is found that the relative advantage resulting from sensor dispersal depends upon the goals, objectives, and constraints of the measurement scenario. The dispersal of sensors into a network may be advisable or required for operational reasons, but from a statistical perspective does not directly lead to improved performance in terms of detection efficiency and false detection rate.

The novel "stripixel" detector concept developed by the BNL Instrumentation Division was applied to the first prototype silicon sensor. The novel feature of the stripixel concept is two-dimensional (2-D) position sensitivity with single-sided processing achieved by charge sharing between two interleaved electrodes in one pixel. Signals are read out projectively by double layers of aluminum strips. The first prototype stripixel sensors with the size of 34.3 x 64.6 mm and thickness of 250 and 400 mum were fabricated. The detector with readout electronics was constructed to evaluate the prototype sensor performance by using an analog multiplexer chip with charge sensitive preamplifier-shaper circuits (VA2 chip of IDEAS). The sensor performance on charge sharing, detection efficiency, signal-to-noise ratio, and position resolution has been tested with a radioactive source and a GeV particle beam at KEK-PS. The stripixel detector concept, the specification of the first prototype stripixel sensor, and the test results are presented.

This room temperature imaging system for single photon counting has been developed within the Medipix2 European Collaboration for various imaging applications with X-rays and gamma rays, including dental radiography, mammography, synchrotron radiation, nuclear medicine, and radiation monitoring in nuclear facilities. The Medipix2 + CdTe hybrid detector features 256 x 256 square pixels, a pitch of 55 mum, a sensitive area of 14 x 14 mm(2). We analyzed the quality of the detector and bump-bonding and the response to nuclear radiation of the first CdTe hybrids. The CdTe pixel detectors, with Pt ohmic contacts, showed an ohmic response when negatively biased up to less than 60 V (electrons collection mode). Tests were also performed in holes collection mode, where a nonresistive behavior was observed above + 15 V. We performed a series of imaging tests at low voltage bias with gamma radioactive sources and with an X-ray tube. Under uniform irradiation, we observed for all detectors the presence of numerous, stable structures in the form of small circles of about 200 mum diameter, with the central pixels showing a reduced counting efficiency with respect to the periphery (in electrons counting regime). Also long filament structures have been observed. Further investigations will reveal whether they are due to an intrinsic detector response (e.g., due to Te inclusions) or to the bump-bonding process.

We report on the comparative NEMA NU 2-2001 performance tests on four different Siemens/CTI ECAT PET scanners, the two bismuth germanate oxide scanners HR+ and EXACT and the two lutetium oxyorthosilicate scanners ACCEL and EMERGE. All scanners were operated in 3-D mode only. Until now, no complete NEMA NU 2-2001 evaluations have been reported for the HR+ and EXACT. For the ACCEL and the EMERGE, these are the first published performance characteristics as far as we know. The HR+ showed a superior spatial resolution, whereas the ACCEL had the best countrate [noise equivalent count (NEC)] performance above a radioactivity concentration of 2 kBq/cc. The sensitivity of the full-ring scanners did not differ much with numbers between 5982 and 7180 cps/MBq. The sensitivity of the partial-ring scanner EMERGE was 2279 cps/MBq. Although the EMERGE yields lower NEC rates than the EXACT for radioactivity concentrations less than 10 kBq/cc, it is favorable beyond this cross over point. The scatter fraction of all four scanners was about 48%. The lesions to be examined by the image quality test could be seen best with the ACCEL. The NEMA NU 2-2001 performance tests proved to be a valuable guideline for this instrumental comparison.

Materials and methods: Rats were pre-exposed intraperitoneally to either CdCl2 or Pb(CH3COO)(2). 9 or 15 h later they received Po-210 nitrate intravenously. The retention and excretion of Po-210 via the urine and faeces of pre-exposed rats, as well as in pre-exposed rats treated with DMPS, were followed. The radioactivity due Po-210 in a broad spectrum of body tissues and excreta was measured by the liquid scintillation counting after sample digestion in a mixture of perchloric acid and hydrogen peroxide. The immunohistochemical localization of metallothioneins (MT) was studied using a mixture of murine monoclonal antibodies directed against MT I + II. Results: The present study revealed different tissue distributions of polonium-210 in the rats pre-exposecd to lead or cadmium ions when compared with that in Po-210 only controls. Under combined exposure to Pb or Cd, the spontaneous excretion of Po-210 was enhanced and could be further enhanced by treatment with DMPS. Treatment with this chelator was efficient even when its start was postponed until 24h after internal contamination of the body with Po-210. Conclusions: Polonium-210 is bound in vivo to binding sites on various biomolecules, among them erythrocytic enzymes and MT. This phenomenon explains the different affinity and overall distribution of Po-210 in control body tissues. When the appropriate binding sites are occupied by lead or cadmium, enhanced natural excretion of polonium-210 occurs.

Materials and methods: Experiments were performed oil plutonium oxide (PuO2) and two Mixed Oxide (MOx) preparations containing 5% Pu (w/w) made according to the industrial process in vitro using a static test and in vivo after rat inhalation. Results: Behaviour of Pu and Am shows, in vitro, at shorter times, a greater rapid dissolution fraction f(r) for Pu (factor 10) and Am (factor 2) with MOx powders compared with PuO2, whereas in vivo results show a greater fraction f(r) for Pu (factor 5) and Am (factor 15) with PuO2 compared with MOx powders. This phenomenon has not been observed for slow dissolution absorption parameter s(s). The in vivo parameters for Pu and Am in these materials were very close to the default values recommended by International Commission for Radiological Protection for default Type S. Conclusions: Results obtained have shown that solubility of Pu from the mixed oxide was higher than that of Pu from PuO2. Nevertheless, no significant difference was observed between the three compounds in the corresponding close coefficients in vivo or in vitro. Therefore, for these particular compounds, variation in the chemical composition of the aerosols had no significant influence oil DPUI Consequently In vitro, the dissolution test call provide a good estimate of the in vivo behaviour. Studies of variation of % Pu (w,/w) from MOx are in progress in our laboratory to confirm these conclusions.

J	Heisbourg, G; Hubert, S; Dacheux, N; Purans, J				Heisbourg, G; Hubert, S; Dacheux, N; Purans, J			Kinetic and thermodynamic studies of the dissolution of thoria-urania solid solutions	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							OXIDIZING CONDITIONS; SOLUBILITY PRODUCT; X-RAY; FUEL; WATER; XPS; UO2	The dissolution of Th1-xUxO2 was investigated through leaching experiments combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analyses. These experiments were performed in acidic and in oxidizing conditions (nitric solutions), for several compositions of solid solutions ranging from x = 0.24 to 0.81. Static sequential experiments in acidic media performed at room temperature confirmed that higher concentration of uranium in the solid solution leads to higher release of uranium in the leachate whatever the pH. The normalized dissolution rate in oxidizing media is increasing all the more the content of uranium is increases in the mixed oxide. While for Th enriched solids, kinetic parameters remain similar to that of ThO2, in the case of uranium enriched solids, a drastic change is observed, and kinetic parameters are similar to that Of UO2 ones. For x > 0.50, the saturation is reached in the leachate after 100 days. XPS and EXAFS analysis on leached samples pointed out an oxidation of U(IV) at the surface for x < 0.5, and in the bulk for x > 0.5. Enrichment in Th is also observed at the surface of the solid, indicating the formation of a protective layer of hydrated thorium oxide, or hydroxide. Finally, the solubility product of secondary phase was determined. The values obtained are in good agreement with that of ThO2, Th(OH)(4) and ThO2, xH2O reported in the literature.

Such materials, in which the actinides (or lanthanides used as actinide surrogates) would be preferentially incorporated into zirconolite crystals homogeneously dispersed in a durable glassy matrix, can be prepared by controlled crystallization (nucleation + crystal growth) of parent glasses belonging to the SiO(2)-Al(2)O(3)-CaO-ZrO(2)-TiO(2) system. In this work we present the effects of the nature of the minor actinide surrogate (Ce, Nd, Eu, Gd, Yb, Th) on the structure, the microstructure and the composition of the zirconolite crystals formed in the bulk of the glass-ceramics. The amount of lanthanides and thorium incorporated into zirconolite crystals is discussed in relation with the capacity of the glass to accommodate these elements and of the crystals to incorporate them in the calcium and zirconium sites of their structure.

The plates were submitted to a heat flux of maximum 353 W/cm(2) while the surface cladding temperature is kept below 130 degreesC. After 40 full power days, visual examination and profilometry of the fuel plates revealed an increase of the plate thickness. In view of this observation, the irradiation campaign was prematurely stopped and the fuel plates were retrieved from the reactor, having at their end-of-life a maximum burn-up of 32.8% U-235 (6.5% FIMA). The microstructure of one of the fuel plates has been characterized in an extensive post-irradiation campaign. The U(Mo) fuel particles have been found to interact with the Al matrix, resulting in an interaction layer which can be identified as (U,Mo)Al-3 and (U,Mo)Al-4. Based on the composition of the interaction layer it is shown that the observed physical parameters like thickness of the interaction layer between the Al matrix and the U(Mo) fuel particles compare well to the values calculated by the MAIA code, an U(Mo) behavior modeling code developed by the Commissariat l'energie atomique (CEA).

Following the observation of the present authors that the isotope exchange reaction 2 is much faster than the isotope exchange reaction 1, the release curve of bred tritium obtained at purge with humidified gas was used for estimation of the effective diffusivity of bred tritium in LiAlO2. Then, the effective diffusivity of tritium in grain of LiAlO2 is obtained as D-T = 2.5 x 10(-7) exp(-110 [kJ]/RT) [m(2)/s]. This equation gives the larger diffusivity than any other diffusivity presented so far because the mass transfer resistance at the grain surface is expected to be eliminated in the estimation procedure of this study.

For ion energies ranging from 300 to 1000 eV, temperature enhancement of liquid tin sputtering was noted. These measurements were obtained by IIAX (the Ion-surface InterAction eXperiment) using a velocity-filtered ion beam at 45degrees incidence to sputter material from a liquid tin target onto deposition monitors. Sputtering yields from 500 eV ion bombardment at 45degrees incidence increase from 0.1 +/- 0.03 and 0.019 +/- 0.008 Sn particles/ion at room temperature, for He+ and D+ ions respectively, to 0.30 +/- 0.12 and 0.125 +/- 0.05 Sn particles/ion for 380 degreesC. Temperature enhanced sputtering has been seen in other liquid metals (namely lithium, tin lithium, and gallium) using both ion beam and plasma irradiation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations and electron probe micro analysis (EPMA) were carried out for the test rod as a part of destructive tests after the pulse irradiation. Fission gas release during pulse irradiation was evaluated by EPMA and puncture test. Xenon depression was observed in the fuel pellet after pulse irradiation at periphery and center region. It is considered that the xenon depression at pellet periphery was due to rim structure formation and fission gas was mainly released from the pellet center region during pulse irradiation. Comparing the fractional fission gas release during pulse irradiation with other results of out-of-pile annealing tests, it was concluded that most fission gas, which was accumulated at grain boundary during base irradiation, was released from the center region of test fuel pellet during pulse irradiation.

The concept of nanopores was originally proposed by Rama and Moore. The present paper has evolved this concept into more specific grain configurations to estimate radon emanation coefficients by theoretical calculations. These configurations cover combinations of nanopore geometry and radium distribution in grains. Radium is the parent nuclide of radon. Assuming isotropic emission of radon from its birthplace with recoil energy imparted by the decay of radium, the present calculation led to nearly the same high radon emanation coefficients as measured; these were as high as 0.18 under moist conditions. Therefore, it was theoretically verified that even small pores of nanometer size may contribute to high radon emanation.

Dimensions of reactor core components depend on their temperatures due to the thermal expansion phenomena. However, the variation of calculation geometry requires considerable computational load for trajectory based lattice transport calculations such as the characteristics method since ray tracing must be re-executed. Therefore, if a correction on cross sections can accurately capture the effect of geometrical variation due to the thermal expansion, computation time of a lattice transport calculation that treat temperature variation can be reduced. Three different corrections on cross sections were tested in PWR fuel assembly geometry using UO2 and MOX fuels. It was found that the correction of cross sections that preserves neutron attenuation in a region almost reproduce the reference calculation that explicitly considers geometrical variation due to the thermal expansion. The result of this paper will be useful for lattice calculations in production analysis since material temperatures are frequently changed in such analysis to cover various reactor conditions.

In the experiments, argon gas containing 20.7% oxygen and 1.2% water vapor was fed to the anode at a rate of 47137 m//min at 600-800degreesC and an applied voltage until 3.5 V. The resulting hydrogen evolution rate reached maximally 0.67 ml/min and the hydrogen recovery rate was 60%. However, the proton transport number decreased to 0.52 because the electron-hole current increased along with protonic current according to the defect equilibrium reaction occurring under a wet atmosphere containing oxygen. During operation, the hydrogen evolution rate fluctuates over time by at least 0.1 ml/min, which is approximately 20% of the hydrogen evolution rate. Additionally, the hydrogen evolution rate increased with an increase in the partial pressure of water vapor at the anode. It is important to design the tritium monitoring system taking into consideration the fluctuation in hydrogen evolution rate.

J	Fujimoto, N; Nojiri, N; Ando, H; Yamashita, K				Fujimoto, N; Nojiri, N; Ando, H; Yamashita, K			Nuclear design	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								The high-temperature engineering test reactor (HTTR) has been designed for an outlet temperature of 950degreesC. That is the highest temperature in the world for a block-type high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR). The functions of the reactivity control system are determined considering the operational conditions, and the reactivity balance is planned so that the design requirements are fully satisfied. Moreover, the reactivity coefficients are evaluated to confirm the safety characteristics of the reactor. The power distribution in the core was optimized by changing the uranium enrichment to maintain the fuel temperature at less than the limit (1600 degreesC). Deviation from the optimized distribution due to the burnup of fissile materials was avoided by flattening time-dependent changes in local reactivities. Flattening was achieved by optimizing the specifications of the burnable poisons. The original nuclear design model had to be modified based on the first critical experiments. The Monte Carlo code MVP was also used to predict criticality of the initial core. The predicted excess reactivities are now in good agreement with the experimental results. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The reactor containment vessel is designed to withstand the temperature and pressure transients and to be leak-tight in the case of a rupture of the primary concentric hot-gas duct, etc. The pressure inside the service area is maintained at a negative pressure by the emergency air purification system. The emergency air purification system will also remove airborne radioactivity and will maintain a correct pressure in the service area. The leak-tightness characteristics of the containment structures are described in this paper. The measured leakage rates of the reactor containment vessel were enough less than the specified leakage limit of 0.1%/d confirmed during the commissioning tests and annual inspections. The service area was kept in a way that the design pressure becomes well below its allowable limitation by the emergency air purification system, which filters efficiency of particle removal and iodine removal well over the limited values. The obtained data demonstrate that the reactor containment structures were fabricated to minimise the release of fission products in the postulated accidents with fission product release from the reactor facilities.

The design of remaining utility systems is described in this paper. They are: auxiliary helium systems, which include the helium purification system, the helium sampling system, the helium storage and supply system; fuel handling and storage system. The helium purification systems are installed in the primary and secondary helium cooling systems in order,to reduce the quantity of chemical impurities. The helium sampling systems monitor the concentration of impurities. The helium storage and supply systems keep the steady pressure of the helium system during the normal operation. The fuel handling and storage system is utilised to handle the new- and spent-fuels safely and reliably. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our calculations were compared with measurements of the direct and moderated flux distributions and agreement was achieved within 20%. Further, the present simulations were compared with the resolution functions established earlier with a dedicated program and with measured data for 56 Fe. Here too, the agreement is excellent. New IAEA photonuclear libraries were implemented to perform these calculations. The simulations crucially rely on the new MCNP4C3 photonuclear capabilities and are made efficient by using the variance reduction and TALLYX features. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Four sampling sites at an average distance of about 35 km from a coal-fired thermoelectric power plant were selected: Acegua, Aeroporto, 8 de Agosto and Pedras Altas. Samples were collected from December 2000 to December 2001, and their PM10 mass concentrations (coarse and fine particles) were determined. Moreover, the concentration of the elements Si, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn and Br were obtained through the PIXE technique. The average mass concentrations of coarse and fine particles were found to be well below the daily (150 mugm(-3)) and annual average (50 mugm(-3)) air quality standards established by the country's legislation. The high enrichment factors observed in the fine fraction particulate (<2.5 mum) suggests that anthropogenic activities were the dominant source for elements such as S, V, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn and Br. Analysis performed with HV PM10 samples showed a grouping of the elements Si, K, Ca, Ti, Mn and Fe, indicating coal and earth crust as the possible sources of these elements, whereas the presence of S is associated to coal combustion. The elements Cr, Ni and Cu characterise the influence of the power plant, while the presence of Cl and Br is associated with the presence of marine salts in the area. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This artificial nuclide can be produced through Am-241 neutron capture carried on in a neutron field typical of a thermal reactor. In order to suppress the thermal neutron flux, which will cause Am-242m depletion mainly through fission, proper neutron filters should be adopted. In a very intense neutron field, the Am-242m enrichment depends mainly on the energy distribution of the neutrons, the sample thickness, and the cutoff energy of the neutron filter. An investigation on different geometries of the sample to be irradiated using Cd, B, Sin, and Gd as neutron filters has been carried out by means of Monte Carlo simulation. The mostfavorable results have been obtained irradiating thin Am-241 samples (11 mug/cm(2)) covered with a Gd (0.2-mm-thick) or Sm (1-mm-thick) filter. In these cases the theoretical Am-242m enrichment can reach 20%. The preparation of significant quantities of this unconventional nuclear fuel implies isotopic separation techniques operating in high radioactive environments and hopefully characterized by very high recovery factors, which are in no way trivial problems.

However, a range of anomalies has been discovered recently. There has also been significant progress for medium-Z hydrogenic and helium-like atoms. In this area tests are often based on X-ray spectroscopic measurements. Future prospects for critical insight into the nature and convergence of QED in multi-electron systems will be discussed.

The improvement and expansion of these techniques depend on the progress attained in several areas, such as radionuclide production, radiopharmaceuticals, radiation detectors and image reconstruction algorithms. This review paper will be concerned only with the detector technology. We will review in general terms the present status of medical radioisotope imaging instrumentation with the emphasis put on the developments of high-resolution gamma cameras and PET detector systems for scinti-mammography and animal imaging. The present trend to combine two or more modalities in a single machine in order to obtain complementary information will also be considered. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We present a crude prototype consisting of a single 500 mum thick, 256 pad silicon detector with pad size of 1.4 x 1.4 mm(2), combined with a 15 x 15 x 1 cm(3) NaI scintillator crystal coupled to a set of 20 photo multipliers. Emphasis is placed on the performance of the silicon detector and the associated read-out electronics, which has so far proved to be the most challenging part of the set-up. Results were obtained using the VATAGP3, 128 channel low-noise self-triggering ASIC as the silicon detector's front-end. The noise distribution (sigma) of the spectroscopic outputs gave an equivalent noise charge (ENC) with a mean value of <&sigma;> = 137 e with a spread of 10 e, corresponding to an energy resolution of 1.15 keV FWHM for the scattered electron energy. Threshold settings above 8.2 keV were required for stable operation of the trigger. Coincident Compton scatter events in both modules were observed for photons emitted by Co-57 source with principal gamma ray energies of 122 and 136 keV. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The detection and identification of slow protons and deuterons emerging from a deuterium cluster-jet target thus becomes feasible. A good measurement of the energy and angle of such a spectator proton (p(sp)) allows one to identify a reaction as having taken place on the neutron in the target and then to determine the kinematical variables of the ion-neutron system on an event-by-event basis over a range of c.m. energies. The system has been successfully tested under laboratory conditions. By measuring the spectator proton in the pd-->p(sp)dpi(0) reaction in coincidence with a fast deuteron in the ANKE Forward Detector, values of the pn-->dpi(0) total cross-section have been deduced. Further applications of the telescope include the determination of the luminosity and beam polarisation which are required for several experiments. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Dayras, F; Chauvin, N				Dayras, F; Chauvin, N			A contribution to improvement of the nuclear data concerning alpha decay of U-235	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						alpha-particle spectrometry; U-235; separation of stable and radioactive isotopes; unfolding; Monte-Carlo simulation; alpha-particle emission probabilities and energies	ELECTROMAGNETIC ISOTOPE SEPARATOR; SIDONIE; ENERGY	Compared to other alpha-particle emitting nuclides, for those with long half-lives (T-1/2 > 10(6) years), there is generally some inconsistency and inaccuracy in the associated nuclear data. However, these radionuclides play a major role in modern society and, for a number of reasons, are the subject of widespread interest. The study of their alpha decay, which is more difficult than in the case of the other nuclides, enables knowledge of their nuclear data to be increased. In the present paper, we accordingly consider one of the most well known ones: U-235. Using a quasi mono-isotopic deposit of U-235 obtained by electromagnetic separation, we have studied the alpha-particle decay of U-235 using a high-energy resolution spectrometer developed in our laboratory. The stability of the spectrometer made it possible to perform long measurements which is crucial in the case of U-235. The Colegram program, with a new fit criterion to better take into account peaks of low statistical significance, was used to extract the data (alpha-particle emission probabilities and energies). Monte-Carlo simulations carried out in the context of this work were also used to corroborate the data obtained. Finally, thirteen alpha-particle emissions from U-235 were measured, from which only ten were previously observed and measured. This work has substantially reduced the uncertainty concerning alpha-particle emission probability and energy values and has resolved some of the ambiguities concerning the U-235 disintegration scheme to Th-231.

They increase the light yield of these detectors by factors of 2.5 and 8.8, respectively. Technical challenges like long-term stability in various media, high reflectivity and radiopurity have been addressed and the concepts to overcome these difficulties will be described. Gamma spectroscopy measurements of the concentrators show an upper limit of 12 muBq/g for uranium and a value of 120 muBq/g for thorium. Upper limits on other possible contaminations like Al-26 are presented. The impact of these results on the performance of Borexino and the CTF are discussed and it is shown that the design goals of both experiments are fulfilled. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This type of method suffers from several limitations, the most limiting of which are the impossibility to make wall thickness correction or to take the inference of foreign radioisotopes into account. The NaIGEM software (A guide for using NaIGEM code, version 1.5 for DOS and Windows, 2001; Nucl. Instr. and Meth. A 458 (2001) 196) was developed to overcome these limitations by calculating the 186 keV line intensity with a fitting procedure. The code was tested in different measurement conditions on the wide variety of certified samples, in particular, on reprocessed uranium and on depleted material with thick steel filters interposed between the source and the detector. The results are presented to illustrate the performance and limitations of the tested version (A guide for using NaIGEM code, version 1.5 for DOS and Windows, 2001). The general performance is good except in the case of low-enriched uranium in thick containers. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For the same average multiplication ratio as in the standard equilibrium cycle, the reactivity would vary by 1% over a 1-yr microrun, which requires partial reloadings approximately every month. The spectral part of the void coefficient of reactivity is 20% higher than for the standard cycle. Sixty-one kilograms of americium are transmuted in 1 yr of reactor operation. For high Pu-238 content in the fuel, the americium transmutes predominantly into fission products. Americium in the spent fuel from eight VVER-1000 reactors can be transmuted in a similar regime in a BREST-1200 reactor (with spent-fuel storage time 30 yr and a high americium content due to Pu-241 decay).

J	Blekher, AY; Kuchin, NL; Sergeev, IV				Blekher, AY; Kuchin, NL; Sergeev, IV			Radiation consequences of seawater contamination during floating storage of reactor-compartment units from salvaged nuclear-powered submarines	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The storage time before salvaging of decommissioned nuclear-powered submarines and the floating storage time of reactor units from salvaged submarines can total decades. During this time, radioactive contamination of seawater occurs as a result of the corrosion of the pressure hull in the region of the reactor system and rupturing of the pressure hull - as a result of corrosion of the components of the reactor system. A computational analysis shows that under standard storage conditions the specific activity of water is 10(5)-10(6) times lower than the intervention level. In the case when the hull and the reactor system are destroyed even with remaining fuel, the specific activity of the sea water near the point of sinking also does not exceed the intervention level because of the slow emission of fission products and transuranium nuclides.

However, the penetration depth and fueling efficiency can be greatly limited when enhanced pellet ablation by fast particles occurs. Only a limited database exists for the penetration depth of ice pellets into stellarators. The penetration depth is measured during pellet injection into purely electron cyclotron resonance heated plasmas on the Wendelstein 7-AS (W7-AS) stellarator. These data are compared with the International Pellet Ablation Database (IPADBASE). Good agreement is found, if the neutral gas shielding model is applied for the scaling law of the penetration depth. The experimental data from W7-AS are used as a basis for planning a new pellet injection system for the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator, which is now under construction.

J	Kase, KR				Kase, KR			Radiation protection principles of NCRP	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	39th Annual Meeting of the National-Council-on-Radiation-Protection-and-Measurement	APR 09-10, 2003	Arlington, VA	Natl Council Radiat Protect & Measurements		national council on radiation protection and; measurements; radiation protection; safety standards; regulatory guides		The current recommendations of the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) relative to ionizing radiation are based on radiation protection principles that developed historically as information about radiation effects on human populations became available. Because the NCRP Charter states that the NCRP will cooperate with the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), the basic principles and recommendations for radiation protection of the NCRP are closely coupled with those of the ICRP. Thus, the fundamental principles of justification, optimization, and dose limitation as initially stated in ICRP Publication 26 have been adopted and applied by the NCRP in its recommendations. ICRP and NCRP recommendations on dose limitation for the general public and for occupationally exposed individuals are based on the same analyses of radiation risk, and, while similar, there are differences reflecting the aspects of radiation application and exposure circumstances unique to the United States. The NCRP has recently extended its guidance to address exposure to individuals engaged in space activities. Several reports have been issued or are in preparation to provide recommendations on dose limitation and the development of radiation safety programs to apply the radiation protection principles in space activities. The biological basis for these recommendations is provided in these and accompanying NCRP reports. Recommendations for the application of basic radiation protection principles have been made in many reports over the years. Those that are most current appear in approximately 50 reports published in the last 15 y. These address radiation safety practices in industrial and medical institutions, control of radionuclides in the environment, protection of the public, and assessment of radiation risk. Some of the aspects of these recommendations will be discussed. Current recommendations related to radiation safety practice are based on the principles and dose limits specified in Report No. 116. The limits are based on estimates of the risk of fatal cancer and an assessment of the risk that should be tolerated by workers who are occupationally exposed and by the general public. These levels of risk are related to other risks that individuals accept in their lives. Looking to the future, one might consider other directions that the NCRP could take in developing radiation safety recommendations that are still based upon the stated principles, such as relating dose to loss of life expectancy instead of fatal cancer risk. It may also be that the principles of justification, optimization, and dose limitation should be reconsidered. For example, the NCRP may make recommendations about the relationship of radiation dose to various biological effects or outcomes and the resulting estimates of risk, but not specify dose limits. This would relieve the NCRP of the necessity to speculate about acceptable risks. One can also imagine that the principle of justification could be applied not only to the introduction of a new source of radiation, but also to the removal of an existing source of radiation, i.e., the idea of justifying decontamination efforts. It is clear that as we move into the 21st century there will be a continuing need for the NCRP to identify the principles upon which radiation protection is to be based and to provide guidance on the application of those principles for the many beneficial uses of radiation and radioactive materials in society.

J	Gonzalez, AJ				Gonzalez, AJ			Radiation safety standards and their application: International policies and current issues	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	39th Annual Meeting of the National-Council-on-Radiation-Protection-and-Measurement	APR 09-10, 2003	Arlington, VA	Natl Council Radiat Protect & Measurements		national council on radiation protection and; measurements; international atomic energy agency; safety standards; regulatory guides		This paper briefly describes the current policies of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation and the International Commission on Radiological Protection and how these policies are converted into international radiation safety standards by the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is the only global organization-within the United Nations family of international agencies-with a statutory mandate not only to establish such standards but also to provide for their application. It also summarizes the current status of the established corpus of such international standards, and of it foreseeable evolution, as well as of legally binding undertakings by countries around the world that are linked to these standards. Moreover, this paper also reviews some major current global issues related to the application of international standards, including the following: strengthening of national infrastructures for radiation safety, including technical cooperation programs for assisting developing countries; occupational radiation safety challenges, including the protection of pregnant workers and their unborn children, dealing with working environments with high natural radiation levels, and occupational attributability of health effects (probability of occupational causation); restricting discharges of radioactive substances into the environment: reviewing current international policies vis-a-vis the growing concern on the radiation protection of the "environment;" radiological protection of patients undergoing radiodiagnostic and radiotherapeutic procedures: the current International Action Plan; safety and security of radiation sources: post-11 September developments; preparedness and response to radiation emergencies: enhancing the international network; safe transport of radioactive materials: new apprehensions; safety of radioactive waste management: concerns and connections with radiation protection; and radioactive residues remaining after the termination of activities: radiation protection response to the forthcoming wave of decommissioning of installations with radioactive materials. The ultimate aim of this paper is to encourage information exchange, cooperation, and collaboration within the radiation protection professional community. In particular, the paper tries to facilitate consolidation of the growing international regime on radiation safety, including the expansion of legally binding undertakings by countries, the strengthening of the current corpus of international radiation safety standards, and the development of international provisions for ensuring the proper worldwide application of these standards, such as a system of international appraisals by peer review.

They are responsible for regulating both man-made and naturally occurring radioactive material, radiation-producing machines, and nonionizing sources of radiation. This broad-scope authority presents challenges to state radiation regulatory agencies that must implement and maintain a regulatory framework that incorporates radiation safety principles for all types of uses, without unduly hindering effective use of sources of radiation. The challenges include resource allocation, prioritization of risk in order to appropriately allocate resources, and the ability to effectively predict and respond to changing risk-informed priorities. Changes in radiation protection principles and policies must be accomplished through a partnership of stakeholders to be most effective and to meet these challenges.

Materials and methods: Groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were contaminated by intravenous injection of either Pu citrate, Pu nitrate or Pu phytate. Pu content was determined in various tissues at different times after injection. Pu liver distribution was analysed by autoradiography and after cellular separation. Results: Biokinetic studies indicate that Pu citrate and Pu nitrate predominantly retained in the skeleton within the first hours after injection, whereas most of the Pu was in the liver after injection of Pu phytate. Autoradiographs showed that Pu citrate was homogeneously distributed in the liver, while Pu nitrate accumulated into 'hot points'. Pu phytate showed an intermediate distribution pattern. Hepatic cell separation revealed a difference of uptake between the two cell types depending on the chemical form of injected Pu, and on the time after contamination. Conclusions: Distinct Pu behaviour was observed for biokinetics, retention and liver distribution. The large differences noted between citrate, nitrate and phytate might be explained by differences in systemic and hepatic transport.

J	Ubeyli, M				Ubeyli, M			Reducing effective liquid wall thickness in a HYLIFE-II fusion breeder	JOURNAL OF FUSION ENERGY			English	Article						fusion; tritium breeding; radiation damage	POWER-PLANT DESIGN; REACTOR; BLANKET	One of the major inertial fusion energy reactor designs is HYLIFE-II which uses protective flowing liquid wall between fusion plasma and solid first wall. The most attractive aspect of this reactor is that protective liquid wall eliminates the frequent replacement of the first wall structure during reactor lifetime. Liquid wall thickness must be at least the thickness required for supplying sufficient tritium for the deuterium-tritium (DT) driver and satisfying radiation damage on the first wall below the limits. Reducing this thickness results less pumping power requirements and cost of electricity. In this study, investigation on potential of utilizing refractory alloys (W-5Re, TZM and Nb-1Zr) as first wall to reduce effective liquid wall thickness in HYLIFE-II reactor using liquid wall of Flibe + 10 mol % UF4 mixture. Neutron transport calculations were carried out with the help of the SCALE4.3 system by solving the Boltzmann transport equation with the XSDRNPM code in 238 neutron groups and a S-8-P-3 approximation. Numerical results showed that using W-5Re or TZM as first wall was effective in decreasing liquid wall thickness in contrast to Nb-1Zr.

Three different fertile fuels (Th-232, U-238 and Cm-244), and one fissile fuel (U-235) were selected as the nuclear fuel. Two different coolants ( pressurized helium and natural lithium) were used for the nuclear heat transfer out of the fuel zone (FZ). The Boltzmann transport equation was solved numerically for obtaining the neutronic parameters with the help of the neutron transport code XSDRNPM/SCALE4.4a. In addition, these calculations were performed by also using the MCNP4B code. The sub-limits of the mixture fractions and Li-6 enrichment were determined for the tritium self-sufficiency. The considered hybrid reactor can be operated in a self-sufficiency mode in the cases with the fuel mixtures mixed with a fraction of equal to or greater than these sub-limits. Furthermore, the numerical results show that the fissile fuel breeding and fission potentials of the blankets with the helium coolant are higher than with the lithium coolant.

The assessment of the heat capacity and phase diagram suggested that the deviation from the ideality in the PuO2-UO2 system is negligibly small. The calculated pseudo-ternary phase diagrams implied that the fluorite structure phase of PuO2-ZrO2 subsystem is more stable than that of UO2-ZrO2 subsystem in the lower temperature range and that the latter is more stable than the former in the higher temperature range. The effect of ZrO2 dissolution to PuO2 was larger both on the enthalpy and entropy of the fluorite structure phase than that to UO2 in the low ZrO2 composition range. On the other hand, UO2 had a larger effect on the stability of the fluorite structure phase in the high ZrO2 composition range. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Roth, J; Hopf, C				Roth, J; Hopf, C			Sticking coefficient and surface loss probability of eroded species during bombardment of carbon with deuterium	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							CHEMICAL EROSION; HYDROCARBON FILMS; HYDROGEN-IONS; GRAPHITE; RADICALS; DISCHARGES; IMPACT; YIELDS; GROWTH	Investigations on the deposition behaviour of eroded carbon species under controlled ion beam conditions were performed to evaluate absolute sticking coefficients. Pyrolytic carbon was eroded by D ions at energies between 45 eV and 1 keV and temperatures between 20 and 475 degreesC. The sticking coefficient of the eroded species was obtained from a quantitative comparison of the total deposition inside a cavity with the flux of carbon entering the cavity as well as from the distribution of deposited atoms inside the cavity. High sticking coefficients of the order of 0.6 were obtained at room temperature and high ion energy, as expected from physically eroded atoms. In contrast, hydrocarbon molecules chemically emitted at either elevated temperature or low ion energy have typical sticking coefficients around 0.02.
