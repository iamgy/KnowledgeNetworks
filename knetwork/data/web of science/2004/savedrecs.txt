The RD is based on the combination of an analyser foil used as neutron-to-gamma converter and a suitable photon detector. Here, we report on the state of the RD which is based on a YAP scintillator viewing a natural uranium analyser foil. The response of the YAP detector to the radiative capture gamma emission from the uranium analyser foil has been characterized with a bi-parametric measurement of a reference Pb sample, which allowed simultaneous measurements of both neutron time-of-flight and gamma pulse height (energy) spectra. The analysis of the gamma pulse height and neutron time-of-flight spectra permitted to identify the signal and background components. These measurements showed that a significant improvement in the signal-to-background ratio can be achieved by setting a lower level discrimination on the photon energy at about 600 keV. The first application of RD is the Very Low Angle Detector Bank (VLAD) which is planned to be installed in the next three years as an upgrade of the VESUVIO spectrometer, at the ISIS pulsed neutron source. VLAD will extend the (q,omega) kinematical to low wave vector transfers (q < 10 Angstrom(-1)) coupled to high-energy transfers ((h) over bar omega > 1 eV), which is still unexplored by neutron scattering experiments. The first measurements obtained on an ice sample with a VLAD prototype consisting of four RD units are presented here. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A description of this apparatus and first results from cosmic ray tests are presented. Additional measurements using simpler detectors with a laser source, an X-ray gun and radioactive sources are discussed. Drift velocity and gain measurements, electron attachment and aging studies for a Micromegas TPC are presented. In particular, using simulations and measurements, it is shown that an Argon-CF4 mixture is optimal for operation at a future Linear Collider. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The detector is made of low natural radioactivity materials and has a two-dimensional readout with X-Y strip structure. It is operated with an Argon/Isobutane (95%/5%) mixture and is controlled by a VME data acquisition system. The detector is sensitive to photons in the energy range of 1-10 keV, it has a linear response, excellent stability and a very good energy resolution (14% FWHM at 5.9 keV). This device has been in stable operation since October 2002, taking data during the running periods of the CAST experiment. At the end of summer 2003, the detector was upgraded with a flash ADC readout of the grid signal to further improve its background rejection capability. The currently achieved background rate under normal operation is about 2.0 x 10(-5) event s/keV/cm(2)/s with better than 85% software efficiency. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The short half-life of Rb-82 results in rapid decay of the administered radioactivity allowing repeat scans to be performed after a relatively short time interval. The Rb-82 is available from a Sr-82/Rb-82 generator in which the Sr-82 parent is immobilized on an ion exchange column and Rb-82 eluted when required. Consequently, suitable ion exchangers for use in a generator must have a very high affinity for strontium and a negligible affinity for rubidium, allowing the pure Rb-82 to be safely and efficiently eluted in high yields. This study evaluated a number of strontium-selective ion exchange materials using batch experiments and identified sodium nonatitanate as the best material for use in a Sr-82/Rb-82 generator.

Tritium was also detected in both [O-18]water recovered for recycling and waste acetonitrile solutions. The purified [F-18]FDG was not contaminated with H-3. The amount of H-3 discharged into the air was far less than the International Basic Safety Standard Level. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In (NaI)-I-125 and (NaCl)-Cl-36 concentration-cell system, electric ion and water conductances, phenomenological coefficients, have been experimentally determined on basis of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Prepared paper membrane had higher permselectivity of I-125 ion than Cl-36 ions by approximately 21%. On the other hand, water flux that was accompanied by an ionic transference in prepared paper membrane was greatly larger than that in typical synthesized membrane. It is suggested that a depression of water mobility is important to practice an ideal radioactive iodide waste electrodialysis system with a novel anion exchange paper membrane.

The timing of [C-11]CH3I delivery is critical for the high yield of radiolabeling, since in-loop radioactivity trapping is reversible. Trapped radioactivity escapes faster from a Tefzel loop compared to a PEEK- or stainless steel loop. Up to 50% of delivered radioactivity may be concentrated at the loop origin (representing 8.1% of the total loop volume). A five-fold reduction of the reaction solvent volume and/or precursor amount may lead to a decrease of the product radiochemical yield either by lowering the in-loop radioactivity trapping or by diminishing conversion of [C-11]CH3I into the product.

Interest in the neutron-emitting (252)Cf radioisotope as a radiotherapy nuclide has undergone a resurgence given recent efforts to fabricate HDR remotely afterloaded sources, and other efforts to create a miniature source for improved accessibility to a variety of anatomic sites. Therefore, HDR (252)Cf brachytherapy may prove to be a potential rival to the use of HDR (192)Ir remotely afterloaded brachytherapy-the current standard-of-care treatment modality using HDR brachytherapy. Considering the possible improvements in clinical efficacy using HDR (252)Cf brachytherapy and the enormous costs of other high-LET radiation sources, the cost differences between (252)Cf and (192)Ir may be well-justified.

Nucleophilic substitution of N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-nitro-5-bromophenylthio)benzylamine with K[F-18]/Kryptofix 2.2.2 in DMSO at 125degreesC followed by reduction with NaBH4-Cu(OAC)2 in EtOH at 78degreesC and purification with HPLC produces the desired compound with an unoptimized yield of similar to 5-10% in a synthesis time of 150 min from EOB. The biodistribution of 5-[F-18]-ADAM in rats showed a high initial uptake and relatively rapid clearance in the brain (3.221+/-0.762, 0.440+/-0.059, 0.160+/-0.035 and 0.028+/-0.003% injected dose/organ at 2, 30, 60 and 120 min after IN. injection, respectively) with the specific binding peaking at 1 h postinjection (hypothalamus/cerebellum and hippocampus/cerebellum were 2.97 and 3.59, respectively). The initial uptake in blood, lung, kidney and heart were also high, but it cleared rapidly. The radioactivity in the femur increased with time for 5-[18F]-ADAM indicating that in vivo defluorination may occur. Metabolism studies in rats showed that 5-[F-18]-ADAM was not metabolized in rat brain, but was metabolized rapidly in the blood. Blocking experiments showed that there were significant decreases in the uptake of 5-[F-18]-ADAM in the brain regions (hypothalamus, hippocampus and striatum) where SERT concentrations are high when rats were pretreated with (+)McN 5652 (2 mg/kg, 5 min prior to IV injection of 5-[F-18]-ADAM). These results suggest that 5-[F-18]-ADAM may be a potential new serotonin transporter PET imaging agent. However, due to its rapid wash-out from the brain, defluorination in vivo and lower uptake in the brain than 4-[F-18]-ADAM, 5-[F-18]-ADAM may not be as useful as 4-[F-18]-ADAM as a SERT imaging agent.

For a scintigraphic imaging comparison, three different Tc-99m-IDA derivatives, Tc-99m-DISIDA, Tc-99m-mebrofenin and Tc-99m-IOTIDA, were prepared and evaluated for their in vivo pharmacokinetic behavior through animal studies. Serial static image scans of rabbits injected with 99mTc-IOTIDA revealed that none of the tissues except the hepatobiliary system showed radioactivity concentrations. A scintigraphic study in a healthy volunteer showed that most of the administrated radioactivity accumulated in the liver and was rapidly excreted through the hepatobiliary system, visualizing the gallbladder within 15 min. In conclusion, 99mTc-IOTIDA is a potential hepatobiliary imaging agent for the evaluation of the functional status of hepatocytes and the patency of the biliary duct. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The purity of many C-11-radiopharmaceuticals was found to be low even at the end of synthesis and to lower with time by radiolysis. Examinations of the effects of radical scavengers showed that the radiopharmaceuticals were classified into four groups: Group I showing excellent stability; Group 2 showing suppressed radiolysis in the presence of a selective scavenger of hydroxyl radicals; Group 3 showing suppression in the presence of a selective scavenger of hydrated electrons; Group 4 showing suppression in the presence of both scavengers. Using appropriate additives according to these classes, C-11-radiopharmaceuticals were prepared with excellent radiochemical purity even with high levels of radioactivity and specific activity.

J	Shevchenko, SV				Shevchenko, SV			On the uncertainty in activity measurements for samples containing "hot particles"	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						radioactivity measurement; hot particles; measurement uncertainty	ENVIRONMENTAL-SAMPLES	The uncertainty in activity measurements for samples containing hot particles is considered under three assumptions: (1) all activity in the samples is due to hot particles; (2) hot particle dimensions are log-normally distributed with the logarithm of the median radius m and the standard deviation of the logarithm of the particle radius s; and (3) the number of particles in the sample is a random quantity. It is shown that the measurement uncertainty grows when both s and m increase. Also, that for s < 0.25-0.3 the primary source of uncertainty is the randomness of the number of particles in the sample, and, if s exceeds 0.3, the "log-normality" effect becomes more dominant. The values of the variance/uncertainty estimated by the measurement of replicate aliquots from a single sample can be used for the estimation of the m and s relationship and boundary values of these parameters.

The method has two main procedures. One is a point-source calibration at a representative point near the detector. The position of the representative point is determined by Monte Carlo simulations. The other is correction for absorption by a sample matrix and a sample container. This paper presents application of the method for obtaining efficiency curves for volume samples in the energy range from 22 to 1836 keV. In addition to the standard volume sources of cement and water matrices, measurement was made with some kinds of environmental samples that are often used in environmental monitoring for radiation control works. The composition of the environmental sample was determined by elemental analysis. For these samples, measured absorption correction factors were compared with those by the Monte Carlo simulations. As a result, detection efficiency curves were obtained with good accuracy for variety types of volume samples. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The standard method of evaporation at atmospheric pressure and a method based on freeze-drying using commercial equipment are compared. The preliminary results of this study obtained with Zn-65 sources are presented and a significant improvement of the detection efficiencies to the electron emission for freeze-dried sources is shown.

Homogeneity of the sample has been examined using three methods, viz. particle size distribution of the sample matrix, total alpha/beta counting and gamma spectrometry. In conjunction with Dixon and Grubb tests as statistical tools, ten random samples from the original sample were used for this investigation. Reference values for the three radium isotopes (Ra-224, Ra-226, Ra-228) were determined using gamma spectrometry equipped with HPGe detectors having high relative efficiencies of 80%, while the reference value of Pb-210 in the sample was determined using radiochemical separation and counting of its daughter Po-210 by alpha spectrometry. ANOVA analysis was used to estimate the uncertainties due to measurement and inhomogeneity of the sample; uncertainty due to inhomogeneity was found to be around 2.6 times the measurement uncertainty.

The low U-238 activity requires a large size soil sample with a mass of about 100 g. The geometrical and self-absorption effects as well as the density dependence of soil samples were then investigated. A procedure of analyzing environmental soil samples was established with a relative error of about 10%. Two soil samples of known activity were tested and 106 surface soil samples collected from the Southern part of Vietnam were analyzed, and then these results were compared by instrumental neutron activation analytical method.

The partial sensitivities rho(i) of the LR 115 detector to Rn-222 and its alpha-emitting short-lived progeny, Po-218 and Po-214, were investigated. We first determined the distributions of lengths of major and minor axes of the perforated alpha tracks in the LR 115 detector produced by Rn-222, Po-218 and Po-214 through Monte Carlo simulations. The track parameters were calculated using a track development model with a published V function, by assuming a removed active layer of 6.54 mum. The distributions determined for different alpha emitters were found to completely overlap with one another. This implied equality of partial sensitivities for radon and its progeny, which was also confirmed through analytical considerations. Equality of partial sensitivities makes possible convenient measurements of the proxy equilibrium factor F, which is defined in the present work as (F-1 + F-3) and is equal to the ratio between the sum of concentrations of the two alpha emitting radon progeny (Po-218 + Po-214) to the concentration of radon gas (Rn-222). In particular, we have found F-p = (rho/rho(i)tC(0)) - 1, where rho (track/m(2)) is the total track density on the detector, rho(i) = 0.288 x 10(-2) m, t is the exposure time and C-0 (Bq/m(3)) is the concentration of Rn-222. If C-0 is known (e.g. from a separate measurement), we can obtain F, The proxy equilibrium factor F, is also found to be well correlated with the equilibrium factor between radon gas and its progeny through the Jacobi room model. This leads to a novel method for long-term determination of the equilibrium factor. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The preparation of Marinelli beaker standards of milk powder containing (ThO2)-Th-232 at secular equilibrium with its daughter radionuclides was studied. Standards were prepared by mixing of known amounts of solid ThO2 and milk powder. The densities of the standards were 0.5-0.7 kg dm(-3). Measurements of calibrated Marinelli beaker standards with HPGe detector showed that the energy dependence of the efficiency is similar to that of a point source, i.e. an almost linear dependence of log-efficiency vs. log-energy in the 200-2000 keV range, however the parabolic correlation fits better. The validity of these standards was checked by comparison with certified standard reference material IAEA-152-Milk powder containing radiocesium and radiopotassium. The results obtained were found to be in a good agreement with the published certified data. The limit of detection for the determination of radiocesium, by gamma ray spectrometry under the prevailing experimental conditions is 0.03 Bq (i.e. 0.8 pCi), for samples of dairy products having lower densities of 0.7 kg dm(-1).

The nuclear transmutation occuring in the materials of the structures under irradiation in the reactor and during the subsequent holding period is simulated by the CHAIN program for calculating the isotopic composition and the radiation characteristics on the basis of the MCNP fluxes. Some results of a calculation of the radiation characteristics of the structures in the reactors in the No. 2 and No. 3 units of the Leningrad and No. I unit of the Chernobyl nuclear power plants are presented. Estimates of the total activity of the reactors structures and the dose rate near individual components are presented.

J	Heller, W				Heller, W			Financing governmental duties by fees?	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								The tendency towards the financing of governmental duties by fees is unbroken. A current example is the plan of the federal environment minister to transfer the responsibility for the final storage of radioactive wastes to a public legal association. All waste producers must become a member of this association. The task of carrying out the search, exploration and establishment of a final repository should be assigned to this association. The conditions for the financing of such tasks in Germany are very restricted. The proposed model is not compliant with the lagal framwork. The strategic goals of such an approach should have been determined by the government.									0	0	0	0	0	VERLAGSGRP HANDELSBLATT GMBH	DUSSELDORF	POSTFACH 10 11 02, D-40002 DUSSELDORF, GERMANY	1431-5254			ATW-INT J NUCL POWER	ATW-Int.

This paper is divided into three sections. First, the geometry, loading features, and tritium concentrations in liquid lithium of tritium breeding zones in blankets are described. Then, a tritium flowchart corresponding to the tritium fuel cycle system is constructed, and the SWITRIM code is developed for calculation of the inventories in the ten subsystems. Results show that the necessary initial tritium storage to start up the reactor with fusion power of 143 MW is similar to317 g. Finally, a tritium leakage analysis under different operation circumstances is performed. It is found that the potential danger of tritium leakage could result from the exhausted gas of the divertor system. It is important to elevate the tritium burnup fraction and reduce the tritium throughput.

The release curves were obtained in a series of experiments carried out using out-pile temperature programmed desorption techniques in the Kyoto University Reactor (KUR). Tritium release curves obtained for different purge gas compositions (N-2, N-2 + H-2, N-2 + H2O) were compared for selection of suitable conditions to determine the apparent diffusivity of tritium in a crystal grain of Li4SiO4. In the model formation, some mass transfer steps in the bulk of the crystal grain and those on the surface of the grain were taken into account, which. were diffusion of tritium in the grain, adsorption and desorption of water on the surface of the grain, two types of isotope exchange reactions, and water formation reaction by the addition of hydrogen to the purge gas. Diffusivities of tritium in the crystal grain of Li4SiO4 were estimated using a curve fitting method applied to the release curve obtained when the irradiated sample was purged by nitrogen with water vapor because of the fastest tritium release rate observed.

J	Peterson, SR				Peterson, SR			Test of CAP88-PC's predicted concentrations of tritium in air at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						tritium; air sampling; emissions; atmospheric; radioactivity; airborne		Based on annual tritium release rates from the five sources of tritium at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the Tritium Research Laboratory at Sandia National Laboratory, the regulatory dispersion and dose model, CAP88-PC, was used to predict tritium concentrations in air at perimeter and offsite air surveillance monitoring locations for 1986 through 2001. These predictions were compared with mean annual measured concentrations, based on biweekly sampling. Deterministic predictions were compared with deterministic observations using predicted-to-observed ratios. In addition, the uncertainty on observations and predictions was assessed: when the uncertainty bounds of the observations overlapped with the uncertainty bounds of the predictions, the predictions were assumed to agree with the observations with high probability. Deterministically, 54% of all predictions were higher than the observations, and 96% fell within a factor of three. Accounting for uncertainty, 75% of all predictions agreed with the observations; 87% of the predictions either matched or exceeded the observations. Predictions equaled or exceeded observations at those sampling locations towards which the wind blows most frequently, except those in the hills Under-predictions were seen at locations towards which the wind blows infrequently when released tritium was from elevated sources. When a high fraction of tritium was from area (diffuse) sources, predictions matched observations.

The facility has been in operation since 1978 to support the development, fabrication, and testing of Pu-238 heat sources for the U.S. Department of Energy. Several workers were in the room at the time of the release and in vivo study of five of the workers began the day after the exposure event. Four of the subjects subsequently received chelation therapy. Over 30 fixed air filter samplers (FASs) and four continuous air monitors (CAMs) were operating in the room during the radiological release. One 47-mm-diameter glass fiber FAS filter and one 25-cm-diameter mixed cellulose ester CAM filter containing Pu aerosol from the incident were examined in the study described here. Total alpha radioactivity on the filters was determined by gross alpha counting. Isotopic identification of the Pu-238 was made by alpha spectrometry. Film autoradiography was used to characterize the spatial distribution of alpha-emitting particles on the filters. Track-etch autoradiography was used to estimate the distribution of alpha radioactivity in individual plutonium particles on the filters for particle size measurement. The glass fiber filter was then cut into six sections. Particles from two sections were resuspended in alcohol, dispersed as an aerosol using a Lovelace nebulizer, and characterized by aerodynamic diameter using a Lovelace Multi-jet cascade impactor. The measured activity median aerodynamic diameter from the cascade impactor was 4.8 mum with a geometric standard deviation of 1.5. That agreed with the size distribution obtained from the alpha track detection technique. The remaining four filter sections were used in an in vitro dissolution study with synthetic serum ultrafiltrate. The retention of undissolved Pu-238 was consistent with a biphasic exponential function. The majority of the Pu-238 dissolved with a half-time of 900 d. The information on particle size distribution and solubility from this study was useful in assigning a radiation dose to the exposed workers, supporting the decision to administer chelation therapy, and providing a model for characterizing accident-associated aerosols in the future.

J	DeVol, TA; Woodruff, RL				DeVol, TA; Woodruff, RL			Uranium in hot water tanks: A source of tenorm	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						uranium; naturally occurring radionuclides; groundwater; radioactivity; environmental	UNITED-STATES	Uranium deposits were detected inside hot water tanks using gamma-ray spectroscopic techniques and corroborated by the difference in the uranium concentration of the groundwater entering and leaving the hot water tanks. In-situ gamma-ray spectroscopy was performed using a transportable high-purity germanium (HPGe) gamma-ray spectrometer to estimate the mass of uranium in the hot water tanks. Gammaray spectroscopic analyses of hot water tanks in four residences with groundwater uranium concentration between 732 and 7,667 mug L-1 revealed an estimated 3.5 to 69 g of uranium in each hot water tank. The uranium deposit within the tanks was indicated by the 143.8, 163.4, and 185.7 keV gamma rays of U-235 and confirmed with the 63.3, 92.3, and 92.8 keV gamma rays of Th-234 as well as the 1,001 keV peak of (234)mPa. An average decrease in uranium concentration of 23% was observed in the groundwater that passed through the hot water tanks. Additionally, once "uranium free" water entered the hot water tanks, the uranium deposits within the tanks resulted in an increase in the uranium concentration in the effluent water. The groundwater had an alkalinity in the range of 46-96 mg L-1 as CaCO3 and a pH range of 7.3-8.1. The accumulation of uranium in these hot water tanks results in them being classified as technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials (TENORM).

Two different types of mixing, namely, homogeneous mixing (HM) and linear mixing (LM) were used to investigate the uniformity of fission power distribution through the fuel zone. In HM, fraction of uranium content were kept constant in all rows of the fuel zone whereas, in LM the fraction of the uranium were linearly increased from the first to last fuel row in the fuel zone. Neutron transport calculations were performed with the aid of the SCALE4.3 system by solving the Boltzmann transport equation with the XSDRNPM code in 238 neutron groups and a S-8-P-3 approximation. Flat fission power distribution was maintained successfully for the blanket using linearly mixed fuels. However, the fission density profile was not uniform in the blanket with homogeneously mixed fuels. It decreased exponentially form the 1st to 10th fuel row.

A plot of lattice parameter versus composition of the ferrites (MgxNi(1-x)Fe2O4, x less than or equal to 1) showed an abrupt deviation of lattice parameter linearity near MgFeO4. The deviation was explained in terms of the distribution of Mg2+ in the octahedral and tetrahedral sites of the oxygen lattice. In XPS spectra, a broadening of the Mg 1s peak in Ni rich Mg-Ni ferrites from that observed in pure MgFe2O4, was explained by changes in the distribution of Mg2+ ion in tetrahedral and octahedral sites. A depth distribution of Mg in Ni0.5Mg0.5Fe2O4 showed an enrichment of Mg on surface. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The SRIM code has been used to simulate triton implantation and define the tritium source in each kind of material as a function of the depth. The TMAP4 code was used to analyse the posterior transitory gas transport process within the material, while taking into account the tritium transport properties of each material and the temperature variation through material thickness and operating time. Both the transient evolution and the final steady-state tritium transport behaviour have been characterised. The tritium transient flux to the coolant, the recycling flux and the absorbed tritium transient inventories have been simulated. Main conclusions have been drawn about the tritium performance of each first wall. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zagar, T; Bozic, M; Ravnik, M				Zagar, T; Bozic, M; Ravnik, M			Long-lived activation products in TRIGA Mark II research reactor concrete shield: calculation and experiment	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article								In this paper, a process of long-lived activity determination in research reactor concrete shielding is presented. The described process is a combination of experiment and calculations. Samples of original heavy reactor concrete containing mineral barite were irradiated inside the reactor shielding to measure its long-lived induced radioactivity. The most active long-lived (gamma emitting) radioactive nuclides in the concrete were found to be Ba-133, Co-60 and Eu-152. Neutron flux, activation rates and concrete activity were calculated for actual shield geometry for different irradiation and cooling times using TORT and ORIGEN codes. Experimental results of flux and activity measurements showed good agreement with the results of calculations. Volume of activated concrete waste after reactor decommissioning was estimated for particular case of Jozes Stefan Institute TRIGA reactor. It was observed that the clearance levels of some important long-lived isotopes typical for barite concrete (e.g. Ba-133, Ca-41) are not included in the IAEA and EU basic safety standards.

All the samples appeared to be single phase. From XRD data and TEM observations, the diffraction lines matched well with that of pure thorium. phosphate-hydrogenphosphate hydrate (TPHPH), Th-2(PO4)(2)(HPO4) . H2O, which confirmed the preparation of a complete solid solution between pure thorium and uranium (IV) compounds. TGA/DTA experiments showed that samples of thorium-uranium (IV) phosphate-hydrogenphosphate hydrate (TUP-HPH) prepared at 150-160degreesC were monohydrated leading to the proposed formula Th2-x/2Ux/2(PO4)(2)(HPO4) . H2O. The variation of the XRD diagrams versus the heating temperature showed that TUPHPH remained crystallized and single phase from room temperature to 200degreesC. After heating between 200degreesC and 800degreesC, the presence of diphosphate groups in the solid was evidenced. In this range of temperature, the solid was transformed into the low-temperature monoclinic form of thorium-uranium (IV) phosphate-diphosphate (alpha-TUPD). This latter compound finally turned into well-crystallized, homogeneous and single-phase beta-TUPD (orthorhombic form) above 930-950degreesC for x values lower than 2.80. For higher x values, a mixture of beta-TUPD, alpha-Th1-zUzP2O7 and U2-wThwO(PO4)(2) was obtained. By this new chemical route of preparation of beta-TUPD solid solutions, the homogeneity of the samples is significantly improved, especially considering the distribution of thorium and uranium.

This fuel is prepared by powder metallurgy technique using ThO2 and U3O8 powders as the starting material. The densification behaviour of the fuel was evaluated using a high temperature dilatometer in four different atmospheres Ar, Ar-8%H-2, CO2 and air. Air was found to be the best medium for sintering among them. For Ar and Ar-8%H-2 atmospheres, the former gave a slightly higher densification.

J	Chiba, K; Tanaka, S; Yoneoka, T				Chiba, K; Tanaka, S; Yoneoka, T			Desorption of water adsorbed on iron oxide by laser irradiation	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							TRITIUM; SURFACES; PD(111); NO; DECONTAMINATION; PHOTOCHEMISTRY	Desorption of water adsorbed on iron oxide by laser irradiation was studied by means of a time-of-flight (TOF) technique. The wavelength of the laser for desorption was varied from 355 to 600 nm. The energy threshold of the water desorption ranged around 2.0-2.3 eV. Based on the fact that this energy threshold approximately corresponds to the bandgap of Fe2O3, the initial process of water desorption is considered to be the electronic excitation of the iron oxide from the valence band to the conduction band. Analysis of the velocity distribution of the desorbed water suggests that following the electronic excitation of the iron oxide the desorption is caused by both thermal and nonthermal processes. The thermal process is caused by the rise of the surface temperature that occurs after the scattering and de-excitation of the excited electron in the iron oxide. In the case of the laser at lambda = 355 nm, the desorption was mainly caused by the thermal process. On the other hand, in the case of the laser at lambda = 430 nm, the desorption was mainly caused by the nonthermal process. The desorption caused by the nonthermal process is attributed to the transfer of the electron excited in the iron oxide to the adsorbed hydroxyl. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The experiments were performed in a collaboration work between JNC and the Institute of Physics and Power Engineering of Russia to dispose Russian surplus weapons plutonium, focusing on the effect of the introduction of uranium-plutonium mixed-dioxide (MOX) fuel and stainless steel reflector into the current BN-600 core that is comprised of UO2 fuel and blanket. The analysis results agreed well with measured values on most of the nuclear characteristics. The accuracies are comparable to those obtained for the conventional MOX fueled fast reactors. It suggests that the JNC analysis system can analyze accurately nuclear characteristics in uranium fueled cores as well. A significant improvement was achieved on the sodium void reactivity, by employing an ultra fine group cell calculation system. A change in adjoint neutron spectrum mostly contributes to the improvement. A discrepancy of more than 20% was found on the fission rate distribution of U-235 or Pu-239 in stainless steel reflector regions, which cannot be solved by introducing continuous Monte Carlo calculation or different nuclear data sets.

The thermal conductivity of the compact with 10 wt% of uranium particles was higher than that of the compact without uranium particles. After heating beyond 1,408 K, the melting point of the uranium particles, the thermal conductivity increased further. The evaluation model for analyzing such phenomena was developed. The model predicted that once the UO2 compact with uranium particles was exposed to a temperature beyond 1,408 K, the uranium particles should melt and provide interconnecting areas between the UO2 granules and uranium particles, and between other uranium particles. The resulting increase of the thermal conductivity was reasonably expressed by the effect of necks in the compact on the heat conduction.

The MCB code is an extension of MCNP that includes the burnup implementation; it adopts continuous energy cross sections and it evaluates the transmutation trajectories for over 2,400 decaying nuclides. We equipped the MCB code with three different nuclear data libraries: JENDL-3.2, JEF-2.2 and ENDF/B-6.8 processed for temperatures from 300 to 1,800 K. The GT-MHR model studied in this paper is fueled by actinides coming from the Light Water Reactors waste, converted into two different types of fuel: Driver Fuel and Transmutation Fuel. The Driver Fuel supplies the fissile nuclides needed to maintain the criticality of the reactor, whereas the Transmutation Fuel depletes non-fissile isotopes and controls reactivity excess. We set the refueling and shuffling period to one year and the in-core fuel residency time to three years. The comparative analysis of the MCB code consists of accuracy and precision studies. In the accuracy studies, we performed the burnup calculation with different nuclear data libraries during the year at which the refueling and shuffling schedule set the equilibrium of the fuel composition. In the precision studies, we repeated the same simulations 20 times with a different pseudorandom number stride and the same nuclear data library.

J	Huang, WH; Chen, WC				Huang, WH; Chen, WC			Swelling behavior of a potential buffer material under simulated near field environment	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						swelling; buffer material; nearfield; deep geological repository	RADIOACTIVE-WASTE; CLAY; HEAT	Swelling behavior is an important property in achieving the low-permeability sealing function of buffer material. In this study, free swelling tests were conducted on a potential buffer material under various near field environmental conditions. The potential buffer material used is a locally available clayey material known as Zhisin clay. Experimental results show that Zhisin clay is a temperature sensitive Ca-bentonite. The maximum swelling strain decreases with increasing hydrothermal temperatures due to lattice contraction. Dry heating of Zhisin clay causes reduction in its cation exchange capacity, which in turn results in decreases of swelling strain. The effects of gamma radiation on the physical and chemical properties of Zhisin clay are found to be similar to those of dry heating. The swell of Zhisin clay under simulated underground geochemistry is affected by both the type of electrolyte and the concentration of solution.

An independent VV support structure with multiple flexible plates located at the bottom of VV lower port is proposed as a new concept, which is deferent from the current design, i.e., the VV support is directly connected to the toroidal coils (TF coils). This independent concept has two advantages comparing to the current one: (1) thermal load due to the temperature deference between VV and TF coils becomes lower and (2) the TF coils are categorized as non-safety components because of its independence from VV. Stress Analyses have been performed to assess the integrity of the VV support structure using a precisely modeled VV structure. As a result, (1) the maximum displacement of the VV corresponding to the relative displacement between VV and TF coils is found to be 15 mm, much less than the current design clearance of 100 mm, and (2) the stresses of the whole VV system including VV support are estimated to be less than the allowable ones defined by ASME Section III Subsection NF, respectively. Based on these assessments, the feasibility of the proposed independent VV support has been verified as a VV support.

J	Hodgson, SA; Ham, GJ; Youngman, MJ; Etherington, G; Stradling, GN				Hodgson, SA; Ham, GJ; Youngman, MJ; Etherington, G; Stradling, GN			A review of measurements of radionuclides in members of the public in the UK	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Review							HUMAN TEETH; FALL-OUT; HUMAN BONE; CAESIUM-137; RETENTION; STRONTIUM-90; RADIOCESIUM; PLUTONIUM; BIOASSAY; SCOTLAND	This paper summarises a comprehensive review of radio-analytical data from autopsy, whole or partial body monitoring and the assay of teeth, foetuses and urine for non-occupationally exposed members of the public in the UK between 1957 and 2003. Most attention has been given to measurements of artificial radionuclides formed in the nuclear fuel cycle, uranium and thorium. The review concentrates on measurements on people in the UK who live or have lived in the vicinity of nuclear power sites. When UK data are unavailable, or for the purposes of comparison, information has been included from studies in other countries. Highlights of key findings of the document are listed: The concentrations of strontium-90 in bone and teeth have reflected changes in the amounts present in the environment due to fallout from nuclear testing. There are higher concentration levels of (239+240)Pu in samples from West Cumbria compared with the rest of the UK. However, the levels are so low that any increase in risk of induced skeletal tumours (including leukaemia) would be very small compared with those arising from the intake of natural radionuclides. As expected there have been only a few published autopsy studies. Both tissue sample mass and radionuclide concentrations were low, leading to relatively large measurement uncertainties. Whole body measurements of (137)Cs in residents in Berkshire and Oxfordshire clearly show the effect of atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons and of the Chernobyl accident. A survey of whole body (117)Cs and (134)Cs content following the Chernobyl accident showed that residents of Central Scotland, North-West England and North Wales had twice the radiocaesium content of residents in the rest of England and Wales. Measurements of (131)I in the thyroid have been reported following the accidents at Windscale and Chernobyl for most regions of the UK. Few excretion studies have been reported although this does not diminish their importance. One study on the urinary excretion rate of (90)Sr in adults and children living in the Dounreay area suggested that the results did not support this radionuclide as being the cause of increased childhood leukaemia. Similar conclusions were drawn from another study involving the assay of (239)Pu. It is suggested that a national database of measurements made on members of the public should be initiated. The database would provide a means for identifying future trends.

Annual committed effective doses due to U-238 and Th-232 intakes from the ingestion of the studied food materials were evaluated for different age groups of individuals, using the ICRP ingestion dose coefficients. The influence of the U-238 and Th-232 intakes and ages of individuals on the committed effective dose was investigated. Total annual intakes of U-238 and Th-232 for a typical food basket for adult members of the Moroccan population were estimated to be 451 +/- 27 Bq y(-1) and 359 +/- 20 Bq y(-1), corresponding to committed effective doses of (20 +/- 1) x 10(-6) Sv y(-1) and (83 +/- 5) x 10(-6) Sv y(-1), respectively.

J	Morley, RG; Coates, R; Taylor, RH				Morley, RG; Coates, R; Taylor, RH			Discharge reductions - value for money?	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article								Through the Nuclear Liabilities Management Authority White Paper, the UK Government and the Regulators have signalled a commitment to further improving the operation of the regulatory regime and to its operating within the principles of proportionality, transparency, consistency and accountability which underpin the Government's approach to regulation in general. Particular emphasis is placed upon ensuring that there is greater consistency in the treatment of risk and hazard; proportionate and cost effective delivery of public, worker and environmental protection; and an open and transparently applied regulatory system. The paper uses the historical record of radioactive discharges from BNFL's Sellafield reprocessing site in the UK and seeks to identify what have been the key drivers for change, particularly over the past 20 years of significant discharge reductions. The paper examines the current context for ongoing and future discharges from the site, and the incorporation of the use of the concepts of best practicable environmental option and best practicable means. Intergovernmental commitments such as the OSPAR Sintra and Bremen statements and the developing UK policy framework are also considered, together with BNFL's work with a wide range of 'green' stakeholders. The paper outlines the principal components of BNFL's decision-making processes for discharge control and abatement; and how these interact with the relevant external pressures. It then analyses whether the overall drivers and outcomes align with the declared desire of the UK Government to ensure that the taxpayer receives value for money in the new national arrangements for managing historic nuclear liabilities.
