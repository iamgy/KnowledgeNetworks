The radiation characteristics of sodium as a first-loop coolant in a fast nuclear reactor are presented. An assessment is made of the consequences of sodium burning in various situations. First and foremost, an unanticipated accident with burning of sodium in the first loop adopted in the BN-800 design, is examined. Next, situations with hypothetical scenarios are examined to obtain the limiting data charcterizing the potential fire hazard of radioactive sodium coolant. Specifically, a hypothetical situation where all of the sodium contained in the first loop of the reactor burns is examined. The computational results are analyzed from the standpoint of the role sodium plays in the overall problem of nuclear power plant safety.

This requires a core breeding ratio 1.05-1.08. Such values can be achieved by using technologically perfected and tested oxide fuel with its volume fraction in the core increased to 55-60%. The results of computational-theoretical studies on the selection and optimization of cores with high fuel fractions for BN-1600 and BN-800 reactors are presented in this article. It is shown that such cores can be built in principle.

The kinematic characteristics of the displacement of sodium during the interaction are estimated on the basis of two methods used simultaneously. The first method is based on measuring the residual flexure strain of precalibrated plate-shaped components, which are located above the sodium level, in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the interaction chamber In the second method, the sodium consumption is measured in a pipe which bypasses the interaction chamber The data obtained are used to calculate the work of irreversible adiabatic compression of gas (argon) in the cavity of the bypass pipe conduit. The conversion ratios for the conversion of the thermal energy of the melt into the work of expansion of the system are 5(.)10(-3)-10(-2)%. The two methods are shown to agree satisfactorily with one another A model of the thermal interaction of the melt with sodium is proposed on the basis of the experimental results and correlation of existing data.

The effect of alpha particles is simulated by similar to1 MeV fast He-3 minority heating produced by ion cyclotron resonance heating (20 MW). Thanks to the high-density values (approximate to4 x 10(20) m(-3)), the FT3 plasmas are characterized by short electron-ion equipartition time (60 ms in the ELMy H-mode scenario) and slowing-down time (44 ms), with respect to the energy confinement time of similar to340 ms, a feature characteristic of BP experiments but not always satisfied with present tokamak devices. Advanced scenarios at 5 T with fully non-inductive current drive can be investigated with a steady-state current density profile achieved in <5 s. The aim of FT3 is to prepare ITER operation and to provide a test bed for the development of the ITER auxiliary system and diagnostics. Elements of the scientific program are as follows: the investigation of energetic particle collective effects, optimization of H-mode scenarios, development of improved H-mode scenarios and scenarios with ITBs, magnetohydrodynamic and transport studies in ITER-relevant conditions, and study of edge plasma dynamics. FT3 can use all the existing facilities available in Frascati and could be constructed in similar to5 yr.

J	Milacic, S				Milacic, S			Changes in leukocytes caused by tritium contamination	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						tritium; biological indicators; exposure; population; chromosome aberration	LYMPHOCYTES; BLOOD	Tritium is a radionuclide uniformly absorbed by the body. The purpose of cytomorphological and cytochemical leukocytes examination in tritium-affected workers was early detection of initial health disorder caused by tritium contamination. Cytoplasm and nuclear morphological changes were analyzed by colored blood smear microscopy. The enzyme activity (APL, MPO) in granulocytes was examined by cytochemical methods. Morphological changes were found in 47.17% of the subjects (N = 53) and in 2% (N = 52) of the controls. Chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes were found in 49.05% of the exposed workers and in 2% of the controls. The granulocytes enzyme activities were significantly diminished in the exposed workers (p less than or equal to 0.001). The average level of beta radiation found in the urine of those affected by tritium was 3.46 kBq L-1, while it was significantly lower in the others: 0.35 kBq L-1. The enzyme activity decreases after 5 y of tritium exposure. Nuclear and cytoplasm changes as well as lowered enzyme activity in granulocytes were found in tritium-contaminated workers. Interdependence of cytomorphological and cytochemical changes was established. There was no correlation between cytochemical changes and granulocytes count.

In developing countries, thousands of radium needles, teletherapy sources, oil well logging neutron sources, and miscellaneous industrial radioactive gauges are annually collected as waste and stored in research institutes. The objectives of the study described in this paper are to inventory such sources in Brazil, including those presently in use and those already collected as waste, and to design a dedicated repository where spent sources could be disposed of properly. The inventory of sources in Brazil and the concept of the repository are presented and its feasibility is discussed.

J	El-Bahi, SM				El-Bahi, SM			Assessment of radioactivity and radon exhalation rate in Egyptian cement	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						naturally occurring radionuclides; exhalation rate; detector; radiation; radon	PLASTIC TRACK DETECTOR; CALIBRATION	The cement industry is considered as one of the basic industries that plays an important role in the national economy of developing countries. Activity concentration of U-238, Th-232, and (40) K in local cement types from different Egyptian factories has been measured using a shielded HPGe detector. The average values obtained for U-238, Th-232, and K-40 activity concentrations in different types of cement are lower than the corresponding global values reported in UNSCEAR publications. On the basis of the hazard index and the radium equivalent concentration, it can be shown that the natural radioactivity of cement samples is not greater than the values permitted in the established standards in other countries. A solid-state nuclear track detector SSNTD (Cr-39) was used to measure the radon concentration as well as exhalation rate for these samples. The effective radium content and the exhalation rate are found to vary from 12.75 to 38.52 Bq kg(-1) and 61.19 to 181.39 Bq m(-2) d(-1), respectively.

No dependence of the ratio Pu(feces)/Pu(urine) on plutonium aerosol transportability, sex, and age of workers was revealed in the late times after the end of occupational exposure. It was found that at the late times after the end of occupational exposure, the ratio of feces/urine is characterized by the lognormal distribution with the median value, 0.57, and error for this index characterized geometric deviation, sigma(g) = 1.12. Urinary and fecal excretions were analyzed after chronic exposure to inhaled plutonium compounds of different transportability for another group of 345 workers. During 500-16,000 d after the started chronic inhalation, plutonium biokinetic model ("Doses-2000") used in Southern Ural Biophysics Institute (SUBI) and based on the ICRP Publication 66 overestimated the feces/urine ratio by an order of magnitude as compared with the observed values. It indicates a necessity for further improvement of the biokinetic model used in SUBI.

J	Norris, MJ; Guiseppe, VE; Hess, CT				Norris, MJ; Guiseppe, VE; Hess, CT			Waterborne radon in seven maine schools	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						radon; water; radioactivity; airborne; environmental assessment	EXPOSURES	This study investigated the transfer coefficient of radon from water to air in kitchens and bathrooms for seven schools located in Maine. Simulations occurred in water use rooms containing multiple airborne radon detectors. Quantities measured included radon concentration in water (10-960 Bq L-1, 260-26,000 pCi L-1), air (0-3 Bq L-1, 0-80 pCi L-1), volume of water used, emissivities (0.04-0.98), and ventilation rates (0.012-0.066 min(-1)). Using these parameters provides the means for calculating the transfer coefficient and by which dose due to waterborne radon can be estimated in other schools. Transfer coefficient values calculated for kitchens and baths ranged from 9.6 x 10(-6) to 2.0 x 10(-2). Multiple detectors showed that the radon concentration varied throughout a room. These measurements represent the first of this type to be done in schools in Maine.

J	Guo, ST; Ziemer, PL				Guo, ST; Ziemer, PL			Health physics aspects of neutron activated components in a linear accelerator	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article							MEDICAL ACCELERATOR; X-RAY; SPECTRA	The purpose of this study was to investigate the residual radioactivity in the therapy accessories of a medical x ray linear accelerator. The residual radioactivity mainly originated from nuclear activation reactions by neutrons, which are present as a contamination radiation in the x-ray beam. The radiation used in this study was the 25 MV x-ray beam produced by a CGR Saturne III linear accelerator. The five treatment aids include four wedges of various angles and one cerrobend block. The decrease in dose rates with time was followed for 60 min for each or the five treatment aids immediately after 999 monitor units of irradiation. The integral doses from the surface of each of four activated therapy accessories following three different radiation doses were measured by using thermoluminescent dosimeters (CaF2). In the TLD measurement, polyethylene fliters were used to differentiate beta(-) or beta(+) particles from the mixed decay radiation. A high-purity germanium detection system was utilized to collect and to analyze the gamma spectra from the activated therapy accessories. The residual radioisotopes found in the 15degrees wedge and 30degrees wedge included V-52, Cr-49, Cr-51, Mn-56, Fe-53, Co-61, and Ni-57. In the 45degrees and 60degrees wedges, the radionuclides identified were Co-61, Ni-57, Cu-62, and W-187. The principal nuclides identified in the irradiated cerrobend block were In-111m, Sn-111, Cd-105, Pb-203. The corresponding nuclear reactions from which the residual radionuclides produced were confirmed by consulting the current literature.

Simple approaches are needed to create test surfaces in order to quantify contaminant removal or "decon" methods. We used steel discs sized to allow direct and accarate alpha counting in a Ludlum scanner from radioactive contaminants. A typical 3.8-cm-diameter coupon had a depleted uranyl loading of about 0.1 mg U cm(-2) with a count of 980 dpm. The residting alpha radiation was measured with a precision of >97% for the same coupon. The alpha concentration on replicate coupons differed by as much as 9% (standard deviation). This method, based on earlier methods, required a uranyl solution to be dried but lowers the baking temperature to less than 100 degreesC to increase safety in a typical radiological laboratory. A dike was used to provide a uniform coating of the uranyl solution.

As a consequence, many healthcare facilities are cited each year for losing control and/or improperly disposing of RAM at unauthorized disposal sites. Healthcare radiation safety professionals must ensure that effective measures are in place at their facilities to prevent RAM from inadvertently being included with non-radioactive waste shipments. The objective or this article is to assist in developing and implementing procedures to properly monitor and dispose of waste containing RAM. This article discusses, among other topics, the installation of portal monitors containing both visual and audible alarms to screen medical waste, instruction to individuals handling medical waste and emergency response procedures.

J	Strzelczyk, J; Safadi, R				Strzelczyk, J; Safadi, R			Radiation safety considerations in GliaSite I-125 brain implant procedures	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topic; cancer; safety standards; I-125	BRACHYTHERAPY; PATTERNS	The traditional approach to treatment of certain malignant brain tumors involves permanent implantation of I-125 seeds sequential to tumor's resection. This approach has recently been changed for patients with unifocal recurrent gliomas. What began during the 1990's as a large clinical trial utilizing GliaSite Radiotherapy System, is currently becoming standard of care. This radiotherapy system consists of an inflatable balloon catheter, 2, 3, or 4 cm diameter, which is surgically placed in the tumor resection cavity; its positioning and the level of conformity within the cavity tire verified via MRI imaging with contrast. The balloon is then filled with appropriate volume of I-125 in the liquid form. Radiation treatment prescription (lose ranges from 40 to 60 Gy (4,000 to 6,000 rads). This is accomplished by allowing 2.77 to 16.6 GBq (75 to 450 mCi) of I-125 to remain in the balloon for 3-5 d. Numerous technical, dosimetric, and logistical considerations arise when handling large quantities of iodine necessary to perform GliaSite procedures. They require coordination of efforts of several hospital departments and the institution's RSO-in our case, two RSOs, at the University of Colorado Hospital and University of Colorado Health Sciences Center hold separate radioactive materials licenses. Based on our experiences and those of others, we conclude that, with appropriate guidance and care, these procedures can be performed safely without excessive restrictions.

Fission gas release rates were about 3.3% and 5.2%, and swelling rates were about 1.8% and 1.6%/% FIMA. From the radial distributions of Xe concentration measured by EPMA, it was determined that approximately 80% and 15% of fission gases were retained in the intragranular region and in the fission gas bubbles, respectively. Deformation of the fuel cladding differed between the two tested fuel pins. A uniform diameter increase was observed in the small gap fuel pin, while ovalities, which seemed to be caused by relocation of the fuel fragments, were found in the large gap one.

UO2 disks have been implanted with 1 MeV He-3 ions at a fluence of 1 x 10(16) He-3 cm(-2) using a Van der Graaff accelerator. These implantation conditions lead to a local helium concentration of 0.2 at.% at a depth of 1.9 mum in UO2. The 3He(d,alpha)H-1 Nuclear Reaction Analysis method was used to determine the helium depth profile after the various annealing stages. The experimental results measured after 1100 degreesC anneal were analysed using a simple model which satisfactorily reproduces the observed helium depth profile changes. The intragranular helium diffusion coefficient is estimated and the result is assessed against other data published in the open literature. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two different matrices, a soda borosilicate glass and a lead silicate glass, are proposed for encapsulating lanthanum and gadolinium zirconates having pyrochlore crystalline structure. The fabrication of the composites involves powder mixing followed by cold pressing and pressureless sintering or hot-pressing at relatively low temperatures (<620 degreesC). The hot-pressing route is found to be the most convenient, since it leads to relatively high densification even with substantial loading of pyrochlore phase (40 vol.%). The absence of microcracks, due to the close matching of thermal expansion coefficients of the composite constituents, together with the strong pyrochlore particle/glass matrix interfacial bonding, suggests that the composites have good mechanical properties. The innovative introduction of gadolinium zirconate in a lead silicate matrix represents an attractive approach, since the composites reach reasonably high densities both by pressureless sintering and hot-pressing.

To accurate profile measurements, the cross-section of the He-3(d, p)He-4 nuclear reaction was carefully measured with a relative standard deviation of 5%. The total cross-section represented by a fit function is compared with data from literature. With the described coincidence arrangement, we obtained a reduction by a factor approximate to4 x 10(4) of the signal of deuterons elastically scattered in uranium and a total suppression of parasite signals in the region of helium profiling. This technique enables us to measure helium profile in UO2 a couple of microns below the surface with a resolution of 0.1 mum and a detection limit of 0.01 at.%. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The solidification matrix was a standard Portland cement mixed with 290-350 kg/m(3) spent cation exchange resins, with or without 2-5% of bentonite clay. The leach rates from the cement-bentonite matrix as Co-60: (4.2-7.3) x 10(-5) cm/d, and for Cs-137: (3.2-6.6) x 10-5 cm/d, after 245 days were measured. From the leaching data the apparent diffusivity of cobalt and cesium in cement-bentonite clay matrix with a waste load of 290-350 kg/m(3) spent cation exchange resins was measured as Co-60: (1.0-4.0) x 10(-6) cm(2)/d and for Cs-137: (0.5-2.6) x 10(-4) cm(2)/d after 245 days. These results are part of a 20-year mortar and concrete testing project which will influence the design of radioactive waste management for a future Serbian radioactive waste disposal center.

This study investigates the corrosion of nickel in molten LiCl-10 wt% Li2O at 750 degreesC by immersion experiments, with the aim of unraveling the corrosion behavior. Nickel corrodes very fast in the melt, forming a layer of NiO, which is converted to Li2Ni8O10 and then to LiNiO2. The weight loss curve shows a linear rate law, which is owing to the harmful reaction between oxides and melt at the melt/scale boundary with the formation of the porous corrosion scale. The corrosion mechanism of nickel is also discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Fukada, S				Fukada, S			Tritium isotope separation by water distillation column packed with silica-gel beads	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						tritiated water; distillation; silica gel; adsorption; enrichment; decontamination; hydrogen isotope separation	DETRITIATION; SYSTEMS; DESIGN; SCALE; ITER	Tritium enrichment or depletion by water distillation was investigated using a glass column of 32 cm in height packed with silica-gel beads of 3.4 mm in average diameter. The total separation factor of the silica-gel distillation column, alpha(H-T), was compared with those of an open column distillation tower and of a column packed with stainless-steel Dixon rings. Depletion of the tritium activity in the distillate was enhanced by isotopic exchange with water adsorbed on silica-gel beads that have a higher affinity for HTO than for H2O. The value of alpha(H-T)-1 of the silica-gel distillation column was about four times larger than that of a column without any packing and about two times larger than that of the Dixon-ring column. The improvement of alpha(H-T) by the silica-gel adsorbent indicated that the height of the distillation-adsorption column becomes shorter than that of the height of conventional distillation columns.

The values obtained using the different models and codes are in a good agreement for all targets except uranium. The comparison with the available experimental data for the heat deposition for 0.8, 1.0 and 1.2 GeV protons has been performed. The good agreement is observed for copper, lead and bismuth target. The best result is obtained with the help of the ISABEL model. The systematic dependence of the heat deposition from atomic number of the target was investigated. The contribution of different particles and energy ranges in the heat deposition has been studied at the primary proton energies from 0.3 to 2.5 GeV.

Here is a preliminary application of this methodology to evaluate the Fixed and Fluidized Bed Nuclear Reactor Concept (FBNR). The FBNR is based on pressurized light water reactor technology. It is a small, modular, and integrated primary circuit reactor. It is an inherently safe and passively cooled reactor concept. FBNR in its first phase of development is a fixed bed nuclear reactor and in its next phase will be a fluidized bed nuclear reactor. FBNR in its advanced versions can use supercritical steam or helium gas as coolant, and utilize MOX or thorium fuel.

The system is composed of high intensity proton accelerator, lead-bismuth spallation target and lead-bismuth cooled subcritical core with nitride fuel. About 2500 kg of minor actinide is loaded into the subcritical core. Annual transmutation amount using this system is 250 kg with 800 MW of thermal output. This transmutation amount corresponds to the amount of minor actinides produced from 10 units of 1GWe power reactors annually. A superconducting linear accelerator with the beam power of 20-30MW is connected to drive the subcritical core. To maximize the transmutation efficiency, the nitride fuel without uranium, such as (Np, Am, Pu)N, is selected. The nitride fuel irradiated in the ADS is reprocessed by pyrochemical process followed by the re-fabrication of nitride fuel. Many research and development activities are under way and planned in the fields of subcritical core design, spallation target technology, lead-bismuth handling technology, accelerator development, and minor actinide fuel development. Especially, to study and evaluate the feasibility of the ADS from physics and engineering aspects, the transmutation experimental facility (TEF) is proposed under a framework of the High-lntensity Proton Accelerator Project.

During transmutation, dangerous nuclides, first of all, Cm-244 and Pu-238 are accumulated. They cause an increase of radiotoxicity. At first 10 cycles of transmutation, the radiotoxicity is increased by 8.7 times in comparison with radiotoxicity of initial load of transmuted actinides. Heavy-water reactor with thermal power of 1000 MW can transmute neptunium, americium and curium extracted from 3.7 VVER-1000 type reactors. It means, that the required power of transmutation reactor makes about 8% of thermal power of VVER-1000 type reactors. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The key merit is the capability to differentiate nuclear recoil (nr) signatures from the background beta/gamma-events due to ambient radioactivity on the basis of their different pulse shapes. One of the major experimental challenges is to perform such pulse shape analysis in the statistics-limited domain where the light output is close to the detection threshold. Using data derived from measurements with low-energy gamma's and nuclear recoils due to neutron elastic scatterings, it was verified that the pulse shapes between beta/gamma-events are different. Several methods of pulse shape discrimination (PSD) are studied, and their relative merits are compared. Full digitization of the pulse shapes is crucial to achieve good discrimination. Advanced software techniques with mean time, neural network and likelihood ratios give rise to satisfactory performance, and are superior to the conventional Double Charge method commonly applied at higher energies. PSD becomes effective starting at a light yield of about 20 photo-electrons. This corresponds to a detection threshold of about 5 keV electron-equivalence energy, or 40-50 keV recoil kinetic energy, in realistic experiments. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A parametric study of the critical mass of enriched uranium, plutonium, and neptunium is examined and tabulated. The results obtained expand on the understanding of reflector moderated critical systems, and they show regions of unstable criticality for U-235 and Pu-239 reflected cores at intermediate densities. This instability is illustrated by calculations of the positive reactivity coefficient of volume expansion. The coefficient is positive, not negative, in the intermediate density region for U-235 and Pu-239 systems. For Np-237 cores reflected by the same moderator, the effect is negligible. The critical dimensions were calculated with the DANTSYS codes using the Hansen-Roach cross-section libraries. This study is both a summary of mostly unpublished calculations and new calculations. Experimental data for these configurations are extremely limited. These are examined in the text when applicable.

J	Icenhour, AS; Toth, LM				Icenhour, AS; Toth, LM			Behavior of uranium oxides and oxyfluorides exposed to moisture and Cm-244 alpha radiation	RADIATION EFFECTS AND DEFECTS IN SOLIDS			English	Article						alpha radiolysis; uranium oxides; uranium oxyfluorides	RADIOLYSIS; PEROXIDE; WATER	Alpha radiolysis studies have been performed on uranium oxides and oxyfluorides (UO3, U3O8, and UO2F2) to evaluate the long-term storage characteristics of U-233. These uranium compounds (using U-238 as the surrogate for U-233) were subjected to relatively high alpha radiation doses (235-634 MGy) by doping with Cm-244. The typical irradiation time for these samples was about 1.5 years, which would be equivalent to more than 50 years irradiation by a U-233 sample. Both dry and wet (up to 10 wt% water) samples were examined in an effort to identify the gas pressure and composition changes that occurred as a result of radiolysis. This study shows that several competing reactions occur during radiolysis with the net effect of generating only very low pressures of hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide from water, nitrate, and carbon impurities, respectively. In the absence of nitrate impurities, no pressures greater than 1000 Torr are generated. Usually, however, the oxygen in the air atmosphere over the oxides is consumed with the corresponding oxidation of the uranium oxide. In the presence of up to 10 wt% water, the oxides first show a small pressure rise followed by a net decrease due to the oxygen consumption and the attainment of a steady-state pressure at which the rate of generation of gaseous components is balanced by their recombination and/or consumption in the oxide phase.

In this paper, we discuss different (242m) Am enrichments, as well as fuel weight requirements, to produce a critical reactor. It was found that relatively low enrichments of (242m) Am, about 10 w/o, are enough to guarantee criticality. Such low enrichments might eliminate the need for a (242m) Am enrichment process. It was also found that the best results for low (242m) Am requirements are obtained with a moderator to fuel volume ratio of 10,000. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By applying the method, the escape energy from the tungsten absorber with sealed Ir-192 source in it was measured. The ion chamber-type detector was used to measure the air kerma rates due to the escape photons. From the energy spectrum obtained by means of HPGe spectrometry, the effective mass energy-absorption coefficient in air for the escape photons was evaluated. The proposed method can be used for any other radioactive sources. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Computer codes PORU and SORU were developed to calculate the total neutron cross-section and neutron transmission through poly and mono-crystalline uranium respectively. The obtained agreement between the calculated total cross-sections of poly-crystalline uranium in the energy range from 4 meV to 1 eV and the available experimental values justifies the applicability of the used formula and the computer code. A feasibility study on using depleted uranium single crystal as a thermal neutron filter is also given. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The errors of gamma-activational analysis of uranium and thorium are much lower than the errors of the gamma-spectrometric method. The results of independent instrumentational methods agree within the error limits due to the counting statistics with P = 0.95. It is best to combine these methods for radioecological examinations of regions with natural and technogenic anomalies of uranium and thorium and their decay products and for assessing the degree of departure from radiactive equilibrium in the uranium or thorium decay chains. These methods can supplement the neutron-activational and x-ray fluorescence methods used for composition cerification of standard samples of soil, rocks, and other natural objects.

J	Thomauske, B				Thomauske, B			Approaches to the final storage of radioactive waste in the Federal Republic of Germany. Will responsibility be shifted to future generations?	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								With respect to the management of high-level radioactive waste in Germany, there is agreement on these premises: - The waste is to be stored permanently in the Federal Republic of Germany. - A repository is to be operational by 2030. - Final storage is to be achieved in geologic formations. Differences of opinion exist about these questions: Should there be only one repository for all types of radioactive waste, or would a breakdown into waste generating heat and waste generating only negligible amounts of heat in different repositories be useful under aspects of safety and requirement? - Will a new site selection procedure be required in an effort to find a suitable site, and would such a selection procedure be able to meet the deadline of 2030 for an operational repository? - After the end of legal proceedings, should the Konrad repository be revamped for waste generating negligible amounts of heat? The analysis presented shows that an operational repository for waste generating heat can be made available only in connection with continued exploration work at Gorleben and demonstration of the suitability of that site and subsequent construction of the repository. If the search for a repository site were started from scratch, the date of commissioning such a facility would be after 2050. In this way, that approach would miss the purpose of not shifting the waste management issue to future generations. Acting responsibly means to build the Konrad repository speedily after completion of the legal proceedings about a permit and, in this way, avoid the addition of more interim stores for waste generating negligible amounts of heat. Further exploration of Gorleben is the way agreed upon and necessary for the creation of a repository for high-level radioactive waste generating heat by 2030. For this purpose, the "points of doubt" must be resolved speedily.

Waste arisings and availability of a repository as seen by an electricity utility	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								The management of waste arising in the operation of nuclear power plants has been taken into account since the beginnings of the peaceful uses of nuclear power in Germany. As early as in 1957, a memorandum of the German Advisory Committee on Atomic Energy contains a reference to the need for safe disposal of radioactive waste. Legislation adopted the suggestion and laid down some provisions on the safe utilization of radioactive materials as early as in the Atomic Energy Act of December 23, 1959. In connection with the nuclear waste management center, the Federal Republic also looked for a suitable site for a repository. After thorough site selection proceedings by the federal government and the state of Lower Saxony, the Lower Saxony state government in 1977 defined Gorleben as the site. The decision had been preceded by a three-stage selection process in which more than 140 sites had been investigated. Exploration of the Gorleben site began in 1979 and was interrupted on October 1, 2000 to clarify conceptual and safety-related doubts of the federal government. The German Federal Ministry for the Environment (BMU) seeks to make a repository (for high-level waste) available in 2030. Technically, it is still possible to commission a repository for waste generating heat at Gorleben after 2025 if the salt dome is found to be suitable after speedy conclusion of the exploration work. Reference is made to foreseeable problem areas. Another project pursued by the federal government is the use of the Konrad mine as a repository for low and medium-level radioactive waste. After well over twenty years, the plans approval decision was made in May 2002 and is at present the subject of litigation. On the basis of the data presented about the expected arisings of waste generating no heat in combination with the possible start of emplacement in Konrad in 2013, detailed results are presented.
