J	Renaud, P; Louvat, D				Renaud, P; Louvat, D			Magnitude of fission product depositions from atmospheric nuclear weapon test fallout in France	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						nuclear weapons; fallout; radioactivity; environmental; fission products	GLOBAL FALLOUT; PU-238; CESIUM	The external dose attributable to fallout from worldwide atmospheric nuclear testing, which represents about 40% of the total effective dose received before 2000, is dominated by specific fission products such as Zr-95, Ba-140, Ru-106, Ru-103, and Ce-144, which are far less well-documented than Sr-90 and Cs-137. The depositions of these nuclides over France were calculated on the basis of activity measurements in air and rainwater samples collected from 1961 to 1977. These depositions were then compared to the same radionuclides activities measured in grass during that period. This study shows that the transfer and deposition processes occur in a very similar manner for all the studied radionuclides. Depositions calculated in this study, consistent in most cases with UNSCEAR estimates, constitute a good basis for the external dose assessment of nuclear weapon test fallout over Western Europe.

It was applied to a sliced lung phantom that had activity homogeneously distributed throughout the tissue substitute material and to laminated planar sources in an attempt to answer three questions: 1) Was the activity distribution the same in each slice of the sliced homogeneous lung set? 2) Was the activity distribution the same for each of the laminated planar sources? and 3) Were the activity distributions the same between slices and planar sources? The activity distribution, including identification of some locations of elevated activity in the sliced homogeneous lungs, was easily obtained using autoradiography. This study demonstrates that neither the sliced homogeneous lung sets nor the laminated planar sources had a homogeneous distribution of radioactivity, as had been previously thought.

Radioactivity levels of U-238 and Th-232 in imported mineral water were checked from the viewpoint of internal radiation for Japanese subjects. Concentration ranges of U-238 and Th-232 in imported bottled mineral water, domestic bottled mineral water, domestic tap water, and domestic soft drinks were as follows: for U-238, N.D to 7.48 x 10(3), 1.07 to 344, 0.66 to 104, and 3.04 to 46.2 ng dm(-3) (ppt); for Th-232, 0.60 to 5.12, 0.65 to 22.4, 0.64 to 22.1, and 11.0 to 48.5 ng dm(-3), respectively. In some brands of imported bottled mineral water, U-238 concentration was sometimes much higher than domestic bottled mineral water and domestic tap water. The annual effective dose (1.5 x 10(-3) mSv y(-1)) esti- mated from intake of U-238 was approximately 7 times higher than that through dietary intake in Japanese. However, the internal dose added by drinking the imported portable water is negligible compared with total annual internal dose. Concentrations of non-radioactive elements were also compared between imported and domestic bottled water. Geometric means of cobalt, arsenic, strontium, cesium, phosphorous, and calcium in imported bottled water were higher compared with those of domestic bottled mineral water and domestic tap water. Maximum values of 11 elements (arsenic, rubidium, strontium, cesium, barium, sodium, magnesium, potassium, calcium, and manganese) were also found in imported bottled water.

The measured concentrations were subsequently used to calculate the equilibrium factor between radon and its progeny. The results obtained indicate that various locations underground have different values of radon concentration and ratios of radon concentration to its progeny concentration. The differences can be ascribed to variations in grades of uranium at different locations and to some environmental factors such as ventilation, particle concentration, and the deposition of the progeny on surfaces or on the atmospheric aerosol.

A total of 70 samples of commonly used building materials were collected from various manufacturers and suppliers throughout the country and analyzed using a HPGe gamma ray spectrometer. The specific activities of Ra-226, Th-232, and K-40 were measured in all samples, and results ranged from minimum values of < 1, < 1, and 4 Bq kg(-1) to maximum values of 139, 57, and 1,977 Bq kg-1, with mean values of 32, 18, and 353 Bq kg(-1), respectively. Results obtained were compared with relevant national, EU , and international legislation and guidance, and with the results of similar studies undertaken in other countries. These activities would suggest that the use of such building materials in the construction of domestic dwellings or workplaces in Ireland is unlikely to give rise to any significant radiation exposure to the occupants. In general, these activities were comparable to the results of similar studies undertaken in other countries. Cs-137 activity was also detected in some samples.

J	Fukui, M				Fukui, M			Twenty years of experience in monitoring Ar-41 in a research reactor and decrease of its discharge into the environment	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						reactor, nuclear; emissions, atmospheric; radioactivity, airborne; environmental impact		The radioactive gas Ar-41 has been produced at high concentration by neutron activation near the reactor core in the Kyoto University Research Reactor. A pipe line for an exhaust stream, so-called sweep gas, was fabricated at the construction of the reactor in 1964 in order to exhale Ar-41 from the facilities above to the environment. Other exhaust lines with decay tanks were established separately from the sweep line for both the cold neutron source in 1986 and the heavy-water tank in 1996, respectively, because a higher amount of Ar-41 was thought to be produced from these facilities due to the improvement. As a result, a slight change in the flow rate of the exhaust was found to have a great deal of influence on both the Ar-41 concentration in the reactor room and the rate of emission from the stack. By monitoring the exhaust air from the decay tanks, the mechanism for decreasing the emission was clarified together with identifying an obstacle, i.e., the condensate against the steady state flow, formed in the exhaust pipe. By setting the flow rate suitably in the exhaust line, the rate of Ar-41 emission from the biological shielding into both the work place in the reactor room and the environment has been controlled as low as reasonably achievable.

The testing was conducted to determine whether sampling system locations would meet the criteria for uniform air velocity and contaminant concentration in the American National Standard Institute standard, Sampling and Monitoring Releases of Airborne Radioactive Substances from the Stacks and Ducts of Nuclear Facilities (ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999). The standard is a revision of the 1969 version that the facilities have been required to meet. Whereas the 1969 standard provided prescriptive criteria for the selection of sampling locations, the 1999 standard is performance-based and requires well-mixed sampling locations that must be demonstrated through performance tests that are specified in the standard. Testing at the Life Sciences Laboratory I was performed on the existing stack at the current sampling location; a scale model was built and used in place of the Radiochemical Processing Laboratory. Although both facilities' sampling sites were compliant with the 1969 standard, only the Radiochemical Processing Laboratory met the criteria of the revised standard. In the future, the use of a computational fluid dynamics computer model may be useful in determining whether a sampling location is likely to test successfully.

The inspection and cleaning was performed to evaluate effective methods and potential cost impacts of maintenance requirements in the revised American National Standard Institute standard Sampling and Monitoring Releases of Airborne Radioactive Substances from the Stacks and Ducts of Nuclear Facilities. The standard requires at least annual inspections of sampling systems followed by cleaning if deposits are visible. During 2001 and 2002, inspections were performed leaving the sampling systems in place and inserting videoscope cables into different access points to allow viewing of the inside and outside of sampling manifolds and transport lines. Cleaning was performed on one of the systems by disconnecting and extracting the sampling manifold, then washing it with de-ionized water and scrub brushes. The wash water was analyzed for radioactivity and solids. Results of the inspection showed greater deposition in one of the systems than would be expected by a High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filtered exhaust stream, possibly due to accumulation of dust from a short period when unfiltered air was exhausted from construction areas. The second system was also downstream of HEPA filters and appeared much cleaner. The videoscope was a useful and cost-effective tool and provided a better view than could be obtained with the naked eye. However, because even small amounts of deposition were made visible with the videoscope, clarification is needed in defining when probe washing is merited, particularly in existing sampling systems whose design is not conducive to easy removal and cleaning.

J	Sunwoo, AJ; Hiromoto, DS				Sunwoo, AJ; Hiromoto, DS			Effects of natural aging on the tensile properties of water-quenched U-6%Nb alloy	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							URANIUM-NIOBIUM; U-NB; PHASES	Uranium-6 wt% niobium (U-6%Nb) alloy has been in use for many years in the water-quenched (WQ) condition. The purpose of this work was to determine the effect of natural aging on tensile properties of the WQ U-6%Nb alloy. The materials studied were hemispherical shells after 15 and 20 years in storage. The alloy was successfully tested in the original curved configuration, using the specially designed tensile test apparatus. Finite element analysis confirmed the validity of the test method. The results of the tensile tests clearly indicated that in the WQ condition, the material is changing and after 15 and 20 years, the yield strength exceeds the original maximum allowable specification. The fracture mode transitions from highly ductile, microvoid coalescence in new material to a mixed mode of shallow dimples and inclusion-induced voids in the naturally aged material.

Starting from end-of-life conditions at various burn-ups, measurements under thermal annealing cycles were performed in order to investigate the recovery of the thermal conductivity as a function of temperature. The separate effects of soluble fission products, of fission gas frozen in dynamical solution and of radiation damage were determined. In this context, particular emphasis was given to the behaviour of samples displaying the high burn-up rim structure. Recovery stages could be thoroughly investigated in samples that were irradiated at low burn-ups and/or at high irradiation temperatures. Other samples, in particular those exhibiting the characteristic rim structure, disintegrated at temperatures slightly higher than the irradiation temperature. Finally, from a database of several thousand measurements, an accurate formula for the in-pile thermal conductivity of UO2 up to 100 GWd t(-1) was developed, taking into account all the relevant effects and structural changes induced by reactor burn-up.

Neutron spectra were measured with the time-of-flight method at ten laboratory angles between 0degrees and 90degrees by using a beam swinger system. Data were obtained down to similar to1 MeV from the highest energy, using a two-gain NE213 detector system. Induced radioactivity of Be-7 was measured by detecting the 478 keV gamma-rays from Be-7 with a pure Ge detector. The experimental results of neutron spectra revealed clearly the entire shape of the neutron emission spectrum and the angular dependence including so called "high energy tail" extending up to similar to40 MeV. The present data at 0degrees are in reasonable agreement with corresponding value by Lone et al. at 23 MeV above similar to5 MeV, but show large discrepancy in the lower energy region. The results of Be-7 production for both nuclei were much larger than expected by the calculation with a recent code IRAC.

The gamma rays Of (CS)-C-134, Cs-137 and Ru-106 were measured on the fuel rods, and consequently compared with the results of the ORIGEN2/82 calculation, in which both the original library and ORLIBJ32 based on the JENDL-3.2 library were used. The effect of pellet radial gamma distribution on self-shielding factor was considered, and cesium radial migration was also discussed using the ratio of gamma ray intensity of Cs-114 to Cs-137. The axial gamma ray measurement and calculation of Cs-134 and Ru-106 agreed within about 20% and Cs-137 agreed within 13% after correction with pellet self-shielding factors. Two types of boundary curves associated with cesium migration were obtained by simple analysis using Cs-134/Cs-137 gamma intensity ratio. The axial neutron emission calculated by ORIGEN2/82 with ORLIBJ32 was generally smaller than the measured ones. The main neutron source in spent fuel is the spontaneous fission Of (CM)-C-244. Small buildup Of 244CM caused the underestimation of neutron emission. The main flow up to Cm-244 is Pu-241, Pu-242, Pu-243, 243 Am and Am-244m. The (n, gamma) cross sections of Am-243 on the main flow and Cm-244 have strong sensitivity on buildup of Cm-244. The re-evaluation of the (n, y) cross sections of these nuclides will improve the prediction for Cm-244 buildup.

The results suggested that the practical difficulties with yield and purity are of a kinetic rather than a thermodynamical nature. We predict that the immediate product of the typical decarburisation step is not methane, but hydrogen cyanide. HCN may then undergo further reactions upon cooling, explaining the difficulty in observing any carbophoric molecules in the gaseous off stream. The thermal stability of nitride fuels in different environments was also estimated. We show that sintering of nitride compounds containing americium should be performed under nitrogen atmosphere in order to the avoid the excessive losses of americium reported from sintering under inert gas. Addition of nitrogen in small amounts to fuel pin filling gas also appears to significantly improve the in-pile stability of transuranium nitride fuels.

Among such experiments were the removal of volatile ruthenium tetroxide from the off-gas, 23-month operation of a bench-scale apparatus and 100-day operation of a pilot plant 115 the size of the actual scale. After evaluation of the results for operability and durability of components under acidic conditions, this process was concluded applicable to an actual plant. Compared to the conventional NOx production method using chemical reaction, it has the great advantage of reducing largely low-level radioactive and non-radioactive sodium nitrate waste. With this conclusion, the procedure to install the process at the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant has been commenced.

The calculated nuclear characteristic parameters were the neutron multiplication factor in infinite media, migration area and diffusion constant for I I kinds of typical fuels encountered in criticality safety evaluation of nuclear fuel cycle facilities. These fuels included ADU-H2O, UF6HF and Pu(NO3)(4)-UO2(NO3)(2) solution, of which data were not cited in the Data Collection. The calculation was made with the Japanese Evaluated Nuclear Data Library JENDL-3.2 and a sequence of criticality calculation codes, SRAC, POST and SIMCRI. The subcriticality judgment graphs that depict the region of the two variables (a) uranium enrichment, Pu-239/Pu ratio or plutonium enrichment and (b) H/(Pu+U) ratio where the neutron multiplication factor in infinite media k(infinity)less than or equal to0.98 were drawn for the same kinds of fuels except UF6-HF. The limitations of the subcriticality judgment graphs were also discussed.

High adsorbtion capacity was observed for thorium by Arthrobacter nicotianae and Micrococcus luteus, and for uranium by Arthrobacter nicotianae. The adsorption of both thorium and uranium by Micrococcus luteus cells was rapid, was affected by the solution pH, and obeyed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm for binary systems in a competitive manner taking the ionic charge of the metal ion into account. The thorium selectivity in the competitive adsorption is assumed to be caused by the faster adsorption and the slower desorption rates of thorium than those of uranium.

The Th(IV) uptake at different thorium nitrate concentrations (from 0.25 to 25 mM) was evaluated. The thorium content in the aqueous solution was determined by neutron activation analysis. Th(IV) retained by zeolites was 1.7 and 3.7 meq/g for crionite and X zeolite. In order to explain the thorium sorption process in both zeolites, ion exchange mechanism was considered. It was found that thorium sorption behavior is strongly dependent of the type of zeolite, the separation factor for Mexican erionite was alpha (Th(IV))(Na(I))<1, this zeolite shows preference for Na(I) rather than for Th(IV), however, by X zeolite, &alpha;(TH(IV))(Na(I))similar to1, this value suggested an approximately ideal ion exchange behavior.

The uranium uptake and cation exchange capacities of zeolite were determined. The effect of initial uranium concentrations in solution was studied in detail at the Optimum conditions determined before (pH 2.0, contact time: 60 minutes, temperature: 20 degreesC). The uptake equilibrium is best described by Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Some thermodynamic parameters (DeltaHdegrees, DeltaSdegrees, DeltaGdegrees) of the adsorption system were also determined. Application to fixation of uranium to zeolite was performed. The uptake of uranium complex on zeolite followed Langmuir adsorption isotherm for the initial concentration (25 to 100 mug/ml). Thermodynamic values of DeltaGdegrees, DeltaSdegrees and DeltaHdegrees found show the spontaneous and exothermic nature of the process of uranium ions uptake by natural zeolite.

The obtained product was characterized using IR, DTA-TG, X-ray diffraction and elemental analyses. According to X-ray patterns, H2Ti5O11.nH(2)O with monoclinic structure has been formed on dehydration of semicrystalline sodium titanate. Kinetic studies of the order and activation energy of a new phase transformation have been determined from IDTA-thermograms. The ion exchange behavior of semicrystal line sodium titanate was studied at different gamma-doses as well as at different drying temperatures. The laboratory-scale ion exchange capacity, distribution studies and exchange performance for some radionuclides of a thermally prepared material were investigated. It was found that the exchange capacity was not changed after 100 kGy irradiation.

Zr(IV). Eu(III) and Am(III) from 3.5M nitric acid with a series of gamma-pre-irradiated symmetrical and unsymmetrical monoamides in benzene has been investigated up to a dose of 100 Mrad. The results indicated that the radiolytic stability is influenced by the structure of amides. Symmetrical monoamides seem to be less affected by radiation compared with unsymmetrical monoamides. Infrared studies identify the final products of radiolysis as the respective carboxylic acids and amines. The radiolytic degradation of the investigated monoamides has been estimated by quantitative IR spectroscopy. Extraction data obtained under similar experimental conditions For U(VI), Th(IV) and Zr(IV) with the TBP/benzene system have also been compared.

Quartz containing Np-237, Pu-238, Am-241 and H-3 was introduced into the aquifier with a stainless steel tube. The local water flow in the aquifer was monitored using a 3-dimensional sampling system. The contaminated area of the aquifer was obtained wholly with the help of a pre-installed stainless steel frame and cut into small pieces (samples) 3-dimensionally and analyzed. H-3 in the water samples was determined with a liquid scintillation analyzer (Tri-Camb 2250). Radioactivity of Np-237 and Am-241 in the soil samples were determined with a low energy photon detector (HPGe), Pu-238 was analyzed with a low background alphabeta detector after chemical separation. The result of the 3-year experiment indicated that Np-237, Pu-238 and Am-241 were strongly absorbed by the loess aquifer. The retardation factor of Np-237 in the loess aquifer was 1.54.10(4).

The observations can be explained by a conventional approach. The alternative perspective does not use the irreversible oxygen/water couple and it is easier to understand than virial expansions and Pitzer coefficients.

J	Ohde, S				Ohde, S			Instrumental neutron activation analysis of carbonatites from Homa Mountain, Kenya	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							RARE-EARTH-ELEMENTS; MANTLE; MELTS	Twenty eight (major and trace) elements including eight rare earth elements (REEs) in African carbonatite samples were determined by instrumental neutron activation analysis. The geochemical behavior of trace elements was studied in relation to the order of carbonatite intrusion from C1 to C4 through C2 and C3 at Homa Mountain, Kenya. The enrichment of Mn, Fe, Sr, Ba, Th, U and REE is found in the sixteen carbonatites examined in this study. The general increase in the concentrations of Na, Sc, Mn, Sb, Ba, Th. U and REE occurs from C I to C4 through C2 and C2c, but C3 carbonatite shows a different pattern. The C3 carbonatite is extraordinarily enriched in Mn, Fe and Ba and is highly enriched in Cr, As, Sb and Th. The chondrite-normalized REE distribution pattern of the C3 carbonatite is not rich in the light REE. Strong fractionation between light and heavy REEs is found in the carbonatites, and moderate fractionation in the two alkalic igneous rock samples. In order to evaluate partitioning of REEs into carbonate, oxide and other mineral fractions, a selective chemical leaching technique on carbonatites was applied and is discussed in this study.

However, some recent Publications have promoted the view that limited supplies of natural uranium are the Achilles heel of nuclear power as the sector contemplates a larger contribution to future clean energy. This paper summarises some of the perspectives and analysis that support the following conclusion: uranium supply, like that for other metals, is economically sustainable. This means that normally functioning metals markets and technology change provide the drivers to ensure that supply at costs affordable to consumers is continuously replenished, both through the discovery of new resources and the redefinition (in economic terms) of known ones.

This paper argues that for several more decades. water-cooled reactors, and particularly (LWRs), light-water reactors, will be the backbone for base-load electricity generation. Generation IV reactor types may enter this market in about 30 years from now, provided they become competitive with LWRs or are needed as a complement to LWRs to penetrate new energy markets such as hydrogen production and/or to stretch out uranium resources. It also discusses the issue of winning public acceptance for new nuclear build.

J	Ohoka, Y; Sekimoto, H				Ohoka, Y; Sekimoto, H			Application of CANDLE burnup to block-type high temperature gas cooled reactor	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								The CANDLE burnup strategy, where the distributions of fuel nuclide densities, neutron flux, and power density move with the same constant speed and without any change in their shapes, is applied to the block-type high temperature gas cooled reactor. If it is successful, a burnup control rod can be eliminated, and several merits are expected. This burnup may be realized by enriched uranium and burnable poison with large neutron absorption cross-section. With the fuel enrichment of 15%, gadolinium concentration of 3.0%, and fuel cell pitch of 6.6 cm, the CANDLE burnup is realized with the burning region moving speed of 29 cm/year and the axial half-width of power density distribution of 1.5 m. When the concentration of natural gadolinium is higher, the burning region moving speed becomes slower and the burnup becomes higher, though the effective neutron multiplication factor becomes smaller. When U-235 enrichment is higher, the effective neutron multiplication factor becomes larger, the speed becomes slower, and the burnup becomes higher. When the pitch is wider, the effective neutron multiplication factor becomes larger, the speed becomes faster, and the burnup becomes higher. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

J	Song, MC; Lee, KJ				Song, MC; Lee, KJ			A study on a magnetic separation of radioactive corrosion products from NPP using permanent magnets	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							CHEMISTRY; PWR	It is important to emphasize that the current trend to longer fuel cycles (18-24 months) has complicated the dilemma of finding optimum chemical condition for the primary coolant because of some problems such as increase of radioactive corrosion products, possibility of axial offset anomaly and so on. Radioactive corrosion products which are generated by the neutron activation of general corrosion products at a nuclear power plant are the major source of occupational radiation exposure. Generally, radioactive corrosion products exit in soluble and insoluble forms, and are removed by ion exchangers and purification filters. Most of the insoluble radioactive corrosion products have the characteristic of showing strong ferrimagnetism. Along with the new development and production of permanent magnets (rare earth magnets) which generate much stronger magnetic fields than conventional permanent magnets, a new type of magnetic filter is suggested that can efficiently separate corrosion products using rotation of permanent magnets. This new magnetic filter reveals good performance results in filtering magnetite, cobalt ferrite and nickel ferrite from aqueous coolant simulation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Therefore, burn-up is expected to be increased from 60 to 70 MWd/kg U. The change in the fuel radial power distribution as a function of fuel burn-up can affect the radial fuel temperature distribution as well as the fuel microstructure in the fuel pellet rim. Both of these features, commonly termed the "rim effect." High burn-up phenomena in WWER-440 UO(2) fuel pin, which are important for fission gas release (FGR) were modeled. The radial burn-up as a function of the pellet radius and enrichment has to be known to determine the local thermal conductivity. In this paper, the radial burn-up and fissile products distributions of WWER-440 UO(2) fuel pin were evaluated using MCNP4B and ORIGEN2 codes. The impact of the thermal conductivity on predicted FGR calculations is needed. For the analysis, a typical WWER-440 fuel pin and surrounding water moderator are considered in a hexagonal pin well. The thermal release and the athermal release from the pellet rim were modeled separately. The fraction of the rim structure and the excessive porosity in the rim structure in isothermal irradiation as a function of the fuel burn-up was predicted.

J	Contri, P; Gurpinar, A; Labbe, P				Contri, P; Gurpinar, A; Labbe, P			Design of nuclear facilities other than NPPs in relation to external events	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								The safety of a nuclear installation requires in general that it is sited, designed, constructed and operated to protect individuals, society and the environment against an uncontrolled release of radioactivity. External events, both natural and human-induced, play a major role in challenging the plant defense. Therefore, appropriate design provisions are needed to assure an adequate safety margin in case of such events. In recent years, the development of design criteria, design methodologies and assessment approaches for external events received major emphasis for nuclear power plants. Other nuclear installations, however, received less attention even though their radioactive inventory may be quite significant (sometimes comparable with the NPPs, like in the case of some research reactors or fuel re-processing plants). Also the risks for radiological (and chemical) contamination is often rather high (as in the case of the fuel re-processing plants) and their location may be very close to densely populated areas. There is a lack of generally accepted international standards in this field and the direct application of general safety principles for nuclear installations is not straightforward. The IAEA addressed this issue in the past several years. Some of the results have been collected in an IAEA Technical Document (TECDOC). This paper is intended to address some of the main issues that have been identified and discussed in the referenced document. 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The measurement principle of this type of tritium process monitor is observing the bremsstrahlung X-rays generated by the interaction between beta particles from tritium and a gold film coated on the inner surfaces of a small measuring cell. A linear relationship between the counting rate of bremsstrahlung X-rays and the tritium concentration was observed for the concentration range of 10(2)-10(6) GBq/m(3), and the sensitivity of the monitor was determined to be about 0.5 GBq/m(3)/CPM in this concentration range. A linear response of this monitor was also observed for a tritium mixture diluted with deuterium. In addition, as an example of its practical use, this monitor was confirmed to be applicable to tracing He-3 release from a uranium bed during heating. These results show that this type of tritium monitor is very promising as a process monitor for the fuel processing system of fusion reactors. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Monitoring stations separate xenon from air and perform isotopic analysis of the radioxenon. In one such radioxenon measurement scheme, the isotopes of interest are identified by coincident spectroscopy of electrons and photons in a beta/gamma coincidence spectrometer (BGCS). The beta spectrometer is a plastic scintillator, manufactured as a cylindrical cell containing the separated xenon sample. This cell is surrounded by the NaI(Tl) gamma spectrometer. We report here the development of a calibration process for the BGCS suitable for use in remote sampling systems. This procedure is based upon gamma-ray Compton scattering, resulting in a true coincident signal in both detectors, generation of electrons over a wide energy range that matches the energy distribution of electrons from radioxenon decay, and a relative insensitivity to source location. In addition to gain calibration, this procedure determines the resolution of the beta detector as a function of energy. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The radiation field outside a boiling water reactor 8 x 8 fuel assembly with varying patterns of fuel rods replaced with lead dummies was calculated using a simple model for the source distribution and the Monte Carlo code MCNP-4C for the radiation field. In particular, the sensitivity of the thermal neutron field as measured in a Fork detector to various replacement patterns was investigated. The results suggest a detection limit of 5% of the fuel mass replaced, i.e., 3 out of 63 rods, independently of the pattern of the replaced rods.

The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the existence of hydrogen in an outside pipe on the amount of permeated deuterium through the pipe. It was found that the amount of permeated deuterium decreases by increasing the partial pressure of hydrogen in the outside pipe when the partial pressure of deuterium in the pipe is lower than 100 Pa and that of hydrogen in the outside pipe is larger than 10 kPa. The amount of permeated deuterium on counter permeation was predicted quantitatively by using an effectiveness factor for diffusivity of deuterium in metals and by taking into account the equilibrium state for hydrogen, deuterium, and HD molecules on the metal surface. From the results obtained in this study, it is supposed that the amount of tritium transferred from the primary circuit of the HTTR to the hydrogen production system will be reduced by the existence of high-pressure hydrogen in the catalyst pipe of the steam reformer.

J	Lavi, N; Groppi, F; Alfassi, ZB				Lavi, N; Groppi, F; Alfassi, ZB			On the measurement of K-40 in natural and synthetic materials by the method of high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometry	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article						gamma spectrometry; K concentration in NORM; NORM	RADIOACTIVITY; SAMPLES; ROCKS	In the measurement of natural occurring radioactive material (NORM) concentrations of K-40, Th-232 and U-238 are measured by passive gamma ray spectrometry with either HPGe or NaI(Tl) detectors. K-40 is measured through its 1460.8 kcVy line. However, till now it has been ignored that this line is mixed with the 1459.2 keV line of Ac-228 from the chain of Th-232. A correction must be made for this contribution. All the data in literature has wrong data about the concentration of K-40 although in many cases the error is less than 1%. However, there are cases of considerably higher errors. It should be emphasized that even if the correction in K-40 concentration is large the correction of external dose index is negligible due to the higher weighing factor for Th-232 than for K-40 (by at least a factor of 10).

J	Suarez-Navarro, JA; Pujol, L				Suarez-Navarro, JA; Pujol, L			Determination of potassium concentration in salt water for residual beta radioactivity measurements	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article							RANGE	High interferences may arise in the determination of potassium concentration in salt water. Several analytical methods were studied to determine which method provided the most accurate measurements of potassium concentration. This study is relevant for radiation protection because the exact amount of potassium in water samples must be known for determinations of residual beta activity concentration. The fitting algorithm of the calibration curve and estimation of uncertainty in potassium determinations were also studied. The reproducibility of the proposed analytical method was tested by internal and external validation. Furthermore, the residual beta activity concentration of several Spanish seawater and brackish river water samples was determined using the proposed method. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The newly discovered Erasama beach placer deposit, part of the eastern coast of Orissa State, India is a high natural background radiation area, due to the presence of radiogenic heavy minerals. The average activity concentrations of radioactive elements such as Th-232, U-238 and K-40, measured by gamma-ray spectrometry using an HPGe detector, and found to be 2825 +/- 50, 350 +/- 20 and 180 +/- 25 Bq kg(-1), respectively, for the bulk sand samples. The absorbed gamma dose rates in air due to the naturally occurring radionuclides varied from 650 to 3150 nGy h(-1) with a mean value of 1925 +/- 718 nGy h(-1). The annual external effective dose rates for the region varyed from 0.78 to 3.86 mSv yr(-1) with a mean value of 2.36 +/- 0.88 mSv yr(-1). The external gamma dose rate level of Erasama coastal region is similar to the other monazite sand bearing high background radiation areas of southern and southwestern coastal regions of India. The major contributors to the enhanced level of radiation are monazites and to a lesser extent in zircons. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Frolov, AM				Frolov, AM			Bremsstrahlung emitted during (n; t)-reactions in light atomic systems	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						bremsstrahlung; tritium; spectrum	NEUTRON-CAPTURE THERAPY	Bremsstrahlung emitted during (n; t)-nuclear reactions in light atoms and ions is discussed by using both the classical and quantum-mechanical approaches. In particular, the spatial and angular distributions of the emitted radiation and its spectrum are considered in detail. It is shown that the total radiation I(t) rapidly decreases with time I(t)similar tot(-4) at large t. The spectral density of the emitted bremsstrahlung is also studied. In general, bremsstrahlung emitted during (n; t)-nuclear reactions in the fast ions and atoms can be used to study the electron-electron position correlations in these systems. The approach developed in our present study can also be applied to describe the emission of bremsstrahlung during (n;p)- and (n;alpha)-nuclear reactions in light atoms, spontaneous and neutron-stimulated nuclear fission in heavy atoms.
