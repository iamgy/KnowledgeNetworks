In particular, we have investigated the angular dependence of production cross-sections for the Lbeta(2,4) and Lbeta(1,3) lines which can be obtained with some ease for U and Th in Si(Li) detector. The experimental values of cross-sections were obtained by using the absolute yield of L subshell X-rays emitted from a target of a given element and thickness when bombarded with a known flux of photons of given energy. The theoretical values of the cross-sections were estimated from the theoretical values of subshell photoionization cross-sections, fluorescence yields, Coster-Kronig transition probabilities and relative decay rates. The enhancement effect of the Coster-Kronig transition have been calculated for these elements at the same photon energy. The present experimental results have been compared with theoretical and other experimental values. It has been found that the present experimental results are in good agreement with theoretical and the experimental values of others. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Firstly, an isotopic separation of an enriched lutetium sample was used to reach a purity of Lu-176 close to 99.993%. Afterwards, the high neutron flux of the Grenoble Institut Laue-Langevin reactor was used to produce the Lu-177m isomer by the Lu-176(n, gamma) reaction. Finally, a chemical separation was performed to extract 10(13) nuclei of Lu-177m. Thanks to this experiment, we have been able to estimate the destruction cross-section of the Lu-177m.

Vacuum requirements prevent the use of a gas-filled charge exchange cell. The simple alternative is to implant the ion beam into a hot catcher foil where the ions neutralize within the foil and then diffuse out. The fraction of ions which neutralize depends upon the work function of the foil and first ionization potential of the ion beam. In order to produce such a neutralizer several suitable materials were tested in a variety of different mechanical designs to determine the most effective and robust system. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

One is a thick disk target with water-cooling being developed for the in-flight RI beam separator (BigRIPS). An in-beam test was performed using Ar-40 beam at 24 AMeV, 1.9 particle muA, with the beam spot size 3 turn in diameter, resulting 0.25 GW/m(2) beam power stopped at the surface of carbon disk 2 turn in thickness and 260 mm in diameter. It performed stably without melting. A simulation study has been developed and its possibility for the use of BigRIPS is discussed. The second is a thin target foil mounted on a wheel disk which rotates in He cooling gas of 13.32-133.2 Pa. Its main use is in fusion reactions to search for super-heavy elements by using the gas-filled recoil separator (GARIS). A typical foil is Pb or Bi of 200-300 mug/cm(2) in thickness evaporated onto a carbon backing foil of 30 mug/cm(2) thickness, and covered by evaporated carbon of 10 mug/cm(2) thickness. It can withstand long use under high-intensity Ni-64 beam at 311 MeV, and 0.5 particle muA. 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Complex structure, highly permeable C matrices are described for coating with optimum thicknesses of any type of refractory target material (metal, carbide or oxide). Prescriptions are given for the design and fabrication of custom-engineered targets with diffusion lengths compatible with the release of isotopes of interest within their lifetimes. Computationally derived thermal analysis information is presented for selected low-density, fibrous, highly permeable targets, subjected to direct irradiation with I GeV, 100-400 kW proton beams. From these studies, internal thermal radiation is reconfirmed as an important heat transfer (cooling) mechanism within low-density, fibrous and composite targets. By utilization of the radiation cooling effect and beam manipulation techniques, in combination with placement of additional heat shielding on the exit end of targets, beam power depositional densities can be controlled and temperatures homogenized to acceptable levels within fast diffusion release, fast effusive-flow ISOL targets subjected to irradiation with 400 kW proton beams, as required at next-generation radioactive ion beam facilities, (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

A simple, fast, inexpensive and close to universal method, based on suspension of finely divided target material in a binder to form a paint, has been developed that can be vacuum infiltrated to uniformly coat the surfaces of highly permeable fibrous target matrices with compound target materials and thus, form fast diffusion-release, mechanically and thermally stable production targets for ISOL-based radioactive ion beam research applications. In this report, the paint infiltration technique is described and the universal character of the technique illustrated by preparing several nitride, carbide, oxide and sulfide targets for potential use at the Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility or at future high energy ISOL-based research facilities such as the Rare Isotope Accelerator facility, now under proposal for construction in the USA.

These radioactive ion beams are then accelerated to energies of a few MeV per nucleon and delivered to experimental stations for use in nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics experiments. At the heart of this facility is the RIB production target, where the radioactive nuclei are produced using beams of light ions (p, d, He-3, alpha) to induce nuclear reactions in the target nuclei. Several target materials have been developed and used successfully, including Al2O3, HfO2, SiC, CeS, liquid Ge, liquid Ni, and a low-density matrix of uranium carbide. The details of these targets and some of the target developments that led to the delivery of high-quality radioactive ion beams are discussed in this paper. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

From the thermal analysis, iterations in the design approaches can lead to effective target conceptual designs that can bypass a series of prototype tests. Emphasis will be made for conductive cooling approaches, for which comprehensive thermal conductivity data are required for all components. Additional thermal properties are needed if radiative cooling or shielding is incorporated in target concepts. The example is presented of a uranium/carbon target to produce fission-product activities, featuring sensitivities to power dissipation and thermal properties assumed in the analyses.

Primary beams from the 15UD Pelletron accelerator are used on a hydrogenous target and the RIB is separated and re-focused to a secondary target position using the existing recoil mass spectrometer (RMS), HIRA operated in a new ion-optical configuration. To satisfy the ion-optical requirement of a well-defined object spot-size, we opted for polypropylene foil targets instead of hydrogen gas. As these foils get rapidly damaged with beam irradiation, a new design has been used to fabricate a rotary/linear motion device. This design allows the utilization of large area foils as production targets. It also, intrinsically, avoids scattering of primary beam from unwanted materials, which is crucial for beam rejection with an RMS operating at zero degrees. In this paper we present the details of the design and beam test results. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The different elements composing this separator are described. The ion beam, produced by a "Bernas-Nier" source, is separated by a high dispersion analyzing magnet. Thin targets of highly enriched isotopes are achieved by deceleration of the selected ion beam. The thickness of the targets can reach a few mg/cm(2). The homogeneity and thickness of the target are measured by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry. The isotopic enrichment factor obtained with SIDONIE is evaluated by measurement of alpha emission of a U-235 thin target. Finally, an alpha spectrum of metrology measurement of U-238 is presented. A thin layer of pure U-238 produced by SIDONIE has been measured with a high-resolution alpha spectrometer equipped with an optimized silicon junction detector. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The deposition occurs from an isopropanolic solution at 1000-1200V with current densities of a few mA/cm(2). Several lanthanide targets have been prepared for test experiments. With Gd-nat deposited on a 10 mum thick Be backing foil a target density of I 100 mug/cm(2) could be achieved. Gd-targets were used for the production of a-emitting isotopes of Os, the homologue of hassium (Hs; Z = 108), in order to develop a chemical separation procedure for Hs. Cm-248 targets with densities up to 730 mug/cm(2) have been produced for recent experiments to investigate the chemical behaviour of Hs. Here, a rotating wheel system with a multi-target device has been applied enabling higher beam intensities, compared to a stationary target. The targets were irradiated with a pulsed Mg-26(5+) beam applying beam currents up to 6.6 muA(electr). An alpha-spectroscopic investigation of the irradiated Cm-targets showed that the Cm-material is not evenly distributed over the entire target area. Very often, for heavy element investigations, chemical separation procedures are required to ensure high purity of the deposited actinide materials. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The d-orbital energy (Md) as an alloying parameter well reproduces the alloying behaviour of gamma-uranium metal with TMs: (1) in the case of a large Md value (Ti, V, Cr), the solubility of these TM elements in gamma-uranium becomes large; (2) in the case of a middle Md value (Mn, Fe, Co), the tendency to form a uranium intermetallic compound with these elements becomes stronger; (3) in the case of a small Md value (Cu), the alloying element is insoluble in gamma-uranium. The alloying behaviour of gamma-uranium with TMs is also discussed in terms of other parameters such as electronegativity and metallic radius. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kim, YS				Kim, YS			Theoretical analysis of two-stage fission gas release processes: grain lattice and grain boundary diffusion	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							HIGH BURNUP; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; NUCLEAR-FUEL; UO2; IRRADIATION; MIGRATION	A theoretical analysis of two-stage fission gas release processes, grain lattice and grain boundary diffusion, coupled with bubble trapping and resolution, is carried out. Final results show that the conventional single-stage fractional release solution can be expanded for the two-stage release case with the introduction of a new dimensionless parameter a/(alpha+a) where alpha is the relative diffusivity ratio defined as D-v (eff)//D-gb(eff). In fact, alpha is a temperature- and burn-up-dependent gas transport property. Recent evaluations of alpha demonstrate that grain boundaries can play significant roles in fission gas release, depending on the fuel power history, and the high burn-up behaviour of fission gasses can be directly reflected in the two-stage parameter. Inter-granular bubble linkages effectively increase the two-stage parameter, which leads to apparent burn-up enhancement of the fractional fission gas release. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Post-irradiation examinations show that molybdenum is mainly associated with rhodium, ruthenium, palladium and technetium in metallic precipitates. However, for low burn-ups, these five metal particles cannot be detected. In order to determine the chemical state of molybdenum in UO2, XANES experiments were carried out on fresh UO2 pellets implanted with Mo ions. The measurements performed at the oxygen K and molybdenum L-III edges showed a correlation between the chemical state of molybdenum and the O/U ratio of the UO2 matrix. Indeed, the molybdenum located at the grain boundaries is present in both metallic and +IV oxidation states. To our knowledge, this study is the first experimental evidence of the solution annealing of Mo+IV in the cationic lattice of UO2. Thus, when molybdenum is oxidised at the +IV state, it remains in solution in the UO2 matrix. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The experiments were carried out with carbonated groundwater on previously leached sections of clad fuel rods in static mode, in an aerated medium at room temperature (25 degreesC in a hot cell. Until 313 days of leaching and below uranium saturation, the Sr/U congruence ratios for all the UO2, fuel samples ranged from I to 2; allowing for the experimental uncertainty, strontium can thus be considered as a satisfactory matrix alteration tracer. No significant burnup effect was observed on the alteration of the UO2 fuel matrix. The daily strontium release factor was approximately 2.7 x 10(-8) d(-1) for UO2 fuel after 706 days of leaching, and seven to eight times higher for MOX fuel. Several alteration mechanisms (radiolysis, solubility, precipitation/clogging) are examined to account for the experimental findings. All the available experimental data (characterization of secondary phases and leaching data) indicate that the mechanism limiting the spent fuel alteration kinetics, for the conditions studied, is likely based on the transport and accessibility of oxidizing species and/or water within the segment.

J	Rest, J				Rest, J			A model for the influence of microstructure, precipitate pinning and fission gas behavior on irradiation-induced recrystallization of nuclear fuels	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							RIM-STRUCTURE FORMATION; HIGH BURNUP UO2; TRANSMISSION ELECTRON-MICROSCOPY; GRAIN SUBDIVISION; XENON-DEPLETION; PORE FORMATION; BUBBLES; GROWTH; EVOLUTION; SIZE	Irradiation-induced recrystallization appears to be a general phenomenon in that it is observed to occur in a variety of nuclear fuel types, e.g. U-xYMo, UO(2), and U(3)O(8). For temperatures below that where significant thermal annealing of defects occurs, an expression is derived for the fission density at which irradiation-induced recrystallization is initiated that is a thermal and weakly dependent oil fission rate. The initiation of recrystallization is to be distinguished from the subsequent progression and eventual consumption of the original fuel grain. The formulation takes into account the observed microstructural evolution of the fuel, the role of precipitate pinning and fission gas bubbles, and the triggering event for recrystallization. The calculated dislocation density, fission gas bubble-size distribution, and fission density at which recrystallization first appears are compared to measured quantities. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Recent progress in the production and cooling of intense beams of fully stripped An and U in the SIS/ESR synchrotron storage ring at GSI, Darmstadt has made it possible to obtain precision spectroscopy of these ions. A fully stripped beam of either Au79+ or U92+ ions is injected, stored and cooled in the ESR and interacts with an internal gas target. The capture of an electron and the subsequent population of a 2p or 3p state will lead to a decay by either Lyman or Balmer X-ray emission. Although measurements of the 1 s Lamb shift in U with Ge ionization detectors accurate to similar to3% have provided a test of QED for the high Z domain, the experimental errors (+/-13 eV) are about one order of magnitude larger than the accuracy theoreticians presently claim (1 eV). We present the results from initial broad band experiments using NTD Ge microcalorimeters to measure the 2 s Lamb Shift in An and U at the ESR. The broad band coverage of the microcalorimeter makes it possible to reduce the systematic uncertainties in the Doppler corrections while the high-energy resolution reduces the statistical error in the absolute energy calibration.

The aim of the experiment was to determine with high accuracy the isotope ratio of U-236/U-238 for several samples of natural uranium, U-236 being known as a sensitive monitor for neutron flux. Measurements were performed at the VERA tandem accelerator at Vienna, Austria. The detectors consist of sapphire absorbers and superconducting transition edge thermometers operated at T approximate to 1.5K. The relative energy resolution obtained for 17.39MeV U-238 is DeltaE/E = 4-9 x 10(-3), depending on the experimental conditions. This performance enabled to substantially reduce background from neighbouring isotopes and to increase the detection efficiency. Due to the high sensitivity achieved, a value of U-236/U-231 =6.5 x 10(-12) could be obtained, representing the smallest U-236/U-238 ratio measured until now. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Conventional methods of activity measurement suffer from source self-absorption and a strong decrease in detection efficiency for low-energy electrons and photons. We propose a new method based on metallic magnetic microcalorimeters with the source embedded in the detector target in a 4pi geometry. First results with a Fe-55 source show that electrons and photons are detected with a detection efficiency close to unity and with little loss of energy for electrons. The aim of this study is to provide standards of activity with very low uncertainties in the framework of radiation metrology. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thermal gain factors in excess of 50 were observed due to the primary ionization drifting in the large applied field, with only minimal increase in phonon noise. The observed thermal gain corresponds to an intrinsic threshold of 20eV, resulting in detectors that have direct application for use in a neutrino magnetic moment measurement based on a 40-MCi tritium source.

To improve the present sensitivity of EDELWEISS to WIMP interactions by a further factor 100, ultra-low radioactivity detector holders exclusively made of copper and Teflon have been designed. The new design is using the relative expansion coefficients of copper, Teflon and germanium to hopefully ensure a dissipation-free detector holding. In order to validate this new holder, we need to compare the vibration behavior of the old holder and the new one. The amplitude of the bolometer vibrations is measured using the variation of capacitance between electrodes sputtered on the Ge crystal and reference electrodes fixed above the detector holders. We present noise measurements and compare them to the equivalent measurements using the detector holders of the Edelweiss-I experiment, which gave very satisfying results. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

These studies have shown-that the experimental energies of the EC decay lines are slightly different from the ones expected from theory. A true calorimetric measurement should be able to fix definitively the level energies. In 1996 (Phys. Lett. B 398 (1996) 415), the first calorimetric measurement of this spectrum was obtained by the Genoa group, which was able to resolve the doublet MI-MII and NI-NII at about 1800 and 400 eV, respectively. The major drawback of this detector was the absorber, which had not been homogeneously made because the radioactive source was in dielectric form surrounded by the superconducting absorber. Here we present a new absorber for Ho-163 experiment, which will be used in a new calorimetric measurement. It consists of a superconducting compound of yttrium, Y3Rh4Sn13, in which Ho-163 is homogeneously spread. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The XRS will utilize a newly developed 2-D microcalorimeter array of 32 pixels that will provide a resolution of similar to 6 eV over the energy range 0.3-10 keV. The detector is characterized by the energy scale and,energy, resolution, both of which vary with design and operating parameters. We have calibrated the gain scale and energy resolution over a range of operating parameters including bias voltage, temperature, and incident photon flux. We will present the response of the cumulative detector array as well as a measure of the uniformity of the individual pixels. One pixel is physically offset from the array and will be continuously illuminated by a radioactive source in-flight. We will show the accuracy with which this pixel can be used to monitor variations in the focal plane array. Finally we have illuminated the array with a high-energy, continuum source and measured the Hg absorption edges in order to characterize the absorption efficiency of the pixels.

J	Cometto, M; Wydler, P; Chawla, R				Cometto, M; Wydler, P; Chawla, R			A comparative physics study of alternative long-term strategies for closure of the nuclear fuel cycle	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								The appropriate management of radioactive waste arising from the nuclear fuel cycle is considered to be a key issue in the development of future, more sustainable nuclear energy systems. In this context, the partitioning and transmutation of actinides could play an important role through the achievement of very significant reductions in the actinide content and radiotoxicity of the high-level waste requiring geological disposal. The current paper reports on the results of a detailed physics study carried out to compare the pros and cons of alternative strategies for closure of the nuclear fuel cycle. Different long-term "steady-state" scenarios have been considered, involving the deployment, to varying degrees, of light water reactors (LWRs) and advanced fast-spectrum systems. The same nuclear data and calculation methods have been used throughout, so that a consistent and reliable comparison of the relative performance of the three basic fuel cycle options (once-through, plutonium recycle, and recycling of all actinides) has been made possible. In addition, with transmutation having been considered employing both critical and accelerator-driven fast-spectrum systems, the study has provided an evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of these two different advanced system types.

The Monte Carlo code, MCNP4C, was used to model and analyze the spent fuel pool walls. In addition, the gamma source from the spent fuel assembly was modeled by the isotope generation and depletion code, ORIGEN2.2. Both PWR (TMI-1) and BWR (PB-2) spent fuel pool models were investigated. The primary objective of the study was to determine the arrangement of the spent fuel assemblies to minimize the gamma radiation to the spent fuel pool walls. Different cases of spent fuel assembly configurations in the spent fuel pool were studied. The study results show the amount of gamma radiation deposited on each section of the spent fuel pool walls. Finally, the spent fuel assembly with axial peaking factor was also studied. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Event trees have been used to study the response of the installation to various initiating events whereas fault trees have been used in the modelling of safety system failures. Using generic data, the probability of an accident leading to severe core damage (greater than or equal to 10% of core melted) from internal initiating events has been estimated to be 3 x 10(-6) per year of reactor operation. The largest contributions to the probability of small damage are made by accidents initiated by loss of cooling and excess reactivity. Large releases of radioactivity are expected with a negligibly low frequency of about 1 x 10(-11)/year. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Therefore, this technology for obtaining Tc-99m is waste-free from the standpoint of radiation. Tc-99 accumulation in liquid radioactive wastes is estimated.

The structure of the power supply system, too, will undergo major changes. Both the expansion of the EU and the reliability of electricity supply are topical problems in need of perspectives of solutions. Nuclear power can and will contribute to these Solutions. For Germany, it is imperative that an energy consensus be worked out and put into effect across all party lines in an effort to create reliable framework conditions for the next twenty or thirty years. The goal must be a balanced energy mix also ensuring the competitiveness of Germany as an industrialized country. The individual strengths of each of the energy sources must be pooled so as to result in an optimum. Foregoing the use of nuclear power in the future is wrong in respect of the national economy, power economy, and climate policy. Developments in the neighboring countries in Europe and worldwide document that the opting-out policy of the German federal government is an approach peculiar to Germany. The final storage of radioactive waste in Germany is a topic to be finalized speedily. The Konrad and Gorleben mines constitute a promising concept of final storage of all types of radioactive waste in Germany. This goal must be pursued further in a firm policy and must not be delayed by new site selection procedures. In the field of nuclear research, Germany must not be separated from international developments. Nuclear competence must be preserved and promoted. The future power supply situation in Europe is characterized by the need for a considerable addition of generating capacity. As is demonstrated by the project of the new nuclear power plant to be built in Finland, nuclear power is going to play an important role in meeting this need.

J	Brejora, S				Brejora, S			2004 Winter Meeting: Nuclear Power and the Continuity of Supply in the Enlarged European Union	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								One aspect in the agreement between the German federal government and the power utilities of June 14, 2000 is the legal obligation to build and use interim stores on the premises of nuclear power plants. KLE GmbH, the operator of the Emsland nuclear power station (K-KE) in Lingen, early on commissioned a study of the possibilities for building such an on-site interim store to hold spent fuel elements on the KKE plant premises. The official start of the project was in 1998. Within eighteen months, the Lingen on-site interim store (SZL) with a capacity of up to 130 casks was built as planned and on schedule. Some twenty different firms were engaged in construction and completion of the buildings and the ambient infrastructure. The building structures consumed approx. 6 000 Mg of steel and 20 000 m(3) of concrete. The total cost of the SZL amounts to approx. Euro 26.0 million. This amount breaks down into Euro 20.0 million for construction, roughly half of it each spent on buildings and on technical plant systems, and Euro 6.0 million for ancillary building costs. After the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS) had granted the Permit Under Sec. 6 of the German Atomic Energy Act, the first few casks of the CASTOR(R)) V/19 type were loaded in the reactor building of KKE in late 2002, transported to the SZL by means of a vehicle purchased specially for on-site cask transport, and emplaced. After successfully commissioning the SZL, the Emsland nuclear power plant now has a modem interim store equipped with excellent safety features, and with sufficient, safe fuel element holding capacity for the fuel elements currently kept in the storage pool as well as all the fuel arising in the residual operating life of the nuclear power plant.

J	Becker, K				Becker, K			Causes, consequences, and therapy of the radiophobia syndrom	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								The final storage of high-level radioactive waste, which is said to be still open while, in fact. it was solved technically a long time ago and is only being blocked for political reasons, as well as alleged technical risks of German nuclear power plants which have never been demonstrated or proven, are listed again and again as grounds for opting out of the use Of nuclear power. There is hardly any doubt that one of the main causes underlying also these arguments, and thus the main reason for the insufficient public acceptance of nuclear power in Germany at the present time as a safe, inexpensive, and non-polluting Source of primary energy. is the widespread fear of radiation (radiophobia). Consequently, Solutions proposed for successfully managing this radiophobia must be examined. Continued scientific Studies of the subject do not seem to be promising, as funds arc available at present only for continuing the search for negative biological effects. Important preconditions for a change in attitude are the appropriate initiatives to be taken by the relatively small number of sufficiently independent experts of proven scientific repute. Initiatives of this kind can now be observed in numerous countries and regions in the world. It must be pointed out in this connection, as is underlined again and again by experienced experts, that risk acceptance is not a matter of factual arguments, but of emotions. Psychological and pedagogic sensitivity certainly are important elements in changing public opinion in the interest of a more realistic assessment of the radiation risk and the acceptance of nuclear power.

J	Heller, W				Heller, W			Nationalplan for the management of radioactive residues	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								In published opinion, the management of waste from German nucleaand contained concrete outlines of a waste management concept. After the change in government in 1998, the waste management concept was pronounced to have failed. The German federal government is now working on a National Plan for the Management of Radioactive Residues announced as early as 1998. Major components mentioned are the limitation of waste volumes; the termination of reprocessing; decentralized interim storage; the avoidance of transports; proof of the existence of provisions for waste managenient; and the investigation of other repository sites. A critical review shows relatively little that is really new in this waste management plan. An end must be put to the delaying tactics of the players involved in nuclear waste management, which they are pursuing in justification of further spreading the fairy tale of the "absence of a landing strip."									0	0	0	0	0	VERLAGSGRP HANDELSBLATT GMBH	DUSSELDORF	POSTFACH 10 11 02, D-40002 DUSSELDORF, GERMANY	1431-5254			ATW-INT J NUCL POWER	ATW-Int.

Its specifications called for the outer shell to have an inner lining of PVA (poly(vinyl alcohol)) that would keep the xenon gas fill from occupying the target wall. The inner shell consisted of a glass shell coated with 2000 A of silver and filled with 9 atm of deuterium. Furthermore, the delivery deadline was less than seven weeks away. This paper describes the fielding of this double-shell target, made possible through the combined efforts of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and General Atomics target fabrication specialists.

In order to vary optical properties, we need to develop polyimides with high mechanical properties in which we have to substitute all the hydrogen atoms by deuterium atoms. The best way to obtain deuterated polymer is to deuterate monomers instead of direct deuteration of polymers. In a first part, mechanical properties of aromatic polyimide films based on two dianhydrides (pyromellitic dianhydride PAMA and 3,3',4,4'-biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride BPDA) and two diamines (4,4'-oxydianiline ODA and p-phenylenediamine PDA) have been described. The optimization of synthesis and fabrication parameters of polyimide films PAMA/ODA and BPDA/PDA having high inherent viscosity, so high molecular weight, have allowed us to obtain high mechanical properties. And in a second part, deuterated monomers have been synthesized via multi-steps organic reactions and/or under pressure conditions. We have investigated the preparation of deuterated poly(amic-acid) solutions in NMP and the preparation of the corresponding polyimides deuterated membranes. Results show that deuterium does not affect the reactivity of monomers to form the poly(amic-acid) solution.

These capsules contain the fusible deuterium-tritium mixture to achieve ignition. Coatings are prepared by glow discharge polymerization (GDP) with trans-2-butene and hydrogen. The films properties have been investigated Laser fusion targets must have optimized characteristics : a diameter of about 2.4 mm for LMJ targets, a thickness up to 175 mum, a sphericity and a thickness concentricity better than 99% and an outer and an inner roughness lower than 20 nm at high modes. The surface finish of these laser fusion targets must be extremely smooth to minimize hydrodynamic instabilities(1). Movchan and Demchishin, and later Thornton introduced a structure zone model (SZM) (2-5) based on both evaporated and sputtered metals. They investigated the influence of base temperature and the sputtering gas pressure on structure and properties of thick polycrystalline coatings of nickel, titanium, tungsten, aluminum oxide. An original cross-sectional analysis by atomic force microscopy (AFM) allows amorphous materials characterization and permits to make an analogy between the amorphous GDP material and the existing model (SZM). The purpose of this work is to understand the relationship between the deposition parameters, the growing structures and the surface roughness. The coating structure as a function of deposition parameters was first studied on plane silicon substrates and then optimized on PAMS shells. By adjusting the coating parameters, the structures are modified, and in some case, the high modes roughness decreases dramatically.

We. report here on our initial attempt to produce such shells. Glass shells made using the drop tower technique were coated with gold, palladium or tungsten, or a mixture of two of these elements. It was found that gold and palladium coatings did not stick well to the glass and resulted in poor or delaminated films. Tungsten coatings resulted in films suitable for these targets. Bouncing of shells during coating resulted in uniform tungsten coatings, but the surface of such coatings were filled with small nodules. Proper agitation of shells using a tapping technique resulted in smooth films with minimal particulate contamination. For coating rates of similar to0.15 mum/hr coatings with similar to2 nm RMS surface finish could be deposited. The surface roughness of coatings at higher rates, 0.7 mum/hr, was considerably worse (similar to100 nm RMS). The columnar structure of the coatings allowed permeation filling of the tungsten coated glass shells with deuterium at 300degreesC.

During cooling to 20 K, buckling and burst forces develop due to transient thermal gradients, thermal expansion differences in the materials of the capsule and the permeation cell, and changing permeability of the plastic. This article presents the results of both a steady-state and a transient analysis of the pressure differences across the thin-walled capsule during the cooling process. The steady-state contribution to the pressure difference arises from two sources: (1) the different thermal contractions of the materials that comprise the permeation cell and capsule and (2) the room-temperature volume of gas in the line connecting the permeation cell to the isolation valve. The transient analysis considers the pressure differences across the capsule wall that arise from the changing temperature gradients within the gas during the cooling cycle. Both effects have been taken into account to determine an approach that produces fuel-filled, thin-walled cryogenic targets more rapidly. Currently, capsules are slowly cooled at a rate of 0.1 K/min to prevent their destruction. This process requires over 45 h to complete. The results of the present model suggest a faster cooling program that takes into consideration the induced pressure differences, the permeation occurring at higher temperatures, and the strength of the capsule.. The time to cool a filled target can be reduced by 25% while maintaining capsule survival.

Specific models have been developed and used for both thermal and hydrodynamic calculations. With thermal calculations only, we first have found the optimum heat flux required to counteract the effect of the laser entrance windows. This heat flux is centered on the hohlraum wall along the axis of revolution. With this heat flux, the temperature surface profiles of the capsule and the DT ice layer have been significantly reduced Second, the sensitivity of the target temperature profiles (capsule and DT layer) relatively to capsule displacement has been determined. Thirdly, the effect of the shield extraction (shield surrounding the cryogenic structure) has been studied and has indicated that the target lifetime before the laser shot is less than Is. Meanwhile, with hydrodynamic simulations, we have investigated the surface temperature profiles alteration due to He and H-2 mixture convection within the hohlraum. In order to find out the variations between different configurations, results of these studies are given with seven significant digit outputs. Those results only indicate a trend because of the material's properties incertitude and the code approximation.

The complete model has been used to design and analyze experiments on infrared layering of D-2 in a hohlraum. The modeling provides an understanding of how to control the long scale length ice thickness perturbations by varying the infrared power balance and beam pointing. Based on the confidence developed in the model by comparison to experiment, design calculations are presented for IR layering systems for ICF ignition targets.

This thickness distribution is then used to make a second calculation of the temperature distribution with the same boundary conditions. Legendre polynomial coefficients are evaluated for the two temperature distributions and the two thickness profiles. Final equilibrium Legendre coefficients are determined by linear extrapolation. From these coefficients, the equilibrium layer thickness can be computed.

Improved characterization methods and infrared illumination enables low mode control in both the axial and azimuthal directions. We demonstrate control of the first two axial modes and first azimuthal mode using IR pointing. We demonstrate ice layers with axial P-1 amplitude less than 1 mum, and a reduction in P-2 amplitude from 20% to 8% of the ice thickness. Results of these experiments will be used to derive accuracy requirements for an infrared heating system for ice layers in hohlraums on NIF.

The D2TS provides the capability to perform integrated tests with many of the technologies necessary to deliver and shoot a cryogenic target on the National Ignition Facility (NIF). Procedures used to successfully fill and cool NIF ignition scale targets to cryogenic temperatures are reported. The first attempts at making cryogenic layers in these targets will also be discussed. These experiments are the first without fill tubes at LLNL. The primary technique used to create symmetrical layers of deuterium ice is infrared enhancement.
