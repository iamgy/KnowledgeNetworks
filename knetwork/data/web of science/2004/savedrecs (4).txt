J	Hiernaut, JP; Ronchi, C				Hiernaut, JP; Ronchi, C			Curium vaporization from (CM,Pu)(2)O-3 and from irradiated oxide fuel: Mass spectrometric measurement	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article								The equilibrium vapour pressure over a mixed curium oxide of type (Cm-244(0.76), Pu-240(1.24))O-3 was measured by Knudsen-effusion experiments. Plutonium was formed in the samples during 25 years decay of curium in an initial Cm2O3 sintered pellet. The same measurements were repeated on seven reactor-irradiated UO2 and MOX samples to obtain the vaporization enthalpy of curium present in typical spent nuclear fuel. The samples were annealed in a tungsten Knudsen cell up to 2800 K and the effusion rates of the different vapour components were analyzed on line by a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The vapour pressures of the curium-bearing species were accurately measured and the results compared with published data obtained under different conditions. The obtained results show that CmO(g) is the only effective vapour species and the measured equilibrium pressure confirms the trend observed in the actinide oxides that the high temperature volatility is more pronounced in compounds where the cation can easily attain a higher oxidation state than that of the condensed phase.

The measured conductivity values of all these oxides are of the order of 3-1 W K-1 m(-1) and are much less than that of UO2 over the entire temperature range of measurements. An increase of thermal conductivity with SrO/UO3 ratio is observed in these systems. The temperature dependence of the observed values of the thermal conductivity is explained using the mechanism for phonon mode of heat conduction. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Large precipitates were found in the 900 degreesC annealed ones with main difference in the number density among the alloys. Followed the heat treatments, the alloys were annealed again at 400-900 degreesC for 1 h or aged at 600-800 degreesC for durations up to 50 h. Precipitation hardening was found in solid solution treated alloys after the annealing below 900 degreesC and after the aging at 600 degreesC. The precipitates are Ti and C-rich ones, without the enrichment of W in the V-6W-4Ti alloy. Results showed that the growth of the precipitates was controlled by the diffusion of interstitial solutes of C, N and O. V-4Cr-4Ti showed much stronger precipitation hardening than the others due to Cr addition. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The main source of these particles are stellite alloys that are rich in cobalt and are used in primary cooling circuits in valves, pumps, etc. Due to either mechanical erosion or erosion coupled with corrosion under flow conditions (known as tribocorrosion), these stellite particles are released into the system. They are then activated by neutron absorption in the reactor core before being deposited on out-of-core surfaces, causing radiation exposure problems. In this paper, the possibility of dissolving stellite particles by using an oxidation-complexation process has been explored. Permanganate based reagents were evaluated for their efficiency in conditioning the stellite particles for their dissolution with organic acids. Permanganic acid was found to be the superior conditioning agent. Two alloys of stellite, viz. stellites #3 and #6, were studied with respect to their dissolution behavior. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The metallic solvents are expected to lower the U activity by several orders of magnitude owing to strong interactions among the metals. The reduction products are composed of the solvent metal matrix and intermetallic U compounds. Silicon is more effective in driving the reduction since there is no residual UO2 after the reaction. The gaseous product detected by mass spectrometer (MS) during the reduction is CO. A kinetic study for the Si case was accomplished by the stepwise isothermal analysis (SAI) method, leading to the identification of the controlling mechanisms as chemical reaction at the surface and nucleation, for U02 and U3O8 charges, respectively. One example for another system containing Al2O3 is also shown. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

X-ray, chemical and thermal analysis methods were used to characterise the products formed at various temperatures. The products obtained by heating two moles of K2S2O8 with one mole each of CeO2, PuO2, (U,Ce)O-2 and (U,Pu)O-2 at 400 degreesC were identified as K4Ce(SO4)(4), K4Pu(SO4)(4), K-4(U,Ce)(SO4)(4) and K-4(U,Pu)(SO4)(4), respectively. K4Ce(SO4)(4) further decomposed to form K4Ce(SO4)(3.5) at 600 degreesC and mixture of K2SO4 and CeO2 at 950 degreesC. Thus the products formed during the reaction of 2K(2)S(2)O(8) + CeO2 show that cerium undergoes changes in oxidation state from +4 to +3 and again to +4. XRD data of K4Ce(SO4)(4) and K4Ce(SO4)(3.5) were indexed on triclinic and monoclinic system, respectively. PuO2 + 2K(2)S(2)O(8) reacts at 400 degreesC to form K4Pu(SO4)(4) which was stable upto 750 degreesC and further decomposes to form K2SO4 + PuO2 at 1000 degreesC. The products formed at 400 degreesC during the reactions of the oxides and mixed oxides were found to be readily soluble in 1-2 M HNO3. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Haschke and V.M. Oversby	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Editorial Material							REDUCTION; PU(VI)	In part of a recent paper [J. Nucl. Mater. 305 (2002) 187] the authors examined the published data on the disproportionation of Pu(V) and the self-reduction of Pu(VI) in aqueous solution. They conclude that alpha particle-induced reduction of Pu(VI) is contrary to the experimental observations. It is shown here that, with the exception of results at pH 6, the authors have misinterpreted the published data. It is also demonstrated that the published data are in agreement with the generally accepted alpha-reduction mechanism. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Haschke, JA				Haschke, JA			Author's reply to "Comment on 'Plutonium chemistry: a synthesis of experimental data and a quantitative model for plutonium oxide solubility' by J.M. Haschke and V.M. Oversby"	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Editorial Material							PU(VI); DISPROPORTIONATION; HYDROLYSIS; REDUCTION; NP(VI)	In the accompanying letter, Newton and Hobart comment on a recent paper [J. Nucl. Mater. 305 (2002) 187] and conclude that a proposed alternative explanation for self-reduction of Pu(VI) is based on misinterpretation of data. Result of quantitative kinetic modeling contradicts this conclusion and the accepted explanation by showing that self-induced alpha-particle reduction of Pu-239(VI) at pH 1.5 does not account for the observed reduction rate of Pu(VI) or for dependence of the rate on [Pu(VI)]. Similar modeling shows that kinetic behavior is consistent with a self-reduction process based on disproportionation of Pu(VI). Validity of the alternative concept is supported by close similarities in the kinetic behavior of Pu(V) and Pu(VI). (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Decontamination tests were carried out using both simulated contaminated samples and pipe specimens cut from the primary coolant system of the Japan Power Demonstration Reactor. In the case of surface oxide layers consisting mainly of iron oxide, more than 99% of the radioactive contamination was removed after two to three decontamination runs. In order to ascertain the role of laser irradiation on chemical reactions, chemical states of O and Fe in the oxide layer before and after decontamination were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was found that the oxide layer was dissolved into the acid-containing gel, and this dissolution was extensively promoted by laser irradiation.

HTR-10 reached its first criticality successfully in December, 2000 and realized its full power operation in the beginning of 2003. Fabrication technology for HTR-10 spherical fuel element has been established and developed in INET through a lot of R&D activities during the past 20 years. A process known as total gelation process of uranium (TGU) has been developed to prepare UO2 kernel for HTR-10 fuel element in INET. The TGU process combined advantages of both external gelation and internal gelation method of conventional sol-gel process. The sol prescription consists of not only urea, polyvinylalcohol (PVA), tetrahydrofurfuyl alcohol (THFA), but also hexamethylene tetra-amine (HMTA) that is always employed in internal gelation process. The TGU process and facilities are described in this paper. Fuel kernel production for HTR-10 fuel element using this TGU process has completed up to April, 2002. This paper also reported the quality inspection data of kernel production.

J	Corrigall, RS; Martin, CJ; Watson, I				Corrigall, RS; Martin, CJ; Watson, I			Organisation of the disposal of radioactive sources from Scottish hospitals	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article								An amnesty for disposal of sealed radioactive sources from Scottish hospitals has been funded by the Scottish Executive to address problems arising from accumulation of sources. The contract was awarded to a company involved in radioactive source recycling. Coordination of uplifts from several hospitals allowed considerable financial savings to be made, so source amnesties could offer monetary advantages to Health and Education Departments elsewhere in the UK, as well as alleviating the problem from security and storage of sources that are no longer required. The sources originated in 14 hospitals, but were uplifted from five pick-up points. There were a total of 246 sources with 167 of these being caesium-137. The total activity was 16.2 TBq with one large 16.1 TBq blood irradiator source and the activities of all the other sources adding up to 167 GBq. This paper describes organisation of the collection. Options for achieving compliance with the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 are discussed, although in the event, special authorisations were obtained for each hospital. Arrangements for transport of the sources and source security were drawn up including emergency procedures for dealing with foreseeable incidents. The police provided secure overnight storage for the loaded truck and assistance in directing and monitoring progress of the load.

J	Veiga, LHS; Melo, V; Koifman, S; Amaral, ECS				Veiga, LHS; Melo, V; Koifman, S; Amaral, ECS			High radon exposure in a Brazilian underground coal mine	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article							INDUSTRIES; RN-222	The main source of radiation exposure in most underground mining operations is radon and radon decay products. The situation of radon exposure in underground mining in Brazil is still unknown, since there has been no national regulation regarding this exposure. A preliminary radiological survey in non-uranium mines in Brazil indicated that an underground coal mine in the south of Brazil had high radon concentration and needed to be better evaluated. This paper intends to present an assessment of radon and radon decay product exposure in the underground environment of this coal mining industry and to estimate the annual exposure to the workers. As a product of this assessment, it was found that average radon concentrations at all sampling campaign and excavation sites were above the action level range for workplaces of 500-1500 Bq m(-3) recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection-ICRP 65. The average effective dose estimated for the workers was almost 30 times higher than the world average dose for coal miners.

The K-L and K-M RRS measurements have been performed at the 59degrees and 133degrees angles, respectively, to avoid interference of the Compton-scatter peak. The Rayleigh and Compton scattering cross-sections for the 59.536 keV gamma-rays have also been measured at both the angles in the atomic region 1 less than or equal to Z less than or equal to 92. Measurements were performed using the reflection-mode geometrical arrangements involving the Am-241 radioisotope as photon source and planar Si(Li) and HPGe detectors. Ratios of the K-M and K-L RRS cross-sections in Yb, Lu and Hf are in general lower than that of the fluorescent Kbeta(1,3,5) (K-M) and Kalpha (K-L) X-ray transition probabilities. Theoretical Rayleigh scattering cross-sections based on the modified form-factors (MFs) corrected for the anomalous scattering factors (ASFs) and the S-matrix calculations are on an average similar to15% and similar to6% higher, respectively, at the 133degrees angle and exhibit good agreement with the measured data at the 59degrees angle. Larger deviations similar to30% and similar to20%, respectively, are observed at the 133degrees angle for the Gd-64, Dy-66, Ho-67 and Yb-70 elements having the K-shell binding energy in vicinity of the incident photon energy. The measured Compton scattering cross-sections are in general agreement with those calculated using the Klein-Nishina cross-sections and the incoherent scattering function. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA) performed on leached samples indicated a superficial hydration of LaYSiAlO glass of about 100-150 nm. This hydrated layer is (Al, Y)-enriched according to SEM-EDS analysis, suggesting the formation of hydroxide (or hydroxycarbonates) compounds including these two elements. This process leads to a very efficient passivation of the material due to the low solubility of Al and Y hydroxides (and hydroxycarbonates) species in near neutral media, even when the solution is rapidly replenished is dynamic leaching experiments. Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry elemental mapping revealed very localized and significantly Y-enriched deposits at the surface of the sample after leaching. This could be the sign of heterogeneities already present on the pristine glass. These may be correlated with the weak solubility of yttrium (and rare earth) elements in silicate matrices (Y + Ln initial content in the glass approximate to11 at.%). In the case of CeYSiAlO glass, a thin layer was formed on the solid after leaching. The simulation of the corresponding RBS spectra showed a surface (Y,Ce)enrichment and (Al, Si)-depletion in both cases. This could be explained by the oxidation of trivalent cerium initially present in the glass structure during leaching. This might be explained by the low solubility of Ce(IV)-compounds (CeO2 and/or Ce(OH)(4)) in solution leading to an enrichment of this element at the glass/solution interface, to form a mixture of amorphous CeO2 and Y(OH)(3), as confirmed by XPS and XRD experiments.

Multi-folded W mesh, W(1 0 0) single crystal foil and W polycrystalline foil samples have been investigated. It is found that the fast to slow conversion efficiency of the W mesh moderator depends on: (1) the annealing pretreatments, (2) the chemical etching duration and (3) the number of the folding layers. With the raw W mesh material having a wire diameter of 20 mum and transmission efficiency of 92.5%, an optimal efficiency of 1.2 x 10(-3) was achieved with 5 min etching duration and a folding number of 12 layers.

J	Appleby, PG; Piliposian, GT				Appleby, PG; Piliposian, GT			Efficiency corrections for variable sample height in well-type germanium gamma detectors	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						gamma spectrometry; well-type germanium detectors; efficiency calibration		In radiometric assay by gamma spectrometry using well-type detectors, sample sizes are in many cases insufficient to fill the sample holder to the full height at which the detector was calibrated. There is thus a need to determine the detection efficiency of the detector as a function of sample height. This paper considers a simple mathematical model for estimating this relation using a fairly small number of basic parameters characterising the detector. The model is tested empirically using a thin disk of UO3 placed at different heights in the sample holder. The empirical results show that the efficiency for such a disk placed at the top of a well is just 36% of the efficiency when placed at the bottom. The variations in relative efficiency with energy (over the range 63-1001 keV) are fairly small for disks placed near the bottom or top of the well, but significantly larger for disks at mid height. Although the modelled results broadly follow the same pattern as,the empirical results, there is a discrepancy that appears to be due to uncertainties in, the precise location of the crystal relative to the end cap, and also an effective dead layer at the front surface of the crystal possibly caused by forward scattering of higher energy photons emitted at a shallow angle to the front face of the detector following partial interactions. A corrected model that takes these into account is in excellent agreement with the empirical results. Calculations for different sized samples show that the nominal detector efficiency (excluding self-absorption) can vary with sample height by as much as 25%. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The goal of achieving a high power level to enhance economic performance simultaneously with adoption of passive decay heat removal and modularity capabilities resulted in designs in the range of 600-800 MW(thermal), which we classify as a medium power level compared to the lower [similar to100 MW(thermal)] and higher [2800 MW(thermal)] power ratings of other lead-alloy-cooled designs. The plant design that was developed shows promise of achieving all the Generation-IV goals for future nuclear energy systems: sustainable energy generation, low overnight capital cost, a very low likelihood and degree of core damage during any conceivable accident, and a proliferation-resistant fuel cycle. The reactor and fuel cycle designs that evolved to achieve these missions and goals resulted from study of the following key trade-offs: waste reduction versus reactor safety, waste reduction versus cost, and cost versus proliferation resistance. Secondary trade-offs that were also considered were monolithic versus modular design, active versus passive safety systems, forced versus natural circulation, alternative power conversion cycles, and lead versus lead-bismuth coolant. These studies led to a selection of a common modular design with forced convection cooling, passive decay heat removal, and a supercritical CO2 power cycle for all our reactor concepts. However, the concepts adopt different core designs to optimize the achievement of the two missions. For the low-cost electricity production mission, a design approach based on fueling with low enriched uranium operating without costly reprocessing in a once-through cycle was pursued to achieve a long operating cycle length by enhancing in-core breeding. For the actinide-burning mission three design variants were produced: (1) a fertile-free actinide burner, i.e., a single-tier strategy, (2) a minor actinide burner with plutonium burned in the LWR fleet, i.e., a two-tier strategy, and (3) an actinide burner with characteristics balanced to also favor economic electricity production.

Reduced cost is pursued through the use of (1) a modular design and maximum power rating to capitalize on an economy of scale within the constraints imposed by modularity, (2) a very compact and simple supercritical-CO2 power cycle, and (3) simplifications of the primary system allowed by the use of lead coolant. Excellent safety is pursued by adopting the integral fast reactor approach of achieving a self-controllable reactor that responds to all key abnormal occurrences, including anticipated transients without scrams, by a safe shutdown without exceeding core integrity limits. The three concepts developed are the fertile-free actinide burner for incineration of all transuranics from light water reactor (LWR) spent fuel, the fertile-free minor actinide (MA) burner for preferential burning of MAs working in tandem with LWRs or gas-cooled thermal reactors, and the actinide burner with thorium fuel aimed also at reducing the electricity generation costs through longer-cycle operation.

J	Hejzlar, P; Davis, CB				Hejzlar, P; Davis, CB			Performance of the lead-alloy-cooled reactor concept balanced for actinide burning and electricity production	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						actinide incineration; lead-cooled fast reactors; thorium fuel	BURNER REACTOR; BISMUTH; PHYSICS; FUEL	A lead-bismuth-cooled fast reactor concept targeted for a balanced mission of actinide burning and low-cost electricity production is proposed and its performance analyzed. The design explores the potential benefits of thorium-based fuel in actinide-burning cores, in particular in terms of the reduction of the large reactivity swing and enhancement of the small Doppler coefficient typical of fertile-free actinide burners. Reduced electricity production cost is pursued through a longer cycle length than that used for fertile-free burners and thus a higher capacity factor. It is shown that the concept can achieve a high transuranics destruction rate, which is only 20% lower than that of an accelerator driven system with fertile-free fuel. The small negative fuel temperature reactivity coefficient, small positive coolant temperature reactivity coefficient, and negative core radial expansion coefficient provide self-regulating characteristics so that the reactor is capable of inherent shutdown during major transients without scram, as in the Integral Fast Reactor. This is confirmed by thermal-hydraulic analysis of several transients without scram, including primary coolant pump trip, station blackout, and reactivity step insertion, which showed that the reactor was able to meet all identified thermal limits. However, the benefits of high actinide consumption and small reactivity swing can be attained only if the uranium from the discharged fuel is separated and not recycled. This additional uranium separation step and thorium reprocessing significantly increase the fuel cycle costs. Because the higher fuel cycle cost has a larger impact on the overall cost of electricity than the savings from the higher capacity factor afforded through use of thorium, this concept appears less promising than the fertile-free actinide burners.

J	Romano, A; Hejzlar, P; Todreas, NE				Romano, A; Hejzlar, P; Todreas, NE			Fertile-free fast lead-cooled incinerators for efficient actinide burning	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						actinide incineration; lead; fast reactor	REACTOR; PHYSICS; TRANSMUTATION; DESIGN	Fertile-free fast lead-cooled modular reactors are proposed as efficient incinerators of plutonium and minor actinides (MAs) for application to advanced fuel cycles devoted to transmutation. Two concepts are presented: (1) an actinide burner reactor, designed to incinerate mostly plutonium and some MAs, and(2) a minor actinide burner reactor, devoted to burning mostly minor actinides and some plutonium. These transuranics are loaded in a fertile-free Zr-based metallic fuel to maximize the incineration rate. Both designs feature streaming fuel assemblies that enhance neutron leakage to achieve favorable neutronic feedback and a double-entry control rod system that reduces reactivity perturbations during seismic events and flattens the axial power profile. A detailed neutronic analysis shows that both designs have favorable neutronic characteristics and reactivity feedback mechanisms that yield passive safety features comparable to those of the Integral Fast Reactor. A safety analysis presents the response of the burners to anticipated transients without scram on the basis of (1) the integral parameter approach and (2) simulations of thermal-hydraulic accident scenario conditions. It is shown that both designs have large thermal margins that lead to safe shutdown without structural damage to the core components for a large spectrum of unprotected transients. Furthermore, the actinide destruction rates are comparable to those of the accelerator transmutation of waste concept, and a fuel cycle cost analysis shows the potential for economical accomplishment of the transmutation mission compared to other proposed actinide-burning options.

J	Weaver, KD; Macdonald, PE				Weaver, KD; Macdonald, PE			A qualitative reactivity and isotopic assessment of fuels for lead-alloy-cooled fast reactors	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						fast reactors; nuclear fuel; heavy metal coolant		Various methods have been proposed to transmute and thus consume the current inventory of transuranic waste from spent light water reactor (LWR) fuel and plutonium from weapons. We discuss the neutronics performance of nonfertile, fertile metallic, and fertile nitride fuels loaded with 20 to 30 wt% LWR-grade plutonium plus minor actinides and burned in an open-lattice lead-alloy-cooled fast reactor, with an emphasis on the fuel cycle life and spent fuel isotopic content. As a comparison, similar fuel was also studied in a sodium cooled fast reactor. Our calculations show that the average actinide burn rate for fertile-free fuel is similar for both the sodium- and lead-bismuth-cooled cases, ranging from 1.02 to 1.16 g/MWd, compared to a typical LWR actinide generation rate of 0.303 g/MWd. In addition, our calculations show that the effective full-power days (EFPDs) of operation (or equivalent reactivity-limited burnup) using fertile fuel can extend beyond 20 yr, and the average actinide burn rate is similar for both the sodium- and lead-bismuth-cooled cases, ranging from 0.5 to 0.9 g/MWd. Using the same parameters (i.e., a large pitch-to-diameter ratio, same linear power, and fissile/fertile loading, etc.), the lead-alloy-cooled cases had an EFPD that was 18% to several times greater than their sodium-cooled counterparts. However, tight sodium-cooled lattices are equivalent to the looser lead-alloy lattices in terms Of beginning-of-life excess reactivity.

Their low sputtering yields under the impact of charge exchange atoms can guarantee long-term mirror operation. An important factor influencing the rate of mirror degradation and reproducibility of results is the structure of its material: monocrystal W and Mo mirrors fabricated of the densest face (110) are shown to have the best characteristic. After mechanical treatment (in the process of monocrystal mirror fabrication), Mo (111) degrades noticeably faster than a perfect monocrystal. The lowest resistance was shown by mirrors fabricated of rolled sheet TZM alloy. The difference in the dependences of reflectance behavior on sputtered depth is explained by microrelief development due to sputtering erosion. In simulation experiments, the sputtering yield was not the only factor influencing the rate of reflectance degradation under bombardment by ions of deuterium plasma. For mirror test data to be reproducible, the material has to be certified; and special precautions should be taken when fabricating mirrors.

The setup consists of two neutral particle analysers, LENPA (for energy range of 10-200 keV) and HENPA (for range of 0.1-4 MeV). LENPA is intended for control of isotope ratio of the plasma hydrogen component by measuring an intensity ratio of hydrogen/deuterium/tritium fluxes. It will be incorporated into a system controlling the plasma isotope composition. HENPA is assumed to analyse He atom fluxes to study the fusion alpha particle distribution function. The analysers are located in the protecting vacuum container and are connected with ITER plasma vessel by a beam line. A suggested design of the beam line is described. a pressure distribution along the beam line is calculated, influence of collisions of neutral atoms with the working gas molecules on spectra of atoms is estimated. The design of the analysers will be described shortly.

As the use of fumigants and preservatives for herbs is being restricted, safe hygienic technologies are demanded. To consider the possibility of the application of irradiation technology for this purpose, the genotoxicological safety and stability of the active components of the gamma-irradiated Paeoniae Radix were studied. The herb was irradiated with gamma-rays at a practical dosage of 10 kGy, and then it was extracted with hot water. The genotoxicity of the extract of the irradiated herb was examined in two short-term in vitro tests: (1) Ames test in Salmonella typhimurium; (2) Micronucleus test in cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The extract of the irradiated herb did not show mutagenicity in the Ames test of the Salmonella reverse mutation assay, and did not show cytogenetic toxicity in the culture of the CHO cells. HPLC chromatogram of paeoniflorin. in the irradiated Paeoniae Radix was similar with that of the non-irradiated sample. The quantity of paeoniflorin did not change significantly with irradiation. These results suggest that gamma-irradiated Paeoniae Radix is toxicologically safe and chemically stable. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The graft polymerization and subsequent chemical treatment can introduce a chelate agent function into a conventional polymer such as polyethylene. The obtained amidoxime fibrous adsorbent was applied to the recovery of uranium from seawater. Soaking of 350 kg adsorbent 12 times in seawater led to the collection of 1 kg of uranium. Natural polymers such as derivatives of starch and cellulose were radiation-crosslinked to form hydrogels. Mats of crosslinked carboxylmethyl cellulose were evaluated by 68 patients after surgical operation. No bedsore was observed in almost of all patients after operation. This product was commercialized as "Non-bedsore" in Japan. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Not only is the level of investment daunting but also, to be sure of comparing like with like, the evaluator requires a basic understanding of the science underpinning radiation processing. There have been many papers published that provide technical specialists with a rigorous interpretation of this science (In: Gaughran, E.R.L., Goudie, AJ. (Eds.), Technical Developments and Prospects of Sterilization by Ionizing Radiation, International Conference, Vienna. Multiscience Publications Ltd., pp. 145-172), The objective for this paper is to give non-specialists an introduction to the language of radiation processing and to clarify some of the terminology associated with the use of radioactive sources for this application.

Many areas of the Radiation Processing Industry are affected by changes in the regulatory framework within which these areas are managed. When planning for such changes the transportation element in the shipment of sealed cobalt radiation sources is an area that is often neglected by some parts of the distribution chain. A balance must be struck between the cobalt supplier and the facility operator/customer that rests upon how much the customer needs to know about the intricacies of cobalt shipment. The objective of this paper is to highlight areas of possible business impact and reassure the users of sealed radiation sources that the global suppliers of these products are used to negotiating local variations in regulations governing the physical transportation of radiation sources, changes in regulations governing the design, manufacture and use of transportation containers and changes in the availability of commercial shippers and shipping routes. The major suppliers of industrial quantities of cobalt-60 are well placed to lead their customers through this complex process as a matter of routine. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

One aspect that has received attention is the radiological dispersal device ("dirty bomb"), in particular the possibility of obtaining radioactive material for producing such devices. As a result, the security of US gamma irradiators has been the focus of industry efforts to reinforce protection of high-activity sources. This paper presents approaches that may be used to improve security at gamma irradiation facilities, including increased vigilance, education and awareness, and physical changes to the facility. As each method has been or is being implemented, employee involvement is a critical factor to success. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The space required for this storage, and the time needed, are small relative to the needs of the power reactor industry. All aspects of this process are well established and licensed by regulatory agencies. There have been no accidents related to this activity that are known to the author. Accidents have occurred related to other applications of sealed sources; the causes of these are discussed and found to be unrelated to the industrial irradiator application. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Schrodinger cat-like states exhibit two spatially separated regions which are occupied by the neutron at the same time. When used in scattering experiments this enables a direct observation of the local structure and dynamics of matter. A proper description can be obtained by means of Wigner quasi-distribution functions which are common in quantum optics. More complicated quasi-distribution functions have been verified recently by means of a double loop interferometer. These quantum states have the capacity to observe even higher-order correlation functions characterizing condensed matter. The non-local character of quantum theory has also been demonstrated in the behavior of neutrons within narrow slits where typical confinement effects have been observed. Such Casimir-like and Zeno-like phenomena show how neutrons are an attractive tool for quantum optical experiments opening new possibilities of neutron phase space manipulations. A proper treatment of the neutron field can enhance the available neutron intensities considerably. First cooling to ultra-cold neutron energies by cold solid deuterium moderators increases the phase space density, which can be transferred to higher energies by a proper phase space transformer consisting of fast rotating multi-layer mirrors or crystals. Various proposals in this directions will be discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The RD was first proposed in the 1980s and was recently brought to a performance level exceeding conventional neutron-sensitive Li-glass scintillator detectors. It features a photon counter coupled to a neutron analyzer foil. Resonant neutron adsorption in the foil results in the emission of prompt gamma rays that are detected in the photon counter. The dimensions of the RD set the construction of detector arrays geometry. The main results of the research on this kind of detector are reported leading to the present optimized RD design based on a combination of YAP scintillation photon counter and uranium or gold analyzer foils. This detector has already been selected for application in the upgrade of the VESUVIO spectrometer on ISIS. A special application is the Very Low Angle Detector (VLAD) bank, which will extend the kinematical region for neuron scattering to low momentum transfer (<10 Angstrom(-1)) whilst still keeping energy transfer > 1 eV, thus allowing new experimental studies in condensed matter systems. The first results of the tests made with prototype VLAD detectors are presented, confirming the usefulness of the RD for measurements at the scattering angles as low as 2-5degrees.

The films were investigated in-situ by ultraviolet and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS and XPS, respectively). Special interest was put on the evolution of the electronic structure with the composition of the films, as deduced from the U-4f, C-1s and valence region spectra. With increasing carbon content, three types of carbon species were detected according to C-1s core level line, at 282, 282.6 and 284.5 eV binding energy (BE). They are attributed to the UC, UC2 and graphite phases, respectively. The U-4f core levels do not change strongly with increasing carbon content, showing well-itinerant U-5f electrons. Similarly, valence region spectra show three types of carbon species for different UCx films, which are differentiated by their C-2p signals. A strong hybridisation between C-2p and U-5f states is detected in UC, while the C-2p signal in UC2 appears only weakly hybridised, and for higher carbon contents a pi band characteristic of graphite appears.

The experiments were performed in the temperature interval 74-100 degreesC. In addition, the suggested catalytic activity of UO2 on the reduction of UO22+ by H-2 was investigated. The results clearly show that H-2 is capable of reducing UO22+ to UO2 without the presence of a catalyst. The reaction is of first order with respect to UO22+. The activation energy for the process is 130 +/- 24 U mol(-1) and the rate constant is k(298K) = 3.6 x 10(-9) l mol(-1) s(-1). The activation enthalpy and entropy for the process was determined to 126 kJ mol(-1) and 16.5 J mol(-1) K-1, respectively. Traces of oxygen were shown to inhibit the reduction process. Hence, the suggested catalytic activity of freshly precipitated U02 on the reduction of UO22+ by H-2 could not be confirmed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Khan, MJ; Aslam; Ahmad, N				Khan, MJ; Aslam; Ahmad, N			Neutronics analyses of natural uranium fueled, light water cooled, heavy water moderated and graphite reflected nuclear reactors	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								The work presented in this paper was conducted to validate the computer codes such as WIMS-D/4 and CITATION for the criticality analyses of natural uranium fueled, light water cooled, heavy water moderated and graphite reflected reactors such as National Experimental Reactor (NRX) and Canadian Indian Reactor (CIR). These codes are then used to search a proliferation resistant reactor core. It was found that the replacement of light water coolant with heavy water and with increased moderation, the core can be operated at a power level of less than half as compared to the power level of NRX/CIR but the neutron flux will remain unaffected. This core will be smaller in size and therefore there will be savings in required quantities of D2O, graphite and fuel. It will produce much less plutonium with higher concentration of Pu-240, if the burnup is more than 2800 MWD/T. Furthermore, it was found that the void coefficient of the coolant will be less positive and therefore the system will be more safe as compared to original NRX/CIR design. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Rahman, M; Mandal, MAW; Alam, B; Takano, H				Rahman, M; Mandal, MAW; Alam, B; Takano, H			Validation study of the cell code WIMS-D and a 69 group library based on JENDL-3.2	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								A new 69-group library of multigroup constants for the lattice code WIMS-D/4 has been generated, processing nuclear data from JENDL-3.2 using NJOY91.108. A parallel ENDF/ B-VI based library has also been constructed for inter-comparison of results. Benchmark calculations for a number of thermal reactor critical assemblies having both uranium and plutonium fuels have been performed with the code WIMS-D/4.1 with three different libraries: the 1986 WIMS library (NEA-0329/10) and the new JENDL-3.2 and ENDF/B-VI based libraries. The benchmark parameters calculated with the two new libraries show similar tendencies and are found in better agreement with the experimental values compared to those with the 1986 WIMS library. Benchmark parameters are further calculated with the comprehensive lattice code SRAC95. The results from WIMS-D/4.1 and SRAC95 agree well with each other as well as to the other previously published values except for lattices with higher plutonium contents. The disagreement is well resolved by an improved resonance treatment and ended up with a clear indication that the 1986 WIMS library with 13-resonance groups is not at all reliable for analysis of mixed oxide (MOX) cores of varying plutonium contents and for burn-up calculation of uranium-fueled cores.

Both single gamma-ray spectra as well as gamma-ray spectra gated by anti-cosmic shielding made of plastic scintillators are presented. The advantages of anticosmic shielding for HPGe detectors, especially in underground counting laboratories operating at shallow depths, are discussed. The authors present several examples of analysis of radionuclides in marine samples by single gamma-ray spectrometers with anti-cosmic shielding, an anti-Compton spectrometer and a Ge-Ge telescope designed for the analysis of low energy gamma-emitters.

However, the extent of tailing of alpha particle peaks into regions of lower energy is often a critical factor for accurate spectral analysis, particularly given the relatively low count rates observed for many environmental samples. In this paper we examine the influence of various factors on peak resolution and tailing for spectra collected using solid-state alpha detectors, in particular chamber gas pressure and source deposit thickness.
