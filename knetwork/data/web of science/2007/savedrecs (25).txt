The benefits of loading available and upcoming higher density fuels in the existing PARR-1 core have been explored in this study with constraints of no change in the existing moderator/coolant channel width and existing reactor systems. The study was conducted by employing the standard reactor physics simulation codes WIMS-D/4, CITATION, and burnup analyses code FCAP along with a reactor thermal hydraulics simulation code PARET. The study reveals that by directly replacing the fuel currently in use in PARR-I core with a similar type of fuel of density 4.8 gU/cm(3), an equilibrium core slightly smaller than the existing equilibrium core of PARR-I can be established. The new equilibrium core can provide neutron fluxes similar to those that are available in the existing equilibrium core of PARR-I but will require about 14.4 kg less LEU fuel for its one effective full power year operation at 10 MW. Size of this new equilibrium core can be reduced to achieve about 47% higher thermal neutron fluxes at the irradiation sites without increasing the existing cost of producing neutron fluxes. In case of new cores, fuel cycle length is also six effective full power days (EFPDs) larger than that of the existing equilibrium core. Thermal hydraulic analysis results show that these suggested cores can be operated safely at 10 MW with the existing coolant flow rate of 1000 m(3)/h. The study was further extended by considering direct substitution of higher density fuels, being developed under the RERTR program, in the proposed core. This extended study revealed that the utilization of further higher density fuels being developed under the RERTR program is not feasible from the viewpoint of relative production cost of neutron flux.

J	Lim, JY; Kim, MH				Lim, Jae-Yong; Kim, Myung-Hyun			A new LFR design concept for effective TRU transmutation	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						LFR; transmutation; conceptual design; proliferation resistance		One of the lead-alloy cooled fast reactors, PEACER (Proliferation-resistant, Environment-friendly, Accident-tolerant, Continuable-energy, and Economical Reactor), has been designed by a university research team in Korea. This reactor is a medium-size modular fast reactor of 850 MWt (300 MWe) rated power with lead-bismuth coolant loop. A square lattice fuel assembly with large pitch size might be favorable to ensure sufficient mass flow rate not only in normal operation but also in natural cooling under accidents. A metal fuel of (U,TRU) 10%Zr is chosen in this study for the advantage of high thermal conductivity. Multinational energy complex with a closed fuel cycle facilities should provide proliferation resistance with an institutional barrier. Under the material control safeguards, all fuel isotopes and radioactive material should be confined in a complex but as low-level radioactive waste. In order to achieve this goal, efficient transmutation of long-lived minor actinides (LLMAs) and long-lived fission products (LLFPs) should be completed in an LFR core. An energy complex, PEACER-Park, consists of four PEACERs and two collocated pyro-processing plants. Only low-level waste from spent fuel reprocessing plant is designed to be transported out of PEACER-Park. Recovery factors in reprocessing plant, therefore, should be high enough to make low-level tail satisfy US NRC class C classification. However, an interim storage should be collocated in PEACER-Park for storing radioactive fission products having short half-life such as Cs-135 and Sr-90. Parametric studies have been done for a core design to maximize its transmutation capability within safety criteria. When a pitch to diameter ratio (PID ratio) was increased, the transmutation capability of each LLMA isotope changed in different ways. When neutron leakage was increased by making core shape flat, the transmutation enhanced. It was confirmed that longer cycle length was favorable to transmutation. In the case of feed fuel composition and coolant operation temperature, there were no significant effects on transmutation performance. The final optimized core was designed as follows: a flat core shape with 50 cm of active core height and 5 m core diameter, pitch to diameter ratio of 2.2 which could be compromised between different transmutation tendencies of Np-237 and Am-241 and three different enrichment zones with 1-year cycle length. This design could achieve a sufficient transmutation capability with a support ratio of 2.085. Maximum pin power peaking was less than 1.5. Large negative radial expansion feedback coefficient and a sufficient shutdown margin could also be guaranteed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ahmed, R; Aslam; Ahmad, N; Khan, MJ; Tanvir, M				Ahmed, Rizwan; Aslam; Ahmad, Nasir; Khan, Mohammad Javed; Tanvir, Mujahid			Utilization of high-density fuel and beryllium elements for the neutron flux enhancement in typical MTR type research reactors	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						reactivity; fuel loading; performance	PAKISTAN RESEARCH REACTOR-1; ENERGY-SPECTRUM; CRITICALITY	Pakistan Research Reactor-1 (PARR-1) is atypical MTR type swimming pool reactor utilizing low enriched uranium (LEU), i.e. 19.99% enriched in U-235, silicide dispersion fuel of density 3.28 gU/cm(3). This simulation study was conducted by employing the standard reactor physics simulation codes WIMS-D/4, CITATION, and a burnup analysis code FCAP along with a reactor thermal hydraulic simulation code PARET. The present study shows that by directly substituting LEU silicide dispersion fuel of density 4.8 gU/cm3 in place of fuel currently in use in PARR-1 and by loading beryllium elements at the unused 9 x 6 position of PARR-1 grid plate, a smaller equilibrium core can be designed that can provide 82% higher neutron fluxes at the central flux trap position at 14% lower cost than the existing core. Fuel cycle length of this core is also two days larger than the existing core and this core can be operated safely at the existing power of 10 MW with the existing coolant flow rate of 1000 m 3/h. A possible use of LEU U-Mo monolithic fuel of density 15.3 gU/CM3 with some adjustment in fuel to moderator ratio and use of Be reflector would provide 89% higher neutron flux in PARR-1 at 29% lower cost. Fuel cycle length of this core will be five days shorter than the existing core and it will require 48% more coolant flow rate for its safe operation at 10 MW. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Lee, CM; Lee, K				Lee, Chang Min; Lee, KunJai			A study on operation time periods of spent fuel interim storage facilities in South Korea	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						at-reactor storage; away-from reactor storage; interim storage; saturation time; storage capacity; share of nuclear energy		The saturation of South Korea's at-reactor (AR) spent fuel storage pools has created a necessity for additional spent fuel storage capacity. Because the South Korean government has a plan to increase the number of nuclear power plants to 27 units by 2015, the increase of spent nuclear fuel generation will be accelerated. Because there is no clear national plan for spent nuclear fuel permanent disposal, the Korea Hydraulic Nuclear Power Company is planning to construct a spent fuel interim storage facility with 11,000 tHM capacity for Pressure Water Reactor (PWR). This study estimates the operation time periods of interim storage facilities with regard to the re-racking plan of spent fuel storage pools and construction of new nuclear power plants. To do this, the amount of spent fuel generation was estimated through a nuclear power supply plan until the year 2015. After 2015 year, the amount of spent fuel generation was estimated by using three scenarios that this study assumes according to variation of number of nuclear power plants: the "discontinue scenario", the "maintenance scenario", and the "increase scenario". In the case of the "increase scenario", projections of the share of nuclear power were estimated using the MESSAGE-V method. It is estimated that an interim storage facility will be needed by 2016, and for all scenarios, it is estimated that interim spent storage facilities will be saturated by 2041 with current burnup and by 2049 with extended burnup. In order to get a more meaningful result, it is recommended that a study on the practical storage facility capacity with respect to the risk assessment, public acceptance and further research should follow.

J	Yu, JY; Wang, ST; Jia, BS				Yu Jiyang; Wang Songtao; Jia Baoshan			Development of sub-channel analysis code for CANDU-SCWR	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						sub-channel; SCWR; CANDU; ASSERT-PV	HEAT-TRANSFER; REACTORS	The paper presents the development of a sub-channel thermal-hydraulic analysis code named SUBCHAN. The code was originally developed to analyze super critical CANDU type reactor which has such characters as horizontal fuel channels, heavy water moderated, super critical light water cooled, any type of fuel bundle with or without thorium rods. Thermal-hydraulic model of SUBCHAN is based on four partial differential equations that describe the conservation of mass, energy and momentum vector in axial and lateral directions for the water liquid/vapor mixture. The heat transfer correlations and pressure drop correlations used in the SUBCHAN code are presented in this paper. The water properties package of the code is based on the Industrial Formulation 1997 for the Thermodynamic Properties of Water and Steam. The heat transfer correlation of super critical region is based on the experimental investigation of Xi'an Jiaotong University and Dyadyakin and Popov correlation. By calculating the TACR case, which is operating at 12.5 MPa pressure, compared with the results of ASSERT-PV code, the paper gets the conclusion that the development of the SUBCHAN code with super critical water property package is successful. Then the paper uses the SUBCHAN code to analyze CANDU-SCWR which is operating at 25.0 MPa pressure. The paper gets the conclusion that the SUBCHAN code can be used to analyze the steady state sub-channel thermal-hydraulic analysis of CANDU-SCWR fuel channel. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The use of a soaking procedure combined with the sintering process to reach a high cerium content in a cerium-bearing Y-britholite	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Y-britholite; sintering; soaking; leaching; XRD; EDX	LONG-LIVED RADIONUCLIDES; TETRAVALENT ACTINIDES; NUCLEAR-WASTE; SOLUBILITY; CERAMICS; APATITE; IMMOBILIZATION; IRRADIATION; BEHAVIOR; URANIUM	A Y-britholite loaded with Ce, with the chemical composition (19.12% SiO(2), 7.53% P(2)O(5), 15.87% CaO, 46.77% Y(2)O(3), 0.67% CaF(2), 0.95% H(2)O, 9.09% CeO(2)) was synthesized by two methods: a dry route and a combined route of natural sintering/soaking procedure. In the first synthesis method, all the milled reagents are pressed in pellets at 340 MPa and then sintered for 20 h in air at 1473 K. In the second method, the Ce-free mineral was first obtained by the dry route described above. Then, it was unfiltered by a cerium nitrate solution to incorporate Cc in the Y-britholite crystalline structure. The powder is calcined at 1223 K and sintered in air at 1473 K for 20 It. These last two steps are repeated twice to allow a good incorporation of Ce in the material, as well as reaching a good homogeneity of the mineral. A physical characterization of the materials coming from the two synthesis methods, by both XRD and EDX analyses, gives a total Ce incorporation into the mineral obtained by the combined dry/wet synthesis process, namely 7.40 wt.%, against a 5 wt.% of Ce incorporation rate in the Y-britholite obtained by the dry route process. The XRD analysis identified crystalline phases were a major hexagonal crystalline phase of Y-britholite in both Y-britholites. To assess the chemical durability of the synthesized minerals, a water static]each test was performed at 298 K for the dry way obtained Y-britholite, and at 298, 323 and 363 K for the dry/wet way obtained Y-britholite. The tests were based on the release of cerium in water. UV analysis was used to follow the evolution of Ce concentrations in the leachates. The Ce mean diffusion coefficients were of the order of magnitude of 10(-7) m(2)s(-1), and the mineral water altered layers were lower than 220 mu m (22 x 10(-5) m). This demonstrated the superficial phenomenon of leaching. The diffusional model of leaching was validated, proving the chemical durability of the mineral, even at high leaching temperatures for the dry/wet way obtained Y-britholite. This synthesis method has proved the possibility to confine higher amounts of Ce, an actinide surrogate, into the crystal of Y-britholite, with the combined synthesis method of sintering/soaking procedure, compared with the dry route of synthesis.

J	Rempe, NT				Rempe, Norbert T.			Permanent underground repositories for radioactive waste	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Review						radioactive waste; permanent isolation; underground repositories; analogues; disposal experience		Solid radioactive waste first entered a deep geologic repository in 1959. Liquid radioactive waste has been injected into confined underground reservoirs since 1963. Solid wastes containing chemically toxic constituents with infinite half lives have been isolated underground since 1972. Performance to date of these and other repositories has not caused any of their owners and operators to transfer or contemplate transferring the waste confined in them to presumably safer locations. Natural and engineered analogues offer sound evidence that deep geologic isolation is effective, safe, and compatible with responsible environmental stewardship. Under-round isolation of dangerous, including radioactive, wastes is therefore increasingly being used as a safe and reliable method of final disposal. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

With this perception, the so-called SWOT analysis is employed to identify the internal strengths (S) and/or weaknesses (W) of nuclear energy when compared with other energy competitors on the basis of an evaluation of the external factors which are likely to play the roles of opportunities (0) for and/or threats (T) against the technological changes in nuclear energy. Out of the external environmental factors, electrification, the regulations for the global environments and the limited availability of fossil fuels are analyzed to provide an opportunity for the nuclear energy innovation in the future. The changes of consumption behavior and the liberation of the marketplace are classified as threat factors. But urbanization, an accelerated technological development and an increased attention to the environment are expected to work either as opportunity factors or threat factors while depending on the innovations of nuclear technology. Such internal factors as the recycling ability of nuclear fuels, high energy density and little emission of greenhouse gases are counted as the strengths of nuclear power, while some weak points for its role in a future society are found both in its social situations such as the management of radioactive waste, safety and nuclear proliferation and in its structure of high capital costs.

Current status on the nuclear back-end fuel cycle R&D in Korea	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						nuclear reactor; spent nuclear fuel (SNF); Korean nuclear industries		Nuclear energy in Korea has provided a stable and economical supply of electricity since its first commercial implementation in 1978. Presently, 20 nuclear reactors are in operation, four are under construction, and by 2017, a total of 28 nuclear reactors will be in operation with a nuclear share of 46.7%. An active nuclear energy program is the key to a sustainable economic growth while preserving the natural environment. Unfortunately, an active nuclear program also generates inevitable byproducts, such as low-level radioactive wastes and spent nuclear fuel (SNF). Therefore, a reliable and effective management of this radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel in association with. the introduction of next generation GEN-IV reactors has become an important challenge to nuclear energy. Korean nuclear industries, R&D institutes, and regulatory bodies with strong support from the Government are working hard to overcome this challenge. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Ceteris paribus, it is found that approximately 13% of the unit manufacturing cost based oil an industrial engineering estimation was cheaper than that of the account classification method. The unit manufacturing cost of a PWR canister was estimated to be 163,586 EUR by using an industrial engineering estimation. According to the conceptual Korean reference design, for the PWR, 11,375 canisters and for the CANDU, 2835 canisters will be needed to dispose of the spent fuels of 36,000 tU, so the manufacturing costs of the canisters would be about 32% of the total disposal cost. Hence, the manufacturing cost of the canisters for spent fuels is the most dominant cost driver for the overall disposal costs. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Kim, S. K.; Chun, K.

The management of separated plutonium: An introduction	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Editorial Material						plutonium; radioactive waste; nuclear fuels		This paper notes renewed enthusiasm in western countries for new nuclear power plant construction. Various energy and security challenges, however, remain contentious. One matter for which there is a wide variation of international practice concerns the management of separated plutonium arising from nuclear fuel reprocessing. This paper introduces a special issue of the journal Progress in Nuclear Energy dedicated to reporting on a conference held in Cambridge, England in July 2005. The workshop was tasked with considering long-term management options for separated civil plutonium. The authors express no opinion as to whether such plutonium is best regarded as a waste or an asset. Rather it is simply suggested that management practice may be improved via an open discussion of options originating from a wide range of contexts and perspectives. This paper introduces some of the relevant issues, which are considered in greater depth by the papers that follow in this special issue. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Countries which have opted for reprocessing of spent fuel have had to contend with increasing inventories of separated plutonium. Of the various potential options for utilisation or disposition of these stockpiles, only light water reactor (LWR) mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel programmes are sufficiently technologically mature to be fully operational in several European countries at present. Such reprocessing-recycling programmes allow for a stabilisation of the overall separated plutonium stocks, but not for a significant reduction in the stockpile. Moreover, the quality of recycled plutonium decreases at each potential step of re-irradiation. Therefore, optimised or new ways of managing the plutonium stocks in the medium to long term are required. In the present overview we consider the most promising options for reactor utilisation of plutonium in both near-term future reactor and Generation IV systems. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Each of the six selected Generation IV systems [very high temperature reactor (VHTR), gas-cooled fast reactor (GFR), sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR), super-critical-water-cooled reactor (SCWR), lead-cooled fast reactor (LFR), molten salt reactor (MSR)] is briefly discussed. The main characteristics of each system are summarised and the capability for plutonium management indicated. The potential for the management of plutonium using Generation IV systems is briefly reviewed from a complete fuel cycle perspective to illustrate the issues in the context of a fleet of reactor and fuel cycle facilities.

So far, the only long-term strategy seriously considered is geological repository for several hundred thousand years. Transmutation is an option significantly reducing the time during which repositories have to be sealed, simplifying the task of protecting future generations from the radioactive remnants of our civilisation. This paper gives an overview of motives and priorities, and describes the main technique suggested for transmutation of nuclear waste. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Plutonium management with thorium-based fuels and inert matrix fuels in thermal reactor systems	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Research Workshop on Progress in Nuclear Energy	JUL, 2005	Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, ENGLAND		Univ Cambridge	nuclear fuel; plutonium; thorium; inert matrix fuel; transmutation	OXIDE FUELS; FABRICATION; ZIRCONIA; LWRS	The plutonium that is produced by light water reactors worldwide is currently re-used to a limited extent. In the last century, the expected introduction of fast reactors and the associated need for large amounts of plutonium did not take place. The result is that worldwide a stockpile of excess plutonium has formed, which is the dominant contributor to the radiotoxicity of spent nuclear fuel for storage times from similar to 10(2) to 10(5) years. One option to reduce or stabilize the plutonium stockpile is to utilize this plutonium in advanced fuel types, such as thorium-based and inert matrix fuels. Because these fuels do not contain uranium, the plutonium consumption rate is very high. In this paper, the status of the fuel research and some recent developments are given.

Plutonium solubility and self-irradiation effects in borosilicate glass	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Research Workshop on Progress in Nuclear Energy	JUL, 2005	Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, ENGLAND		Univ Cambridge	borosilicate glass; actinides; self-irradiation; plutonium solubility; macroscopic properties; dissolution rate	NUCLEAR WASTE; ACTINIDE VALENCES; IMMOBILIZATION; DISPOSITION; FORMS	This article presents the limitations for the immobilization of plutonium in borosilicate glasses. A first one is related to the solubility of this element in glass. The effects of the temperature and redox conditions during glass processing were studied. Glass specimens containing plutonium and plutonium surrogates are fabricated. The results show that trivalent elements (La, Gd, Nd, etc.) exhibit greater solubility than tetravalent elements (Pu, Th, Hf). Fabricating the plutonium-doped glass samples under reductive conditions reduced the Pu to trivalent oxidation state and increased its solubility to 4 wt% PUO2 without reaching the solubility limit. A structural approach based on the results of EXAFS and NMR spectroscopy suggests that the structural role of the trivalent and tetravalent elements corresponds to that of intermediate network modifiers and intermediate network formers, respectively. The second factor is the effect of actinide decay on the long-term behavior of the glass. Borosilicate glass samples were doped with different curium contents (0.05, 0.5, 1.5 and 4.1 wt% of CmO2). The macroscopic properties (density, microhardness and initial dissolution rate) of the glasses were characterized up to 4 x 10(18) alpha g(-1). No significant effect on the initial alteration rate was detected. The glass swelled slightly, saturating at about 0.5% after receiving a dose of about 2 x 10(18) alpha g(-1). Further studies are ongoing to confirm the satisfactory long-term behavior of the borosilicate glass matrix at higher doses, and to determine the solubility limit of plutonium in reducing conditions.

Ceramic matrices for plutonium disposition	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Research Workshop on Progress in Nuclear Energy	JUL, 2005	Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, ENGLAND		Univ Cambridge	plutonium; neptunium; minor actinides; nuclear waste form; pyrochlore; zircon	NUCLEAR-WASTE FORMS; BEAM-INDUCED AMORPHIZATION; EXCESS WEAPONS PLUTONIUM; ALPHA-DECAY DAMAGE; RADIATION-DAMAGE; ION-BEAM; PYROCHLORE GROUP; SOLID-SOLUTIONS; IMMOBILIZATION; ACTINIDES	One of the major issues related to the expanded use of nuclear power and the development of advanced nuclear fuel cycles is the fate of plutonium and "minor" actinides. In addition, substantial quantities of plutonium and highly enriched uranium from dismantled nuclear weapons now require disposition. There are two basic strategies for the disposition of the actinides: (1) to "burn" or transmute the actinides using nuclear reactors or accelerators; (2) to "sequester" the actinides in chemically durable, radiation-resistant materials that are suitable for geologic disposal. This paper deals with actinide-bearing materials that support the latter approach. During the past two decades, a considerable amount of research and development has been done in an effort to develop matrices for the immobilization of plutonium and the "minor actinides", Np, Am and Cm. A variety of waste form materials oxides, silicates and phosphates - have been developed that have a high capacity for the incorporation of actinides, are chemically durable and, in some cases, resistant to the radiation-induced transformation to the aperiodic state. These waste forms can be selected depending on the composition of the waste stream that contains the actinides, the desired materials' properties of the waste form, and the geochemical and hydrologic conditions of the specific repository. The present state-of-knowledge for these materials is such that now one can design materials for very specific conditions, such as the thermal history and accumulated radiation dose, in a repository.

This paper suggests a timely, cost-effective solution for managing this material: storage MOX. A storage MOX plan would use existing MOX fuel fabrication facilities to make a simple MOX waste form suitable for long-term storage. Alternative waste forms to MOX are also possible, such as zirconia and pyrochlore, which provide more reliable durability and radiation damage control over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years.

J	Ahmad, F				Ahmad, Fawzia			Impact of fertilizers on background radioactivity level in two newly developed desert areas	RADIATION EFFECTS AND DEFECTS IN SOLIDS			English	Article						gamma-spectroscopy; fertilizers; natural radioactivity; dose; environmental	NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; BUILDING-MATERIALS	A survey of soils and plants was carried out to determine the environmental gamma background radiation levels in two newly developed desert areas. The materials and the standards were analyzed by gamma spectroscopy; a shielded high purity germanium detector was used to measure the natural concentration of U-238, Th-232 and K-40 activities in the samples. The radionuclide content in some commercial fertilizers was determined. The results of the analysis of specific activities in the fertilizers under study were 1.27-950.09 Bq/kg for U-238, 0.73-162.16 Bq/kg for Th-232 and 10.22-23845.24 Bq/kg for K-40. All natural soil samples showed low-activity concen-trations. The concentrations of U-238 (6.13-38.84 Bq/kg) and Th-232 (2.58-25.69 Bq/kg) are quite similar, whereas that of K-40 (113.91-9314.11 Bq/kg) are much higher for plant samples. Some of the results obtained are larger than the permissible international radioactivity levels. It is suitable in this regard to compare the activity values of the imported fertilizers and that fabricated in Egypt. The absorbed dose rate was found to be 1.91-1027 nGy/h and the radium equivalent activity concentration was 4.02-1840.98 Bq/kg for fertilizer samples. Soil and plant sample results were 11.86-415.29 nGy/h and 24.20-750.52 Bq/kg for the absorbed dose rate and the radium equivalent activity concentration, respectively. Banana plant contains the largest values. This article presents actual data from investigations of the soil-plant transfer of the primordial radionuclides for some fruits growing on these soils. The transfer factors of 0.35-1.821 for U-238, 0.227-0.480 for Th-232 and 1.95-31.85 for K-40 were obtained. The increase of the transfer of K-40 reflects its great uptake to the fruits. Observed soil-plant factors vary widely, mainly as a result of different soil, vegetation types and environmental conditions. Taking into account the transfer factors of Cs-137 to plants, the measured activity concentrations of this isotope should not endanger the health safety of the produced food.

The levels of natural radioactivity in 43 selected typical building materials used in the construction of walls, windows and doors were determined. For the first time, the radioactivity of iron was measured, revealing the existence of Co-60. A shielded high-purity germanium detector was used to measure the abundance of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40. The materials examined in this work showed radioactivity levels below the limit estimated from radium equivalent activity for acceptable radiation doses attributable to building materials, except for the fact that one gypsum sample showed higher levels of activity than average world levels. The studied building materials were classified according to the radium equivalent activities, which varied from highest to lowest levels as follows: clay, cement, brick, gypsum except from Abu-Zaabal, sand, wood, iron, glass and hydrated lime The existence of the Cs-137 isotope in some building materials was confirmed and its concentration levels were determined (ranging from 0.04 to 21.156 Bq kg(-1)). The alpha-activity of radon was measured in a number of building materials using CR-39 detectors.

Fifty soil samples were collected around the Baoji coal- fired power plant from 25 locations and the natural radionuclide concentrations were determined by a gamma ray spectrometric system. The results show that the activity concentrations in soil samples range from 12.54 to 40.18 Bq kg(- 1), 38.02 to 72.55 Bq kg(- 1) and 498.02 to 1126.98 Bq kg(- 1) for 226Ra, 232Th and 40K with the mean values of 27.35, 52.66 and 764.72 Bq kg- 1, respectively. In order to evaluate the radiological hazard of the natural radioactivity, the radium equivalent activity ( Raeq), the absorbed dose rate ( D) and the annual effective dose rate have been calculated and compared with the internationally approved values. The radium equivalent activity in all the soil samples is lower than the safe limit set in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development report ( 370 Bq kg- 1). The average value of the calculated dose rates is higher than the global average value 55 nGy h(- 1), and the calculated annual effective dose rate is significantly lower than the average annual external effective dose rate ( 460 mu Sv y(- 1)) of the normal background radiation.

The cell batch is controlled by a pre-programmable electronic system that interrupts the current through any cell when the planned electrolyte volume is attained. A starting and a final distillation of water samples are carried out before and after the electrolytic enrichment. Both distillations are made to dryness in order to avoid isotopic fractionation. A second electrolysis step allowed the tritium enrichment factor (EFT) to be doubled. The EFT was calculated by means of the deuterium enrichment factor (EFD) that was measured by mass spectrometry. The EFT was also measured by liquid scintillation counting. The calculated and measured EFT values were found in good agreement, especially for samples with significant tritium content.

To obtain the information of the H-3 and Sr-90 background concentrations in different water bodies around the plant and offer the estimation of the influence after its launching, 170 samples of six water bodies of vapor, ground water, drinking water, surface water, rainwater and seawater were collected, and the background concentrations of H-3 and Sr-90 in the water bodies are reported. The concentrations of H-3 were found to vary in the range 0.5-4.8 Bq l(-1) with an average of 1.1 +/- 0.3 Bq l(-1), and the order is: vapor > rainwater > ground water > drinking water > surface water > seawater. The concentrations of Sr-90 were observed to vary in the range 1.1-19.3 mBq l(-1) with an average of 4.4 +/- 2.6 mBq l(-1). The average concentration order is: ground water > drinking water > surface water > rain water > seawater. Negative correlation is found between the concentrations of H-3 and Sr-90 in different water bodies. The concentrations of the Sr-90 decrease in slow slopes, while the concentrations of H-3 increase. The correlation in groundwater shows a large coefficient with a value of 0.62 due to the relative stable environment. The concentrations of H-3 and Sr-90 are in accordance with the average level in the world. It indicates a low background radioactivity of H-3 and Sr-90 in the vicinity of Tianwan NPP.

Ra-226 Th-232 and K-40 concentrations in igneous rocks from eastern desert, Egypt and its radiological implications	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article						natural radioactivity; granite; external hazard index; annual effective dose	NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; BUILDING-MATERIALS; SOIL; RADIONUCLIDES; GRANITES; PAKISTAN; SAMPLES	By applying high-resolution gamma-ray spectroscopic system, the various radionuclides of the granite samples have been identified quantitatively based on the characteristic spectral peaks. The radionuclides Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 concentrations measured as well as radiological parameters, for 49 granite samples were calculated. This subject is important in environmental radiological protection, since granites are widely used as building and ornamental stones. The variation in concentration of radionuclides for the Um Taghir area can be classified into two regions of low and high natural radioactivity. In old granite, the measured x-ray spectra, activity concentrations were determined for Ra-226 (from 2.9 +/- 1 to 31.8 +/- 6 Bq kg(-1)), Th-232 (range from 1.4 +/- 1 to 14.9 +/- 4 Bq kg(-1)) and K-40 (from 132 +/- 11 to 2080 +/- 46 Bq kg(-1)), in younger granite Ra-226 (from 8.9 +/- 3 to 9087 +/- 95 Bq kg(-1)), Th-232 (range from 9.8 +/- 3 to 3834 +/- 62 Bq kg(-1)) and K-40 (from 471 +/- 22 to 10230 +/- 101 Bq kg(-1)). In Wadi Karim area these values were (14.0 +/- 4-227.0 +/- 15, 10.5 +/- 3-183.0 +/- 14 and 2299 +/- 48-7356 +/- 86 Bq kg(-1)). The highest values of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 concentration (9087 +/- 95, 3834 +/- 62 and 10230 +/- 101 Bq kg(-1), respectively) were observed in anomalies samples at Um Taghir region. Radium-equivalent activities (Ra-eq) in addition to the internal hazard index (H-in) have also been determined. In Um Taghir samples Ra-eq varies between 15 and 625 Bq kg(-1) (old granite), 144-13 982 Bq kg(-1) (younger granite) which exceeds the permitted value (370 Bq kg(-1)) and hazard index (H-in) (0.05-1.74), (0.65-62.34) which is higher than 1, the corresponding values in Wadi Karim samples were 206-685 Bq kg(-1) and from 0.59 to 2.46, respectively. The total absorbed dose rates in air calculated from the concentrations of the three radionuclides ranged from 8 to 6187 nGy h(-1), and the external annual effective dose rate of the areas were determined to be between 0.04 and 30.37 mSv y(-1). This study provides a baseline map of radioactivity background levels in the Egyptian environment and will be used as reference information to assess any changes in the radioactive background level due to geological processes.

Animal studies have shown that the degree of dose uniformity influences the risk of lung cancer. This study investigates the radiation dose distribution of plutonium in human lung. Numerical maps of tissue configuration and target cell locations are obtained from histological sections of human lung tissue stained to enhance the identification of putative cell types for parenchymal lung cancers, i.e. alveolar type 11 cells and Clara cells. Monte Carlo simulations are used to obtain dose distribution around individual particles, and these distributions are used to compute dose distribution in volumes of lung tissue. Lung dose is characterised both by the degree of non-uniformity of irradiation and the relative degree of irradiation of all tissue versus the special cells of interest.

J	Fritsch, P				Fritsch, P.			The distribution of the number of alpha hits per target cell: A new parameter to improve risk assessment for cancer induction using ICRP models	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE				LUNG-TUMORS; PARTICLES; WORKERS; (PUO2)-PU-239	Doses are calculated from the total energy deposited within the different target regions of the organism. After inhalation exposure, only a few particles can be deposited within the respiratory tract that induces a heterogeneous dose distribution. A decrease in risk for lung tumours induction associated to the presence of hot spots has been reported. This was partly explained by a decrease in the transformation rate per gray when cells received more than one alpha hit. This study provides an estimate of the distribution of alpha hits per target cell of the extra thoracic region (ET2), after inhalation exposure to (UO2)-U-238, (PuO2)-Pu-239 or (PuO2)-Pu-238, obtained by a stochastic application of the biokinetic and dosimetric ICRP models. After exposure to one annual limit of intake, homogeneous irradiation of the target cells is observed for (UO2)-U-238, whereas, for PuO2, most of the dose is due to cells receiving daily tens or even hundreds of alpha hits. This underlines the uncertainties in risk assessment associated with a dose rate effect.

Influence of initial lung deposit on pulmonary clearance after plutonium oxide inhalation in rat	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE				MOUSE LUNG; (PUO2)-PU-239; PARTICLES; RISK	Alveolar macrophages are a key element in the clearance of inhaled particles after phagocytosis, and thus participate actively in lung dose distribution and in the risk of tumour formation. We studied the influence of initial lung deposit (ILD) on lung clearance and distribution of activity from 3 d to 3 months after inhalation of two forms Of PuO2 (97% Pu-239 and 70% Pu-239) in rats. ILDs ranging from 2.1 to 17 kBq were used. The total activity measured using X-ray spectrometry 3 months post-inhalation, relative to the ILD, showed a similar decrease in all groups, with the remaining activity representing similar to 30% of the ILD. The total activity recovered in bronchoalveolar lavages represented similar to 60% of the total lung activity. This ratio remained stable over time for the lowest ILD tested but decreased for higher ILD. In addition, the percentage of macrophages associated with particles decreased faster with time in rats with the highest ILD. Under our experimental conditions, there were no marked differences in lung clearance between groups. However, the distribution of the activity seems to vary with the time post-exposure between low and high ILD.

In vitro dissolution of tritium-loaded particles from the JET fusion machine	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE				BIOKINETICS; DOSIMETRY; LUNG	With the experimental evolution of fusion power the levels of tritium used will increase as will the potential for human exposure. Tritium-loaded carbon particles produced during the experimental operation of the Joint European Torus fusion tokamak have been characterised in terms of size, elemental composition and specific activity of tritium elsewhere. The aim of this study was to characterise the dissolution of tritium from these particles in order to derive dose coefficients for this material and provide guidance on monitoring procedures should it be inhaled accidentally. The dissolution of tritium was measured for 100d in lung serum simulant from two batches of materials, SG1 and SG2, which were obtained from carbon tiles originating from different positions in the reactor. Retention over this period followed a three-component exponential. About 1-5% dissolved within a minute, and up to a further 20% dissolved over 100d for the SGI materials but <1% for the SG2 materials. Dissolution between the SGI materials varied greatly, whereas the SG2 materials were similar. As a result of this variability, the assessed dose from urinary excretion could be in error by up to two orders of magnitude depending on the material inhaled. It is recommended that (i) the dissolution is measured for a wider range of materials, preferably dusts collected in working areas, and (ii) in vivo studies tire performed to characterise fully the urine excretion of tritium from these materials. This information could be used to provide improved guidance on dose assessment after special or routine monitoring, taking account of the likely variation of particle size and biological retention half times.

In vitro dissolution study of plutonium in aerosol particles from the Mayak PA: A tool for individualised dose estimates	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE				RESPIRABLE AEROSOLS; WORKERS; URANIUM; FUELS	Chronic inhalation of Pu particles during Mayak processing is a potential concern for workers. Of the many particle properties that affect individualised dose estimates, particle solubility in lung fluids can be most important. This study compares in vitro dissolution rates of several plutonium industrial compounds present at different stages of the Mayak processing cycle using three different solvents. The results are then used to develop values of absorption parameters for individual dose assessments. In this study, the dissolution rates of nitrate, oxide and mixed plutonium aerosols were determined using a serum ultrafiltrate stimulant (SUF), phagolysosomal simulant fluid and Ringer's solution, all using a static system. According to the results obtained with SUF, Pu nitrate is absorbed into the blood to a larger extent than predicted using model parameters currently applied for Mayak workers. Absorption into the blood of 21.5 vs. 3% of deposited nuclide as current model predicts results in underestimation of systemic burden and overestimation of the lung dose. These data are being used to provide improved retrospective dose assessments for inhaled plutonium aerosols.	[Aladova, E. E.; Romanov, S. A.; Khokhryakov, V. F.; Suslova, K.

Risk assessment after internal exposure of members of the public by either inhalation or ingestion of black sand of Camargue was performed. This evaluation required some information on the human bioavailability of U and Th from this sand. In vitro assays to determine the solubility of U, Th and their progeny were performed either in simulated lung fluid, with the inhalable fraction of sand, or in both simulated gastric and intestinal fluids with a sample of the whole sand. The experimental data show that the bioavailability of these radionuclides from Camargue sand is low in the conditions of the study. Prospective dose assessment for both routes of intake show low risk after internal exposure to this sand.

Dose coefficients calculated using the new ICRP model for the human alimentary tract	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE				ABSORPTION; PLUTONIUM	Publication 100 of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) provides a Human Alimentary Tract Model (HATM) to replace the gastrointestinal (GI) model described in Publication 30. The HATM will be used for future calculations of dose coefficients and bioassay predictions, first in a series of publications on occupational intakes of radionuclides, and subsequently in revision of dose coefficients for public exposures. This paper compares dose coefficients calculated using the new model with current values calculated using the GI model for a range of radionuclides. Colon doses are lower using the HATM in all cases considered, in some cases by significant factors. Stomach doses tend to be lower, but are in some cases higher under HATM. The extent to which these changes in doses to gut tissues impacts upon the effective dose varies among nuclides, but there is a tendency for lower effective doses. Special-case applications of the HATM are also described, considering retention on teeth or in the walls of the small intestine. Although the effect of such retention on the regional tissue dose can be large, the effective dose is not greatly changed.	[Phipps, A. W.; Fell, T. P.; Harrison, J.

In the present work, the accumulation of uranium in the brain of rats was studied after repeated exposure by inhalation, chronic exposure by ingestion and acute exposure by injection. For each route of administration, the amount of uranium entering the brain was low. The results showed different accumulation in the brain areas according to the route of intake. Injection gave a rather homogeneous distribution in the different brain areas, whereas both inhalation and ingestion yielded heterogeneous but specific accumulation. These differences in distribution suggest the operation of different mechanisms of delivery of uranium to the brain tissues.

Dose assessment for ingestion of a 330 kilobecquerel Co-60 hot particle	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE					On leaving the irradiated fuel bay at Pickering A nuclear power station, a worker triggered a whole body monitor alarm with activity in or on his head, and despite careful decontamination techniques he subsequently swallowed a hot particle. Over the next 3 d, the radioactivity was tracked through the body. It was then excreted in a single faecal sample and recovered for physical and radiochemical analysis. This analysis demonstrated that the particle contained 330 kBq of Co-60 and only traces of other radioactivity. Its dimensions were similar to 50-130 mu m and its composition was consistent with that of Stellite 6. A dose assessment was carried out taking into account the residence time of the particle in the mouth and its transit through the body. The estimated committed effective dose was 1.4 mSv, and the equivalent dose to the maximally exposed 1 cm(2) of skin, 81 mSv.	[Whillans, D. W.; Chase, W. J.; Wolodarsky, W.

The finalised model is described briefly in this paper, together with the scientific basis and application. The multicompartment model uses first-order linear biokinetics; to describe the retention and clearance of it radionuclide deposited in a wound site using seven default retention categories. Examples using plutonium nitrate in colloidal form and uranium in metal fragments show the behaviour of the less soluble forms of radionuclides in wounds, in which long-term retention is predicted. Using uranium as an example, the wound model is coupled to a uranium International Commission on Radiological Protection systemic model to predict urinary excretion patterns for different physicochemical forms of uranium. The latter application is needed for bioassay interpretation.

Prediction of monitoring data for Pu-239 accidentally injected via wound site based on the proposed NCRP wound model	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE					In response to the consultation from the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) to the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) committee 2, retention and excretion of Pu-239 deposited at wound site were calculated by coupling together the proposed NCRP wound model and the current ICRP systemic model of Pu. The physicochemical forms considered were the soluble form categorized into 'Strong Retention', and the colloidal, particulate and fragmentary forms. The results are summarized as follows. If in soluble form, immediate medical intervention is needed to prevent uptake of radionuclides to body tissues, and prompt wound monitoring is essential for an accurate estimation of the initially deposited radioactivity. If in particulate form, a multi-component exponential equation leads to an overestimation of the absorption rate to blood because of significant lymph node drainage. The committed doses in the organs for direct transfer Of Pu-239 to the blood may be applied to every cases of accidental injection except for fragments.

Modelling of bioassay data from a Pu wound treated by repeated DTPA perfusions: Biokinetics and dosimetric approaches	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE				PLUTONIUM; INHALATION; THERAPY	The aim of this study is to model plutonium (Pu) excretion from the analysis of a well-documented Pu wound case involving repeated diethylene-triamine-penta-acetic acid (DTPA) perfusions up to 390 d and monitoring up to 3109 d. Three modelling approaches were simultaneously applied involving: (1) release of soluble Pu from the wound, estimated with the ICRP66 dissolution model, (2) systemic behaviour of Pu by using ICRP67 model, but also two new models recently reported and (3) additional 'Pu-DTPA' compartments which transfer Pu directly to urinary compartment from blood, interstitial fluids and liver. The best fit of simulations to biological data was obtained by using the new Leggett's systemic model and assuming the presence of three DTPA compartments. Calculations have shown that DTPA treatments have contributed to a 3-fold reduction of the effective dose. Thus, reduction of doses associated with the DTPA treatments can be estimated by modelling which is useful to improve the efficacy of a DTPA treatment schedule based on a diminution of risk.

Percutaneous penetration of uranium in rats after a contamination on intact or wounded skin	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE				PHOSPHORESCENCE ANALYSIS KPA; URANYL-NITRATE; BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES; ABSORPTION	The aim of this work is to assess in vivo in a hairless rat model, the percutaneous diffusion of uranium through intact or wounded rat skin. Six types of wounds were simulated by excoriation and burns with 10 N HF, 2, 5 and 14 N HNO3 and 10 N NaOH on anaesthetised hairless rats. Percutaneous penetration through wounded skin towards blood and subsequent urinary excretion of uranium was followed in vivo during 24 h. The influence of the physicochemical form (solution or powder) of uranyl nitrate (UN) on its percutaneous diffusion was also investigated. UN, even as a powder, can diffuse through intact skin. The presence of uranium in blood is more persistent and its urinary elimination is slower after an RF burn than after an HNO3 burn. Excoriation increases dramatically percutaneous absorption of UN. Thus, percutaneous diffusion of UN is largely dependent on skin barrier integrity with a particular importance of stratum corneum.	[Petitot, F.; Gautier, C.; Moreels, A.

Surface-seeking radionuclides in the skeleton: Current approach and recent developments in biokinetic modelling for humans and beagles	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE				DOSIMETRIC MODEL; PLUTONIUM; PU-239; DOG	In the last decade, the biokinetics of surface-seeking radionuclides in the skeleton has been the object of several studies. Investigations were carried out to determine the kinetics of plutonium and americium in the skeleton of humans and beagles. As a result of these investigations, in recent years the models presented by ICRP in Publication 67 for humans were partially revised, particularly the skeletal part. The aim of the present work is to present recent developments in the biokinetic modelling of surface-seeking radionuclides (plutonium and americium) in beagles and humans.

Comparisons of (239)Pu inhalation doses calculated with ICRP 67 and proposed systemic models	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE				PLUTONIUM	The international Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) has issued an age-specific systemic biokinetic model for plutonium (Pu), which was later modified to give better agreement with measured urinary excretion data. Recently, the current ICRP systemic Pu model was improved by Leggett et al. based on recently developed data. Incorporation of (239)Pu in the human body may result in significant internal radiation exposure. In the present work, the retentions in organs and tissues, the equivalent dose and effective dose from (239)Pu for workers and members of the public were estimated and compared under the current ICRP and the proposed models. (239)Pu contents in liver and in other soft tissue calculated with the proposed model are higher than predicted by the ICRP model, whereas bone content is lower than predicted by the ICRP model. Based on the proposed model, the inhalation equivalent dose coefficient in some organs, e.g. liver and kidneys, is increased, but there is no significant change in the effective inhalation dose coefficients of (239)Pu for workers and members of the public.

Reassessment of tritium dose coefficients for the general public	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE				ORGANICALLY BOUND TRITIUM; DOSIMETRY	Concerns of increased risk from tritium intake by humans have been claimed in the past. The arguments concerning the radiobiological effectiveness of tritium, its longer retention in the human body and the presence of tritium in the DNA hydration shell are analysed in this paper. A biokinetic model for tritiated water and organically bound tritium retention in the human body is used, based on a common approach for mammals using energy and hydrogen metabolism and tested separately with animal experiments. Extension to this model to humans considers the increased role of the brain, food quality and unique growth patterns of humans. Various ages and genders for Caucasians are considered. For an intake of tritium in organic forms in the diet, the retention for the female is of about a factor 2 compared with ICRP recommendations. Effective dose coefficients are estimated to be about a factor of 2 to 3 higher than those of the ICRP.

Monte Carlo simulation of trabecular bone remodelling and absorbed dose coefficients for tritium and C-14	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE				MARROW; EXPOSURE	A Monte Carlo simulation of multiple trabecular bone cavities in adult bone was developed and the absorbed radiation dose factors evaluated for H-3 and C-14. The model was developed to assess the dose from radionuclide uptake in quiescent bone, but also the effects of temporal changes in bone turnover by incorporating bone-modelling units (BMU). Absorbed dose fractions were calculated for target regions that include the endosteal layer where radiation-sensitive stem cells in bone marrow are considered to reside preferentially. There were large differences in the absorbed fractions for two types of bone surface, quiescent and forming. Tritium in quiescent bone results in a dose to the endosteum about 20 times that for the same activity in forming bone surface irradiating osteoblasts. When the quiescent bone surface source was extended from an infinitely thin layer to a more realistic 1 mu m thick, the tritium absorbed fractions for endosteum and red marrow targets fell by more than 2-fold.

Biokinetics and dose estimation of Zn-65 in the salivary gland and male reproductive organs	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE					ICRP is revising its recommendations for radiological protection and has added salivary and secretory glands as new target organs. However, little information is available on the distributions of radionuclides in the salivary gland, secretory glands and male reproductive organs. This study deals with the distribution of Zn-65 in the salivary gland and male reproductive organs as a function of time after a single intravenous and oral administration. For the study, 64 Wistar strain male rats, eight weeks of age were used. The rats were periodically sacrificed, the liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas, thymus, salivary gland, testis, epididymitis and prostate gland sampled and the radioactivity of these organs measured with an NaI scintillation counter. The relative concentration of Zn-65 was highest in the prostate gland. We estimated the radiation dose in humans using rat data for the salivary and secretory glands as well as reproductive organs after intake of Zn-65.

A protocol for the calibration of gamma cameras to estimate internal contamination in emergency situations	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE					The concern about accidents involving radioactive materials has led to the search of alternative methods to quickly identify and quantify radionuclides in workers and in the population. One of the options to face up an eventual demand for mass monitoring of internal contamination is the use of a nuclear medicine diagnostic equipment known as gamma camera, a device used to scan patients who have been administered specific amounts of radioactive materials for medical purposes. Although the gamma camera is used for image diagnosis, it can be calibrated with anthropomorphic phantoms or point sources for the quantification of radionuclide activities in the human body. This work presents a protocol for the calibration of gamma cameras for such application. In order to evaluate the suitability of this type of equipment, a gamma camera available in a public hospital located in Rio de Janeiro was calibrated for the in vivo measurement of (131)I. The calibration includes the determination of detection efficiencies and minimum detectable activities for each radionuclide. The results show that the gamma camera presents enough sensitivity to detect activity levels corresponding to effective doses below 1 mSv. The protocol is the basis to establish a network of Nuclear Medicine Centres, located in public hospitals in eight countries of Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Chile, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay) and in Spain that could be requested to collaborate in remediation actions in the event of an accident involving incorporation of radioactive materials. This protocol is one of the most significant outputs of the IAEA-ARCAL Project (RLA/9/049-LXXVIII) aimed to the Harmonization of Internal Dosimetry Procedures.	[Dantas, B. M.; Lucena, E.

Previous studies have demonstrated the extraction efficiency of these molecules towards uranium and plutonium, the affinity of calix[6]arenes bearing hydroxamic acid groups (LHH3) and carboxylic groups (LCH3) towards americium were studied in this paper by solvent extraction. The results showed that L, I-3 and LCH3 have a very good affinity for americium and enhance the possibility of separating Pu from U and Am. Experiments were performed to perfect the separation of U/Am. The immobilisation of these calixarenes on polymer supports was also investigated for routine applications. Supported calixarenes LCH3 and LHH3 presented the same performances as those obtained in a liquid-liquid system and, hence, are a promising system for the analysis of actinides. These molecules and their uses have been protected (patent pending).

Nuclear Regulatory Authority low energy germanium detection system: Performance for the uranium individual monitoring	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE				GENERAL-POPULATION; TISSUES	The lung counter facility of the Nuclear Regulatory Authority (ARN) is presented. A calibration was carried out using the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) phantom. This phantom is provided with a pair of lungs and lymph nodes containing uranium homogeneously distributed and a set of four overlay plates covering a chest wall thickness (CWT) ranging from 1.638 to 3.871 cm. Individual organ calibration factors were acquired for U-235 photopeaks energies and for each effective chest thickness. Using these factors, a collection of theoretical fitting curves were found. A counting efficiency formulae and a curve for simultaneously active lymph nodes and lung was obtained and checked through measures. Background measurements of the chamber with and without volunteer persons were performed in order to obtain the detection limits (DL) of the system. As this task involves the knowledge of the volunteers CWTs, these magnitudes were determined through formulae selected from the literature taking into account the detection system characteristics. The deviation in the CWT assigned to an individual, generated by applying different equations, produces variations up to 33% in the estimations of the incorporated activity and DL. An analysis of the changes in efficiencies as consequences of the detectors locations and CWT was also performed. This reveals that the DL of the camera (detectors, shield and blank phantom) is between 2.7 and 6.4 Bq of U-235, which implies 4.9 and 11.5 mg lung burden of natural uranium. An estimation of the minimum detectable intake performed with the DL considering blank persons shows that a system with the characteristics described Is only adequate for non-routine individual monitoring.

Application of IDEAS guidelines: The IDEAS/IAEA intercomparison exercise on internal dose assessment	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE					As part of the EU Fifth Framework Programme IDEAS project 'General Guidelines for the Evaluation of Incorporation Monitoring Data', and in collaboration with the International Atomic Energy Agency, a new intercomparison exercise for the assessment of doses from intakes of radionuclides was organised. Several cases were selected, to cover a wide range of practices in the nuclear fuel cycle and medical applications. The cases were: (1) acute intake of HTO, (2) acute inhalation of the fission products Cs-137 and Sr-90, (3) acute inhalation of Co-60, (4) repeated intakes of I-131, (5) intake of enriched uranium and (6) single intake of Pu isotopes and Am-241. This intercomparison exercise especially focused on the effect of the Guidelines proposed by the IDEAS project for harmonisation of internal dosimetry.
