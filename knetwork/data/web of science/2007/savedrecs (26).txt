Daily uranium excretion in German peacekeeping personnel serving on the Balkans compared to ICRP model prediction	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE				DEPLETED URANIUM; DRINKING-WATER; URINE; ABSORPTION; INGESTION; HUMANS	An investigation was performed to assess a possible health risk of depleted uranium (DU) for residents and German peacekeeping personnel serving on the Balkans. In order to evaluate a possible DU intake, the urinary uranium excretions of volunteers were collected and analysed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). In total, more than 1300 urine samples from soldiers, civil servants and unexposed controls of different genders and ages were analysed to determine uranium excretion parameters. All participating volunteers, aged 3-92 y, were grouped according to their gender and age for evaluation. The results of the investigation revealed no significant difference between the unexposed controls and the peacekeeping personnel. In addition, the geometric means of the daily urinary excretion in peacekeeping personnel, ranging from 3 to 23 ng d(-1) for different age groups, fall toward the lower end of renal uranium excretion values published for unexposed populations in literature. The measured data were compared with the International Commission on Radiological Protection prediction for the intake of natural uranium by unexposed members of the public. I he two data sets are in good agreement, indicating that no relevant intake of additional uranium, either natural or DU, has appeared for German peacekeeping personnel serving on the Balkans.

Urine samples are analysed by alpha spectroscopy for U-234, U-235 and U-238. Interpretation of the data is complicated by the presence of natural uranium in the workers' drinking water and diet. Earlier methods used drinking water samples to estimate the dietary component in urine excretion. However, there proved to be insufficient correlation between drinking water concentration and excretion rate. Instead, an iterative calculation is used to identify a typical excretion rate for each individual in the absence of occupational intakes. Bayesian dose-assessment methods, first developed for plutonium bioassay at Los Alamos, have been adapted for uranium. These methods, coupled with an algorithm for identifying each individual's baseline level of uranium from environmental sources, yield improved reliability in the identification of occupational intakes.

Internal dose assessment data management system for a large population of Pu workers	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE				BAYESIAN DETECTION ANALYSIS; RADIATION EXPOSURE; DOSIMETRY	This paper describes the design and implementation of the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) dose assessment (DA) data system. Dose calculations for the most important radionuclides at LANL, namely plutonium, americium, uranium and tritium, are performed through the Microsoft Access DA database. DA includes specially developed forms and macros that perform a variety of tasks, such as retrieving bioassay data, launching the FORTRAN internal dosimetry applications and displaying dose results in the form of text summaries and plots. The DA software involves the following major processes: (1) downloading of bioassay data from a remote data source, (2) editing local and remote databases, (3) setting up and carrying out internal dose calculations using the UF code or the ID code, (3) importing results of the dose calculations into local results databases, (4) producing a secondary database of 'official results' and (5) automatically creating and e-mailing reports. The software also provides summary status and reports of the pending DAs, which are useful for managing the cases in process.	[Bertelli, L.; Miller, G.; Little, T.; Guilmette, R.

Its main purpose is to evaluate the pertinence of the application of different models. This paper describes its first version that is focused on inhalation exposure to actinide aerosols. With this tool, sensitivity analysis on different parameters of the ICRP models can be easily done for aerosol deposition, in terms of activity and particle number, actinide biokinetics and doses. The user can analyse different inhalation cases showing either that dose per unit intake cannot be applied if the aerosol contains a low number of particles or that an inhibition of the late pulmonary clearance by particle transport can occur which contributes to a 3-4 fold increase in effective dose as compared with application of default parameters. This underlines the need to estimate systematically the number of deposited particles, as well as to do chest monitoring as long as possible.	[Poncy, J.

J	Hodgson, A; Stradling, N; Phipps, A; Fell, T				Hodgson, Alan; Stradling, Neil; Phipps, Alan; Fell, Tim			A simple method for assessing that internal doses are below action levels	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE					The accidental or deliberate dispersal of radioactive aerosols into the public environment may require urgent assessments of radiation dose to be made to aid decisions on whether treatment should be implemented, or to reassure the public that doses are acceptably low. However, rapid assessments will be difficult due to lack of information on factors such as the particle size distribution and biokinetic characteristics of the aerosol. A procedure is described that relates the amount of activity of a radionuclide in the body and excreta to time after intake for a specified dose, taking into account the likely variations in aerosol size and differences in the biokinetic behaviour of the same or different chemical forms of the radionuclide. The implementation of the procedure for an intake of caesium-137 and a dose level of 1 mSv is described and the information presented graphically. Figures for other specified dose levels can be produced by simply scaling the data by an appropriate factor. The figures can also be used to assess the most appropriate monitoring procedure and indicate the uncertainty in the assessed dose according to the parameter and parameter values used. This approach is proposed for rapid decisions on public reassurance when potentially large numbers of people are involved. It is not intended as a substitute for individual dose assessment.

Ratio of aerosol and gases of radioactive chlorine and particle size distribution of aerosol formed by high-energy proton irradiation	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE				RADON DECAY PRODUCTS; ACCELERATOR TUNNELS; AIR; COEFFICIENTS	To estimate internal doses due to the inhalation of radionuclides produced by the nuclear spallation of the air nuclei in high-energy proton accelerator facilities, the physicochemical properties of radionuclides are very important. Thus, the ratio of aerosol and gases of Cl-38 and Cl-39 formed by irradiating argon gas-added air with a 48 MeV proton beam has been measured. Radionuclides of Cl-38 and Cl-39 exist as aerosol, acid gas and non-acid gas. The percentages of activity of Cl-38 and Cl-39 aerosols are about 80%. The number size distributions of non-radioactive aerosol were characterised by two peaks with diameters of 10-20 nm and larger than 20 nm. As a result predicted by a simple surface model, it was found that the activity size distribution of Cl-38 aerosols can be regarded as that having a single peak at 120 nm.

Assessment of dose from faecal measurement data	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE					At AWE, an annual faecal sample forms part of the internal monitoring strategy for insoluble forms of plutonium. The setting of a derived investigation level (DIL) and assessment of doses from results for faecal samples can pose some difficulties in view of uncertainties related to: (a) the time and number of intakes during the monitoring period and (b) the result from a single sample. This paper uses Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the activity that would be expected in faeces following varying numbers of intake events during the monitoring period. The variation in faecal activity of a long-term excretor is also investigated. The implications of the results for the setting of the DIL and assessment of dose are discussed.

Dose effect for South Serbians due to U-238 in natural drinking water	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE				IONIZATION MASS-SPECTROMETRY; SOIL SAMPLES; URANIUM; ISOTOPES; RATIO	The use of depleted uranium ammunition in South Serbia during the 1999 Kosovo conflict raised a great deal of public concern in the Balkans. Radioactivity levels of U-238 in 20 wells and lake water samples were checked from the viewpoint of internal radiation exposure for South Serbian subjects. We have measured U-238 concentration using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, whereas thermal ionisation mass spectrometry has been used for the measurement of isotope ratios, e.g. U-234/U-238 and U-235/U-238. The concentration of uranium in water samples varies in the range 1.37-63.18 mBq/L. U-234 belongs to the U-238 natural radioactive decay series, and at secular equilibrium, the abundance ratio, U-234/U-238, corresponds to the ratio of their half-lives. The U-234/U-238 activity ratio varies in the range 0.88-2.2 and U-235/U-238 isotope ratio varies from 0.00698 to 0.00745. These findings indicate that uranium in water was a mixture of natural and anthropogenic origin. The annual effective dose due to U-238 was estimated to be in the range 9.2 X 10(-5)-2.1 X 10(-3) mSv.

Practical action levels for chelation therapy in plutonium inhalation using nose swab	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE					The aim of this study is to propose action levels for chelation therapy in the case of inhalation of plutonium compounds using nose swabs. The relationship between the activity found in the nose swabs and early faecal excretion was investigated using actual cases at JAEA-NFCEL. The ratio was found to be in log-normal distribution. The action levels based on the activity of nose swab corresponding to 10 ALI (= 200 mSv) are determined for the facilities at JAEA-NFCEL by using the relationship and specific information such as isotopic ratio and physicochemical characteristics of plutonium compounds.

Distribution of uranium in dounreay workers due to uptake from the environment	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE					At Dounreay, there are a number of facilities in which the main radiological hazard is the intake of uranium. The hazard is managed through the implementation of controls and contamination surveys in order to reduce the risk of intake. In order to provide reassurance that radiological significant intakes are not taking place, a routine urine sample programme is in place. As well as being exposed to work place sources of uranium workers are also exposed to the intake of uranium from foodstuffs and water, which are not associated with their work at Dounreay. In order to characterise the intake of the radionuclides from the environment, urine samples were collected from a group of Dounreay personnel who are not exposed to uranium in their workplace. The distribution of the uranium isotopes U-234, U-235 and U-238 has been assessed for these workers. The distributions will be used to assess the likelihood of uranium detected in urine for a uranium worker being due to an intake in the workplace. The best match to distributions of U-234 and U-238 was found to be a combination of normal and lognormal distributions.

Uncertainty on faecal analysis on dose assessment	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE					Monitoring programmes for internal dose assessment may need to have a combination of bioassay techniques, e.g. urine and faecal analysis, especially in workplaces where compounds of different solubilities are handled and also in cases of accidental intakes. Faecal analysis may be an important data for assessment of committed effective dose due to exposure to insoluble compounds, since the activity excreted by urine may not be detectable, unless a very sensitive measurement system is available. This paper discusses the variability of the daily faecal excretion based on data from just one daily collection; collection during three consecutive days: samples analysed individually and samples analysed as a pool. The results suggest that just 1 d collection is not appropriate for dose assessment, since the 24 h uranium excretion may vary by a factor of 40. On the basis of this analysis, the recommendation should be faecal collection during three consecutive days, and samples analysed as a pool, it is more economic and faster.	[Juliao, Ligia M. Q.

This paper is a survey of the injections Ca-DTPA administered as a chelating molecule and it will be a part of the authorisation process for Ca-DTPA by intravenous administration. Out of 1158 injections administered to 469 persons, 548 events of possible or confirmed contamination were reported. These employees were followed by occupational physicians according to the current French regulations. These incidents took place at work, were most often minor, not requiring follow-up treatment. The authors present (1) a synthesis of the most recent findings. Due to its short biological half-time and its limited action in the blood, Ca-DTPA does not chelate with plutonium and americium as soon as these elements are deposited in the target organs. It justifies an early treatment, even in cases of suspected contamination followed by additional injections if necessary (2) data concerning these 1158 injections (route of contamination, dosage, adverse effects, etc.) The authors also investigated a study on the efficacy of the product on a group of persons having received five or more injections. These results were compared with the efficacy estimated theoretically. Dosages and therapeutic schemes were proposed based on these observations. This synthesis is the result of a collective work having mobilised the occupational medicine departments, the medical laboratories inside a working group CEA-COGEMA-SPRA.

Ustur whole body case 0269: Demonstrating effectiveness of IVCa-DTPA for Pu	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE				PLUTONIUM; RADIONUCLIDES	This whole body donation case (USTUR Registrant) involved a single acute inhalation of an acidic Pu(NO(3))4 solution in the form of an aerosol 'mist'. Chelation treatment with intravenously (i.v.) Ca-EDTA wits initiated on the day of the intake, and continued intermittently over 6 months. After 2.5 y with no further treatment, a course of i.v. Ca-DTPA was administered. A total of 400 measurements of (239+240)Pu excreted in urine were recorded; starting on the first day (both before and during the initial Ca-EDTA chelation) and continuing for 37 y. This sampling included all intervals of chelation. In addition, 91 measurements of (239+240)Pu-in-feces were recorded over this whole period. The Registrant died about 38 y after the intake, at age 79 y, with extensive carcinomatosis secondary to adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland. At autopsy, all major soft tissue organs were harvested for radiochemical analyses of their (238)Pu, (239+24)Pu and (241)Am content. Also, all types of bone (comprising about half the skeleton) were harvested for radiochemical analyses, as well as samples of skin, subcutaneous fat and muscle. This comprehensive data set has been applied to derive 'chelation-enhanced' transfer rates in the ICRP Publication 67 plutonium biokinetic model, representing the behaviour of blood-borne and tissue-incorporated plutonium during intervals of therapy. The resulting model of the separate effects of i.v. Ca-EDTA and Ca-DTPA chelation shows that the therapy administered in this case succeeded in reducing substantially the long-term burden of plutonium in all body organs, except for the lungs. The calculated reductions in organ content at the time of death are similar to 40%, for the liver, 60% for other soft tissues (muscle, skin, glands, etc.), 50% for the kidneys and 50% for the skeleton. Essentially, all of the substantial reduction in skeletal burden occurred in trabecular bone. This modelling exercise demonstrated that 3-y-delayed Ca-DTPA therapy was as effective as promptly administered Ca-EDTA.	[James, A. C.; Sasser, L. B.; Stuit, D.

Application of a prospective model for calculating worker exposure due to the air pathway for operations in a laboratory	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE					In order to arrive at recommendations for guidelines on maximum allowable quantities of radioactive material in laboratories, a proposed mathematical model was used for the calculation of transfer fractions for the air pathway. A set of incident scenarios was defined, including spilling, leakage and failure of the fume hood. For these 'common incidents', dose constraints of 1 mSv and 0.1 mSv are proposed in case the operations are being performed in a controlled area and supervised area, respectively. In addition, a dose constraint of 1 mu Sv is proposed for each operation under regular working conditions. Combining these dose constraints and the transfer fractions calculated with the proposed model, maximum allowable quantities were calculated for different laboratory operations and situations. Provided that the calculated transfer fractions can be experimentally validated and the dose constraints are acceptable, it can be concluded from the results that the dose constraint for incidents is the most restrictive one. For non-volatile materials this approach leads to quantities much larger than commonly accepted. In those cases, the results of the calculations in this study suggest that limitation of the quantity of radioactive material, which can be handled safely, should be based on other considerations than the inhalation risks. Examples of such considerations might be the level of external exposure, uncontrolled spread of radioactive material by surface contamination, emissions in the environment and severe accidents like fire.

RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE				INHALED PLUTONIUM; DRINKING-WATER; REMOVAL; RAT; ZNDTPA; AM-241	Accidental or deliberate dispersion of plutonium (Pu) and americium (Am) into the public environment could contaminate large numbers of people by inhalation. If measures to reduce the internal dose are considered appropriate, oral administration of either calcium (Ca) or zinc (Zn) diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid (DTPA) would be the simplest treatment. Published experimental data from rats on the effects of oral DTPA on the retention of inhaled Pu and Am show that: (1) orally administered Zn-DTPA is as effective as repeated intravenous injection for the decorporation of Pu and Am inhaled as nitrates, although higher dosages are required; (2) oral Zn-DTPA appears to be an effective treatment for Am dioxide but not Pu dioxide; (3) maximum decorporation of Pu, by oral or intravenous administration, requires a large molar excess of Zn-DTPA over Pu (> 1 X 10(6)); (4) neither oral nor injected Zn-DTPA are likely to be effective for Pu oxides, nor when Pu and Am nitrates are mixed with other dusts. It is concluded that oral administration of a simple aqueous solution of Zn-DTPA could be an important treatment in accident or emergency scenarios after intake of pure chemical forms of Pu and Am, which are highly or moderately soluble in biological fluids. However, more research is needed on the efficacy of treatment when these forms are mixed with other materials. Importantly, studies designed to increase the efficiency of uptake of DTPA from the gastrointestinal tract could appreciably reduce the dosage.

Decorporation of plutonium by pulmonary administration of Ca-DTPA dry powder: A study in rat after lung contamination with different plutonium forms	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE				INHALATION; LIPOSOMES; ELIMINATION; DEPOSITION; AMERICIUM; RODENTS; NITRATE; AM-241	This study evaluates the decorporation efficacy of a pulmonary administration of a new Ca-DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) dry powder (18 mu mol kg(-1) of body mass) after pulmonary contamination of rats with different Pu compounds. After inhalation Of PuO2, a delayed intratracheal administration of DTPA cannot reduce significantly the retention of Pu in the lungs but limits its transfer in liver and skeleton. After pulmonary contamination by Pu nitrate, early insufflation of the DTPA powder appears twice as more efficient than an i.v injection of DTPA (30; mu mol kg(-1)) to reduce Pu retention in the lungs and is as effective as i.v. injection to limit the extrapulmonary deposit. In contrast, a delayed administration of DTPA cannot reduce the lung or extrapulmonary retention. In conclusion, the improvement of aerodynamic properties of DTPA powder leads to an increase of DTPA amount deposited in the lungs and enhances the body decorporation.	[Serandour, A.

Inositol hexaphosphate: A potential chelating agent for uranium	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE				EFFICACY; REMOVAL; EHBP; RATS	Chelation therapy is an optimal method to reduce the radionuclide-related risks. In the case of uranium incorporation, the treatment of choice is so far i.v infusion of a 1.4% sodium bicarbonate solution, but the efficacy has been proved to be not very high. In this study, we examine the efficacy of some substances: bicarbonate, citrate, diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA), ethidronate (EHBP) and inositol hexaphosphate (phytic acid) to chelate uranium using a test developed by Braun et al. Different concentrations of phytic acid, an abundant component of plant seeds that is widely distributed in animal cells and tissues in substantial levels, were tested and compared to the same concentrations of sodium citrate, bicarbonate, EHBP and DTPA. The results showed a strong affinity of inositol hexaphosphate for uranium, suggesting that it could be an effective chelating agent for uranium in vivo.

An approach to reduction of uncertainties in internal doses reconstructed for the Techa river population	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE				DOSIMETRY SYSTEM; COHORT	A methodology was developed for reduction of uncertainties in estimates of internal dose for residents of the Techa Riverside communities, who were exposed as a result of releases of radionuclides from the Mayak plutonium production facility in 1949-56. The 'Techa River Dosimetry System' (TRDS) was specifically elaborated for reconstruction of doses. A preliminary analysis of uncertainty for doses estimated using the current version of the TRDS showed large ranges in the uncertainty of internal absorbed dose and led to suggestions of methods to reduce uncertainties. The new methodological approaches described in this paper will allow for significant reduction of uncertainties of Sr-90-dose. The major sources of reduction are: making use of individual measured values of Sr-90 and through development of a Household Registry to associate unmeasured persons with measured persons living in the same household(s).

Comparison of dose estimation from occupational exposure to (239)Pu using different modelling approaches	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE				MAYAK WORKERS; PLUTONIUM	Several approaches are available for bioassay interpretation when assigning Pu doses to Mayak workers. First, a conventional approach is to apply ICRP models per se. An alternative method involves individualised fitting of bioassay data using Bayesian statistical methods. A third approach is to develop an independent dosimetry system for Mayak workers by adapting ICRP models using a dataset of available bioassay measurements for this population. Thus, a dataset of 42 former Mayak workers, who died of non-radiation effects, with both urine bioassay and post-mortem tissue data was used to test these three approaches. All three approaches proved to be adequate for bioassay and tissue interpretation, and thus for Pu dose reconstruction purposes. However, large discrepancies are observed in the resulting quantitative dose estimates. These discrepancies can, in large part, be explained by differences in the interpretation of Pu behaviour in the lungs in the context of ICRP lung model. Thus, a careful validation of Pu lung dosimetry model is needed in Mayak worker dosimetry systems.	[Romanov, S. A.; Khokhryakov, V. F.; Aladova, E. E.; Khokhryakov, V. V.; Suslova, K.

Plutonium in the Ozyorsk population	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE				EXTRAPULMONARY ORGAN DISTRIBUTION; MAYAK-PRODUCTION-ASSOCIATION; FALLOUT PLUTONIUM; HUMAN-TISSUES; JAPANESE; WORKERS	Results of the long-term autopsy studies on plutonium body burden in the population of Ozyorsk situated in the vicinity of the radiochemical plant of the Mayak Production Association (Russia) have been presented. The data were obtained from radiochemical analysis of the soft tissue and bone samples collected at the autopsy of 239 non-occupational individuals for the period 1975-2003. The dynamics of plutonium accumulation in the Ozyorsk population is associated with the environmental contamination due to radioactive releases from the Mayak Production Association. Plutonium body burden and its distribution between the respiratory tract and extrapulmonary organs depend on the residence time of individuals in the city. Since the early 1950s, plutonium body burden in the Ozyorsk population was linearly increasing at the almost constant rate of accumulation and amounted to 5.8 Bq at 35 y after the beginning of residence in the city that was several tens of times higher than background levels of fallout plutonium. Distribution of plutonium in the body was also studied in Ozyorsk population. Plutonium deposition fraction in the respiratory tract did not exceed 11% of the body burden in individuals with short residence times (1-9 y) and is halved for increasing residence times more than 10 y. The average skeleton:liver ratio was 65:20 = 3.25.	[Suslova, K. G.; Khokhryakov, V. F.; Sokolova, A.

This paper describes some of the difficulties experienced in dose assessment modelling of the very complex DU aerosols created in the Capstone studies, e.g. high concentrations, heterogeneous aerosol properties, non-lognormal particle size distributions, triphasic in vitro dissolution and rapid time-varying functions of both DU air concentration and particle size. The approaches used to solve these problems along with example results are presented.

Contamination in workers was measured in vivo and bioassay was performed. Solubility of aerosol in lungs was studied by in vitro dissolution test with a simulant solution of the extracellular airway lining fluids. Model calculation for the estimation of intakes was done with the experimentally obtained parameters of aerosol, with modified times of intake, with scattering factors, including Types A and B errors, and with corrections on skull size for in vivo measurements. For most cases, an acceptable fit to the experimental data was obtained; for two cases with intakes taking place long time ago (similar to 30 y), some changes in the model are necessary.

Use of air monitoring and experimental aerosol data for intake assessment for Mayak plutonium workers	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE				PRODUCTION-ASSOCIATION; PARTICLE-SIZE	One of the major uncertainties in reconstructing doses to Mayak Plutonium (Pu) workers is the unknown exposure patterns experienced by individuals. These uncertainties include the amounts of Pu inhaled, the temporal exposure pattern of Pu air concentration, the particle-size distribution and solubility of the inhaled aerosols. To date, little individual and workplace-specific information has been used to assess these parameters for the Mayak workforce. However, extensive workplace-specific alpha activity air monitoring data set has been collated, which, if coupled with individual occupational histories, can potentially provide customised intake scenarios for individual Mayak workers. The most available Pu air concentration data are annual averages, which exist for over 100 defined work stations at radiochemical and chemical-metallurgical manufacturing facilities and basically for the whole period of Mayak production operations. Much sparser but more accurate data on Pu concentrations in workers' breathing zone are available for some major workplaces and occupations. The latter demonstrate that within a working shift, Pu concentrations varied over a range of several orders of magnitude depending on the nature of the operations performed. An approach to use the collated data set for individual intake reconstruction is formulated and its practical application is demonstrated. Initial results of ongoing experimental study on historic particle size at Mayak PA and their implications for intake estimation are presented.

Uncertainties in individual doses in a case-control study of thyroid cancer after the Chernobyl accident	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE				I-131; RISK	Individual radiation doses to the thyroid were reconstructed for 2239 subjects of a case-control study of thyroid cancer among young people that was carried out in regions of Belarus and Russia contaminated by radioactive fallout from the Chernobyl accident. Although the process of dose reconstruction provides a point estimate of each subject's dose, it is obvious that there is uncertainty associated with these dose calculations. The following main sources of uncertainty in the estimated individual doses were identified: (1) shared and unshared errors associated with parameters of the dosimetry model; and (2) unshared errors that are associated with the variability, reliability and ability of information from the personal interviews. Besides setting up proper distributions for the parameters of the dosimetry model, inter-individual correlations were also defined to take into account shared errors. By the application of Monte Carlo simulations, a set of approximately log-normally distributed thyroid doses was obtained for each subject; the geometric standard deviations of the distributions are found to vary among individuals from 1.7 to 3.7.

Limits of DPUI application associated with the number of particles within actinide aerosols	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Internal Dosimetry	OCT 02-05, 2006	Montpellier, FRANCE				FUEL FABRICATION; UNCERTAINTIES; (PUO2)-PU-239; WORKERS	Dose per unit intake (DPUI) of radionuclides is obtained using International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) models. After inhalation exposure, the first model calculates the fraction of activity deposited within the different regions of the respiratory tract, assuming that the aerosol contains an infinite number of particles. Using default parameters for workers, an exposure to one annual limit of intake (ALI) corresponds to an aerosol of (PuO2)-Pu-239 containing similar to 1 x 10(6) particles. To reach such an exposure, very low particle number might be involved especially for compounds having a high specific activity. This study provides examples of exposures to actinide aerosols for which the number of particles is too low for a standard application of the ICRP model. These examples, which involve physical studies of aerosols collected at the workplace and interpretation of bioassay data, show that the number of particles of the aerosol can be the main limit for the application of DPUI after inhalation exposure.

The well-specified neutron source with its emission rate and the anisotropy was installed at the centre of the neutron irradiation room, which is 6.6 x 7.6 X 6.3 m(3) in size. The neutron spectra of each source was measured using the Bonner sphere spectrometer (KRISS-BSS).

The calibration of the WBC is made using bottle phantoms with a homogeneous activity distribution. The same calibration procedures have been simulated using Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) code and FLUKA and the results of the full energy peak efficiencies for eight energies and five phantoms have been compared with the experimental results. The deviation between experiment and simulation results is within 10%. Furthermore, uncertainty budget evaluations have been performed to find out which parameters make substantial contributions to these differences. Therefore, statistical errors of the Monte Carlo simulation, uncertainties in the cross section tables and differences due to geometrical considerations have been taken into account. Comparisons between these results and the one with inhomogeneous distribution, for which the activity is concentrated only in certain parts of the body (such as head, lung, arms and legs), have been performed. The maximum deviation of 43% from the homogeneous case has been found when the activity is concentrated on the arms.

At the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI), a calculation code-UCWBC code-for whole-body counter calibrations using voxel phantoms has been developed as an EGS4 Monte Carlo user code. To validate the UCWBC code for calibrating whole-body counters at JAERI, response functions and counting efficiencies of a p-type high-purity Ge (UPGe) semiconductor detector used for the whole-body counter were evaluated for a water-filled block-shape phantom by use of UCWBC code and were measured by experiments. The voxel version of the water-filled block-shape phantom based on an actual phantom was used for the calculations. Furthermore, counting efficiencies of the Ge semiconductor detector for the male and female voxel phantoms developed at JAERI were evaluated in the photon energy range from 60 to 1836 keV by the UCWBC code in order to examine the differences between the counting efficiencies for voxel phantoms. In conclusion, it was found that the response functions and counting efficiencies of the Ge semiconductor detector found by the UCWBC code for the water-filled block-shape phantom are in good agreement with measured data. The UCWBC code was validated by those comparisons. It was also found that the counting efficiencies of the Ge semiconductor detector depend on the size of the phantoms and the effective distance between phantom and detector. The calibration of whole-body counters using voxel phantoms and Monte Carlo methods would be quite useful for the improvement in the accuracy of measurement results.

For the measurement of the individual beta radiation dose, personal dosemeters for the fingers/tips are required. LiF:Mg,Cu,P is a promising thermoluminescent (TL) material which allows the production of thin detectors with sufficient sensitivity. Dosimetric properties of two different types of extremity dosemeters, designed to measure the personal dose equivalent H-p(0.07), have been compared: LiF:Mg,Ti (TLD100) and LiF:Mg,Cu,P (TLD700H). A type test for energy response for photon and beta radiation according to ISO 4037-3 and ISO-6980 was carried out and the results for both dosemeters were compared. Simultaneous measurements with both types of dosemeters were performed at workplaces, where radiopharmacenticals containing different radioisotopes are prepared and applied. Practices in these fields are characterized by handling of high activities at very small distances between source and skin. The results from the comparison of the two-dosemeter types are presented and analysed with respect to different radiation fields. Experiments showed a satisfactory sensitivity for the thinner dosemeter (TLD 700H) for detecting beta radiation at protection levels and a good energy response.

Detailed dosimetric characterisations of the wagons have been made and the external exposure at different stages of the work that is done by the employees have been measured in terms of H*(10). For the study presented in this paper, and corresponding to a used fuel shipment composed of UO2 and UO2-PuO2, it has been observed that the photon and neutron doses are very similar. In addition, the order of magnitude of the total dose integrated by an employee who would carry out 100 times the series of essential operational tasks, has been found to be similar to 250 mu Sv. This value is compared with those observed for other previously investigated shipments involving the exposure to photon fields only.

Operational comparison of TLD albedo dosemeters and solid state nuclear tracks detectors in fuel fabrication facilities	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	European Workshop on Individual Monitoring of Ionising Radiation (IM2005)	APR 11-15, 2005	Vienna, AUSTRIA	Austrian Res Ctr, European Radiat Dosimetry Grp, THERMO Fischer, GmbH Austria & Toshiba Europe Div Personal Comp				The authors carried out an operational study that compared the use of TLD albedo dosemeters and solid state nuclear tracks detector in plutonium environments of Japan Nuclear Cycle Development Institute, Tokai Works. A selected group of workers engaged in the fabrication process of MOX (Plutonium-Uranium mixed oxide) fuel wore both TLD albedo dosemeters and solid state nuclear tracks detectors. The TL readings were generally proportional to the counted etch-pits, and thus the dose equivalent results obtained from TLD albedo dosemeter agreed with those from solid state nuclear tracks detector within a factor of 1.5. This result indicates that, in the workplaces of the MOX fuel plants, the neutron spectrum remained almost constant in terms of time and space, and the appropriate range of field-specific correction with spectrum variations was small in albedo dosimetry.

From the results of this work it is recommended that, whenever feasible, 24 h urine sampling should be conducted to avoid large uncertainties in the quantitation of daily urinary excretion values. For storage, urine samples should be acidified and kept frozen before analysis. Measurement of total uranium in urine by ICP-MS at physiological levels (<10 ng.l(-1)) requires no sample preparation besides UV photolysis and/or dilution. For the measurement of thorium in urine by ICP-MS, it can be concluded, that salt removal from the urine samples is not recommended. For the measurement of actinides in urine it is shown that ICP-MS is well-suited and a good alternative to alpha-spectrometry for isotopes with T-1/2 > 5 x 10(4) years. In general, ICP-MS measurements are an easy, fast and cost-saving methodology. New improved measuring techniques (HR-SF-ICP-MS) with detection limits in urine of 150 pg.l(-1) (1.9 mu Bq.l(-1)) for U-238, 30 pg.l(-1) (2.4 mu Bq.l(-1)) for U-235 and 100 pg.l(-1) (0.4 mu Bq.l(-1)) for Th-232, respectively, meet all necessary requirements. This method should therefore become the routine technique for incorporation monitoring of workers and of members of the general public, in particular for uranium contamination.

In direct in vivo monitoring technique the optimum choice of the detectors to be applied for different monitoring tasks has been investigated in terms of material, size and background in order to improve conditions namely to increase counting efficiency and reduce background. Detailed studies have been performed to investigate the manifold advantageous applications and capabilities of numerical simulation method for the calibration and optimisation of in vivo counting systems. This calibration method can be advantageously applied especially in the measurement of low-energy photon emitting radionuclides, where individual variability is a significant source of uncertainty. In bioassay measurements the use of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) can improve considerably both the measurement speed and the lower limit of detection currently achievable with alpha spectrometry for long-lived radionuclides. The work carried out in this project provided detailed guidelines for optimum performance of the technique of ICP-MS applied mainly for the determination of uranium and thorium nuclides in the urine including sampling procedure, operational parameters of the instruments and interpretation of the measured data. The paper demonstrates the main advantages of investigated techniques in comparison with the performances of methods commonly applied in routine monitoring practice.

OBT measurements for urine are not performed routinely, mainly because of the lengthy work needed in preparation of the samples, when using the standard oxygen combustion method. A simpler and more rapid method based on liquid scintillation counting (LSC) was employed, and an evaluation was performed to check its suitability for urine samples. The principle of the proposed method is based on subtracting the LSC counts of the water phase sample (HTO) from the total activity of the urine sample (ORT + HTO). A good correlation was found between the results obtained when applying the proposed direct method and the Gold standard method. The minimum detectable activity when using this method was determined.

Modern lung counter systems use several HPGe detectors, and the ratio of the different count rates of the detectors can be used to locate a 'hot spot' and apply correction algorithms for activity calculation. In the present work it is shown that the variability of the isotopic composition of the uranium source has a major effect on the process of localization of the 'hot spot' in the lungs. A way to eliminate this effect is proposed by separate normalization of the count rates of each energy peak.

Improvements in routine internal monitoring - An overview of the idea project	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	European Workshop on Individual Monitoring of Ionising Radiation (IM2005)	APR 11-15, 2005	Vienna, AUSTRIA	Austrian Res Ctr, European Radiat Dosimetry Grp, THERMO Fischer, GmbH Austria & Toshiba Europe Div Personal Comp			QUANTIFY PREVIOUS EXPOSURES; RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS; CALIBRATION; URANIUM; DETECT; URINE	The IDEA project aimed to improve the assessment of incorporated radionuclides through developments of advanced in vivo and bioassay monitoring techniques and making use of such enhancements for improvements in routine monitoring. Many of these findings are not new in the sense that they are being already employed in advanced laboratories or for specialised applications. The primary goal was to categorise those new developments regarding their potential and eligibility for the routine monitoring community. Attention has been given to in vivo monitoring techniques with respect to detector characteristics and measurement geometry to improve measurement efficiency with special attention to low energy gamma emitters. Calibration-specifically supported by or through methods of numerical simulation-have been carefully analysed to reduce overall measurement uncertainties and explore ways to accommodate the individual variability based on characteristic features of a given person. For bioassay measurements at low detection limits, inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy offers significant advantages both in accuracy, speed, and sample preparation. Specifically, the determination of U and Th in urine and the associated models have been investigated. Finally, the scientific achievements have been analysed regarding their potential to offer benefits for routine monitoring. These findings will be presented in greater detail in other papers at this conference, whereas this paper intends to give an overview and put both the scientific achievements as well as the derived benefits into perspective.

Application of voxel phantoms in whole-body counting for the validation of calibration phantoms and the assessment of uncertainties	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	European Workshop on Individual Monitoring of Ionising Radiation (IM2005)	APR 11-15, 2005	Vienna, AUSTRIA	Austrian Res Ctr, European Radiat Dosimetry Grp, THERMO Fischer, GmbH Austria & Toshiba Europe Div Personal Comp			DOSE ASSESSMENT; MODELS	This article is dedicated to the application of voxel phantoms in whole-body counting calibration. The first study was performed to validate this approach using IGOR, a physical phantom dedicated to fission and activation product (FAP) measurement, and a graphical user interface, developed at the IRSN internal dose assessment laboratory, called OEDIPE (French acronym for the tool for personalised internal dose assessment) associated with the Monte Carlo code MCNP. The method was validated by comparing the results of real measurements and simulations using voxel phantoms obtained from CT scan images of IGOR. To take this application further, two studies were carried out and are presented in this article. First, a comparison was made between the IGOR voxel based phantom (IGOVOX) and a voxel human body (Zubal Phantom) to confirm whether IGOR could be considered as a realistic representation of a human. Second, the errors made when considering sources homogeneously distributed in the body were assessed against real contamination by taking into account the biokinetic behaviour of the radioactive material for two modes of exposure: the ingestion of Cs-137 in soluble form and the inhalation of insoluble Co-60 several days after acute incorporation.

Localization of activities in the human body with a whole-body counter	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	European Workshop on Individual Monitoring of Ionising Radiation (IM2005)	APR 11-15, 2005	Vienna, AUSTRIA	Austrian Res Ctr, European Radiat Dosimetry Grp, THERMO Fischer, GmbH Austria & Toshiba Europe Div Personal Comp				The whole-body counter of the Radiation Protection Unit at the ARC Seibersdorf research GmbH has two HP Ge-detectors for measuring radionuclides, which are internally deposited in the human body. The detector system has a scanning geometry, where one detector is placed below the bed and the other detector above the bed. The body counter is placed in a massive shielded chamber. This device is especially used for measuring radioactive exposed workers with the possibility of intake by inhalation and ingestion. In the most cases whole-body counters are calibrated with anthropomorphic phantoms where activity is homogenously distributed. However, in some cases radioactivity can be located as a 'Hot Spot' in an organ. The localisation of 'Hot spots' at least in one dimension was the topic of this work. Experiments were done by means of a water-filled bottle phantom where three point sources (Cs-137, Ba-133 and Co-60) were placed at different positions. Measurements show that these radionuclides can be located within 1.5 cm along the longitudinal axis of the phantom with activities for Cs-137 of at least 240 Bq, Ba-133 of at least 670 Bq and Co-60 of at least 140 Bq.

The interpretation of uranium contents in workers bioassay samples requires knowledge on uranium excretion and its dependence on intake by diet. Exceptionally high concentrations of natural uranium in private drinking water sources have been measured in the granite areas of Southern Finland. Consequently, high concentrations of natural uranium have been observed in the urine and hair samples of people using water from their own drilled wells. Natural uranium content in urine and hair samples of family members, who use uranium-rich household water, have been analyzed by using ICP-MS. The uranium concentrations both in urine and hair samples of the study subjects were significantly higher than the world-wide average values. In addition, gammaspectrometric methods have been tested for determining uranium in hair samples. This method can be used only for samples with highly elevated uranium concentrations.

The method was checked for natural uranium, which produces peaks due to photon energies of 63.3, 92.6 and 185.7 keV. By combining nine measurements, an overall improvement of the MDA by a factor of about 3 was achieved. Uranium contamination levels lower than the MDA of a single spectrum could be detected with acceptable accuracy when analyzing the sum spectra. Specific results are given for four workers occupationally exposed to natural uranium.

The results are tabulated in a database. The calculated contents of Th-228,Th-230,Th-232 in organs or tissues using their reference concentrations in foodstuffs for the European population are compared with autopsy data. The model prediction of Th-232 in whole body for a 50-year-old unexposed person is 22 mBq, 86% of that in skeleton, 9.7% in other soft tissues, 3.4% in liver, 0.7% in kidneys and 0.01% in blood. The modelling predicts lower contents of the natural Th isotopes in whole body, especially in blood compared with measured data for the unexposed public. Modelled Th-232 daily urinary excretions are 5 to 10 times less than bio-assay data from the authors' own laboratory.	[Li, W.

Some of these ores have uranium and thorium natural decay series associated. This study was carried out in a niobium mine, where is obtained concentrates of niobates-tantalates, cassiterite and zirconite. The aim of this study is the evaluation of the occupational exposure to uranium, thorium, niobium and tin through urine bioassay data. In order to have it, 105 urine samples were analysed: 17 samples of exposed workers collected after a working day, 49 samples of exposed workers collected before a working day and 39 samples of local non-exposed people, assigned as a control group. The samples were analysed by mass spectrometry. The obtained results showed that the average concentration of Nb, Sn and U in the exposed group is statistically higher than those found in the control group indicating an occupational exposure. For Th there were no statistically difference between the exposed and the control group.	[Juliao, Ligia M. Q.
