Estimation of growth rate of hokutolite from Tamagawa hot-spring, Akita, Japan	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd Asia-Pacific Symposium Radichemistry	OCT 17-21, 2005	Beijing, JAPAN				CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION	The concentrations of radium isotopes and the progenies (Ra-226; Ra-228 and Th-228) in three hokutolite samples from Tamagawa hot-spring were measured. These isotopes were analyzed by a well-type HPGe gamma-ray spectrometer for the 351, 911 and 583 keV gamma-ray from (214) stopPb, (228) Ac and Tl-208, respectively, each being in radioactive equilibrium with precursors. Concentration of Ra-226 and Ra-228 were observed to be in the range of 52-85 and 7.1-85 Bq/g, respectively. The activity ratios of (228) Ra/(226)pt Ra and Th-228/(226) Ra provided the estimation of the growth rate (0.09-0.15 mm/y). Estimated Ra-228/Ra-226 activity ratios in hot-spring water from surface of three hokutolite were concordant.

Experimental evaluation of the water ingression mechanism for corium cooling	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							HOT ROCK; PENETRATION	Experiments were performed to assess the significance of water ingression cooling in the quenching of molten corium. Water ingression is a mechanism by which water penetrates into cracks and pores of solidified corium to enhance cooling that would otherwise be severely limited by the low thermal conductivity of the material. Quench tests were conducted with 2100 degrees C melts weighing similar to 75 kg composed of UO2, ZrO2 and chemical constituents of concrete. The amount of concrete in the melts was varied between 4% and 23%. The melts were quenched with an overlying water layer; three tests were conducted at a system pressure of 1 bar and four tests at 4 bar. The measured cooling rates were found to decrease with increasing concrete content and, contrary to expectations, are essentially independent of system pressure. For the lower concrete content melts, cooling rates exceeded the conduction-limited rate with the difference being attributed to the water ingression mechanism. Measurements of the permeability of the corium "ingots" produced by the quench tests were used to obtain a second, independent set of dryout heat flux data, which exhibits the same trend as the quench test data. The data was used to validate an existing dryout heat flux model based on corium permeability associated with thermally induced cracking. The model uses the thermal and mechanical properties of the corium and coolant, and it reproduces the very particular data trend found for the dryout heat flux as a function of concrete content. The model predicts that water ingression cooling would be most effective for concrete-free corium mixtures such as in-vessel type melts. For such a melt the model predicts a dryout heat flux of similar to 400 kW/m(2) at a pressure of 1 bar. The results of this study provide an experimental basis for a water ingression model that can be incorporated into computer codes used to assess accident management strategies. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The innovative features of this counter with respect to existing ones rely on two aspects: (i) an optimised design based on Monte Carlo calculations in order to select the most appropriate materials, geometry and detector disposition for maximum efficiency and (ii) novel electronics based on digital signal processing (DSP) reducing the system dead time. The paper recalls the design process, the electronics, the construction and assembly of the counter. Then the results of the first experimental tests will be reported. We will show the characterization of the main physical parameters of the counter, the calibration and the verification of a wide variety of plutonium bearing samples available in the PERLA laboratory at JRC Ispra. This will include pure homogeneous samples (Pu dioxide powders, metal Pu, MOX powders and pellets) and some tests on heterogeneous samples representative of scrap material. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

A general description of the simulation code used is presented and the expected behavior of the particles in the first of the two Penning traps is discussed. Special attention is paid to the influence of this behavior on the operation of the experimental setup. The effect of electric excitations on the ion motions is described in detail. Also the transfer of the ions between the two traps and consequences for their motion in the second Penning trap are addressed. Scaled Coulomb force simulations are used to estimate the size of the ion cloud inside the Penning traps for larger numbers of particles. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A strong increase of the secondary electron yield is observed with increasing charge state of the projectile both at normal and oblique incidences. No variation of the electron yield with the projectile kinetic energy is observed at normal incidence. Therefore, the electron emission process in highly charged ion-uranium dioxide (UO2) interactions is dominated by potential electron emission. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The choice of materials is a crucial point, which will determine issues such as the plasma facing components lifetime before refurbishment or the tritium inventory build up in the vessel, which should be limited for safety reasons. In order to tackle these issues, the European Task Force on Plasma-Wall Interaction has been implemented in the frame of EFDA (European Fusion Agreement) in the fall 2002 with the aim "to provide ITER with information concerning lifetime-expectations of the divertor target plates and tritium inventory build-up rates in the foreseen starting configuration and to suggest improvements, including material changes, which could be implemented at an appropriate stage." The EU-PWI-TF brings together the efforts of 24 European associations in the following fields of investigation: Material erosion and transport in tokamaks. Tritium inventory and removal. Transient heat loads on plasma facing components. Dust production and removal. Associated modelling and diagnostic development. This paper will present the organisation of the EU-PWI-TF. It will provide examples for the multitude of surface processes in Plasma-Wall Interaction and present the status of knowledge concerning material erosion and hydrogen retention for the choice of ITER materials (Beryllium, Carbon and Tungsten).

Due to high particle loads, especially hydrogen isotopes from the plasma, wall material is eroded and redeposited at different positions. This leads to the formation of surface layers, which are themselves subject to erosion. It is known that carbon exhibits chemically enhanced erosion by low energy hydrogen ions or elevated temperatures. However, room temperature erosion of carbon by keV ions is considered to be governed by a purely kinematic sputtering process. We found that this is not necessarily the case for carbon surface layers with thicknesses of a few nanometers. To investigate the basic mechanisms governing the erosion of carbon, carbon layers in the range of several nm thickness are evaporated on clean metal substrates. The films are irradiated with 1 or 1.3 keV deuterium ions and the surface layer thickness and composition are analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). For our studies we choose carbon films on tantalum, titanium and beryllium to compare the influence of a wide range of substrate atomic masses. Our experimental data is compared to Monte Carlo calculations using the SDTRIM code which takes into account kinematic interactions and adjusts the sample composition dynamically. We discuss the results with respect to the kinematic collision interaction and the ion-induced chemical phase formations. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Sticking coefficient and SIMS of hydrocarbons on fusion relevant plasma-sprayed tungsten surfaces	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th International Workshop on Inelastic Ion-Surface-Collisions	SEP 17-22, 2006	Hernstein, AUSTRIA			sticking coefficient; hydrocarbons; tungsten; plasma-sprayed tungsten	ASDEX-UPGRADE; DIVERTOR	In this work we concentrate on the quantification of the sticking coefficient of CD(3)(+) on fusion relevant plasma-sprayed tungsten (PSW) surfaces in the collision energy range from about 0 up to 100 eV. PSW samples were cut from ASDEX Upgrade tiles and both untreated and electropolished surfaces are investigated. A collision energy, E(coll), selected CD(3)(+) ion beam deposits hydrocarbon layers onto the target surfaces which are ex-situ analyzed by nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) via D((3) He, p)(4)He at 800 kV and 2.5 MeV, respectively. The sticking coefficient, S, for deuterium has been found to be collision energy dependent, decreasing with increasing energy. It is in the order of S similar to 0.4 for PSW and S similar to 0.1 for electro polished PSW at E(coll) = 10 eV. Secondary ion mass spectra of charged particles are recorded after ion-surface collisions with the polished PSW surface for collision energies up to 100 eV. While at very low collision energies below about 10 eV only simple reflection of CD(3)(+) is observed, at higher collision energies both fragmentation of the projectile and fragmentation of ion-surface reaction products are observed. Concerning the stability of the layers we prove that hydrogen exchange plays a role on the time scale of weeks. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Temperature dependence of the D-H replacement rates in D-implanted oxide ceramics exposed to H2O vapor	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th International Workshop on Inelastic Ion-Surface-Collisions	SEP 17-22, 2006	Hernstein, AUSTRIA			hydrogen isotope exchange; oxide ceramics; ion beam analysis; water splitting; hydrogen production	ROOM-TEMPERATURE; HYDROGEN; EXCHANGE; DEUTERIUM; PROTIUM; AIR	Temperature dependence of the D-H replacement rates in D-implanted BaCe0.9Y0.1O3-delta exposed to H2O vapor has been studied by means or he ERD technique with MeV He+ ion beam. It is found that the decay constant of D, namely D-H replacement rate increases monotonically as the specimen temperature is elevated from the implantation (room) temperature up to 50 degrees C. The concentration of H absorbed in the specimen by the D-H replacement is also found to be almost comparable to the implantation concentration of D, while the concentration of D implanted and H absorbed by the D-H replacement are reduced when the specimen is annealed in the vacuum. The apparent activation energy for the decay constant of D at elevated temperatures is found to be 0.70 eV, which is considerably higher than the one which is expected to be obtained at cooling temperatures below the implantation temperature. No reduction in the concentration of H absorbed by the D-H replacement is ascribed to enough fast absorption of H due to splitting of H2O at the surface, in comparison with thermal release of D and H. The higher activation energy for the decay constant of D is also ascribed to the contribution of thermal detrapping to emission of D, and HD due to the local molecular recombination of D and H detrapped thermally with D and H in traps.

As these applications become more sophisticated attention has focused on the accuracy of the Be-10 standards used to calibrate the AMS measurements. In recent years it has become apparent that there is a discrepancy between two of the most widely used Be-10 AMS standards, the ICN Be-10 standard and the NIST Be-10 standard. The ICN (ICN Chemical & Radioisotope Division) Be-10 AMS standard was calibrated by radioactive decay counting. Dilutions, ranging from 5 x 10(-13) to 3 x 10(-11) Be-10/Be, have been prepared and are extensively used in many AMS laboratories. The NIST Be-10 standard, prepared at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is calibrated by mass spectrometric isotope ratio measurements. To provide an independent calibration of the Be-10 standards we implanted a known number of Be-10 atoms in both Si detectors and Be foil targets. The Be-10 concentrations in these targets were measured by AMS. The results were compared with both the ICN and NIST AMS standards. Our Be-10 measurements indicate that the Be-10/Be-9 isotopic ratio of the ICN AMS standard, which is based on a Be-10 half-life of 1.5 x 10(6) yr, is 1.106 +/- 0.012 times lower than the nominal value. Since the decay rate of the ICN standard is well determined, the decrease in Be-10/Be-9 ratio requires that the Be-10 half-life be reduced to (1.36 +/- 0.07) x 10(6) yr. The quoted uncertainty includes a 5% uncertainty in the activity measurement carried out by ICN. In a similar fashion, we determined that the value of the NIST Be-10 standard (SRM4325) is (2.79 +/- 0.03) x 10(-11) Be-10/Be-9, within error of the certified value of (2.68 +/- 0.14) x 10(-11). The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) internal standards were also included in this study. We conclude that the Be-9(n,gamma) neutron cross section is 7.8 +/- 0.23 mb, without taking into account the uncertainty in the neutron irradiation. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Accurate automated non-resonant NRA depth profiling: Application to the low He-3 concentration detection in UO2 and SiC	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						automation; NRA; depth profiling; depth resolution; helium; SIMNRA		An automated method was developed to extract elemental depth profiles from non-resonant nuclear reaction analyses (NRA), which involves a two-stage procedure. The first stage enables the determination of the number of layers to be used in the final depth profile determination along with the thicknesses of each of the layers. To this end, the RESNRA program, which relies on the SIMNRA 5.0 simulation software to calculate a multilayer target, was designed at CERL A definition of the depth resolution based on statistical considerations is proposed. In the second stage of the fitting process, a depth profile and corresponding error bars are extracted from the experimental spectrum by running a generalized reduced gradient (GRG2) algorithm using the previously calculated multilayer target. The one-to-one correspondence between the experimental spectrum and the depth profile demonstrates the objectivity of the method. The method is then applied to determining low concentration He-3 depth profiles in implanted UO2 and SiC samples using the He-3(H-2, He-4)H-1 non-resonant nuclear reaction. The results clearly demonstrate the relevance and potential of the method. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Monte Carlo simulations supported by experiments indicate that the profile exhibits more complex shape. In the presented paper we proposed the new, simple mathematical formula which allows describing the profile with a good accuracy. Only two phenomenological parameters and the energy spectrum of the implanted positrons are needed for the description of the profile. Their values were found for dozen of materials for the positron emitted from the Na-22 and Ge-68\Ga-68 sources. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	[Anonymous]				[Anonymous]			Containment radiation monitoring spiking	NUCLEAR PLANT JOURNAL			English	Article								After restart of Palo Verde Unit Two following a Steam Generator Replacement Project, the containment atmosphere particulate radiation monitor began to routinely spike to higher than normal levels (and then back down). During the periods when the airborne radiation count rates were increasing from less than 2000 counts per minute (cpm) up to 15,000 cpm in a few hours, legitimate concerns were raised by the Control Room, Management and the NRC about the potential for reactor coolant pressure boundary (RCPB) leakage, such as occurred with the reactor head leakage at another facility. Effluents personnel in every case were instructed to sample the containment atmosphere. Finding that the increase was always due to natural radioactivity did reassure personnel after the fact, but during the significant increases plant staff were justifiably apprehensive - even though no radioactivity associated with the reactor coolant system (RCS) was ever detected. In addition, the NRC correctly asked whether increased radon levels could mask low level RCS leakage.									0	0	0	0	0	EQES INC	GLEN ELLYN	799 ROOSEVELT RD, BUILDING 6, STE 208, GLEN ELLYN, IL 60137-5925 USA	0892-2055			NUCL PLANT J	Nucl.

Fuel cycle options for the production and utilization of denatured plutonium	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							WATER-REACTOR; MINOR-ACTINIDES; NUCLEAR-FUEL; TRANSMUTATION; NP-237; THORIUM; PU-238	Denatured reactor plutonium with a Pu-238 isotopic content of similar to 6% or somewhat more can be produced in a suitably adapted fuel cycle. Several such fuel cycle options are proposed. Reenriched reprocessed U-235/U-236/U-238, which can be blended with some low-enriched U-235/U-238 fuel, leads, after burnup cycle of 50 to 60 GWd/tonne in a pressurized water reactor (PWR) core, to denatured reactor plutonium with more than 8% Pu-238 isotopic content. Presently existing reactor plutonium with similar to 2.8% Pu-238 from spent fuel with a burnup of 50 GWd/tonne can also be converted in PWRs, during one or two burnup cycles over 50 to 60 GWd/tonne into denatured reactor plutonium. This is also demonstrated by burnup calculation for different fuel cycle scenarios using, e.g., reenriched reprocessed uranium, thorium, and minor actinides. Denatured reactor plutonium with 6% or somewhat more Pu-238 isotopic content can be considered as proliferation-resistant fuel and could be treated like low-enriched (< 20% U-235) uranium fuel. It can be incinerated by multiple recycling in PWRs or fast reactors. Advanced aqueous reprocessing or pyroprocessing as well as related refabrication methods, as they are being developed for transmutation scenarios of the minor actinides, would be best suited for such adapted fuel cycle options. Safeguards needs and aspects for the different proposed fuel cycle options are discussed.

Numerical modeling of evaporating thin liquid film instability on a heated cylindrical rod with parallel and cross vapor flow	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							CONTOUR RECONSTRUCTION METHOD; MULTIPHASE FLOW; SHARP-INTERFACE; FRONT-TRACKING; FREE-SURFACE; SIMULATION; COMPUTATIONS; FLUID; GRIDS	The behavior of an evaporating thin liquid film on,a nonuniformly heated cylindrical rod with both parallel and cross vaporflow has been numerically investigated. The aim is to develop a mechanistic model for local dry out in. boiling water reactors (BWRs). The liquid film on a full-length BWR fuel rod may experience significant axial and azimuthal heat flux gradients and cross flow due to variations in the thermal-hydraulic conditions in surrounding subchannels caused by proximity to an inserted control blade tip and/or the top of part-length fuel rods. Such heatflux gradients coupled with localized crossflow may cause the liquid film on the fuel rod surface to,rupture by hydrodynamic instability, thereby forming a dry hot spot. These localized dryout phenomena cannot be accurately predicted by traditional subchannel analysis methods in conjunction with empirical dryout correlations. To this end, a numerical model based on the level contour reconstruction method has been developed The model includes a ghost-cell extrapolation technique,to handle the complex interface geometry. Additionally, a sharp interface temperature technique has been implemented Application of the model to BWR fuel rods shows that localized cross flow coupled with heatflux gradients can lead to liquid film rupture and dry spot formation.

Process development for bulk separation of trivalent actinides and lanthanides from radioactive high-level liquid waste	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							EXTRACTION; SOLVENT; RECOVERY	In-house R&D studies have resulted in the development of processes for the bulk separation of trivalent actinides and lanthanides from radioactive high-level liquid waste. Synthesis of solvents, namely, n-octyl (phenyl)-NN-di-isobutyl carbamoyl methyl phosphine oxide and diglycolamide-based tetra (2-ethylhexyl) diglycolamide (TEHDGA), at the required purity has been carried out, and a suitable process for their respective use in actual application has been developed. Inactive scale engineering runs comprised of simultaneous extraction and stripping operations were carried out to establish the process on an engineering scale, including reuse of the solvent system. The composition of surrogate high-level waste (HLW) used at engineering-scale studies corresponds to first-cycle raffinate from reprocessing of long-cooled pressurized heavy water reactor fuel with a burnup of 6500 MWd/tonne. Since trivalent lanthanides and actinides exhibits similar extraction behavior at higher acidity, cerium and lanthanum were only used in making surrogate HLW to represent all the trivalent lanthanides and actinides. Indigenously developed mixer-settlers using a passive system of mixing were used for these runs. Over a period of similar to 10 h, similar to 300 l of surrogate HLW solutions were contacted with solvent. The results of such repeated trials have shown near-total removal of cerium and lanthanum (>99.8% and 97%, respectively) at aqueous-to-organic ratio of 2.5:1 for a TEHDGA system. As the distribution coefficient values for trivalent actinide (Am-241) are found to be significantly higher than those for trivalent lanthanides for both of the solvent systems under consideration, it can be inferred that separation of trivalent actinides along with lanthanides could be feasible using these solvent systems.

Knowledge of radioactivity present in marble materials enables one to assess any possible radiological risks to human health. The concentrations of Ra-226, Th-212 and K-40 in Chinese commercial marble range from 8.4 to 157.4, 5.6 to 165.5 and 44.1 to 1352.7 Bq kg(-1), respectively. The natural radionuclide concentration varied with color and production site of commercial marble. The activity concentrations of Ra-226, Th-212 and K-40 in white, gray, black, green and yellow marble samples are comparatively smaller than those in brown and red marble samples. The radium equivalent activity (Ra-eq), the external hazard index (He-x), the internal hazard index (H-in) and the annual gonadal dose equivalent were also calculated and compared with the internationally recommended values. One type of brown commercial marble (TSB) of China does not satisfy the universal standards.

Neutron measurements around storage casks containing spent fuel and vitrified high-level radioactive waste at ZWILAG	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							FIELDS; SPECTROMETRY	Spectrometric and dosimetric measurements were made around a cask containing spent fuel and a cask containing high-level radioactive waste at the Swiss intermediate waste and spent fuel storage facility. A Bonner sphere spectrometer, an LB 6411 neutron monitor and an Automess Szintomat 6134A were used to characterise the n-gamma fields at several locations around the two casks. The results of these measurements show that the neutron fluence spectra around the cask containing radioactive waste are harder and higher in intensity than those measured in the vicinity of the spent fuel cask. The ambient dose equivalents measured with the LB 6411 neutron monitor are in good agreement with those obtained using the Bonner spheres, except for locations with soft neutron spectra where the monitor overestimates the neutron ambient dose equivalent by almost 50%.

Natural ionizing radiation exposure of the Spanish population	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							INDOOR RADON LEVELS; SPAIN; COMMUNITY	This study investigates the exposure of the Spanish population to natural radiation sources. The annual average effective dose is estimated to be 1.6 mSv, taking into account contributions from cosmic radiation (18%), terrestrial gamma radiation (30%), radon and thoron inhalation (34%) and ingestion (18%). Cosmic radiation doses were calculated from town altitude data. Terrestrial gamma ray exposure outdoors were derived from the MARNA (natural gamma radiation map of Spain); indoor exposure was obtained multiplying the corresponding outdoor value by an experimentally calculated conversion factor. Radon doses were estimated from national surveys carried out throughout the country. To assess doses by ingestion, data from a detailed study on consumption habits in Spain and average radioactivity values from UNSCEAR have been considered. The variability in the exposures among individuals in the population has been explicitly taken into account in the assessment.	[Garcia-Talavera, M.; Matarranz, J.

In this regard, soil, sand and brick samples were collected from different places of the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) and Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), Pakistan. The samples were processed and placed in plastic containers. NRPB radon dosemeters were installed in it at heights of 25 cm above the surface of the samples and containers were then hermetically sealed. After 40-80 d of exposure to radon, CR-39 detectors were removed from the dosemeter holders and etched in 25% NaOH at 80 degrees C for 16 h. From the measured radon concentration values, Rn-222 exhalation rates were determined. Exhalation rate form soil, sand and brick samples was found to vary from 114 +/- 11 to 416 +/- 9 mBq m(-2) h(-1), 205 +/- 16 to 291 +/- 13 mBq m(-2) h(-1) and 245 +/- 12 to 365 +/- 11 mBq m(-2) h(-1), respectively.

The outdoor gamma absorbed dose was measured as 50.1 nGy h(-1), corresponding to a total gamma radiation level (of terrestrial and cosmic origin) of 61.5 mu Sv y(-1). The activity concentrations in the surface soil samples collected from the study area were determined as 25.2, 23.7 and 289.2 Bq kg(-1) for the natural radionuclides (238)U, (232)Th and (40)K, respectively, and 8.02 Bq kg(-1) for the fission product (137)Cs. These natural radioactivity sources result in a terrestrial gamma level of 46.9 mu Sv y(-1). The drinking water samples collected from the region carry an average of 0.0493 Bq l(-1) of gross alpha and 0.1284 Bq l(-1) of gross beta activities, which together cause an annual effective dose of 1.83 mu Sv. The measurement results obtained in this study indicate that the region has a background radiation level that is within the natural limits and shows no significant departure from the other parts of the country.

The response of the crystal was found to be largely linear over the upper 90% of its dynamic range-the deviations at lower energies can be attributed to the shortcomings of the photomultiplier tube (PMT) and is in fact a generic problem when using high-gain PMTs with lanthanum halide scintillators. At 662 keV, a measured energy resolution of 4.1% FWHM was recorded at room temperature. In comparison to earlier generations of LaCl3 detectors, the internal background spectrum shows significantly less X-ray, beta, gamma-ray and alpha contamination. The integral background count rate in the energy region 20 keV-3 MeV was determined to be 1.8 cm(-3) s(-1) of which most (1.5 cm(-3) s(-1)) can be attributed to the beta continuum from La-138 and only similar to 0.04 cm(-3) s(-1) to the alpha complex from Ac-227 and daughters. Using these data, we have determined the light output of alpha particles relative to the equivalent energy electrons (or alternately gamma-rays) to be, alpha/gamma = 0.35 +/- 0.02.

These scintillators are currently being assessed by ESA for use as remote sensing gamma-ray spectrometers on future planetary missions. In addition to their superior scintillation properties (high light output, fast time response and good stopping power), they offer significant benefits when designing gamma-ray detection systems for resource-limited spacecraft-not only in terms of resources but also in terms of reliability and robustness. We present the results of an investigation into the gamma-ray detection properties of a 2 '' x 2 '' LaBr3:Ce crystal, characterized using radioactive sources over the energy range 14-3220 keV. The response of the crystal was found to be largely linear over the upper 95% of the dynamic range, the deviations at lower energies can be attributed to the shortcomings of the PMT. Compared to smaller volume crystals, no substantial degradation in light output, or alternately, energy resolution has been observed. For example, at 662keV, an energy resolution of 3% FWHM was measured. Experiments with monoenergetic protons show that they create approximately half the light output of gamma-rays.

The experiment was carried out at the HASYLAB synchrotron radiation facility using highly monochromatic pencil beams across the energy range 10.5-100 keV. Additional full-area measurements were carried out using radioactive sources. All measurements were carried out at room temperature. The measured FWHM energy resolutions (Delta E/E) under pencil beam illumination were 29% (LaBr3) and 32.4% (LaCl3) at 10.5 keV falling to 7.8% (LaBr3) and 9.2% (LaCl3) at 100 keV. At 662 keV, the energy resolutions were 3.9% and 3.0% FWHM. The proportionality of the energy responses shows marked deviations from linearity above and below the La edge at 39.8 keV. At the edge the energy response changes by 3%. Fine structure across the edge was also investigated using single photon count rate measurements taken in 1 eV steps across the edge. The data show considerable near-edge structure when compared to curves generated from standard atomic data tables. However, very little evidence was found for extended X-ray fine structure suggesting that the bulk of the structure arises from the local coordination environment. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, the principle and mathematical method of determining the void fraction of horizontal gas-liquid flow by using a single-energy gamma-ray system is described. The gamma-ray source is the radioactive isotope of Am-241 with gamma-ray energy of 59.5 keV. The time-averaged value of the void fraction in a 50.0-mm i.d. transparent horizontal pipeline is measured under various combinations of the liquid flow and gas flow. It is found that increasing the gas flow rate at a fixed liquid flow rate would increase the void fraction. Test data are compared with the predictions of the correlations and a good agreement is found. The result shows that the designed gamma-ray system can be used for measuring the void fraction in a horizontal gas-liquid two-phase flow with high accuracy.

The radioisotope activities in the area under investigation lay in the range of (21 +/- 4) to (38 +/- 13) Bq circle L-1 for Ra-226, (9 +/- 2) to (15 +/- 5) Bq circle L-1 for Th-232, and (154 +/- 28) to (303 +/- 54) Bq circle L-1;l for K-40. The mean values were 27, 12, and 201 Bq circle L-1 respectively. Among oils, variations in radionuclide activities could be on account of differences in TDS, HCO3, and Ba, with high or low pH. In this environment, oil properties differently affected the mobilization of natural radionuclides. The range of Ra-226 variation had been compared with available data from other countries. The calculated absorbed dose rate ranged from 22.33 to 32.66 nGy circle h(-1) in location (13) and (E) respectively, which was less than the accepted value.	[Abbady, A.; El-Arabi, A.

Thermal and radiation-induced segregation in model Ni-base alloys	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Radiation Effects, Deformation and Phase Transformations in Metals and Ceramics held at the 2006 TMS Annual Meeting	MAR 12-16, 2006	San Antonio, TX	Minerals Met & Mat Soc			FE; DIFFUSION; SYSTEM	Since Generation IV nuclear energy systems will operate at higher temperatures than current light water reactors, Ni-base alloys are receiving attention as candidate core materials. One aspect of the radiation response of Ni-base alloys to radiation that is not well understood is grain boundary segregation. In this work, three alloys, specifically Ni-18Cr, Ni-18Cr-9Fe, and Ni-18Cr-0.08P were given a series of thermal treatments and quenching to understand the development of thermal non-equilibrium segregation (TNES). Additionally, they were irradiated using 3.2 MeV protons at temperatures from 200 to 500 degrees C to doses up to 1 dpa. Grain boundary segregation was measured with Auger Electron Spectroscopy and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy. Chromium enrichment due to TNES could be caused by interactions between Ni and Cr or by interactions with impurity elements such as B, C, or N. Under irradiation, the addition of iron to Ni-18Cr reduced the grain boundary chromium depletion, while the addition of phosphorous increased the grain boundary chromium depletion.

More precisely, length (as measured by dilatometry) and lattice parameter (as measured by X-ray diffraction) increase with time and seems to reach saturation after a few months for the microscopic scale. This bulk swelling can be correlated to self-induced radiation due to the decay of the different plutonium isotopes (Pu-238, Pu-239, Pu-241 and Pu-242) which also induce helium that tends to forms clusters, then bubbles. Many experimental and theoretical results have already been published on this topic. The goal of this paper is to review some of the results and to propose a strategy for both experiments and modelling to try to answer some of the remaining questions regarding swelling and more generally self-irradiation defects in plutonium alloys.

Optimization of BWR fuel lattice enrichment and gadolinia distribution using genetic algorithms and knowledge	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							SYSTEM	An optimization methodology based on the Genetic Algorithms (GA) method was developed for the design of radial enrichment and gadolinia distributions for boiling water reactor (BWR) fuel lattices. The optimization algorithm was linked to the HELIOS code to evaluate the neutronic parameters included in the objective function. The goal is to search for a fuel lattice with the lowest average enrichment, which satisfy a reactivity target, a local power peaking factor (PPF), lower than a limit value, and an average gadolinia concentration target. The methodology was applied to the design of a 10 x 10 fuel lattice, which can be used in fuel assemblies currently used in the two BWRs operating at Mexico. The optimization process showed an excellent performance because it found forty lattice designs in which the worst one has a better neutronic performance than the reference lattice design. The main contribution of this study is the development of an efficient procedure for BWR fuel lattice design, using GA with an objective function (OF) which saves computing time because it does not require lattice burnup calculations. circle dot 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, the sorption of Th(IV) on TiO2 in the presence or absence of soil fulvic acid (FA)/humic acid (HA) as a function of pH, ionic strength and FA/HA concentration has been studied by a batch method. The morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results indicate that sorption of Th(IV) on TiO2 increases from 0% to similar to 94% at pH 1 similar to 4, and then maintains level with increasing pH values. Both FA and HA have a positive effect on Th(IV) sorption at low pH values and the contribution of FA on Th(IV) sorption is rather higher than that of HA at pH < 4. The sorption is weakly dependent on the concentration of KNO3 in solution, but the cations K+, Na+ and Li+ influence Th(IV) sorption more obviously. The batch results indicate that the inner sphere complex formation is formed at bare surfaces or FA/HA-bound TiO2 particle surfaces. Results of SEM analysis show that the particle sizes of TiO2, Th TiO2 and Th-HA-TiO2 colloids are quite different. Surface complexation may be considered as the main sorption mechanism.

The method involves dialysis of PVP-Fe and PVP-Co complexes against triple-distilled water. Fe-59 and Co-60 were used as radioactive tracers of iron and cobalt throughout the experiment. No other chemicals are required for clean separation of cobalt from iron. The optimum condition for separation has been obtained at pH 5 using 10% aqueous solution of PVP. The method is applicable from trace scale to macro-scale. Very high separation factors have been obtained. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Search and analysis of the alpha-induced PSL signals presented the time-dependent growth of PSL intensity from the Pu particles and the range of PSL intensities from radon decay products, making it possible to discriminate Pu particles from radon decay products using an empirical Pu-discrimination level, and then to quantify the Pu activities on a particle-by-particle basis. The method is useful for a fast screening of filter samples for Pu particles because it requires no special skills and tedious procedures during its use, gives a low discriminable activity for individual Pu particles with a relatively short exposure time, and allows us to measure a large number of filter samples at the same time.

The photoreactor for water disinfection is a tubular reactor inside which UV emitting lamps are placed. The key to its good performance is a combination of optimum irradiation dose and fluid residence time distributions (RTD). The inlet system is one of the better possibilities of controling the fluid RTD. Three configurations have been tested. In the first step, colored tracer experiments help us to raise the mean trends of the flow behavior for the different configurations. When the inlet is located at the central bottom of the reactor, the flow is closed to a perfect mixing whereas lateral inlets lead to a plug flow with axial dispersion behavior. RTD measurements using radiotracer was carried out in a wide range of flowrates. The axial dispersion coefficient increases linearly with the Reynolds number. It is lower when the lateral inlet is divided in three inlets uniformly distributed around the bottom of the reactor. This paper shows the usefulness of radioactive isotopes as tracers in the field of wastewater treatment. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kam, E; Bozkurt, A				Kam, Erol; Bozkurt, Ahmet			Environmental radioactivity measurements in Kastamonu region of northern Turkey	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						gamma dose; radioactivity; soil; water; radon; Kastamonu; Turkey	DOSE-RATES; ISTANBUL; WATERS	Located in the north-western part of Turkey, the province of Kastamonu has lately been receiving national attention because of its cultural and touristic attractions. This study assesses the environmental radioactivity levels of the region through measurements of indoor radon concentrations and indoor/outdoor gamma absorbed dose in air and radionuclide activities in surface soil and drinking water. The indoor (222)Rn activity concentration was found to be 98.4Bq/m(3) equivalent to an annual effective dose of 2.48 mSv. The indoor and outdoor gamma absorbed doses were measured as 54.81 and 48.03 nGy/h, respectively, corresponding to a total gamma radiation level (of terrestrial and cosmic origin) of 0.33 mSv/y. The activity concentrations in the soil samples collected from the study area were determined as 32.93, 27.17, 431.43 Bq/kg for the natural radionuclides (238)U, (232)Th and (40)K, respectively, and 8.02 Bq/kg for the fission product (137)Cs. These natural radioactivity sources result in a terrestrial gamma level of 60 mu Sv/y. The water samples collected from the region carry an average of 0.0089 Bq/1 of gross alpha and 0.271 Bq/1 of gross beta activities which together cause an annual effective dose of 1.83 mu Sv. The measurement results obtained in this study indicate that the region has a background radiation level that is within the natural limits and shows no significant departure from the other parts of the country.

The concentration of Cs-137 and 40K varied from 2.8 to 37.5 Bq/kg and from 266 to 675 Bq/kg dry weight (dw), respectively (central values). The average concentrations of U-238 and Th-232 daughter products varied from 8 to 27 Bq/kg and from 13 to 40 Bq/kg dw, respectively. The measured U-235 activity ranged from 0.7 to 2.5 Bq/kg dw. Samples of different sedimentary properties, studied for the radioactivity concentration, revealed an inversely proportional relation between grain size and a linear combination of measured specific activities of Ra-226, Th-232 (Ac-228, Bi-212 and Pb-212), K-40 and (CS)-C-137.

Identification of the fuel parts of research reactors	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								It is proposed that a database on the characteristics of research reactor fuel be constructed. This database will permit determining the unknown fuel and the unknown parts of the core. Arduous and precision methods are not needed to identify the fuel parts of pulsed reactors. Inspection and measurements of the geometric dimensions are sufficient in most cases. If a fuel part of a reactor is destroyed and has been converted to scrap, then the enrichment of the fuel, the isotopic composition of the uranium, and the impurity composition must be measured, although even this does not always solve the problem. Consequently, the selection and validation of the identifying indications must be the subject of special investigations.								Bagdasarov Yu.

Investigation of the elemental composition of surrogates of fuel-containing materials by nuclear microanalysis	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								Nuclear microanalysis was used to determine the elemental composition of individual components of the batch for synthesizing surrogates for the lava-like fuel-containing mass and to determine the composition of the surrogates themselves. The elemental composition of the surrogates obtained is compared with that of the real materials. Brown surrogates are found to contain uranium in amounts exceeding 8 mass %. It is found that the elemental composition of the surrogates is nonuniform in different sections of a slab; this could be an indication of incomplete melting of the batch components or the presence a temperature gradient in the heating facility. The decrease of the initial mass of the batch during vacuum melting is due to silicon, calcium, iron, and oxygen losses.

Efficiency of uranium coatings in a cylindrical laser-active element	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article							ENERGY DEPOSITION	A method for determining the efficiency of a uranium coating experimentally is proposed. The basis of the method is measuring the spectrum of the fission fragments. Measurements for different uranium coatings in a cylindrical laser-active element and experimental and computational data on their efficiency are presented. Comparing the experimental data with the calculations conclusions are drawn about the quality of the coatings obtained and the possible influence of the coating thickness on the energy and the laser beam.

Method for assessing the consequences of radiation accidents in the rooms of a power-generating unit of a nuclear power plant with a VVER-1000 reactor	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								Monte-Carlo estimation of the dose rate of external radiation from volume and surface sources of a gas-aerosol radioactive impurity, arising in the rooms of a power-generating unit during a radiation accident at a nuclear power plant, is examined. The volume and surface sources are distributed uniformly. The radial distribution of the dose buildup factor and the dose rate are obtained as functions of the gamma-ray energy at different heights. The calculations are performed for distances no more than four gamma-ray mean-free path lengths (mu d <= 4) by the local flux estimation method. Comparisons with similar calculations performed with computer programs employing the discrete-ordinate method show satisfactory agreement.

Decontamination and decommissioning in the Nuclear Research Institute Rez plc	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article								The Nuclear Research Institute Rez (NRI) is a leading institution in the area of Decontamination and Decommissioning in the Czech Republic. The NRI has maintained a dominant position in the nuclear program of the former Czechoslovakia since it was established in 1955 as a state-owned research organization. In December 1992 the NRI has been transformed into a joint-stock company. The Institute's activity encompasses nuclear physics, radiochemistry, experiments at the research reactor and many other topics. At present, research activities are mainly targeted at assisting the nuclear safety regulating body, power plant operator and nuclear facilities contractors. Significant attention is also paid to the use of nuclear technology outside the nuclear power sector. NRI operates 2 research nuclear reactors, hot cell facility, research laboratories, technology for radioactive waste management, radionuclide irradiators, and others. After 50 years of activities in the nuclear field, there are many environmental liabilities that shall be remedied. Such remedies are broken down to three areas: 1. Decommissioning of old obsolete facilities (e.g. decay tanks, liquid RAW storage tanks, old RAW treatment technology, special sewage system), 2. Processing of RAW resulting from operation and dismantling of nuclear facilities and 3. Elimination of spent fuel from research nuclear reactors. The goal is to remedy the environmental liabilities and eliminate the potential negative impact on the environment. Remediation of the environmental liabilities started in 2003 and should be finished in 2012.

Cutting and decontamination technologies for low-cost demolition of nuclear facilities	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								One of the most demanding jobs in demolishing nuclear power plants is the disassembly of large components which had been exposed to radiation. The mechanical cutting techniques used in manufacturing result in high process forces and require very accurate control. Mechanical processes are relatively easy to run by remote control. This makes a large number of disassembly techniques available which are characterized by specific pros and cons. The thermal cutting techniques, referred to as plasma fusion cutting and contact arc metal cutting (CAMC), contact arc metal grinding (CAMG) and water abrasive jet cutting, are characterized by low restoring forces. Especially CAMC, CAMG, and WAS cutting can be used on more complex and thick-walled structures. These processes can also be employed with thicker materials and complex geometries and can be operated with relatively simple manipulator systems. In addition to cutting, abrasion processes play a decisive role in demolition. The volume of radioactive waste arising, which is a key cost factor, can be greatly reduced by abrading only the functional layers, such as protective paint coats, or the top layers of solid materials.

The plasma plant of ZWILAG AG technology for the treatment of nuclear plant waste	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								ZWILAG AG Zwischenlager Wurenlingen A G, Switzerland, in addition to storage and conditioning plants for all categories of radioactive waste, also runs a plasma plant which has been in operation since 2004, dealing with low-level radioactive waste arising from the operation of Swiss nuclear power plants and in medicine, industry, and research. The plasma plant treats low-level radioactive waste with a high-performance plasma torch which decomposes the waste charges thermally or melts them. The chemically highly resistant final product is ready for direct disposal without requiring any further treatment steps. The main advantage of this approach is the fact that a single process is sufficient for all types of waste, whether organic, inorganic, liquid or solid. By the spring of 2007, the plasma plant had successfully completed six processing campaigns. The average volume reduction achieved across all these campaigns is approx. 6:1.
