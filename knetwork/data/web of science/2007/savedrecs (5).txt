Incorporation of hydrogen in carbon-tungsten co-deposition layers formed by hydrogen plasma sputtering	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion Energy	NOV 12-16, 2006	Albuquerque, NM				RE-DEPOSITION LAYER; RF PLASMA; DEUTERIUM RETENTION; ASDEX-UPGRADE; CARBIDE	Carbon based material and tungsten are used in ITER as plasma facing materials in the divertor region. Presumably, carbon-tungsten mixed materials will be formed on the surface of the inner components of the vacuum vessel. Therefore, it is necessary to understand incorporation phenomena of hydrogen into carbontungsten mixed materials. In this study, carbon-tungsten co-deposition layers were formed by sputtering method using hydrogen RF plasma. Hydrogen incorporation was investigated as a function of atomic ratio of carbon and tungsten contained in the layer. The obtained hydrogen retention was in the range between 0. 16 and 0.83 as HI(C+W). The carbon ratio dependence on hydrogen incorporation was not observed It was found that the release behavior of the incorporated hydrogen changes depending on the atomic ratio of C and W in the layer.

Erosion behavior of carbon deposition layers formed by hydrogen plasma sputtering	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion Energy	NOV 12-16, 2006	Albuquerque, NM				LAMINAR PREMIXED FLAMES; FUSION MACHINES; TRITIUM RELEASE; DIVERTOR REGION; 1ST WALL; TILES; JT-60U; GRAPHITE; DETRITIATION; PROFILES	The erosion of carbon deposition layers by oxygen exposure and the desorpstion of hydrogen retained in the layers were investigated experimentally. Carbon deposition layers were formed by a sputtering method using hydrogen RF plasma. The layers were exposed to an argon gas with oxygen of 1013 Pa in the temperature range of 200 - 400 degrees C. The erosion reaction progressed quickly within 10 minutes and then decelerated rapidly. The measurement of the outlet concentration revealed that most of the layer was eroded not as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide but as soot. Additionally, it was estimated that the soot was released from the carbon deposition layer with a large amount of hydrogen.

Recent activities on tritium technologies for ITER and fusion reactors at JAEA	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion Energy	NOV 12-16, 2006	Albuquerque, NM				CO-DEPOSITED LAYERS; RADIOCHEMICAL REACTIONS; WATER ELECTROLYZER; TRITIATED-WATER; CARBON; DURABILITY; MEMBRANE; RECOVERY; REMOVAL; SYSTEM	The design studies of Atmosphere Detirtiation System (ADS) have been carried out in Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) as a contribution of Japan to ITER. The performance of ADS has also been investigated under accidental conditions such as fire and co-existing of a poison gas for catalyst like SF6. There is no degradation of Detritiation Factor (DF) under co-existing of CO or CO2 up to 20% as a simulated fire condition. However, only 0.1% of SF6 degrades the DF from more than 1000 to 50, following reduction of water by SF4 etc. (decomposition products of SF6) at 773K of catalyst bed. For the tritium processing technologies, our efforts have been focused on the R & D of the tritium recovery system of breeding blanket. In case of ITER Test Blanket Module, a cryogenic molecular sieve bed system was designed and demonstrated. Furthermore, electrochemical pumping system using a proton conductor is also investigated to design more effective system. The durability of electrolysis cell for Water Detritiation System (WDS) has been investigated and it is expected that the cell can endure more than 3 years' operation under the ITER WDS design condition. A series of fundamental studies on tritium safety technologies has been carried out as another major activity of JAEA for ITER and future fusion demo reactors. Tritium behavior in various confinement materials, tritium monitoring & accountancy, and detritiation were studied under collaboration programs with universities, using Caisson Assembly for Tritium Safety study.

Modeled tritium inventories within the ITER fuel cycle systems in typical fuelling scenarios	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion Energy	NOV 12-16, 2006	Albuquerque, NM				PUMPS	During plasma operation of ITER in the DT phase, tritium will be distributed in the different subsystems of the fuel cycle; tritium inventories within the systems are not constant, but vary as the gas moves through these systems during the burn and dwell periods. To evaluate the tritium content in each sub-system of the fuel cycle of ITER, a dynamic model for tritium inventory calculation was developed. The code reflects the design of each system in various degrees of detail; both the physical processes characteristics and in some cases the associated control systems are modeled. The amount of tritium needed for ITER operation has a direct impact on the tritium inventories within the fuel cycle subsystems. As ITER will function in pulses, the main characteristics that influence both the maximum value of tritium inventories in the systems and the rapid tritium recovery from the fuel cycle as necessary for refueling are discussed. Eventually the inventories in the Isotope Separation System (as the system with the highest tritium inventory) for short and long pulses and their dependence on the packing molar inventory are presented.

Integrated tests of water detritiation and cryogenic distillation in view of ITER design	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion Energy	NOV 12-16, 2006	Albuquerque, NM					One of the main concerns related to licensing of ITER is the amount of potentially tritium release into the environment and the qualification of the barriers against tritium release. The final barrier of tritium release from fuel cycle is the Water Detritiation System (WDS) which will be operated in combination with the Isotope Separation System (ISS). To investigate the performances of various components of these systems, an experimental facility based on Combined Electrolysis Catalytic Exchange (CECE) process with a Cryogenic Distillation (CD) process was built at Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe. The investigations are focused on two main issues: to quantify the separation performances of deuterium and tritium within the Liquid Phase Catalytic Exchange (LPCE) and CD processes in steady state and in dynamic mode of operation and to develop an integrated control system to be used in ITER ISS, in order to minimize the tritium inventory and to reduce at maximum extent the tritium releases. At TLK the two systems, CECE and CD have been commissioned and the experimental program and preliminary functionality tests of the main components are presented.

Recovery of tritium from flibe blanket in fusion reactor	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion Energy	NOV 12-16, 2006	Albuquerque, NM				MOLTEN-SALT FLIBE; HYDROGEN-FLUORIDE; SOLUBILITIES; DEUTERIUM; BEHAVIOR; BREEDER; LI2BEF4; REDOX	The present paper is to describe the behavior of tritium in Flibe as a self-cooled liquid blanket of a fusion reactor quantitatively. In order to avoid the generation of corrosive TF, Flibe is maintained under reduction atmosphere to transform TF to T-2 to keep a faster reaction rate compared with a residence time in a self-cooled blanket. The most important point is to clarify whether or not the redox control of Flibe can be achieved by Be rods inserted in a blanket within a limited contact time. The dissolution rate of a Be rod and the TF reduction reaction rate of Be + 2TF = BeF2 + T-2 in Flibe were experimentally determined under the JUPITER-II collaboration work. Close agreement was obtained between experiment and our simplified complete-mixing model. Especially, the reaction between Be and F- ion immediately after the contact was found to be limited by diffusion of F- ion. The behavior of tritium generated in a Flibe fuel cycle was simulated under a Flibe flow condition of FFHR-2.

Among the possible solutions to this issue would be to control REDOX not by Be but by addition of MoF6 or WF6 enhancing the reaction from T-2 to TF. The present study investigated feasibility of this procedure by thermodynamic and neutronics calculations. Using the blanket dimensions of Force Free Helical Reactor (FFHR), tritium inventory in V-alloy structure and Flibe were estimated based on the calculated equilibrium partial pressures of T-2 and TF in various cases of REDOX control by MoF6 or WF6. Also carried out were neutronics examinations for the impact of Mo or W doping in the blanket. The results showed that the tritium inventory in the blanket area would be less than 100g at the TF level of 0.1 and 1 ppm in Flibe with addition of WF6 and MoF6, respectively. WF6 doping is far more advantageous than MoF6 doping for low activation purposes.

Tritium behavior on the water-metal boundary for the permeation into cooling water through metal piping	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion Energy	NOV 12-16, 2006	Albuquerque, NM				FUSION DEMO PLANT; SUPERCRITICAL WATER; JAERI; DESIGN; STEEL	In order to accumulate data on tritium transferred to cooling. water of a fusion reactor, a series of experiments of tritium permeation into water jacket pressurized to 0.8MPa by He gas was performed through pure iron piping, which contained about I kPa of pure, tritium gas at 423 K. Chemical forms of tritium permeated into water were monitored periodically under continuous purging water jacket by He. Observation of metal surface was also carried out periodically by SEM and XRD analysis. The actual tritium permeation rate was about 115 level of the calculated value. Even if surface oxide layer (magnetite, porous & fine layers) grew in the water boundary, tritium permeation rate to water was not changed drastically. On the other hand, hydrogen gas (HT) fraction of tritium permeated in water jacket decreased drastically with oxide layer growth. Furthermore, permeated species and amounts were not affected clearly by the dissolved hydrogen in water by purging 1% H-2 in He.

Tritium should be well-controlled and not excessively released to the environment and to prevent workers from excess exposure. Especially, the hot cell and tritium facilities of ITER will use various construction materials such as the organic materials. The hot cell is maintained in the dry atmosphere very much, and the maintenance of the apparatus contaminated by high concentration tritium is assumed. Therefore, the hot cell may be contaminated by high concentration tritium. Since the epoxy paint which will be used as a paint on the wall of the hot cell was contaminated by tritium compared with metal material, it is very important to study the efficient decontamination of the epoxy paint from a viewpoint of the protection the excess exposure of the workers. For tritium decontamination processes, so-called 'soaking' effect is important. This effect is based on sorption of tritiated water vapor on the materials and subsequent desorption from them. Therefore, in order to develop for the optimal decontamination technique, the decontamination experiment was carried out as a function of water vapor concentration in the purge gas (N-2) for epoxy paint, acrylic resin and butyl rubber. As the result, the desorption rate for the organic materials was evaluated by purging gas of N-2, and then furthermore, the residual tritium on the organic materials was quickly removed by adding water vapor in purging gas. The effect of adding water vapor was found on the decontamination for the organic materials.

The representative decomposition products such as H-2 in the gas phase and H2O2 in the liquid phase were measured periodically, storing HTO in a leak-tight vessel. The effective production rate of H-2 increased with tritium concentration, however, the normalized production rate by tritium decay, like effective G-value, decreased with tritium concentration. The effective production rate of H2O2 also increased with tritium concentration and the normalized one also decreased under consideration of its natural decomposition rate, though it thought that the almost H2O2 calculated by the reported G-value decomposed by extra stimulus in tritiated water. The effective production rates of H-2 and H2O2 increased with temperature.

The equilibrium pressure (P) of hydrogen metal system has large isotope effect such as PH2 < PD2 < PT2 for ZrCo, however, the difference of H,D isotope fractions was within about 5 %, during rapid delivery of about 90% hydrogen gases at 623 K and initial H:D of 1:1. In cases of initial H:D of 9:1 or 1:9, the differences of H,D isotope fractions were rather small of a few %. Even if the fluctuation of the isotope ratio is less than 5%, depending on the requirements from plasma physics experiments and fuel accountancy of tritium plant, batch fuel delivery from adequate gas tanks after isotope composition adjustment will be preferable to direct rapid delivery from storage bed	Japan Atom Energy Grp, Directorates Fus Energy Res, Tritium Technol Grp, Toka, Ibaraki 3191195, Japan	Hayashi, T (reprint author), Japan Atom Energy Grp, Directorates Fus Energy Res, Tritium Technol Grp, Toka, Ibaraki 3191195, Japan.	havashi.takumi@jaea.go.jp					Besserer U, 2002, FUSION SCI TECHNOL, V41, P793; Hayashi T, 2005, FUSION SCI TECHNOL, V48, P317; Hayashi T, 2002, FUSION SCI TECHNOL, V41, P801; Hayashi T, 1998, FUSION TECHNOL, V34, P510; HEICS AG, 1992, FUSION TECHNOL, V21, P1030; ITER EDA, 2002, ITER EDA DOC SER, V24; Lasser R, 2002, FUSION SCI TECHNOL, V41, P854; Lasser R, 2002, FUSION SCI TECHNOL, V41, P520; Nishi M, 2006, FUSION ENG DES, V81, P745, DOI 10.1016/j.fusengdes.2005.08.052; PENZHORN RD, 1990, J NUCL MATER, V170, P217, DOI 10.1016/0022-3115(90)90292-U	10	7	7	1	3	AMER NUCLEAR SOC	LA GRANGE PK	555 N KENSINGTON AVE, LA GRANGE PK, IL 60526 USA	1536-1055			FUSION SCI TECHNOL	Fusion Sci.

The detritiation system consists of two oxidation catalyst beds (473K and 773K) for converting hydrogen isotopes and tritiated methane in compounds to water vapor and a bubbler for removing water vapor. SF6 gas is used as an electric insulation gas of Neutral Beam Injection system (NBI) in ITER, and is expected to be released in an accident such as fire. In this time, the performance of oxidation catalyst bed of the detritiation system for hydrogen under existence of SF6 which are released from NBI was investigated. The SF6 gas was notably decomposed in the case of the catalyst bed temperature higher than 623K In addition, when 0.05% or more of SF6 was introduced with 1% of hydrogen, a part of the water produced by the 473K catalyst bed was reduced to hydrogen due to the reaction with the decomposed gas in SF6. Consequently, the detritiation factor (D.F.) of the detritiation system was decreased to less than 50 from > 10000 of its initial value. Since the effect of SF6 depends on its concentration closely, the amount of SF6 released into the tritium handling area in an accident should be reduced by some ideas of the arrangement of components using SF6 in the buildings.

Engineering issues facing transmutation of actinides in Z-pinch fusion power plant	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion Energy	NOV 12-16, 2006	Albuquerque, NM				REACTORS	The initiation of the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership includes nuclear-based transmutation devices to recycle the spent fuel. Fusion can offer an alternative to the use of fast reactors for the transmutation of actinides. At a modest fusion power of 20 W, a Z-Pinch driven sub-critical blanket can burn actinides and produce power. Several engineering issues have been examined: the effect of the sub-critical blanket and its internal fission neutrons on tritium breeding, radiation damage to structure, energy deposition and extraction, and chamber activation. Our initial assessment indicates the Z-Pinch could be an attractive option for burning actinides, but special attention should be paid to the challenging engineering, issues.

J	Moussa, HM				Moussa, H. M.			Dust particle size effects on absorbed fraction values in the anterior nose	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						aerosols; Monte Carlo; inhalation; electrons		The respiratory tract model introduced in Publication 66 of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) includes consideration of extrathoracic airways, referred to as the ET region. This region comprises the anterior nose and the posterior nasal passages, larynx, pharynx, and the mouth. The deposition of inhaled particles in the airways depends on the thermal and aerodynamic properties of the particles and equations are presented to calculate the deposition efficiency in the various regions of the tract. In its dosimetric model the ICRP assumes that none of the energy emitted by the deposited source is lost in the particles itself (i.e., no self attenuation) and the deposition is assumed to be on the inner surface of the airway of the anterior nose. Therefore, the effects of various dust particle sizes on the energy deposition in the epithelium as characterized by the absorbed fraction in the anterior nose region were not addressed in ICRP 66. Since radioactive particulate matter is carried in air within dust particles, this subject should be addressed. In this paper the effects of dust particle sizes (various equivalent volume diameters) on the absorbed fraction to the anterior nose are studied using a truncated cone model for the anterior nose. The results indicate that attenuation in the dust particles has a significant effect on the electron absorbed fraction. This effect depends on the dust particle size and the energies of the electrons emitted by the radionuclides carried within dust particles.

The camera comprises a 5 x 5 cm(2) field of view NaI (TI) pixellated crystal array, a high sensitivity lead (2.0 cm thick) hexagonal parallel-hole collimator, a position sensitive photomultiplier tube (PSPMT), and a novel highly multiplexed electrical readout. The intrinsic energy resolution (12.1 +/- 2.0%) at 140 keV including edge crystals, extrinsic sensitivity (5 cps/mu Ci from 1-5 cm with a 24% energy window) and extrinsic spatial resolution (1.81 +/- 0.1 mm at 0.6 cm) facilitate rapid identification of a radioactive node. Using a node phantom we performed an ideal observer study to estimate the delectability of small spheres in the range of 3 mm to 8 nun with different exposure times. With a 5 seconds exposure the camera can detect a 3 nun diameter sphere at a depth of 3.6 cm containing 1 mu Ci of Tc-99m within a cold background, and a 4 mm diameter sphere containing 2 mu Ci at 2.6 cm depth within a warm background (> 10: 1 contrast) with a 5 second exposure duration.

The Pu-rich agglomerate parameters are defined based on the measurement data of MIMAS-MOX and the focus is on the highly enriched MOX fuel in accordance with increased burnup resulting in a higher volume fraction of the Pu-rich agglomerates. The lattice calculations with a heterogeneous fuel model and a homogeneous fuel model are performed simulating the PWR 17 x 17 fuel assembly. The heterogeneous model individually treats the Pu-rich agglomerate and U-Pu matrix, whereas the homogeneous model homogenizes the compositions within the fuel pellet. A continuous-energy Monte Carlo burnup code, MVP-BURN, is used for burnup calculations up to 70 GWd/t. A statistical geometry model is applied in modeling a large number of Pu-rich agglomerates assuming that they are distributed randomly within the MOX fuel pellet. The calculated nuclear characteristics include k-inf, Pu isotopic compositions, power density and burnup of the Pu-rich agglomerates, as well as the pellet-averaged Pu compositions as a function of burnup. It is shown that the effect of Pu-rich agglomerates on the lattice calculation is negligibly small.

J	Cho, DK; Lee, Y; Lee, JY; Choi, J				Cho, Dong-Keun; Lee, Yang; Lee, Jong-Youl; Choi, Jongwon			Characteristics of a geological disposal system for the increasing burn-up of spent nuclear fuel in Korea	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						spent fuel; high burn-up; geological disposal; structural analysis; shielding analysis; canister; repository		The characteristics of a geological disposal system that can accommodate increasingly higher burn-up levels of spent fuel were assessed based on the Korea reference disposal system concept. First, a status investigation that included a projection of spent fuel quantity versus burn-up was carried out to demonstrate the trend toward higher burn-up levels. Next, the main features of the Korea reference disposal system were introduced. Finally, the disposal tunnel length, excavation volume, and raw materials (e.g., a cast insert, copper, bentonite and backfill) necessary for a disposal system were comprehensively analyzed to define the characteristics and overall effects on geological disposal at increasingly higher burn-up levels. Our study determined that it is reasonable to use a canister containing 4 spent fuel assemblies with burn-up levels up to 50 GWD/MTU, while a canister containing 3 spent fuel assemblies can accommodate burn-up levels beyond 50 GWD/MTU. A remarkable increase of 33% in disposal tunnel length and that of 30% in excavation volume were observed as the burn-up increased from 50 to 60 GWD/MTU. However, this was offset by a reduction of 17% in raw materials used in canister fabrication. Therefore, it seems that spent fuel at increasingly higher burn-up levels is not a serious concern for deep geological disposal in Korea.

We studied the characteristics and behavior of the secondary products produced during cutting of highly radioactive metals using electric discharge machinery (EDM) underwater. The ratio of the weight of the aerosol produced to the melted weight of a workpiece that was cut using EDM, both with a Ag/W alloy electrode and a carbon electrode, was about 1 x 10(-3). The aerosol had a high concentration of manganese with a high vapor pressure. The production ratio was expressed as the aerosol production rate (ppm) = -4.6 x 10(-2) Tb + 1.4 x 10(2) (Tb: boiling point (K)). The EDM cutting produced metal vapors which condensed into particles. Air-borne nickel carbonyl was produced during the EDM cutting of nickel and carbon monoxide with a carbon electrode, and a high efficiency particulate air filter and a charcoal filter were used effectively. In the case of a Ag/W electrode, the swarf contained oxide particles of around 20 mu m and hydroxide particles with a diameter of around 10 mu m. The water clean-up system was able to purify water with over 95% filtration efficiency using a 1 mu m pore-pleated filter cartridge.

The ceramic cell tested here was composed of a SrZr0.9Yb0.1O3-a tube, one end of which was closed, and Ni/SiO2 and NiO/SiO2 porous electrodes. Its anode was supplied with moist CH4 or H-2 and its cathode with moist O-2. All of the j-V curves obtained by a direct-current method were correlated to the relation V = E-0 - jd/sigma at 600-700 degrees C regardless of the two different conditions of the CH4 + H2O and H-2 + H2O supply. The rate-controlling step of charged hydrogen ion transfer was determined from the dependences of the overall conductivity sigma and the electromotive force E-0 on the anode H2O partial pressure and temperature. The E-0 value under the condition of the CH4 + H2O supply was affected by the diffusion of reaction products of CH4 + H2O = CO + 3H(2) through the porous anode. On the other hand, the a value was limited by the oxygen reduction rate at the cathode interface between the ceramic and the Ni electrode regardless of the different conditions between CH4 + H2O and H-2 + H2O. These results were consistent with our results obtained by an alternating-current method. The activation energy of the overall conductivity was 60kJ/mol.

The stability constant value ( log beta(1)) for the 1 : 1 complex, NpO2( OSi( OH)(3)), was found to decrease with increase in ionic strength of the aqueous phase [ 6.83 +/- 0.01 at I = 0.10M to 6.51 +/- 0.02 at I = 1.00M]. These values have been fitted in the SIT model expression and compared with similar values of complexation of the metal ions Am3+, Eu3+, UO22+, PuO22+, Np4+, Ni2+ and Co2+.

Radioactivity levels and physical-chemical properties of public water supplies in Malaga	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; MINERAL WATERS; SURFACE; SPAIN	The measurements of radioactivity in drinking water enable us to determine the exposure of the population to radiation through their usual consumption of water. An intensive study of the water supply in the city of Malaga has been carried out to determine both the gross alpha- and gross beta- activity concentrations. Gamma spectrometry was used in order to detect certain types of radionuclides. Results indicated that 95% of the water tested contained a gross alpha- radioactivity of less than 0.1 Bq/ l, and 100% gross beta- activity of less than 1 Bq/ l - the activity limit recommended by the Spanish Regulatory Organization. Several factors were found to have an influence on radioactivity levels, such as total hardness, potassium and pH.

Studies of Sr-90 concentration and migration in the soils of the Leczna-Wodawa Lake District	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ENVIRONMENTAL-SAMPLES; CHERNOBYL FALLOUT; SEQUENTIAL EXTRACTIONS; RAPID-DETERMINATION; CS-137; RADIONUCLIDES; BYELARUS; AM-241; (CS)-C-137; SEPARATION	Research data on concentration and transportation of Sr-90 in cutivate soils and its migration in undisturbed from Leczna- Wlodawa Lake District are presented. 90Sr analysis was based on yttrium path. A special attention was paid to the precision in excluding of Th and U radioisotopes and their daughters using solid- liquid extraction ( on Dovex ionite), and Pb by PbI2 precipitation. The obtained results revealed various contamination of studied soils by 90Sr although its concentration did not exceed 10 Bq/ kg in the most samples. The highest concentration was noticed in upper 20 cm layers in both types of soils. Vertical migration rate of 90Sr, calculated from compartment model, was below 1 cm/ yr for the most researched soils.

Measurement of low levels of radioactivity with a large well germanium detector	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							AMERICIUM; PLUTONIUM; URANIUM; SAMPLES; AM-241	Described is the application of a state- of- the- art germanium detector containing a 25.4- mm diameter by 50- mm deep well for low- level activity gamma- spectrometry measurements. Detector calibration with examples of absolute efficiency curves at different in- well sample heights and the results of experiments to determine the effect of sample matrices to gamma- ray adsorption are presented. Radioanalytical methods described include the measurements of Am-241,Am-243: (1) in water samples after preconcentration and ( 2) in dissolved neodymium fluoride ( NdF3) microprecipitates. These procedures were achievable because of the well detector's ability to accommodate a relatively large sample volume. A rapid method for the dissolution of NdF3 microprecipitates for gamma counting is also described.

Feasibility studies to assess the use of Pu-236 as a radiochemical yield monitor in bioassay samples	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								Various plutonium compounds are handled in nuclear facilities of BARC. Hence, there is a possibility of occupational workers getting exposed to Pu. In vitro bioassay monitoring in which Pu is separated by chemical procedures from excreta samples and estimated by alpha- spectrometry, is the method of choice for the evaluation of internal dose to the occupational workers handling Pu. However, this method requires a suitable Pu tracer for reducing the uncertainties due to chemical yield in the separation, electro- deposition and counting efficiency. Pu-242 is commonly used as a tracer but due to its non- availability, efforts were made earlier to indigenously synthesis Pu-236 by proton irradiation of Np-237 in BARC- TIFR pelletron facility. The present study, reports the feasibility of using 236Pu as a radiochemical yield monitor ( tracer) in bioassay samples.

Rapid determination of Sr-89 and Sr-90 in radioactive waste using Sr extraction disk and beta-ray spectrometer	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							WATER	A rapid determination method in which beta-ray spectrometry was combined with solid phase extraction using Sr Rad Disk was developed for the determination of Sr-89 and Sr-90 in low- level radioactive waste. Various amounts of 89Sr, 90Sr, and Y-90 retained by the Sr Rad Disk was measured by a beta- ray spectrometer, and it was found that both Sr-89 and Sr-90 were simultaneously determined with < 30% error (2 sigma) at Sr-89/Sr-90 radioactivity ratio of 0.3 to 45. The present method was successfully applied to actual radioactive liquid waste samples arising from nuclear facilities in Japan Atomic Energy Agency. Strontium was simply separated from interfering nuclides such as Cs-137 and Eu-154, and matrix components by the Sr Rad Disk, and the results obtained by beta- ray spectrometry was in good agreement with that of the conventional analysis.

Complexation of plutonium(IV) with sulfate at variable temperatures	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							SOLVENT-EXTRACTION; STABILITY-CONSTANTS; AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; IONIC-STRENGTH; PU(IV); NP(IV)	The complexation of plutonium( IV) with sulfate at variable temperatures has been investigated by solvent extraction method. A NaBrO3 solution was used as holding oxidant to maintain the plutonium( IV) oxidation state throughout the experiments. The distribution ratio of Pu( IV) between the organic and aqueous phases was found to decrease as the concentrations of sulfate were increased. Stability constants of the 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 Pu( IV)HSO4 - complexes, dominant in the aqueous phase, were calculated from the effect of [ HSO4 -] on the distribution ratio. The enthalpy and entropy of complexation were calculated from the stability constants at different temperatures using the Van't Hoff equation.

Improved sample preparation method for environmental plutonium analysis by ICP-SFMS and alpha-spectrometry	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PLASMA-MASS SPECTROMETRY; EXTRACTION CHROMATOGRAPHY; NUCLEAR FORENSICS; ISOTOPE RATIOS; MARINE SAMPLES; SOIL SAMPLES; SEPARATION; ACTINIDES; MS; RADIONUCLIDES	A rapid and simple sample preparation method for plutonium determination in environmental samples by inductively coupled plasma sector field mass spectrometry ( ICP- SFMS) and alpha- spectrometry is described. The developed procedure involves a selective CaF2 co- precipitation for preconcentration followed by extraction chromatographic separation. The proposed method effectively eliminates the possible interferences in mass spectrometric analysis and also removes interfering radionuclides that may disturb alpha- spectrometric measurement. For Pu-239, Pu-240 and Pu-241 limits of detection of 9.0 fg. g(-1) ( 0.021 mBq), 1.7 fg. g(-1) ( 0.014 mBq) and 3.1 fg. g(-1) ( 11.9 mBq) were achieved by ICP- SFMS, respectively, and 0.02 mBq by alpha- spectrometry. Results of certified reference materials agreed well with the recommended values.

On-line separation of Pu(III) and Am(III) using extraction and ion chromatography	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PLASMA-MASS SPECTROMETRY; TRANSITION-METALS; TRIVALENT ACTINIDES; SOIL SAMPLES; THERMAL LENS; LANTHANIDES; COLUMN; AM; CHROMIUM(VI); PERFORMANCE	An on-line method developed for separating plutonium and americium was developed. The method is based on the use of HPLC pump with three analytical chromatographic columns. Plutonium is reduced throughout the procedure to trivalent oxidation state, and is recovered in the various separation steps together with americium. Light lanthanides and trivalent actinides are separated with TEVA resin in thiocyanate/ formic acid media. Trivalent plutonium and americium are pre- concentrated in a TCC- II cation- exchange column, after which the separation is performed in CS5A ion chromatography column by using two different eluents. Pu( III) is eluted with a dipicolinic acid eluent, and Am( III) with oxalic acid eluent. Radiochemical and chemical purity of the eluted plutonium and americium fractions were ensured with alpha- spectrometry.

Spectrophotometric determination of boron in nuclear grade uranium compounds with curcumin and studies on effect of HNO3	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							COMPLEX MATRICES; TRACE AMOUNTS; EXTRACTION; IRON; SEPARATION; CHLOROFORM; ACID	Detailed investigations have been carried out on the well-known method of spectrophotometric determination of boron particularly in uranium compounds as boron - curcumin complex after extraction into 2-ethyl hexane 1,3- diol ( EHD) to understand a number of parameters, which have not been addressed earlier in the literature. These include ( i) effect of different acid media on analytical results of boron which are employed for dissolution of nuclear fuel samples, ( ii) effect of diluents namely ethyl alcohol and N, N- dimethyl formamide on sensitivity of method which are employed for final dilution, and ( iii) studies on loss of boron, if any, during conversion of uranium compounds to U3O8. Based on the present studies, the existing procedure has been suitably modified to improve the sensitivity in the measurements. In addition, this paper also describes about interference studies with Al, Cr, Mg, Ca, Fe, Mn, Mo, F- and W and amount of EHD on modified method. Absolute detection limit was found to be 10 ng. The precision and accuracy of the method, is 3% at level 100 ng center dot g(-1) of boron.

The results show that the elements As, Br, Mo, Sb, Se, and U were enriched in the lignite samples, the elements Mo, Se and U in bottom ash, while fly ash samples were enriched in As, Mo, Sb, Se and U. Specific activity measurements also show that U-238 ( Ra-226) activity values in lignite and both ash samples were high relative to the corresponding data for coal and earth crust given in the literature.

Estimation of U-235 concentration in some depleted uranium samples by high resolution gamma-ray spectrometry using 185 keV and 1001 keV gamma-energies of U-235 and Pa-234m	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								The identification of isotopic composition of depleted uranium obtained after the reprocessing of spent fuel is very much important as far as their further applications are concerned. The concentration of U-235 in the reprocessed uranium will be lower and their depletion depends mainly on the type of the reactor and burn up. The depleted uranium has a variety of applications in nuclear fuel cycle operations and industries warranting quick assessment of its isotopic composition. This paper describes the methodology developed and used for the estimation of U-235 concentration in reprocessed uranium in the form of uranyl nitrate solution. A non destructive technique by high resolution gamma- ray spectrometry with HPGe detector has been used for the analysis. The activity ratio of U-238/U-235, obtained from the absolute activity measurement on the 185 keV gammaline of U-235 and 1001 keV gamma- line of Pa-234m, has been used for the estimation of 235U isotopic content in the sample using a mathematical formula. This method offers rapid and reliable estimate of the U-235 concentration in samples comparable with that of mass spectrometry measurements. The results show that U-235 concentration in the sample can be determined within 5% error for 10000 seconds counting.

Alpha emitters from uranium mining in the environment	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								Uranium mining and milling activities usually generate an enhancement of radionuclide concentrations in the environment that may cause increased radiological exposure to mankind. For risk assessment and radiological protection of man and environment in these areas, usually, it is needed to implement radiological surveillance of water, soils, agricultural products, aerosols, and mining waste discharges as well. Radionuclides to be monitored in priority are alpha- emitting nuclides of the uranium natural series. Radioactivity analysis of materials from uranium mining areas of Portugal shows departure from secular radioactive equilibrium amongst uranium series radionuclides, thus rendering invalid the assumption of equilibrium and requiring the actual determination of each radionuclide. Radionuclide measurements performed with high resolution alphaspectrometry, as reported herein, produce accurate results on specific radionuclides that are essential in computing radiation doses to critical groups of the population.

J	Verfondern, K; Nabielek, H; Kendall, JM				Verfondern, Karl; Nabielek, Heinz; Kendall, James M.			Coated particle fuel for high temperature gas cooled reactors	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						high temperature reactor; TRISO coated particle fuel; zirconium carbide	FABRICATION; ZRC	Roy Huddle, having invented the coated particle in Harwell 1957, stated in the early 1970s that we know now everything about particles and coatings and should be going over to deal with other problems. This was on the occasion of the Dragon fuel performance information meeting London 1973: How wrong a genius be! It took until 1978 that really good particles were made in Germany, then during the Japanese HTTR production in the 1990s and finally the Chinese 2000-2001 campaign for HTR-10. Here, we present a review of history and present status. Today, good fuel is measured by different standards from the seventies: where 9*10(-4) initial free heavy metal fraction was typical for early AVR carbide fuel and 3*10(-4) initial free heavy metal fraction was acceptable for oxide fuel in THTR, we insist on values more than an order of magnitude below this value today. Half a percent of particle failure at the end-of-irradiation, another ancient standard, is not even acceptable today, even for the most severe accidents. While legislation and licensing has not changed, one of the reasons we insist on these improvements is the preference for passive systems rather than active controls of earlier times. After renewed HTGR interest, we are reporting about the start of new or reactivated coated particle work in several parts of the world, considering the aspects of designs/traditional and new materials, manufacturing technologies/quality control/quality assurance, irradiation and accident performance, modeling and performance predictions, and fuel cycle aspects and spent fuel treatment. In very general terms, the coated particle should be strong, reliable, retentive, and affordable. These properties have to be quantified and will be eventually optimized for a specific application system. Results obtained so far indicate that the same particle can be used for steam cycle applications with 700-750 degrees C helium coolant gas exit, for gas turbine applications at 850-900 degrees C and for process heat/hydrogen generation applications with 950 degrees C outlet temperatures. There is a clear set of standards for modem high quality fuel in terms of low levels of heavy metal contamination, manufacture-induced particle defects during fuel body and fuel element making, irradiation/accident induced particle failures and limits on fission product release from intact particles. While gas-cooled reactor design is still open-ended with blocks for the prismatic and spherical fuel elements for the pebble-bed design, there is near worldwide agreement on high quality fuel: a 500 pin diameter UO(2) kernel of 10% enrichment is surrounded by a 100 mu m thick sacrificial buffer layer to be followed by a dense inner pyrocarbon layer, a high quality silicon carbide layer of 35 mu m thickness and theoretical density and another outer pyrocarbon layer. Good performance has been demonstrated both under operational and under accident conditions, i.e. to 10% FIMA and maximum 1600 degrees C afterwards. And it is the wide-ranging demonstration experience that makes this particle superior. Recommendations are made for further work: 1. Generation of data for presently manufactured materials, e.g. SiC strength and strength distribution, PyC creep and shrinkage and many more material data sets. 2. Renewed start of irradiation and accident testing of modem coated particle fuel. 3. Analysis of existing and newly created data with a view to demonstrate satisfactory performance at burnups beyond 10% FIMA and complete fission product retention even in accidents that go beyond 1600 degrees C for a short period of time. This work should proceed at both national and international level.

The distribution information for actinides and rare earths in the reductive extraction systems of LiCl-KCl/Cd and LiCl-KCl/Bi was collected from literature and then it was used for the calculation of a multistage extraction. The results of the concentration profiles throughout the extraction cascade, recovery yields of various metal solutes, and separation factors between the actinides and rare earths were calculated. The effects of the major process parameters, such as reducing agent content in the metal phase, number of stages, and salt/metal flow ratio, etc., on the extraction behavior were also examined.

The activity amounts of Pu-238, Pu-239, Pu-240, Am-241, Cm-244 and Cm-242 were measured by alpha spectrometry using Pu-242 and Am-243 as tracers, respectively. A spike addition method for Np-237 was established by an alpha and gamma spectrometry using Np-239 as a spike after the optimum conditions for the measurements of Np-237 and Np-239, respectively, were obtained. A separation system using anion exchange chromatography and diethylhexylphosphoric acid extraction chromatography was applied for the separation of these elements. This method was applied to high-burnup spent nuclear fuel samples (40 similar to 60GWD/MTU). The contents of the transuranic elements were compared with those by ORIGEN-2 code. Measurements and the calculations of the contents of the plutonium isotopes Pu-238, Pu-239 and Pu-240 agreed to within 10% on average. The contents of Np-237 agreed to within approximately 5% except for one instance of a calculation, while those of Am-241, Cm-244 and Cm-242 showed higher values by approximately 19%, 35% and 14% on average, respectively, compared to the calculations according to the burnup.

These activities are called safeguards and involve inspections of spent nuclear fuel at nuclear power plants and storage facilities. At these inspections, various measuring techniques are employed for verifying the presence and identity of spent nuclear fuel assemblies. However, a fuel assembly contains about 100-300 fuel rods and techniques are also required for verifying that no individual fuel rods have been removed from the assembly. For this purpose, a non-destructive tomographic measurement technique for spent-fuel assemblies is being developed at Uppsala University, based on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The technique utilizes the gamma-ray emission from spent fuel. The first step of the methodology is the recording of the gamma-ray flux distribution in a large number of positions around the fuel assembly, using gamma-ray detectors attached to a collimator system. In the following step, a cross-sectional image of the source distribution in the fuel assembly is reconstructed. Because the fuel rods are highly activated during reactor operation, and because they are stored in water with practically no radioactive content, they appear very clearly in this type of image. The technique has earlier been used for determining the power distribution in fuel assemblies [S. Jacobsson Svard, A. Hakansson, et al., Nucl. Technol. 151(1) (2005) 70. [1]]. The images obtained in those measurements show that the technique also has great potential for safeguards' application. In the on-going development of the technique specifically for safeguards, image analysis plays an important role. Some crucial points in the analysis are the identification and positioning of the assembly in the image and also the definition of the background activity level. Finally, proper criteria have to be set for confidently stating if a fuel rod would be considered to be missing. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The method utilized is based on determining the probabilities for a-particles emitted by the uranium and thorium series inside the studied materials to reach and be registered on the CR-39 and LR-115 type II SSNTDs and counting the resulting track densities. Total daily intakes of U-238 and Th-232 for a typical food basket were estimated to be 1.27 Bq d(-1) and 0.95 Bq d(-1), 1.55 Bq d(-1) and 1.18 Bq d(-1) and 2.01 Bq d(-1) and 1.52 Bq d(-1) for the 7-12 y, 12-17 y and adults age groups, respectively. Annual committed equivalent doses were evaluated in the human body compartments of members of the Moroccan rural population due to U-238 and Th-232 from the ingestion of the studied food materials by using the ICRP ingestion dose coefficients. Annual committed effective dose due to U-238 and Th-232 intakes were found to be 3.16 x 10(-5) Sv and 10.10 x 10(-5) Sv, 3.81 x 10(-5) Sv and 10.80 x 10(-5) Sv and 3.32 x 10(-5) Sv and 12.80 x 10(-5) Sv for the 7-12 y, 12-17 y and adults age groups, respectively.

The method proposed for explosive and fissile material detection makes use of two sensors (X-rays and neutrons). A commercial imaging device based on the X-ray radiography performs a fast scan of the container, identifies a "suspect" region and provides its coordinates to the neutron based device for the final "confirmatory" inspection. In this two sensor system a 14 MeV neutron beam defined by the detection of associated alpha particles is used for interrogation of only volume elements marked by X-ray sensor. The object's nature is determined from passive and neutron induced, gamma energy spectra measurements. Experimental results (time-of-flight and gamma energy spectra) obtained for the irradiation 30 kg of TNT, depleted uranium and other materials hidden inside the container are presented.

The efficiency of the detector should be calibrated for each geometry considered. Simulation of the calibration procedure with a validated computer program is an important auxiliary tool for environmental radioactivity laboratories. The MCNP code based on the Monte Carlo method has been applied to simulate the detection process in order to obtain spectrum peaks and determine the efficiency curve for each modelled geometry. The source used for measurements was a calibration mixed radionuclide gamma reference solution, covering a wide energy range (50-2000 keV). Two measurement geometries - Marinelli beaker and Petri boxes - as well as different materials - water, charcoal, sand - containing the source have been considered. Results obtained from the Monte Carlo model have been compared with experimental measurements in the laboratory in order to validate the model. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The researched location was divided in three specific parts: (i) regulated area with the bottom ash and flying ash in the basis ("old" depot), (ii) unregulated area with waste materials, including bottom ash and flying ash, in the basis ("new" depot), (iii) uncontaminated area with no waste materials deposited on. Average radon concentration on a ground level was 213 Bq/M-3 for the "old" depot, 214 Bq/M3 for the "new" depot and 59 Bq/M3 for the uncontaminated area and at the height of 1.5 m 20 Bq/M3 for the "old" depot, 34 Bq/M3 for the "new" depot and 26 Bq/M3 for the uncontaminated area. Average total gamma radiation values in selected energy range were 109.92 cps (counts per second) for the "old" depot, 357.76 cps for the "new" depot and 65.97 cps for the uncontaminated area. For selected radionuclides (Pb-214, (137)cS, Ac-228, Pa-234m K-40 and Bi-214) average gamma radiation values at characteristic energies have been determined as well. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The Monte Carlo code CEARCPG for coincidence prompt gamma-ray neutron activation analysis	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th Topic Meeting on Industrial Radiation and Radioisotope Measurement Applications	JUN 20-24, 2005	Hamilton, CANADA			coincidence; PGNAA; Monte Carlo; CEARCPG	PGNAA APPLICATIONS; SPECTRA	Prompt gamma-ray neutron activation analysis (PGNAA) is widely used to determine the elemental composition of bulk samples. The detection sensitivities of PGNAA are often restricted by the inherent poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). There are many sources of noise (background) including the natural background, neutron activation of the detector, gamma-rays associated with the neutron source and prompt gamma-rays from the structural materials of the analyzer. Results of the prompt gamma-ray coincidence technique show that it could greatly improve the SNR by removing almost all of the background interferences. The first specific Monte Carlo code (CEARCPG) for coincidence PGNAA has been developed at the Center for Engineering Application of Radioisotopes (CEAR) to explore the capabilities of this technique. Benchmark bulk sample experiments have been performed with coal, sulfur, and mercury samples and indicate that the code is accurate and will be very useful in the design of coincidence PGNAA devices.

Secondary neutron-production cross sections from heavy-ion interactions between 230 and 600 MeV/nucleon	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							NEON IONS; TRANSPORT CODE; CARBON; COLLISIONS; ALUMINUM; URANIUM; HELIUM; YIELDS; SPACE; WATER	Secondary neutron-production cross sections have been measured from interactions of 230 MeV/nucleon He, 400 MeV/nucleon N, 400 MeV/nucleon Kr 400 MeV/nucleon Xe, 500 MeV/ nucleon Fe, and 600 MeV/nucleon Ne interacting in a variety of elemental and composite targets. We report the double-differential production cross sections, angular distributions, energy spectra, and total cross sections from all systems. Neutron energies were measured using the time-of-flight technique and were measured at laboratory angles between 5 and 80 deg. The spectra exhibit behavior previously reported in other heavy-ion-induced neutron-production experiments, namely, a peak at forward angles near the energy corresponding to the beam velocity, with the remaining spectra generated by pre-equilibrium and equilibrium processes. The double-differential spectra are fitted with a moving-source parameterization. Observations on the dependence of the total cross sections on target and projectile mass are discussed.
