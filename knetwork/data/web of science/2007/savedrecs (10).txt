This is mainly due to the narrow dynamic range of a single detector systems. A significant improvement in mass spectrometric determination of U-236/U-238 ratio has been achieved by employing an alternate method using a single Faraday detector of narrow dynamic range. The method makes use of the precise measurements of the U-236/U-234 ratio, U-234/U-235 ratio and U-235/U-238 ratio, which are used to calculate the U-236/U-238 ratio using the equation U-236/U-238=U-236/(234)Ux(234)U/(235)Ux(235)U/U-238. Despite the fact that correlation of the data tends to increase the uncertainty in the result, our results show a significant improvement, i.e., more than 8 times better precision in measuring the U-236/U-238 ratio with this method (sigma=3.98x10(08)) as compared to direct measurement of U-236/U-238 (sigma=3.104x10(-07)). The method widens the applicability of the single collector system with narrow dynamic range and it will potentially be helpful to improve the precision in the case of the static multi-collector system also. The objective of the present study was to compare the results of the same sample analyzed with the present alternate method and the direct method for precision.

Preliminary results of a small X-ray irradiator for equivalent dose estimation	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							LUMINESCENCE; THERMOLUMINESCENCE; SYSTEM	In most established method for luminescence dating, the ratio of Sr-90/Y-90 radionuclides has been employed to provide reference laboratory doses to sample. Recently a small X-ray irradiator (Varian VF-50J) was introduced as an alternative to the traditionally used radioactive sources. Test results are presented whether the use of the small X-ray irradiator is possible in the dating technique. Aspects of the assessment of the X-ray irradiator include consideration of the measured optically stimulated luminescence signal and the relationship between X-ray tube currents and dose rates, as well as the dependence of equivalent dose for various dose rates. The test performances are assessed in relation to use with heated quartz.

Accumulation of radiocesium by Pleurotus citrinopileatus species of edible mushroom	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								Pleurotus citrinopileatus, a species of edible mushrooms, is widely accepted food component, especially in Indian subcontinent. The accumulating susceptibility of this edible mushroom species towards long-lived radioisotopes of cesium was studied in controlled laboratory condition using the Cs-134 (T-1/2 = 2.06 y) radioisotope. It was observed that the experimental mushroom species accumulated Cs-134 and maximum accumulation took place in the cap portion. The pileus (cap)/stipes (stem) ratio of each Cs-134 accumulated mushroom sample was determined and found 2.22 +/- 0.74. The protein and fat fractions of the experimental mushroom species were extracted separately after accumulation of radiocesium and it was found that most of the radiocesium accumulation occurred in the protein fraction of the mushroom. The mushroom Pleurotus citrinopileatus which is white in color, turned completely black after radiocesium accumulation. The black mushroom so obtained was produced upto fourth generation by tissue culture method without using any radiocesium further. All the successors were found to be black indicating a permanent mutation of the mushroom species.

J	Zhang, HX; Yuan, JQ; Tao, ZY				Zhang Hongxia; Yuan Jieqiong; Tao Zuyi			Effects of phosphate and Cr3+ on the sorption and transport of Th(IV) on a silica column	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							IONIC-STRENGTH; CONTACT TIME; AMORPHOUS SILICA; THORIUM; ALUMINA; PH; ADSORPTION; DESORPTION; URANYL	Six column experiments were performed, and six breakthrough curves (BTCs) and six displacement (desorption) curves (DPCs) were obtained, which demonstrate the effects of phosphate and Cr3+ on the sorption and transport of Th(IV) on a silica column at pH 3.0 and Th(IV) concentration 8 center dot 10(-6) mol/l of the influent. It was found that in the presence of phosphate sorbed preliminarily on the silica column, the amount of Th(IV) sorbed on the silica column is significantly increased. The breakthrough is significantly delayed relative to those in the absence of phosphate; the effect of simultaneous injection of Cr3+ on Th(IV) breakthrough is not significant and while the maximum concentration of Th(IV) of BTC is significantly decreased and reached about 70% of the input concentration; a minor proportion of Th(IV) sorbed on the silica column in the presence or absence of phosphate is not readily displaced with 0.01 mol/l KNO3 aqueous solution at pH 3. Transport and sorption studies of Th(IV) are important, since all thorium isotopes are radioactive, and Th(IV) is an analogue of tetravalent actinides. There is a need to understand the potential for migration from radioactive waste storage and mill tilling sites.

Track etching characteristics of polyester track detector and its application to uranium estimation in seawater samples	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								Garware Polyester Film, an indigenously available material has been evaluated systematically as a nuclear track detector for the detection of fission fragments. The relative fission track detection efficiency of this film was found to be (86.0 +/- 4.0)%. The bulk etch rate, determined by the gravimetric method, was found to be 0.75 +/- 0.05 mu m/h. The track etch rate was determined as 15.0 +/- 1.5 mu m/h. This detector was employed for the estimation of uranium in seawater samples and the results obtained were compared with the results obtained by using the commonly used Lexan detector. Uranium fractions after chemical separation from seawater samples were also analyzed by alpha-spectrometry and neutron activation analysis techniques and the results were compared with that obtained by the fission track method. Fission track method has the advantage, as it does not require any chemical separation. The indigenously available polyester film (polyethylene terphthalate) appears to be a good substitute of Lexan as nuclear track detector.

ICP-MS analysis of plutonium activities and Pu-240/Pu-239 ratio in alpha spectrometry planchet deposits	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ISOTOPIC-RATIOS; SEDIMENT CORES; BLELHAM-TARN; AMERICIUM; SEPARATION; SAMPLES; SOILS	Plutonium isotopes were measured by alpha-spectrometry and ICP-MS in sediment samples from two European lakes: Blelham Tam in U.K. and Stechlin lake in Germany. The ICP-MS measurements were made after alpha-spectrometry counting of the planchets. The planchets were prepared by traditional electrodeposition method after radiochemical extraction, separation and purification of the Pu fraction. A short radiochemical separation using plutonium selective resin, between the two spectrometry measures, is presented. The results show that these two complementary methods are in good agreement, the plutonium activity concentrations are the same. Alpha-spectrometry allows the Pu-238 determination and ICP-MS individual measurement of Pu-239 and Pu-240. Pu-238/Pu239+240 and Pu-240/Pu-239 ratios are calculated to determine the plutonium contamination source. With the results of these two techniques, it could be demonstrate that the plutonium is of global fallout origin.

Physical and chemical forms of radionuclides of S-38, Cl-38, Cl-39, and Br-82, produced at a high-energy proton accelerator facility	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PARTICLE-SIZE DISTRIBUTION; TUNNELS; RADIOACTIVITY	High-energy protons and neutrons produce various radionuclides in the air, mainly through the nuclear spallation of atmospheric elements. Air samples were collected from the EP-2 tunnel of the KEK 12 GeV proton synchrotron facility with a filter pack, which consisted of a membrane filter for aerosols, a Na2CO3-impregnated filter for acidic gases, and an activated carbon fiber filter for non-acidic gases. Sulfur-38 was found on the membrane and Na2CO3-impregnated filters, Cl-38 and Cl-39 were on the membrane, Na2CO3- impregnated, and ACF filters, and Br-82 was only on the ACF filter. The results on the relative abundances of aerosol and gaseous acidic components have indicated that Cl-38 produced by thermal neutron capture, which is the main reaction for Cl-38 production in the EP-2 tunnel air, are likely not to be present as aerosol or acidic gas. This was similar to the case of Br-82 produced by thermal neutron capture.

The revised program for measurements in intense operation mode according to AVV-IMIS	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article								The monitoring program for measurements in intense operation mode has been revised recently by a working group at the Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Reactor Safety (BMU). The major issues of the revision are reported in this contribution. Measurements in intense operation must be appropriate for fast assessment of the radiological situation, for estimating the dose to the population and for decisions on countermeasures to minimize the dose. In order to meet these requirements the structure of the measurement program in intense operation mode was divided into three phases when different exposition paths are relevant: before and during dispersion of radioactive material, immediately after dispersion of radioactive material has ended and a late phase when contamination values have decreased in different environmental media. For each of these phases a special measurement program was defined that is tailored to achieve the above mentioned objectives. Minimum detectable activity concentrations were introduced similar to the measurement program in routine operation mode. They follow the intervention levels in the catalogue of countermeasures and maximum permitted values given by the European Union (EU) for food and animal feed. The minimum detectable activity concentrations were defined such that the detection of 1/10 of the intervention levels for countermeasures is ensured.								*BUND UMW NAT REAK, 1994, MESSPR NORM 1, P930; *BUND UMW NAT REAK, 1995, MESSPR INT 2, P261; *EUR COMM PROJ, 2000, 19144 EUR; *GRENZW RICHTW, 2003, FS03124AKU; JACOB P, 3391 GSF; *PTB, 1998, PTBRA165; 2006, ALLGEMEINE VERWALTUN; 2001, NATURSCHUTZ REAKTORS; 1986, GESETZ VORSORGENDEN	9	0	0	0	0	CARL HANSER VERLAG	MUNICH	KOLBERGERSTRASSE 22, POSTFACH 86 04 20, D-81679 MUNICH, GERMANY	0932-3902			KERNTECHNIK	Kerntechnik	AUG	2007	72	4					167	171				5	Nuclear Science & Technology	Nuclear Science & Technology	207TG	WOS:000249273400002

Early emergency response by means of dispersion forecasting - emergency management of the Deutscher Wetterdienst in the context of national and international agreements	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article								Based on results of the numerical weather forecast models; the DWD (Deutscher Wetterdienst, German Meteorological Service) is immediately able to calculate dispersion forecasts in the case of an emergency with an emission of radioactive inventory. This information is essential for the management of further countermeasures. There are legal agreements between the federal states of Germany and the Federal Government regulating the mutual aid. For the emergency preparedness system RODOS (Real Time Online Decision Support) the results of the numerical weather forecasts are provided and complemented by medium-range dispersion forecasts. In the framework of the German computer network IMIS (Integrated Measurement and Information System for the Surveillance of Radioactivity in the Environment) the results of trajectory calculations are presented graphically within 10 minutes, those from the LPDM (Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model) forecasts within 30 minutes. In case of a nuclear emergency, global distribution of information via the WMO (World Meteorological Organization) communication system GTS is part of international agreements between IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) and WMO, thus giving the DWD a key role. The commitments of the DWD in managing nuclear emergencies in the framework of national and international agreements are presented, as well as internal emergency arrangements.

Characterization of dose rate instruments for environmental radiation monitoring	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article							COSMIC-RADIATION; GROUND-LEVEL; DOSIMETRY; EXPOSURE	Any dose rate instrument used to monitor environmental radiation must be characterized with respect to its response to secondary cosmic radiation and terrestrial radiation. This requires calibrations using different photon radiation fields, the measurement of the instruments internal background and the exposure to secondary cosmic radiation. The methods developed within the cooperation between BfS and PTB are explained in detail by an intercomparison of instruments which are part of the German early warning network IMIS and a high-pressure ionization chamber which was used as the reference instrument. The measurements were performed at the PTB facilities for the dosimetry of environmental radiation. It is shown how the ambient dose equivalent rate of the terrestrial radiation is determined and how the sensitivity of an instrument to a radioactive cloud passing by can be investigated.

Longitudinal dispersion of radioactive substances in Federal waterways	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article								In the context of radioactivity monitoring in German Federal Waterways (BWStr) by the Federal Institute of Hydrology (BfG) according to the Precautionary Radiation Protection Act (StrVG), the prediction of the dispersion of radioactive substances in water is one of the key tasks. The aim is the forecasting of the longitudinal dispersion of concentrations of soluble hazardous substances in flowing water These predictions are based on the so-called dispersion tests with tritium as a tracer that the BfG has performed since 1980. Characteristic parameters like discharge-dependent flow velocities, dispersion and elimination constants related to emission sources or selected river sections are determined. They will serve as basis for a mathematical model to forecast discharge-dependent flow velocities, expected impact times, concentration maxima, and the duration of critical increases in concentrations. In the following, the results obtained till now from three investigation campaigns on the River Weser and its source rivers Werra and Fulda are described.

Harnessing monitoring measurements in urban environments for decision making after nuclear accidents	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article							GAMMA-EXPOSURES	This article gives an overview on the conceptual design of the Inhabited Areas Monitoring Module IAMM which will be introduced into European decision support systems for nuclear emergencies. It will improve the use of monitoring data of radioactive contamination in urban environments for decision making. IAMM converts the dated gamma dose rate (GDR) measurements from geo-referenced locations into maps of surface contamination with an enhanced spatial resolution. Depending on the availability of the monitoring data, IAMM relies on two modes of operation. If there are only a few measurements, these are taken to improve the maps from a deposition model using data assimilation. If the number of measurements is sufficient to apply spatial interpolation IAMM will rely entirely on monitoring data. Suitable geo-referenced data points will be interpreted by IAMM with respect to their detector environment using the concept of location factors. The endpoints of IAMM can be used directly for decision making or dose calculations with either simple dose models or the more refined EuRopean Model for INhabited areas (ERMIN).

J	Ali, F; Lu, LX				Ali, Fawaz; Lu, Lixuan			A method to eliminate the effect of radiation on thermocouple performance	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								In-core temperature measurements are pivotal in maintaining nuclear reactors in a safe state of operation. Thermocouples serve as the liaison in ensuring this safe state. The realization of the thermocouple's full potential is hindered by the fact that thermocouples cannot be situated in areas with high radiation fields. Radiation has the potential of generating voltages in the thermocouple wires, hence producing an error in the temperature transmitter output. In this paper, a mathematical model is developed to quantify the effect that radiation from the Canada Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) has on the thermocouple temperature reading. Subsequently, a method to offset the effect of radiation on the thermocouple is proposed. Simulation is performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed system. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Thermal experimental results on the prototype for high power neutron converter for low energy proton/deuteron beams	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						neutron sources; nuclear reaction; radioactive ion beams		In the framework of the European program aimed at the developing of a second generation radioactive ion beam (RIB) facility, the Legnaro National Laboratories (LNL) propose in the next few years the construction of a specialized national facility for RIB originated by fission fragments produced by fast neutrons (SPES). Protons/deuterons of 40MeV (150kW) will produce about 10(14) neutrons per second in a converter with energy centered at around 14 MeV which will induce fission in a suitable fissile target, with the aim of 1013 fissions per second at least. A rotating target includes the converter made of 13 C-based material or natural carbon (for proton and deuteron beams, respectively), and cooled mainly by thermal radiation. This paper presents the design of the prototype, as well as the thermal experimental results with high-power electron beams. The prototype comprises the carbon-made neutron converter mounted on the rotating metal disk of 30cm in diameter and designed to dissipate 50kW of beam power at nominal operation condition. The test consists of the prototype converter irradiation with the high-power electron beam (beam size below I cm) of the ELV-6 accelerator. The prototype successfully remained under nominal conditions. In addition, the prototype was submitted to a beam power of 70 kW, which exceeds of 40% the design power, without any appreciable damage on the converter material. The results are in good agreement with the numerical simulations. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Gueye, P				Gueye, Paul			Energy distribution mapping of beta radioactive sources	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						permanent magnets; beta emission; data acquisition; Monte Carlo simulation		We have developed a novel procedure in extracting the energy distribution of radioactive beta emitters that has a direct application in detector energy calibration. The method employs a highly non-uniform magnetic field from a permanent dipole magnet and an array of 12 0.1 x 0.1 x 31 cm(3) scintillating fibers. By scanning the radioactive source across the entire entrance face of the magnet and recording the exit position of the electrons on the dispersive plane, we generated a full 2D map of the energy-position correlation functions. By combining the ADC spectra and a Geant4 simulation of the experimental setup, we were able to reconstruct the entire energy spectrum of a 25 mu Ci Sr-90/Y-90 point source used within a 1.4% accuracy.

One of these reactions is Ti-nat(d, x)V-48 for which recommended cross section data are available in one of the databases of the International Atomic Energy Agency (http://www-nds.iaea.or.at/medical/). This database contains all together 22 monitor reactions for practical applications covering energy up to 100 MeV depending on the reactions. In the case of the Ti-nat(d, x)V-48 reaction recommended data are given in the 9-50 MeV energy interval because at the time of creation not precise enough experimental data were available to recommend values from threshold up to 9 MeV. In this work we measured the excitation function in this relevant low energy range, collected new experimental data and suggest high confidence recommended values for the missing low energy part of the monitor excitation function.

The new procedure based on the R/T-T relationship is a developed version of the R/T-method based on R/T-M-Pu calibration curve described in [C.T. Nguyen, J. Bagi, L. Lakosi, A novel method of quantitative assay of PuBe neutron sources by neutron coincidence technique, Nucl. Instr. and Meth. B 246 (2006) 409], utilizing Pu isotopic correlations;, here R, T, M-Pu are double count rate, single count rate and total Pu content, respectively. Accuracy of the method was found to be about 2-3% and 15% for Pu-239 component and Pu content, respectively. Measurement time as a function of detector efficiency is treated in detail. It is shown that in a system of frame, a transuranium neutron source can be characterized by a pair of coordinates [R/T, T]. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We focused on two beam stripping positions in the RIA heavy ion driver where benchmark currents of up to 5 particle mu A U-238 were projected at energies of 10.5 MeV/u and 85 MeV/u, respectively. In order to select feasible stripper materials, data from experiments with uranium beams at the Texas A&M cyclotron and the Gesellschaft fuer Schwerionenforschung (GSI) accelerator were evaluated. Based on these results thermal estimates for a possible design were calculated and cooling simulations with commercially available software performed. Additionally, we performed simulations with the GEANT4 code on evaluating the radiation environment for our beam stripping solution at the 85 MeV/u position in the RIA driver. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The physical properties of individual carbon nanotubes have been well established, equaling or surpassing electrical and thermal conductivity and mechanical strength of most other materials, graphite in particular. The handling and transport of such nanotube films, dry-mounted self-supporting on metal frames with several cm(2) of open area, is problem-free: the aerogel films having a volumetric density of about 1.5 mg/cm(3) survived the trip by car and air from Dallas to Oak Ridge without blemish. In this paper we will present the results of first tests of these nanotube films as electron stripper media in a tandem accelerator. The tests were performed in the Model 25 URC tandem accelerator of the Holifield radioactive ion beam facility (HRIBF) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. We will discuss the performance of nanotube films in comparison with chemical vapor deposition and laser-ablated carbon foils. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two schemes are taken into account for the RF system design. One is to use a RF generator of 150 kW to drive two 1/2 wavelength resonant cavities. The other is to use two RF generators of 100 kW to drive two 1/2 wavelength resonant cavities, respectively. For the second scheme two Dee accelerating electrodes are disconnected in the central region, but their accelerating voltages are kept in phase with the help of phase shifters and phase lock loops. In this paper, the design strategy for the RF system, which is very important for high current machine, will be given firstly.

Radiation response of industrial materials: Dose-rate and morphology implications	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	19th International Conference on Application of Accelerators in Research and Industry	AUG 20-25, 2006	Ft Worth, TX	Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Los Alamos Natl Lab, Natl Canc Inst, Oak Ridge Associated Univ, Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Sandia Natl Lab, Univ N Texas, AccSys Technol Inc, Comecer SRL, Natl Electrostat Corp, Synergy Vacuum			CROSSLINKING; POLYPROPYLENE	Industrial uses of ionizing radiation mostly rely upon high current, high dose-rate (100 kGy/s) electron beam (EB) accelerators. To a lesser extent, industry uses low dose-rate (2.8 x 10(-3) kGy/s) radioactive Cobalt-60 as a gamma source, generally for some rather specific purposes, as medical device sterilization and the treatment of food and foodstuffs. There are nearly nine times as many (similar to 1400) high current EB units in commercial operation than gamma sources (similar to 160). However, gamma sources can be easily scaled-down so that much research on materials effects is conducted using gamma radiation. Likewise, laboratories are more likely to have very low beam current and consequently low dose-rate accelerators such as Van de Graaff generators and linear accelerators. With the advent of very high current EB accelerators, X-ray processing has become an industrially viable option. With X-rays from high power sources, dose-rates can be modulated based upon accelerator power and the attenuation of the X-ray by the distance of the material from the X-ray target. Dose and dose-rate dependence has been found to be of consequence in several commercial applications which can employ the use of ionizing radiation. The combination of dose and dose-rate dependence of the polymerization and crosslinking of wood impregnants and of fiber composite matrix materials can yield more economically viable results which have promising commercial potential. Monomer and oligomer structure also play an important role in attaining these desirable results. The influence of morphology is shown on the radiation response of olefin polymers, such as ethylene, propylene and isobutylene polymers and their copolymers.

By heating or cooling a pyroelectric crystal such as lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) in a vacuum, a potential on the order of 100 kV can be generated. This potential is great enough to eject electrons from the crystal for the production of characteristic or bremsstrahlung X-rays, or to cause field ionization near a tip mounted to the crystal. By using the combined fields of two polarized crystals, the acceleration potential can be doubled, with one crystal acting as a particle emitter and the other crystal serving as a target. Such a paired-crystal system was used to generate X-rays with energies of greater than 200 keV, and can be used to fluoresce the K shell of thorium (Z = 92). An alternative use of pyroelectric sources is the field ionization of a dilute gas. If the positively-charged crystal is used to ionize a deuterium gas, and the target crystal is coated with deuterated target, the deuterium ions can be accelerated into the target at high enough energy to cause D-D fusion. Results verifying the production of D-D fusion neutrons from a pyroelectric source will be presented. Future applications of pyroelectric accelerator technology, such as the use of the electron beam for materials testing, will also be discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It aims at developing a Tagged Neutron Inspection System (TNIS) to detect illicit materials, such as explosives and narcotics, in cargo containers. Fast neutron induced reactions produce specific gamma-rays used to determine the chemical composition of the inspected material. The associated particle technique is employed to precisely locate the interaction points of the neutrons. A new deuterium-tritium neutron generator has been developed, including a pixelized alpha particle detector. The TNIS also comprises high-efficiency fast neutron and gamma-ray detectors, a dedicated front-end electronics and an integrated software to entirely drive the system and automatically process the data. Most components have been integrated during last months at Institute Ruder Boskovic, in Zagreb, Croatia. An overview of the TNIS and of its preliminary performances is presented.

The design of an acceleratordriven neutron source is described that utilizes the D(d,n) He-3 reaction to produce a forward directed beam of up to 8.5 MeV neutrons. The key components of the neutron source are a high-current radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) accelerator and a neutron production gas target. The 5.1 in long, 200 MHz RFQ accelerates a 40 mA deuteron beam from a microwave-driven ion source coupled to an electrostatic low energy beam transport (LEBT) system to 6 MeV. At a 5% duty factor, the time-average D+ beam current on target is 1.5 mA. A thin entrance window has been designed for the deuterium gas target that can withstand the high beam power and the gas,pressure. The source will be capable of delivering a flux > 1 X 10(7) n/(cm(2) s) at a distance of 2.5 m from the target and will allow full testing and demonstration of a cargo screening system based on neutron stimulated SNM signatures.

We describe the technique and show initial results using a low-dose 60-keV neutron beam. This technique produces a clear induced fission signal in the presence of small quantities of U-235. The technique has been validated with low-Z and high-Z cargo materials. The technique uses a forward-directed beam of 60-keV neutrons to induce fission in 235U. Detection of the fast fission neutrons with pulse-shape discriminating scintillators is then the signature for 235 U. The beam of neutrons is generated with a 1.93 MeV proton beam impinging on a natural lithium target. The proton beam is produced by a radio-frequency quadrupole LINAC. The 60 keV neutron beam is forward-directed because the Li-7(p,n) reaction is just above threshold for a proton energy of 1.93 MeV. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This is due in part to the cargo itself, which acts as an attenuator to any radiation that might signal its presence. In the nuclear car wash, beta-delayed high-energy gamma-rays following neutron-induced fission are utilized as this signal. The delayed gamma-rays above 3 MeV are highly penetrating and have energies above natural background radiation. In addition, the half-lives of most fission products emitting gamma-rays at these energies are less than 160 s, making it feasible to construct decay curves on a time scale which preserves the flow of commerce through the port. A particular goal of the project is to understand the rate of false alarms.

DDAA is based on conventional pulsed neutron source interrogation, employing typically low cost 14 MeV (d, T) generators. In DDAA, a neutron generator produces repetitive pulses of neutrons that are directed into an inspected cargo. As each pulse passes through the cargo, the neutrons are thermalized and absorbed. The population of thermal neutrons decays with the diffusion decay time of the inspected medium (the so called thermal neutron "die-away" time) on the order of hundreds of microseconds. If SNM is present, the thermalized neutrons from the source cause fissions that produce a new source of fast neutrons. These fast fission neutrons decay with a time very similar to that of the thermal neutron die away of the surrounding cargo. The sensitivity of DDAA for a given source of neutrons is greatly affected by the size, geometry, density and composition of the inspected cargo. The sensitivity is also affected by the reflection of neutrons from surfaces such as the ground, nearby walls or nearby cargo; these effects were studied. The ability of DDAA to detect enriched uranium sample in dense hydrogenous cargo, such as paper and wood is shown. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The PPA technique uses a pulsed electron accelerator to generate bremsstrahlung photons in order to fission nuclear materials. Delayed neutron radiation is then detected with helium-3 neutron detectors as evidence of the nuclear material presence. Two experimental tests were designed, setup and run to generate experimental data for benchmarking purposes. The first test irradiated depleted uranium in air, and the second test, depleted uranium in a simulated cargo container (plywood pallet), using 10 MeV electron pulses. Time-integrated, post-flash, delayed neutron counts were measured and compared to calculated count predictions in order to benchmark the calculational methodology and computer models. Comparisons between the experimental measurements and numerical predictions of the delayed neutron detector responses resulted in reasonable experiment/calculated ratios of 1.42 and 1.06 for the two tests. High-enriched uranium (HEU) predictions were also made with the benchmarked models. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The photon energy would be high enough to produce relatively large photofission signals, but below the photoneutron threshold for common cargo materials in order to reduce background levels. To develop such a source, we are investigating the use of low-energy, proton-induced nuclear reactions to generate monochromatic, MeV-energy gamma-rays. Of particular interest are the nuclear resonances at 163 keV for the B-11(p,gamma)(12) C reaction producing 11.7 MeV gamma-rays, 340 keV for the F-19(p,alpha gamma)(16) O reaction producing 6.13 MeV photons, and 441 keV for the Li-7(p,gamma)Be-8 reaction producing 14.8 and 17.7 MeV photons. A 700 keV Van de Graaff ion accelerator was used to test several potential (p,gamma) materials and the gamma-ray yields from these targets were measured with a 5 '' x 5 '' NaI detector. A pulsed proton beam from the accelerator was used to induce prompt (neutron) and delayed (neutron and gamma-ray) photofission signals in uranium which were measured with 3 He and Nal detectors. We show that the accelerator data is in good agreement with Monte Carlo radiation transport calculations and published results. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Recently, a portable associated-particle sealed-tube neutron generator (APSTNG) has been added as an interrogation source. This paper reports results from using the NMIS with the neutron generator to perform transmission radiography. In particular, the use of associated-particle techniques allows low-dose imaging to be performed simultaneously with traditional measurements, without physical collimation, and in high background environments.

An ErD2 thin film on a substrate of Kovar was used for the measurements with a proton beam at energies of 1.9-3.0 MeV and laboratory scattering angles of 167 degrees and 151 degrees. Within the energy range used, the measured differential scattering cross section (mb/sr) showed no significant angular dependence between these two angles, and only a slight dependence on beam energy. However, the laboratory cross section to Rutherford ratios (sigma/sigma(R)) increased linearly with beam energy at both angles; as beam energy increased from 1.9 to 3.0 MeV, the cross section ratio (sigma/sigma(R)) increased from 83.4 to 185.5 at 151 degrees and from 548.5 to 1178.4 at 167 degrees. Our data agreed reasonably well with a set of literature values obtained at laboratory scattering angles of 150 degrees, 153 degrees, and 170 degrees. Finally, we have attempted to clarify confusion in the literature resulting from conversions between different angular systems as well as conversions between measured cross section values and cross section to Rutherford ratios.

Several proton spectra were measured with proton beam energies in the 1.6-2.3 MeV energy region where two resonances in Si-28(p, p)Si-28 elastic scattering occur at 1.645 and 2.087 MeV. Also the C-12(d, P)C-13 nuclear reaction was applied to calibrate the analyzing magnet. A thick carbon target was bombarded with several deuteron beam energies in the 1.4 MeV range. The nuclear reaction proton spectra were also simulated using the SIMNRA code. However, in this case, it was not necessary to choose the deuterium beam energies near a nuclear reaction energy resonance. The comparison of the analyzer magnet calibration with this procedure is in good agreement with the calibration using the Al-27(p, gamma)Si-28 method. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This property can result in additional challenges in isotope production targetry where issues of low melting point, rapid thermal cycling, inadequate cooling designs etc. can have an effect. In contrast, the advantages of multiple simultaneous target stations at several beam energies makes this device especially attractive. It allows for the possibility of economically producing specialized research isotopes in combination with large quantities of established commercial products. The operational history of the Denton LINAC facility will be presented as it relates to those particular challenges of isotope production with a high power LINAC beam. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The current irradiation technique used to produce this radioisotope suffers from several serious inherent drawbacks, of which one is the low beam current due to cooling limitation and the other is the electroplating process used to prepare the target. A liquid-metal jet impingement target cooling system developed at Soreq NRC demonstrated recently a cooling capacity of 8.4 kW/cm(2) while the pressure of the cooling liquid on the target back was less than I bar. The latter value implies that the target can be made very thin and that the copper back-plate might be removed. Hence, we propose a new target design based on the use of a thin rhodium foil directly cooled by a liquid-metal such as gallium. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper describes the ion-optics, design and development of a compact cost-effective beamline comprised of low activation and radiation resistant materials. The beamline, complete with suitable diagnostic devices, permits the extracted proton beam to be centered (X-Y steering magnet), and focused (quadrupole doublet) on target eliminating unnecessary beamspill and ensuring high production.

These are extracted from the energy and angular distributions of the two 511 keV X-rays, produced during the annihilation of a thermal positron and an electron from the sample. Positron investigations and monitoring, however are currently not used in an industrial environment due to the lack of a sufficiently intense positron sources to record distribution functions with good statistics within minutes. Most positron spectrometers have radioactive sources which produce only modest intensities (10(6) e(+)/s). An improvement by at least a factor of 100 is needed to become viable for on-line positron metrology. We propose to combine several technologies to generate a positron beam with good electron-optical properties, such as a small divergence angle and small beam diameter and a flux of 108 e+/s or more. Positrons from a 10 Ci beta source will be moderated with a stack of 12 layers of tungsten meshes. The thermalized positrons will be accelerated into a deflection focusing analyzer (DFA) which focuses the positrons into a small (1-2 mm(2)) area of a second moderator. A rare gas solid will be used to thermalize the positrons once more. The moderating area forms the small emitter source for a accelerating gun that generate a beam of mono-energetic positrons of any desired energy. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Often composition is determined by examining elemental ratios in which the knowledge of the neutron flux is unnecessary. However, the absolute value of the neutron flux is required when the generator is used for neutron activation analysis, to study radiation damage to materials, to monitor the operation of the generator, and to measure radiation exposure. We describe a method for absolute neutron output and flux measurements of low output D-T neutron generators using delayed activation of silicon. We irradiated a series of silicon oxide samples with 14.1 MeV neutrons and counted the resulting gamma rays of the Al-28 nucleus with an efficiency-calibrated detector. To minimize the photon self-absorption effects within the samples, we used a zero-thickness extrapolation technique by repeating the measurement with samples of different thicknesses. The neutron flux measured 26 cm away from the tritium target of a Thermo Electron A-325 D-T generator (Thermo Electron Corporation, Colorado Springs, CO) was 6.2 x 10(3) n/s/cm(2) +/- 5%, which is consistent with the manufacturer's specifications.

A slow positron beam coupled with a Doppler broadening spectrometer was used to measure the low and high momentum annihilation fractions, S and W respectively, as a function of positron energy E in UO2 disks implanted at the fluence of I x 10163 He cm(-2) before and after annealing. The S(E) and W(E) behaviours change with the annealing temperature in the range from 160 to 1300 degrees C indicating that the vacancy defects distribution evolves. The positron trapping rate at vacancy defects decreases with the increasing annealing temperature with two stages around 250 degrees C and 800 degrees C. We will discuss the phenomena that could explain these annealing stages in comparison with other positron annihilation spectroscopy results and with the 3 He depth profile evolution as the function of temperature measured by Nuclear Reaction Analysis.
