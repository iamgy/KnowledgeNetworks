Radioactivity levels of staple foodstuffs and dose estimates for most of the Tanzanian population	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article							NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS; PHOSPHATE FERTILIZERS; RADIONUCLIDES; INTERCEPTION; PB-210; PO-210; ROCKS	Levels of natural radioactivity in staple food products (maize and rice) from various localities of Tanzania have been studied. The average activity concentrations of K-40, Th-232 and U-238 in maize were 48.79 +/- 0.11, 4.08 +/- 0.01 and 13.23 +/- 0.10 Bq kg(-1), respectively. In rice the concentrations of K-40, Th-232 and (238)Uwere 24.67 +/- 0.03, 3.82 +/- 0.02 and 5.02 +/- 0.02 Bq kg(-1), respectively. Cs-137 was detected in only one sample collected in Zanzibar. The sample, with activity concentration of 5.57 +/- 0.01 Bq kg(-1), had been imported from Thailand. The relatively high average concentrations of the radionuclides in maize compared to rice may be attributed to the extensive use of phosphate fertilizers in maize production in Tanzania. Total annual committed effective doses due to total 232Th and 238U intakes as a result of consumption of staple foodstuffs for infants, children and adults were 0.16, 0.29 and 0.36 mSv y(-1), respectively, which are lower than the annual dose guideline for the general public.

Activity concentrations of primordial radionuclides K-40, Ra-226 and Th-232 have been measured in house building bricks fabricated from saline soil. Forty samples of the bricks were collected from the brick fabrication sites and brick baking kilns in and around the saline soil areas of the districts of Lahore and Faisalabad in the Punjab province of Pakistan. The technique of gamma-ray spectroscopy using an HPGe detector with a PC-based multi-channel analyser was applied for determination of activity concentrations in the brick samples. The activity mass concentrations of K-40, Ra-226 and Th-232 measured in the brick samples were respectively 567.7 +/- 38.3 (493-631), 28.4 +/- 3.8 (23-35), and 56.0 +/- 4.6 (46-65) Bq kg(-1). The radiological hazards of the bricks were calculated using various models given in the literature. The radium equivalent activity was less than the accepted standard criterion value of 370 Bq kg(-1) and the values of other hazard indices were also below their limit values. The radiological hazard parameters of the bricks under investigation have been compared with those from other locations of Pakistan and also from some other countries in Asia.

J	Kawata, T				Kawata, Tomio			The impact of fuel cycle options on the space requirements of a HLW repository	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						repository; HLW; fuel cycle options; FBR cycle; decay heat; minor actinides; sustainability		Because of increasing concerns regarding global warming and the longevity of oil and gas reserves, the importance of nuclear energy as a major source of sustainable energy is gaining recognition worldwide. To make nuclear energy truly sustainable, it is necessary to ensure not only the sustainability of the fuel supply but also the sustained availability of waste repositories, especially those for high-level radioactive waste (HLW). From this perspective, the effort to maximize the waste loading density in a given repository is important for easing repository capacity problems. In most cases, the loading of a repository is controlled by the decay heat of the emplaced waste. In this paper, a comparison of the decay heat characteristics of HLW is made among the various fuel cycle options. It is suggested that, for a future fast breeder reactor (FBR) cycle, the removal and burning of minor actinides (MA) would significantly reduce the heat load in waste and would allow for a reduction of repository size by half.

Since the 1950's much of this has been associated with civil nuclear power production and the nuclear weapons programme. There have been a number of unsuccessful attempts in the UK since the 1980s to deal with the waste and find suitable sites for its disposal. However, the UK Government has addressed this and in 2001 introduced the "Managing Radioactive Waste Safely" programme. The aim of this was to make decisions on the long-term radioactive waste management policy through stakeholder engagement. In 2006, it adopted a policy of geological disposal for higher activity wastes and following further consultations, is now at the stage of choosing how that policy should be implemented.

J	Kim, KJ; Shon, JS; Ryu, WS				Kim, Kil-Jeong; Shon, Jong-Sik; Ryu, Woo-Seog			A practical method for the disposal of radioactive organic waste	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						radioactive organic; wastes; uranium; treatment; evaporation; separation; TBP; dodecane		Radioactive organic wastes containing acetone, alcohol, and particularly tributyl phosphate (TBP)/dodecane contaminated with uranium are extracted from the PUREX process and the decontamination of related equipment. An evaporation method that utilizes existing DU oxidation apparatuses and ventilation systems and a typical muffle furnace installed with an aspirating system are adopted. A separation method using phosphoric acid especially for the TBP/dodecane waste is also studied and evaluated. The results show that a simple evaporation process is utilizable for wastes containing acetone or alcohol with a lower boiling point. A modified muffle furnace is more appropriate to dispose directly of organic wastes having a higher boiling point, such as TBP/dodecane, without generating a condensed waste solution. It is recommended that, when the uranium concentration of TBP/dodecane waste is much higher than stipulated levels, separation technology should be applied to remove uranium from the mixture. Each type of solvent after separation can then be considered disposable below the regulatory limit in the modified furnace discussed in this study.

The radiological effects of such a nuclear facility on the environment are important in terms of radiation safety. This study estimated the production rates of radionuclides in the soil around the accelerator facility using MCNPX. The groundwater migration of the radioisotopes was also calculated using the Concentration Model. Several spallation reactions have occurred due to leaked neutrons, leading to the release of various radionuclides into the soil. The total activity of the induced radionuclides is approximately 2.98 x 10(-4) Bq/cm(3) at the point of saturation. Ca-45 had the highest production rate with a specific activity of 1.78 x 10(-4) Bq/cm(3) over the course of one year. H-3 and Na-23 are usually considered the most important radioisotopes at nuclear facilities. However, only a small amount of tritium was produced around this facility, as the energy of most neutrons is below the threshold of the predominant reactions for producing tritium: O-16(n,X)H-3 and Si-28(n,X)H-3 (approximately 20 MeV). The dose level of drinking water from Na-22 was 1.48 x 10(-5) pCi/ml/yr, which was less than the annual intake limit in the regulations.

Copolymer swelling and gelation% were determined with respect to the irradiation dose and PVP/CA composition. The gelation% increases with increasing the irradiation dose, but decreases with increasing the CA content in the graft copolymer. The swelling% of the prepared hydrogels decreases with increasing the irradiation dose and CA content in the copolymer, as a result of an increase in the crosslink density and the hydrogen bonds, respectively. The ion exchange capacity and the uptake of uranyl ions increase with increasing the CA content in the graft copolymer. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

On the fuel and coolant interaction behavior of partially oxidized corium	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						partially oxidized corium; steam explosion; severe accident	UO2/ZRO2 MIXTURE; DEBRIS; WATER	To simulate a fuel and coolant interaction phenomenon during a postulated severe accident in a nuclear reactor, a series of experiments were performed using a partially oxidized corium, which is a mixture Of UO2, ZrO2, Zr, and stainless steel. The composition of the melt was chosen such that a separation of the oxidic liquid from the metallic liquid occurred due to the existence of a miscibility gap. A melting and solidifying experiment and two fuel and coolant interaction experiments to explore the possibility of an energetic steam explosion were performed in the TROI facility. The placement of a metal-rich layer consisting of U, Fe, and ZrO2 beneath the oxidic corium layer due to the existence of a miscibility gap was observed in the melting and solidifying experiment. An energetic steam explosion with a propagation of the dynamic pressure wave was observed in one test out of the two tests. The physical and chemical analyses were performed for the corium particles collected after the experiments. It is shown that U, Zr, and Fe formed a heterogeneous mixture and the morphology was in irregular shape with many pores at non-uniform sizes. In the case of nonenergetic interaction, where the melt temperature was lower than the energetic case, the mean particle size was bigger than that of the energetic case, and the melt-water interaction resulted in a substantial amount of hydrogen gas generation, while the amount of hydrogen gas generation was negligible in the case with an energetic steam explosion.

For predicting the velocity profile at the diffuser outlet faces, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis has been performed to simulate the internal flow in the diffuser assembly. For the validation of a CFD code, some experimental data were chosen for each flow, and various turbulence models were examined. The shear stress transport turbulence model was proven to be the most appropriate for a prediction of the impinging jets and to give better predictions for a curved pipe flow compared to the standard k-epsilon turbulence model. As a result of the investigation, detailed velocity profiles and turbulent parameters at the real diffuser outlets were obtained, which can be applied as an inlet boundary condition for the CANDU moderator analysis.

Two different effective thermal conductivity models, developed by other investigators, were implemented within the basket openings that support the fuel assemblies. The effective thermal conductivity models affect the peak cladding temperature directly by influencing the temperature difference between the hottest cladding at the cask center and the walls that surround it. It also affects it indirectly by influencing the center basket wall temperature. The fuel assembly heat generation rates that cause the peak cladding temperature to reach the allowed limit were determined for both effective thermal conductivity models. At those generation rates the basket wall temperatures in the periphery of the package were highly nonuniform. The basket wall temperatures determined in this work will be used in future studies to develop improved thermal models of fuel assemblies.

J	Poulesquen, A; Jegou, C				Poulesquen, A.; Jegou, C.			Influence of alpha radiolysis of water on UO2 matrix alteration: Chemical/transport model	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						uranium dissolution; alpha water radiolysis; transport modeling	WASTE-DISPOSAL CONDITIONS; FUEL CORROSION	A combined transport and radiolysis model is proposed in this paper to predict the oxidation/dissolution Of UO2 under alpha radiolysis of water. The UO2-water interface is divided into an arbitrary number of layers. The Chemsimul kinetic code is used for radiolysis calculations in each layer, and the modeling of transport between the layers is based on Fick's law. The calculation proceeds in an iterative way, and an alpha dose rate profile is taken into account as input data. To limit the calculation time, which depends on the computer capacity and the duration of the leaching experiment described, a compromise between the thickness and the number of cells has to be found. At present, simulations of leaching experiments lasting several days cannot be carried out because of the very long calculation time. However, the calculation has been compared with experimental results obtained under irradiation at high flux levels of a UO2-water interface subjected to a beam of He2+ particles generated by a cyclotron. Owing to computer time limitation, calculations are carried out by considering 200 layers, each 10 mu m thick, to simulate 1-h experiments. In the experimental geometry (monoenergetic linear alpha beam), the alpha dose rate profile is well described by a summation of Bragg curves. The comparison relates to experiments performed in aerated and deaerated media at a high flux of 3.3 X 10(10) alpha center dot cm(-2)center dot s(-1) and 3.3 X10(10) alpha center dot cm(-2) center dot s(-1). The calculated uranium content in solution is three times lower than the experimental value, and the hydrogen peroxide concentration is ten times lower in aerated media. In deaerated media, however, the comparison is quite good. Finally, a calculation was carried out with a large imposed dissolved hydrogen concentration in solution to check the inhibition of matrix dissolution. The release of uranium in solution is relatively high despite the hydrogen concentration in solution because of the primary formation of hydrogen peroxide. This is probably because of a lack of knowledge concerning the inhibitor mechanism under alpha radiolysis (influence of the surface under alpha irradiation, hydrogen activation, validity of primary radiolytic yield in presence of H-2, etc.), which is not taken into account in our calculations.

A strongly magnetic Brimac 216 fine powder produced by Lidzey has been shown to be an excellent adsorbent for many radionuclides. After the adsorption of the radionuclides has taken place,from solution onto the magnetic Brimac 216 powder, the powder, together with the adsorbed radionuclides, can be rapidly removed from suspension, as a concentrate, using high gradient magnetic separation (HGMS). A comparison is drawn between experimental results using the conventional column filter, with bone char as the adsorbent medium, and calculations for the HGMS process to treat 3.22 m(3) of solution containing 8 mg center dot l(-1) of (238) Pu and to remove the Pu-238, from the suspension to reduce the effluent to less than the maximum concentration limit (MCL) for Pu-238 which is 0.74 Bq center dot l(-1); however, the minimum concentration value used here is less than the MCL and is 0.0444 Bq center dot l(-1) (7.006 x 10(-14) g center dot l(-1) of Pu-238) and is denoted as the lower concentration level. Calculations indicate that HGMS is considerably faster than the column filtration method. This leads to a significant reduction in the time required to process the solution, even though the HGMS process is repeated a number of times. Also, the mass of adsorbent requiring long-term storage is much smaller for HGMS than for the column filtration method.

Physical property modeling of concentrated cesium eluate solutions - Part I: Derivation of models	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						physical property modeling; cesium ion-exchange eluate; evaporation		Both experimental and process simulation studies were performed to develop physical property models of the concentrated cesium ion-exchange eluate solutions in one of the Hanford Waste Treatment Plant evaporators. The physical properties of interest included the bulk solubility, density, viscosity, and heat capacity of the evaporator bottoms, and the proposed model of each response was a linear mixture model containing 12 coefficients. A unique feature of this work is that the values of these coefficients were determined by the regression of the "virtual" experimental data, which were not measured but were calculated using a computer process model that simulated the semibatch evaporation of cesium eluate solutions. To improve the accuracy of calculated virtual experimental data and the resulting physical property models, a series of benchscale evaporation tests was also conducted to provide the necessary experimental data for the development of a multielectrolyte thermodynamic database on which the computer process model was built. Specifically, the solubility and other physical properties of selected binary, ternary, and higher-order systems were measured to support the optimization of a sexenary database for the Na-K-Cs-Al-HNO3-H2O system. As the input to the virtual experimental runs, a matrix of cesium eluate simulants was designed within the bounding concentrations of the major analytes identified in radioactive samples. The computer process model was then run in conjunction with the sexenary thermodynamic database to calculate the physical properties of each matrix solution concentrated to the target end points of 80 and 100% saturation. The calculated physical properties were analyzed statistically and fitted into the 12-coefficient mixture function of temperature and the concentrations of major analytes in the unevaporated eluate. Over the concentration and temperature ranges considered, the resulting empirical physical property models were found to correlate the computer-generated data well without significant bias.

Measurement of ultra-low potassium contaminations with Accelerator Mass Spectrometry	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Mass Spectrometers; radioactivity; charged-particle beams	DARK-MATTER SEARCH; CRYSTAL SCINTILLATORS; NEUTRINO; ENERGY; DETECTOR; ELEMENTS; K-40; AMS	Levels of trace radiopurity in active detector materials is a subject of major concern in low-background experiments. Among the radioisotopes, K-40 is one of the most abundant and yet whose signatures are difficult to reject. Procedures were devised to measure trace potassium concentrations in the inorganic salt CsI as well as in organic liquid scintillator (LS) with Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS), giving, respectively, the K-40-contamination levels of similar to 10(-10) and similar to 10(-13) g/g. Measurement flexibilities and sensitivities are improved over conventional methods. The projected limiting sensitivities if no excess of potassium signals had been observed over background are 5 x 10(-14) and 3 x 10(-17) g/g for the CsI and LS, respectively. Studies of the LS samples indicate that the radioactive contaminations come mainly in the dye solutes, while the base solvents are orders of magnitude cleaner. This work demonstrates the possibilities of measuring naturally occurring isotopes with the AMS techniques. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

B.			The nylon scintillator containment vessels for the Borexino solar neutrino experiment	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Borexino; solar neutrinos; nylon; organic scintillator; low-background	DETECTOR; TIME; NITROGEN; ENERGY	Borexino is a solar neutrino experiment designed to observe the 0.86 MeV Be-7 neutrinos emitted in the pp cycle of the sun. Neutrinos will be detected by their elastic scattering on electrons in 100 ton of liquid scintillator. The neutrino event rate in the scintillator is expected to be low (similar to 0.35 events per day per ton), and the signals will be at energies below 1.5 MeV, where background from natural radioactivity is prominent. Scintillation light produced by the recoil electrons is observed by an array of 2240 photomultiplier tubes. Because of the intrinsic radioactive contaminants in these PMTs, the liquid scintillator is shielded from them by a thick barrier of buffer fluid. A spherical vessel made of thin nylon film contains the scintillator, separating it from the surrounding buffer. The buffer region itself is divided into two concentric shells by a second nylon vessel in order to prevent inward diffusion of radon atoms. The radioactive background requirements for Borexino are challenging to meet, especially for the scintillator and these nylon vessels. Besides meeting requirements for low radioactivity, the nylon vessels must also satisfy requirements for mechanical, optical, and chemical properties. The present paper describes the research and development, construction, and installation of the nylon vessels for the Borexino experiment. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, numerous questions remain still unresolved and it appears today of prime importance to access to a detailed and accurate description of the complete track structure of the most used radio-isotopes in order to determine the damages potentially induced during medical exams in the investigated organs. In this work, we present a detailed inter comparison of the main isotopes used in nuclear medicine namely F-18, C-11, N-13, O-15, Ga-68, Rb-82, (CU)-C-62, Fe-52 and (SC)-S-44. To do that, we use a home-made Monte Carlo code developed for positron tracking in water [C. Champion, C. Le Loirec, Phys. Med. Biol. 51 (2006) 1707] and recently adapted for simulating the complete decay of beta(+) radioisotopes in the biological matter, this latter being commonly modelled by liquid water. We also access, for each isotope, to quantitative data such as spatial and energetic (dosimetric) profiles. The results are in a major part given in an analytical way in order to be easily usable and then extrapolated to more complex situations.

Experiments on radioactive samples with activities up to 106 times the limit of exemption at X-ray energies from around 2.1 keV (P K-edge) to 25 keV (Pd K-edge) are possible. Three recent instrumental developments at the Nuclear Waste Disposal (INE)-Beamline are presented: a Quick-XAFS mode of operating the Lemonnier-type monochromator in fixed exit for timeresolved experiments, total electron yield detection, and the use of one-dimensional compound refractive lenses, fabricated at the Institut fur Mikrostrukturtechnik (IMT) at Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (FZK), as a virtual slit for surface sensitive X-ray studies. Future upgrades for lowering the attainable energy, installing a microfocus option, and commissioning a cryostat for radioactive samples are planned. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Neutronic calculations were performed using a (DT) fusion driver hybrid reactor under a neutron wall loud of 2.25 MW/m(2) by full reactor power for one year. Obtained results were compared with three different data libraries (ENDF/B-V, ENDF/B-VI and CLAW-IV). TBR values in the reactor blanket for all investigated materials became greater than the minimum requirement (TBR > 1.05). Nuclear parameters like DPA, He-production and nuclear heating were considered as radiation damage limits for structural materials, copper alloy (Cu0.5Cr0.3Zr) showed better performance than all investigated materials.

In this paper, finite element analyses and verifying tests for a shock-absorbing effect of a pad in a spent fuel dry storage cask were carried out to improve the structural integrity of the canister under a hypothetical accidental drop condition. The pad of the storage cask was originally designed as cylindrical steel structure filled with concrete. The pad was modified by using the structure composed of steel and polyurethane-foam instead of the quarter of the upper concrete as an impact limiter. The effects of the shape and the thickness of the steel structure and the density of the polyurethane-foam which was used in between steel structures were studied. As the optimized pad of a spent fuel dry storage cask, the quarter of the upper concrete was replaced with 12 mm thick circular steel structure and polyurethanefoam whose density was 85 kg/m(3). The drop tests of a 1/3 scale model for the canister on to the original pad and the optimized pad were conducted. The effect of the pad structure was evaluated from the drop tests. The optimized pad has a greater shock-absorbing effect than the original pad. In order to verify the analysis results, strains and accelerations in the time domain by the analytical methods were compared with those by a test. The numerical method of simulating the free drop test for a dry storage cask was verified and the numerical results were found to be reliable. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Design and analysis of HYPER	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								KAERI (Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute) has been developing an accelerator driven transmutation system called HYPER (hybrid power extraction reactor). It is designed to transmute long-lived TRU and fission products such as Tc-99 and 1-129. HYPER is a 1000 MWth system with k(eff) = 0.98 which requires 17 mA proton beam for an operation at EOC (end of cycle). Pb-Bi is used as the coolant and target material at the same time. HYPER core has 186 ductless hexagonal fuel assemblies. The fuel blanket is divided into three TRU (transuranic elements) enrichment zones to flatten the radial power distribution. The core height of HYPER was compromised at 150 cm, and the power density was determined such that the average coolant speed could be about 1.64 m/s. The inlet and exit coolant temperatures are 340 and 490 degrees C, respectively, in the core. The cylindrical beam tube and spherical window is adopted as the basic window design of HYPER. We have also introduced an Lead-Bismuth eutectic injection tube to maximize the allowable proton beam current. A metallic alloy of U-TRU-Zr is considered as the HYPER fuel, in which pure lead is used as the bonding material. As a result, a large gas plenum is placed above the active core. TRU transmutation rate is 282 kg/yr. In the case of a FP transmutation, 28.0 kg of Tc-99 and 7.0 kg of I-129 are incinerated per year. The MACSIS-H (metal fuel performance analysis code for simulating the in-reactor behavior under steady-state conditions-HYPER) for an metallic fuel was developed as the steady-state performance computer code. The MATRA (multichannel analyzer for transient and steady-state in rod array) code was used to perform the thermal-hydraulic analysis of HYPER core. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Compton suppression through rise-time analysis	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						compton suppression; pulse shape discrimination technique; timing measurement	PULSE-SHAPE ANALYSIS; CONTINUUM SUPPRESSION; SCATTERING	We studied Compton suppression for Co-60 and Cs-137 radioisotopes using a signal selection criterion based on contrasting the fall time of the signals composing the photo peak with those composing the Compton continuum. The fall time criterion is employed by using the pulse shape analysis observing the change in the fall times of the gamma-ray pulses. This change is determined by measuring the changes in the rise times related to the fall time of the scintillator and the timing signals related to the fall time of the input signals. We showed that Compton continuum suppression is achieved best via the precise timing adjustment of an analog rise-time analyzer connected to a NaI(Tl) scintillation spectrometer.

J	Yucel, H				Yucel, Haluk			The applicability of MGA method for depleted and natural uranium isotopic analysis in the presence of actinides (Th-232, Np-237, Pa-233 and Am-241)	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						uranium; isotopic abundance; gamma-ray spectrometry; multi-group analysis (MGA); actinide; planar Ge	GAMMA-RAY SPECTROMETRY; ENRICHMENT; CODE	The multi-group analysis (MGA) method for the determination of uranium isotopic abundances in depleted uranium (DU) and natural uranium (NU) samples is applied in this study. A set of non-destructive gamma-ray measurements of DU and NU samples were performed using a planar Ge detector. The relative abundances of U-235 and U-238 isotopes were compared with the declared values of the standards. The relative abundance for U-235 obtained by MGA for a "clean" DU or NU sample with a content of uranium > 1 wt% is determined with an accuracy of about +/- 5%. However, when several actinides such as Th-232, Np-237, Pa-233 and Am-241 are present along with uranium isotopes simulating "dirty" DU or NU, it has been observed that MGA method gives erroneous results. The U-235 abundance results for the samples were 6-25 times higher than the declared values in the presence of above-mentioned actinides, since MGA is utilized the X-ray and gamma-ray peaks in the 80-130keV energy region, covering XK alpha and XK beta regions. After the least-squares fitting of the spectra, it is found that the increases in the intensities of the X-ray and gamma-ray peaks of uranium are remarkably larger in the complex 80-130 keV region. On the other hand, it is observed that the interferences of the actinide peaks are relatively less dominant in the higher gamma-ray region of 130-300 keV. The results imply the need for dirty DU and NU samples that the NIGA method should utilize the higher energy gamma-rays (up to 1001 keV of Pa-234m) combined with lower energies of the spectra, which may be collected in a two detector mode (a planar Ge and a high efficient coaxial Ge).

To our knowledge, there seems to be no information about radioactivity level in the Firtina Valley soils and sediments so far. For this reason, soil and sediment samples were collected along the Firtina Valley and analysis on the collected samples were carried out to determine U-238, Th-232, K-40 and Cs-137 radioisotopes using high purity germanium detector. The activity concentrations obtained for Ra-226, Ph-214, Bi-214, Ac-228, Tl-208, K-40 and Cs-137 are given in the unit of Bq/kg. The results have been compared with other radioactivity measurements in different country's soils and sediments. The radium equivalent activity (Ra-eq), the absorbed dose rate (D), the external hazard index (H-ex), the annual gonadal dose equivalent (AGDE) and the annual effective dose equivalent (AEDE) were also calculated and compared with the international recommended values.

Assessment of the effectiveness of mixed uranium-plutonium fuel in VVER	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								An assessment of the cost-effectiveness of burning mixed uranium-plutonium fuel in VVER reactors is made as a function of the price of natural uranium. It is shown that for the present price structure, based on the main technological processes used for fabricating fuel, mixed fuel becomes cost-effective when the price of natural uranium is about $300/kg. The results of systems investigations of the development of nuclear power in our country with an orientation toward fast reactors are also presented. In this case, the systems price of plutonium at the stage where fast reactors are first introduced increases. This indicates that the growth prospects must be taken into account in order to develop an efficient fuel-use strategy.	[Ponomarev-Stepnoi, N. N.; Tsibul'skii, V.

Recent activities and trends in the uranium market	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article								Concerns about the impact of hydrocarbon use on climate and global warming are significantly growing. Furthermore, we are all well aware that security of supply is increasingly an issue. In this context, it is now principally recognised that nuclear energy has to be back on the agenda. All in all, the prospects for the nuclear power industry and thus for the uranium activities is very positive for the coming years. The changes that have taken place in the international uranium market during the past several years are remarkable. Since 2002, the uranium prices have increased more than tenfold. The spot market price of uranium began an increase from about USD 9/lb U3O8 in mid 2001 following a fire at the Olympic Dam mill (Australia) in October 2001 and was propelled in subsequent years by a series of interrupting events, such as the mine shaft flooding at the McArthur River mine (Canada) in April 2003, the threat of the early shutdown of the Rossing mine (Namibia) and the Ranger mine (Australia) in 2003, the decision of Techsnabexport (Tenex, Russia) in October 2003 to terminate sales of UF6 to the US trading company Globe Nuclear Services and Supply GNSS Ltd. (GNSS), and finally the complete flooding at the developing Cigar Lake mine (Canada) in October 2006. With the emergence of hedge funds and investors, that began in late 2004, increased uranium demand and upward pressure on market prices were further stimulated. What about the recent events and trends in the uranium industry? Are the uranium producers and the utilities well prepared to meet all the challenges associated with developments in the uranium business? And what about the risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect the developments in the uranium industry and uranium markets?.

J	Kuczera, B				Kuczera, B.			Notes on the origins, occurrence, and potential uses as a primary energy resource of uranium	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								The question of the origins of uranium with its 2 radioisotopes, U-235 and U-238, leads back to the origins of chemical elements in general, which must be discussed in connection with the development of the Universe. A rough classification into 3 phases may be helpful in this attempt. - In the early phase of the Universe, the generation of protons and neutrons was followed mainly by the production of helium nuclei, i.e. light elements. Astrophysicists refer to this nuclear fusion also as primordial nucleosynthesis. - Medium-heavy elements up to the range of iron (Fe) were generated in nuclear fusion processes in the stars. - The heavy elements above iron were created in neutron capture processes occurring in stars rich in mass, and in supernova explosions. These processes are sketched with a view to the generation of uranium within the standard model of cosmology. In addition, occurrences of uranium on Earth and uranium deposits as potential long-term sources of nuclear fuel are described in a summary overview. Approx. 4.7 million tons of recoverable natural uranium reserves and another 10 million tons of prognosticated reserves constitute sufficient long-range uranium resources.

Experience in implementing projects in eastern Europe	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								The article covers the present projects and activities in Eastern Europe of Nukem Technologies GmbH. The company's East European business began in 1973 in the field of uranium trading. After difficult negotiations in the period of the "cold war" it became possible to enter into an agreement with the Soviet foreign trade organization, Techsnabexport, about purchases of uranium for Western nuclear power plants. In the course of Nukem's realignment in the late 1980s, the focus was shifted more and more to the possibility of exporting into other countries the technologies developed and proven in Germany. This included countries in Eastern Europe. The situation changed abruptly with the political opening of Eastern Europe. A large potential market opened to Nukem as a supplier of technologies and plants for waste treatment and, later, the wider area of decommissioning. The partners in Eastern Europe were interested in proven, modem solutions. The ensuing success was also due to the fact that Nukem, in the early nineties, hired specialists from the new German federal states who had studied in the Soviet Union and were familiar with Russian technology, language, and culture. Soliciting analogous projects in the countries of Eastern Europe other than the former Soviet Union was begun in a parallel process. Very soon it turned out that also the interim storage of spent fuel elements constituted a potential market.

Radioactive waste arisings in Germany - Waste statistics of 2004 and forecasts of future waste arisings by 2080	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								Radioactive residues arise in radioactive materials handling requiring notification or permits, and in the application of radioactive isotopes. Under Sec.9a, para.1, Atomic Energy Act, they must be disposed of as waste in a managed process unless they are safely re-used. Various proven techniques and plants are available for conditioning raw waste. Waste conditioning is performed to produce waste packages suitable for interim storage and/or final storage. Most conditioners currently apply the final storage conditions of the Konrad repository. Since 1984, the German Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS) every year has determined the inventories of untreated radio-active residues and intermediate products as well as the inventories, volumes in interim storage, and arisings expected for the following year of conditioned radioactive waste. The article contains an overview of the radioactive waste existing in the Federal Republic of Germany by December 31, 2004. On the basis of information supplied by the parties required to deliver/dispose of waste, a forecast is made of the conditioned radioactive waste generating negligible amounts of heat expected to arise by 2080. The inquiry conducted for statistical information about radioactive residues for 2004 was based on evaluations of the data supplied by 57 parties required to deliver/dispose of waste.

Three-dimensional nuclear assessment for the chamber of Z-Pinch power plant	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								Detailed three-dimensional nuclear analyses have been carried out for the chamber of a power plant concept that utilizes the Z-Pinch driven inertial confinement technology with a target yield of 3 GJ and repetition rate of 0.1 Hz per chamber. The elliptical chamber concept was modeled with the double-layered Recyclable Transmission Lines (RTL). Thick liquid jets are utilized to breed tritium, absorb energy, and shield the chamber wall. Two liquid breeder options were considered; the molten salt Flibe and the LiPb eutectic (Li17Pb83). The chamber wall is made of the low activation ferritic steel alloy F82H. While both breeders have the potential for achieving tritium self-sufficiency, the thermal power is similar to 65% higher with LiPb. However, a 55% thicker jet zone is required with LiPb to provide adequate chamber wall shielding. A thicker chamber wall is required with LiPb to reduce the nuclear energy leakage below 1%. The chamber wall does not need replacement except for the top part around the jet nozzles. Helium production in the chamber wall protected by LiPb is much lower than that with Flibe. Rewelding is possible only in the lower part of chamber wall below the pool.

Neutronics analysis of a self-cooled blanket for a laser fusion plant with magnetic diversion	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							PARAMETERS; REACTORS; IMPACT	A blanket concept made of the low electrical conductivity SiCf/SiC composite and utilizing Li17Pb83 as coolant and tritium breeder has been developed and integrated with the magnetic diversion system. Neutronics issues related to tritium breeding adequacy particularly with the area lost to the dump plates at the ring and point cusps were addressed. Radiation damage and lifetime considerations for the SiCf/SiC structural material were also addressed. Another issue of concern is providing adequate shielding for the superconducting cusp magnets. Detailed neutronics analyses show that tritium self-sufficiency can be achieved. A 0.5 in thick water-cooled steel shield that doubles as the vacuum vessel is a reweldable lifetime component and will provide adequate shielding for the magnets.

Measurement of flux spectra and tritium production rates in an iter TBM mock-up irradiated with 14 MeV neutrons	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								A mock-up of the European Helium-Cooled Pebble Bed TBM was irradiated with DT neutrons in pulsed and continuous mode at the Fusion Neutronics Laboratory of the University of Technology Dresden. The aim was to measure fast neutron and gamma-ray flux spectra as well as time-of-arrival spectra of the slow neutron flux. The results of the experiments were analysed by the Monte Carlo code MCNP and nuclear data from the European Fusion File (EFF-3), and the Fusion Evaluated Nuclear Data Library (FENDL-2.0/2. 1). It was found that the calculation of the fast neutron flux above 3 MeV tends to overestimate while the gammaray flux and slow neutron flux in two measurement positions in the mock-up was underestimated. The mock-up was also irradiated at FNG/ENEA Frascati to measure tritium breeding rates by means of small Li2CO3 pellet detectors inserted into the breeding layers. The breeding experiment was analysed at FZ Karlsruhe with emphasis on determining sensitivities of the TPR to relevant cross section uncertainties of all materials in the mock-up. It was found that the TPR calculation shows a tendency to underestimate. From the sensitivity analysis it was found that the total TPR is most sensitive to the elastic scattering in Be and the Li-7(n,alpha T) reaction.

Slab mockup assemblies based on the water-cooled pebble bed ITER TBM including water panels and/or a breeder pebble layer were irradiated by 14 Me V neutrons. After the irradiation, the amount of tritium produced in the diagnostic Li2CO3 pellets or breeder pebbles is measured by liquid scintillation counting method. The C/E ratios for the tritium production rate in those experiments are within 1 +/- 0.05. A plan of the neutronics test on ITER-TBM and the neutronic diagnostics in the module are discussed. Micro fission chambers and compact activation foil transfer systems to be embedded in TBM are proposed for the neutron flux and neutron spectrum measurements, respectively.

A SiC/SiC composite flow channel insert is proposed to reduce the steel dissolution rate (and the magnetohydrodynamic pressure drop). Prior capsule testing examined dense, high-purity SiC in Pb-Li at 800 degrees-1200 degrees C and found detectable levels of Si in the Pb-Li after 2,000h at 1100 degrees C and 1,000h at 1200 degrees C Current capsule experiments are examining several different SiC/SiC composite materials at 1000 degrees C. Another issue involves Pb-Li transport between the first wall and heat exchanger Aluminide coatings on type 316 stainless steel and Al-containing alloys capable of forming an external alumina scale have been studied in capsule experiments at 700 degrees and 800 degrees C for 1,000h. Model aluminide coatings made by chemical vapor deposition reduced the dissolution rate for 316SS at 800 degrees C by a factor of 50.

It uses He as a coolant at an inlet temperature of 300 degrees C and an outlet temperature up to 406 degrees C and Li is used as a tritium breeder by considering its potential advantages. Two layers of graphite are inserted as a reflector in the breeder zone to increase the Tritium Breeding Ratio (TBR) and the shielding performances. A 3-D Monte Carlo analysis is performed with the MCCARD code for the neutronics and the total TBM power is designed to be 0.675 MW at a normal heat flux from the plasma side. From the analysis results with CFX-10 for the thermal-hydraulics, the He cooling path is determined and it shows that the maximum temperature of the first wall does not exceed 550 degrees C at the structural materials and the coolant velocities are 50 m/sec and 25 similar to 32 m/sec at the first wall and breeding zone, respectively. The obtained temperature data is used in the thermal-mechanical analysis with ANSYS-10. The maximum von Mises equivalent stress of the first wall is 2540 MPa and the maximum deformation of it is 1. 3 mm.

The coating thickness decreases with increased deposition temperature and increases with increased deposition time. The atomic ratio of Si and C nears 1:1 in coating, while oxygen fraction exists. The coating shows a trend that the crystallization starts from deposition temperature of 723K, though the coating is amorphous. In this study, the deuterium permeation flux of bare JLF-1 is lower about two orders of magnitude than that of Eurofer97, which is thought as a reason of oxidation of bare JLF-1 during test. The deuterium permeation flux of coated JLF-1 is about one to two orders of magnitude lower than that of bare JLF-1.

This suggests consideration of a new inertial confinement fusion power plant concept, which has a small fusion pulse and a high repetition laser with a dry wall chamber. To establish the potential of the fast ignition method and to make clear the critical issues, a Fast Ignition ICF reactor concept with a Dry Wall chamber and a High Repetition Laser (FI-DWHRL concept) was previously proposed. The maintenance approach for this Fast Ignition ICF reactor concept is preliminary considered and its critical issues are described in this paper. The large cask and the large maintenance port for replacing the blanket sectors are applied to this Fast Ignition ICF reactor concept. The first wall and blanket system is divided into 20 sectors and all beam lines go between blanket sectors. The vacuum vessel is located outside the blanket system and this vacuum vessel also serves as the tritium boundary. To replace the final optical device, 6 access corridors are placed along the reactor room. Finally, critical issues on this maintenance approach are listed.

The WCSB and HCSB modules consist of reduced activation ferritic/martensitic steel, F82H, as the structural material, Li2TiO3 as the tritium breeder material, beryllium or Be-Ti alloy as the neutron multiplier. One of the R&Ds for the WCSB TBM, the mockup of the first wall with embedded cooling channels was fabricated by applying HIP technique. Pebbles of Be12Ti, which is a candidate material for the advanced neutron multiplier, were produced by a small-scale rotating electrode method. Mechanical and chemical properties and irradiation effects have been studied for Be12T pebbles. Both oxidation and steam interaction were about 1/1000 as small as those of beryllium metal, which indicates a possibility to reduce a risk of a water or air ingress accident. The test schedule of TBMs is discussed according to the ITER operation phases.

From this viewpoint, the permeation of hydrogen through a Nb membrane was investigated with an ultra-high vacuum apparatus under the conditions relevant to the blanket system where no oxide films could be retained on the membrane surfaces. It was, however, found that the permeation rate sharply decreased with increasing oxygen concentration in the bulk of membrane; at upstream H-2 pressure of 1 Pa and membrane temperature of 700 degrees C, for example, the permeation rate at oxygen concentration corresponding to oxygen potential in Pb-17Li (0. 054 at%) was evaluated to be 115 of the value expected from hydrogen solubility and diffusivity in Nb. Such small permeation rate was ascribed to the presence of oxygen monolayer formed by surface segregation from the bulk. Surface modification by Pd coating was found to give only limited improvement due to degradation in coating effect induced by interdiffusion between Pd and Nb. Methods to improve the high temperature stability of Pd coating was discussed.

J	Kotoh, K; Kudo, K				Kotoh, Kenji; Kudo, Kazuhiko			Diffusion characteristics of hydrogen-isotopic water molecules in zeolite crystals	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							TRITIATED MOISTURE; GAS-STREAM; COLLECTION	Although the method of adsorption using synthetic zeolites has been applied to the systems of removal or/and recovery of tritiated water vapor from tritium handling atmospheres or process gases, the dynamic behavior of hydrogen-isotopic water molecules in zeolites is not et sufficiently elucidated because the interaction between strongly polarized water molecules and zeolite crystalline surfaces is complicated. Considering the basic definition of mass transfer with the chemical potential gradient as driving force for diffusion, we obtained an expression of diffusivity depending on temperature and concentration, derived from the characteristics of adsorption equilibrium as a function of adsorption potential, where the diffusivity is described in relation to the mobility corrected here by deriving a term of activation energy. Experimental diffusion coefficients for tracer HTO in H2O adsorbed in zeolite crystals, measured under various conditions of temperature and vapor pressure, indicate a variety of values. The variety, however, can be clearly interpreted in accordance with this expression.

These experimental results showed that there were four deuterium trapping states; two of which were interacted with and without oxygen near the surface, and the other two were interacted with E'-center and with oxygen with the formation of O-D bond in the bulk. These trapping states of deuterium in the bulk were almost the same as those of tritium generated in thermal neutron-irradiated Li2TiO3. The total amount of deuterium retention in the bulk was almost constant until O-D bonds formed in the bulk were decomposed, indicating that tritium trapping could proceed under hot atom chemical reactions. It was concluded that E'-center could trap the implanted deuterium more frequently than oxygen with the formation of O-D bonds in the bulk. Annihilations of them due to oxygen recovery could increase the retention of D with the formation of O-D bonds, resulting in the almost constant deuterium retention ratio up to its decomposition temperature of 573 K.

Effects of tritium on UHMW-PE, PTFE, and vespel (R) polyimide	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							RADIATION	Samples of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and the polyimide Vespel (R) were exposed to tritium gas in closed containers initially at 101 kPa (1 atmosphere) pressure and ambient temperature for various times up to 2.3 years. Tritium exposure effects on the samples were characterized by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and radiolysis products were characterized by measuring the total final pressure and composition in the exposure containers at the end of exposure period.

Tritium release behavior from steels irradiated by high energy protons	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								Thermal desorption behavior of tritium has been investigated for SS316 and F82H irradiated by 580MeV proton (SINQ-target3) up to 5.0 similar to 5.9 dpa and 63 similar to 9.1 dpa, respectively, in order to understand tritium transport in the irradiated materials. While the tritium release has only one peak at 670 K from irradiated SS316, that has two peaks at 510 K and 670 K from irradiated F82H. Those results indicate that only one kind of trap site exists in the SS316, and at least two kinds of trap site exist in F82H. As the results of tritium transport analysis of tritium release behavior, it was found that the trap site at 670 K for SS316 and F82H could be controlled by the same trap mechanism. As to the chemical form of tritium released from the steels, 112 and 113 of tritium was release as water vapor form from SS316 and F82H, respectively. It could be attributed to the growth of surface oxide on the metal surfaces during the TDS.

J	Song, P; Holder, J; Young, B; Kalantar, D; Eder, D; Kimbrough, J				Song, Peter; Holder, Joe; Young, Bruce; Kalantar, Dan; Eder, David; Kimbrough, Joe			Neutron radiation shielding for the nif streaked x-ray detector (sxd) diagnostic	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								The National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) is preparing for the National Ignition Campaign (NIC) scheduled in 2010. The NIC is comprised of several "tuning" physics sub-campaigns leading up to a demonstration of Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) ignition. Some of these experiments requires to use the NIF streak x-ray detector (SXD) to measure fuel capsule trajectory (shock timing) or x-ray "bang-time" from time-resolved x-ray imaging of the imploding capsule fuelled with pure tritium (T) instead of a deuterium-tritium (DT) mixture. The resulting prompt neutron fluence at the planned SXD location (similar to 1.7 m from the target) would be similar to 1.4e9/cm(2). Previous measurements suggest the onset of significant background at a neutron fluence of similar to 1e8/cm(2) and the radiation damage and operational upsets which start at similar to 1e8 rad-Si/sec must be factored into an integrated experimental campaign plan. Monte Carlo analyses were performed to predict the neutron and gamma/x-ray fluences and radiation doses for the proposed diagnostic configuration. A possible shielding configuration is proposed to mitigate radiation effects. The primary component of this shielding is an 80 cm thickness of Polyethylene (PE) between target chamber center (TCC) and the SXD diagnostic. Additionally, 6-8 cm of PE around the detector reduces the large number of neutrons that scatter off the inside of the target chamber. This proposed shielding configuration reduces the high-energy neutron fluence at the SXD by approximately a factor of similar to 50.

J	Hirooka, Y				Hirooka, Yoshi			Particle balance analysis in steady state DT-fusion reactors with helium ash removal by wall pumping	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							DEVICES; COMPONENTS; RETENTION; NICKEL	For the successful steady state operation of deuterium-tritium (DT) fusion reactors, helium (He) ash needs to be removed continuously from the burning core, along with unburned hydrogenic fuel particles, to sustain the power generation. This will require enormous particle pumping capabilities despite the fact that helium is the most difficult gas to be pumped by means of cryogenic condensation. In the present work, zero-dimensional, four-reservoir (core-plasma, SOL-plasma, gas-phase, and wall material) global particle balance modeling has been conducted for both DT-fuel and He-ash particles. Modeling results indicate that, for the density control of He-ash particles in the burning core, passive wall pumping via codeposition with eroded plasma-facing materials would definitely be necessary to compensate for the lack of pumping speed provided by conventional vacuum equipment. Recent experimental data on helium codeposition with lithium have been used as input for modeling and results indicate that lithium-gettered moving-surface plasma-facing components can meet the He-ash pumping requirements.
