Overview of the last progresses blanket modules for the European test projects	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-24)	SEP 11-15, 2006	Warsaw, POLAND			ITER; HCLL; HCPB; test blanket modules	BREEDING BLANKETS; ITER; DESIGN; TECHNOLOGIES	This paper gives an overview of the last progresses in terms of system design, calculations, safety and R&D done these last 2 years for the reference Test Blanket Modules developed in Europe, namely the Helium Cooled Lithium-Lead (HCLL) breeder blanket and the Helium Cooled Pebble Bed (HCPB), in order to cope with the ambitious objective to introduce two EU TBM systems for day-1 of ITER operation. The engineering design of the two systems is mostly concluded and the priority is now on the development and qualification of the fabrication technologies. From calculations point of view, the last modelling efforts related to the thermal-hydraulic of the first wall, the tritium behaviour, and the box thermal and mechanical resistance in accidental conditions are presented. Last features of the TBM and cooling system designs and integration in ITER reactor are highlighted. In particular, this paper also describes the safety and licensing analyses performed for each concept to be able to include the TBM systems in the ITER preliminary safety report (RPrS). Finally, overview of recent R&D progresses in fabrication, tritium experiments and test facilities development is given. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Design of the ITER torus prototype cryopump	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-24)	SEP 11-15, 2006	Warsaw, POLAND			ITER; torus cryopump; cryosorption; vacuum	FEAT	Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (FZK) is developing the ITER prototype torus exhaust pumping system, comprising eight identical cryosorption pumps to provide a high pumping speed and capacity, and fast regeneration. The prototype pump features an integral inlet valve with a nominal diameter of 800 mm which can be closed during the plasma pulse operation for on-line regeneration. The pump design is incorporating the results of the experimental campaigns performed with the model torus cryopump in the TIMO test bed at FZK as well as the results achieved in the large scale tritium testing of an ITER relevant cryosorption pump set-up at JET. This paper summarizes the requirements for the pumping system and outlines how these are successfully met. The way in which the nominal parameters for the detailed design of the cryopumps are derived from the overall system specification is described. Finally, the detailed design of the pump and its sub-assemblies will be presented. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Hydrogen permeation through membranes with cracks in protection layer	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-24)	SEP 11-15, 2006	Warsaw, POLAND			tritium permeation barrier; permeation reduction factor	BARRIER DEVELOPMENT; TRITIUM; MANET	Three-dimensional calculations of permeation through membranes with a cracked protection layer have been performed. Analytical solution for the one-dimensional permeation problem has been considered for the case where the absorption influx is determined by the surface opened by the cracks. Good agreement between the two solutions has been found. Cracking of the protection barrier leads to smaller degradation of its properties if permeation through the bare membrane takes place in the surface limited regime. Even small cracking (0.001% of surface is open) can reduce the permeation reduction factor down to 10 if permeation through the bare membrane takes place in pure diffusion limited regime. Only severe cracking (10% of surface is open) can lead to the same reduction if permeation through the bare membrane takes place in pure surface limited regime. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Commissioning of water detritiation and cryogenic distillation systems at TLK in view of ITER design	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-24)	SEP 11-15, 2006	Warsaw, POLAND			tritium; water detritiation; hydrogen isotope separation; cryogenic distillation	PERFORMANCES; EXCHANGE	The ITER Isotope Separation System (ISS) and Water Detritiation System (WDS) will be integrated in order to reduce potential chronic tritium releases from the ISS by routing the top (protium) product from the ISS into the Liquid Phase Catalytic Exchange (LPCE) column of WDS. This provides an additional barrier against ISS tritium releases and should mitigate the memory effects due to process parameter fluctuations in the ISS. To support the research activities needed to characterize the performances of various components for WDS and ISS processes in various working conditions and configurations as needed for ITER design, an experimental facility called TRENTA and representative of the ITER WDS and ISS protium separation column has been commissioned at Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK). The TRENTA facility consists of Combined Electrolysis Catalytic Exchange (CECE) process, with an LPCE column of 8 m, in combination with a cryogenic distillation (CD) process. The processes description and the status of commissioning of TRENTA facility is presented. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Experimental validation of a method for performance monitoring, of the impurity processing stage in the TEP system of ITER	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-24)	SEP 11-15, 2006	Warsaw, POLAND			CAPER; tokamak exhaust processing (TEP); ITER fuel cycle; impurity processing		The Tokamak Exhaust Processing (TEP) system within the Tritium Plant of ITER needs to be designed such that tritium is recovered from all exhaust gases produced during different modes and operational conditions of the vacuum vessel. The reference process for the TEP system of ITER is called CAPER and comprises three different, consecutive steps to recover hydrogen isotopes at highest purity for direct transfer to the cryogenic Isotope Separation system. The second step ('impurity processing', IP) is carried out in a closed loop involving heterogeneously catalyzed cracking or conversion reactions to liberate tritium from tritiated hydrocarbons or tritiated water combined with permeation of hydrogen isotopes through a Pd/Ag permeator. This combination shifts chemical equilibria towards dehydrogenation and, therefore, enables detritiation factors higher than 1000 in the IP stage. Such a high decontamination factor requires the optimal performance of the permeator, which on the other hand is operated under conditions which provoke coking of the permeator membrane by hydrocarbon cracking. For this reason the permeator in the impurity processing loop needs to be repeatedly regenerated in order to sustain decontamination factors higher/in the order of 1000. At the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK) a method to measure the actual performance of the second stage of the CAPER process has been developed. This method has been successfully tested with the CAPER facility and appears feasible for the TEP system of ITER. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The main objective has been to assess and optimise the nuclear performance of the HCPB test blanket modules in terms of the tritium generation, the nuclear heating and the radiation shielding and provide, among others, the data required for the engineering design of the test modules. The shielding efficiency of the TBM system was shown to be sufficient to allow access of work personnel to the port extension after a waiting time of 10 days after shut down as required by ITER. The activation analyses provided the afterheat and activation data for quality assured safety analyses assuming a representative irradiation scenario. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It has been reported by the present authors that behavior of tritium release from solid breeder grain is consisted of diffusion in grain, tritium transfer at surface layer and surface reactions on grain surface such as adsorption or isotope exchange reactions. Chemical form of released tritium from Li4SiO4 (from FzK), LiAlO2 (from JAERI), Li2TiO3 (from CEA) and Li2ZrO3 (from MAPI) under various purge gas condition is discussed in this study by using the data obtained from the out-of-pile tritium release experiment in JAEA and fitting results estimated by the tritium release model formed by the present authors. And then the tritium release behavior and chemical form of tritium in the test blanket module with solid breeder under the ITER condition is also discussed based on the estimation obtained using the tritium release model.

The Y plate at 400-500 degrees C successfully recovered the low concentration of tritium dissolved in Li. Although HTO as well as HT remained in Li without T recovery, the main chemical species of tritium remaining in Li after recovery was HT, and HT and HTO was released from Y after T recovery. SEM-EDX analysis revealed the transfer of not only tritium or hydrogen but also oxygen originally included in Li. The treatment of Y by a HF acid solution was effective to remove oxides formed on the Y plate and to enhance its hydrogenating rate. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The test blanket modules project in Europe: From the strategy to the technical plan over next 10 years	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-24)	SEP 11-15, 2006	Warsaw, POLAND			ITER; TBM; HCLL; HCPB	ITER	The testing of breeding blanket concepts in ITER is recognized as an essential milestone in the development of a future reactor ensuring tritium self-sufficiency, extraction of high grade heat and electricity production. Europe is currently developing two reference breeding blankets for DEMO reactor specifications that will be tested in ITER under the form of test blanket modules (TBMs): the helium-cooled lithium-lead (HCLL) and the helium-cooled pebble-bed (HCPB) blanket concepts. Following the decision on ITER construction, the EU has reviewed and detailed the fundamental elements for implementing the future TBMs project aimed at delivering TBMs systems to ITER under suitable schedule and acceptance standards. The time schedule up to ITER operation being tight, the technical plan of the TBMs project over the next 10 years has been detailed. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The JET high frequency pellet injector project	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-24)	SEP 11-15, 2006	Warsaw, POLAND			deuterium pellet injector; ELM mitigation; JET-EP2; pellet fuelling		A new deuterium ice pellet injector is in preparation for JET. It is designed to inject both small pellets (variable volume within 1-2 mm(3)) at high frequency (up to 60 Hz) for ELM mitigation experiments and large pellets (volume within 35-70 mm(3)) at moderate frequency (up to 15 Hz) for plasma fuelling. It is based on the screw extruder technology developed by PELIN and pneumatic acceleration. An injection line will connect the injector to the flight tubes already in place to convey the pellets toward the plasma either from the low field side or from the high field side of the torus. This injection line enables: (i) the pumping of the propellant gas, (ii) the provision of the vacuum interface with the torus and (iii) the selection of the flight tube to be used via a fast selector. All the interfaces have been designed and a prototype injector is being built, to demonstrate that the required performance is achievable. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Tritium management in HCLL-PPCS model AB blanket	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-24)	SEP 11-15, 2006	Warsaw, POLAND			tritium management; HCLL blanket; tritium permeation; Sieverts' constant; CPS	HYDROGEN ISOTOPES; SOLUBILITY	When dealing with activities related to the design and optimisation of the Helium Cooled Lithium Lead (HCLL) blanket, doubts arose in the past about the technical feasibility of the tritium processing system. The questionable feasibility was due to the heavy performance requirements for different tritium processing subsystems, mainly consequence of the high tritium permeation rate from the breeding blanket into the main cooling circuit, which was claimed as an intrinsic characteristic of such a blanket concept. This was directly related to the supposed very low tritium solubility in the liquid lead lithium in eutectic composition. Recent data on the hydrogen-PbLi Sieverts' constant achieved at ENEA CR Brasimone are one order of magnitude higher than those so far assumed as reference. Because of the consequent much lower tritium permeation rate from the liquid metal into the primary cooling circuit, the performance requirements for the main tritium processing subsystems/technologies in HCLL blanket for PPCS reactor are significantly relaxed. Nevertheless, further efforts have to be focused in lowering the required Coolant Purification System (CPS) feed flow-rate which still remains the most critical tritium processing subsystems.

The tritium concentration in the helium and in the lithium lead are evaluated by solving partial differential equations governing the tritium balance, the thermal field and the lithium lead velocity field in a simplified 2D-geometrical representation of the breeder unit at the mid-equatorial plan. Using a factorial design at two levels as numerical experiments it is shown that the magnetic field and the natural convection are not relevant for the estimation of the permeation. Moreover, numerical analyses showed a developed concentration boundary layer acting as a mass transfer resistance which is equivalent to a PRF of 30. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Adaptation of the HCPB DEMO TBM as breeding blanket for ITER: Neutronic and thermal analyses	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-24)	SEP 11-15, 2006	Warsaw, POLAND			ITER; breeding blanket; HCPB; neutronic analysis; thermal analysis		This paper illustrates a neutronic and thermal analysis of an hypothetical triziogen blanket for ITER made up of modules similar to the helium cooled pebble bed (HCPB) breeding blanket, which is under studies for the DEMO reactor. Presently several research centres in Europe are engaged in developing a HCPB module which will be tested in an equatorial port of ITER. This module, called test blanket module (TBM), is being studied from the neutronic and thermo-mechanical point of view. The analyses performed by the authors use some results obtained for the HCPB-TBM found in technical literature in order to assess the implemented model. Moreover, parametric analyses for determining the tritium breeding ratio (TBR) have been performed for the TBM model as well as for the entire blanket model. The simulations, performed by means of the Monte Carlo code MCNP-4C, considered different breeder materials (lithium orthosilicate, Li4SiO4 and lithium metatitanate, Li2TiO3), different values of breeder enrichment in Li-6 (between 40% and 90%) and two structural materials (EUROFER and SiC/SiCf). For ITER, a TBR greater than 1 is obtained using a 90% enriched Li4SiO4 and SiC/SiCf as structural material. The volumetric heat fluxes obtained by the neutronic analyses have been used for determining the temperature distribution in the elementary unit of the TBM (breeder unit) and in the correspondent cell of the ITER blanket, subjected to the maximum neutronic flux. The maximum temperatures of the structural materials were lower than the allowable limits in both the examined cases. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The tritium source used was liquid lithium-lead eutectics, Pb17Li, which was poured into a space around a tubular diffusion cell used as a specimen of ferritic steel (F82H) with or without the coating on the inner surface of the cell. The irradiation time was about 4 h at 6 MW reactor power, which corresponds to a fast neuron fluence of about 2 x 10(21) n/m(2) (E > 1.1 MeV). The permeation reduction factor (PRF) was obtained by comparison of the kinetics curve of tritium permeation through the diffusion cell of F82H steel with and without the coating. The PRF at 600 degrees C was 292. This value is close to a corresponding PRF value of 307, which had been obtained at 600 degrees C, in a previous out-of-pile experiment. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

A hydrophobic platinum/styrene-divinyl benzene copolymer (Pt/SDBC) catalyst which was developed for the liquid-phase catalytic exchange (LPCE) column of the Wolsong tritium removal facility (WTRF) has been tested in a trickle bed reactor for the design of the CECE process. An experimental apparatus has been built for the testing of the catalyst at various temperatures and gas velocities. The catalyst column was packed with a mixture of a hydrophobic catalyst and a hydrophilic packing (Dixon gauze ring) to improve the liquid distribution and vapor/liquid transfer area. Many tests have been carried out at Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) to measure the activity of the catalyst, K(y)a (1 s(-1)), under various operating conditions. K(y)a increases with the hydrogen flow rates in the range of 0.4-1.6 m s(-1) at STP. The height of the catalyst column was determined from these K(y)a values according to the reaction temperatures and hydrogen flow rates. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Installation of liquid phase catalytic exchange columns for the Wolsong tritium removal facility	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-24)	SEP 11-15, 2006	Warsaw, POLAND			tritium; catalyst; detritiation; TRF; ITER	HEAVY-WATER DETRITIATION	The catalyst loading and installation of liquid phase catalytic exchange (LPCE) columns for the Wolsong tritium removal facility (WTRF) was completed on the 22nd of April 2006. Two LPCE columns are connected in series. The first column has 28 sections, a sump and a separate overhead condenser. The second column has 27 sections, a sump and a humidifier. Each section of the LPCE columns consists of three parts: mass transfer packing bed, separate catalyst bed and liquid distributor. The Sulzer CY packing for the vapor-liquid mass transfer is packed into the inner shell of each section and the wet proofed catalyst for the vapor-gas reaction is loaded into between the inner and outer shell. The liquid distributors are equipped on the Sulzer CY packing of each section. The performance test will be accomplished according to the WTRF construction and commissioning schedule. The WTRF is the first commercial facility applying LPCE process for the tritium removal. The WTRF is expected to remove 7 MCi-tritium per year at least from the Wolsong CANDU6 reactors and will be a main tritium source for the ITER. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Addition of H-2 to inert sweep gas has been proposed for enhancing the release of bred tritium from breeder material. However, the mass of Li2TiO3 has been found to decrease with time in the hydrogen atmosphere. In order to control the mass change at the time of high-temperature use, development of Li2TiO3 which has excess Li2O is needed. Li2TiO3 (L100) and Li2.1TiO3.05 (L105) were prepared by solid-state reaction at 1273 K of Li2CO3 and TiO2 powders. In thermogravimetry, the masses of samples L100 and L105 were found to decrease with time in a hydrogen atmosphere, then to increase after a change of the atmosphere from hydrogen to oxygen. Sample L105 has fewer oxygen defects than L100. An atmosphere-controlled high-temperature mass spectrometer has provided the vapor pressure data for L100 and L105, under the conditions of D-2 atmospheres. Sample L105 has a higher partial pressure of total Li-containing species than L100 above 1093 K. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.

TRIEX facility: An experimental loop to test tritium extraction systems from lead lithium	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-24)	SEP 11-15, 2006	Warsaw, POLAND			tritium; HCLL; lead lithium	HYDROGEN EXTRACTION; PACKED-COLUMN; PB-17LI; SOLUBILITY	The first and main step of the HCLL (helium cooled lithium lead) blanket fuel cycle consists of tritium extraction from the liquid breeder. In DEMO reactor a dedicated system, called TES (tritium extraction system), will be devoted to accomplish this task. Different technologies, belonging to the families of gas-liquid contactors, getters and tritium permeators have been studied in the last years, some of them mainly theoretically, others with much more experimental effort. Gas-liquid contactors, which have been more experimentally studied, showed contradictory results. Plate, spray and bubble columns resulted in a very low-extraction efficiency. On the contrary, packed columns gave better results, although some doubts arise about the accuracy of the experiments performed in the past. However, packed columns seem to be the most attractive technology and for this reason was decided for a further optimisation and testing of their performances. In order to accomplish this task, a dedicated facility called TRIEX (tritium extraction) was designed and built and is now available in ENEA-Brasimone. In TRIEX the extraction efficiency of different packed columns will be tested in a systematic way paying particular attention to the hydrogen monitoring system in gas and liquid metal phase. The design and the main instrumentation of TRIEX facility, as well as the operating modes and the planned experimental campaign are presented in this paper. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

A CMSB mock-up in a semi-technical scale (1/6 of the flow rate of the ITER-HCPB) was designed and constructed at the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe. In this work, the adsorption isotherms of hydrogen and deuterium on the MS5A adsorbent were investigated by the volumetric method. The correlation of the experimental adsorption isotherms of hydrogen and deuterium on the MS5A adsorbent were performed. To validate the cryogenic adsorption process, breakthrough experiments were performed using the CMSB mock-up. The experimental breakthrough curves obtained were analyzed with model mass balance equations, and scale-up numerical simulations were carried out. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In-pile tritium release behaviour of lithiummetatitanate produced by extrusion-spheroidisation-sintering process in EXOTIC-9/1 in the high flux reactor, Petten	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-24)	SEP 11-15, 2006	Warsaw, POLAND			tritium release; irradiation; lithiummetatitanate; helium cooled pebble bed	CERAMIC BREEDER	The irradiation programme EXOTIC (extraction of tritium in ceramics) is carried out within the European framework for the development of the helium cooled pebble bed concept. The EXOTIC-9/1 is the latest experiment in the series of EXOTICs that are irradiated in the high flux reactor in Petten. Tritium release and inventory in lithium containing ceramic pebbles are key properties to be tested in a TBM. New production routes of pebbles are developed, leading to different thermornechanical and tritium release properties. The objective of the EXOTIC-9/1 is to study in-pile tritium release behaviour of the latest developed lithiummetatitanate pebbles (Li2TiO3). The pebbles are produced by a extrusion-spheroidisation-sintering process at CEA. The new pebbles differ with respect to porosity from the lithiummetatitanate ceramics tested in the previous EXOTIC 8 programme. The pebbles have diameter in the range from 0. 6 to 0. 8 mm. Irradiation of EXOTC-9/1 started at 24 March 2005, and will continue until the end of 2006, in total about 400 irradiation days. The temperature is varied between 340 and 580 degrees C. Begin of Life (BOL) tritium production rate is 0.56 mCi/min. Based upon the in-pile tritium release measurements and the analysis of the tritium residence time it can be concluded that tritium release in the new batch of the high density Li2TiO3 pebbles irradiated in EXOTIC 9/1 is rather slow compared to the ceramics irradiated in the EXOTIC 8 irradiation campaign. In this paper, the in-pile tritium behaviour will be reported during normal operation and during transients in temperature, purge gas chemistry and gasflow. The collected data is compared to tritium release data from ceramics irradiated in previous EXOTIC experiments with respect to tritium inventory, residence time and porosity. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Analysis of three LOCAs for the European HCPB test blanket system	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-24)	SEP 11-15, 2006	Warsaw, POLAND			ITER; safety; test blanket module; blanket development	INTEGRATION; ITER	Three LOCA sequences have been analysed in the frame of the safety assessment of the European helium cooled pebble bed (HCPB) test blanket module (TBM) system. These three sequences have been selected as representative of accidents judged to cover all scenarios envisaged in the design basis involving the TBMs. The three groups of accidents investigated with their parametric variations have as initiating event a loss of coolant accident at different location: in-vessel, in-box, and ex-vessel. In general the reduced inventory of activation products and Tritium associated with the TBM System makes the impact of this test system almost negligible to the overall safety risk of ITER. Nevertheless, the possibility to jeopardise the ITER safety concept has been analysed especially in connection to particular sequences that imply the pressurisation of the vacuum vessel due to the He coolant blow-down, the hydrogen and/or heat production from Be-steam or Be-air reaction and the necessity to assure the heat removal in the short and long period.

In order to introduce action of radiation and MF in post-irradiation investigations of the tritium release from the blanket materials, a special rig for thermo-annealing of pre-irradiated samples at a high temperature up to 1120 K under irradiation with fast electrons of 5 MeV and dose rate 14 MGy/h in MF up to 1.7 T was used for this study. A delay of the tritium release in MF of 2.4 T at thermo-annealing of the lithium orthosilicate Li4SiO4 pebbles (FZK) irradiated in the EXOTIC-8/8 experiment was observed. Chemical forms of the tritium localised in the pebbles and the tritium distribution were determined (up to 75%, in T+). The main form of the tritium localized in the beryllium pebbles irradiated in the BERYLLIUM experiment is T-2 (85-95%). A stimulating effect of a MF of 1.7 T on the tritium release from the Be pebbles at the annealing at 1120 K under the radiation was observed (up to 80%). (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, some concern exists with Be pebbles, mostly because of the uncertainty of T-release properties during DEMO reactor operation conditions. Since the recent past, beryllides like Be12Ti are considered to be one of the most promising materials for advanced neutron multipliers due to their relatively high melting point, good chemical and corrosion stability and much better tritium release behaviour compared to pure Be. Development of scaleable manufacturing methods bypassing the intrinsic brittleness of beryllides is considered to be the most challenging.

A constitutive model for the thermo-mechanical behaviour of fusion-relevant pebble beds and its application to the simulation of HELICA mock-up experimental results	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-24)	SEP 11-15, 2006	Warsaw, POLAND			lithiated ceramic breeder; pebble beds; thermo-mechanical constitutive model; HCPB-TBM	THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; BREEDER; BLANKET; FLOW	Within the framework of the R&D activities promoted by EFDA on the Helium-Cooled Pebble Bed Test Blanket Module to be irradiated in ITER, attention has been focused on the modelling of the thermo-mechanical behaviour of both beryllium and lithiated ceramic pebble beds that are envisaged to be used respectively as neutron multiplier and tritium breeder. This behaviour depends, mainly, on the reactor-relevant conditions, the pebble sizes and the breeder cell geometries and a general constitutive model has not yet been validated, especially for fusion-relevant applications. ENEA-Brasimone and the Department of Nuclear Engineering (DIN) of the University of Palermo have performed intense research activities on this topic by means of an integrated experimental and theoretical approach. In particular, HELICA mock-up has been set-up and tested at the HE-FUS3 facility of ENEA-Brasimone to investigate the behaviour of lithiated ceramic pebble beds in reactor-relevant geometries, providing useful data sets on which DIN has validated its constitutive model. The paper presents the main features of the DIN constitutive model and results of two test campaigns on HELICA-mockup. The comparison between experimental results and numerical predictions is reported too, showing a good agreement that encourages the adoption of the DIN constitutive model. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Experimental validation of upgraded designs for PERMCAT reactors considering mechanical behaviour of Pd/Ag membranes under H-2 atmosphere	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-24)	SEP 11-15, 2006	Warsaw, POLAND			ITER; D-T fuel cycle; Tokamak Exhaust Processing; Pd/Ag permeation membrane; isotope exchange reactions; Nickel catalyst	ITER FUEL-CYCLE; PALLADIUM; HYDROGEN; SYSTEM; TRITIUM; SOLUBILITY; ALLOY; GAS	The PERMCAT process chosen for the final clean-up stage of the Tokamak Exhaust Processing system of the ITER tritium plant combines in a single component a catalytic reactor and a permeator using Pd/Ag membranes. This study covers the mechanical behaviour of a Pd/Ag membrane under different operating conditions. The consequences of hydrogen uptake by the membrane during nominal operation but also during off-normal events are presented. Depending on the operating conditions, expansions around 2% and significant deformations are observed. Different mechanical designs of PERNICAT reactors are then discussed. The first generation comprises finger-type membranes and two new mechanical designs use either additional edge welded bellows or a special corrugated Pd/Ag membrane. These upgraded designs improve the robustness and simplify the geometry of the component. The experimental validation of these new units has been carried out based on the measurements of the processing capabilities with regards to isotopic exchanges between H2O and D-2. For the first time experimental results obtained on different PERMCAT reactors are compared. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Treatment of ITER plasma facing components: Current status and remaining open issues before ITER implementation	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-24)	SEP 11-15, 2006	Warsaw, POLAND			detritiation techniques; fuel cycle; ITER	NITROGEN INJECTION; FUSION MACHINES; ASDEX-UPGRADE; TORE-SUPRA; 1ST WALL; REMOVAL; CARBON; JET; TILES; RETENTION	The in-vessel tritium inventory control is one of the most ITER challenging issues which has to be resolved to fulfil safety requirements. This is due mainly to the presence of carbon as a constituent of plasma facing components (PFCs) which leads to a high fuel permanent retention. For several years now, physics studies and technological developments have been undertaken worldwide in order to develop reliable techniques which could be used in ITER severe environment (magnetic field, vacuum, high temperature) for in situ tritium recovery. The scope of this contribution is to review the present status of these achievements and define the remaining work to be done in order to propose a dedicated work program. Different treatment techniques (chemical treatments, photonic cleaning) will be reviewed. In the frame of ITER, they will be compared in terms of fuel removal rate as well as surface accessibility, type of production (gas or particulates), ability to clean mixed material. And lastly, consequences of bulk trapping observed in tokamak on the techniques currently under development will be addressed. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

With the same plasma size as that of ITER, net electric power up to 600 MW is possible with beta(N) > 4.0, H> 1.0 and a divertor heat load of H-div < 15 MW/m(2). Through a consideration of the requirements for a DEMO-relevant blanket concept, Korea has proposed a He cooled molten lithium (HCML) blanket as an ITER TBM. It uses He as a coolant and Li is used as a tritium breeder by considering its potential advantages. Low activation Ferritic Steel (FS) is used as a structural material and two layers of graphite are inserted as a reflector in the breeder zone to increase the tritium breeding ratio (TBR) and the shielding performances. The design and the performance of the KO HCML test blanket module (TBM) are being modified in terms of its He coolant efficiency and its optimized path with a performance analysis; with a 3D Monte Carlo analysis (MCCARD code) for the neutronics; with the CFD code (CFX-10) for the thermal-hydraulics; with ANSYS-10 for the thermo-mechanical analysis.

Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses of the tritium production in the HCPB breeder blanket mock-up experiment	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-24)	SEP 11-15, 2006	Warsaw, POLAND			tritium breeder blanket; tritium production rate; neutronics; nuclear cross sections; sensitivity analysis; uncertainty analysis	MONTE-CARLO	A neutronics experiment performed at the Frascati Neutron Generator (FNG) on a mock-up of the Helium-Cooled Pebble Bed (HCPB) breeder test blanket module (TBM) has been analysed on the basis of neutron transport, sensitivity and uncertainty calculations using both deterministic and probabilistic computational methods. The calculations revealed a slight but systematic underestimation of the measured tritium activities by 5 to 10% on average, independent of the nuclear data used that were taken from the EFF-3 and FENDL-2.0, -2. 1 data files. The uncertainty assessments showed data related uncertainties of the calculated tritium production rates at a level of 4% (2 sigma confidence level). The beryllium cross-section data were shown to be the main source of these uncertainties. The total uncertainties of the tritium production prediction including the data uncertainties, the statistical uncertainties of the Monte Carlo calculation and the experimental uncertainties are in the order of 8 to 10% (2 sigma). The observed underestimation of the measured tritium production is at the lower bound of the assessed uncertainty margin. The obtained results indicate that design calculations for the tritium breeding ratio (TBR) of fusion power reactors employing a HCPB type breeder blanket are conservative. Thus, an additional TBR margin is provided which allows compensation for potential other uncertainties. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Mechanical response of oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) EUROFER97 after neutron irradiation at 300 degrees C	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-24)	SEP 11-15, 2006	Warsaw, POLAND			EUROFER97; ODS; mechanical properties; neutron irradiation; microstructural investigations	RAFM STEEL EUROFER97; BLANKET	EUROFER97 is a 9Cr-1W-0.2V-0. 1Ta reduced activation ferritic/martensitic (RAFM) steel, presently considered within the European Union as the primary candidate structural material in a fusion power plant. Its mechanical strength properties currently prevent its use at temperatures higher than 500-550 degrees C. In an effort to extend the range of operating temperatures to 600-650 degrees C and therefore enhance the efficiency of the machine, a different production route, oxide dispersion strengthening (ODS), is being investigated. The characteristics of different versions of EUROFER97 ODS have been assessed in recent years, leading to the improvement of the material by a combination of optimized production process and post-HIPping thermal treatment. Until recently, the mechanical properties of EUROFER97 ODS had only been investigated in the unirradiated condition, and no information was available for the irradiation response of the material. However, mechanical samples have been irradiated during 2004-2005 at 300 degrees C in the Belgian Reactor 2 (BR2) in Mol up to an accumulated dose of 1.73 +/- 0.07 dpa; post-irradiation tensile, Charpy impact and fracture toughness tests have been performed in the hot cell laboratories of the Belgian Nuclear Centre (SCK-CEN). The results obtained allow quantitatively assessing the degradation of mechanical properties induced by neutron irradiation. Comparisons are also presented with similar results obtained from base (non-ODS) EUROFER97, previously irradiated in BR2 under comparable conditions (temperature and dose).

Behavior of Be-7, such as solubility and deposition in the liquid lithium was estimated considering temperature gradient in the loop. The result showed that all most all Be-7, 5.02 x 10(15) Bq, would be deposited on most downstream part of the heat exchanger with the lowest temperature among the main flow. Subsequent estimation for dose equivalent rate due to this localized radioactive source showed that, without radiation shielding, the rate would be 8.5 x 10(7) mu Sv/h, about seven orders of magnitude higher than a guideline of 10 mu Sv/h for yearly working time of 2000 h. Required thickness of radiation shield made of lead was found to be 8 cm. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It was found that the deuterium (D) retention decreases as the implantation temperature increases in both non-He+ pre-implanted SiC and He+ pre-implanted SiC after D-2(+) implantation. Above 800 K, D bound only to C in forming C-D bonds. The chemical states of Si 2p for non-He+ pre-implanted SiC and He+ pre-implanted SiC at implantation temperatures above 800 K are quite different from those at room temperature and a positive peak shift of Si 2p was observed, indicating Si-C-D bonds were formed without larger amount of retention of damaged structures. These facts indicate that damaged structures introduced by D-2(+) and/or He+ implantation are quickly recovered by the thermal annealing effect at temperature above 800 K. These results imply that the thermal annealing effect influence widely on the tritium behavior and damaged structures in SiC. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Investigation of the susceptibility of EUROFER97 in lead-lithium to liquid metal embrittlement (LME)	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-24)	SEP 11-15, 2006	Warsaw, POLAND			LME; SSRT; hot cell; lead-lithium	STAINLESS-STEEL; PB-17LI	Liquid metal embrittlement (LME) is defined as the brittle fracture (loss of ductility) of usually ductile materials in the presence of a liquid metal. The sensitivity to LME is likely to increase with irradiation hardening as localised stresses can promote the aggressive action of a liquid metal. To investigate the mechanical response of irradiated materials in contact with a liquid metal, an instrumented hot cell has been developed. The testing machine installed inside allows mechanical testing of active materials in liquid lead lithium under well controlled chemistry conditions. Typical mechanical tests that can be carried out are slow strain rate tests (SSRT), constant load and rising load tests at temperatures from 150 degrees C to 500 degrees C. In this paper the first results of the SSRT tests with EUROFER97 in argon and lead-lithium at different temperatures with different strain rates will be presented. The SSRT test method has been chosen due to the accelerated nature of the test, i.e., during straining the oxide layer will be ruptured and wetting of the sample surface by the lead-lithium melt is promoted. The results collected up till now showed no sign of LME. Tests with longer pre-exposure times and tests with irradiated samples will be carried out in the next phase. A longer pre-exposure time can enhance wetting and so the susceptibility to LME. An increase of the yield stress due to irradiation can also enhance the susceptibility to LME. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The measurements were performed over the temperature range of 420-777 K with hydrogen driving pressures ranging from 2.5 x 10(3) to 1.0 x 10(5) Pa. The resultant diffusive transport parameters are a permeability of Phi (mol m(-1) Pa-1/2 s(-1)) = 1.22 x 10(-8) exp(-34.6 (kJ mol(-1))/RT), a diffusivity of D (m(2) s(-1)) = 1.33 x 10(-6) exp(-30.4 (kJ mol(-1))/RT) and a Sieverts' constant of Ks (Mol m(-3) Pa-1/2) = 9.21 x 10(-3) exp(-4.2 (kJ mol(-1))/RT). The resultant trapping parameters have been a trap density of N-t = 2.0 x 10(25) m(-3) and trapping energy of E-t=44.9kJmol(-1). All the hydrogen transport parameters obtained for the ODS-EUROFER are compared to the available data obtained for the base material EUROFER in order to study the influence of the particular micro-structure of ODS in the hydrogen transport. Other RAFM steels of the same kind are included in the comparative analysis. The presence of yttria nanoparticles induces a marked trapping phenomenon and provokes a decrease in the diffusivity and an increase in the solubility of hydrogen in the material at low temperature.

Hydrogenic species transport model for ceramic alumina used in ITER ICRH H&CD & Diagnostics Systems	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-24)	SEP 11-15, 2006	Warsaw, POLAND			tritium; insulator ceramics; radiation effects; ICRH design; ITER safety	AL2O3	A transport model for deuterium and tritium in Al2O3 under Ion Cyclotron Radiation Heating (ICRH) Vacuum Window (VW) operational conditions is presented. The aim is to provide a broad evaluation of permeation fluxes and soluted/trapped inventories in this material. A phenomenological release-rate transport model is formulated. The operational physical scenarios of the alumina VW in the ICRH line, in particular ionising doses and local electric fields, are analysed with special attention paid to the system design assumptions defining neutrals and implanted H-isotopes source terms in the VW. Available transport data for alumina is discussed and taken as a reference base for a parametric exercise. Results show significantly high values of D/T concentrations, both trapped and mobile, in the VW material. For the VW lifetimes, the fluxes across the VW, are seen to be clearly below established ITER Design Requirement Guidelines. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Natural convection cooling of the IFMIF target and test cell	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-24)	SEP 11-15, 2006	Warsaw, POLAND			IFMIF; natural convection; helium cooling		The present work summarizes efforts on the simulation of natural convection cooling within the IFMIF target and test cell. The simulations have been performed with the STAR-CD code using the k-omega high-Reynolds number turbulence model. A dedicated thermohydraulic model has been devised including Lithium loop components. Nuclear heat production has been calculated by the Monte-Carlo code McDeLicious for different parts of the target and test cell walls and was used as input for the STAR-Cl) simulations. Helium atmospheres at several pressures from 0.1 to 10(-5) MPa have been investigated. In order to limit the maximum temperature of the concrete walls to 80 degrees C it was necessary to add thermal insulation layers to the hot Lithium loop surfaces and a conceptual system of two cooling layers in different depths of the concrete walls.

The code handles liquid or gaseous coolants encountered in fusion devices. The physical model comprises fluid flow (pressure drop, flow and pumping power), mass transfer (corrosion) and radioactive decay (activation) in irradiation conditions. Solubility dictates precipitation and/or crud formation and deposition. TRACT is written in the IDL language with a graphical user interface. The parameters are provided by the u ser. A network is the combination of channel configuration and circulating fluid and parameters comprise pipes joining at n odes. The network topology, size-metrics and materials of channels are free, to construct an arbitrary network. The layout can be in 3-D space (elevation with gravity included), allowing for breaks and disconnected loops. An example case for IFMIF demonstrates the layout loop, its components (fittings, cooler, tank, target, 3-D elevation), flow, pumping power and corrosion, dissolution, precipitation and deposition of material. Calculations show the target flow velocity at 20.4 m/s, the cooler and pump pressure drop at 4.75 and 19.3 kPa, respectively, the pump power needed to circulate the lithium coolant at 2.5 kW, and the net positive suction head (pump inlet) at 40 kPa. The average corrosion, dissolution and deposition, normalised to solid density at about 16 months, are 34, 29 and 29 pm, respectively. The dissolution is 4.192 x 10(-9) kg/m(2)s, and the masses released 66 kg and deposited 34 kg. The code is capable, and was developed, to be used for a general purpose cooling loop of any fusion components. Crown Copyright (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

Assessment of occupational radiation exposure (ORE) for hands-on assistance to the remote handling at ITER ports and waste treatment	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-24)	SEP 11-15, 2006	Warsaw, POLAND			ITER; ORE; remote handling; waste treatment		The occupational radiation exposure (ORE) assessment for ITER systems is evolving as design makes progress. This paper deals with the ORE assessments for two important ITER activities: those in the assistance to the remote handling on a port plug hosting diagnostics and those carried out in the Waste Treatment System. For the former a software tool has been developed to handle the large amount of data processed and to allow user friendly updating of data as design or maintenance procedures evolves, and, know-how on maintenance activities improves. A systematic approach was adopted to evaluate work efforts (WE) needed to execute specific tasks. The so-called "elementary works" were identified and classified and the time required to perform the operation and involved people were estimated. The elementary works were then aggregated in the so-called main operations (e.g. window replacement, pipe removal, etc.). For each of them, on the base of expected maintenance frequency and dose rate fields, total WE and worker doses were calculated. It was assessed that hands-on activities in the Equatorial Port No. I require 472 person h of WE leading to a collective dose of similar to 7.4 person mSv/year. The most critical operation in terms of worker doses is the sealing/unsealing of port plug, which weights for about the 23% of the total. The second ORE assessment was related to the management of ITER operational radioactive wastes. These wastes include streams originated in the plant from the experimental and maintenance activities, with exclusion of those generated inside the Tokamak that will be highly activated and will be managed inside the Hot Cell Processing System. The estimated collective annual dose related to the Waste Treatment System ranges between similar to 4.3 and similar to 4.9 person mSv. The two values depend on the assumptions made for the exposure levels in the operative areas. Both studies have to be considered as preliminary as far as the results are concerned due to the quite rough input data (on dose rates and design details), while the approach might be considered sound and up to date.

Burnup calculation of fusion-fission hybrid energy system with thorium cycle	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-24)	SEP 11-15, 2006	Warsaw, POLAND			fusion-fission hybrid reactor; ITER; JT-60; Monte Carlo; burnup; nuclear transmutation; thorium		A fusion-fission hybrid reactor which is a fusion reactor with a blanket region containing nuclear fuel. In our group, a calculation system for analysis of fusion-fission hybrid reactor has been developed and various transport and burnup calculations were carried out for hybrid systems with U-Pu fuel cycle and ITER model so far. It was confirmed that such system is feasible and even beneficial. However, there is difficulty to hold down the production rate of minor actinides. Thus, the study of fusion-fission hybrid energy system with Th-U fuel cycle was performed. The calculations for hybrid system with U-Pu fuel cycle were carried out again because of development of the calculation system. As a result of analysis, a fusion-fission hybrid system with thorium fuel cycle meets requirements which include self-sufficiency of tritium, subcriticality of the system and acceptable cooling capability. In comparison with U-Pu cycle, the production rate of minor actinides of Th-U fuel cycle is generally lower than that of U-Pu cycle as expected. In addition, we investigated two different coolants of helium gas and water. The water-cooled blanket is suitable for energy generation. On the other hand, gas-cooled blanket has an advantage in FP transmutation. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

State of the art of fusion material recycling and remaining issues	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-24)	SEP 11-15, 2006	Warsaw, POLAND			fusion; waste; recycling; reuse; clearance; material		One of the safety and environmental advantages of fusion is the limited amount of long lived generated radioactive waste which might be a burden for future generations. But even if fusion produces little, if any, long term waste there are two important aspects deserving consideration: the large amounts of tritium contamination and of neutron activated materials. Recycling has been proposed as a means to keep radioactive waste levels to a minimum, after adequate decay period and proper handling and treatment. Treatment includes detritiation, separation and sorting of different materials, among others. Moreover if recycling or reuse are foreseen, processes for reuse and refabrication have to be made on an industrial scale. Even if some experience on recycling exists in the nuclear fission industry which can be used for fusion materials, differences arise due to tritium contamination and levels of activation. This paper presents a review of the current situation and state-of-the-art recycling methods for typical materials and components of fusion plants based on current conceptual design studies. It focuses attention on R&D issues to be addressed in order to be able to recycle as much material as possible in a safe, economical and environmentally friendly manner. Recycling of fusion materials is a huge challenge and presents important spin-offs for the fusion industry. Solutions and routes to follow should be developed as soon as possible in order to tackle this important issue as it arises. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Impact of N-isotope composition control of ferritic steel on classification of radioactive materials from fusion reactor	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-24)	SEP 11-15, 2006	Warsaw, POLAND			carbon-14; nitrogen-15; enrichment; radioactive material; reduced-activation ferritic steel; fusion reactor	SOLID BREEDER BLANKET; SUPERCRITICAL-WATER; DESIGN; JAERI	The possibility of reducing the concentration of C-14 produced in irradiation of reduced activation ferritic steels (RAFS) intended as structural materials in first wall and blanket of fusion power plants was investigated. During RAFS irradiation C-14 is mainly produced from the more abundant of the two isotopes of nitrogen present in the steel, namely N-14. The method proposed consists in increasing the enrichment of the other isotope (N-15). One-dimension transport calculations show that for a typical DEMO blanket configuration an N-15 enrichment from the natural value (0.37%) to 95% was sufficient to keep the end of life C-14 concentration in the RAFS below the limit (3.7 x 10(7) Bq/kg) fixed by the Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission for qualifying it as a low level material (LLM) which can be disposed by shallow land burial.

Activation and clearance of vanadium alloys and beryllium multipliers in fusion reactors	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-24)	SEP 11-15, 2006	Warsaw, POLAND			vanadium alloys; beryllium; clearance; extraction reprocessing; activation products		The possibility of clearance of vanadium-chromium-titanium (V-Cr-Ti) alloys is analysed. These alloys after their service in fusion power plants, have the potential to reach clearance if they are purified from activation products. The extraction part of the technological scheme for radiochemical separation of components of irradiated V-Cr-Ti alloy and their purification from metallic activation products, developed earlier, was tested for the first time in laboratory conditions using activated alloy specimens. The replacement of the acid reextraction of V with peroxide and of acid reextraction of Cr with alkaline improved characteristics of the extraction reprocessing. Duration of the V and Cr reextraction was shortened by about an order of magnitude, the output of these alloy components was increased, V purification from rare-earth metals became two times as great, and Cr decontamination from Co increased by two orders of magnitude. Activation of Be contaminated with trace quantities of uranium is an issue: estimation of Be activation in the blanket of the Power Plant Conceptual Study (PPCS) has suggested that traces of U impurity in Be should be removed - or substantially reduced - prior to use.

In the radio-frequency heating technology, development of 170 GHz ITER gyrotron has progressed to achieve a 600 kW for 3600 sec operation in JAEA RF test stand In LHD, long-pulse operations near I hour with 1.6 GJ inputs have been achieved with ICH and ECH, and subcooled operations of SC magnets to improve cryogenic stability are scheduled soon. In the ITER Test Blanket Modules project, Japan has a plan to lead a water cooled ceramic breeder blanket concept, and to cooperate with other parties on other blanket concepts, such as, a helium cooled ceramic breeder blanket, a LiPb blanket, a Li/V blanket, and a molten salt blanket. As the Broader Approach activities between Europe and Japan, ITER satellite tokamak, JT-60SA, IFMIF-EVEDA and the International Fusion Energy Research Center programs will start soon in Naka and Rokkasho, respectively. Basic researches on broad areas have been enhanced with collaborations in the Fusion Engineering Network among Japanese universities and research institutes.

J	Taylor, NP; Raskob, W				Taylor, Neill P.; Raskob, Wolfgang			Updated accident consequence analyses for ITER at Cadarache	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion Energy	NOV 12-16, 2006	Albuquerque, NM					Throughout the various phases of the ITER project, extensive safety analyses have been performed to ensure that potential hazards to the public, the environment, and personnel are minimized. This work, done before a location for ITER had. been chosen, resulted in a very comprehensive assessment of ITER safety in terms of the impact at a "generic site". By making good use of the favourable safety and environmental characteristics of fusion, a very good outcome was achieved. Now that the Cadarache site, in southern France, has been selected for ITER construction, it is necessary to reanalyze the impact of postulated accidental releases of tritium and activated material, taking into account the specific conditions of the site. These include regulatory requirements on dose limits and on assumptions to be made in analyses, as well as local environmental factors such as weather conditions, population demographics, and local food production and consumption patterns. This paper discusses the impact on the ITER safety case of new dispersion and dose calculations for accidental releases, taking into account these site-specific conditions; These indicate that doses arising from the release masses calculated for the most challenging accident scenario in previous generic-site studies will meet the new dose limits by a very large margin.

Axisymmetric tandem mirror magnetic fusion energy power plant with thick liquid-walls	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion Energy	NOV 12-16, 2006	Albuquerque, NM				KINETIC STABILIZER; SHEATH; FIELD	A fusion power plant is described that utilizes a new version of the tandem mirror device including spinning liquid walls. The magnetic configuration is evaluated with an axisymmetric equilibrium code predicting an average beta of 60%. The geometry allows a flowing molten salt, (flibe-Li2BeF4), which protects the walls and structures from damage arising from neutrons and plasma particles. The surface of the liquid facing the burning plasma is heated by bremsstrahlung radiation, line radiation, and by neutrons. The temperature of the free surface of the liquid is calculated and then the evaporation rate is estimated from vapor-pressure data. The allowed impurity concentration in the burning plasma is taken as 1% fluorine, which gives a 17% reduction in the fusion power owing to D/T fuel dilution, with F line-radiation causing minor power degradation. The end leakage power density of 0.6 MW/m(2) is readily handled by liquid jets. The tritium breeding is adequate with natural lithium. The simple geometry and the use of liquid walls promise the cost Of power competitive with that from fission and coal.

Cryogenic target handling, transfer and positioning system for the Laser MegaJoule	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion Energy	NOV 12-16, 2006	Albuquerque, NM					The Laser MegaJoule (LW) program plans to obtain Deuterium-Tritium (DT) mixture ignition leading to a fusion gain of ten. Cryogenic targets are hollow spheres whose interiors is covered with a solid cryogenic fuel layer. The success of DT ignition depends on quality of the fuel layer uniformity. These targets must be cooled and kept at temperatures near the triple point (19.8 K) with a very good stability (+/-1 mK) for many hours, in the center of the 5 in radius experimental vacuum chamber with a position accuracy of a few microns. In order to validate our current device concepts, we have manufactured scale one prototypes to confirm all thermal and mechanical challenges, such as sharp thermal regulation, cooling autonomy and cryogenic target transfer.

Hydrogen isotope retentions and erosion/deposition profiles in the first wall of JT-60U	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion Energy	NOV 12-16, 2006	Albuquerque, NM				PLASMA-FACING COMPONENTS; TRITIUM RETENTION; CARBON; ITER	To investigate retention characteristics of hydrogen isotopes in the first wall tiles made of isotropic graphite of JT-60U, surface morphology, erosion/deposition profiles and hydrogen isotope retentions were examined by SEM, US, TDS and SIMS. It was found that poloidal deuterium retention profile was rather uniform, while the thermal desorption behavior of deuterium was quite different depending on the locations of the tiles. Deuterium retained in the upper first wall, which was covered by thick boron layers with high concentration Of B, was desorbed at lower temperature than that in the lower area covered by carbon layers with much less B content. Hydrogen retained during the boronization has significant contribution on the total hydrogen retention. DIH ratio in the first wall tiles was appreciably higher than that observed in the divertor tiles. Probably, the lower temperature of thefirst wall compared to that of the divertor tiles would prohibit desorption of the implanted deuterium and/or its replacement by subsequent D or H impingement. The injection of high energy deuteron originating from NBI into the first wall could have some contribution on the high hydrogen retention of the first wall.

A niobium sheet kept at high temperature (420 degrees C was used as a reference specimen. Sufficiently high absorption rates were obtained even at around room temperature in the range of incident fluxes from 1017 to.1021 m(-2)s(-1). No noticeable reduction in absorption rated was observed up to the H retention level of 0. 1 aft The influence of CO and water vapor was negligibly small up to an exposure of 1023 m(-2). Significant reduction in the absorption rate was observed only when an oxide film was formed on the surface by exposure to 02 to 1020 m(-2) and to H2O over 1023 m(-2) at room temperature.
