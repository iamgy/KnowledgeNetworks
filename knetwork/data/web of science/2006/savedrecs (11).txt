For reasons of reactivity control of such fuels, burnable poisons (BP) will have to be used. The impact of different possible BP candidates (B, Eu, Er and Gd) on the achievable burnup as well as on safety and non-proliferation aspects of IMF are analyzed. To this end, cell burnup calculations have been performed and burnup dependent reactivity coefficients (boron worth, fuel temperature and moderator void coefficient) were calculated. All BP candidates were analyzed for one initial BP concentration and a range of different initial plutonium-concentrations (0.4-1.0 g cm(-3)) for reactor-grade plutonium isotopic composition as well as for weapon-grade plutonium. For the two most promising BP candidates (Er and Gd), a range of different BP concentrations was investigated to study the impact of BP concentration on fuel burnup. A set of reference fuels was identified to compare the performance of uranium-fuels, MOX and IMF with respect to (1) the fraction of initial plutonium being burned, (2) the remaining absolute plutonium concentration in the spent fuel and (3) the shift in the isotopic composition of the remaining plutonium leading to differences in the heat and neutron rate produced. In the case of IMF, the remaining Pu in spent fuel is unattractive for a would be proliferator. This underlines the attractiveness of an IMF approach for disposal of Pu from a non-proliferation perspective. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Since the fissile and transuranic (TRU) elements in the spent nuclear fuel present a proliferation risk, limit the repository capacity, and are the major contributors to the long-term toxicity and dose from the repository, methods and systems are needed to reduce the amount of TRU that will eventually require long-term storage. An option to achieve a reduction in the amount, and modify the isotopic composition of TRU requiring geological disposal is 'burning' the TRU in commercial light water reactors (LWRs) and/or fast reactors. Fuel forms under consideration for TRU destruction in light water reactors (LWRs) include mixed-oxide (MOX), advanced mixed-oxide, and inert matrix fuels. Fertile-free inert matrix fuel (IMF) has been proposed for use in many forms and studied by several researchers. IMF offers several advantages relative to MOX, principally it provides a means for reducing the TRU in the fuel cycle by burning the fissile isotopes and transmuting the minor actinides while producing no new TRU elements from fertile isotopes. This paper will present and discuss the results of a four-bundle, neutronic, thermal-hydraulic, and transient analyses of proposed inert matrix materials in comparison with the results of similar analyses for reference UOX fuel bundles. The results of this work are to be used for screening purposes to identify the general feasibility of utilizing specific inert matrix fuel compositions in existing and future light water reactors. Compositions identified as feasible using the results of these analyses still require further detailed neutronic, thermal-hydraulic, and transient analysis study coupled with rigorous experimental testing and qualification.

While the OTTO irradiation is already completed.. the other two irradiations are still ongoing. The objectives of the experiments differ: for OTTO, the focus was on the comparison of different concepts of IMF, i.e. homogeneous fuel versus different types of heterogeneous fuel. In IFA-651, single phase yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) doped with Pu is compared with MOX. In IFA-652, the potential of calcia stabilized zirconia (CSZ) as a matrix with and without thoria is evaluated. The design of the three experiments is explained and the current status is reviewed. The experiments show that the homogeneous, single phase YSZ-based or CSZ-based fuel show good and stable irradiation behaviour. It can be said that homogeneous stabilized zirconia based fuel is the most promising IMF concept for an LWR environment. Nevertheless, the fuel temperatures were relatively high due to the low thermal conductivity, potentially leading to high fission gas release, and must be taken into account in the fuel design.

The developed models were first verified with urania UO2, then applied for prediction of the isobaric specific heat, the isobaric thermal expansion coefficient, and the thermal conductivity of ThO2 and of one inert matrix material: ZrO2. The similarity principle was used in the cases where the input data were missing. The obtained results were compared with the available experimental data, and satisfactory agreement was demonstrated in the temperature range of 30-1600 K. In most of the cases the predicted values were within the region of the dispersion of the experimental data. The largest difference was observed for the thermal conductivity of ZrO2 at high temperatures, which could be explained by unaccounted photon contribution. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Evaluation of thermal conductivity of zirconia-based inert matrix fuel by molecular dynamics simulation	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Nuclear Materials held at the 2005 Spring Meeting of the European-Materials-Research-Society	MAY 31-JUN 02, 2005	Strasbourg, FRANCE	European Materials Res Soc			YTTRIA-STABILIZED ZIRCONIA; MIXED-OXIDE FUEL; COMPUTER-SIMULATION; OXYGEN DIFFUSION; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; ALKALI-HALIDES; HEAT-CAPACITY; NUCLEAR-FUEL; 2000 K; MECHANISM	Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed using Born-Mayer-Huggins interatomic potentials with partially ionic model in order to evaluate the thermal conductivity of zirconia-based inert matrix fuel (IMF). The thermal conductivity was calculated at the equilibrium condition based on Green-Kubo theory and phenomenological equations. For ErxYyMzZr1-x-y-zO2-(x+ y)/2 (where M = Ce or Pu), the thermal conductivity decreased with increase of y because of the presence of oxygen vacancies as the thermal resistance. It also slightly decreased with increase of z and temperature. However, significant difference could not be found in the thermal conductivity between Ce- and Pu-doped zirconia. The MD thermal conductivity of IMF was in good agreement with the literature data. Concerning the phenomenological coefficients, the cross-coupling effect between energy and charge fluxes was clearly observed at low z value and high temperatures for such zirconia systems.

The motivation of this work is to develop an IMF with a thermal conductivity superior to that of the fuels based on yttria stabilized zirconia. The concept uses the MgO phase as an efficient heat conductor to increase thermal conductivity of the composite. In this paper ceramic fabrication and characterization by scanning electron microscopy, energy and wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy is discussed. Characterization shows that the ceramics consist of the two-phase matrix and PuO2-rich inclusions. The matrix is comprised of pure MgO phase and MgO-ZrO2-PuO2 solid solution. The PuO2-rich inclusion contained dissolved MgO and ZrO2. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Sarma, KH; Fourcade, J; Lee, SG; Solomon, AA				Sarma, KH; Fourcade, J; Lee, SG; Solomon, AA			New processing methods to produce silicon carbide and beryllium oxide inert matrix and enhanced thermal conductivity oxide fuels	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Nuclear Materials held at the 2005 Spring Meeting of the European-Materials-Research-Society	MAY 31-JUN 02, 2005	Strasbourg, FRANCE	European Materials Res Soc			REACTOR	For inert matrix fuels, SiC and BeO represent two possible matrix phase compounds that exhibit very high thermal conductivity, high melting points, low neutron absorption, and reasonably high radiation stability. BeO is chemically compatible with UO2, PuO2, and Zircaloy to very high temperatures, but SiC reacts with all three at somewhat lower temperatures. We have developed the Polymer Impregnation and Pyrolysis or PIP method, making use of a commercial SiC polymeric precursor, to consolidate both particulate fuels like 'TRISO' microsphere fuels, and to impregnate UO2 fuels with pure stoichiometric SiC to improve their thermal conductivity. This method was employed to fabricate Enhanced Conductivity Oxide fuels, or ECO fuels with 5-10 vol.% of the high conductivity phase, and with 50 vol.% for TRISO dispersion fuels. For ECO fuels, a new 'slug/bisque' method of fabricating the UO2 fuel granules was necessary to produce sintered fuel with open pore structures, allowing almost complete impregnation of the continuous SiC phase. The advantages of the PIP process are that it is a non-damaging consolidation process for particulates (TRU, UC or TRISO microspheres), forms a continuous, pure beta-SiC phase at temperatures as low as 1573 K, and allows the maximum in fissile atom density. However, several PIP impregnation cycles and high crystallization temperatures are necessary to obtain high thermal conductivity SiC. For producing IMF fuels using the PIP process, the fissile PuC and/or TRU actinides can be added in small concentrations along with SiC 'filler particles' and consolidated with the SiC precursor for either open or closed fuel cycles. For BeO, a second approach was developed for ECO fuels that involves a 'co-sintering' route to produce high density fuels with a continuous BeO phase of 5-10 vol.%. Special granulation and mixing techniques were developed, but only one normal sintering cycle is required. For BeO matrix IMF fuels, PuO2 granules and TRU actinides or YSZ granules containing actinides could be simply dry-mixed with BeO powder and co-sintered to produce a dispersed fuel form. Alternatively, the BeO could be granulated, and the PuO2 and/or TRU oxides would fill the interstices forming a continuous minor phase that could be recycled in closed fuel cycles. Some advantages and disadvantages of these matrices are discussed. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

For today's LWRs yttrium stabilised zirconia (YSZ) and other oxides like alumina, spinel or ceria have been proposed as inert matrix materials. By employing IMF, a larger fraction of plutonium can potentially be consumed in comparison with MOX fuels without breeding new plutonium. The aim of the presented study is to measure the general thermal behaviour of YSZ-based IMF under irradiation conditions similar to those in current LWRs in direct comparison to standard MOX fuel. Of particular interest are the fuel thermal conductivity (and its degradation with burnup), fission gas release (FGR), fuel densification and fuel swelling. A secondary aim is the direct comparison of the fuel performance between YSZ-based IMF and MOX fuel. The irradiation is performed under HBWR conditions and has reached an average assembly burnup of similar to 300 kW d cm-(3) until the end of 2004, which is equivalent to similar to 29 MW d kg(-1) for the MOX fuel.

The aim of this work is twofold: to study the impact of the addition of plutonium, Simulated with cerium, on the physico-mechanical properties of thoria and to investigate the possibility of synthesising ceramics employing simple fabrication routes. Th1-xCexO2 powders with ceria concentrations from 0 to 75% were synthesised by the co-precipitation method. The properties of the powders, such as thermal and crystallisation behaviour, were determined as a function of ceria content and calcination temperature. (Th,Ce)O-2 pellets containing up to 20% ceria were compacted from non-ground 675 K calcined powder using a double repressing method. The pellets have densities of up to 0.98 TD and a homogeneous surface with well-distributed pores.

Three fuels were prepared; a single phase fuel of yttria-stabilized zirconia containing UO2 (U-YSZ) and two particle-dispersed fuels of U-YSZ particles in spinel or corundum matrix. U-YSZ particle sizes were about 100-200 mu m. These fuels were irradiated in Japan Research Reactor No. 3 for about 280 days. Post-irradiation examinations such as visual inspection and gamma scanning were carried out. No significant appearance changes were observed. The swelling behavior of the fuel pellets was negligible for all fuels. Axial and radial distributions of typical fission products (FPs) were analyzed by gamma scanning. Cs moved partly to the gaps between the pellets and to the insulators. The distribution of Cs-134 was different from that of Cs-137, especially for corundum-based fuel. The single phase fuel of U-YSZ showed great retention of Cs-137. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two main versions of IMF are under development at A.A. Bochvar Institute, i.e. heterogeneous or isolated distribution of plutonium. The out-of-pile results on IMF loaded with uranium dioxide as plutonium simulator are presented. Fuel elements with uranium dioxide composition fabricated at A.A. Bochvar Institute are currently under MIR tests (RIAR, Dimitrovgrad). The fuel elements reached a burn-up of 88 MW d kg(-1) (equivalent to the burn up of the standard uranium dioxide pelletized fuel) without loss of leak-tightness of the cladding.

To this end calculations with the Monte Carlo transport code MCNPX were performed. A maximum scenario and more realistic simple cylindrical geometries were calculated. They show that even with moderate accelerator parameters (approx. 300 MeV, 1-2 mA) a sensitive production of 0.5 kg Pu-239 per year available beam time can be obtained by simply bombarding uranium with protons. Even better designs are conceivable. These calculations were supplemented with the investigation of more realistic production scenarios, some of which were calculated in more detail.

Due to the interaction of the particle beams with matter, the accelerator components and the surroundings become activated and shall be treated as radioactive waste once the end of their operational lifetime is reached. For disposal towards the final repositories the radioactive waste legislation of both CERN Host-States requires the knowledge of the radionuclide inventory. This paper discusses the studies that are carried out at CERN for the characterization of the metallic radioactive waste produced every year in the several high-energy accelerators. The radionuclide inventory as well as the specific activity of radioactive waste originating from accelerators varies depending on the accelerated beam, on the location of the material with respect to the beam losses and the decay time already elapsed. The approach proposed at CERN is based on an estimate of the specific activity per radionuclide with the Monte-Carlo code FLUKA, by simulating the radiation environment to which the radioactive waste was exposed during its operational lifetime. This method has been validated for the CERN ISOLDE facility by both gamma-spectrometry and Monte-Carlo simulation of the target. The use of this method in those cases where the irradiation conditions are not known with sufficient precision requires careful extrapolation based on additional dose-rate and gamma-spectrometry measurements.

An external neutron source was introduced in a lead buffer zone located at the centre of the reactor core in order to simulate the spallation source. This paper deals with the GENEPI accelerator operation feedback at the MASURCA reactor facility during the MUSE-4 experimental campaign. After a presentation of the MASURCA mock-up facility and of the experimental programme objectives, the different phases of the accelerator design and realization are detailed. Its installation in the MASURCA nuclear facility, achieved in June 2000, is described concerning the technical and administrative topics. Then, the accelerator operation feedback is given concerning maintenance, tritium target management, source monitoring, technical evolutions, etc. The accelerator partial dismantling, achieved in the first part of 2005, is also presented. In addition, the GENEPI contribution to the MUSE-4 programme is presented in terms of experimental results and experimental measurement method improvements. Also, GENEPI 2, an evolution of the GENEPI concept, is described. This accelerator, is coupled to the PEREN facility which is dedicated to the nuclear cross-section measurements. Last, this paper makes a synthesis of the GENEPI operation feedback at the MASURCA facility and proposes recommendations for future projects involving accelerators used in nuclear reactor environment.

J	Stanculescu, A				Stanculescu, A			IAEA activities in the area of partitioning and transmutation	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Accelerator Applications	AUG 28-SEP 01, 2005	Venice, ITALY			partitioning and transmutation; accelerator-driven systems; international collaboration; IAEA coordinated research project		Four major challenges are facing the long-term development of nuclear energy: improvement of the economic competitiveness, meeting increasingly stringent safety requirements, adhering to the criteria of sustainable development, and public acceptance. Meeting the sustainability criteria is the driving force behind the topic of this paper. In this context, sustainability has two aspects: natural resources and waste management. IAEA's activities in the area of Partitioning and Transmutation (P&T) are mostly in response to the latter. While not involving the large quantities of gaseous products and toxic solid wastes associated with fossil fuels, radioactive waste disposal is today's dominant public acceptance issue. In fact, small waste quantities permit a rigorous confinement strategy, and mined geological disposal is the strategy followed by some countries. Nevertheless, political opposition arguing that this does not yet constitute a safe disposal technology has largely stalled these efforts. One of the primary reasons cited is the long life of many of the radioisotopes generated from fission. This concern has led to increased R&D efforts to develop a technology aimed at reducing the amount and radio-toxicity of long-lived radioactive waste through transmutation in fission reactors or sub-critical systems. In the frame of the Project on Technology Advances in Fast Reactors and Accelerator-Driven Systems (ADS), the IAEA initiated a number of activities on utilization of plutonium and transmutation of long-lived radioactive waste, ADS, and deuterium-tritium plasma-driven sub-critical systems. The paper presents past accomplishments, current status and planned activities of this IAEA project. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Soliton reactors and "candle reactors" have been proposed in order to use reactors for very long periods without reprocessing or enrichment. In this paper, we present the concept of hybrid soliton reactor. In this system, the constant displacement of the beam during the 30 years lifetime implies lower constraints on the window compared to other accelerator-driven systems. During its lifetime, the reactor can present constant profiles in chemical and isotopic composition and in power production if the beam of protons is maintained within certain limits. This is the soliton-like behavior. Using a mathematical analysis of the problem, we have shown that the solution of the equations presents a solitary wave behavior which is stable if the accelerator intensity is sufficiently low or if the velocity of the neutron source is sufficiently high. We have simulated these two behaviors with a GEANT III Monte Carlo program: a soliton behavior, and a one which may become unstable when the intensity is too large or the velocity too small. These preliminary considerations allow us to describe some specifications concerning an accelerator which can drive such a system. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The safety analysis shows that oxide cermet fuels with molybdenum matrix may hold an advantage over the alternatives in terms of a high margin to melt. Oxide cercer fuels based on MgO are more easily fabricated, but should be operated at low linear rating and deep sub-criticality to ensure sufficient safety margins. Nitride fuels with liquid metal bond appear to provide better in pile performance, but are complicated to fabricate. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The reference scenario corresponds to a medium size nuclear power country, with 10 light water reactors (LWRs). The study addresses long-term, equilibrium fuel cycle scenarios, with and without plutonium recycling (MOX) in LWRs and transuranics (TRU) burning in accelerator-driven systems (ADS). However, also short-term phase-out scenarios, including TRU burning in ADS, are performed. The equilibrium simulation showed that four ADS units, each of 800 MWt, are sufficient to burn an amount of plutonium and americium corresponding to the build-up of those elements. The phase-out simulation of a country adopting an approach to reduce the spent nuclear fuel inventory, showed that complementary burning of TRU in three to four ADS units appear suitable. The fuel cycle simulations have been performed using the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Simulation (NFCSim) code [C.G. Bathke, E.A. Schneider, NFCSim User's Manual, Los Alamos National Laboratory Report LA-UR-04-8369, 2004.] and the Monteburns code [D.I. Poston, H.R.

The maximum energy will be 50 Mev with a maximum average intensity of 10 mu A. It will be used for photofission in UCx targets. With the same target as that already used on the PARRNE set up it will be possible using ALTO to induce up to 10(11) fissions/s instead of 10(9) previously obtained with the 26 MeV/1 mu A deuteron beam. Several ion sources will be adapted on the set up: ISOLDE FEBIAD type, surface ionization, laser,.... Moreover the electron beam could be used for other applications. Calculation about fission, energy deposition and dose rate will be presented, as well as the target ion source adaptation on the PARRNE facility. For the SPIRAL 2 project planned at GANIL for 2008, the fission of U-238 in uranium carbide target will be induced by a neutron flow created by bombarding a carbon converter with a 40 MeV high intensity deuteron beam. The target has been designed to reach more than 1013 fissions/s with a good release time. Calculation and technical considerations used to optimize the target design are detailed. One of main difficulties for this target is to maintain it at high temperature (more than 2000 degrees C) during 3 months. A tantalum oven has been studied and a prototype is under test at IPN Orsay. Some R&D studies on a high density target are in progress in collaboration with PNPI Gatchina and INFN Legnaro. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The idea was to extract a beam of medium-energy protons or deuterons from the TESLA accelerator installation, and to transport and inject it into the reactor. The reactor core was to be composed of the highly enriched uranium fuel elements. The reactor was designated as ADSRR-H. Since the use of this type of fuel elements was not recommended any more, the study of a small accelerator-driven subcritical research reactor employing the low-enriched uranium fuel elements began in 2004. The reactor was designated as ADSRR-L. We compare here the results of the initial computer simulations of ADSRR-H and ADSRR-L. The results have confirmed that our concept could be the basis for designing and construction of a low neutron flux model of the proposed accelerator-driven subcritical power reactor to be moderated and cooled by lead. Our objective is to study the physics and technologies necessary to design and construct ADSRR-L. The reactor would be used for development of nuclear techniques and technologies, and for basic and applied research in neutron physics, metrology, radiation protection and radiobiology.

J	Neuhausen, J				Neuhausen, J			Investigations on the release of mercury from liquid eutectic lead-bismuth alloy under different gas atmospheres	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Accelerator Applications	AUG 28-SEP 01, 2005	Venice, ITALY			release; volatiles; liquid metal; spallation targets; LBE; lead-bismuth eutecticum		Eutectic lead-bismuth alloy (LBE) samples with mercury concentrations similar to those expected for a liquid metal spallation target were prepared. The release of mercury from these samples under a continuous flow of gas was studied as a function of temperature, using gamma-spectroscopy and Hg-203 as a radioactive tracer. Various gas compositions ranging from a reducing atmosphere (Ar/7%H-2) to oxidising conditions (moist air) were applied. Under reducing conditions, substantial release of mercury from LBE started at temperatures around 473 K. At about 571 K, half of the mercury present in the samples was released within I h. Oxidising conditions led to a strong decrease in mercury release. In 1 h-experiments, no release of mercury was observed for temperatures up to 935 K within the limits of experimental error when humid air was used as a carrier gas. Apparently, the formation of an oxide layer on the surface of the melt inhibits the evaporation of Hg. This effect is of importance with respect to accident scenarios in liquid metal spallation targets, where liquid LBE could be exposed to air as well as cooling water. In such a case, a substantial decrease in the evaporation rate of mercury can be expected due to the formation of an oxide layer. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is motivated by a number of different applications where progress in reliable and, in some cases, very high-intensity electron accelerators was awaited. In particular, today's interest is linked to the nuclear material interrogation and non-destructive nuclear waste characterization, both based either on prompt neutron, or delayed neutron, or delayed gamma detection following photofission. The knowledge of photonuclear reactions is also extremely important in the design of electron accelerators used for medical applications, nuclear physics, photoneutron sources, radioactive ion beam production, etc. In this paper we present the photonuclear activation file (PAF) under development to be included into any material depletion code. By now the PAF contains the photonuclear cross-sections for more than 600 isotopes, fission fragment distributions and delayed neutron evaluations for most of the actinides in the photon energy range from 0 up to 25 MeV. Theoretical predictions, evaluated data files and available experimental data were used to construct the PAF, and some benchmarks are in progress to ensure its quality. The release of the first version of PAF is planned in 2006. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In experiments cylindrical Pb targets were exposed to the beam of 660 MeV protons. Using gamma-spectrometry, a number of radionuclides were identified in Pb and Bi samples irradiated in the targets. Axial and radial distributions of several nuclides production rates were determined. Three types of the distribution shapes were distinguished: Bi isotopes, medium and heavier nuclides. The distributions of Bi isotopes reveal a sharp characteristic peak about 30cm inside the target. The comparison of experimental results with calculations (MCNPX, FLUKA and LAHET) shows agreement within one order of magnitude, at the worst. Almost always the C/E ratio is between 3 and 1/3. However, no single code and/or reaction model yields good results for all examined nuclides. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The induced specific activities of radionuclides, as measured with gamma spectrometry, then served as benchmark of the FLUKA Monte Carlo code. A careful analysis of the experimental data as well as of the reactions leading to the various isotopes in the simulation demonstrated that FLUKA is capable of predicting individual isotopes with an uncertainty of less than 20-30% in most cases. Due to the universal nature of the high energy interaction models the results also serve as indirect validation of FLUKA predictions for target materials, reactions and isotopes not covered by this study.

KIPT has a plan to construct an accelerator-driven sub-critical assembly targeted towards the medical isotope production and the support of the Ukraine nuclear industry. The external neutron source is produced either through photonuclear reactions in tungsten or uranium targets, or deuteron reactions in a beryllium target. KIPT intends using the high-enriched uranium (HEU) for the fuel of the sub-critical assembly. The main objective of this paper is to study the possibility of utilizing low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel instead of HEU fuel without penalizing the sub-critical assembly performance, in particular the neutron flux level. In the course of this activity, several studies have been carried out to investigate the main choices for the system's parameters. The external neutron source has been characterized and a pre-conceptual target design has been developed. Several sub-critical configurations with different fuel enrichments and densities have been considered. Based on our analysis, it was shown that the performance of the LEU fuel is comparable with that of the HEU fuel. The LEU fuel sub-critical assembly with 200-MeV electron energy and 100-kW electron beam power has an average total flux of similar to 2.50 x 10(13) n/s cm(2) in the irradiation channels. The corresponding total facility power is similar to 204 kW divided into 91 and 113 kW deposited in the target and sub-critical assemblies, respectively. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The main functions of the facility are the medical isotope production and the support of the Ukraine nuclear industry. An electron accelerator is considered to drive the subcritical assembly. The neutron source intensity and spectrum have been studied. The energy deposition, spatial neutron generation, neutron utilization fraction, and target dimensions have been quantified to define the main target performance parameters, and to select the target material and beam parameters. Different target conceptual designs have been developed based the engineering requirements including heat transfer, thermal hydraulics, structure, and material issues. The subcritical assembly is designed to obtain the highest possible neutron flux level with a K-eff of 0.98. Different fuel materials, uranium enrichments, and reflector materials are considered in the design process. The possibility of using low enrichment uranium without penalizing the facility performance is carefully evaluated. The mechanical design of the facility has been developed to maximize its utility and minimize the time for replacing the target and the fuel assemblies. Safety, reliability, and environmental considerations are included in the facility conceptual design. The facility is configured to accommodate future design improvements, upgrades, and new missions. In addition, it has large design margins to accommodate different operating conditions and parameters. In this paper, the conceptual design and the design analyses of the facility will be presented.

Different levels of subcriticality have been measured using the MSA (Modified Source Approximated) method by the insertion of a standard fixed radioactive source into different core positions. Starting from a reference configuration, fuel elements were removed: control rods were moved outward as required for the coupling experiments envisioned with the proton accelerator and fission chambers were inserted in order to measure subcritical count rates. A neutron-physics analysis based on the modified formulation of the source multiplication method (MSM) has been carried out, which requires the systematic solution for each experimental configuration of the homogeneous, both in the forward and adjoint forms, and inhomogeneous Boltzmann equations. By means of such a methodology calculated correction factors to be applied to the MSA measured reactivities were produced in order to take into account spatial and energetic effects creating changes in the detector efficiencies and effective source with respect to the calibration configuration. The methodology presented has been tested against a large number of experimental states. The measurements have underlined the sensitivity of the MSA measured reactivities to core geometry changes and control rod perturbations; the efficiency of MSM factors to dramatically correct for this sensitivity is underlined, making of this technique a relevant methodology in view of the incoming US RACE program to be performed in TRIGA reactors.

The mix of oxides PuO2 + UO2 MOX fuel designed for the reactor will be adopted for the core of the assembly. The design of the experimental subcritical assembly in Dubna (SAD) is based on the core with a nominal unit capacity of 30 kW (thermal). This corresponds to the multiplication coefficient K-eff = 0.95 and the accelerator beam power of I kW. A subcritical assembly has been modeled in order to increase power of this experimental set up.

High beam power-400 kW-will allow RIA to become the most powerful rare isotope beam facility in the world; however, it also creates challenges for the design of the isotope-production targets. This paper focuses on the isotope-separator-on-line (ISOL) target work, particularly the radiation transport aspects of the two-step fission target design. Simulations were performed with the PHITS, MCNPX, and MARS15 computer codes. A two-step ISOL target considered here consists of a mercury or tungsten primary target in which primary beam interactions release neutrons, which in turn induce fissions-and produce rare isotopes-in the secondary target filled with fissionable material. Three primary beams were considered: 1-GeV protons, 622-MeV/u deuterons, and 777-MeV/u He-3 ions. The proton and deuterium beams were found to be about equivalent in terms of induced fission rates and heating rates in the target, while the 3 He beam, without optimizing the target geometry, was less favorable, producing about 15% fewer fissions and about 50% higher heating rates than the proton beam at the same beam power.

Total power is in the order of 10-100 kW. Generally, the geometric size of the targets is very small so the heat flux is high. The design of these targets requires efficient heat removal techniques in order to preserve the integrity of the target. The average heat fluxes from these targets can be up to 1 kW/cm(2). Few techniques exist to deal with such high heat fluxes. One of them is mini- or micro-channels heat exchanger. In order to evaluate the performance of mini- and micro-channels heat exchangers for high heat flux cooling, experimental cooling loop has been designed and built at Soreq. Initial experiments have been preformed. These experiments demonstrated a cooling capacity over 1 kW/cm(2). This cooling capacity can be obtained with relatively little cost as compared to results of earlier studies. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Today LANSCE continues operation as one of the most versatile accelerator-based user facilities in the world. During eight months of annual operation, scientists from around the world work at LANSCE to execute an extraordinarily broad program of defense and civilian research. Several areas operate simultaneously. The Lujan Neutron Scattering Center (Lujan Center) is a moderated spallation source (meV to keV), the Weapons Neutron Research Facility (WNR) is a bare spallation neutron source (keV to 800MeV), and a new ultra-cold neutron source will be operational in 2005. These sources give LANSCE the ability to produce and use neutrons with energies that range over 14 orders of magnitude. LANSCE also supplies beam to WNR and two other areas for applications requiring protons. In a proton radiography (pRad) area, a sequence of narrow proton pulses is transmitted through shocked materials and imaged to study dynamic properties. In 2005, LANSCE began operating a facility that uses 100-MeV protons to produce medical radioisotopes. To sustain a vigorous program beyond this decade, LANSCE has embarked on a project to refurbish key elements of the facility and to plan capabilities beyond those that presently exist.

This paper estimates the expected amount of induced radioactivity in the various components of the target-solenoid assembly of the experiment to be carried out at the 24 GeV CERN proton synchrotron. The total activity expected in the mercury target and the specific activities in the components of the solenoid are assessed by Monte Carlo simulations with the FLUKA code. The residual dose rates for various decay times after the end of the irradiation are calculated. The environmental impact of the release of the activated nitrogen used to cool the solenoid is evaluated. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

A first estimate of the required shielding was obtained by means of a simple analytical model. The source terms and the attenuation lengths used in the present study were calculated with the Monte Carlo cascade code FLUKA. Detailed FLUKA simulations were performed to investigate the contribution of neutron skyshine and backscattering to the expected dose rate in the areas around the linac tunnel. An estimate of the induced radioactivity in the magnets, vacuum chamber, the cooling system and the concrete shield was performed. A preliminary thermal study of the beam dump is also discussed.

For this reason, the induced radioactivity of the different water circuits is calculated using the Monte-Carlo (MC) code FLUKA. The results lead to the definition of procedures to be taken into account during the repair and maintenance of the machine, as well as to measures being necessary for a release of water into the environment. In order to assess the validity of the applied methods, a benchmark experiment was carried out at the CERN-EU High Energy Reference Field (CERF) facility, where a hadron beam (120 GeV) is impinging on a copper target. Four samples of water, as used at the LHC, and different in their chemical compositions, were irradiated near the copper target. In addition to the tritium activity measured with a liquid scintillation counter, the samples were also analyzed using gamma spectroscopy in order to determine the activity of the gamma emitting isotopes such as Be-7 and Na-24. While for the latter an excellent agreement between simulation and measurement was found, for the calculation of tritium a correction factor is derived to be applied for future LHC calculations in which the activity is calculated by direct scoring of produced nuclei. A simplified geometry representing the LHC Arc sections is then used to evaluate the different calculation methods with FLUKA. By comparing these methods and by taking into account the benchmark results, a strategy for the environmental calculations can be defined. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

There, detectors will detect those neutrinos and try to disentangle those, which on their 730 km trip have changed their flavour. During the operating lifetime of the neutrino beam facility some interventions are required. These maintenance operations have to be planned in advance to define the guidelines of design and operational procedures in order to keep the doses received by personnel As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA-principle). A calculational method developed for the Monte Carlo simulation program FLUKA has been used, which allows one to compute dose equivalent rates from induced radioactivity for different cooling times in the regions of the human intervention. In this paper the method of calculation is described, the results of dose equivalent rate in the areas of interventions are summarized and discussed and finally, these results are applied to estimate doses received by personnel during interventions.

The two cleaning insertions (IR3 and IR7) housing the collimators will be among the most radioactive areas of LHC. The 1.5 km long IR7 insertion was fully implemented with the Monte Carlo cascade code FLUKA. Extensive simulations were performed to estimate the radiation level along the tunnel, as well as the energy deposition in the most critical elements. In particular, this paper discusses the latest results of the FLUKA studies, including the design of passive absorbers (to protect warm magnets) and a comparison of W and Cu as material for the active absorber jaws (to protect cold magnets). Any electronic device operating in strong radiation fields such as those expected for the LHC tunnel will undergo degradation. A shielding study was done to reduce radiation damage to the electronics. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The main characteristics of the subcritical core are: MOX fuel, k(eff) = 0.95, fission power 27.6 kW, Pb reflector. The SAD spallation target consists of one central and 18 hexagonal (36 mm pitch) Pb prisms in 2 concentric layers. The main goal of the calculations, the results of which are presented, is the evaluation of the target total induced radioactivity and of its longitudinal and radial distributions in the target. The time evolution for several working scenarios of the total and long-lived isotopes activity are shown as well. The computational tools applied are the MCNPX2.5e code for high-energy particles and FISPACT for low energy ones. The results obtained with some selected nuclear reaction models in the MCNPX calculations are compared. Calculated results of activities for long-lived isotopes produced by the high energy particles are confronted with the measured ones, obtained in the experiment with bare Pb cylindrical target.

The 7 Mev injector can be used in three operating modes: Protontherapy and Radiobiology Mode-injecting low current proton beam into the TOP linac accelerating sections; Radioisotope Mode-generating an intense proton beam (8-10 mA, 50-100 mu s, 30-100 Hz) to produce the positron-emitting radionuclide F18 for PET analyses. In the high current mode, at the exit of the injector the beam is guided through a magnetic quadrupoles channel to a target composed by a thin chamber (0.5 mm thick and I in. diameter) containing water enriched with O18. Production yield as well as total activity similar to these achieved with higher energy cyclotrons have been obtained. Environmental doses measured give indications on the shielding required for operation under current radioprotection regulations. Improvements are foreseen to optimize the production yield, the useful beam current and to better characterize gamma and neutron dose rates in the different operational modes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

So far radioisotope activities of only a few microcuries have been obtained from single discharges in small scale Plasma Focus machines (capacitor bank energies of approximately 7 kJ). It is expected that higher activities could be obtained with larger bank energies, operating at high pulse repetition rates, e.g. 1 Hz. However, many scientific and technological issues must be addressed for a high-energy Plasma Focus device to run at one pulse per second. Aim of this paper is to present preliminary results pertaining to the plasma, electrical, fluid-dynamical, thermal, material and mechanical design of a 150kJ Plasma Focus, capable of a repetition rate of 1 Hz, that will be operated at 30 kV with a 350 mu F capacitor bank and a maximum total current of 1.5 MA. This device will be used to breed 18-F for the synthesis of drugs used in positron-emission medical examinations, such as FDG for PET. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Since the beginning of 1990s, our team in CEA has been working on the development of a method based on interrogation with high-energy photons to assay actinides in large concrete waste package. The method consists in using photons of high energy (bremsstrahlung radiation) in order to induce photofission reactions on the fissile nuclei present in the wastes. The measurement of the delayed neutrons emitted by fission products allows us to quantify the actinides present in the wastes. The accuracy of the method can be deeply improved by carrying out a tomography, i.e. computing the three-dimensional spatial distribution of the actinide mass inside the nuclear waste package. This paper presents the first experimental results of a tomography carried out on a 1.2t real concrete waste package. Measurements associated with reconstruction algorithms and Monte Carlo simulations have allowed to locate an equivalent mass of 690 mg of uranium 238 centered in a disc of 20-25 cm of diameter at 75 cm height. These measurements have been performed in the SAPHIR irradiation facility at CEA/Saclay. This facility houses a pulsed linear electron accelerator (energy range from 15 to 30 MeV, pulse duration of 2.5 Vs, peak current of 130 mA). The located mass has been subsequently confirmed by a destructive analysis of the package. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Minerals as Time-Integrating Luminescence Detectors for setting bounds on dark matter particle characteristics	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Time-Integrating Luminescence method; TL/OSL dosimetry; axions; WIMPs; retrospective dosimetry; dark matter	DOUBLE-BETA DECAY; SOLAR AXIONS; RETROSPECTIVE DOSIMETRY; STIMULATED LUMINESCENCE; SEARCH; FELDSPARS; SUPERSYMMETRY; CANDIDATES; EMISSION; PHYSICS	Terrestrial material, since its formation, is supposed to receive additional radiation dose from its exposure to fluxes of dark matter particles. The present work investigates the possibility for bound estimation of interaction parameters of dark matter particles with ordinary matter, by measuring the accumulated doses of certain geological materials. It is proposed that Thermoluminescence (TL) and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) could enable the differentiation between the individual dose components, attributing a possible excessive dose, beyond the anticipated from cosmic rays and environmental radioactivity, to interactions with dark matter particles. Dosimetric properties of natural calcium fluoride, such as low detectable dose limit and low energy threshold (well below 1 keV), indicate it as a promising Thermoluminescent Dosimeter (TLD) for the proposed method. The limitations imposed by the "background" of cosmic rays and environmental radioactivity are discussed, and initial limits for the interaction strengths with ordinary matter, and/or the mass of WIMPs and axions are derived. The use of sedimentary quartz, sited in a free-from background-radiation environment, would yield a value of 4 x 10(-8) GeV-1 as an upper limit for the axion-to-photon interaction constant g(a gamma gamma) and a value of 3 x 10(-8) GeV as a lower limit for the neutralino mass. The best limits, g(a gamma gamma) = 1.1 x 10(-10) GeV-1 for solar axions and m = 3000 GeV for neutralinos, could be derived for natural calcium fluoride as a dosimeter. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This report sets forth a characterization of the baseline suppression effect in gross-count gamma-ray profiles due to shadow shielding by vehicles entering RPMs. Shadow shielding is of interest because it reduces the alarm sensitivity of RPMs. This observational study investigated three types of PVT-based commercial RPM systems currently deployed at selected ports of entry in terms of spatial effects relative to detector panel positioning. Radiation portal monitor sites were characterized by driver versus passenger side, top versus bottom panel, and narrow lanes versus wide lanes as observed for a large number of vehicles. Each portal site appears to have a distinctive baseline suppression signature, based on percent maximum suppression relative to measured background. Results suggest that alarm algorithms based on gross-counts may be further refined through attention to individual site characteristics. In addition, longer vehicle transit times were often correlated with stronger baseline suppression, suggesting that baseline suppression studies should take transit time into account.

It involves tracking a single radioactively labelled tracer particle. The tracking efficiency and representative of PEPT data are crucially dependent on the amount of radioactivity labelled in a single particle, as well as the physical and chemical properties of a tracer. This paper will discuss the effect of tracer properties on PEPT data and two labelling techniques, direct activation and ion-exchange, in detail. In direct activation, particles are directly bombarded using a 33 MeV He-3 beam. A few of the oxygen atoms in the particles are then converted into F-18 radioisotope. Direct activation can be used to label a particle with a size range from 1 to 10 mm, but the material must be able to resist a high temperature. The ion-exchange technique can be used to label smaller resin particles with a size ranging from 60 to 1000 mu m.

Reactivity and neutron emission measurements of highly burnt PWR fuel rod samples	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								Fuel rods with burnup values beyond 50 GWd/t are characterised by relatively large amounts of fission products and a high abundance of major and minor actinides. Of particular interest is the change in the reactivity of the fuel as a function of burnup, and the capability of modern codes to predict this change. In addition, the neutron emission from burnt fuel has important implications for the design of transport and storage facilities. Measurements have been made of the reactivity effects and the neutron emission rates of highly-burnt uranium oxide and mixed oxide fuel rod samples coming from a pressurised water reactor (PWR). The reactivity measurements have been made in a PWR lattice in the PROTEUS zero-energy reactor moderated in turn with: water, a water and heavy water mixture and water containing boron. A combined transport flask and sample changer was used to insert the 400 nun long burnt fuel rod segments into the reactor. Both control rod compensation and reactor period methods were used to determine the reactivities of the samples. For the range of burnup values investigated, an interesting exponential relationship has been found between the neutron emission rate and the measured reactivity. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
