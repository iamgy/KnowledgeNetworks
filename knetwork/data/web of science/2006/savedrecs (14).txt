High-resolution mass spectrometry is generally accepted as an accurate technique for determining this ratio, but this is a very costly method. Alternatives to this method are alpha- and gamma-spectrometry studies but the problem with these low-cost method lies with the analysis of the spectrum. Recently, Noy et al. [2004. Nucl. Instrum. Methods in Phys. Res. A 525, 522-528] developed a computer program code called WinALPHA to quantitatively analyze the alpha spectrum; the program is available from the IAEA website. In this paper, we report the results obtained from the analysis of the alpha spectrum of plutonium from power bearing product samples from power reactor fuel reprocessing plant using the WinALPHA program. The results are found to be in good agreement (within 1-2%) with results from mass spectrometry. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nuclear power plant site lifetime	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The interrelationship between the life cycle of a power-generating unit of a nuclear power plant and the life cycle of the plant site is examined. It is shown that the work performed at the final stage of the life cycle of a power-generating unit must be mutually coordinated with the life cycle of the site and the industry. This work is best viewed as a new investment project organized along the appropriate modern lines. It is recommended that the handling of the radioactive materials produced at all stages of the life cycle of the power-generating unit of a nuclear power plant and the optimal use of the plant site be studied from a different viewpoint - minimizing the cost of storing radioactive materials by converting a substantial portion of these materials into reusable industrial wastes.

Reactor with a fast-resonance neutron spectrum, cooled by supercritical-pressure water with a bidirectional coolant flow scheme	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								A scheme for circulating coolant and cooling the core that has advantages over the designs of similar nuclear power systems is proposed for light-water reactors with supercritical coolant parameters and a fast-resonance neutron spectrum. A negative void coefficient of reactivity is obtained for the entire run. of a,fuel assembly without building a blanket. A more uniform distribution, of the energy release over the core volume is achieved without using cornplicated fuel-enrichment schemes. The nonuniformity of the coolant temperature distribution at the core exit is decreased. The fuel assemblies operate with a much lower temperature drop over the core height. The core has a small reactivity excess on burnup and a BR of about 7, for which the most difficult operating regimes (flooding with cold water) can be handled with standard means (placement of absorbing organs of the safety and control system in similar to 2/3 of the fuel assemblies).

Ultraphosphate glasses for immobilization of liquid plutonium-containing wastes	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								Ultraphosphate glass is proposed for immobilization, taking account of the composition of the plutonium-containing wastes at the Mining-Chemical conglomerate. Some parameters of the process of immobilizing in ultraphosphate glass model wastes with plutonium content up to 150 mg/liter are investigated. A preliminary study is made of the degree of inclusion of plutonium dioxide, the chemical stability of the ultraphosphate glass obtained, and the distribution of plutonium in it. It is shown that almost 2 times more plutonium dioxide is included in ultraphosphate glass than in phosphate glass. With respect to the main physicochemical parameters, specifically, component leachability, ultraphosphate glass can. be regarded as promising for immobilizing liquid plutonium-containing wastes.

Sr-89 production in a reactor with solution fuel	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The experimental results for the validation of a technology for producing Sr-89 in a reactor with solution fuel are presented. The aggregate state of the fuel - a water solution. of uranyl sulfate UO2SO4 - opens up a unique possibility of acting not only on. the target radionuclide but also on its genetic precursors, produced as a result of nuclear transformations of the fission products as a whole in the decay chain Se-89 -> Br-89 -> Kr-89 -> Rb-89 -> Sr-89 The half-life of Kr-89 (T-1/2 = 190 sec) - a gaseous precursor of Sr-89 - is sufficient for it to leave the fuel solution and migrate into the gaseous medium. A series of experiments is performed on obtaining gas samples from the free volume of the solution of the 20 kW Argus minireactor. It is shown that the mechanism of delivery of Sr-89 into the sorption volume of the experimental loop of the Argus reactor system is based on transport along the Kr-89 loop. Measurements of the content of the radioactive impurities in a solution of (SrCl2)-Sr-89 showed that the purification of the gas flow by metal-ceramic filters and purification, of the solution. on DOWEX-50x8 or crown ehter Sr-Resin yields medical quality Sr-89. The productivity of the new technology, which is many fold greater than that of the modern industrial methods for producing Sr-89; is assessed on the basis of experimental data.

J	Ohnemus, J				Ohnemus, J			Uranium, a factor limiting nuclear energy?	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								Nuclear power has been back as a topic of public debate since early this year. A special subject under discussion is the extension of nuclear power plant life. Hardly had it been on the agenda, when interested par-ties announced that this step was impossible because uranium reserves were no longer sufficient. A variety of terms are being used in this discussion without their meaning being taken into account: stocks, resources, and reserves. To clarify the situation, this article outlines important aspects of short and long term uranium supplies, and analyzes their meaning. Here are some of the most important issues under consideration: For what period of time is there really enough uranium? Is uranium becoming the limiting factor in the use of nuclear power? Is uranium really a "sustainable" energy resource? Will higher prices extend the range? What is the influence of the price of uranium on the cost of electricity generation? Among other results, it is found that comprehensive sources of low-price uranium and nuclear fuels are, or can be made, available worldwide. Consequently, the "range" is beyond the time frames currently mentioned, also as a function of technological factors, i.e. reaching several hundred years. It is also important to note that nuclear power ensures greater independence of volatile imported sources, guarantees reliably low electricity prices, has a huge potential of environmental protection, and is a clean source of energy.

The research reactor TRIGA Mainz	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article								The TRIGA Mark II reactor at the Institut fur Kernchemie became first critical on August 3(rd), 1965. It can be operated in the steady state mode with a maximum power of 100 kWth and in the pulse mode with a peak power of 250 MWth. A survey of the research programmes performed at the TRIGA Mainz is given covering applications in basic research as well as applied science in nuclear chemistry and nuclear physics. Furthermore, the reactor is used for neutron activation analysis and for education and training of scientists, teachers, students and technical personal. Important projects for the future of the TRIGA Mainz are the UCN (ultra cold neutrons) experiment, fast chemical separation, medical., : applications and the use of the NAA as well as the use of the reactor facility for the training of students in the fields of nuclear. chemistry, nuclear physics and radiation protection. Taking into account the past and future operation schedule and the typically low burn-up of TRIGA fuel elements (similar to 4 g U-235/a), the reactor can be operated for at least the next decade taking into account the fresh fuel elements on stock and without changing spent fuels.

J	Kaulard, J; Junger-Graf, B				Kaulard, J; Junger-Graf, B			Decommissioning the research reactors of the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg - Experience accumulated in "safe enclosure" and "direct disposal" as shown by the examples of the TRIGA HD I and TRIGA HD II reactors	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								Between 1966 and 1977 and 1978 and 1999, the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), in Heidelberg ran 2 TRIGA Mark I research reactors to produce radioisotopes for medical applications and for cancer therapy. In its approaches to decommissioning and disposal of the 2 reactors, the DKFZ at different points. in time carried out both "safe enclosure" and "direct disposal." The TRIGA HD I research reactor was put into "safe enclosure" following its last decommissioning phase in August 1977, and has been in the final stages of dismantling since January 2006. The TRIGA HD II research reactor, which was shut down in December 1999, has been in the direct demolition and disposal phases since September 2004. Decommissioning these 2 reactors of similar designs, and evaluating the information available about the 2 decommissioning projects, allows the two decommissioning options to be compared and their potential pros and cons to be worked out in the light of practical, albeit special, examples. The article presents some initial findings made in this comparison. It should be noted, however, that these results must not be generalized or translated directly to other decommissioning projects.

J	Kessler, G				Kessler, G			Analysis for a future proliferation resistant plutonium fuel cycle	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Workshop on Future Nuclear Systems and Fuel Cycles	SEP 01-02, 2005	Karlsruhe, GERMANY					After the International Fuel Cycle Evaluation Program around 1980-1982 the USA decided to give up reprocessing of spent LAIR fuel and refabrication of mixed oxide fuel as well as the use of MOX fuel in nuclear reactors. The USA decided as national nuclear waste policy to follow the direct spent fuel disposal. Germany also essentially followed the same waste policy for its fuel cycle just recently. Other countries, e.g. France, the UK or Japan did not follow this policy. In the USA there are in more recent times also discussions to keep the conditioned spent fuel elements retrievable from the geological disposal site to keep the possibility open for a later change of its fuel cycle policy. Research on actinide transmutation by recycling them in nuclear reactors is ongoing since about 10 years. Present IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) safeguards for reactor Pu and recycling of MOX fuel elements and the concern about the possible misuse of reactor Pu are certainly justified. Applying an conservative approach there exists a limit of 6-8% Pu-238 content for which the reactor Pu can be considered as "denatured". It is shown in a subsequent paper how such denatured reactor Pu can be generated by different options of the Pu fuel cycle and how such denatured Pu can be incinerated afterwards totally by multirecycling.

Depending on the kind of study, 2-D axi-symmetric or 3-D models are used for those numerical simulations with FLUENT. a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code. Results show the response of the hohlraum assembly and the DT ice layer profile to sinusoidal modulation of the temperature of the cooling rings. We have also calculated that no change in the DT ice was observed with variations up to +1/-2 mK on thermal shroud. Results of flux absorption during laser alignment are reported here. Taking in account the cavity real geometric configuration, the seven gas-areas cavity appears to be the most effective to counteract convection effects. Other ways to counteract those effects have been explored like heating modulation in the central area on the outer surface of the gold cavity, or uniform heating in this area with auxiliary heating on the lower cooling ring. More, the thermal response of DT ice when it is submitted to a quenching (in order to obtain the LMJ target gas density specification) is shown here.

The derivation of an analytical solution for the redistribution time in a one-dimensional binary diffusion model, which includes the thermal resistance of the capsule, is first described. This result shows that the redistribution time for a high conductivity capsule wall is approximately doubled after 8 days of (3) He formation. In contrast, with a low thermal conductivity capsule wall (e.g., polyimide), the redistribution time would increase by less than 10%. The substantial effect of the capsule wall resistance suggested that the resistance to heat transfer from the capsule through the surrounding transfer gas to the hohlraum wall would also influence the redistribution process. This was investigated with a spherical model, which was based on accounting for energy transfer by diffusion with a conduction heat. transfer approximation. This made it possible to solve for the continuous temperature distribution throughout the capsule and surrounding gas. As with the capsule the redistribution times depended on the relative values of the thermal resistances of the vapor in the capsule and the transfer gas. With increasing vapor thermal resistance (increased concentration of He-3) redistributions times for hydrocarbon capsules were less than the minimum one-dimensional value of 27 minutes. Further analytical and experimental investigation of the thermal interaction between the capsule and hohlraum is recommended.

Control of the first two Legendre modes of the fuel thickness perturbations using two infrared beams injected into a hohlraum was predicted by modeling and experimentally demonstrated In the current work, we use coupled ray tracing and heat transfer simulations to explore a wider range of control of long scale length asymmetries. We demonstrate several scenarios to control the first four Legendre modes in the fuel layer using four beams. With such a system, it appears possible to smooth both short and long scale length fuel thickness variations in transparent indirect drive inertial confinement fusion targets.

Three-dimensional characterization of cryogenic target ice layers using multiple shadowgraph views	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th Target Fabrication Specialists Meeting	MAY 01-05, 2005	Scottsdale, AZ				NATIONAL IGNITION FACILITY; SURFACE-ROUGHNESS; DEUTERIUM-TRITIUM; PERFORMANCE; CAPSULE; SHELLS	Backlit optical shadowgraphy is the primary diagnostic for D(2) ice layer characterization of cryogenic targets for the OMEGA Laser System at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics (LLE). Reflection and refraction of light passing through the ice layer produce characteristic rings. The position of the most prominent of the shadowgraph rings, known as the bright ring, can be resolved to similar to 0.1-pixel rms, corresponding to about 0.12 mu m for typical LLE target shadowgraphs. Measurement of the bright ring position in conjunction with ray-trace model predictions determines the ice layer thickness and the Fourier-mode spectrum of the ice roughness for that view. The LLE target characterization stations use two camera angles and target rotation to record target shadowgraphs from many different views. Combining these views allows construction of a 3-D ice layer representation, an estimation of the global surface roughness, and a determination of a Legendre-mode spectrum suitable for implosion modeling. The standard operating procedure is to construct a 3-D ice layer representation using the analysis of 48 separate shadowgraphic views. The 3-D ice surface is then decomposed in terms of spherical harmonics, allowing the determination of low-mode number (l <= 8 to 10) elements of a Legendre-mode power spectrum. Higher-mode number elements of the Legendre power spectrum are determined by mapping the Fourier-mode power spectrum averaged over all views.

In addition to high mechanical properties, polymer membranes must exhibit a high transparency in the infrared (IR) wavelengths range between 2.86 and 4 mu m (3500 and 2500 cm(-1)) to allow the IR assisted deuterium-tritium ice layer redistribution. Upilex (TM) type polyimides exhibit the desired mechanical properties but are not transparent in this wavelengths range due to the aromatic C-H stretching bands. In order to provide the required optical properties, the hydrogen atoms must be substituted by deuterium atoms. In the present contribution, we wish to report the first synthesis of a fully deuterated Upilex (TM) type polyimide. Optimized ways of synthesis. and purification for the two deuterated monomers 3,3',4,4'-biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride (BPDA-d6) and p-phenylene diamine (PDA-d4) have been developed. These monomers have been used to prepare deuterated poly(amic-acid) solutions in NMP Thermal treatment of films obtained from these solutions gives rise to deuterated Upilex type polyimide films. These films show a high transparency in the 2.86-4 mu m region. The synthesis and the characterization of this new deuterated polymer will be discussed.

On CEA Laser "Megajoule" (LMJ) facility, amorphous hydrogenated carbon (a-C:H or CHx) is the nominal ablator used to realize inertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiments. These capsules contain the fusible deuterium-tritium mixture to achieve ignition. Coatings are prepared by glow discharge polymerization (GDP) with trans-2-butene and hydrogen and can be easily doped with germanium adding tetramethylgermanium. Laser fusion targets must have optimized characteristics: diameter of 2.4 mm for LMJ targets, thickness up to 167.5 mu m, sphericity and thickness concentricity better than 99% and an outer and an inner roughness of a few nanometers at high modes. The surface finish of these laser fusion targets must be extremely smooth in order to minimize hydrodynamic instabilities. With GDP techniques, it is possible to obtain coatings without any growing structures and thus only with very small nodules at the Surface by controlling the coating parameters and having low deposition rates (lower than 0.5 mu m/h). This allows to obtain high mode roughness lower than 10 nm. Nevertheless, this is not sufficient to obtain LMJ specifications especially at intermediate modes which are strongly degraded by local defects ("bumps"). In order to eliminate mostly of these singular points that could be the source of the defects, etching during the film growth can be useful. In this work, we show how we reduced the roughness of germanium doped CHx microshells by adding helium in the plasma or pulsing hydrogen in order to have an exacerbated etching effect and also a higher surface temperature and thus a better mobility of the adsorbed species. By controlling these parameters, we obtained germanium doped CHx microshells compatible with the LMJ specifications. The RMS roughness from modes 10 to 1000 is lower than 20 nm and from modes 2 to 10 is around 160 nm. New designs of graded germanium doped microshells improve the stability of the target to hydrodynamic instabilities. This allows relaxing the specification of the roughness. The first microshells were synthesized and the results are presented in this paper.

Such targets can be used for experiments at Sandia's Z facility as well as at the National Ignition Facility (NIF). This permeation barrier has been shown to have a half-life (tau(1/2)) of similar to 2-4 weeks for a thickness of similar to 1.5 mu m. The sputter coating conditions have been successfully optimized to produce smooth uniform SiO2 coatings with enough integrity to allow routine handling as well as filling to the required pressures (20 atm). The key coating conditions investigated were the agitation mechanism and the coating pressure. We found that an agitation mechanism using gentle rolling produced coatings with a half-life of greater than three weeks, whereas a more vigorous bouncing agitation yielded half-lives of only a few days. Coating pressures of 2, 5, and 10 mTorr were studied and it was found that coatings at 5 mTorr produced coatings free of cracking. Since the sputtering is performed in a background atmosphere of argon, the sputtered SiO2 layer was found to contain trace amounts of argon as measured by x-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements. Our work has yielded a controllable uniform alternative permeation barrier to the traditionally used poly(vinylalcohol) (PVA).

These elements have been chosen to increase the hohlraum wall albedo, targeting the composition that results in the highest hohlraum efficiency. Rather than co-sputtering the cocktail constituents as was done previously, the approach taken in this work is to sputter alternating multiple thin layers of DU and gold. The intended outcome of creating a multi-layered structure is to encapsulate the DU in gold, thus reducing or perhaps preventing rapid oxidation of uranium, a known problem in the co-sputtered materials. Residual stress in coatings has been reduced to sufficiently low levels by optimizing deposition pressure allowing fabrication of free-standing cylinders and foils. Characterization of this type of sandwich material is difficult due to the fact that the cocktail region consists of buried interfaces, though promising results from Auger depth profiling show that the materials have sufficiently low oxygen content (<= 4 at. %) as well as the targeted composition.

Beginning in 1996, LLE filled and fielded targets containing DT gas with pressures as high as 30 atm. Facilities are being upgraded to prepare, characterize, and field targets with DT ice on their inner surface. To this end, process loops that can pressurize DT gas' to 1200 bar and operate at 17K are in the final stages of commissioning. To preclude both accidental and chronic tritium releases and to minimize the potential for exposures to personnel, both metal hydride-based and oxidation drier-based cleanup systems have been installed and commissioned with hydrogen. Cryogenic DT targets will be fielded in 2006.

The materials and exposure parameters were chosen to be relevant to proposed uses of similar materials in inertial fusion ignition experiments at the National Ignition Facility. Two types of samples were exposed and tested. The first type consisted of 10 4-lead ribbon cables offine manganin wire insulated with polyimide. Wires of this type are proposed for use in thermal shimming of hohlraums and the goal of this experiment was to measure the change in electrical resistance of the insulation due to tritium exposure. The second type of sample consisted of 20 planar polymer samples that may be used as ignition capsule materials. The exposure was at 34.5 GPa (5010 psia) and 70 degrees C for 48 h. The change in electrical resistance of the wire insulation will be presented. The results for capsule materials will be presented in a separate paper in this issue.

Organ-specific doses from lifetime occupational exposures and radionuclide intakes were estimated for an epidemiologic study of 5,801 Rocketdyne/Atomics International (AI) radiation workers engaged in nuclear technologies between 1948 and 1999. The entire workforce of 46,970 Rocketdyne/AI employees was identified from 35,042 Kardex work histories cards, 26,136 electronic personnel listings, and 14,189 radiation folders containing individual exposure histories. To obtain prior and subsequent occupational exposure information, the roster of all workers was matched against nationwide dosimetry riles from the Department of Energy, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Landauer dosimetry company, the U.S. Army, and the U.S. Air Force. Dosimetry riles of other worker studies were also accessed. Computation of organ doses from radionuclide intakes was complicated by the diversity of bioassay data collected over a 40-y period (urine and fecal samples, lung counts, whole-body counts, nasal smears, and wound and incident reports) and the variety of radionuclides with documented intake including isotopes of uranium, plutonium, americium, calcium, cesium, cerium, zirconium, thorium, polonium, promethium, iodine, zinc, strontium, and hydrogen (tritium). Over 30,000 individual bioassay measurements, recorded on 11 different bioassay forms, were abstracted. The bioassay data were evaluated using tCRP biokinetic models recommended in current or upcoming ICRP documents (modified for one inhaled material to reflect site-specific information) to estimate annual doses for 16 organs or tissues taking into account time of exposure, type of radionuclide, and excretion patterns. Detailed internal exposure scenarios were developed and annual internal doses were derived on a case-by-case basis for workers with committed equivalent doses indicated by screening criteria to be greater than 10 mSv to the organ with the highest internal dose. Overall, 5,801 workers were monitored for radiation at Rocketdyne/AI: 5,743 for external exposure and 2,232 for internal intakes of radionuclides; 41,169 workers were not monitored for radiation. The mean cumulative external dose based on Rocketdyne/AI records alone was 10.0 mSv, and the dose distribution was highly skewed with most workers experiencing low cumulative doses and only a few with high doses (maximum 500 mSv). Only 45 workers received greater than 200 mSv while employed at Rocketdyne/AI. However, nearly 32% (or 1,833) of the Rocketdyne/AI workers had been monitored for radiation at other nuclear facilities and incorporation of these doses increased the mean dose to 13.5 mSv (maximum 1,005 mSv) and the number of workers with > 200 mSv to 69. For a small number of workers (n = 292), lung doses from internal radionuclide intakes were relatively high (mean 106 mSv; maximum 3,560 mSv) and increased the overall population mean dose to 19.0 mSv and the number of workers with lung dose > 200 mSv to 109. Nearly 10% of the radiation workers (584) were monitored for neutron exposures (mean 1.2 mSv) at Rocketdyne/AI, and another 2% were monitored for neutron exposures elsewhere. Interestingly, 1,477 workers not monitored for radiation at Rocketdyne/AI (3.6%) were found to have worn dosimeters at other nuclear facilities (mean external dose of 2.6 mSv, maximum 188 mSv). Without considering all sources f occupational exposure, an incorrect characterization of worker exposure would have occurred with the potential to bias epidemiologic results. For these pioneering workers in the nuclear industry, 26.5% of their total occupational dose (collective dose) was received at other facilities both prior to and after employment at Rocketdyne/AI. In addition, a small number of workers monitored for internal radionuclides contributed disproportionately to the number of workers with high lung doses. Although nearly 12% of radiation workers had been monitored for neutron exposures during their career, the cumulative dose levels were small in comparison with other external and internal exposure. Risk estimates based on nuclear worker data must be interpreted cautiously if internally deposited radionuclides and occupational doses received elsewhere are not considered.

Between 1944 and 1957, radioactive 1311 was released into the environment from the Hanford site. Cancer mortality from 1950 through 2000 was evaluated in four counties with the highest estimated exposure to I-131 and compared with the cancer mortality experience in five demographically similar counties in Washington State with minimal 131 1 exposure. Overall, cancer rates in the study counties were slightly below those in the comparison counties [relative risk (RR) 0.95; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93-0.97], due mainly to a low risk for lung cancer (RR 0.89; 95 % CI 0.85-0.93). Thyroid cancer (n = 33; RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.56-1.26), female breast cancer (n = 1,233; RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.92-1.06), leukemia other than chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 492; RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.85-1.06), and childhood leukemia (n = 71; RR = 1.06; 95% CI 0.78-1.43) were not significantly increased in the exposed counties. Furthermore, there was no evidence that the cancer death rates over time differed between study and comparison counties. Patterns over time of thyroid cancer in particular were similar for exposure and comparison counties. Although based on a geographic correlation design, these data suggest that living near the Hanford site has not increased cancer rates.

J	Luciani, A; Polig, E; Lloyd, RD; Miller, SC				Luciani, A; Polig, E; Lloyd, RD; Miller, SC			Americium in the beagle dog: Biokinetic and dosimetric model	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						Am-241; biokinetics; dogs; skeleton	SKELETON; EMITTERS; HUMANS	A biokinetic model of the systemic distribution of americium in the beagle dog is presented. The model is based on a previous biokinetic model of plutonium. The data sets used for the development of the model were the measurements of excreted activity (urine and feces) and organ burdens (skeleton, liver, and other soft tissues) for different levels of initial injected activity. In developing the model, the compartmental structure of the skeleton of the plutonium model was adopted, and only the numerical values of parameters were adapted. The model well describes the fractions of americium in the skeleton, liver, and soft tissues and the total fraction excreted in urine and feces. The tuning of the liver clearance parameter provides a realistic description of the change in the partitioning between liver and skeleton for different injection levels. The most significant features of the biokinetics and dosimetry of americium and plutonium in beagles are compared. The total fractions of the clearance to the skeleton and the liver are roughly equal to the value for plutonium, but the partitioning of americium between these organs is reversed with respect to the partitioning of plutonium. Am-241 doses to liver and skeleton are similar to Pu-239 doses, owing to sonic counteracting factors. For the highest injection level, the liver mass is dependent on the time post injection. For the skeletal tissues, the dose to the cortical endosteum by far exceeds the dose to the trabecular endosteum and the red marrow. The model provides the basis for statistical survival analyses and risk estimates.

A host laboratory prepared six identical sets of twelve synthetic urine samples containing total uranium in the range of 25 to 770 ng U kg(-1) urine and with U-238/U-235 isotopic ratios ranging from 138 (100% NU) to 215 (51% DU). Sets of samples were shipped to five testing laboratories (four based in Canada and one based in Europe). Each laboratory utilized one of the following analytical techniques: sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-SF-MS), quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-Q-MS), thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS), and instrumental/delayed neutron activation analysis (I/DNAA), in their analyses.

J	Blair, P; Romano, A; HellWig, C; Chawla, R				Blair, P; Romano, A; HellWig, C; Chawla, R			Calculations on fission gas behaviour in the high burnup structure	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							GRAIN-BOUNDARY DIFFUSION; RE-SOLUTION; PWR FUELS; UO2 FUEL; RELEASE; IRRADIATION; RIM; EVOLUTION; LATTICE; SEM	The behaviour of fission gas in high burnup fuel during steady-state and transient conditions is of special interest for safety reasons. Despite this, mechanistic models that reflect the fission gas transport processes and reliably predict the evolution of the remaining fission gas in the high burnup structure (HBS) are largely missing today. We start to address this problem by developing a one-dimensional, mass balance model and apply it to LWR UO2 fuel at the moderate temperatures found in the rim region. We examine the quantity of gas remaining in the HBS fuel matrix at steady state and compare it with experimental values. We find that the current model reproduces the 0.2 wt% observed xenon concentration under certain conditions, viz. fast grain boundary diffusion and an effective volume diffusion coefficient. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted for the model parameters, the relative importance for which is not well established a priori. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, one of the limitation of the process is generation of large volume of alkaline liquid waste containing hexamethylenetetramine, urea, ammonium nitrate, ammonium hydroxide etc. Presence of ammonium nitrate with hexamethylenetetramine and urea presents a fire hazard which prevents direct disposal of the waste as well as its recycle by evaporation. The paper describes the studies carried out to suitably process the waste. Nitrate was removed from the waste by passing through Dowex I x 4 anion exchange resin in OH- form. 1.0 M NaOH was used to regenerate the resin. The nitrate-free waste was further treated to recover and recycle hexamethylenetetramine, urea and ammonium hydroxide for preparation Of UO3 microspheres. The quality of the microspheres obtained was satisfactory. An optimized flow sheet for processing of the waste solution has been suggested. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ferreira, RAN; Jordao, E				Ferreira, RAN; Jordao, E			A model for the behavior of thorium uranium mixed oxide kernels in the pelletizing process	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article								A behavior model of nuclear fuel kernels in the pelletizing process was developed to predict the microstructure of (Th,5%U)O-2 sintered pellets. Methods, equipments and components were developed in order to measure the density, the specific surface area and the crushing strength of the kernels and produce fuel pellets. It enables a correlation between the kernels properties and the microstructure, density and open porosity that were obtained in the fuel pellet produced with these kernels. It was possible to obtain a mathematical expression that allows one to calculate, from the kernel density and specific surface, the density that will be obtained in the fuel pellet for each compactation pressure value. The investigation showed which kernels properties are desired to obtain fuel pellets that satisfy the quality requirements for a stable performance in a power reactor. This model has been validated by experimental results and fuel pellets were obtained with an optimized microstructure that satisfies the fuel specification for an in-pile stable behavior.

Microstructural characterisation of the natural brannerite revealed minor alteration along the rim of the crystal and within cracks. The formation of UO2 particles and soluble Pb-Ca-rich aluminosilicate glass is responsible for the higher U and Pb releases from the recrystallised brannerite. In general, natural brannerite has been shown to be resistant to dissolution over geological time, therefore minor brannerite inclusions in ceramic formulations for immobilisation of actinide-rich radioactive wastes should not have a detrimental effect on the long-term chemical durability of the wasteforms.

J	Santos, BG; Noel, JJ; Shoesmith, DW				Santos, BG; Noel, JJ; Shoesmith, DW			The influence of calcium ions on the development of acidity in corrosion product deposits on SIMFUEL, UO2	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							SPENT NUCLEAR-FUEL; RAY PHOTOELECTRON-SPECTROSCOPY; SECONDARY PHASE-FORMATION; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; NEPTUNIUM INCORPORATION; OXIDIZING CONDITIONS; DISSOLUTION; PEROXIDE; 90-DEGREES-C; BEHAVIOR	In order to clarify the influence of groundwater constituents on the formation of corrosion products and secondary phase deposits on corroding/dissolving nuclear fuel surfaces under waste disposal conditions we have investigated the influence of Ca2+, present as CaCl2. The influence of calcium ions on the anodic dissolution of SIMFUEL (doped uranium dioxide) has been characterized over the potential range 0-500 mV (vs. SCE). Through the use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) the surface composition over this potential range has been determined. Ca2+ was found not to influence the conversion of (UO2)-O-IV to (U1-2xU2xO2+x)-U-IV-O-V, but to suppress the subsequent formation of a U-VI surface species which lead to the formation of a hydrated deposit, UO3 center dot yH(2)O. The adsorption of Ca2+ on the UO2 surface is believed to inhibit fuel dissolution either via inhibiting the stabilization of the cation precursor (UO2(OH)(2))(ads) or by blocking the O2- anion transfer reaction from the fuel surface.

The porous media approach was applied for the core region containing 380 calandria tubes. An anisotropic hydraulic resistance model for the porous media has been developed based on the empirical pressure loss correlations. The selected event was the 35% RIH (Reactor Inlet Header) break with a loss of ECC (Emergency Core Cooling) injection, which has been known to give the largest heat load to the moderator among all the DBA's (Design Basis Accidents). The calculation has been successfully done until 1,200s after the break, when most of the considerable heat transfer procedure has been completed. During this LOCA (Loss of Coolant Accident) transient, the local subcoolings in the vicinity of any PT/CT (Pressure Tube/Calandria Tube) contact does not drop below the experimentally derived subcooling threshold of 30 degrees C. Because the minimum subcoolings reach only a few degrees to the threshold temperature during the initial 20-40 s, future work on the CANDU moderator circulation needs to be aimed at determining whether this small subcooling margin covers the uncertainty of the moderator analysis.

J	Jernkvist, LO				Jernkvist, Lars Olof			Computational assessment of burnup-dependent fuel failure thresholds for reactivity initiated accidents	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						reactivity initiated accident; REA; CRDA; fuel rod; failure; melting; uranium dioxide; high burnup; clad tube; zirconium alloy	UO2 FUELS; BEHAVIOR; MOX	Best-estimate computational methods are here used to analyse the thermo-mechanical behaviour of high-burnup UO2 fuel rods under postulated reactivity initiated accidents in light water reactors. The considered accident scenarios are the hot zero power rod ejection accident in pressurised water reactors and the cold zero power control rod drop accident in boiling water reactors. For these accidents, fuel enthalpy thresholds associated with clad tube failure and fuel incipient melting are determined with respect to fuel burnup in the range from 30 to 70 MWd(kgU)(-1). The thresholds for clad tube failure are calculated by means of a strain-based clad failure criterion, which rests upon data from more than 200 out-of-pile mechanical property tests on recrystallized Zircaloy-2 and stress relieved annealed Zircaloy-4 cladding. The enthalpy thresholds for fuel incipient melting are calculated, considering the depression of fuel melting point with increasing burnup as well as burnup-related changes to the pellet radial temperature distribution. The calculated enthalpy thresholds for both clad tube failure and fuel incipient melting drop moderately with increasing burnup, and the thresholds are similar for the pressurised and boiling water reactor accidents under consideration. Extensive sensitivity studies are carried out, in order to quantify uncertainties in the calculated best-estimate thresholds.

As part of HLLW treatment, the adsorbent is subjected to strong irradiation. Therefore, the durability of CMPO-adsorbent under gamma-ray irradiation conditions was studied. CMPO decomposed to phosphoric acid after a transition to octylphenyl phosphinic acid (OPP). The adsorbed amount of actinoids and lanthanoids were found to decrease linearly with increasing irradiation dose. However, at a dose of 2 MGy, the CMPO-adsorbent was able to maintain adsorption at a rate of 80% of its initial capacity. Based on this finding, it is estimated that the adsorbent can be used in the treatment of HLLW for 400-500 cycles. Radiolytic degradation products increase with increasing irradiation dose caused by HLLW. If OPP accumulates in a CMPO-adsorbent, actinoids and lanthanoids are not recovered. OPP dissolves easily by washing with an eluent, suggesting that OPP would not accumulate in the adsorbent. After washing, separation performance was maintained with a dose of 2 MGy.

From the voltammograms, the reduction potentials of the uranium oxide and Li2O were obtained. From the chronopotentiometries based on the results of the voltammograms, the uranium oxide was reduced to uranium metal through the reduction mechanisms showing a more than 99% conversion. For a verification of the reduction mechanisms feasibility, basic data on the electrolytic reduction of the uranium oxide was obtained from the experiments and the characteristics of the closed recycle of Li2O were discussed.

For public health and safety reasons, INER dismantled step by step its expired nuclear facilities. Integrated Decommissioning Information Management System (IDIMS) was developed to ensure safety of dismantling and to record all activity data during the decommissioning project. These recorded activity data range from data of planning, licensing, post-operation to those of radioactive waste management and storage. In addition, IDIMS was expected to preserve decommissioning knowledge using information technology from practical data and problem solving. It also is anticipated that IDIMS will be an important knowledge repository and design base for decommissioning projects of nuclear power plants in Taiwan.

However, results of experimental studies indicate that colloid migration through the barrier (breakthrough) depends upon the partial density of the montmorillonite buffer. To assess the possibility of colloid breakthrough, interstitial pore size as a function of montmorillonite partial density is estimated through a homogenization analysis. Homogenization analysis indicates that interstitial pores sizes of <= 1 nm may be achieved for montmorillonite partial densities in excess of 1.2 Mg/m(3). It should be noted that this estimation depends upon the specific structural/geometric parameters of the compacted bentonite under consideration.

The Sr-90-content in samples of vegetables, soil and water (obtained from Environmental Measurement Laboratory, USA) were determined and the results were controlled by classical methods and by using an anion-exchanger and an alcohol solution of nitric acid for the strontium isolation. These methods were previously tested by determining Sr-90 in IAEA 326 and 327 samples of soil. It is shown that the isolation process with Sr resin is simpler and faster than the classical and mixed solvent anion-exchange methods. The efficiency of isolation on a Sr column depends on the resin quantity and separation conditions; and is the highest with a Sr column, compared to the classical and anion-exchange methods. Experimental data and theoretical models were used to calculate the parameters that enable the estimation of optimum dimensions of the column for isolation.

A virtual increase in sorptive concentration ( from 1.0.10(-8) to 1.0.10(-2) mol. dm(-3)) and pH ( from 2.4 to 10.2) and temperature ( from 303 to 333 K) enhanced the uptake of cesium on stannic phosphate. However, the extremely high degree of uptake of cesium on zirconium phosphate was almost unaffected with the dilution beyond 10(-5) mol. dm(-3) and pH ( i. e., from 2.4 to 10.2) and temperature ( from 303 to 323 K). Irreversible uptake occurring for these solids follow the Freundlich adsorption isotherm and the presence of several complexing agents viz., sulphate, phosphate, glycine and EDTA did not affect appreciably the uptake of cesium on zirconium phosphate but it did affect for stannic phosphate system. Both these solids showed good radiation stability towards a 11.1 GBq Ra - Be neutron source having neutron flux ca. 3.2.10(6) n. cm(-2). s(-1) and associated with a nominal gamma-dose of ca. 1.72 Gy/h, at least for the uptake of cesium.

J	Ozeroglu, C; Keceli, G				Ozeroglu, C; Keceli, G			Removal of strontium ions by a crosslinked copolymer containing methacrylic acid functional groups	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ATOMIC-ABSORPTION-SPECTROMETRY; RADIOACTIVE-WASTE MANAGEMENT; AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; UNSATURATED POLYESTER; ADSORPTION; SORPTION; MANGANESE; CADMIUM; COPPER; ZINC	A tail-made polymer matrix is proposed to remove strontium ions from aqueous solutions. The removal behavior of strontium ions on a crosslinked copolymer containing methacrylic acid as functional groups was investigated as a function of sorptive concentration, time, temperature and pH. It was observed that an increase of these parameters enhanced the removal of Sr(II) ions from aqueous solution. It is found that a maximum adsorption of Sr(II) ions can be obtained on the crosslinked copolymer after 30 minutes and at pH 8. The increase of Sr(II) ion concentration in the solution resulted in an increase in the amount of Sr(II) ions adsorbed on the crosslinked copolymer containing methacrylic acid as functional groups. However, after a maximum of Sr(II) concentration in the solution, the percentage of adsorbed Sr(II) ions decreased. The adsorption data are well represented by the Freundlich, Langmuir and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) isotherms. The adsorption capacity of the copolymer and the free energy change were calculated by using the D-R isotherm. For the adsorption of Sr(II) ions on the crosslinked copolymer the thermodynamic parameters (Delta H degrees, Delta S degrees and Delta G degrees) were calculated.

The specific concentrations for Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40, ranged from 20 - 88, 13 - 115 and 54 - 304 Bq/kg, respectively. The average specific activities of these radionuclides were compared. Higher values of Ra-226 and Th-232 could be noticed in marble while that of K-40 was in red bricks. Radium equivalent activities, dose rate and the annual gonadal dose equivalents AGDE were calculated for the measured samples to assess the radiation hazard arising from using those materials in the construction of dwellings. The radioactive heat production values of the selected materials have also been determined. They vary from a minimum of 0.41 for white cement to a maximum of 5.52 mu W/m(3) for marble samples. The calculated heat-production values are quite similar to those estimated in Corsica.

The sorption behavior of the solvent impregnated resin (SIR) towards thorium ion, including batch equilibrium, and kinetic operation are described. Different factors affecting the uptake of metal ions and hence, the separation efficiency of the impregnated resins were investigated. The maximum uptakes of Th4+ were found to be 62.9, 66.7 and 92.6% for DB18C6, 18C6 and 15C5, respectively. Synergistic extraction of various CE towards thorium ion was tested with cyanex-301 to enhance the sorption capacity as well as the selective separation efficiency. A relatively high capacity of the chelating resin towards tetravalent thorium was found. The capacities of the co-impregnated resins were found to be 2.11, 2.42 and 3.85 mmol/g for DB18C6, 18C6 and 15C5, respectively. The impregnated resin containing cyanex-301 and 15C5 can be utilized for selective separation and pre-concentration of thorium ion from nitrate medium in the presence of several interfering metal ions.

Influences of solid/liquid ratio, pH, metal ion concentration, particle size and temperature were studied. The optimum initial pH is 4.2, while the maximum sorption capacities for the prepared impregnated resins in benzene, xylene, chloroform and toluene diluents are 18.52, 14.98, 14.79 and 5.94 mg. g(-1), respectively. The sorption process is found to be affected by both metal ion concentration and particle size of the impregnated resin. Thermodynamic parameters for the sorption of Eu( III) were determined and the reaction is found to be exothermic and spontaneous with enthalpy - 14.23 and - 23.71 kJ. mol(-1) for benzene and xylene as diluents. Release of the element from the loaded solid particles into 0.01M HNO3 is congruent to 85% and congruent to 53% from 8-HQ/benzene/silica gel and 8-HQ/xylene/silica gel.

Removal of uranyl ions from wastewaters using cellulose and modified cellulose materials	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							DERIVATIVES; COPPER(II); COMPLEXES; SORPTION	Three silylcellulosic derivatives with different substitution degree were examined as sorbents for uranyl ions. The adsorption rate and capacity of cellulose and modified cellulose were investigated in aqueous media, at various pH and temperature values. The polymer - metal complexes of UO22+ were characterized by infrared and electronic spectra, and thermogravimetry. The thermal behavior of cellulose (C), trimethylsilyl - cellulose (tmsc, SD= 2.85) and triphenylsilyl - cellulose (TPSC1, SD=2.89 and TPSC2, SD =2.70) and their complexes with uranyl ions in atmospheric air has been studied between room temperature and 600 degrees C. The Coats-Redfern method was applied to estimate the kinetic parameters. The results revealed that the complexation of C and TMSC with UO22+ increases the thermal stability.

A comprehensive investigation of the above decontamination method have revealed that the fundamental issues of analytical chemistry and corrosion science were not taken into consideration during the elaboration of AP-CITROX procedure. Therefore, the non-regenerative version of the technology utilized at Paks NPP can be considered to be not an adequate method for the chemical decontamination of any reactor equipments having large steel surfaces (e.g., SGs). As a consequence of the lack of the appropriate decontamination method, initiation of a R&D project focused on the elaboration of the required technology should not be postponed. In this paper, we present a brief overview on the fundamental issues of the technology development. Selected findings obtained in our laboratory on the field of the improvement of the AP-CITROX technology are also reviewed in order to demonstrate the crucial role of some selection criteria.

The cation-exchange studies involved the sorption of UO22+ and Th4+ and their cationic complexes onto Dowex 50Wx8 and Dowex 50Wx4 resins (50-100 mesh). The batch data yielded a separation factor (K-d,K-Th/K-d,K-U) value of > 100 for the cation-exchanger, Dowex 50Wx4 at 1-2M HNO3. Separation of uranium from thorium was also carried out by column method in nitric acid medium using cation-exchangers, Dowex 50Wx4 as well as Dowex 50Wx8. While uranium elution was possible at 1M HNO3, Th could be eluted only at higher concentration of nitric acid (> 6M). The stripped solution emanating from a mixer settler employing di-2-ethyl hexyl isobutyramide as extractant and feed solution similar to THOREX process comprising 350 mg/l U and 380 mg/l Th in 0.75M HNO3 was loaded on the column and the decontamination factor value for U in the product was > 1000.
