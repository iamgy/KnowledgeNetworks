Assessment of gamma dose rates from terrestrial exposure in Serbia and Montenegro	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; SOIL SAMPLES; RADIATION; POPULATION; EGYPT	The gamma dose rates due to naturally occuring terrestrial radionuclides (Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40) were calculated based on their activities in soil samples, determined by gamma-ray spectrometry. A total of 140 soil samples from 21 different regions of Serbia and Montenegro were collected. The gamma dose rates ranged from 7.40 to 29.7 nGy h(-1) for Ra-226, from 12.9 to 46.5 nGy h(-1) for Th-232 and from 12.5 to 37.1 nGy h(-1) for K-40. The total absorbed gamma dose rate due to these radionuclides varied from 34.5 to 97.6 nGy h(-1) with mean of 66.8 nGy h(-1). Assuming a 20% occupancy factor, the corresponding annual effective dose varied from 4.23 x 10(-5) to 11.9 x 10(-5) Sv with mean of 8.19 x 10(-5) Sv, i.e. the dose was lower than world wide average value. According to the values of external hazard index (mean: 0.39) obtained in this study, the radiation hazard was found to be insignificant for population living in the investigated area.

The mean values of the radioactivity concentrations were calculated as 66, 126 and 589 Bq kg(-1) for Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40, respectively. The radium equivalent activities ranged between 131 and 712 Bq kg(-1), with six of the samples exceeding the UNSCEAR reported maximum permissible level of 370 Bq kg(-1). The mean radium equivalent activity (292 Bq kg(-1)) is higher than the values available in the literature for some countries by factors ranging between 2 and 5, a situation that can be traced to the practice of sourcing sand aggregates from mining sites. The indoor annual effective dose for a dwelling of dimension 3.6 x 3.6 x 3.0 m(3) was calculated as 0.81 mSv.

These are the activity concentrations that cause a 0.1 mSv annual effective dose for users of drinking water. The maximum annual effective doses from Ra-226 and Ra-228 for users of drilled wells were 0.21 mSv, and 0.16 mSv respectively. The elevated activity concentrations of Ra-226 and Ra-228 did not occur simultaneously in the same groundwaters and the correlation between Ra-226 and Ra-228 was small.

J	Al-Azmi, D				Al-Azmi, Darwish			Towards the use of small amounts of activated charcoal along with well-type NaI(Tl) detector for indoor radon measurements	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							RN-222; AIR	The feasibility of using small quantities of activated charcoal and a 7.6 cm x 7.6 cm NaI(Tl) well-type detector was investigated for indoor radon measurements. Vials, filled with 10 g of charcoal, were exposed for different indoor radon concentration levels typical of Kuwait dwellings. After exposure, the vials were sealed and kept for 3 h to allow radon to come into radioactive equilibrium with its progenies and were then analysed by gamma-ray spectrometry using the well-type NaI(Tl) detector. The variation of radon absorption by the vials filled with charcoal with exposure time was also studied. A comparative study of the present technique with the standard technique of using 70 g charcoal canisters and flat NaI detector was also performed. After establishing the suitability of the technique, the charcoal vials were then used to investigate the effect of air-ventilation on the concentration levels of the indoor radon. Results show that there is a reduction in the radon concentration level (up to 25%) when the air-ventilation system was switched on. The paper presents the results of the study on the feasibility of combining small amounts of activated charcoal with a well-type NaI(Tl) detector in the measurement of indoor radon concentrations.

Gamma shielding factor for typical houses in Brazil	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							RATE CONVERSION FACTORS; URBAN ENVIRONMENTS; EXPOSURES; RADIATION; SURFACES	The housing features in a country depend much on its climate. Dwellings in warm countries are much lighter constructions than in cold ones, which will reflect on the amount of shielding against radiation they provide. In addition to that, wealth is another factor that influences the building's finishing. Great effort has been taken to determine parameters to more accurately estimate dose to a population in case of a radioactive or nuclear accident. Nevertheless, most available data are concerned with typical housing in cold climate countries. This study aims to determine shielding factors for typical building materials used in the southeast of Brazil, a warm area, due to radioactive material deposited on the surrounding field, walls and ceiling of the external surfaces. The shielding factors determination was performed by simulation with the MCNP5 Monte Carlo computer code. The air kerma indoors for the 300, 662 and 3000 keV photon energies have been determined for three different housing patterns, ranging from the very simple to a very complex structure. The shielding factor, defined as the ratio of the air kerma indoor to the air kerma in open field, for the most simple house type and 300 keV photon energy was found to be twice of the best finished one for the same energy.

Unexpectedly high activity of Th-228 in excretion samples following consumption of Brazil nuts	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							AREA	A worker provided a routine faecal sample for plutonium and americium analysis. In the course of this analysis 500 mBq of Th-228 was discovered. There seemed no credible occupational route for intake of thorium. Further investigation revealed that the worker consumed similar to 25 g d(-1) of nuts, including Brazil nuts. A sample of these nuts was analysed and found to contain activities of Th-228 in sufficient quantity to account for the faecal activity. However, follow-up urine samples taken from the worker showed 0.6-0.7 mBq of Th-228. The intake of Th-228 via nuts is insufficient to account for this activity in urine. However, it is likely that the intake of Th-228 was accompanied by similar activity of the parent Ra-228, and biokinetic calculations show that decay of Ra-228 in vivo would produce sufficient Th-228 to account for the observed urine activity.

Radiation exposure during travelling in Malaysia	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								Absorbed dose rates in vehicles during travelling by different modes of transport in Malaysia were measured. Radiation levels measured on roads in Peninsular Malaysia were within a broad range, i.e. between 36 and 1560 nGy h(-1). The highest reading, recorded while travelling near monazite and zircon mineral dumps, was 13 times the mean environmental radiation level of Malaysia. It is evident that radioactive material dumps on the roadsides can influence the radiation level on the road. The absorbed dose rates measured while travelling on an ordinary train were between 60 and 350 nGy h(-1). The highest reading was measured when the train passed a tunnel built through a granite rock hill. The measurement during sea travelling by ferries gave the lowest radiation level owing to merely cosmic radiation at the sea level.

Natural background dose and radium equivalent measurements at Ikogosi warm spring, Nigeria	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							RADIOACTIVITY	The natural background dose and the radium equivalent due to the natural radioactivity levels in rocks and sediments collected around Ikogosi warm spring, Nigeria, has been determined in this study using a highly sensitive HpGe detector. The mean activity concentration of K-40, Ra-226 and Ac-228 were measured to be 585.50 +/- 17.40 Bq kg(-1), 66.91 +/- 5.23 Bq kg(-1) and 48.91 +/- 2.10 Bq kg(-1), respectively, in rock samples while in sediment samples the activity concentrations were found to be 113.89 +/- 5.64 Bq kg(-1) for K-40, 21.47 +/- 5.14 Bq kg(-1) for Ra-226 and14.20 +/- 1.07 Bq kg(-1) for Ac-228. This mean values give rise to average absorbed dose rate of 85.87 nGy h(-1) at a distance of 1.0 m above the ground level and a mean human effective dose equivalent of 0.53 man Sv y(-1) for rock samples. A radium equivalent of 50.55 Bq kg(-1) was measured for the sediment samples. The radium equivalent value is far less than the 370 Bq kg(-1) limit for materials that can be used as building materials while the human effective dose equivalent falls below the world average background dose of 2.4 man Sv y(-1).

Some principles of service life calculation of reinforcements and in situ corrosion monitoring by sensors in the radioactive waste containers of El Cabril disposal (Spain)	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							CHLORIDE DIFFUSION-COEFFICIENTS; CONCRETE	Reinforced concrete is the most usual material used in engineered barriers in low-level nuclear waste disposal facilities. The record of modern concrete is no longer than about 100 years. During this time, it has been noticed that the material gives a good performance in many environments, however several chemical aggressive species in water, soil or the atmosphere may react with the cement mineralogical phases and perturb its integrity. El Cabril repository has a design life objective of longer than 300 years and therefore, these structures should maintain their main characteristics during this target service life. The potential aggressive conditions that the cement-based materials can suffer have been identified to be: carbonation, water permeation (leaching) and reinforcement corrosion. More unlikely may be the biological attack. Chlorides are not in the environment but they are inside the drums as part of analytical wastes. Vaults and containers are made of a very similar concrete composition while the mortar is specifically designed to be pumpable, with low hydration heat, low shrinkage and of low permeability. In this paper results of concrete characteristics are given as well as the monitoring of the behaviour of reinforcement corrosion parameters from 1995 on the same environmental conditions of the actual waste. This monitoring has been made in a buried structure with embedded sensors. The effect of temperature is commented. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Mixed-material layer formation on graphite exposed to deuterium plasmas containing beryllium	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							CHEMICAL EROSION; DOPED GRAPHITES; FACING COMPONENTS; CROSS-SECTIONS; RETENTION; ITER; DEPOSITION; CARBIDES; FILMS; FLUX	Mixed-materials formation and properties are examined for graphite-target surfaces exposed to deuterium plasma containing small amounts of ionized beryllium. Targets are exposed to plasma in the PISCES-B divertor plasma simulator under conditions relevant to the operation of the graphite-strike plates in ITER. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to analyze targets following exposure and reveals chemical reaction of the surface graphite with the incident-plasma beryllium flux. Partial surface carbidization is observed for a target exposure temperature of 450 K and full surface carbidization with Be,C at temperatures higher than this up to 1000 K. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) data reveal a mixed-material layer of Be/C of varying-elemental concentration up to similar to 1 mu m thick. Hydrogen-isotope retention in targets is measured using thermal-desorption spectrometry (TDS) and D-He-3 nuclear-reaction analysis (NRA). Targets exposed to deuterium plasma exhibit retention consistent with values in the literature but extrapolated to the higher ion fluences possible in PISCES simulators. In contrast, targets with a mixed-material Be/C layer are found to have increased retention by a factor of similar to 4 at low temperature similar to 300 K and similar to 2 at higher temperature similar to 1000 K. Simulation of NRA spectra reveals that most of the increased inventory is accumulated in the mixed layer. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A suitable glass matrix based on barium borosilicate has been developed for immobilization of sulphate bearing HLW. Various compositions based on different glass formulations were made to examine compatibility with waste oxide with around 10 wt% sulfate content. The vitrified waste product obtained from barium borosilicate glass matrix was extensively evaluated for its characteristic properties like homogeneity, chemical durability, glass transition temperature, thermal conductivity, impact strength, etc. using appropriate techniques. Process parameters like melt viscosity and pour temperature were also determined. It is found that SB-44 glass composition (SiO2: 30.5 wt%, B-2,O-3: 20.0 wt%, Na2O: 9.5 wt% and BaO: 19.0 wt%) can be safely loaded with 21 wt% waste oxide without any phase separation. The other product qualities of SB-44 waste glass are also found to be on a par with internationally adopted waste glass matrices. This formulation has been successfully implemented in plant scale.

Consequences of the ion beam irradiation on the chemical durability of thorium phosphate diphosphate - kinetics study	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							LEVEL NUCLEAR-WASTE; SOLID-SOLUTIONS; LEACHING TESTS; SINTERED SAMPLES; DEGREES-C; DISSOLUTION; THORIUM-URANIUM(IV); CERAMICS; MONAZITE; HYDROGENPHOSPHATE	In the field of the long-term specific immobilization of actinides, thorium phosphate diphosphate (beta-TPD), as potential candidate, must respond to several criteria. Among them, the material must present a good resistance to irradiation and keep its initial good properties such as resistance to aqueous alteration. In order to check this later point, sintered samples of beta-TUPD solid solutions were pre-irradiated with ion beams with various conditions (fluence, stopping power) then submitted to leaching tests in different media (pH, temperature, complexing reagents, flow rate,...). The normalized dissolution rates depend significantly on the amorphous fraction (increase by a factor of 10-100 between unirradiated and fully amorphized materials). On the contrary, the pre-irradiation of the samples does not affect the kinetic parameters of the dissolution such as the partial order relative to the proton concentration (n = 0.37 +/- 0.01 and n = 0.34 +/- 0.01 for unirradiated and fully amorphized samples, respectively) and the activation energy of the reaction of dissolution (E(aap) = 49 +/- 4 kJ mol(-1) and E(app) = 42 +/- 4 kJ mol(-1) for unirradiated and partly amorphized samples (f(A) < 1), respectively).

J	Hossain, MM; Ekeroth, E; Jonsson, M				Hossain, Mohammad Mohsin; Ekeroth, Ella; Jonsson, Mats			Effects of HCO3- on the kinetics of UO2 oxidation by H2O2	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; EQUILIBRIA	The effect of HCO3- on the kinetics of UO2 oxidation by H2O2 in aqueous solution has been studied using powder suspensions where the concentration of H2O2 was monitored as a function of time. By varying the UO2 surface to solution volume ratio second order rate constants were obtained for HCO3- concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 mM. The second order rate constant increases linearly with HCO3- concentration from 0 to approximately 1 mM. Above 1 mM HCO3- the rate constant is 4.4 x 10(-6) m min(-1) independent of [HCO3-]. This indicates that the kinetics of the reaction depends on both oxidation and dissolution below 1 mM HCO3- while at higher concentrations it is solely governed by oxidation. Hence, the rate constant obtained at HCO3- concentrations above 1 mM is the true rate constant for oxidation of UO2 by H2O2. The results also imply that the reaction between HCO3- and oxidized UO2 on the UO2 surface (i.e. HCO3- facilitated dissolution) is limited by diffusion (ca 10(-3) m min(-1) in the present system). Furthermore, the experimental results were used to estimate the oxidation site density of the powder used (126 sites nm(-1)) and the rate constant for dissolution of UO22+ from the UO2 surface (7 x 10(-8) Mol m(-2) s(-1)).

Molecular dynamics simulation study of primary damage in UO2 produced by cascade overlaps	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							HIGH-ENERGY CASCADES; DISPLACEMENT CASCADES; DEFECT PRODUCTION; COMPUTER-SIMULATION; RADIATION-DAMAGE; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; METALS; TEMPERATURE; IRON; EVOLUTION	Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is used to simulate the primary damage state due to alpha-self-irradiation in a UO2 matrix. This study is carried out by simulating a set of 5 keV displacement cascades. Primary knock-on atom (PKA) direction and temperature are found not to influence the creation of point defects and point defects clustering. In the cascade overlap sequences the number of point defects created saturates as the dose increases. Large clusters of vacancies are observed toward the end of the overlap sequences. These clusters are stable within the time scale of the MD simulations. Interstitial clusters are found to be small and isolated. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Fukada, S; Morisaki, A				Fukada, Satoshi; Morisaki, Akio			Hydrogen permeability through a mixed molten salt of LiF, NaF and KF (Flinak) as a heat-transfer fluid	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							FLIBE BLANKET; TRITIUM; SOLUBILITIES; DIFFUSION; FLUORIDES; DEUTERIUM; RECOVERY; RATES	Permeability, diffusivity and solubility of hydrogen in Flinak, a mixed molten salt of LiF (46.5%), NaF (11.5%) and KF (42%), were determined using a vessel supported by a Ni plate. Diffusion-limiting permeation was confirmed by experimental data where hydrogen permeation rates were in reverse proportion to the thickness of Flinak. Diffusivities determined in the range of 500-750 degrees C were correlated to an Arrhenius equation with the activation energy of 50 kJ/mol. Since the dependence of hydrogen solubility in Flinak on pressure was almost linear, hydrogen was dissolved as H-2 in Flinak. The H-2 solubility in Flinak was correlated to a Henry law, and its solubility constant was discussed in terms of macroscopic surface tension and unspecified interaction energy between the molten salt and dissolved gaseous molecules.

J	Min, BT; Song, JH; Park, YS; Kim, JG				Min, Beong Tae; Song, Jin Ho; Park, Yang Soon; Kim, Jong Gu			A physical and chemical analysis of fast quenched particles of UO2 and ZrO2 mixture	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							UO2/ZRO2 MIXTURE; FARO	An interaction between molten fuel of a nuclear reactor, which is called corium and mainly consisted of UO2 and ZrO2, and sub-cooled water may result in a steam explosion. It is one of the outstanding reactor safety issues. To investigate the fundamental mechanism behind the recent experimental observation that the composition of the material highly affected the strength of the steam explosion, a physical and chemical analysis for the fast quenched particles of UO2 and ZrO2 mixture at different compositions was performed. Six cases were selected for the study, in which the melt composition was changed, while other initial and boundary conditions of the molten fuel and water interaction tests were maintained the same. It was observed that the cases at eutectic composition resulted in a spontaneous steam explosion, while the cases at non-eutectic composition did not result in a spontaneous steam explosion. Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) was performed for fast quenched particles along a cross-section. Results demonstrated that the UO2 and ZrO2 mixtures formed a solid solution of U1-xZrxO2. The mechanism for the hydrogen generation during the molten material and water interaction was examined by thermogravity analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and hydrogen reduction analysis. It was demonstrated that the hydrogen generation was not directly related to the oxidation of UO2. Morphologies observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that the particles from the eutectic mixture had many holes, while the particles at non-eutectic mixture did not. The existence of mush phase for the non-eutectic mixture is suggested to be the reason for the non-explosive nature. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This is done by a large electrostatic retarding spectrometer, which is followed by an electron detector. Key requirements for this detector are a large sensitive area (similar to 80 cm(2)), a certain energy resolution (Delta E = 600 eV at 18.6 keV) but also a certain spatial resolution (similar to 3 mm) which leads to a multi-pixel design. We present as a tentative design a detector system with a reduced size (16 cm(2)) and a reduced pixel number (64), making use of a monolithic segmented silicon PIN diode. Apart from a description of the electronic design, very first results are presented showing the capability of this detector technology to detect electrons from Tritium beta-decay on a large entry window.

The ion exchange phase in corrosion of nuclear waste glasses	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							BOROSILICATE GLASS; ALKALI; PH; DISSOLUTION; MECHANISMS; DIFFUSION; HYDRATION; KINETICS	The diffusion-controlled ion exchange phase in the corrosion of nuclear waste borosilicate glasses has been examined using the Doremus' model accounting for interdiffusion and exchange of the cations in the glass with protons from the water. Ion exchange is the principal radionuclide release mechanism for conditions when glass network hydrolysis is suppressed, such as in silica-saturated solutions when ion exchange may persist over geological time scales. In dilute aqueous solutions ion exchange controls the initial cation release and can dominate for tens and many hundreds of years if temperatures are low at low and neutral pH. Ion exchange rates are shown to have inverse square root time dependences, an Arrhenius-controlled temperature relationship and a 10(-0.5pH) dependence with the pH of the contacting water. Due to radioactive decay the radionuclide releases from nuclear waste glasses are limited to certain upper values, which can be calculated based on available experimental data. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The anisotropic scattering effect increases the assembly k(infinity) by 0.44% Delta k for the UO2 assembly with 0% void fraction, and by 0.21% Delta k for the MOX assembly with 0% void fraction. This is because the anisotropic scattering effect flattens the intra-assembly thermal flux, and the absorption rate in the surrounding water gap is decreased, but the absorption rates in the MOX fuel rods are increased compared to the UO2 rods. Therefore, the total decrease in absorption rates in the UO2 assembly is relatively large, and the k(infinity) is increased in the UO2 assembly. The dependence of the anisotropic scattering effect on the void fraction is investigated, and the significant difference of 0.62% Delta k/k is found for the 0% and the 80% void fractions. The BWR assemblies with Gd rods are also considered. Furthermore, the usefulness of the transport cross section is investigated, and it is found that the transport cross section gives reasonable anisotropic scattering effect, though not satisfactory.

The excellent neutronic properties of helium allows for a low plutonium fraction in the fuel, which yields a low reactivity swing, Delta k = 2600 pcm, for a burnup of 31.2%. Further the neutron spectrum is hard, limiting the buildup of Cm and Cf. The high burnup combined with a minor actinide burning rate of 355 kg/GWth year makes the present design an attractive transmutation system. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ubeyli, M				Ubeyli, Mustafa			Neutronic performance of HYLIFE-II fusion reactor using various thorium molten salts	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							POWER-PLANT DESIGN; LWR SPENT FUEL; RADIATION-DAMAGE; BREEDER; BLANKET; WALL	HYLIFE-II is one of the major inertial fusion energy reactor design concepts in which a thick molten salt layer (Flibe = Li2BeF4) is injected between the reaction chamber walls and the explosions. Molten salt coolant eliminates the frequent replacement of solid first wall structure during reactors lifetime by decreasing intense neutron flux. This study presents the neutronic analysis of HYLIFE-II fusion reactor using various liquid wall coolants, namely, 75% LiF-25% ThF4, 75% LiF-24% ThF4-1% (UF4)-U-233 or 75% LiF-23% ThF4-2% 233UF4. Neutron transport calculations for the evaluation of neutron spectra were conducted with the help of scale 4.3 by solving the Boltzmann transport equation in S-8-P-3 approximation. The effects of flowing liquid wall thickness and type of coolant on the neutronic performance of the reactor were investigated. Furthermore, radiation damage calculations at the first wall structure with respect to type and thickness of liquid wall were carried out. Numerical results showed that using the flowing liquid wall containing the molten salt, 75% LiF-23% ThF4-2% UF4 with a thickness of similar to 70 cm maintained tritium self-sufficiency of the (DT) fusion driver and extended the first wall lifetime to the reactors lifetime (similar to 30 full power years). In addition significant amount of high quality fissile fuel was bred through (n, gamma) reaction of Th-232. Moreover, energy multiplication factor (M) was increased to similar to 12 by high rate fission reactions of U-233 occurring in the flowing wall. On the other hand, it was concluded that using the other two coolants, 75% LiF-25% ThF4 or 75% LiF-24% ThF4 1% (UF4)-U-233, as liquid wall did not satisfy the radiation damage and the tritium sufficiency criteria together at any thickness, so that these two coolants were not suitable to improve neutronic performance of HYLIFE-II reactor.

About 5-10 kg of molten material with enough superheat was poured into a pool of water in a test section at room temperature to simulate ex-vessel steam explosion in the reactor situation. Most of the experiments were externally triggered. The purpose of the experiments was to investigate the effect of material composition and average void fraction on the strength of a prototypic steam explosion, which were highlighted as major unresolved issues. The experiments were performed using two kinds of mixtures, one, corium A, at 70:30 weight percent composition of UO2 and ZrO2, close to eutectic composition, and the other, corium B, at 80:20 weight percent. Also, two kinds of cylindrical test sections having a different diameter were used. It turned out that corium A was likely to produce an energetic steam explosion, while corium B seldom led to an energetic steam explosion. The existence of mush phase for the non-eutectic mixture is suggested to be the reason for the difference. Comparative cross sectional views of the corium particles by scanning electron microscope supported the proposed argument. The tests performed with a narrow test section seldom led to an energetic steam explosion for both materials. An increase in average void is suggested to be the reason for the non-explosive behavior, which is consistent with the physical models employed in the current steam explosion computer codes.

Optimization of the thorium-uranium regime in CANDU heavy-water reactors	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								Two operating regimes of a heavy-water power reactor operating in a thorium-uranium fuel cycle are examined: accumulation of the required amount of U-233 and self-fueling with U-233 fuel. The parameters of 10 variants of the core-lattice cells of a heavy-water power reactor are calculated. The lattice spacing is kept constant and the variants differ by the number of channels, containing fuel elements or targets, and the U-233 content in ThO2. Combined channels containing fuel elements and a target at the same time are examined. Preference is given to a cell variant where a cell contains three channels with fuel elements and one channel with targets. For this variant, the fuel burnup is -8 MW-days/kg. A large increase of the burnup, i.e., decrease of the amount of reprocessed targets, can be achieved by decreasing the minimum reactivity excess and also by changeing and increasing the complexity of the technology. For example, a large effect is expected from using combined fuel assemblies. In so doing, provisions must be made for performing complicated operation of disassembling highly active fuel assemblies consisting of fuel elements and targets.

Investigation of the properties of modified uranium dioxide	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								Experimental investigations have made it possible to develop a technology for obtaining uranium dioxide fuel pellets with anomalously high thermal conductivity at 600-800 degrees C and higher. The thermal conductivity of pellets is increased, without and with the addition of very small amounts of tin or titaniun dioxide, by improving the deposition process, making it possible to obtain simultaneously "large" particles and nanoparticles followed by annealing of the deposit at optimal temperature. It is pointed out that there is an analogy with the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity for single-crystal uranium dioxide. The radial heat flux method showed that the temperature gradient from the center to the periphery for modified pellets is approximately three times smaller than for pellets fabricated by the standard factory technology. The modified pellets contain uranium of different valence and have an unusual microstructure, characterized by the presence of close-packed grains. Small spherical pores 0.1-0.2 mu m in diameter are observed inside grains; a minimal number of polyhedral pores 1-2 mu m in size lie along the grain boundaries.

Investigation of radioactive contamination of graphite samples from the AM reactor	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The world's first nuclear power plant operated for almost 48 years. Over this period of time, the neutron fluence on the graphite masonry reached similar to 10(22) cm(-2), which resulted in activation of the impurities present in the graphite. During operation, incidents occurred with loss of seal and sometimes loss of integrity of the fuel-element claddings in some cells and particles of the fuel and steam-water mixture entered the graphite masonry. This resulted in radiation contamination with a complex radionuclide composition. Experimental information about the content and distribution of radionuclides in the spent nuclear graphite is needed in order to plan methods and periods of time for disassembly and salvaging of the graphite masonry of the stopped reactor taking account of the dose loads on the workers and the ecological safety norms. The problems which can be solved on the basis of the present work included the determination of the C-14 and H-3 contents by liquid-scintillation beta spectrometry, analysis of the actinide content by direct gamma spectrometry, and neutron-activation analysis followed by gamma spectrometry. These investigation yielded new data on the content of fission products and activation impurities in graphite.

Experimental investigation of the physical properties of salt melts containing sodium and lithium fluorides and beryllium difluoride	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								Experimental measurements of the basic physical properties of the melt NaF-LiF-BeF2 are presented as validation of the concept of a molten-salt reactor for burning actinides from spent fuel from light-water reactors. Compositions which are characterized by the minimal molar fraction LiF 15-17% and BeF2 25-27% and meet the special requirements for a fuel salt for the concept under study are found. The melts of the fluorides of three metals have an acceptable melting temperature (< 500 degrees C), permit dissolution of actinide and lanthanide trifluorides to molar fraction 2% and higher at 600 degrees C, possess good neutron-physical (even without enrichment with respect to Li-7) and thermophysical properties, are compatible with nickel-molybdenum alloys to temperature 750 degrees C, are inexpensive and are not strongly activated by neutrons so that they do not present a long-term disposal risk.

Recent activities and trends in the uranium market	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article								Implementing the large number of nuclear power plant projects worldwide presupposes a considerable increase in the production of natural uranium. Preparations have been made: Higher uranium prices stimulate investments into future mines and into uranium exploration. In some countries, the uranium industry is undergoing structural changes so as to be able to meet ftiture requirements. The terms and conditions laid down in long-term uranium supply contracts (prices and fixed delivery volumes) provide present and future producers with the necessary security in investing and planning. The electricity utilities have accepted the shift from a former "buyer's market" to a "seller's market" and adapted their uranium supply strategies accordingly. Numerous uranium mines, most of them small, with relatively low uranium ore concentrations, are under construction or in the commissioning phase. However, as secondary sources (fuels not made up of fresh uranium) are gradually coming to an end, many more uranium deposits need to be found and developed to commercial maturity in order to ensure uranium supply also on the long term. The steadily growing industries in the front end and the back end of the fuel cycle have intensified concerns about the non-proliferation of nuclear fuels. However, political considerations with respect to proliferation resistant uranium supply strategies have met with scepticism right from the outset.

The use of reprocessed fuel is established: More than 30 years of using MOX and ERU fuel assemblies in LWR	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								The optimum use of fuel has been an important goal for operating light water reactors all times. This is becoming more important by the price for natural uranium keeps rising. During the last 30 years, AREVA - in cooperation with its customers - has already made a noteable contribution to this by reprocessing depleted fuel assemblies and by recycling fuel. The plutonium extracted at reprocessing is returned to the fuel cycle as MOX fuel assemblies. By mid 2006 more than 4,000 MOX fuel assemblies were inserted into 35 European PWRs and more than 700 MOX fuel assemblies were loaded into 2 European BWRs. Apart from a frew exceptions all these fuel assemblies were designed and manufactured by AREVA. In 1986 Belgo-Nuclevire introduced the MIMAS Process for the manufacturing, a process which is still being used. MOX fuel assemblies present a high reliability, comparable to UO2 fuel assemblies. This also applies to the so-called ERU (Enriched Reprocessed Uranium) fuel assembly, being used for years to return uranium extracted at reprocessing back into the fuel cycle. By mid 2006 in total about 1,800 ERU fuel assemblies were loaded into 15 European PWRs in six different countries and more than 400 ERU fuel assemblies were loaded into 2 European BWRs in two different countries; all of which were designed by AREVA. The requested U-235 concentration was partly met by the usual process of enrichment during the gas-phase using centrifuges and partly by mixing the reprocessed uranium with medium- or highly enriched uranium. Regarding ERU, assemblies have reached a bumup of over 50 MWd/kgU. MOX fuel assemblies could even reach 60 MWd/kgHM in some cases.

The generation of denatured reactor plutonium by different options of the fuel cycle	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Workshop on Future Nuclear Systems and Fuel Cycles	SEP 01-02, 2005	Karlsruhe, GERMANY				WATER-REACTOR; NUCLEAR-FUEL; NP-237; THORIUM; PU-238	Denatured (proliferation resistant) reactor plutonium can be generated in a number of different fuel cycle options. First denatured reactor plutonium can be obtained if, instead of low enriched U-235 PWR fuel, re-enriched U-235/U-236 from reprocessed uranium is used (ftiel type A). Also the envisaged existing 2,500 t of reactor plutonium (being generated world wide up to the year 2010). mostly stored in intermediate fuel storage facilities at present, could be converted during a transition phase into denatured reactor plutonium by the options fuel type B and D. Denatured reactor plutonium could have the same safeguards standard as present low enriched (< 20% U-235) LWR fuel. It could be incinerated by recycling once or twice in PWRs and subsequently, by multi-recycling in FRs (CAPRA type or IFRs). Once denatured, such reactor plutonium could remain denatured during multiple recycling. In a PWR, e.g., denatured reactor plutonium could be destroyed at a rate of about 250 kg/GWey. While denatured reactor plutonium could be recycled and incinerated under relieved IAEA safeguards, neptunium would still have to be monitored by the IAEA in future for all cases in which considerable amounts of neptuniurn are produced.

International workshop on organizing the final storage of radioactive waste	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Editorial Material								On October 5 and 6, 2006, DBE TECHNOLOGY GmbH ran an international workshop in Peine about the establishment of organizations for final storage. The event was attended by representatives of the final storage organizations of seventeen European countries, the European Commission, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The starting points of this meeting were a number of projects, e.g., in the Czech Republic, in Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, and Russia, financed by the European Commission and supported in the development of national final storage programs and organizations by the organizations involved in final storage in Western Europe. The contributions by high-level representatives of European final storage organizations provided an excellent overview of the state of development reached in the respective countries. Positive as well as negative examples documented the immense importance of the appropriate types of organization in successfully coping with one of the biggest challenges our generation is facing in the nuclear field: finding solutions to the final storage problem.

Then, Ti-doped Nb3Sn conductors have been developed, and widely used for high-field generation. An increase of Sn concentration in the bronze produces an appreciable progress in the performance of bronze processed (Nb,Ti)(3)Sn conductors. Nb3Sn wires for an ac application have been also developed through the bronze process. New internal tin(IT) processed (Nb,Ti)3Sn conductors with modified cross-sectional configurations have been produced, which exhibit large J(c) in high fields as well as reduced ac loss. Both bronze processed and IT processed (Nb,Ti)3Sn conductors satisfy the ITER magnet specifications. As for new type Nb3Sn conductors, powder core and Jelly Roll processed (Nb,Ta)(3)Sn wires have been fabricated. Nb3Al wires with improved performance are prepared by rapid heating, quenching and transformation (RHQT) process. The quenched wire with bee crystal structure can be deformed after the Cu cladding, and finally reacted at 800 degrees C for the transformation. Recently, stable reel-to-reel RHQT operation has been performed on the wire over a long length. Meanwhile, V-based high-field A15 compounds such as V3Ga may need to be reconsidered for a fusion application, since they have much better radioactive characteristics than those of Nb-based A15 compounds.

However, J(c) property of MgB2 wire is insufficient for alternative material of Nb-based superconductor, and it is necessary to improve further Jc property. In order to improve Jc property, we tried to fabricate the several trace amounts of Cu addition MgB2/Fe-sheathed wires through PIT process using Mg2Cu as Cu addition source. T-c values of Cu addition samples were higher than those of non-Cu addition samples and they were improved with increasing amount of Cu addition.

Status of HELIAS reactor studies	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th International Toki Conference on Fusion and Advanced Technology	DEC 06-09, 2005	Toki, JAPAN			stellarator fusion reactor; power plant; blanket; maintenance; reactor physics	COIL SYSTEM; CONFINEMENT	In this paper an overview of the helical advanced stellarator (Helias) reactor studies is presented. The Helias reactor (HSR) is a reactor candidate of the optimized stellarator line, developed at the Max-Planck Institut fur Plasmaphysik, in Germany. It is an up-scaled version of the Wendelstein 7X, which accommodates a blanket and a shield and combines the modular coils with the optimized properties of the fusion plasma [T. Andreeva, C.D. Beidler, E. Harmeyer, Yu.L. Igitkhanov, Ya.I. Kolesnichenko, VV. Lutsenko, A. Shishkin, F. Hermegger, J. Ki ss linger, H. Wobig, The Helias reactor concept: comparative analysis of different field period configurations, Fusion Sci. Technol. 46 (2004) 395-400]. A compact reference version is HSR4/18 with 4-field periods and a 18 m major radius. HSR4/18 can stably operate at an average beta 4-5% and to deliver a fusion power of 3 GW. The design of the HSR demonstrates criteria of a safe and reliable route to ignition, a self-sustained burn without external heating, reliability of the technical components and the tritium breeding blanket. The coil system, the vacuum vessel and the shielding blanket are discussed. A more compact HSR3/15 configuration with 3-field periods and a 15 m major radius shows, however, a considerable amount of the bootstrap current and requires further optimization. A quasi-isodynamical configuration without transitional particle orbits was considered as an option, which confines almost 100% energetic particles. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Development of three-dimensional neutronics calculation system for design studies on helical reactor FFHR	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th International Toki Conference on Fusion and Advanced Technology	DEC 06-09, 2005	Toki City, JAPAN			helical reactor; neutronics; tritium breeding; neutron transport calculation	FLIBE BLANKET	Construction of a three-dimensional neutronics calculation system has been started for design studies on the helical reactor FFHR2. In the calculation system, geometry data of the helical structures are generated according to numerical equations for quick feedback between neutronics evaluation and design modification. The tritium breeding abilities of the FFITR2 with the Flibe + Be/JLF-1 (Reduced Activation Ferritic/Martensitic Steel) and the LiV-alloy blanket systems were investigated by using the calculation system. Since the original design could not achieve the tritium breeding ratios (TBRs) > 1.0 due to neutron leakage through opening between the blanket components, the dimensions have been modified to enhance the breeding ability. After the modification, the TBRs of 1.08 and 0.98 were obtained for the Flibe + Be/JLF-1 and UN-alloy blanket systems, respectively. The present results indicate that the blanket systems have potential to achieve adequate tritium breeding ability in the FFHR2 by further design optimization. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Possibility of tritium self-sufficiency in low aspect ratio tokamak reactor with the outboard blanket only	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th International Toki Conference on Fusion and Advanced Technology	DEC 06-09, 2005	Toki City, JAPAN			tritium breeding ratio; blanket; reflector; lead; beryllium; aspect ratio	SOLID BREEDER BLANKET; SUPERCRITICAL-WATER; FUSION-REACTORS; DESIGN; NUCLEAR; JAERI	The possibility of tritium self-sufficiency in a low aspect ratio (low-A) tokamak reactor with the outboard blanket only has been studied to simplify the inboard structure located in a high magnetic field. The tritium breeding ratio (TBR) of the outboard blanket increases by applying a neutron multiplier such as lead and beryllium to the inboard reflector. The effect in local TBR of a 40 cm thick inboard reflector of lead is about 40% that of the inboard breeding blanket. The local TBR of a reactor with both the lead inboard reflector and outboard blanket using a Li2O breeder and a beryllium multiplier can be larger than 1.35 for aspect ratios less than 2.9. The local TBR of 1.35 satisfies the net TBR requirement of 1.05 where there is 78% coverage of the breeding zone over the total plasma-facing surface area. The result indicates there is a design solution achieving tritium self-sufficiency even in a low-A tokamak reactor with the outboard breeding blanket only, using an appropriate inboard reflector. Be12Ti and Li2TiO3 are recommended from the viewpoint of safety. In the combination, the aspect ratio is required to be less than 1.35 to achieve local TBR of 1.35. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The ICC is operated under strong magnetic fields of a few tesla and it is one of the important potential methods for future devices with superconducting coils, such as ITER. The successful initiations of ICC in TEXTOR, Tore Supra, HT-7, AUG, W7-AS and JET using standard ICRF antennas demonstrate the feasibility of this alternative technique. In the large helical device (LHD), which is a current-less steady-state helical device with all superconducting coils, a new conditioning method, the ICC has been started in 2005. An initial experiment of long-term ICC during a strong magnetic field was successfully carried out in LHD. The removal rate depends on the wide energy distributions of high-energy particles accelerated by ICRF power, and controlling this distribution is also important. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, it is required that the behavior of tritium in the concrete materials be clarified to certify the radiation safety of a fusion reactor. The diffusion coefficient of hydrogen in cement paste is obtained by using the permeation experiment in this study, and it is found that the diffusion coefficient of hydrogen in the cement paste is only one order magnitude smaller than the diffusion coefficient of hydrogen in air. Calculation using the diffusion coefficient obtained in this study indicates that the gaseous tritium, HT or T-2, can permeate rather rapidly to the outside through the concrete wall of a, tritium-handling facility. This calculation implies that installation of a tritium recovery system with proper decontamination performance is required to minimize the tritium transfer to the outer environment.

Long-term activation and tritium generation of flowing lithium-lead under prolonged irradiation in fusion power plants	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						activation; tritium breeding; radioactive waste	INVENTORY; SYSTEMS; BLANKET; DESIGN	Lithium-lead is a candidate tritium-generating material in conceptual designs of magnetic fusion power plants.. Its prolonged utilization, ultimately during the entire lifetime of such a facility, has the potential to minimize amounts of active waste and improve the economic performance. Limits to a prolonged use are production of long-lived radioactive waste and depletion of lithium and reduction of the tritium production rate to levels where self-sufficiency is compromised. The methodology and calculations performed to estimate the transmutation of LiPb following its prolonged irradiation in two of the models in the European Power Plant Conceptual Study are presented. It is shown that no waste requiring permanent disposal is expected regardless of the irradiation length. Time-dependent tritium generation is discussed: Lithium replenishment seems unavoidable, but depletion rates are found to be lower than assumed in the design. The effect of the LiPb flow pattern in the irradiation history proves to be crucial in order to support these results.

J	Garrick, BJ				Garrick, B. John			Warren K. Sinclair keynote address: Contemporary issues in risk-informed decision making on the disposition of radioactive waste	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	41st Annual Meeting of the National-Council-on-Radiation-Protection-and-Measurements	MAR 30-31, 2005	Arlington, VA	Natl Council Radiat Protect & Measurement		National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements; waste management; waste, low level; regulations		A consistent and transparent risk-informed approach to managing nuclear waste is plagued with different regulators, different rules and regulations for different waste types, different compliance requirements, and indecisions about probabilistic vs. deterministic models. Low-activity waste management is particularly void of a path forward with respect to being risk-informed. Risk assessment is not referenced in the statutes on low-activity waste even though both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (U.S. NRC) have policies to apply consistent risk management approaches to all of their programs. The U.S. NRC has developed guidance on the preparation of probabilistic performance assessments for lowactivity waste facilities, but there have been no serious takers and a lack of initiative on the part of licensees. Thus, little to no experience exists on risk-informing low-activity waste. The missed opportunities include establishing a risk basis that would allow for simpler, safer, and much less costly alternatives for low-activity waste disposal while enabling society to have the full benefit of radiation technologies. There is hope that congressional action or regulatory rule making will address some of these issues with the result being the adoption of a more general and unified approach to risk-informed regulation of all types of waste. just as much of the initiative for risk-informed nuclear power came from industry, it must also be the case for nuclear waste. A start would be the adoption of a basic framework of risk assessment in waste management applicable to all types of waste-radioactive and nonradioactive. The "set of triplets" risk assessment framework that is applicable to any kind of risk is an established alternative. It is believed that such a framework with the support of a regulatory structure made compatible through appropriate rulemaking or congressional action, and the experience of the probabilistic performance assessments for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant and the proposed Yucca Mountain high-level waste repository, could result in the right path forward for the regulation and management of low-activity waste.

Improving the regulation and management of low-activity radioactive wastes	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	41st Annual Meeting of the National-Council-on-Radiation-Protection-and-Measurements	MAR 30-31, 2005	Arlington, VA	Natl Council Radiat Protect & Measurement		National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements; waste management; waste disposal; waste, low level	RECYCLED METALS; TRUST	This paper summarizes the first phase of a study in progress by a committee of the National Research Council's Board on Radioactive Waste Management. The Board initiated the study after observing that statutes and regulations administered by the federal and state agencies that control low-activity radioactive wastes have developed as a patchwork over almost 60 y. These controls usually reflect the enterprise or process that produced the waste rather than the waste's radiological hazard. Inconsistencies in the regulatory patchwork or its application may have led to overly restrictive controls for some low-activity wastes while others were neglected in comparison. In the first phase of this study, the committee reviewed current low-activity waste inventories, regulations, and management practices. This led the committee to develop five categories that encompass the spectrum of low-activity wastes and serve to illustrate gaps and inconsistencies in current regulations and management practices. The committee completed its first phase with four findings that will lead into the final phase of the study. This paper is excerpted from the committee's interim report that was issued in October 2003.

Risk-informed radioactive waste classification and reclassification	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	41st Annual Meeting of the National-Council-on-Radiation-Protection-and-Measurements	MAR 30-31, 2005	Arlington, VA	Natl Council Radiat Protect & Measurement		National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements; de minimis regulations; dose assessment; nuclear fuel cycle		Radio active waste classification systems have been developed to allow wastes having similar hazards to be grouped for purposes of storage, treatment, packaging, transportation, and/or disposal. As recommended in the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements' Report No. 139, Risk-Based Classification of Radioactive and Hazardous Chemical Wastes, a preferred classification system would be based primarily on the health risks to the public that arise from waste disposal and secondarily on other attributes such as the near-terni practicalities of managing a waste, i.e., the waste classification system would be risk informed. The current U.S. radioactive waste classification system is not risk informed because key definitions- especially that of high-level waste-are based on the source of the waste instead of its inherent characteristics related to risk. A second important reason for concluding the existing U.S. radioactive waste classification system is not risk informed is there are no general principles or provisions for exempting materials from being classified as radioactive waste which would then allow management without regard to its radioactivity. This paper elaborates the current system for classifying and reclassifying radioactive wastes in the United States, analyzes the extent to which the system is risk informed and the ramifications of its not being so, and provides observations on potential future direction of efforts to address shortcomings in the U.S. radioactive waste classification system as of 2004.

Managing the disposition of potentially radioactive scrap metal	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	41st Annual Meeting of the National-Council-on-Radiation-Protection-and-Measurements	MAR 30-31, 2005	Arlington, VA	Natl Council Radiat Protect & Measurement		National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements; waste management; waste, low-level; waste disposal		In 2002, the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) issued Report No. 141, Managing Potentially Radioactive Scrap Metal. The report evaluates management policy and related issues regarding scrap metal generated in regulated facilities that have been under radiological control or have radiological concerns. It has been estimated that more than 9 million metric tons of scrap metal of all types that have been associated with the production or use of radioactive materials will be generated during the coming decades at various facilities across the United States. Currently, disposition of such metal has encountered particular obstacles, primarily because of the lack of a consistent disposition policy, systematic regulatory provisions, and, above all, public understanding. Without clarity in the regulatory passage, much of the scrap metal, including metal that has not been contaminated, could be mischaracterized as low-level radioactive waste, resulting in a costly disposition operation. NOW Report No. 141 identifies this general category of metal as "potentially radioactive scrap metal" (PRSM) and discusses the viable disposition options for facilitating its management. Because much of the PRSM has been found to contain very low residual radioactivity or even none at all, one consideration is to release such metal outside of the radiological control framework. This would require the development and implementation of a set of strict release standards in the United States that would necessarily be risk-based and supported by a comprehensive management scheme. Developing a policy of this kind, however, would entail the resolution of many issues, not the least of which would be public acceptance, including that of the metal industry, of the possible recycling of PRSM in the general commerce.

J	Linsley, G				Linsley, Gordon			International standards related to the classification and deregulation of radioactive waste	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	41st Annual Meeting of the National-Council-on-Radiation-Protection-and-Measurements	MAR 30-31, 2005	Arlington, VA	Natl Council Radiat Protect & Measurement		National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements; waste management; regulations; standards		Although solid radioactive waste management is mainly a national concern, there are some aspects that have international implications. One important example is the decommissioning of nuclear facilities, which results in the release of materials that could be reused and recycled. It is possible that these materials could enter international trade, especially if the material is a metal. It is clearly desirable, therefore, to have appropriate international standards to help regulate trade. This paper describes recent international developments relating to the establishment of radiological criteria for the release of materials from regulatory control (clearance). There have already been some experiences of clearance and the transfer of recycled materials within Europe, and this paper reviews that experience. It also discusses recent developments in relation to the international classification of radioactive waste.		Linsley, G (reprint author), 23 Radley Rd, Abingdon OX14 3PL, Oxon, England.
