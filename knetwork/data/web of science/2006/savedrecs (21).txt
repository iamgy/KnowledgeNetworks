From the results obtained in the blanket mockups, it has been clarified that the C/Es of the integrated tritium production are 1.01-1.04 and 1.11-1.13 in the experiments without and with the neutron reflector, respectively. The tritium production can be very accurately predicted in the experiment without the reflector. In the mockups with the 12.6 and 25.2 mm thick tungsten armors, the integrated tritium productions are reduced by 3 and 6% relative to the case without the armor, respectively. Based on analysis of the integral experiment on the beryllium assembly, it is possible to conclude that the calculation uncertainty of the reaction rates in beryllium provides an acceptable agreement with the experimental data related to tritium breeding. Tritium techniques used for TPR measurements have been tested in the international benchmark experiment. There is a very good agreement within the estimated uncertainties between results obtained at JAERI and at TUD, though the results obtained at ENEA show an underestimation (about 15-20%) in comparison with FNS and TUD results.

In the present paper, the parameter dependence of Tritium Breeding Ratio (TBR) and neutron shield performance was examined for a Li blanket (FFHR-LV) and a Flibe blanket (FFHR-FV). The TBR was independent from the Flibe composition between 30 and 45 mol% of BeF2 in the case of the FFHR-FV. Due to the increase in the temperature range of the coolant Flibe as a result of the change of the structural materials from JLF-1 (low activation ferritic steel) to V-4Cr-4Ti, the fraction of BeF2 can be changed from 43 to 31 mol% without changing the margin to coagulation of Flibe. The compositional change of Flibe resulted in a significant decrease in its viscosity. The decrease of TBR by the effects of MHD insulator coating with Er was negligibly small with the expected doping level of Er in the FFHR-LV. The increase in the B4C in the shielding material resulted in the decrease in the fast neutron flux at the superconducting magnet by 60-70% in both FFHR-LV and FFHR-FV. Optimum neutronics performance for the two blanket systems was derived by the calculation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Neutron and photon flux spectra were measured in a thick tungsten assembly during irradiation with D-T neutrons. They were analysed with the Monte Carlo transport code MCNP-4C using nuclear data of the libraries FENDL-2, EFF-2.4 and JENDL-3.3. Small pieces of tungsten were irradiated with D-T neutrons, and the neutron-induced activities measured after the irradiation, were analysed with the inventory code FISPACT using data of the libraries EAF-2003 and FENDL/A-2. Deviations of experimental from calculated results show that an improvement of the tungsten data base is required. Tungsten is widely proposed for use in plasma facing components of future fusion devices. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, the design description, the performance analysis and the related ancillary systems for CH TBM are given. The key features of the design are based upon the breeder-outside-tube (BOT) concept, on the use of solid breeder ceramic material, of helium as coolant and tritium purge gas, of ferrite-martensite steel as structural material and of beryllium as neutron multiplier. Results show that the proposed TBM concept has the advantages of higher tritium breeding ratio (TBR), simple structure design and engineering feasibility. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Its capabilities, however, extend beyond this kind of assessments. Coupling of the different computational tools and nuclear databases to the same geometry and material compositions, automation of input file generation and post-processing subroutines enable self-consistent calculations and radial-poloidal analyses of several parameters of interest in fusion technology design, optimising time and computer resources. Results include 2D variations of the neutron flux distribution and energy spectra, material activation and related quantities, wall loading, nuclear primary heating, tritium and helium production and radiation damage rates to materials. The capabilities of the neutron transport module of HERCULES are presented here and benchmarked on the PPCS models. Results are consistent with values assumed in the design process or obtained through the more specific PPCS analyses: tritium generation ratios are in the range between 1.12 and 1.36, energy multiplication between 1.16 and 1.39, and average wall loads between 1.90 and 2.54 MWm(-2). Issues related to tritium breeding and possible tungsten first wall coating of the near-term models are discussed. (c) 2005 R. Pampin. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this manuscript neutronics analysis on CREST is presented based on the three-dimensional (313) model and calculations by MCNP/4C code and FENDU2.0 data library. The comparison among the results of tritium breeding ratio (TBR) for the one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D) and 3D calculations shows that the results are consistent with each other. The system would be tritium self-sufficient when considering the blanket coverage fraction, etc. and even some uncertainty. It has an energy multiplication of 1.38. The maximum neutron wall loading and maximum damage rate at the first wall (FW) are 6.30 MW/m(2) and 51.9 dpa/FPY, respectively. The FW material needs to be replaced every 3.8 years of operation with an availability of 75% if the neutron damage of ferritic steel is assumed to limit to 150 dpa. The total nuclear heat for TF coils is under the limit for TF coils in ITER case. The nuclear heat density for TF coils at the mid-plane is roughly the same as the limit for ITER.

The tritium production is mainly made by outboard blankets consisting of the self-cooled lithium lead (LiPb) as tritium breeding and neutron multiplying material, and the reduced activation ferritic steel F82H as structural material. The inboard blanket consisting of vanadium hydrate (VH2) and F82H as structural material plays the role of radiation shield for the TFCs. Adding Be layers to the LiPb layers effectively improves the TBR.

The design guidelines for the blanket are defined in order to meet the mission of the DEMO plant as mentioned above. Major design conditions are surface heat flux of 0.5 MW/m(2) with peaking factor of 2, a neutron wall load of 3.5 MW/m(2) with peaking factor of 1.5 and a neutron fluence of about 10MW/m(2). To moderate the technological extrapolation, reduced activation ferritic steel (F82H) structural material, Li2TiO3 and Be neutron multiplier are considered. To improve the economical aspect, supercritical water with inlet/outlet temperatures of 280/510 degrees C is chosen as coolant material, with coolant pressure of 25 MPa. As a result, a thermal efficiency of 41% is achieved. To obtain higher plasma performance, MHD instabilities suppressing shell structure is adopted with structural compatibility to the blanket structure. To meet higher plant availability requirements (more than 75%), the hot cell maintenance approach is selected for the replaceable power core components. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

FEM calculations for the neutron wall loading of 1.5 MW/m(2) show that the temperature of the STB armor tile can be kept below 2000K by optimizing the first metal wall thickness. The heat load experiment on the STB armor mockup confirms feasibility of the temperature control and mechanical joining. Degradation of STB armor tiles due to neutron irradiation requires replacement of them every few years by means of remote handling "screw coasters" using helical winding, where the replaced tiles are low level wastes. Although the STB concept is feasible within nuclear and thermal properties, more detailed structural optimization is needed including the mechanical and chemical properties. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Interaction of the hot Be dust with water in the case of a water leak will produce hydrogen. In such conditions air leaks can lead to hydrogen or dust explosions. The explosions could damage the machine and would present a danger to the public if the release of radioactivity from the vacuum vessel were not otherwise mitigated. Current ITER strategy to cope with the danger of dust/hydrogen explosions is based on administrative limits on accumulation of dust inside the ITER vacuum vessel. We are investigating a different approach based on active prevention measures - injections of an inert gas (CO2) in the vacuum vessel in case of detection of air leaks. Analysis done with the code MELCOR shows that injection of CO2 in the vacuum vessel may prevent the explosions. However, a detailed analysis Of O-2/CO2/H-2 space distributions and some experiments will be needed before a decision is made to base ITER safety on this approach. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We propose a novel strategy to eliminate (or minimize) the HLW generated by fusion systems. The main source of the fusion HLW includes the structural and recycled materials, refractory metals, and liquid breeders. The basic idea involves recycling and reprocessing the waste, separating the long-lived radionuclides from the bulk low-level waste, and irradiating the limited amount of HLW in a specially designed module to transmute the long-lived products into short-lived radioisotopes or preferably, stable elements. The potential performance of the new concept seems promising. Our analysis indicated moderate to excellent transmutation rates could be achieved in advanced fusion designs. Successive irradiation should burn the majority of the HLW. The figures of merit for the concept relate to the HLW burn-up fraction, neutron economy, and impact on tritium breeding. Hopefully, the added design requirements could be accommodated easily in fusion power plants and the cost of the proposed system would be much less than disposal in a deep geological HLW repository. Overall, this innovative approach offers benefits to fusion systems and helps earn public acceptance for fusion as a HLW-free source of clean nuclear energy. Published by Elsevier B.V.

To date, researchers have focused on the MHD resistance, compatibility, adherence, thermodynamic, and interface issues, paying little attention to the nuclear concerns. This assessment examines the nuclear-related issues for the leading coatings proposed for the self-healing approach in particular. Specifically, we assessed the impact of the coating additives to Li on the breeding potential of a typical Li/V system. An important outcome of this study has been to identify the coatings that compromise the breeding and rank the remaining candidates based on their nuclear behavior using the ARIES-RS operating conditions. It appears likely that the nuclear requirements will have an important impact on the choice of the coating material and on the maximum coating concentration in Li. Potential solutions that mitigate the effect of coatings and compensate for the breeding losses are discussed in the paper. However, these solutions introduce additional requirements and concerns that must be considered in future studies. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The results have been compared with the design guidelines for loss of tritium into the components or coolant for tritium accountancy (1.4 kg/y) and tritium concentration in the coolant (0.37 GBq/cm(3)) for DEMO(J05). The results revealed that tritium concentration and inventory in the coolant attributed to permeation from the blanket (plasma facing first wall and breeding region) is expected to be much higher both of these guidelines unless designated permeation barriers are used. Therefore, permeation must be reduced by a factor of 100 in order to satisfy the guidelines.

The high-level tritiated water decomposes by itself and generates mainly hydrogen, becoming tritiated hydrogen peroxide water. In order to summarize safety requirements for long-term storage of high-level tritiated water, the characteristics, such as effective G-values of hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide, pH and Oxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP), have been investigated by storing tritiated water from 5 TBq/m(3) to 2 EBq/m(3) for 5 years. Because the effective G-value of hydrogen increases with decreasing tritium concentration, the storage tank for a wider range of tritium concentrations requires not only depression but, also, adequate processing of the cover gases. High-level tritiated water of more than 1 PBq/m(3) was acid and in some cases was in a corrosive condition; these characteristics have been maintained for 5 years. Therefore, the ORP-pH situation should be monitored periodically to avoid the corrosive condition. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Various methods were explored for attaching the platinum electrodes. Hydrogen enrichment characteristics of the simulated tritium monitoring system were investigated at 923 K and 2 V in a wet argon atmosphere with 19.5% oxygen concentration. Among all the electrodes tested, the maximum hydrogen evolution rate at the cathode was obtained by employing a pasted electrode and a plated electrode with a gold mesh as the anode and cathode, respectively. An evaluation of the hydrogen enrichment indicates that hydrogen could be enriched in a closed loop system of the simulated tritium monitor. The enrichment of hydrogen was found to be satisfactory. Based on these experimental results, the required electrode area for the proposed tritium monitor system was estimated to be 75 cm(2). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The major chemical forms of atmospheric tritium are water, hydrogen and methane. We present an automatic sequential process for measuring each of these chemical forms, allowing reliable operation and saving much labor time. Water vapor is collected easily in a molecular sieve. The sampling method for hydrogen or methane is to oxidize the gas into water using a catalyst and to absorb the water in a molecular sieve. For hydrogen oxidization a Pt catalyst with an Al-Cr-Fe metal honeycomb is used because it is expected to have a small pressure drop and little memory effect from tritium contamination. For methane oxidization, a conventional Pd alumina catalyst is used. After sampling atmospheric tritium for a week, the water is recovered from the molecular sieves. The tritium concentration in the recovered water is measured with a low background liquid scintillation counter. The atmospheric tritium concentrations obtained by the automatic sampling system are consistent with the data of a manual sampling system. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, liquid Li and Flibe molten salt are chosen as the blanket coolants. For the Li blanket system, there exists some possibility to overcome MHD problem by using three-surface coated channel with multi-layer structure. The material properties in terms of electrical conductivity required for the innermost metal layer seems achievable together with new concept that the coated material works as the structural component of the innermost thin layer. In the case of Flibe coolant, which shows very small MHD pressure drop, electrolysis occurs to result in generation of fluorine and tritium. The numerical results show that this electrolysis can be suppressed by optimizing the channel geometry. Numerical and experimental results indicate that heat transfer enhancement using pebble beds is expected when the flow velocity is relatively small to reduce the MHD effect. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Part of the collaborative research centers on studies of the molten salt 2LiF(2)-BeF2, (also known as Flibe) for fusion applications. Flibe has been proposed as a self-cooled breeder in both magnetic and inertial fusion power plant designs over the last 25 years. The key feasibility issues associated with the use of Flibe are the corrosion of structural material by the molten salt, tritium behavior and control in the molten salt blanket system, and safe handling practices and releases from Flibe during an accidental spill. These issues are all being addressed under the JUPITER-II program at the Idaho National Laboratory in the Safety and Tritium Applied Research (STAR) facility. In this paper, we review the program to date in the area of tritiun/deuterium behavior, Flibe mobilization under accident conditions and testing of Be as a redox agent to control corrosion. Future activities planned through the end of the collaboration are also presented. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Up to now, experiments have been carried out at neutron generators producing mono-energetic 14 MeV neutrons and using experimental assemblies simulating reactor-like neutron flux spectra. Since in October 2003 a Tritium Trace Experiment (TTE) was performed at JET, two samples of EUROFER-97 were exposed to the real DT neutron source produced in the tokamak. The goal was to measure the activity induced by neutrons in this material and to compare it to that calculated using the European Activation System EASY-2003 with FENDL-2/A neutron activation cross-section library. This was the first attempt to compare experimental data obtained in a real DT neutron spectrum with calculation results. The conclusion of this work is that the EASY code and the FENDL-2/A can evaluate the induced activity of medium half-life isotopes with an acceptable uncertainty, within the experimental total error.

First results of feasibility studies have shown that specific lines of metallic impurities can be used to discriminate co-deposited layer from substrate (graphite). By recording these lines shot by shot, it is possible to follow in real-time co-deposited layer removal and to evaluate co-deposited layer thickness. It is also possible to evaluate, with this technique, impurity profiles versus depth. Furthermore, an hydrogen line has been recorded during the last experiments, indicating that such a technique could be implemented in situ, in a tokamak, to localise and quantify tritium retention.

This has led to the production of the European Activation System (EASY), which provides such a capability. The version used here, EASY-2003, is widely distributed and has been used to carry out activation calculations on a large number of materials. However, there was also a need for a comprehensive handbook of activation data that could be quickly referred to, rather than resorting to running codes. This paper discusses the process of generating, over a period of 8 months, the data for a handbook that presents the important activation data for all the naturally occurring elements from hydrogen to uranium. The main computational methods are outlined briefly, but the bulk of the paper is focused toward a description of the different ways in which the data are presented, including new presentations of activation data, called 'importance diagrams'.

The TBM has a toroidal width of 73 cm, a radial depth of 60 cm and a poloidal height of 91 cm. The ceramic breeder is made of Li4SiO4 with 75% Li-6 enrichment (60% packing factor) and beryllium is used as the multiplier. The two sub-modules are arranged in two configurations, namely a layered configuration and an edge-on configuration. In the present work, we analyze these two sub-modules using two-dimensional discrete ordinates transport codes in R-theta model that accounts for the presence of the ITER shielding blanket and the surrounding frame of the port. The objectives are: (1) to examine the profiles of heating and tritium production rates in the two sub-modules, both in the radial and toroidal direction, in order to identify locations where neutronics measurements can be best performed with least perturbation from the surroundings, (2) to provide both local and integrated values for nuclear heating rates required for subsequent thermo-mechanics analysis, and (3) to compare the tritium production capabilities of two variants for the HCPB blanket concept, mainly the parallel and the edge-on configurations. We present the main findings from this study in this paper. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

A computer code ACT4, which had been developed to calculate radioactivity, decay heat and gamma ray source for fusion reactors was supplemented an ability to deal with the reactions. Experiments conducted with Fusion Neutronics Source in Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute for the radioactivity by sequential charged particle reactions were analyzed with the newly revised code of ACT4. As the result, the activations via sequential reaction in LiF showed reasonable agreement with experimental data, which means that the ACT4 program will work well. However, the other activations in vanadium and low activation ferritic steel did not. The disagreement must be caused by incorrectness in neutron cross sections, charged particle cross sections, charged particle emission spectra, etc., and they need to be fully reviewed for the detailed and reliable design analysis of fusion reactors.

Increases of leukemia and of solid cancers with radiation dose have been noted in the population of about 30,000 people who lived in the settlements downstream of the site of the radioactive releases; that population has been studied for several decades by Russian scientists, notably in the framework of cooperation with American and European scientists. The radiation doses are currently estimated by means of the Techa River Dosimetry System-2000 (TRDS-2000). Recently, a scientist from Mayak PA has suggested in several publications that the doses calculated using TRDS-2000 might be underestimated substantially. A special international Workshop, held in Moscow on 8-10 December 2003, aimed to resolve some of the pressing issues related to the determination of the external and internal doses received by the Techa River population and to give recommendations on the further development of methodologies used for dose reconstruction. The authors of this article were selected by the organizers of the Workshop to draw the conclusions of the meeting. They express the view that, while the dose reconstruction system TRDS-2000 is basically sound, additional work is needed and the results of any epidemiological studies making use of TRDS-2000 should be qualified as preliminary, pending resolution of several issues. The most important of these issues is the re-evaluation of the activities released, using additional information that could be obtained with the help of Mayak experts. Other specific suggestions aiming to improve the dose reconstruction methodology for the Techa River cohort, i.e., continued measurements of accumulated dose in environmental samples and human tissues, validation of external dose estimates with thermoluminescence measurements of bricks and with electron paramagnetic resonance measurements of teeth, estimation of individual doses instead of group doses, detailed account of the contributions to dose of medical examinations and of other releases from the Mayak complex, and careful assessment of the uncertainties, were made by the meeting participants.

J	Fritsch, P				Fritsch, P			Uncertainties in aerosol deposition within the respiratory tract using the ICRP 66 model: A study in workers	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						lungs, human; modeling, biological factors; plutonium; aerosols	PARAMETER UNCERTAINTIES; (PUO2)-PU-239; PARTICLES; RISK	This study estimates uncertainties in aerosol deposition within the main regions of the human respiratory tract calculated using the ICRP 66 model. Uniform, triangular, normal, or lognormal distributions were assigned to the model parameters, which involve physical properties of aerosols, their inhalability, their thermo- and aerodynamic deposition efficiencies, and the anatomy, physiology, and exertion level of the individuals. Calculations were performed over a range of aerosol sizes from 0.01 to 50 mu m. Monodispersed aerosols were characterized by their aerodynamic diameter (d(ue)). Polydispersed aerosols were characterized by their activity median aerodynamic diameters (AMADs) and the geometric standard deviation (GSD) in diameter. Lognormal distributions of particle deposition were generally observed with low GSD (< 2). The highest uncertainties were observed within the deep lung for the smallest and the largest aerosol sizes, which were mainly due either to particle density or to aerodynamic deposition efficiencies and anatomical and physiological variability, respectively. In the case of diameters larger than 5 mu m, uncertainties in the deep lung deposition were much more important for monodispersed than for polydispersed aerosols. This was explained both by the size distribution of the deposited aerosol, the median of which corresponded to a maximal d(ue) value of about 7 and 5 in bronchioles and alveoli, respectively, and by the absence of deposition, which occurs for d(ue) equal to or larger than 50 mu m, depending on the exertion level. Thus, in the range of AMADs considered, for the four default workers proposed by ICRP 66, uncertainties in aerosol deposition remain low, with GSD smaller than 3.

There is a need to quantify such exposure, with the possibility that the testing may post-date exposure by months or years. Therefore, it is important to develop a very sensitive test to measure precisely the isotopic composition of uranium in urine at low levels of concentration. The results of an interlaboratory comparison using sector field (SIF)-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and multiple collector (MC-ICP-MS for the measurement of uranium concentration and U-235/U-238 and U-236/U-231 isotopic ratios of human urine samples are presented. Three urine samples were verified to contain uranium at 1-5 ng L-1 and shown to have natural uranium isotopic composition. Portions of these urine batches were doped with depleted uranium (DU) containing small quantities of U-236, and the solutions were split into 100 mL and 400 mL aliquots that were subsequently measured blind by three laboratories. All methods investigated were able to measure accura tely U-238/U-235 With precisions of similar to 0.5% to similar to 4%, but only selected MC-ICP-MS methods were capable of consistently analyzi ng U-236/U-238 to reasonable precision at the similar to 20 fg L-1 level of U-236 abundance. Isotope dilution using a U-233 tracer demonstrates the ability to measure concentrations to better than +/- 4% with the MC-ICP-MS method, though sample heterogeneity in urine samples was shown to be problematic in some cases. MC-ICP-MS outperformed SF-ICP-MS methods, as was expected. The MC-ICP-MS methodology described is capable of measuring to similar to 1 % precision the U-238/U-235 of any sample of human urine over the entire range of uranium abundance down to < 1 Ing L-1, and detecting very small amounts of DU contained therein.

These data were compiled to form reference models that could be used for dose calculation in humans. In case of protracted exposure, the same models are applied, assuming that they are not modified by the duration of exposure. This work aims at testing this hypothesis. It presents new experimental data on retention of uranium after chronic intake, which are compared to values calculated from a biokinetic model that is based on experiments of acute exposure of rats to uranium. Experiments were performed with 56 male Sprague Dawley rats, from which 35 were exposed during their whole adult life to 40 mg L-1 of uranyl nitrate dissolved in mineral water and 21 were kept as controls. Animals were euthanatized at 32, 95, 186, 312, 368, and 570 d after the beginning of contamination. Urine and all tissues were removed, weighted, mineralized, and then analyzed for uranium content by Kinetics Phosphorescence Analysis (KPA) or by ICP-MS. Experimental data showed that uranium accumulated in most organs, following a nonmonotonous pattern. Peaks of activities were observed at 1-3, 10, and 19 mo after the beginning of exposure. Additionally, accumulation was shown to occur in tissues such as teeth and brain that are not usually described as target organs. Comparison with model prediction showed that the accumulation of uranium in target organs after chronic exposure is overestimated by the use of a model designed for acute exposure. These differences indicate that protracted exposure to uranium may induce changes in biokinetic parameters when compared to acute contamination and that calculation of dose resulting from chronic intake of radionuclides may need specific models that are not currently available.

J	Kramer, GH; Hauck, BM				Kramer, GH; Hauck, BM			The sliced BOMAB phantom: A new variant for intercomparison	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						bioassay; calibration; phantom; whole body counting	CALIBRATION; RADIOACTIVITY; PROGRAM	Previously, this laboratory conceptualized a new phantom for calibration or performance testing of whole body counters using Monte Carlo simulations. This paper describes the physical reality that was created from the Monte Carlo design project and compares its counting efficiency to that of a conventional BOMAB phantom using two whole body counters. In one counter (NaI based) the agreement between the two phantoms was +/- 8% and in the second counter (Ge based) the agreement was +/- 5% at all the energies measured (126 keV, 661 keV, 1172 keV, 1330 keV). The advantage of the sliced phantom is that the sources are solid, sealed, and cannot leak activity thereby simplifying packing for shipment if the phantom is classified as a Dangerous Good. The new phantom is, therefore, ideal for uses that involve shipment, such as an intercomparison exercise. The phantom is also re-usable as the sources can be changed.

Minimum detectable activity concentrations of U-238, U-234, Pu-239, and Pu-238 in outdoor air are calculated for two direct alpha spectrometry methods: continuous air monitoring is compared with separate sampling and subsequent alpha particle counting in a vacuum chamber. The radon progeny activity concentration typical for outdoor air and the effects for the alpha particle spectra caused by the properties of the filter and the aerosol particles are taken into account using measurements and Monte Carlo simulations. Continuous air monitoring is a faster method for identifying the presence of (trans)uranium elements when their activity concentration is considerably higher than the typical detection limit. Separate sampling and counting in a vacuum chamber is a more sensitive method,when concentrations are close to the detection limit and when the duration of the sampling-counting cycle is greater than approximately 2 h. The method may serve as a tool for rapid field measurements.

The mill was permanently shut down in 2001 when the Dawn Mining Company radioactive materials license was amended to allow direct disposal of water treatment sludge to a tailings disposal area at the mill. The mill building was demolished in 2003. Site soil characterization took place in 2004. Soil cleanup is ongoing. Contaminated soils oil the site were characterized using a GPS-based gamma scanning system. A correlation between shielded gamma exposure rate and concentration of Ra-226 in surface soils was developed. Subsurface soils were sampled using backhoe trenches. This system proved efficient and accurate in guiding development of the remedial action planning for the site and subsequent soil cleanup.

As part of a Department of Energy and BNL effort to reduce the radiological inventory, the WBNIF was identified as having no future use. In order to deactivate the facility and eliminate the need for nuclear safety management and long-term surveillance, it was decided to remove the neutron sources and dismantle the facility. In addition, the sources did not have DOT Special Form documentation so they would need to be encapsulated once removed for offsite storage or disposal.

The AS-NEC method uses prompts, delayed events and detector dead-time of a single reference PET scan to calculate-the full shape of the NEC curve. The method was implemented using a 3D decay series of the 70 cm NEMA 2001 (line source in a 20 cm diameter solid polyethylene cylinder) phantom and validated with the cylindrical NEMA 1994 (diameter, 20 cm; length, 20 cm) and NEMA 2001 IEC body phantoms. The NEC curves generated by the single frames of the phantom series, using the AS-NEC method, well correlated with the experimental NEC curves proving the validity of the method and the possible application to clinical studies. The AS-NEC model was then retrospectively applied on 40 3D 18 F-FDG WB studies in a range of body mass index (BMI) between 16 and 30 (kg/m(2)) (6 under-weight (uw), 18 normal-weight (nw), 16 over-weight (ow)). For each acquisition frame of each patient study, the activity at the acquisition time, corresponding to the NEC-p was identified on the NEC curves. Furthermore, as the NEC curves show a region around the NEC-p with small variations (nearly a plateau), the values of radioactivity corresponding to a reduction of 1%, 3% and 5% with respect to NEC-p were also calculated to assess a possible reduction of the doses to be injected in clinical studies. The results show that the average activities at the acquisition time corresponding to the NEC-p were comparable for the three BMI classes: 336.7 MBq (sd = 22.2), 329.3 MBq (sd = 33.3), 344.1 MBq (sd = 48.1) for uw, nw and ow, respectively. Therefore, the total average NEC-p activity for the three BMI classes was 336.7 MBq (sd = 40.7). The mean values of the radioactivity at a reduction of 1%, 3% and 5% with respect to the NEC-p were: 284.9 MBq (sd = 40.7), 247.9 MBq (sd = 33.3) and 225.7 MBq (sd = 29.6) respectively. These results indicate the possibility to use, for the Discovery-ST, a single injection protocol of 448 MBq (for the range of BMI here considered) to have an activity at the acquisition time (after 45 min of uptake) of 336.7 MBq (NEC-p). Nevertheless, the plateau near the NEC-p suggests the possibility to reduce significantly the dose to be injected in clinical studies down to about 330 MBq, while preserving suitable NEC performance (-3%) with respect to the NEC-p. This result was supported by image quality assessment performed on reconstructed images of the NEMA 2001 IEC body phantom.

In addition to an intense line at 159 keV, the decay scheme of this radioisotope includes a low yield (similar to 3%) of higher energy photons which make a non-negligible contribution to the final image when low-energy high-resolution (LEHR) collimators are used. This contribution of high-energy photons may reach similar to 28% of the total counts in the projections. The aim of this work is to model each energy component of the high-energy Point Spread Function (hPSF) for fan-beam LEHR collimators in order to develop fast Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of high-energy ray contamination. The modeling of hPSF was based on the results of simulating photons through the collimator-detector system using the MC code PENELOPE. Since low-energy PSFs models for fan-beam collimators tend to a Gaussian distribution, we use the same function for the hPSF modeling for high-energy photons. The parameters of these Gaussian functions (g(x, y)) were obtained by minimizing the root mean square error (RMS) using the sensitivity of the simulated hPSFs as a constraint. The hPSFs were parameterized for a range of energies between 350 keV and 538 keV. The RMS attained after fitting of g (x, y) to the simulated hPSFs was always smaller than similar to 2% of the mean sensitivity per pixel of the image. A strong dependence of the sensitivity on the type and thickness of the backscatter material behind the crystal was found. Our results indicate that Gaussian distributions approximate the hPSF responses for fan-beam collimators. This model will be an important tool to accelerate MC simulations of radiolabeled compounds which emit medium- or high-energy rays.

J	Vela, O; de Burgos, E; Perez, JM				Vela, O; de Burgos, E; Perez, JM			Dose rate assessment in complex geometries	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						dose rate calculation; point kernel; three-dimensional (3-D) modeling		A code developed for calculating dose rate maps inscenarios with complex geometries and gamma radiation sources is presented in this work. It is based on the point kernel method. The code computes photon flux and dose rate in preselected positions due to volumetric radioactive sources in the presence of other, nonemitting materials acting as shielding. Buildup factors are considered to account for radiation scattering effects, using the Geometric-Progression formula in the fitting function. The major advantage of this code is that there are no constraints for the generation of geometries. Any type and number of volumes can be loaded to generate the scenario by using standard three-dimensional computer-aided design tools. The geometry is imported as a DXF format file. In a second step, material and radiometric attributes are imported for each volume. Volumetric radioactive sources are represented by a set of single emitting point sources distributed within its geometry. The code output has been verified in three different ways: by comparing with results from other point-kernel packages, by comparing with estimates obtained with a Monte Carlo code, and by contrasting with direct experimental measurements. Results of these comparisons are presented and discussed. Finally, intrinsic limitations of the code are discussed.

J	Ziebik, A; Stanek, W				Ziebik, A; Stanek, W			Energy and exergy system analysis of thermal improvements of blast-furnace plants	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH			English	Article						system analysis; blast-furnace plant; Cowper-stoves; input-output mathematical model; exergy losses; cumulative energy and exergy consumption		The blast-furnace process dominating in the production of steel all over the world is still continuously improved due to its effectiveness (exergy efficiency is about 70%). The thermal improvement consist in all increase of the temperature of the blast and its oxygen enrichment, as well as the injection of cheaper auxiliary fuels. The main aim is to save coke because its consumption is the predominating item of the input energy both in the blast-furnace plant and in ironworks. Besides coke also other energy carriers undergo changes, like the consumption of blast, production of the chemical energy of blast-furnace gas, its consumption in Cowper-stoves and by other consumers, as well as the production of electricity in the recovery turbine. These changes affect the whole energy management of ironworks due to the close connections between energy and technological processes. That means the production of steam, electricity.. compressed air, tonnage oxygen, industrial water, feed water undergo changes as well. In order to determine the system changes inside the ironworks a mathematical model of the energy management of the industrial plant was applied. The results of calculations of the supply of energy carriers to ironworks can then be used to determine the cumulative energy and exergy consumption basing on average values of cumulative energy and exergy indices concerning the whole country. Such a model was also used in the system analysis of exergy losses. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The use of urania-plutonia solid solutions in PFBR calls for accurate measurement f physicochemical properties of these materials. Hence, in the present study, oxygen potentials of (U1-yPuy)O2-x, with y = 0.21 and 0.28 were measured over the temperature range 1073-1473 K covering an oxygen potential range of -550 to -300 kJ mol(-1) (O/M ratio from 1.96 to 2.000) by employing a H-2/H2O gas equilibration technique followed by solid electrolyte EMFmeasurement. (U1-yPuy)O2-x, with y = 0.40 is being used in the Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR) in India to test the behaviour of fuels with high plutonium content. However, data on the oxygen potential as well as thermal conductivity of the mixed oxides with high plutonium content are scanty. Hence, the thermal diffusivity of (U1-yPuy)O-2, with y = 0.21, 0.28 and 0.40 was measured and the results of the measurements are reported. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ikegami, T				Ikegami, T			Compound process fuel cycle concept and core characteristics	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						fuel cycle; fast reactor core; LWR spent fuel; simple dry pyrochemical processing; reduction of environmental burden; efficient utilization of nuclear fuel resources; enhancement of nuclear noll-proliferation		A new fuel cycle concept is proposed in which spent fuels of light water reactor are multi-recycled in a fast reactor core without ordinary reprocessing process but with only simple dry pyrochemical processing. Feasibility of the concept has been studied focusing on the core nuclear characteristics adopting radial heterogeneous core configuration in which both recycled light water spent fuels and fast reactor fuels are loaded. Results of the core survey analyses show that four to six time recycling of light water reactor spent fuels with the burn-up of 300 to 400 GWd/t can be achieved with almost no increase of minor actinide content. Such benefits will be expected in this concept, though further research and development efforts are required, as efficient utilization of nuclear fuel resources, enhancement of nuclear non-proliferation due to the fact that all actinides are recycled all together in a lumped state together with the fact that the concept has no radial blanket fuels which contain high fissile plutonium ratio, besides the possibilities of reduction of environmental impacts due to reduced high level waste, reduction of fuel cycle cost through simplified reprocessing procedure, and suppression of light water reactor spent fuel pile-up.

Consequently for regions (like fuel or control rods) Will) Strong flux gradients a fine computational mesh becomes required for better accuracy of the predictions. In the case of a PWR assembly, this situation particularly occurs with Gadolinia fuel (UO2-Gd2O3) or Erbia fuel (UO2-Er2O3) rods. The aim of this Study is to determine, for UO2-Gd2O3 UO2-Er2O3 pins, the optinial number Of computational fuel mesh rings that preserves good accuracy and at the same time is consuming minimum computational running time. This Study will be carried out using PARAGON lattice physics code. PARAGON is a two-dimensional neutron/gamma transport code used mainly to generate the group Constants for core simulator codes Such as ANC. PARAGON (with its new module SDDM) can treat the multi-region resonance self-shielding effect for all resonant isotopes in the fuel rods micro-regions including Gd spatial concentration variation due to burnup depletion. Willi this capability, PARAGON does not use the pre-tabulated Gd effective cross-sections that are usually generated with a super-cell calculation model. The power distribution used during the fuel integrity evaluation of the fuel rods with burnable absorbers will be also discussed in this paper. By comparing the power profiles of UO2 and absorber rods, it is found that the UO2 values are more limiting and consequently they can be used for conservative evaluations.

The results are compared with the conventional method, where only one set of the microscopic group cross-sections is employed, to investigate the effects of space-dependency of the microscopic group cross-sections and feasibility of the old method. The differences of the effective neutron Multiplication factor, burning region moving speed, Spent fuel burnup and spatial distributions of nuclide densities, neutron fluence and power density may be considerable from the reactor designer point. However, they are;mail enough When we study about the characteristics of CANDLE burnup for different designs.

In this study, EBW (Electron Beam Welding), it typical application of high energy density beams widely used in various industries, was examined for its applicability to sealing a carbon steel overpack lid with a thickness of 190 mm. Welding conditions and welding parameters were examined for single-pass welding in a narrow area for three different penetration depths. Weld joint tests including macro- and microstructure, and mechanical properties were conducted and assessed within tentatively applied criteria for weld joints. Measurement and numerical calculation for residual stress were also conducted and the tendency of residual stress distribution wits discussed. These test results were compared with the basic requirements of the welding method for overpack, which were pointed out in our first report. The induced void and cold shut inside the weld joint and surface roughness were also discussed for their improvement and evaluation, which need to be established to assure the long-term integrity of overpack lid closure.

J	Hakim, MA; Hamadouche, M				Hakim, MA; Hamadouche, M			Development of a supporting tool for optimal fuel management in research reactors using artificial neural networks	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							OPTIMIZATION	The present work investigates an appropriate way to solve the problem of optimizing fuel management in research reactors. A computer program has been developed, to automate this procedure. The program suggests an optimal core configuration, which satisfies to established safety constraints. The suggested solution was based upon the use of coupled methods in which a stochastic technique, simulated annealing, and an adaptive back-propagation neural network are connected to each other. An objective function was developed based on two performance parameters: cycle length. which can be determined through the evaluation of the effective multiplication factor K-eff and power peaking factor P-max. The system uses optimization of these two parameters to finds configurations in which K-eff is maximized, whether a penalty function is applied to limit the value of P-max which should be lower than the one given in the initial configuration. A series of tests have been performed using a modified core configuration of the benchmark 10 MW 1AEA LEU (low enriched uranium) research reactor and the result achieved is the optimum configuration of the studied core.
