In the first one, lithium containing ceramics is used for tritium breeding, helium is used as a coolant and purge gas for tritium extraction, beryllium-as a multiplier. Ferritic steel is a structure material. In the second one lithium is used as tritium breeder and a coolant, and vanadium alloy of V-Cr-Ti system as a structure material. Conceptual designs of both TBMs and ancillary systems for their tests in ITER, strategy of tests, key R&D issues for both concepts are summarized. An international collaboration in R&D, development and testing of TBMs is of great importance due to shortage of testing space in ITER and due to high cost of the program. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Reduced activation ferritic steel (RAFS) is used as the structural material. Helium is used to cool the first wall and blanket structure, and the self-cooled breeder Pb-17Li is circulated for power conversion and for tritium breeding. A SiCf/SiC composite insert is used as the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) insulation to reduce the impact from the MHD pressure drop of the circulating Pb-17Li and as the thermal insulator to separate the high temperature Pb-17Li from the helium cooled RAFS structure. For the reference tokamak power reactor design, this blanket concept has the potential of satisfying the design limits of RAFS while allowing the feasibility of having a high Pb-17Li outlet temperature of 700 degrees C. We have identified critical issues for the concept, some of which include the first wall design, the assessment of MHD effects with the SiC-composite flow coolant insert, and the extraction and control of the bred tritium from the Pb-17Li breeder. R&D programs have been proposed to address these issues. At the same time we have proposed a test plan for the DCLL ITER-Test Blanket Module program. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The main design rational and characteristics of the PPCS model AB as well as the main assumption and achieved results are reported. The reactor is able to supply to the grid a net electrical power of 1.5 GW(e) for a fusion power of 4.2 GW(th) and features a major radius of 9.56 m. A tritium breeding ratio (TBR) of 1.13 will assure the tritium self sufficiency. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The two experimental works were carried out under the collaboration work of JUPITER-H. To maintain Flibe in the blanket loop under reduction condition is a key issue to transform TF to T-2 with a fast reaction rate. In order to achieve that, proper rates of Be dissolution and reduction reaction of TF to T2 in Flibe have to be established in the self-cooled blanket. The overall material balance of tritium in the FFHR-2 system was discussed in terms of the tritium permeation through Flibe and the tritium recovery rate. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All fights reserved.

The model includes the detailed heterogeneous geometrical arrangement of the inboard (113) and outboard (013) blanket sectors. The total tritium breeding ratio (TBR) is similar to 1.07. The 1-D calculations tend to overestimate nuclear heating in the blanket by similar to 8% resulting in overestimating the plant thermal power. The approximate 1-D calculations overestimate damage and nuclear heating in the first wall (FW) and front zone of the blanket by factors of 1.3-1.7 but result in a steeper radial drop leading to significant underestimation (by up to a factor of 3) of nuclear parameters at the back. The 1-D calculations significantly underestimate radiation damage in the shield and vacuum vessel behind the blanket. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Addition of H-2 or H2O to inert sweep gas has been proposed for enhancing the release of bred tritium from breeder material in fusion reactors. However, its vaporization characteristic has not been well established. Application of an atmosphere-controlled high-temperature mass spectrometer has provided the vapor pressure data of Li-compounds evolved from Li2TiO3, under individual conditions of vacuum, D-2, D2O and O-2 atmospheres. The observed characteristics of vapor species evolved from Li2TiO3 under these conditions are presented here. The sum of the partial pressures of Li-containing species was figured out. The highest pressure was obtained in D2 followed by D2O and then, in vacuum, with the lowest being in O-2. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of Li vapor pressure indicated that Li-containing species appeared above 1273 K in vacuum and O-2 atmosphere, and above 973 K in D-2 or D2O atmospheres. After the vapor pressure measurement in D2 atmosphere, the color of the sample changed from white to dark blue. This change of color with the oxygen content decreased, suggested change from Ti4+ to Ti3+ in reduction atmosphere. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To recover tritium down to I wppm from Li, it is necessary to absorb tritium in Li into the Y hydride around at 523 K, if Y is in a hydride phase. However, it was found that limiting the use of the Y bed until its alpha phase relieves the temperature restriction. The hydrogen recovery rate was determined comparatively among the static Li-H-2, Y-H-2 and Li-Y-H-2 systems. Although the hydrogen absorbing rate of Li-Y-H-2 was comparable to that Of Y-H-2 at 673 K, it decreased at temperatures lower than 623 K due to reaction resistance at the Y surface. Relation between the surface effect and temperature was discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The mass transfer resistance representing tritium transfer from grain surface layer to surface water is newly introduced in this study. It is considered that the mass transfer resistance when tritium is transferred from gas phase to surface water is the same as that from surface water to gas phase. The estimated tritium release curves using the new model presented in this study give good agreement with the observed tritium release curves from Li4SiO4, Li2TiO3, Li2ZrO3 or LiAlO2. Comparison of the estimated release curve with the experimental release curve is discussed in this study for the case when a purge gas with water vapor is applied to extract bred tritium from various solid breeder materials.

In the present study, correlation between the tritium release and the annihilation of irradiation defects were investigated for neutron-irradiated Li2ZrO3. The annihilation of irradiation defects consisted of two processes, the fast and the slow processes. The activation energies for these processes were determined to be 0.32 +/- 0.01 and 0.80 +/- 0.01 eV, respectively. The E'-center of irradiation defects was found to act as a tritium trapping site by comparison between the annihilation of irradiation defects and tritium release. From the present and the previous works, the annihilation process of oxygen vacancies such as E'-center and F+-center could play an important role in tritium behavior. The results of the present and previous studies suggest that there appears to be similar correlation between annihilation of irradiation defects and tritium release for several ceramic breeder materials.

The dynamic adsorption and desorption (DAD) model has been developed to calculate the tritium release behavior from Li2O surface. In the DAD model, the tritium release behavior is considered to be controlled by the surface coverage of adsorbed species, such as OH-, O2-, H-, determined by the H-2 and H2O concentrations in the gas phase and the temperature. In a previous paper, the tritium residence time on the Li2O surface was calculated from the model, and the calculation results were compared with the experimental results. It was shown that the calculation results agreed well with the experimental results. In the present paper, a model for the surface behavior of tritium release from Li2TiO2 was constructed, according to the concept of the model for Li2O. The calculation results are compared with the experimental results and the validity of the tritium release mechanism assumed in the model is discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Larger flow rates are desirable in order to keep the tritium permeation losses low. Because of electrically conducting structures, pressure drop becomes already large at small flow rates. Moreover, tritium permeation depends sensitively on velocity distributions in the ducts; MHD issues are, therefore, also relevant for the HCLL.

The low solubility of hydrogen isotopes in the alloy generates an high partial pressure and, as a consequence, an high tritium permeation rate from the breeder into the He coolant and a considerable tritium inventory in the structural materials. Several experiments, devoted to determine the hydrogen solubility in lead lithium, have been performed in the past, giving contradictory results. To find a reliable value to be used in the safety analysis and in the design of both the tritium extraction system and the coolant purification system, the solubility of hydrogen (SOLE) experiment was launched in ENEA Brasimone in 2002. The SOLE device is based on the use of the absorption technique. The experimental results are in good agreement with the ones obtained in the past with similar techniques, varying from 1 x 10(-2) mol m(-3) Pa-1/2 up to 7 x 10(-2) mol m(-3) pa(-1/2). The experimental device and the obtained results are presented and discussed in this paper. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Objectives of solid breeder blanket testing during the first phase of the ITER operation focus on exploration of fusion break-in phenomena and configuration scoping. Specific emphasis is placed on first wall structural response, evaluation of neutronic parameters, assessment of thermomechanical behavior and characterization of tritium release. The tests will be conducted with three unit cell arrays/sub-modules. The development approach includes: (1) design the unit celUsub-module for low temperature operations and (2) refer to a reactor blanket design and use engineering scaling to reproduce key parameters under ITER wall loading conditions, so that phenomena under investigation can be measured at a reactor-like level.

In the present study, a series of hydrogen and deuterium permeation experiments was performed for ferritic F82H steel with and without a ceramic coating of Cr2O3-SiO2 including CrPO4. First, experiments were made on the permeability of F82H steel without coating at 300-600 degrees C in an atmosphere of 100-1000 Pa hydrogen and deuterium. The measured values of diffusion coefficient, permeability and solubility were in good agreement with those published previously. Next, experiments were performed on the permeability of F82H steel with the coating at 400-600 degrees C in an atmosphere of 1000-1500 Pa deuterium, and the permeation reduction factor (PRF) of the coating was determined. The obtained PRF at 600 degrees C was about 400, which is of the same order of magnitude as the PRF value of about 1000 previously evaluated for the same coating on an SS316 substrate. A significant decrease in the PRF (down to about 4%) was observed, when the sample temperature was lowered from 600 to 400 degrees C. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ab initio molecular dynamics calculations yielded ionic distances of the molten salt in good agreement with values from the literature. A tritium ion arbitrarily introduced into the molten salt sample stayed bonded to a fluorine ion for the entire simulation run and BeF42- molecules were observed as a result of the calculation. The extracted diffusion coefficients from mean square displacements of Li, F, and T were lower than experimental values found in the literature. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Test blanket module (TBM) testing in ITER is the most important milestone for the development of the blanket of the DEMO plant. Therefore, the major development effort has been focused on the development of the TBMs in Japan. This paper presents a structural concept of solid breeder TBMs cooled by pressurized water and helium gas. In the sub-module concept which was developed, a slitted box structure was adopted for both TBMs to simulate the DEMO blanket structure and to endure the over-pressurization in case of the coolant ingress to box structure. The breeder and neutron multiplier formed by small pebbles are packed separately in a layered structure. Detailed internal structure was developed with consideration of fabrication procedure, coolant flow route and purge gas flow route. Coolant flow route was considered from the view points of thermal-hydraulic and heat transfer performances. As for He purge gas flow passages, separated passages for tritium breeder layers and neutron multiplier layers were adapted to avoid tritium migration to the neutron multiplier layers.

To achieve the self-sufficient tritium breeding ratio (TBR), natural lead is introduced as an alternative neutron multiplier and a graphite neutron reflector is employed to minimize the neutron leakage. For the Be-free blanket concept, various neutronic analyses have been done with a Monte Carlo code to characterize its neutronic performance. It is found that a self-sufficient TBR can be achieved in a He-cooled solid breeder (Li4SiO4) blanket with a relatively thin lead neutron multiplier. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A parametric optimization study is performed to assess the impact of thickness and position of neutron reflectors. As the neutron reflector, Be, (B4C)-B-11, graphite, and TiC are considered. In spite of some unfavorable material properties, Be appears to be far superior to others from the TBR point of view. It is shown that a graphite-reflected HCML blanket can provide a sufficient TBR without a neutron multiplier if the reflector is utilized in an optimal way. For a graphite-reflected HCML blanket, the impact of the Li-6 composition on TBR is also investigated. In addition, the blanket neutron energy multiplication factor (NEM) and the distribution of nuclear heating are evaluated. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Cryo-pumping systems for torus exhaust and neutral beam injectors have been tested to confirm fast regeneration scenarios and to reduce the accumulation of semi-permanent inventories of tritiated impurities. A 1: 1 prototype of the torus exhaust cryo-pump is going to be manufactured and extensively tested. Tritium compatible mechanical pumps are being developed, in which leak rates to the exterior and contact between tritiated gases and lubricating oil have been minimized. Comprehensive integrated tests with the three-step process for torus exhaust processing were carried out. An ITER scale prototype fast delivery, self-assay storage bed has been developed; this component is designed to maximize the ratio of delivery rate to stored inventory and is undergoing testing. An integrated concept for the isotope separation (ISS) and water detritiation (WDS) systems has been developed and is being tested on relevant scale; this will provide an additional decontamination step for the potentially tritiated protium reject from the ISS. Extensive use of computer modeling to study the dynamic behavior of these and other fuel cycle systems is made. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Tritium accountancy is indispensable from the viewpoints of safety and plant operation because of the large amount of tritium used as fuel. DEMO is the quasi-steady continuous operation machine to demonstrate the feasibility of a fusion reactor as a commercial power production machine and it has functions of power production and tritium breeding. In addition to the basic accounting techniques for large amount of tritium in the tritium plant of the fusion system, which will be established in the ITER project, it is necessary to establish accounting techniques for tritium consumption and production. Dynamic accounting techniques have to be much improved or developed for optimum and safe control of the continuously operating fuel system of DEMO. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Impacting component performances are evaluated such as tritium permeation towards the He coolant in the blanket modules, lithium-lead circulation rate, tritium extraction unit efficiency, tritium permeation in steam generator, helium coolant leak rate, helium purification unit maximum flow rate and efficiency. Safety considerations are also taken into account. A finite element model (FEM) for tritium permeation was developed considering various phenomena such as tritium transport by convection and diffusion in lithium-lead, MHD effects on liquid metal flows, tritium permeation in structures with temperature gradients. Other sub-system performances, like He leak rate and efficiency of tritium extraction systems, are discussed via an engineering approach. The results show that a reasonable compromise among the various requirements can be found, leading to technologically achievable requirements for tritium permeation barriers, tritium extraction systems both from Pb-17Li and He, and leak rates from the He cooling system.

The isotope separation system (ISS) is the system used to separate hydrogen isotopes at the quality required to be stored in SDS, and is one of the systems with highest tritium inventory within the fuel cycle. Therefore, during tritium inventory procedure, ISS has to be 'milked down' of tritium, mainly as DT molecular species. Based on the dynamic modelling code TRIMO of the tritium content in the main sub-systems of ITER Fuel Cycle, the procedure for tritium extraction from ISS is presented and numerical examples given to assess the necessary time of transferring the tritium from ISS to SDS, and the residual amount of tritium in ISS after different milking scenarios. Consequently a fuel handling strategy during tritium inventory assessment in the ISS and SDS is described, with the constraint of mobilizable tritium inventory minimisation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, it is of prime importance to allocate the inventory as accurately as possible. Two essential control issues have to be met. The basic safety approach is to limit the amount of hydrogen such that the resulting pressure in case of an explosion accident is compatible to the design criteria of the vacuum vessel. This requirement drives the operational philosophy and the design of the cryogenic pumps which are connected to the vessel. The administrative limitation of the tritium inventory is another essential requirement on reactor operation. This paper illustrates how hydrogen inventory control issues are reflected by the operational schemes of the vacuum pumping systems. Latest results include the release characteristics of hydrogens and tritium during normal regeneration of the cryopumps and under off-normal events. The different semi-permanent contributions to the overall tritium inventory are discussed. The forepumping systems reduce the in-vessel inventory and act as interface to the tritium plant. A typical example of an integral pump-out curve is discussed. It is shown that sufficient safety margin is included in the ITER vacuum pumping design. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

During the irradiation and the NRA, the sample was continuously charged with deuterium by exposure to deuterium plasma and the permeation flux was monitored. Before the irradiation, the deuterium concentration near the plasma-exposure surface was 2.2 x 10(22) m(-3) at 398 K while it increased by 10,000 times after the irradiation with a dose of 1.5 x 10(21) m(-2). From the shape of the depth profile of trapped deuterium and its temperature dependence, it was found that two types of the traps were produced. One was considered to be vacancies and the other probably interstitial loops. These traps were not annihilated even at 575 K. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Inspection of alloy samples using X-ray diffraction spectra taken before use, midway through decomposition, and after use revealed that the ZrNi was gradually consumed and that ZrO2 and pure Ni were generated as decomposition progressed. From these results, a chemical equation for the water vapor decomposition reaction on ZrNi alloy was identified. The equation was validated by examining the relationships among the change in sample weight, the volume of water vapor decomposed, and the volume of hydrogen generated for samples removed midway through decomposition. The proposed equation explained all the experimental results quite well, and ZrNi was found to be well suited for the proposed method. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The tritium concentration in the cooling water and the tritium permeation rate to the coolant is assumed to be 370 GBq(10 Ci)/kg, 13 and 130 g/day, respectively. For the case of 13 g/day, the system can be composed of a water distillation (WD: 2.6 m inner diameter and similar to 50 m height) and a catalytic exchange column with an electrolysis cell (0.7 m inner diameter and 22 m in height). The WD column can be replaced by a system of catalytic exchange columns in vapor and liquid phases. For the case of 130 g/day, no solution can be found as long as quite a large flow rate to a main fuel cycle for its final treatment is permitted. Otherwise, an electrolysis cell that can be used under a high concentration of tritium water will need to be developed. The tritium inventory of the WD column is appreciably large, so that it is desirable to develop a system having a high separation factor and with no liquid phase. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

At a constant tritium partial-pressure ratio of 0.010, the relationship between the counting rate of bremsstrahlung X-rays, X (cpm) and the total pressure, P (Pa) can be expressed as X=4.1 x 10(5) (1 -e(-4.0P/100,000)). The counting rate depends only on tritium partial-pressure and the total pressure if the mixed gases contain no other species but hydrogen isotopes and helium isotopes. In addition, the relation between X and P can be simplified to a linear function in the low-pressure region of P << 2.5 x 10(4) Pa. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the blanket tritium recovery system (BTR), tritium is separated from sweep gas. Palladium (Pd) membrane diffuser is one of the applicable processes for BTR. Recently, the conceptual design study on the demonstration reactor with supercritical water cooling blanket, that is named 'DEMO2001', has been carried out in JAERI In this report, the application of the Pd diffuser to the blanket sweep gas condition is discussed based on DEMO2001 conditions. The counter flow may be the most opportune flow type for the Pd diffuser. However, Pd diffuser is suitable for the secondary process, like the purification process, after the tritium in the sweep gas has been concentrated by another method. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The exhaust gas from JT-60U during the experimental campaign has been investigated with micro gas chromatography (MGC). Gas species, such as hydrogen isotopes, CH4, C2H2 + C2H4, C2H6 and CO2, in the exhaust gas from a plasma discharge could be identified successfully. In this campaign, the total ratio of hydrogen isotopes and impurity species in exhaust gas was estimated to be 39 to 1. From the comparison between both amount of gas species and some plasma parameters, there was a tendency observed indicating that the amount of hydrogen isotopes and carbon compounds increased with maximum electron density. This relation suggests that the amount of hydrogen isotopes and carbon compounds in the exhaust gas is increases with the extension of plasma performance. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Isotope separation experiments of hydrogen and deuterium are performed with two types of packed beds filled with Kogel catalysts (4.0-6.7 mm spherical, 0.8 wt% Pt deposited) and Dixon gauze rings (6 mm, outer diameter, 6 mm height). One is the layered bed where layers of Kogel catalysts and that of Dixon gauze rings are filled in the column alternately. The other is the homogeneous bed where Kogel catalysts and Dixon gauze rings are mixed and filled in the column homogeneously. The separative performance of the homogeneous bed is appreciably greater than that of the layered bed, where the quantities of the catalysts are equal for both beds. The homogeneous packed bed exhibits fine performances; pressure drop is small in the range of 40-300 Pa/m and the coefficient of vapor-liquid mass transfer becomes more than 900 kmol/m(3)/h, while the superficial velocity is in the range 0.2-0.7 m/s.

WDS is one of the key systems to control the tritium content in the effluent streams, to recover as much tritium as possible and consequently to minimize the impact to the environment. The ITER WDS is based on combined electrolysis catalytic exchange (CECE) process employing a liquid phase catalytic exchange (LPCE) column. The separation performances after 6 months exposure to tritiated water of the catalyst-packing mixture to fill the LPCE column developed at Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK) are presented. A small stand-alone electrolysis cell has been in operation with tritiated water for 6 months. After 6 months continuously operation, the mechanical properties such as tensile strength and elongation of a solid polymer membrane (SPM) in service with tritiated water have been compared with those of a reference SPM in service with demineralized water.

In this contribution, fuel configuration and chemical form to be adopted in the FDS-I and possible fuel cycle schemes are clarified and analyzed based on the general survey. The influences of initial fuel loadings on the fuel cycle parameters are presented. Optimal analysis on the in-pile operation length is discussed and some recommendations are given to guide the design of optimized fuel cycle scheme on the basis of comprehensively considering the balance of the spent fuel loadings and the transmutation capacity.

It is suggested that part of He-3 from decay should be retained in the aged uranium tritide. The plateau of P-C-T curve is still wide and flat, and the change of the equilibrium plateau pressure is inconspicuous. Significant tritium heel is not observed in present works, so it can be neglected. The reduction of the reversible storage capacity is very little. In conclusion, the tritium aging effects in uranium tritide are slight, and uranium can be used as an effective material for long-term storage of tritium. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As the construction of a fusion demonstration reactor, DEMO, for demonstrating competitive electrical power generation will be the next important program milestone after ITER, the timely availability of a sound materials database has become an indispensable element in international fusion road maps. The primary mission of IFMIF is to generate a materials irradiation database for the design, construction, licensing and safe operation of DEMO. Based on a recently completed comprehensive design report, IFMIF is ready to enter an Engineering Validation and Engineering Design Activity (EVEDA) phase with a subsequent start of construction around 2011. All mayor subsystems of the IFMIF test facility architecture like the Target and Test Cell, the access and maintenance cells as well as the hot cells are fully remote controlled and allow division into radiation zones. Sophisticated remote handling technologies originally developed for fission reactors are inevitably required, especially for assembly and maintenance of the Li-target and test assemblies. The present status of the test facilities is reviewed and major advances during the past few years in the irradiation performance as well as in the nuclear Target and Test Cell design are highlighted.

A solution to the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) problem for the V-Li concept may be attainable using multilayer coatings or a flow channel insert with vanadium in contact with the flowing Li instead of a ceramic insulating layer. These strategies rely on the expected excellent compatibility of vanadium alloys which is being further investigated. For systems using Pb-17Li, capsule testing of SiC and various alloys is being conducted. Monolithic SiC specimens exposed for 1000h in Pb-Li at 800 and 1100 degrees C showed no mass change after cleaning and no detectable increase in the Si content of the Pb-Li after the test. In order to investigate the behavior of corrosion resistant aluminide coatings, initial capsule testing at 700 degrees C has been used to establish baseline dissolution rates for 316 stainless steel, FeCrAl, Fe3Al and NiAl. The samples containing Al showed significantly less mass loss than 316 stainless steel, suggesting that aluminide coatings will be beneficial in this temperature range. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The surface morphology was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the deuterium retention in the irradiated samples measured using thermal desorption spectrometry (TDS). The results indicate that at substrate temperature around 400-500 K dense and high dome-shaped blisters appeared at the surface and the deuterium retention also reached its maxima. The blisters then became lower and sparse and finally disappeared at 900 K. Additionally, the D retention decreased to a quite low level above 700 K. Thermal desorption spectra of the deuterium in the irradiated samples showed four peak temperatures as a function of the substrate temperature during irradiation, indicating different types of trapping sites.

In situ observation shows the voids formed by electron-beam irradiation coalescence which grew to larger sizes with irradiation dose. Values of void size, void number density and void swelling in HAZ were larger than those of the matrix, and these increased and saturated gradually with irradiation dose. Non-equilibrium segregation phenomenon involving Cr depletion and Ni enrichment at grain boundaries were also observed in both the HAZ and matrix of welded SUS304 steel. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The chemical behavior of Si and C, and deuterium retention were evaluated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS). It was found that the decreasing rate of retention of D bound to Si was higher than that bound to C by He+ pre-implantation, indicating that He mainly interacts with the D trapping site with Si, namely carbon vacancies, and the displacement of C atoms would occur. Some He remained in the carbon vacancies and desorbed by heating. Some displaced C would migrate to the surface and aggregate on the surface by heating above 1300 K, although most of Si-C bond was recovered. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, there are some problems related to the application of beryllium as a neutron multiplier, which include compatibility with structural materials, tritium inventory and reaction of beryllium with water vapor and oxygen in a LOCA accident. Titanium beryllides such as Be12Ti are known to have advantages over beryllium from the perspectives of higher melting point, lower chemical reactivity and lower swelling. Thus, these materials are promising alternatives of beryllium. The authors investigate here the reaction of titanium beryllides with water vapor at high temperatures, and it is found that Be12Ti is by far more tolerant to water vapor than beryllium. To clarify the high tolerance of Be12Ti to water vapor, the surface of Be12Ti used in the experiment was investigated by means of digital microscope, SEM, XRD and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). These analyses suggest that some oxidized state of beryllium was formed on the surface of Be12Ti exposed to water vapor. In particular. the results of the ESCA analysis gave some clues to understanding the higher tolerance of Be12Ti to water vapor at high temperatures. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The damage rates reactor have been evaluated under the first wall neutron loading of 1 MW/m(2) of both Nb- and V-based alloys calculated are about (1-3) x 10(-4) dpa/y at the TF coils adjacent to the vacuum vessel and (2-6) x 10(-7) dpa/y at the surface of CS coil. The damage rate of MgB2 is about 1 order magnitude higher than those of Nb- and V-based superconducting materials. Most of the induced activity of V-based alloys and MgB2 after shutdown of the reactor is controlled by Co-60 formed from Cu. Nb-based alloys are predicted to emit gamma rays for tens of thousands years due to Nb-94 from Nb. In the case of the CS coils, the formation of Nb-94 is minimal, and the gamma ray decay of Nb-based alloys is expected to be faster than that of V-based alloys. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The pebbles of 0.3-2 mm in diameter have been fabricated by a wet process and its characterization have been performed. Mechanical proper-ties such as compressive strength are necessary for the design of fusion blanket packing the small pebbles. In this study, collapse loads of Li2TiO3 pebbles with different diameters were measured by an unconfined compression tester, and contact strength of these pebbles was evaluated by Hertzian contact theory. In the results, the contact strength of L2TiO3 pebbles decreased with increasing the radius. The radial strength of Li2TiO3 pebbles was about 1.7 times large as the evaluated compression strength. On the other hand, the contact strength of Li2TiO3 pebbles was also independent of Li-6 enrichment. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An imaging plate (IP), which is a radiation image detector successfully applied for the tritium analysis of plasma-facing walls, easily detects beta-electrons from C-14 and would give a detailed C-14 deposition profiles, hence the IP method can be one of the postmortem measurements of the C-14 deposition. However, since beta-electrons from tritium would superpose those from C-14, it is essential to differentiate beta-electrons of C-14 from those of tritium. To do this, we have developed a film insertion technique in which a thin film is inserted between a specimen and IP to prohibit lower energy electrons passing through the film. It is found that C-14 concentrations as small as 10 Bq/cm(2) (similar to 2.6 x 10(12 14)C/cm(2)) can be detected, indicating that this technique keeps the advantage of C-14 as a high sensitivity tracer, and making two-dimensional C-14 profiling possible without any disturbance of co-existing tritium.

To ensure tritium self-sufficiency, the calculated achievable tritium breeding ratio (TBR) should be equal to or greater than the required TBR. The potential of achieving tritium self-sufficiency depends on many system physics and technology parameters. Interactive physics and technology R&D programs should be implemented to determine the potential of realizing those physics and technology options and parameters that have large effects on attaining a realistic "window" for tritium self-sufficiency. The ranges of plasma and technology conditions that need to be met, in order to ensure tritium self-sufficiency, are identified. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
