Variations in radiation exposures of adults and children in the UK	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article							UNITED-KINGDOM; RADON; POPULATION; RAYS	Members of the UK population receive radiation doses from a number of sources including cosmic radiation, from uranium, thorium and their decay products, particularly radon, and from medical sources. On average, members of the UK population receive an effective dose of about 200 mSv over their lifetime. This results in a risk of fatal cancer of about 1%. However, the radiation dose is not the same to all individuals. Some components give doses that vary systematically from one region to another. Doses may also vary greatly from one individual to another. The rate at which the dose is accumulated may vary as the individual ages. Different organs and tissues do not necessarily receive the same dose. This paper discusses these factors and attempts to quantify them. Cosmic rays deliver doses which vary little across the body or between individuals. Terrestrial gamma rays also deliver more or less uniform whole-body doses, but the difference between individuals can be greater. Radionuclides in food deliver doses which vary both across the body and between individuals. These variations are even more marked in the case of doses from radon and from medical exposures.

Estimation of the radiological risk related to the presence of radon 222 in a hydrotherapy centre in Tunisia	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article							SPANISH SPAS; RADIOACTIVITY	The Rn-222 concentration in air was measured in a thermal water spa used as a hydrotherapy centre in Tunisia. The associated health risk for employees and patients due to the inhalation of Rn-222 and its progeny was estimated. A protection scheme for the employees of the spas has been designed. Results show that the Rn-222 concentration varies in the range 33-589 Bq m(-3). The Rn-222 concentrations measured in the present study show lower values in comparison to those reported for thermal spas in other countries. The Rn-222 concentration in different rooms of the spa depends mainly on the ventilation rate. A model based on a dosimetric approach was adopted to estimate the radon risk considering the Rn-222 concentration, the time spent in the spa, and the radioactive equilibrium factor F. The annual effective dose was found to vary between 0.2 and 1.7 mSv for workers while the range for patients was from 2.8 x 10(-4) to 1.1 x 10(-4) mSv. These values are within the ICRP recommended values.

J	King, JC; El-Genk, MS				King, Jeffrey C.; El-Genk, Mohamed S.			Submersion-Subcritical Safe Space (S-4)reactor	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							POWER-SYSTEM; REACTOR; DESIGN; AMTEC	The Submersion-Subcritical Safe Space (S-4) reactor, developed for future space power applications and avoidance of single point failures, is presented. The S' reactor has a Mo-14% Re solid core, loaded with uranium nitride fuel, cooled by He-30% Xe and sized to provide 550 kWth for 7 years of equivalent full power operation. The beryllium oxide reflector of the S-4 reactor is designed to completely disassemble upon impact on water or soil. The potential of using Spectral Shift Absorber (SSA) materials in different forms to ensure that the reactor remains subcritical in the worst-case submersion accident is investigated. Nine potential SSAs are considered in terms of their effect on the thickness of the radial reflector and on the combined mass of the reactor and the radiation shadow shield. The SSA materials are incorporated as a thin (0.1 mm) coating on the outside surface of the reactor core and as core additions in three possible forms: 2.0 mm diameter pins in the interstices of the core block, 0.25 mm thick sleeves around the fuel stacks and/or additions to the uranium nitride fuel. Results show that with a boron carbide coating and 0.25 mm iridium sleeves around the fuel stacks the S' reactor has a reflector outer diameter of 43.5 cm, with a combined reactor and shadow shield mass of 935.1 kg. The S-4 reactor with 12.5 at.% gadolinium-155 added to the fuel, 2.0 mm. diameter gadolinium-155 sesquioxide interstitial pins, and a 0.1 mm thick gadolinium- 155 sesquioxide coating has a slightly smaller reflector outer diameter of 43.0 cm, resulting in a smaller total reactor and shield mass of 901.7 kg. With 8.0 at.% europium-151 added to the fuel, along with europium-151 sesquioxide for the pins and coating, the reflector's outer diameter and the total reactor and shield mass are further reduced to 41.5 cm and 869.2 kg, respectively.

Two different fuel compositions have been used: (1) 97% thoria (ThO(2)) + 3PuO(2) and (2) 92% ThO(2) + 5% UO(2) + 3% PuO(2). The latter is used to denaturize the new (233)U fuel with (238)U. The temporal variation of the criticality k(infinity) and the burn-up values of the reactor have been calculated by full power operation for a period of 20 years. The criticality starts by k infinity = similar to 1.48 for both fuel compositions. A sharp decrease of the criticality has been observed in the first year as a consequence of rapid plutonium burnout. The criticality becomes quasi constant after the second year and remains above k infinity > 1.06 for similar to 20 years. After the second year, the CANDU reactor begins to operate practically as a thorium burner. Very high burn up could be achieved with the same fuel material (up to 500,000 MW(.)D/T), provided that the fuel rod claddings would be replaced periodically (after every 50,000 or 100,000 MW.D/T). The reactor criticality will be sufficient until a great fraction of the thorium fuel is burnt up. This would reduce fuel fabrication costs and nuclear waste mass for final disposal per unit energy drastically. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Non-linear damage accumulation in Au-irradiated SrTiO3	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						strontium titanate; irradiation effects; defects; damage accumulation; amorphization; Rutherford backscattering spectrometry; ion channel	DISPLACEMENT ENERGIES; SUBLATTICES; TITANATES; EVOLUTION; CERAMICS; UO2	Ion-induced damage in strontium titanate (SrTiO3) has been investigated using 1.0 MeV Au ions at 150 K and room temperature. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry using 2.0 MeV He+ beam was carried out along the < 100 > direction to study crystalline damage and the accumulation behavior. Damage accumulation has been determined as the relative disorder on the Sr and Ti sublattices at the damage peak as a function of local dose. A disorder accumulation model has been fit to both the Sr and Ti damage accumulation data and contributions from the amorphous fraction and the crystalline disorder are discussed. The results indicate that defect-stimulated amorphization is the primary amorphization mechanism in SrTiO3. The sigmoidal behavior in damage accumulation leads to non-linear increase of the width of the damage profile. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Precise gamma ray measurement of the radial distribution of a cracking catalyst at diluted concentrations in a glass riser	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						concentration distribution; gamma ray transmission; riser profile; cold model; FCC catalyst	SYSTEMS	The radial concentration distribution of a cracking catalyst circulating in a glass riser of a cold model was precisely measured in diluted flow regime. Catalyst and compressed air were the components of the fluidized bed system. The gamma transmission measurements were carried out with a Am-241 radioactive source and a scintillation NaI(TI) detector. The gamma ray transmission profile of riser was evaluated and the main effects were identified. The standard uncertainty in the concentration values was evaluated as a function of the photopeak counts. A model was proposed to describe the profile curve of the empty riser as a function of the chordal length that fits experimental data adequately. A calibration of catalyst density carried out in static experiments and an integral evaluation of the radial scan were compared with punctual density. Under flow conditions the radial concentration distribution was measured at (2-16) kg/m(3) and at (10-60) kg/m(3) intervals. At two different airflow rates, concentration distribution tendency to move from the annular to the core region in the higher airflow, was observed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Gamma-spectra were taken in the far-field of the sample, which was assumed to be cylindrical. The Pu content of the sources was evaluated from the count rates of the gamma-peaks of Pu-239, relying on the assumption that the gamma-rays are coming to the detector parallel to each other. The uncertainty components are studied in detail. It is also shown that the isotopic composition and the age of plutonium (Pu) can be determined in the intensive neutron field of these sources by the "multi-group analysis" method. The determination of the specific neutron yields is also discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Indeed, these devices require encapsulation with a barrier material which exhibits extremely low permeation rates for water vapour and oxygen. In order to determine these low permeation rates, the degradation of a metallic calcium layer encapsulated with the barrier material is usually monitored. However, the individual contributions of oxygen and water vapour to this degradation cannot be clearly distinguished. In this study, the corrosion of metallic calcium was investigated using isotopic markers in connection with ion beam analysis. We have shown that calcium reacts only with water at room temperature.

For example, they may be used as ionic conductors in solid oxide fuel cells or nuclear waste forms for the storage of actinides, particularly Pu. Here, the recent progress in understanding ion beam irradiation-induced phenomena in pyrochlore compounds is briefly reviewed with a focus on the ion beam-induced crystalline-to-amorphous and pyrochlore-to-fluorite structural transitions. Systematic ion irradiation studies of lanthanide pyrochlores with B = Ti, Zr and Sn have indicated that the radiation response of the pyrochlore compounds is highly dependent on compositional changes. Both the ionic size and cation electronic configurations (e.g. bond-types) affect the structural distortion from the ideal fluorite structure and thus the response of pyrochlore-structure types to ion beam irradiation. An ion beam-induced pyrochlore-to-fluorite structural transition occurs in all irradiated pyrochlore compositions, and the independent kinetics of the cation and anion disordering processes has been discussed. Numerous novel nanostructures have been created by utilizing the ion beam-induced amorphization, order-disorder transition and phase decomposition, such as amorphous and disordered nanodomains, perfectly lattice matched two-dimensional nanolayers, self-organized ripple structures, metallic nanoparticles and nanowires.

Radiation damage in actinide oxides UO2, (U0.92Ce0.08)O-2, and actinide nitride UN has been characterized after irradiation with swift heavy ions. Fluences up to 3 x 10(13) ions/cm(2) of heavy ions (Kr 740 Mev, Cd 1 GeV) available at the CIRIL/GANIL facility were used to simulate irradiation in reactors by fission products and by neutrons. The macroscopic effects of irradiation remains very weak compared with those seen in other ceramic oxides irradiated in the same conditions: practically no swelling can be measured and no change in colour can be observed on the irradiated part of a polished face of sintered disks. The point defects in irradiated actinide compounds have been characterized by optical absorption spectroscopy in the LTV-Vis-NIR wavelength range. The absorption spectra before and after irradiation are compared, and unexpected stability of optical properties during irradiation is shown. This result confirms the low rate of formation of point defects in actinide oxides and actinide nitrides under irradiation. Actinide oxides and nitrides studied are > 40% ionic, and oxidation state of the actinides seems to be stable during irradiation. The small amount of point defects produced by radiation (< 10(16) cm) has been identified from differences between the absorption spectrum before irradiation and the one after irradiation: point defects in oxygen or nitrogen lattices can be observed respectively in oxides and nitrides (F centres), and small amounts of U5+ would be present in all compounds.

The tunnel recombination phosphorescence, as well as luminescence, stimulated by 1.5-2.5 eV photons has been detected in the sample preliminarily irradiated at 6 or 80 K. The main peaks of thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) in the irradiated ceramics have been observed at 72, 118 and 265 K. The creation spectra of the 118 K TSL peak, as well as the excitation spectrum of photostimulated luminescence (PSL) span the region of the intrinsic absorption of a lithium orthosilicate (9-30 eV). The intensity of PSL and the TSL peaks in Li4SiO4 ceramics prepared in hydrogen/argon atmosphere is several times lower than that in the mainly investigated Li4SiO4 ceramics prepared in the atmosphere of dry argon. The optical characteristics of Li4SiO4 are compared with the ones known for Li2O and SiO2. Low-temperature luminescent methods are promising for the investigation of electron-hole processes and radiation defects serving as the traps for tritium released in D-T fusion reactor blanket systems.

In order to separate each of these processes and understand the high-density electronic excitation effects, 70-210 MeV FP ion (Xe10-14+, I7+ and Zr9+) irradiation studies on CeO2, as a simulation of fluorite ceramics of UO2, have been done at a tandem accelerator of JAEA-Tokai and the microstructure changes were determined by transmission electron microscope (TEM). Measurements of the diameter of ion tracks, which are caused by high-density electronic excitation, have clarified that the effective area of electronic excitation by high-energy fission products is around 5-7 nm phi and the square of the track diameter tends to follow linear function of the electronic stopping power (S-e). Prominent changes are hardly observed in the microstructure up to 400 degrees C. After overlapping of ion tracks, the elliptical deformation of diffraction spots is observed, but the diffraction spots are maintained at higher fluence. These results indicate that the structure of CeO2 is still crystalline and not amorphous. Under ion tracks overlapping heavily (> 1 x 10(15) ions/cm(2)), surface roughness, with characteristic size of the roughness around 1 mu m, is observed and similar surface roughness has also been observed in light-water reactor (LWR) fuels.

Implications of alternative strategies for transition to sustainable fuel cycles	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							NUCLEAR-POWER; TRANSMUTATION; MANAGEMENT; INVENTORY; DESIGN; IMPACT	Fuel cycles employing recycling of actinides in the thermal COmbined NonFertile and UO2 (CONFU)fuel light water reactor (LWR) or fast Actinide Burner Reactor (ABR) plus standard LWRs are compared to the once-through LWR fuel cycle under the assumption of moderately growing worldwide demand for nuclear energy until 2050. The transuranic elements (TRUs) in temporary storage, the TRUs sent to permanent repositories, and the system cost are taken as key figures of merit. The CONFU strategy (standard LWRs plus CONFU LWRs) is shown to reduce the TRU accumulation by similar to 34%, relative to the reference once-through fuel cycle strategy, while the ABR strategy (standard LWRs plus ABRs) exhibits a smaller reduction (by 9%). The CONFU fuel assembly was designed to stabilize the TRU inventory in LWRs with zero TRU incineration rate. Nevertheless, deployment of this concept limits the ex-core TRU inventory. The actinide production in the CONFUs is also reduced by virtue of the loading of 20% of the core with nonfertile actinide fuel pins. On the other hand, the ABR burner, designed to consume the actinides in fertile-free fuel (FFF), has a large net TRU incineration rate and therefore a potential for faster TRU depletion from storage facilities. However, it suffers from a likely delay of deployment, compared to the CONFU, due to the need for more extensive research and development effort. Even when extending the time frame to 100 yr, the fast ABR cannot overcome the disadvantage of its late deployment compared to the thermal CONFU. In part, this is due to the fact that the ABR has a lower TRU destruction rate per gigawatt(electric) than the CONFU because of its higher thermal efficiency. Both strategies greatly reduce the total TRU mass destined to the permanent repositories, thus alleviating the burden of licensing a large number of such repositories, and the risk from deliberate or accidental excavation of TRUs from the repositories. The implementation of these strategies requires development of FFF pins for both CONFU cores and fast reactors. Economic analyses show that both closed fuel cycles are more expensive than the reference once-through scheme. The total busbar cost of electricity production is expected to be 4 to 5 mills/kW center dot h(electric) (similar to 10 to 12%) larger than the. once-through cycle case if the spent-fuel separation is paid for by electricity sales from the separated fuel. The cost impact will be much less if the necessary funds are collected while the original fuel is irradiated.

J	Ding, SY; Xu, K; Huang, XJ; Wang, Z				Ding, Shengyao; Xu, Kun; Huang, Xiaojian; Wang, Zheng			A N-16/O-19 monitor for leak detection in a steam generator	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						steam generator; leak detection; ratio of N-16 to O-19 activities		This paper describes a new system for monitoring leaks in a steam generator. The new system extends the traditional N-16 monitor to detect both the rate and the location of a leak. Because the transit time is different for radioactive N-16 and O-19 to travel from the reactor core via the hot bottom side, cold bottom side, or bend region of the U-tube in a steam generator to the gamma-ray detector, the new system uses the different transit times to identify the location of leaks. Specifically, the ratio So of N-16 to O-19 activities in the reactor core of a swimming pool reactor was calculated by combining the cross sections sigma(np)(E) and sigma(ny)(E) with the neutron spectra phi(n)(E). The ratio S-1 of N-16 to O-19 activities in the measurement room was also calculated and measured by the high-purity germanium and NaI(Tl) detectors. The result of the calculation agrees with the measurement within an acceptable range.

J	Christensen, H				Christensen, Hilbert			Calculation of corrosion rates of alpha-doped UO2	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						radiolytic oxidation; UO2; alpha radiation	PU-238-DOPED UO2; RADIOLYSIS; DISSOLUTION; WATER; FUEL	A previously developed radiolysis model has been used to simulate experiments from four laboratories. The source strengths in the experiments with UO2, doped with Pu-238, were 0.01, 0.1, and 1 Ci/g. The agreement was good with the experimental results of Stroes-Gascoyne et al. for their sample with 0.1 Ci/g. Their sample containing 0.01 Ci/g gave a factor-of-3-higher calculated corrosion rate compared with the experimental rate. In the experiments of Cobos et al. and of Kelm and Bohnert, using alpha-doped UO2, the calculated corrosion rates were somewhat lower than the experimental rates. However, recent experiments by Rondinella et al. using UO2 with 10% doped U-233 gave considerably lower corrosion rates in good agreement with the model. The calculated corrosion rates for the same source strength were about the same for the experiments by Stroes-Gascoyne et al., Kelm and Bohnert, and Cobos et al. However, the experimental rates varied considerably. The agreement was not good with experiments using Pu(VI) dissolved in solution, in which case the calculated corrosion rate was ten times or more than ten times lower than the experimental rate. The reason for this disagreement could be a chemical effect of Pu(VI) in the solution.

Behaviour of tritium released into the working rooms of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor	PLASMA DEVICES AND OPERATIONS			English	Article						International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor working rooms; reference accidents; tritium; air contamination; surface contamination; detritiation dynamics		The behaviour of tritium released into the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) working rooms in the form of HTO or T-2 as a result of some postulated reference accidents is analysed. The dynamics of air and of surface detritiation are studied for different rooms with specific wall coatings at a design ventilation throughput. Adsorption in the walls and on the surface of equipment is shown to be an important factor that may determine the level of air contamination and the time needed to detritiate the contaminated rooms. The role of different factors in the detritiation process is discussed. Measures are proposed that can be adopted at the design stage to mitigate the consequences of tritium release into the working rooms of the ITER and to reduce the time needed to decontaminate room air to a permissible level.

Biomonitoring of atmospheric trace element deposition around an industrial town in Ghana	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						biomonitoring; trace element deposition; factor analysis; lichen; Parmelia suleata; neutron activation analysis	TRANSPLANTED LICHEN; HEAVY-METALS; POLLUTANTS; PORTUGAL	Parmelia sulcata lichen species have been used to study the atmospheric deposition of heavy metals and other toxic elements around an industrial area in Ghana. Natural soil samples were collected at all the sampling points and analysed in order to investigate surface accumulation of the heavy metals. The sampling points used for the study were: Afienya, Doryemu Cemetery and Doryemu River. The surface accumulation of the heavy metals would be used to examine the correlation of the elements in the lichen and soil samples in order to separate contributions from atmospheric deposition and from that of soil minerals. Thermal neutron activation analysis techniques employing a 30 kW tank-in-pool research reactor operating at a thermal neutron flux of 5 x 10(11) s(-1) cm(-2) was used to determine Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ti, Th and V in both the lichen and soil samples. The level of contamination was quantified using the enrichment factor approach. This approach was adopted in order to ascertain whether these elements are enriched in the soil or in the atmosphere. The sampling points were enriched in the atmosphere with Cr, Mn, Fe, Ti, Th and V in the decreasing order of Afienya, Doryemu Cemetery and Doryemu River. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Effects of gamma radiations on glass network and structural units have been studied by irradiating glass samples with a Co-60 radioisotope to the overall dose of 2.5 kGy. It is shown that irradiation causes compaction of the borate network by breaking the bonds between trigonal elements, which leads to a decrease in the optical band gap energy. Changes in the atomic structure before and after the irradiation are observed and explained. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Radiation sensitivity of Salmonella isolates relative to resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol or gentamicin	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						antibiotic resistance; irradiation; nalidixic acid; Salmonella; D-10 value; selective marker	ESCHERICHIA-COLI O157-H7; FRESH PRODUCE; MICROORGANISMS; IRRADIATION; MECHANISM; LETTUCE; FOODS	Antibiotic resistance of inoculated bacteria is a commonly used selective marker. Bacteria resistant to the antibiotic nalidixic acid have been shown to have an increased sensitivity to irradiation. The purpose of this research was to screen a collection of Salmonella isolates for antibiotic resistance and determine the association, if any, of antibiotic resistance with radiation sensitivity. Twenty-four clinical isolates of Salmonella were screened for native resistance to multiple concentrations of ampicillin (Amp), chloramphenicol (Chl), or gentamicin (Gm). Test concentrations were chosen based on established clinical minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) levels, and isolates were classified as either sensitive or resistant based on their ability to grow at or above the MIC. Salmonella cultures were grown overnight at (37 degrees C) in antibiotic-amended tryptic soy broth (TSB). Native resistance to Gm was observed with each of the 24 isolates (100%). Eight isolates (33%) were shown to be resistant to Amp, while seven isolates (29%) were shown to be resistant to Chl. In separate experiments, Salmonella cultures were grown overnight (37 degrees C) in TSB, centrifuged, and the cell pellets were re-suspended in phosphate buffer. The samples were then gamma irradiated at doses up to 1.0 kGy. The D-10 values (the ionizing radiation dose required to reduce the viable number of microorganisms by 90%) were determined for the 24 isolates and they ranged from 0.181 to 0.359 kGy. No correlation was found between the D 10 value of the isolate and its sensitivity or resistance to each of the three antibiotics. Resistance to Amp or Chl is suggested as appropriate resistance marker for Salmonella test strains to be used in studies of irradiation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Experimental determination of the dose deposition profile of a Sr-90 beta source	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								Three different methods for characterising the dose deposition profile of a Sr-90/Y-90 radioactive source are described: GAFChromic film dosimetry, Thermoluminescence (TL) and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL). For the film measurements, GAFChromic film samples were stacked at different depths between polyethylene terephthalate (PET) foils. For TL, the thickness of a TLD-500 dosemeter was gradually reduced by polishing and the TL from chips of different thickness was used in conjunction with a mathematical model based on the exponential attenuation of dose inside the crystal to determine the decay constant for the dose-depth profile. Finally, an OSL reader with confocal stimulation / detection capabilities was used to map the two-dimensional dose distribution in TLD-500 dosemeters as a function of depth. The shapes of the dose deposition profiles obtained from all the investigated methods are in good agreement.

External dosimetry in the aftermath of a radiological terrorist event	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								This paper reviews external dosimetry in emergency preparedness planning for a potential terrorist release of radioactive material in a densely populated area. The radiation dose received by response workers and members of the public is needed to understand health risks. The existing framework for dosimetry of routinely occupationally exposed workers is not directly applicable to all emergency workers who would respond to a radiological terrorist event. Emergency preparedness plans incorporate various old and new dosimetry technologies, including quartz fibre electrets, electronic dosemeters, personnel badges and wallet cards. Environmental monitoring and dose calculations are the usual methods for determining public dose. However, during the late-phase response, after removable contamination has been eliminated, it may be easier and more straightforward to provide individual dosimetry for members of the public who may be moving through a city with varying contamination areas. Doing so could allow resumption of normal activities earlier and promote confidence in reusing the site.

Preliminary dosimetric characterisation of thermoluminescent materials for beta radiation monitoring at nuclear medicine services	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							TEFLON PELLETS	Beta emitters are widely used in nuclear medicine for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The critical groups exposed to a radioactive patient include the staff, other patients and members of the public accompanying the patient. The aim of this work is to characterise thermoluminescent (TL) materials for the staff monitoring of nuclear medicine services that manipulate beta radiation solutions of (153)Sm. This study was performed using CaSO(4):Dy + Teflon pellets, produced at IPEN, with different dimensions. For the dosimetric characterisation, these TL dosemeters were exposed to gamma source ((60)Co) and to beta sealed sources ((90)Sr + (90)Y, (204)Tl and (147)Pm) and to a non-sealed source ((153)Sm). Results were obtained related to reproducibility, lower detection limits, calibration curves, angle and energy dependence of response. All tested materials show usefulness for monitoring of workers exposed to beta radiation.

Performance of the electronic personal dosemeter for neutron 'Saphydose-N' at different workplaces of nuclear facilities	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							FIELD	This paper mainly aims at presenting the measurements and the results obtained with the electronic personal neutron dosemeter Saphydose-N at different facilities. Three campaigns were led in the frame of the European contract EVIDOS ('Evaluation of Individual Dosimetry in Mixed Neutron and Photon Radiation Fields'). The first one consisted in the measurements at the IRSN French research laboratory in reference neutron fields generated by a thermal facility (SIGMA), radionuclide ISO sources ((AmBe)-Am-241; Cf-252; Cf-252(D2O)\Cd) and a realistic spectrum (CANEL/T400). The second one was performed at the Krummel Nuclear Power Plant (Germany) close to the boiling water reactor and to a spent fuel transport cask. The third one was realised at Mol (Belgium), at the VENUS Research Reactor and at Belgonucleaire, a fuel processing factory.

Thermal stability of the thermoluminescence trap structure of bentonite	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th International Conference on Soild State Dosimetry	JUN 27-JUL 02, 2004	New Haven, CT	Yale Univ Sch Med, Int Org Solid State Dosimetry, Oxford Univ Press, Landauer Inc, Canberra Ind, Global Dosimetry Solut Inc			LUMINESCENCE SPECTRA	This work reports about the thermal stability of the blue thermoluminescence (TL) of a well-characterised natural bentonite from Almeria (Spain). The main interest of this clay, mainly composed of montmorillonite, is because of its application in the field of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) repository in deep-lying rocks. As observed in other aluminosilicates, bentonite exhibits a very complex structure of the emission spectra based on a wide broad maximum peaked at similar to 265 degrees C that can be associated to physico-chemical processes such as dehydroxylation processes, consecutive breaking linking of bonds, formation of hydrolysed ions and redox reactions. The thermal stability tests performed at different temperatures confirm a continuum in the distribution of traps. Hence, the glow curve analysis methods commonly used for synthetic materials based on single discrete traps cannot be applied for this material and the kinetic parameters were fitted assuming an exponential distribution of trapped electrons.

Confocal fluorescent imaging of tracks from heavy charged particles utilising new Al2O3 : C,Mg crystals	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th International Conference on Soild State Dosimetry	JUN 27-JUL 02, 2004	New Haven, CT	Yale Univ Sch Med, Int Org Solid State Dosimetry, Oxford Univ Press, Landauer Inc, Canberra Ind, Global Dosimetry Solut Inc			DOSIMETRY	A completely optical, non-destructive imaging of tracks in a fluorescent crystal provides a new way to detect and to assess doses from heavy charged particles and neutrons. The technique combines confocal fluorescent microscopy with a new radiation-sensitive, luminescent material based on aluminium oxide single crystals doped with carbon, magnesium and having aggregate oxygen vacancy defects (Al2O3:C,Mg). Radiation-induced colour centres in the new material have an absorption band at 620 nm and produce fluorescence at 750 nm with a high quantum yield and a short, 75 +/- 5 ns, fluorescence lifetime. Three-dimensional spatial distribution of fluorescent intensity allows one to obtain depth-dose distributions and to discriminate between high- and low-linear energy transfer radiations. Images of single tracks produced by different types of radiation have been obtained. Irradiations with a calibrated Am-241 alpha source showed high efficiency for track detection. Thermal neutrons were detected using a nuclear reaction with a (LiF)-Li-6 radiator and production of alpha particles and tritium ions. Fast neutrons were detected using recoil protons produced in a polyethylene radiator installed in front of the crystalline detector. Three-dimensional reconstruction of a recoil proton propagating through the crystal was demonstrated.

In situ long-term monitoring system for radioactive contaminants	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th International Conference on Soild State Dosimetry	JUN 27-JUL 02, 2004	New Haven, CT	Yale Univ Sch Med, Int Org Solid State Dosimetry, Oxford Univ Press, Landauer Inc, Canberra Ind, Global Dosimetry Solut Inc				A long-term in situ subsurface instrument for monitoring radioactive contaminant plumes, as an alternative to soil analysis, is described. A portable, laser-based reader optically stimulates luminescence from sensors, each containing an Al2O3:C dosemeter. The sensors, designed for placement at various subsurface locations around a waste site, are allowed to accumulate dose for a predetermined time that is based on the instrument's minimum detectable dose (MDD). The reader is then attached to the sensor by fibre optic cable to read the accumulated dose; an increase above natural background levels indicating the presence of leaked radioactivity. Based on an MDD of 5 mu Gy, it is shown that the sensor can measure soil concentrations of 1.85 Bq cm(-3) after an exposure time of 50 h for Cs-137 and 67 h for Sr-90/Y-90. Discrimination between beta and gamma radiation is possible using an end cap placed over one of the two paired sensors, allowing simultaneous measurement of Cs-137 and Sr-90/Y-90 in a mixed field. The monitor system represents a substantial improvement over quarterly soil sampling because of a greatly increased measurement frequency and the ability to perform measurements reproducibly.

Study of gel materials as radioactive Rn-222 gas detectors	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th International Conference on Soild State Dosimetry	JUN 27-JUL 02, 2004	New Haven, CT	Yale Univ Sch Med, Int Org Solid State Dosimetry, Oxford Univ Press, Landauer Inc, Canberra Ind, Global Dosimetry Solut Inc			RADON; U-238; DECAY	Commercial hair gel material (polyvinyl pyrolydone triethanolamine carbopol in water) and bacteriological agar (phycocolloid extracted from a group of red-purple algae, usually Gelidium sp.) have been studied as radioactive radon gas detectors. The detection method is based on the diffusion of the radioactive gas in the gel material, and the subsequent measurement of trapped products of the natural decay of radon by gamma spectrometry. From the several radon daughters with gamma radiation emission (Pb-214, Bi-214, Po-214, Pb-210, Po-210), two elements, Pb-214 (0.352 MeV) and Bi-214 (0.609 MeV), were chosen for the analysis in this work; in order to determine the best sensitivity, corrections were made for the short half-life of the analysed isotopes. For the gamma spectrometry analysis, a hyperpure germanium solid state detector was used, associated with a PC multichannel analyser card with Maestro((R)) and Microsoft((R)) Excel((R)) software. The results show the viability of the method: a linear response in a wide radon concentration range (450-10,000 Bq m(-3)), reproducibility of data, easy handling and low cost of the gel material. This detection methodology opens new possibilities for measurements of radon and other radioactive gases.

This animal was found in the fossiliferous site at Orosei (Nuoro, Sardinia, Italy) and was endemic in the region. Molar teeth were cleaned and enamel was completely removed from dentine. Enamel was irradiated with a (60)Co gamma source and measured with an ESR spectrometer (X-band) to obtain the signal vs. dose curve and fitted with an exponential function. The archeological dose obtained by the fitting was 211 +/- 34 Gy. Uranium and thorium concentrations were determined by neutron activation analysis. With the software ROSY the age estimates were 195 +/- 30 ky for early uptake, 247 +/- 40 ky for linear uptake and 243 +/- 40 ky for a combination of uptake processes.

The uncertainty values are derived for the calculation of the efficiency, the partial gamma-ray production cross-section and the component mass. It is shown that using the relative method of PGAA, the uncertainty values can be significantly reduced, especially taking into consideration the correlation between the efficiencies at close-lying energies. A method is proposed for the calculation of uncertainties of concentrations from those of component masses. The procedure is shown in an example and recommendations are given for keeping the uncertainties and error propagation of results originating from different laboratories under control.

Cascade subcritical liquid-salt reactor for burning transplutonium actinides	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								A cascade subcritical liquid-salt reactor designed for burning long-lived components of the radioactive wastes of the nuclear fuel cycle is examined. The cascade scheme of the reactor makes it possible to decrease by a factor of three the power of the driving accelerator as compared with coventional accelerator-blanket systems of equal power The fuel composition of the reactor consists of 20% Np, Am, On, and other transplutonium elements and 80% plutonium, which are dissolved in a salt melt NaF(50%)-ZrF4(50%). For a 10 MW proton accelerator, 1 GeV proton energy (10 mA current) and subcriticality depth 0.05, the thermal power of the reactor is 800 MW which permits burning similar to 70 kg/yr Np, Am, On, and other transplutonium actinides, i.e., service five VVER type reactors of equal power.

The method is based on a combination of the alpha-Rossi method and the multiplying source method with a calculation of the corresponding isotopic-spatial correlation factor. The effective neutron multiplication coefficients in plutonium blocks are measured. The range of determination of the effective multiplication coefficients was 0.3-0.45. The measured effective neutron multiplication coefficients in plutonium blocks agree well with the computational results. The effective neutron multiplication coefficients in the MATR subcritical assembly with VVER fuel elements were measured for different water levels. The range of determination of the effective multiplication coefficients was 0.7-0.97. The measured effective neutron multiplication coefficients agree with the results obtained using the shooting-source method.

Design of casks accommodating vitrified waste	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								5309 t HM of spent fuel from German nuclear power plants have been shipped for reprocessing to France, and 768 t HM to the UK, so far. Conditioned waste from reprocessing (glass canisters and canisters with compacted solid waste) are returned to Germany as agreed upon. Pending their final storage they are kept in approx. 400 shipping and storage casks in interim stores at Ahaus and Gorleben. The first HLW shipment within the return program was carried out in May 1996. To this day, 63 casks from France have been shipped to the Gorleben interim store (TBL-G) and emplaced there. As a result of reprocessing of fuel with higher burnup, waste will have to be returned in the future which will have higher thermal power levels and higher activity inventories. New casks with the appropriate design characteristics have been developed by GNS Gesellschaft fir Nuklear-Service and TN International (AREVA Group) for these future shipments. The Castor (R) HAW28M newly developed by GNS is still in its approval procedure, which will be completed most probably by late 2006. The TN 85 cask received its approval under transport regulations in Germany in March 2006; the storage permit is also expected to be issued still in the course of this year. Experience in the development, approval (transport and storage regulations) and use so far of HLW casks for vitrified waste is presented. The article focuses on the Castor (R) HAW28M and TN 85 cask developments.

Two different design shapes (Models A and B) were considered. The transmutation zone (TZ), which contains the mixture of TRU nuclides (10%), was located in the modified blankets. The volume fraction of Pu in the mixture is raised from 0 to 40% stepped by 10% to determine its effect on the B/T. The fuel spheres were cladded with SiC (5%) and cooled with high-pressured helium gas (85%) for nuclear heat transfer. The calculations were performed for an operation period (OP) of up to 10 years by 75% plant factor (17) under a neutron wall load (P) of 4.7 MW/m(2). The results bring out that: (1) the Model B transmutes the TRUs more rapidly than the Model A; (2) the effective half-lives decrease about 20 and 40% with the increase of Pu fraction in the cases of Models A and B, respectively; (3) the M values are quite high with respect to the M value of the original PROMETHEUS fusion reactor; (4) the blankets can produce substantial electricity in situ.

Analysis of an ex-vessel break in the ITER divertor cooling loop	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						ECART code; fusion reactors safety; ITER; LOCA	CODE	In the present work the integrated ECART code, developed for severe accident analysis in LWRs, is applied on the analysis of a large ex-vessel break in the divertor cooling loop of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER). A comparison of the ECART results with those obtained by Studsvik Nuclear AB (S), utilizing the MELCOR code, was also performed in the general framework of the quality assurance program for the ITER accident analyses. This comparison gives a good agreement in the results, both for thermal-hydraulics and the environmental radioactive releases. Mainly these analyses, from the point of view of the ITER safety, confirm that the accidental overpressure inside the vacuum vessel and the Tokamak cooling water system (TWCS) Vault is always well below the design limits and that the radioactive releases are adequately confined below the ITER guidelines.

New classes of quasi-axisymmetric stellarator configurations	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th International Stellarator Workshop	OCT 03-07, 2005	Lab Nacl Fus, CIEMAT, Madrid, SPAIN		Lab Nacl Fus, CIEMAT	stellarator; quasi-axisymmetry; configuration optimization	COMPACT STELLARATORS; TOKAMAK TRANSPORT	We have identified and developed new classes of quasi-axially symmetric configurations that have attractive properties from the standpoint of both near-term physics experiments and long-term power-producing reactors. These include configurations with very small aspect ratios (similar to 2.5) having superior quasi-symmetry and energetic particle confinement characteristics, and configurations with strongly negative global magnetic shear from the shaping fields so that the overall rotational transform, when combined with the transform from bootstrap currents at finite plasma pressures, will have a small but positive shear, making the avoidance of low-order rational surfaces at a given operating beta possible. Additionally, we have found configurations with National Compact Stellarator Experiment-like characteristics but with the biased components in the magnetic spectrum that allow us to improve the confinement of energetic particles. For each new class of configurations, we have also designed coils to ensure that the new configurations are realizable and engineering-wise feasible. The coil designs typically have the properties of R/Delta(min)(C-P)<= 6 and R/Delta(min)(C-C)<= 10, where R is the plasma major radius and Delta(min)(C-P) and Delta(min)(C-C) are the minimum coil-to-plasma and coil-to-coil separations, respectively. These coil properties allow power-producing reactors to be designed with R<9 m for deuterium-tritium plasmas with a full breeding blanket. The good quasi-axisymmetry limits the energy loss of alpha particles to below 10%.

The sources of water comprise hand pumps and tube wells. Uranium concentration in the water samples from Punjab varies from 1.39 +/- 0.16 to 98.25 +/- 2.06 ppb with a mean value of 19.84 +/- 0.87 ppb. The uranium concentration in most of the drinking water samples from Punjab exceeds the safe limit recommended by the World Health Organization. However, the uranium concentration in water samples from Himachal Pradesh is well within the recommended levels. The annual effective dose equivalent associated with drinking water due to uranium concentration is estimated from its annual intake using dosimetric information based on ICRP Report 72. The resulting value of the annual effective dose from drinking water sources is in the range of 0.13 to 81.59 mu Sv. The annual effective dose received by the population due to the consumption of drinking water from these areas is well within the recommended limit. In order to check the accuracy of the technique a few water samples were also analyzed using a fission track registration technique. A good agreement has been observed between the uranium values determined by these techniques.

Evaluation of the potential absorbed doses from patients based on whole-body I-131 clearance in thyroid cancer therapy	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						thyroid; cancer; I-131; dose; absorbed		The evaluation of the absorbed dose from radioactive patients during the treatment of thyroid disease is an important factor in establishing precautions in these procedures, and the I-131 retention/excretion by patients' bodies provides additional information to medical and radioprotection service. In 94 patients, the measurement of exposure rates was performed over 7 d following Na I-131 administration, and the rates permitted the study of the dynamics of excretion and the potential dose evaluation. The administered activities ranged from 3.7 GBq (100 mCi) to 16.65 GBq (450 mCi), and the results proved that the majority of the activity is excreted by patients in the first 3 d after Na 1311 administration. The average I-131 activity excreted at 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h after oral administration was (72 +/- 10), (91 +/- 6), (97 +/- 3), (98.9 +/- 1.5), and (99.6 +/- 0.7) %, respectively. According to the administered activity, the evaluation of the accumulated absorbed dose from patients ranged from 3.0 +/- 0.7 to 8.4 +/- 1.1 mSv at 1 in and 1.2 +/- 0.4 to 3.2 +/- 0.4 mSv at 2 in.

Application of multi-compartment wound models to plutonium-contaminated wounds incurred by former workers at Rocky Flats	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						plutonium; modeling; dose assessment; bioassay; intake; radionuclide	EXCRETION; RETENTION; PU	This paper presents the analysis of urine bioassay data, spanning four decades, from five workers who had wounds contaminated with plutonium at the Department of Energy Rocky Flats Plant during the period 1961-1967. The cases were selected from participants in the Department of Energy-sponsored Former Radiation Worker Medical Surveillance Program at Rocky Flats, which provided medical monitoring, modern bioassay measurements, and internal dose re-evaluations for former Rocky Flats workers. The cases include a variety of wound types, excision treatment regimes, and monitoring information. These wound cases illustrate the use of two multi-compartment wound models and three plutonium urine excretion models for retrospective calculation of internal plutonium depositions resulting from wounds for which no chelation therapy was administered. Wound model compartment fractions and half times are determined for each case and urine excretion model as are composite parameter values. The urine analysis and wound count measurements obtained udder the program provide data with state-of-the art measurement sensitivity, as well as the opportunity to include long-term excretion and wound site data that exceed 10,000 d post-exposure for retrospective intake and dose evaluations. These data are provided to the radiation dosimetry community for use in developing and testing improved models for plutonium deposition in wounds.

Uranium concentrations were measured with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry after microwave-assisted digestion and online separation using the UTEVA extraction chromatographic resin. The concentrations ranged from 0.8 to 35.6 ng of uranium per liter of urine (median 4.5 ng L-1). Urinary uranium was normalized relative to the creatinine concentration in order to compensate for the degree of urine dilution. Creatinine-normalized values ranged from 1.2 to 17.8 ng of uranium per gram of creatinine (median 7.4 ng g(-1) creatinine). These results corresponded to the lower end of urinary uranium reported for unexposed populations. The level of daily excreted uranium was calculated as 6.45 ng d(-1) (median value) using ICRP recommended values for 24-h creatinine excretion. These data along with literature data on uranium dietary intake for Japanese populations were used to estimate the uranium gastrointestinal absorption fraction (f(1)). The median f(1) value was calculated to be 0.007. Statistical analysis was done to investigate statistical differences and relationships between the studied variables.

The phone from the explosions and fires was highly radioactive and resulted in very high exposure levels in the surrounding regions. This paper describes how the people in Kiev, Ukraine, a city, 120 km (90 miles) south of Chernobyl, and in particular one individual in that city Professor Vitaly Eremenko, became aware of the threat before the official announcement and the steps he took to mitigate potential impacts to his immediate family. The combination of being informed and using available resources led to greatly reduced consequences for his family and, in particular, his newborn granddaughter. He notes how quickly word of the some aspects of the hazard spread in the city and how other aspects appear to not have been understood. Although these events are being recalled as the 20(th) anniversary of the terrible event approaches, the lessons are still pertinent today. Threats of possible terrorist use of radiation dispersal devices makes knowledge of effective individual actions for self-protection from radiation exposures a topic of current interest.

Modeling a potential atmospheric release from a waste disposal facility at the Savannah River Site as an area source	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topic; dose assessment; environmental transport; waste disposal		The Saltstone Facility was designed at the Savannah River Site (SRS) to treat and dispose of certain low-level liquid radioactive wastes. The final product of Saltstone is several large concrete vaults. As part of the performance assessment for Saltstone, reduction of dose to receptors downwind of the vaults have been estimated for treating the vaults as an area atmospheric source as opposed to a point source. The CAP88 model has the ability to handle area sources, but the methods are not appropriate for receptors close to the source such as those modeled at 100 m. Use of the area source as opposed to the point source can reduce the dose by as much as a factor of 5 depending on vault size. A method for quickly assessing the dose from an area source for near-in exposures is demonstrated here.
