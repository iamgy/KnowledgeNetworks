The neutrons around the primary cooling pipe during normal operation of HANARO are measured with BF3 detector, and their count rate is 900 cps. They are regarded as photoneutrons due to the high energy gamma-rays from N-16 and delayed neutrons from the fission of the uranium contaminated on the fuel surface. The contribution of each neutron source is analyzed by measuring the changes of the neutron counts before and after the abrupt shutdown of reactor. In order to estimate the sensitivity of the fuel failure detection, the neutron count rate of BF3 detector is predicted by Monte Carlo calculation. The generation, transportation and detection of the photoneutrons and the delayed neutrons are simulated for the geometry similar to the experiments. From the calculations and experiments, it is ascertained that the photoneutron contribution to the total count rate is about 20-30%, and that the delayed neutron count rate is expected to about 720 cps. The fission rate in the flow tube of the reactor core by the surface contamination is obtained from the deduced delayed neutron count rate, and it is estimated to 1.66 x 10(5) fissions/ cm(3) s. From the MCNP calculation, it is confirmed that this fission rate can originate from the contaminated uranium of 120 mu g, which is about 13% of the maximum allowable surface contamination on the fuel surface. The sensitivity of U-235 mass detection by the delayed neutron measurement can be concluded to about 0.2 mu g-U-235/CPS. Thus, it is confirmed that the delayed neutron detection is sensitive enough to monitor the fuel failure, and that the neutron count rate is high enough for stable signal with short counting time.

Verification of the Lagrangian particle model using the ETEX experiment	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							LONG-RANGE DISPERSION; HORIZONTAL DIFFUSION; SENSITIVITY; HEIGHT	A Lagrangian particle model named LADAS (Long-range Accident Dose Assessment System) has been developed to understand the characteristics of the long-range transport and diffusion of a radioactive material released into the atmosphere. The developed numerical model was compared with the results of European Tracer Experiment (ETEX) which is a long-range field tracer experiment. Several simulations were performed to investigate the effects according to the variation of the mixing height. As a comparative study, the calculated concentration distributions agreed well in the case of the usage of the mixing height calculated by the Richardson number than the usage of the constant mixing height in the computational domain. The calculated particle cloud represented well the phenomenon that was transported north-westerly from a release point such as the ETEX results. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Neutron flux optimization in irradiation channels at NUR research reactor	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								Optimization of neutron fluxes in experimental channels is of great concern in research reactor utilization. The general approach used at the NUR research reactor for neutron flux optimization in irradiation channels is presented. The approach is essentially based upon a judicious optimization of the core configuration combined with the improvement of reflector characteristics. The method allowed to increase the thermal neutron flux for radioisotope production purposes by more than 800%. Increases of up to 60% are also observed in levels of useful fluxes available for neutron diffraction experiments (small angle neutron scattering (SANS), neutron reflectometry, etc.). Such improvements in the neutronic characteristics of the NUR reactor opened new perspectives in terms of its utilization. More particularly, it is now possible to produce at industrial scales major radio-isotopes for medicine and industry and to perform, for the first time, material testing experiments. The cost of the irradiations in the optimized configuration is generally small when compared to those performed in the old configuration and an average reduction factor of about of 10 is expected in the case of production of Molybdenum-99 (isotope required for the manufacturing of Technetium-99 medical kits). In addition to these important results, safety analysis studies showed that the more symmetrical nature of the core geometry leads to a more adequately balanced reactivity control system and contributes quite efficiently to the operational safety of the NUR reactor. Results of comparisons between calculations and measurements for a series of parameters of importance in reactor operation and safety showed good agreement. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In the past, many experts have used a physical mock-up system to find the exact work processes and the working positions. Nowadays, these jobs are being done by a Digital Mock-Up (DMU) system. The DMU, which is a technology to realize an effective work process by using virtual environments through representing the physical and logical schema and the behavior of a real decommissioning work, can save on the cost and time, reduce the risk of making later changes, and develop various decommissioning scenarios. In this research, a decommissioning DMU system was developed for simulating the relevant dismantling processes. Decommissioning data-computing modules which can calculate a dismantling schedule, quantify a radioactive waste, visualize a radioactive inventory, estimate a decommissioning cost, and estimate a worker's exposure were also developed to qualitatively assess the decommissioning information. And an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model was developed to evaluate the decommissioning scenarios which reflected the quantitative and qualitative considerations. To establish the proper scenario for the thermal column in KRR-1, the developed decommissioning DMU system was applied to evaluate the two candidate scenarios of it. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A theoretical model for the production of Ac-225 for cancer therapy by photon-induced transmutation of Ra-226	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						medical linear accelerator (linac); actinium-225; radium-226; radium-225; bismuth-213; targeted alpha therapy; cancer therapy		Radium needles that were once implanted into tumours as a cancer treatment are now obsolete and constitute a radioactive waste problem, as their half-life is 1600 years. We are investigating the reduction of radium by transmutation on a small scale by bombarding Ra-226 with high-energy photons from a medical linear accelerator (linac) to produce Ra-225, which subsequently decays to Ac-225, which can be used as a generator to produce Bi-213 for use in 'targeted alpha therapy' for cancer. This paper examines the possibility of producing Ac-225 with a linac using an accurate theoretical model in which the bremsstrahlung photon spectrum at 18 MV linac electron energy is convoluted with the corresponding photonuclear cross sections of Ra-226. The total integrated yield can then be obtained and is compared with a computer simulation. This study shows that at 18 MV, the photonuclear reaction on Ra-226 can produce low activities of Ac-225 with a linac.

Cyclotron production of Cu-64 by deuteron irradiation of Zn-64	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Cu-64; Cu-61; Ga-66; Ga-67; target yield; radioisotope production; cyclotron; PET; therapy	INDUCED NUCLEAR-REACTIONS; EXCITATION-FUNCTIONS; COPPER-64	The short-lived (12.7 h half_life) Cu-64 radioisotope is both a beta(+) and a beta(-) emitter. This property makes 64Cu a promising candidate for novel medical applications, since it can be used simultaneously for therapeutic application of radiolabelled biomolecules and for diagnosis with PET. Following previous work on Cu-64 production by deuteron irradiation of natural zinc, we report here the production of this radioisotope by deuteron irradiation of enriched Zn-64. In addition, yields of other radioisotopes such as (CU)-C-61, (CU)-C-67, Zn-65, Zn-69m, Ga-66 and Ga-67, which were co-produced in this process, were also measured. The evaporation code ALICE-91 and the transport code SRIM 2003 were used to determine the excitation functions and the stopping power, respectively. All the nuclear reactions yielding the above-mentioned radioisotopes were taken into account in the calculations both for the natural and enriched Zn targets. The experimental and calculated yields were shown to be in reasonable agreement. The work was carried out at the Scanditronix MC-40 Cyclotron of the Institute for Health and Consumer Protection of the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (Ispra site, Italy). The irradiations were carried out with 19.5 MeV deuterons, the maximum deuteron energy obtainable with the MC-40 cyclotron. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Optimized background reduction in low-level gamma-ray spectrometry at a surface laboratory	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						gamma spectrometry; background reduction; anticoincidence	GERMANIUM-SPECTROMETER; DETECTORS; GE; RADIOACTIVITY; SIMULATION	The background of a coaxial Ge detector placed at a surface laboratory has been reduced by means of a background reduction setup consisting of a passive shield of low-activity lead, a simple radon suppression system and an active shield with a plastic scintillation plate. In particular, we have devoted our efforts to in-depth optimization of each parameter associated with different anticoincidence setups and to their subsequent intercomparison. The overall performance of the active shield was improved by using the optimum time parameters for each setup. The final objective is to decrease the cosmic-ray background and, by this way, to reduce the detection limits of gamma-ray spectrometers at conventional laboratories, and consequently make them competitive for different measurements like Pb-210 dating.

Influence of the soil bioavailability of radionuclides on the transfer of uranium and thorium to mushrooms	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						fungi; transfer; uranium; thorium	ALPHA-EMITTERS; FUNGI TRANSFER; RADIOCESIUM; CS-137; SPAIN; ACCUMULATION; AVAILABILITY; FOREST; SR-90	The soil-mushroom transfer of thorium and uranium was analyzed in two ecologically similar but geographically separated Spanish ecosystems by means of the transfer factor, TF. Uranium TF values were in the range 0.043-0.49, and thorium TF values in the range 0.030-0.62. These values were similar to those of Sr-90, Pu239+240, and Am-241 found previously in the same ecosystems. Given the low availability of uranium and thorium, the available transfer factors, ATF, were also determined. These were higher than the TF values by one order of magnitude for U-234,U-238, and by 2-3 orders of magnitude for Th-228,Th-210,Th-232. The ATF value of thorium was similar to that of Cs-137, and that of uranium similar to that of K-40. Hebeloma cylindrosporum presented the highest uranium and thorium transfer factors, confirming this species as a good bioindicator of a soil's radioactive content. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

TLC combined with radioactivity detection is rapid, simple, and relatively flexible. Here, F-18-labelled synthesis products were analyzed by TLC and the radioactivity distribution on the plates determined using the three techniques. Radioactivity scanning is appropriate only with good chromatographic resolution and previously validated scanning parameters. Film autoradiography exhibits poor linearity if radioactivity varies greatly. PSL provides high sensitivity and resolution and superior linearity compared with the other methods.

The method of high-efficiency gamma counting by means of well-type HPGe and NaI (T1) detectors is widely used and has proved a powerful tool, particularly when low-activity, small-volume environmental samples are to be analyzed by gamma-ray spectrometry. In the present work, we introduce a direct analytical method for calculating the solid angle subtended by a well-type detector at axial point, non-axial point, extended circular disk and cylindrical sources.

Calibration of cylindrical detectors using a simplified theoretical approach	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						gamma spectroscopy; HPGe detector; NaI(Tl) detector; photon path length	INCLUDING SELF-ABSORPTION; GAMMA-RAY SPECTROMETRY/; TO-PEAK RATIO; TOTAL EFFICIENCY; COINCIDENCE CORRECTIONS; DISK SOURCES; SCINTILLATORS	The calibration of cylindrical detectors using different types of radioactive sources is a matter of routine. The most accurate method, that of experiment, is limited by several factors when the energy interval is, broad, requiring a relatively large number of primary standards, implying considerable investment of money and time. Several other techniques can be used instead, including Monte Carlo simulations and semi-empirical methods. Calculations based on the first technique require good definition of the geometry and materials, including the dead layer and window thickness together with an accurate set of cross-sections. The second technique requires two different types of experimental input, the first being from use of sources emitting cascade 7 rays and the second from use of sources emitting isolated 7 rays in order to cover the wide energy range and provide coincidence-summing corrections, respectively. Here, we introduce a new theoretical approach based on the Direct Statistical method proposed by Selim and Abbas to calculate the total and the full-energy peak (photopeak) efficiencies for both point and thin circular disk sources for scintillation and semiconductor detectors. The present method combines calculation of the average path length covered by the photon inside the detector active volume and the geometrical solid angle Omega, to obtain a simple formula for the different efficiencies. Results from the present model were tested against data sets obtained with previous treatments in order to underline how simple and fast our calculations are. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Identifying spectrometric signatures of phosphate deposits and enclosing sediments in Al-Awabed area, Northern Palmyrides, Central Syria, by the use of statistical factor analysis	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article								in previous published research, a factor analysis approach has been applied to airborne spectrometric data of Al-Awabed area, Northern Palmyrides, Syria. A model of four factors (F1, F2, F3 and F4) has proven to be sufficient to represent the acquired data, where 94% of the total data variance is explained. A powerful tool for direct differentiation of various rocks units is obtained through the mapping of these four factors, where a scored lithological map including 11 radiometric units is established. Ninty nine rock samples have been taken according to the four factors to be analyzed by the gamma-spectrometry technique in order to determine their content of eU, eTh and K%. The analysis of 65 samples according to F I indicates that uranium concentration varies between 2.74 and 123.3 ppm with an average of 58.85 ppm and a standard deviation of 32.53 ppm. The analysis of 18 samples taken according to F2 indicates that K% concentration varies between 0.001 and 0.324 with an average of 0.145 and a standard deviation of 0.122. The analysis of 16 samples taken according to F3 indicates that K% concentration varies between 0.024 and 0.558 with an average of 0.227 and a standard deviation of 0.133. These gamma-results are expected and fit very well with the results obtained by the factor analysis approach. Therefore, the validity and efficacy of the factor analysis approach, to be widely used as a guide in exploration and smart sampling for mining programs, are well demonstrated. The established phosphate maps show a width extension and distribution, and clearly indicate the potential of the research area, and it merits to be followed by economic exploration.

Accounting and monitoring of materials in the nuclear fuel cycle	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The main drawback of the existing normative base of the systems used for accounting for monitoring, and physical protection of radioactive substances and wastes is that these systems ignore the experience which has been accumulated for nuclear materials. It is proposed in the present paper that the program-technological complexes used in the accounting and monitoring systems be unified and that the successful experience in developing such complexes at the Russian Science Center Kurchatov Institute in the form of the KI-MAKS system, which makes it possible to solve the problems of automatically accounting for, monitoring, and reporting on nuclear materials and radioactive substances and wastes, be utilized. It is shown that all affective solution of the problems of accounting for monitoring, and physical protection in terms of cost-effectiveness call be attained by using the existing program-technological complex called a probabilistic expert-consulting system, which makes it possible to perform a quantitative analysis-of the level of the safety culture in the nuclear fuel cycle.

Assessment of the quality and activity of the radionuclides in the fuel cycles of a three-component structure of nuclear power	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								A three-component structure of nuclear power with a closed nuclear fuel cycle is examined. In addition to the existing thermal and fast reactors the system contains a liquid-salt reactor for closing the fuel cycle with respect to actinides. The quantity and activity of the radionuclides are analyzed for promising variants of the structure of nuclear power and the uranitun-plutonium, thoriun-uranium, and uranium-plutoiumthorium closed fuel cycle. It is concluded on the basis of calculations and analysis, taking into account the life cycle from production of the fuel to the burial of the wastes, that the uranium-plutonium-thorium fuel cycle is more advantageous than the uranium-plutonium and thorium-uranium fuel cycles.

Parametric neutronic analysis of HCLL blanket for DEMO fusion reactor utilizing vacuum vessel ITER FDR design	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						tritium breeding ratio; blanket and shielding performance; HCLL; DEMO reactor; epoxy insulator		Three-dimensional parametric neutronics calculations using the Monte Carlo code MCNP-4C have been performed for a DEMO-type reactor based on the Helium-Cooled Lithium-Lead (HCLL) blanket. The aim of the analysis was to minimize the radial blanket thickness, while ensuring tritium self-sufficiency and to assess the shielding performance of the reactor in terms of the radiation loads to the super-conducting toroidal field (TF) coils. It was found that tritium self-sufficiency can be achieved with a breeder zone thickness reduced to no more than 55 cm at a Li-6 enrichment of 90%. Assuming a Li-6 enrichment of 60%, a breeder zone thickness of 60cm is required to achieve the target TBR of 1.10 which is assumed to be sufficient to cover potential tritium losses and uncertainties. With regard to the shielding performance it was found that the design limits for the radiation loads to the TF-coil can be met with radial blanket thicknesses of 75 cm, 60 cm and 55 cm utilizing a two-component shield of Eurofer steel and tungsten carbide between the breeder zone and the vacuum vessel. The blanket variants with larger radial breeder zone show better shielding performances due to the reduced Eurofer shielding material acting as gamma radiation emitter in between the breeder zone and the vacuum vessel. In particular the radiation dose absorbed in the Epoxy insulator was shown to be the most critical quantity in this regard. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Irshad, H; Su, WC; Cheng, YS; Medici, F				Irshad, Hammad; Su, Wei-Chung; Cheng, Yung S.; Medici, Fausto			Testing of high-volume sampler inlets for the sampling of atmospheric radionuclides	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						radionuclide; air sampling; aerosols; monitoring, air	PERFORMANCE; PARTICLES; FALLOUT	Sampling of air for radioactive particles is one of the most important techniques used to determine the nuclear debris from a nuclear weapon test in the Earth's atmosphere or those particles vented from underground or underwater tests. Massive-flow air samplers are used to sample air for any indication of radionuclides that are a signature of nuclear tests. The International Monitoring System of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization includes seismic, hydroacoustic, infrasound, and gaseous xenon isotopes sampling technologies, in addition to radionuclide sampling, to monitor for any violation of the treaty. Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute has developed a large wind tunnel to test the outdoor radionuclide samplers for the International Monitoring System. The inlets for these samplers are tested for their collection efficiencies for different particle sizes at various wind speeds. This paper describes the results from the testing of two radionuclide sampling units used in the International Monitoring System. The possible areas of depositional wall losses are identified and the losses in these areas are determined. Sampling inlet type 1 was tested at 2.2 in s(-1) wind speed for 5, 10, and 20-mu m aerodynamic diameter particles. The global collection efficiency was about 87.6% for 10-mu m particles for sampling inlet type 1. Sampling inlet type 2 was tested for three wind speeds at 0.56, 2.2, and 6.6 in s(-1) for 5, 10, and 20-mu m aerodynamic diameter particles in two different configurations (sampling head lowered and raised).

National survey on the natural radioactivity and Rn-222 exhalation rate of building materials in the Netherlands	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						Rn-222, indoor; radioactivity, natural; spectrometry, gamma; exhalation	RADON EXHALATION; CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS; GAMMA-RADIATION; CONCRETE; DWELLINGS; DIFFUSION	The present study reports on results of a nationwide survey on the natural radioactivity concentrations and Rn-222 exhalation rates of the prevailing building materials in the Netherlands. In total 100 samples were taken and analyzed for the activity concentrations of Ra-226, Ra-228, Th-228, and K-40 and for their Rn-222 exhalation rate. The sampled materials consisted of gypsum products, aerated concrete, sand-lime and clay bricks, mortars and concrete, representing about 95% of the stony building materials used in the construction of Dutch homes. The laboratory analyses were performed according to two well-documented standard procedures, the interlaboratory reproducibility of which is found to be within 5% on average. The highest radionuclide concentrations were found in a porous inner wall brick to which fly ash was added. The second highest were clay bricks with average Ra-226 and Ra-228 levels around 40 Bq kg(-1). Concrete and mortar show the highest exhalation rates with a fairly broad range of 1 to 13 mu Bq (kg s)(-1). Low natural radioactivity levels are associated with either natural gypsum (products) or gypsum from flue gas desulphurization units, and low exhalation rates with clay bricks. To evaluate the radiological impact the radioactivity concentrations in each sample were combined into a so-called dose factor, representing the absorbed dose rate in a room with a floor, walls and ceiling of 20 cm of the material in question. For that purpose, calculations with the computer codes MCNP, Marmer and MicroShield on the specific absorbed dose rates were incorporated in the paper. The results of these codes corresponded within 6% and average values were calculated at 0.90, 1.10, and 0.080 nGy h(-1) per Bq kg(-1) for the U-238 series, the Th-232 series, and K-40, respectively. Model calculations on the external dose rate, based on the incidence of the various building materials in 1,336 living rooms, are in accordance with measured data.

Significance of C-14 and Ra-228 in terms of the proposed Yucca Mountain high-level radioactive waste repository	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						Yucca Mountain; C-14; Ra-228; groundwater		C-14 and Ra-228 are two of the radionuclides that have either been identified as being potentially significant in terms of releases from the proposed Yucca Mountain high-level radioactive waste repository, or are specifically cited for consideration and evaluation in the regulations promulgated by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The purpose of this study was to estimate the concentrations and associated doses for these two radionuclides, if released under conditions of a scenario assumed to apply to a repository containing some of the features of the one proposed at Yucca Mountain, NV, and to compare these estimates to the regulatory limits for that facility. For C-14, the postulated condition was that an annual fractional release of 10(-5) of its total remaining inventory occurs beginning at 10,000 y after repository closure. For Ra-228, the same fractional release rate was assumed, but in this case it was presumed to occur when the Ra-228 inventory was projected to reach a maximum at more than 10(8) y after repository closure. The estimated concentrations and doses were, in turn, compared to the concentration limit, specified in the Ground Water Protection Standards (GWPSs) in the case of Ra-228, or derived, in the case of C-14, on the basis of the regulatory dose rate limit. Due to the small inventory of C-14 in the waste, and its short half-life relative to the performance period evaluated, its estimated concentration in the ground water would be slightly more than 4% of the derived GWPS. Due to the relatively small initial inventory of Th-232, the precursor of Ra-228, and the correspondingly small quantities of higher atomic number actinides that could, through decay, produce additional quantities of Th-232, its estimated concentration in the ground water would be less than 3% of the GWPS, leaving the remaining portion of the limit for potential contributions from Ra-226. At the same time, however, it must be recognized that, in this case, the regulations require that any contributions of naturally occurring Ra-226 and Ra-228 already present in the ground water must be included in the determination of compliance. If this is done, the total concentration of Ra-228, combined with the naturally occurring concentration of Ra-226, would be about 10.5% of the limit. In a similar manner, the committed doses due to the annual consumption of each of these two radionuclides in ground water and food, produced in the local biosphere, were evaluated in terms of the Individual Protection Standard (IPS). Based on these analyses, the estimated effective dose for C-14, using the coefficients in Federal Guidance Report (FGR) No. 13, was 4.15 mu Sv y(-1), less than 3% of the IPS. For Ra-228, the comparable estimate at the time of maximum inventory, excluding in this case the contributions from naturally occurring Ra-226 and Ra-228, was 7.39 mu Sv y(-1), representing about 5% of the IPS. Based on the value assumed for the fractional release rate (10(-5) y(-1)), it was concluded that neither C-14 nor Ra-228 will be significant in terms of either the applicable GWPS or the IPS. While it was recognized that, due to the time spans involved, these analyses were primarily an academic exercise, it is believed that the perspectives and accompanying insights are useful.

External doses to humans from Cs-137 in soil	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						Cs-137; soil; dose, external; dose, absorbed		Calculations of absorbed doses in organs of the human body and the total effective dose due to Cs-137 in soil as a source of external exposure are presented in this work. Calculations were done using the MCNP-4B software package. The assumption was made that photons with an energy of 662 keV are emitted in a cylindrical volumetric source in soil up to the depth of 20 cm. Depth distributions of Cs-137 at 19 locations around KraguJevac (a city in central Serbia) were measured by a HPGe detector. An ORNL phantom of an adult human standing on the soil above the center of a cylindrical radioactive source was used to calculate the conversion coefficients, i.e., absorbed doses in an organ per unit specific activity. The conversion coefficients in organs are given as a function of the source depth in soil. The largest absorbed dose was found in skin. The annual effective dose in humans was estimated from these calculations and the measured activity depth profile of Cs-137 in soil. The average effective dose was found to be 3.17 mu Sv y(-1). This value was rather small in comparison with other sources of natural ionizing radiation. One may conclude that Cs-137 was a negligible source of external exposure in the area around the city.

In this study, management of SRS (Co-60, Cs-137) at Cekmece Waste Processing and Storage Facility (CWPSF) is described. Eleven Cs-137 sources (total 851 GBq) and four Co-60 sources (total 27.75 GBq) that had been used as levels and density gauges were conditioned. Reinforced metal drums (200 L in volume) and cement matrix were used for conditioning of these sources. In this way, greater confinement was achieved for long-term storage. Maximum dose rates at the surface of the conditioned waste package were determined. In addition to information about conditioning stages of the sources, various calculations that have been done for shielding are presented. Surface dose rates of the waste packages were 1.60 mSv h(-1) for Cs-117 and 1.63 mSv h(-1) for Co-60. Measurements of the final waste packages were presented to fulfill the requirements (< 2 mSv h(-1)) of transportation according to regulations for the safe transport of radioactive material.

A detailed study of UO2 to U3O8 oxidation phases and the associated rate-limiting steps	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							URANIUM-DIOXIDE; WATER-VAPOR; GROWTH; OXYGEN; U4O9; AIR; NUCLEATION; ALPHA-U3O8; TRANSITION; KINETICS	The kinetic and crystalline evolutions of UO2 during its oxidation into U3O8 at 250 degrees C in air were studied by isothermal thermogravimetry and calorimetry, coupled with an in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction on the D2AM-CRG beamline at ESRF. This study was aimed at determining experimentally the validity of the kinetic assumptions made in existing literature to account for the oxidation Of UO2 into U3O8 and also to determine precisely the structural evolution, in relation to the kinetic behaviour. Our results provide evidence of four distinct kinetic time domains, and the assumption of a single rate-limiting step is verified only for two of them. The crystalline phases associated with these domains are also identified. In fact, the first kinetic domain corresponds to the reaction Of UO2 into U4O9; the second one is linked to the two simultaneous reactions, UO2 into U4O9 and U4O9 into U3O7. Finally, the transition from U3O7 into U3O8 corresponds to the third and fourth kinetic domains. These results show that the oxidation Of UO2 into U3O8 cannot satisfactorily be described with modelling approaches used in the literature. A new general outline is proposed to study the oxidation of uranium oxides. This outline will improve both the understanding and predictions of oxidation processes at the relatively low temperatures that are expected during interim storage of spent nuclear fuel.

Volume changes in delta-plutonium from helium and other decay products	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							METAL-TRITIUM SYSTEMS; ALLOYS; PU; STABILITY; DAMAGE	Small changes in volume are observed in plutonium, and several potential mechanisms have been proposed. In this paper, we provide a detailed theoretical analysis of volume changes due to the accumulation of helium and daughter products generated in the radioactive decay of plutonium. It is shown that volume changes in 8-phase plutonium caused by Am, U. and Np are significant and compensate to some degree the swelling from helium bubble formation and growth. Comparison with experimental results obtained so far suggests that the decay products dominate the rate of volumetric change in the long run. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Ekeroth, E; Roth, O; Jonsson, M				Ekeroth, Ella; Roth, Olivia; Jonsson, Mats			The relative impact of radiolysis products in radiation induced oxidative dissolution of UO2	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							FUEL CORROSION; ONE-ELECTRON; CARBONATE; IRRADIATION; OXIDANTS; URANIUM; MEDIA; WATER	The relative impact of radiolysis products in radiation induced oxidative dissolution Of UO2 has been studied experimentally. The experiments were performed by y-irradiating an aqueous solution containing HCO3 and a UO2-pellet. The U(VI) concentration in the solution was measured as a function of irradiation time. The aqueous solution was saturated with Ar, N2O, N2O/O-2 (80/20), air and O-2 in order to vary the conditions and the initial oxidant yields. The measured rate of oxidation was significantly higher for the O-2- and air saturated systems compared to the other systems. Using oxidant concentrations derived from numerical simulations of the corresponding homogeneous systems and previously determined rate constants for oxidation Of UO2, the relative trend in rate of oxidation in the different systems was reproduced. The results from the simulations were also used to estimate the relative impact of the oxidative radiolysis products as a function of irradiation time, both for gamma- and alpha-irradiated systems. For 7-irradiated systems saturated with Ar, air or 02, the most important oxidant is H2O2 while for N2O- and N2O/O-2-saturated systems the most important oxidant is CO3.-. For a-irradiated systems the most important oxidant was found to be H2O2. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For permeation of hydrogen isotopes through palladium alloy membranes when diffusion is the rate determining step tritium is the least permeating isotope. Since the absolute values of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium permeabilities in palladium differ considerably, the effect could be employed as a basis for technical isotope separation. Using an experimentally verified mathematical model, a parametric computational study was performed to show the net isotope effects in permeate and bleed flows when feeding a technical permeator with various hydrogen isotope mixtures under different feed and permeate pressures. The technical feasibility of hydrogen isotope permeation as a method for separation is discussed with regard to the necessary process control for either a single permeator or a cascade.

The AmN sample was prepared from AmO2 by the carbothermic reduction. The obtained AmN product was grinded and pressed at about 400 MPa to form a disk. The disk was sintered at 1823 K for 10 h in flowing N-2 + 4%H-2 gas. The thermal diffusivity slightly decreased from 3.4 x 10(-6) to 2.8 x 10(-6) m(2)/S with increasing temperature. As the specific heat capacity of AmN was not available in literature, the thermal conductivity of AmN was tentatively estimated from the measured thermal diffusivity, bulk density and the specific heat capacity of PuN. It was found that the thermal conductivity of AmN slightly increased with temperature.

Xenon versus helium behavior in UO2 single crystals: A TEM investigation	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							URANIUM-DIOXIDE; RADIATION-DAMAGE; FISSION-PRODUCTS; DIFFUSION; TEMPERATURE; IRRADIATION; PLUTONIUM; ZIRCONIA; RELEASE; DISKS	The behavior of He and Xe implanted into UO2 single crystals is studied by in situ TEM experiments before and after annealing up to 700 degrees C. TEM micrographs show that annealing induces the formation of noble-gas bubbles in both cases. However, the size (similar to 25 nm for He and 3-5 nm for Xe) and the nucleation temperature (-600 degrees C for He and -400 degrees C for Xe) of bubbles depend on implanted species. These results are explained by the radiation damage produced by ion implantation (different by a factor of 100 for the two elements) and the diffusion mechanisms involved in each case.

Density changes in plutonium observed from accelerated aging using Pu-238 enrichment	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							SELF-IRRADIATION; RADIATION-DAMAGE; ALLOYS	In support of Stockpile Stewardship activities, accelerated aging tests on a plutonium alloy enriched with 7.3 at.% of (238)Pu is underway using dilatometry at 35, 50, and 65 degrees C and immersion density measurements of materials stored at 50 degrees C. Changes in density are expected from radiation damage in the lattice and helium in-growth. After 25 equivalent years of aging, the dilatometry data shows that the alloys at 35 degrees C have expanded in volume by 0.11-0.12% and have started to exhibit a near linear expansion behavior primarily caused by the helium accumulation. The average He-to-vacancy ratio from tested specimens was determined to be around 2.55. The model for the lattice damage and helium in-growth accurately represents the volume swelling at 35 degrees C. The density converted from the dilatometry corresponds well to the decreasing density trend of reference plutonium alloys as a function of time. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thus, conditions are met to implement new fuel managements on the Electricite De France fleet with increased enrichment and irradiation limits. The recycling of plutonium is part of EDF's reprocessing/recycling back-end strategy. Up to now, 20 PWR 900 MW reactors are managed with mixed oxide. EDF is now looking to introduce MOX fuels with a higher plutonium content (MOX Parity management). The implementation of the new fuel managements is a great challenge for EDF, with important stakes: the nuclear KWh cost decrease and the improvement of the plant operation performance.

This can be done by both increasing the fuel weight and optimizing rod internal proper-ties that affect operational margins. Further, there is focus on reducing the consequences of fuel failures. To meet these demands Westinghouse has developed ADOPT (Advanced Doped Pellet Technology) UO2 fuel containing additions of chromium and aluminium oxides. This paper presents results from the extensive investigation program which covered examinations of doped and reference standard pellets both in the manufactured and irradiated states. The additives facilitate pellet densification during sintering and enlarge the pellet grain size. The final manufactured doped pellets reach about 0.5% higher density within a shorter sintering time and a five fold larger grain size compared with standard UO2 fuel pellets. The physical properties of the pellets, including heat capacity, thermal expansion coefficient, melting temperature, thermal diffusivity, have been investigated and differences between the doped and standard UO2 pellets are small. The in-reactor performance of the ADOPT pellets has been investigated in pool-side and hotcell Post Irradiation Examinations (PIEs), as well as in the Studsvik R2 test reactor. The investigations have identified three areas of improved operational behaviour: Reduced fission gas release, improved PCI performance thanks to increased pellet plasticity and higher resistance against post-failure degradation. Fuel segments have been exposed to ramp tests and enhanced power steady-state operation in the Studsvik R2 reactor after base-irradiation to above 30 MWd/kgU in a commercial BWR. ADOPT reveals up to 50% lower fission gas release than standard UO2 pellets. The fuel degradation behaviour has been studied in two oxidizing tests, a thermal-microbalance test and an erosion test under irradiation. The tests show that ADOPT pellets have a reduced rate of fuel washout, as compared to standard UO2 pellets. Fuel rods with ADOPT pellets have been irradiated in several light water reactors (LWRs) since 1999, including two full SVEA-96 Optima2 reloads in 2005.

In-pile performance data of MOX have been obtained, and the peak bum-up of MOX pellet have reached to 66 GWd/tM as of October 2004. MOX fuel temperature is confirmed to have no significant difference compared to UO2, if taking into account adequately for thermal conductivity degradation due to PuO2 addition and bum-up development, and measured fuel temperature agrees well with HB-FINE code calculation up to high bum-up region. Fission gas release of MOX is possibly larger than UO2 based on temperature and pressure assessment. No significant difference is confirmed between SBR and MIMAS MOX on FGR behaviour. MOX fuel swelling rate agrees well with solid swelling rate. Cladding elongation data shows onset of PCMI in high power region. Ramp test data from other experiment programs with various types of MOX fabrication route confirms superior PCI resistance of MOX compared to UO2, due to enhanced creep rate of MOX The irradiation is expected to continue until achieving of 70 GWd/tM (MOX pellet peak).

UO2 or MOX fuel segments irradiated to high burnup in light water reactors are equipped with a fuel thermocouple and a cladding extensometer. Gas lines attached to the end plugs are connected to a high pressure system for pressurisation with argon and a low pressure system for hydraulic diameter measurements to study cladding outward deformation and axial gas communication within the fuel rod. The first experiment of the test series utilised a UO2 fuel segment irradiated in an LWR to 52 MWd/kgUO(2). The test was operated for 4,400 h PWR conditions (155 bar, 310 degrees C) provided by a loop system. The rod was pressurised starting at 205 bar and increasing to 455 bar in steps of 50 bar, while recording fuel centreline temperature and cladding elongation. The hold times at the different pressure levels were long enough to assess temperature trends. The measured rates of fuel temperature increase suggest that the necessary overpressure to cause a discernible lasting temperature change was 130-145 bar, equivalent to a cladding hoop stress of 70-77 MPa.

These efforts have produced large amount of valuable information on in-reactor performance of fuel materials representing current and potential future fuel designs. A large number of thoroughly characterised fuel rods composed of different materials have been irradiated in the Spanish PWR Vandellos II for up to five irradiation cycles achieving rod average bumup of up to 75 MWd/kgU. This paper looks into the fuel pellet performance at high burnup only based on the extensive PIE programme both on-site and in hot-cells carried out over this fuel and other related data on similar fuel rods thus supporting and enriching the conclusions.

The area monitoring system indicated no radiation release, however, damage at the top of fuel channel was found in the following inspection. As fuel integrity is essential for further management, a finite element model was established to evaluate the damage condition. Several component elements including fuel rods, tie plates, and channel were set up and integrated into a full assembly. The analysis results provided the impact force on the fuel assembly and the dynamic response of each component element. The event did result in the damage of fuel channel yet fuel rods fracture was not expected. It's consistent with the inspection observations. There is therefore no concern for future operation such as interim dry storage.

The correlation can be used for UO2 and MOX fuel and at hot zero power and cold zero power transients, account taken for the different initial enthalpy and for the lower ductility at cold conditions. It can also be used for non-zero power transients, provided that a term accounting for the start-up power is incorporated. A probabilistic approach has been attempted for the cold zero power case. For LOCA, a correlation has been derived expressing the LOCA limit as a function of the hydrogen accumulated in the cladding during base irradiation. However, LOCA experimental data exhibit a significant scatter, possibly because results depend on details in the conduct of the tests. Consequently, predictions of LOCA limits vs. burn-up are affected by appreciable uncertainty, and more data derived from testing of high burn-up cladding specimens are needed in order to reach firm conclusions.

The paper presents recent results obtained from the NSRR power burst experiments with high burnup, fuels, and discusses effects of pellet expansion as PCMI (Pellet-Cladding Mechanical Interaction) loading and cladding embrittlement primarily due to hydrogen absorption. Results from the recent four experiments on high burnup (about 60 to 78 MWd/kgU) PWR UO2 rods with advanced cladding alloys showed that the fuel rods with improved corrosion resistance have larger safety margin against the PCMI failure than conventional Zircaloy-4 rods. The tests also suggested that the smaller inventory of inter-granular gas in the pellets with the large grain could reduce the fission gas release during the RIA transient; and high burnup structure in pellet periphery (so-called rim structure) does not have strong effect on reduction of the failure threshold because the PCMI load is produced primarily by solid thermal expansion.

Focused on high burn-up UO2 and MOX fuel behaviour, twelve tests (8 UO2 and 4 MOX) were realized from 1993 to 2000. In all these tests, the influence of grain boundary gas was evidenced and it appeared necessary to perform some estimation of its inventory in irradiated fuel. Such evaluations are presented for the MOX MIMAS/AUC fuel, based on two different approaches: "experimental" and "theoretical." The fission gas amount located at the grain boundaries increases with burn-up in correlation with the production, but also with the initial Pu enrichment, as soon as the agglomerates have reached the full restructuring threshold for the High Burn-up Structure. The consistency with the REP-Na test results is checked, showing that a significant cladding deformation is needed, clearly higher than for UO2 fuel in order to release all the grain boundary gas in RIA. Furthermore, to the fission gas effect, adds the helium's occluded in the irradiated fuel whose amount increases with burn-up, Pu enrichment and Pu-241 and Am-241 initial content.

After a synthesis of the main phenomena which have to be considered in a fission gas model, the MARGARET model is presented. Up to five cavities populations (bubbles nucleated during irradiation or fabrication pores) are taken into account, in addition to the dissolved intra- and intergranular gases. The HBS (High Burnup Structure) formation is also considered. The modeling leads to an ordinary differential equations system (typically of 20 non linear coupled equations), which is solved by the Gear method. The computation time remains reasonably short, which allows validation on the whole set of measurements available, integral ones, as well as local ones.

The burnups of the fuel specimens were 36-86 GWd/tU. The bare fuel specimens were heated up to 600-1,800 degrees C at heating rates of 1.7 to 4,600 degrees C/s. The FGR process strongly depended on fuel burnup (extent of rim structure formation) and heating conditions (heating rate, terminal temperature). At lower heating rates below about 10 degrees C/s, growth and interlinkage of fission gas bubbles controlled FGR only at higher temperatures above the threshold temperatures of 1,2501,450 degrees C, depending on fuel burnup. At higher heating rates above at least 90 degrees C/s, instantaneous FGRs, which originated from the occurrence of microcracks and fuel fragmentation induced by the overpressurization of rim bubbles, arose at higher temperatures above 700 degrees C, only for the high burnup fuels of 74 and 86 GWd/tU with developed rim structure. Almost no FGR was found for non rim-structured fuels, even at the higher terminal temperatures of 1,500-1,800 degrees C.

Processing of bone samples for the determination of ultra low-levels of uranium and plutonium	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							MASS-SPECTROMETRY; AUTOPSY TISSUE; PU-239	We have developed cleanroom compatible techniques for processing bone samples for characterization of their uranium and plutonium content. The bone samples are dried and ashed in quartz crucibles placed inside cleanroom compatible thermal ashing furnaces. The bone ash is dissolved in ultra-pure acids prepared by sub-boiling distillation. The uranium and plutonium in the samples are isolated and purified by ion-exchange chromatography and measured by thermal ionization mass spectrometry. The technique is capable of detecting 74 picograms of U-238 and 8 femtograms of Pu-239 in 100 mg bone ash samples. If the ash contains larger amounts of uranium and plutonium, the technique can be used to isotopically fingerprint the material to identify potential origins.

Direct determination of Ra-226 in NORM/TENORM matrices by gamma-spectrometry	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							RAY SPECTROMETRY; UNITED-STATES; DECAY SERIES; SOILS; URANIUM	The main shortcoming with the procedure to determine Ra-226 in a gamma spectrum of an environmental sample by means of the Bi-214 and Pb-214 photopeaks is the likelihood of Rn-222 leakage from the sample counting vial. An option to make such determination is to disregard the 226Ra gamma-contributions to the spectrum, other than 186.2 keV (3.5%), subtracting the U-235 contribution to the Ra-226 + U-235 peak at 186 keV. The use of this option to determine directly Ra-226 activity concentrations in environmental samples and in NORM/TENORM matrices will be presented and discussed.

Environmental contamination by technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material - TENORM: A case study of phosphogypsum	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								In the last decades considerable attention has been given to technologically enhanced natural occurring radioactive material (TENORM). Within this frame, of particular concern is the phosphate fertilizer industry, located in Cubatao, Sao Paulo State, Southwest Brazil. This industry is responsible for the production of 69 million tons of phosphogypsum waste, which is stockpiled in the surrounding environment. This waste concentrates radionuclides of the natural series originally present in the phosphate rocks used as raw material. This study aims to evaluate the environmental impact of such activities in the sediments of the estuarine system. Contents of natural radionuclides from thorium and uranium series were measured in sediments from Cubatao estuarine system, using high-resolution gamma-spectrometry. U and Th were determined by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). It was observed that U and Th concentration is higher in the rivers close to the phosphogypsum piles, at least five points were identified as being affected by anthropogenic factors.

Quality assessment of hydrosphere in the vicinity of Czech nuclear power plants by radioanalytical methods	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							SORPTION; TECHNETIUM	The paper deals with the impact of nuclear plants and radioactive waste disposal on surface and ground water quality in their vicinity using various radiometric and radioanalytical methods. The impact of nuclear power plant Temelin on activation concentrations and fission products in hydrosphere, including tritium, was detected. The annual average tritium concentrations in Vltava River correspond to the previously calculated estimates for average and minimal quaranteed flow rates. The concentrations histories of Sr-90 and Cs-137 in surface water show a decreasing trend. This trend was not influenced by the nuclear power plant pilot operation. In the case of tritium, a concentration increase trend has been already observed since the startup of pilot operation. An attempt has made interpreting the sorption and diffusion data for radionuclides of cesium, strontium and tritium and technetium as representatives of multivalent elements. Sorption and diffusion data of Cs-137 and Sr-90 in contact with natural sorbent bentonite lead to the conclusion that both diffusion and batch sorption experiments can be simulated by an exchange model. Sorption of technetium on various bentonites plus additives materials is described. Retention of technetium on these solid phases is driven by sorption of reduced form of technetium Tc(IV).

The research embodied the recovery of uranium with an ion-exchange resin, treatment of effluent resin with lime, or with inorganic adsorbents and biosorbents. The uranium decontamination level using the resin process was 94% and allowed the recovery of this element as a commercial product. Among the inorganic adsorbents studied, phosphogypsum was effective for Ra-226, Ra-228, and Pb-210 removal. Among the biosorbents, Sargassum sp.was superior in relation to its specific capacity to accumulate and remove Ra-226.

Distribution of radionuclides and elements in Cubatao River sediments	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							URANIUM; INDUSTRIAL; BRAZIL; GEOCHEMISTRY; POLLUTION; CHEMISTRY; SERIES; SYSTEM	Cubatao River is located in Santos Basin, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. This region is characterized by the occurrence of estuaries and mangrove. Due to its location, near the coastal line, it is also an important industrial area, where phosphate fertilizer plants, petrol refineries, and chemical and steel industries are present. Such human activities contribute to the enhancement of elemental composition in sediments and, in some cases, also increase the radionuclide concentrations, the so called Technologically Enhanced Natural Occurring Radioactive Materials (TENORM). The contamination of land and sediments by TENORM is of major concern. The activity concentration of U and Th series radionuclides was determined in five sediment samples from Cubatao River. The activity concentration ratio was also determined. Equilibrium was observed for the ratio (234)U/(238)U. The activity ratios of Th/(238)U, (228)Ra/(226)Ra and (210)Pb/(226)Ra were higher than the unity. In the first two cases, the observed values are due to the higher activity of Th in the sediment and in the last case are probably due to the atmospheric deposition of (210)Pb.
