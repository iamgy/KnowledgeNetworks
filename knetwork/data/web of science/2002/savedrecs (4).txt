Therefore a screening test was carried out to find suitable adsorbents for the removal of the radioactive noble gases from the reprocessing off-gas. The adsorption capacities of various adsorbents for Kr and Xe were investigated. Carbon based adsorbents such as Ambersorb 572, Merck, Ryujou-Shirasagi G2x4/6-3 and Molsievon X2M4/6 were found to have large adsorption capacities. The H-mordenite, a non-carbon based adsorbent prepared from natural mordenite by ion exchange with a HCl solution, demonstrated a large adsorption capacity for Kr almost comparable to that of activated charcoal. Since non-carbon based adsorbents have a very important feature, that is they are not susceptible to fire hazards, the adsorption equilibria of Kr and Xe on the H-mordenite adsorbent were more thoroughly studied. The adsorption experiments on the H-mordenite were conducted in the temperature range of 77 K to 353 K using a packed bed column. The adsorption isotherms obtained for the H-mordenite were successfully correlated with the vacancy solution model over wide partial pressure and temperature ranges.

This measurement was repeated systematically over several uranium concentrations from about 195 gU/l to about 430 gU/l. Used core tanks were two cylindrical tanks whose diameters are 600 mm and 800 mm and one slab tank which has 280 mm thickness and 700 mm width. In this report, experimental data such as solution conditions, critical solution level for each solution condition, subcritical solution levels where measurements were conducted, measured decay time constants of prompt neutron and extrapolated beta(eff)/l values are described as well as basic principle of the PNS method. The kinetic parameter beta(eff)/l values were evaluated also by computation with the diffusion code CITATION in SRAC and the nuclear data library JENDL 3.2. Strong linear correlation has been found between kinetic parameter beta(eff)/l and uranium concentration regardless of differences of reflecting conditions or core tank conditions. Experimentally or computationally evaluated beta(eff)/l value is about 90 s(-1) at 195 gU/l and about 170 s(-1) at 430 gU/l and both experimental and computational values show good agreement within an error of 3% which is comparable to about 2% uncertainty of measurement.

For the radioisotope production rates during operation, the Monte Carlo calculation is conducted by the modification of the nuclear data library replacing a prompt gamma-ray spectrum with a decay gamma-ray spectrum. By multiplying each correction factor, which is ratio of the actual activation level after shutdown to the production rate during operation, with each decay gamma-ray flux due to each radioisotope, the decay gamma-ray dose rate is evaluated. In order to improve the statistical error, a variance reduction method is proposed by the application of the weight window importance technique and the specification of the decay gamma-ray generation location. We identify the cell producing the decay gamma-ray which can contribute the decay gamma-ray flux in evaluation locations, and forcibly terminate the gamma-ray transport calculation in the cells except for the identified cells. In order to validate the effectiveness of the method, shielding calculation for actual ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) configuration is performed, and small statistical errors below criteria are obtained. The effectiveness of the proposed method for ITER design analysis is demonstrated.

The property of the Mo precipitate was investigated by using SEM, FTIR, TG-DTA, and XRD. The simulated solution consisted of 1 M nitric acid containing seven elements (Mo, L Ru, Zr, Ce, Nd, Sr) and their radioactive tracers. As a result, the precipitate was composed of the Mo precipitate and re-precipitated alpha-benzoinoxime which was added excessively for increasing the precipitation efficiency. It was confirmed that the Mo precipitate was formed by the reaction of two alpha-benzoinoxime molecules and one MoO22+. Molybdenum precipitate was dissolved in 0.4M NaOH solution within 5 minutes without H2O2. Hydrogen peroxide induced only the rapid dissolution of the alpha-benzoinoxime re-precipitate. Also, the dissolution method without H2O2 was favorable in the purification aspect because Zr and Ru were contained as a small fraction of 1.3% and 7.7%, respectively, in the dissolving solution.

The biodistribution of Tc-99m/99-cysteine complexes was performed in mice. The renal excretion patterns of rats were studied with and without the renal tubular transport inhibitor 2,4-dinitrophenol. The carrier of Tc-cysteine complex in the blood and also the radioactive compounds in the urine were studied by HPGFC and SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. The kidney was confirmed as the target organ; serum albumin functions as a carrier to transport Tc-cysteine complex to the kidney. The protein-bound Tc-cysteine complex was the primary form in excreta, and renal tubular secretion was the foremost excretory pathway.

Radioactive sludge samples were separated to a liquid phase and a wet suspension (solid) phase by centrifuging, and the two phases were treated and analyzed separately, in different ways. A sample preparation procedure based on chemical separation was worked out for the isolation of the alpha-emitting components of radioactive evaporation residues which were saturated with boric acid. To the separate determination of the low activity alpha-emitting isotopes appearing in waste waters to be released into the environment, a microvawe concentration technique was applied. The accuracy of the results obtained using the above chemical separation and alpha-spectrometry was tested in the framework of the international U. S. DOE EML Quality Assessment Program.

The sorbent shows a thermal stability upto 500 degreesC. The diffraction patterns clarify that the sorbent is mainly amorphous in structure. Carbon in these shells was elementally analyzed and the data reveal a predominant content of acidic surface centers with hydrophilic properties. The iscelectric point (pH(pzc)) was determined and found to be 4.2 implying the acidic nature of the sorbent surface. The sorption of Cs+ Co2+ and Eu3+ on the prepared sorbent was studied from aqueous solution under different variables and the sorption capacity had values from 0.23-1.15 meq/g.

The results obtained indicate that although the natural radioactivity of six tap, two drinking, four lake and three well water samples does not exceed the requirements of the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines, however, most of them do exceed those of the Institution of Turkish Standards (ITS). Concentrations ranging from 0.02 to 0.17 Bq.l(-1) and from 0.01 to 0.29 Bq.l(-1) for gross-alpha and gross-beta radioactivity, respectively, were observed in all samples. For most of the samples, there were no regular correspondence between gross-alpha and gross-beta activity concentrations.

The influence of several variables on the gold extraction, including the concentration of gold, the molar ratio of extractants to gold(I), the volume percentage of cosolvent and the pH value of the aqueous phase, was investigated. The results indicated that the radioactive tracer technique is a quick, accurate, and convenient tool to investigate the extraction behavior of an element existing in low concentrations. The experimental results indicated that the studied amines, tetradecyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride, N1923 and tri-n-octylamine, could be used as extractants for the recovery of gold from aqueous alkaline cyanide solutions.

J	Sauer, G				Sauer, G			Computation of fission gas release from UO2 fuel grains by eigenvector transformation	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article								Fission gas release from UO2 fuel is mainly controlled by the diffusion of the gas in the fuel grains. Assuming the fuel grains to be spheres the diffusion process can be described by a partial differential equation in spherical co-ordinates. In this equation the gas concentration depends only on two independent variables: the time t and the radial co-ordinate r. This equation can be solved in closed form for constant gas production and constant diffusion coefficient. For arbitrary varying conditions the equation can only be solved iteratively by special methods. Such a method is presented. It bases on an eigenvector transformation of the modified diffusion equation. By this transformation the gas concentration is expressed by the product of eigenvectors and generalised gas concentrations. The modified diffusion equation is transformed to a series of first order ordinary differential equations that call readily by solved. Tailoring these solutions to irradiation conditions with changing gas production and varying diffusion coefficient an algorithm is obtained that allows to compute the gas release under arbitrary conditions. Through tests it is shown that this algorithm reliably predicts the gas release from fuel grains.

The energy dependence of the corresponding cross section and reaction rate is calculated within the quasi-classical approximation. The reaction rate weakly depends on the collision energy and is of the order of 10(10) s(-1) (normalized to the liquid hydrogen density). Reaction rates are calculated for different isotope compositions of the ion range between 10(9) s(-1) and 10(11) s(-1). A discussion of the results from the point Of view of the Born and eikonal approximation is also presented.

This method, developed for a cylindrical sample geometry, accounts for variable sample heights and provides a fundamental advantage: individual self-absorption corrections can easily be determined knowing the apparent densities of the samples. The results obtained with the proposed method are in good agreement with those given by other techniques. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

CR39 plastic track detectors were used to record neutron-induced recoil tracks. The track density measurements were carried out using a fully automated optical microscope. The experimental results were compared with Monte Carlo simulations using MCNPX-2.1.5 code and an extension code that was written for this purpose. A good agreement was found between the experiment and calculations for normalised results. Applicability of the MCNPX-2.1.5 code for absolute recoil track density determination is discussed.

The sources were prepared by dropping a solution containing Am-241 uniformly. The samples were processed by recoil implantation, using a 72 keV Cu ion beam to knock the Am-241 into the Si substrate. Examination using Rutherford backscattering spectrometry showed that the radioactive nuclide Am-241 was tightly fixed in the Si substrate and the samples could be regarded as sealed alpha sources. In comparison with a commercial Am-241 source, the recoil-implanted sources gave better energy resolution in the alpha spectra; the FWHM is estimated to be 11-13 keV for the 5.4 MeV peak.

J	Murphy, BD; Primm, RT				Murphy, BD; Primm, RT			Simulation of mixed-oxide and low-enriched uranium fuel burnup in a pressurized water reactor and validation against destructive analysis results	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article								dThis work examines the capabilities of simulation codes to predict the concentration of nuclides in spent reactor fuel, in particular mixed-oxide (MOX)-fuel, via comparisons with destructive radiochemical analyses performed on irradiated samples. We report on three MOX samples irradiated in a pressurized water reactor (PWR) and two UO2 samples irradiated in a different PWR. Actinide and fission-product concentrations. were measured and were compared with concentration values obtained from simulation studies. The actinides include isotopes of uranium, neptunium, plutonium,, americium, and curium. The fission products include isotopes of cesium, neodymium, samarium, europium, and gadolinium as well as Sr-90, Mo-95, Tc-99, Ru-101, Ru-106, Rh-103, Ag-109, Sb-125, I-129, and Ce-144. For many of the actinides, the predictions are, quite good when compared with the measured values; but concentrations of some tend to be overpredicted. The cesium and neodymium, and some samarium concentrations, are well predicted, but some of the. other fission products show variable results.

J	Cvetkovic, V; Painter, S; Selroos, JO				Cvetkovic, V; Painter, S; Selroos, JO			Comparative measures of radionuclide containment in the crystalline geosphere	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							HETEROGENEOUS POROUS FORMATIONS; GRANITIC ROCK; FLUID-FLOW; 3-DIMENSIONAL NETWORKS; STOCHASTIC-ANALYSIS; MATRIX DIFFUSION; SOLUTE TRANSPORT; FRACTURED MEDIA; MASS-TRANSPORT; MODEL	A probabilistic model for assessing the capacity of a fractured crystalline rock volume to contain radionuclides is developed The rock volume is viewed as a network of discrete fractures through which radionuclides are transported by flowing water. Diffusive mass transfer between the open fractures and the stagnant water in the pore space of the rock matrix allow radionuclides access to mineral grains where physical and chemical processes-collectively known as sorption-can retain radionuclides. A stochastic Lagrangian framework is adopted to compute the probability that a radionuclide particle will be retained by the rock, i.e., the probability that it will decay before being released from the rock volume. A dimensionless quantity referred to as the "containment index" is related to this probability and proposed as a suitable measure for comparing different rock volumes; such a comparative measure may be needed, for example, in a site selection program for geological radioactive waste disposal. The probabilistic solution of the transport problem is based on the statistics of two Lagrangian variables: T, the travel time of an imaginary tracer moving with the flowing water, and beta, a suitably normalized surface area available for retention. Statistics of tau and beta may be computed numerically using site-specific discrete fracture MP network simulations. Fracture data from the well-characterized Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory site in southern Sweden are used to illustrate the implementation of the proposed containment index for six radionuclides (Sn-126, I-129, Cs-135, Np-237, Pu-239, and Se-79). It is found that fractures of small aperture imply prolonged travel times and hence long tails in both beta and tau. This, in turn, enhances retention and is favorable from a safely assessment perspective.

J	Yamamoto, T; Miyoshi, Y				Yamamoto, T; Miyoshi, Y			Mechanisms of positive temperature reactivity coefficients of dilute plutonium solutions	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article								Mechanisms of a positive temperature reactivity coefficient that occurs in a dilute plutonium solution are investigated based on the perturbation theory and the four-factor formula. The temperature coefficient of a solution fuel is positive if the adjoint flux increases with neutron energy between 0.05 and 0.2 eV As compared to Pu-239, Pu-241 has a tendency to make the temperature coefficient of a plutonium solution positive because of the energy dependence of the capture cross section of Pu-241. As Pu-241 in a plutonium solution decays into Am-241 with time, the temperature coefficient of the solution becomes more Positive. Since the capture cross sections of most neutron absorbers such as boron and gadolinium decrease with increasing neutron energy between 0.05 and 0.2 eV, soluble absorbers in a plutonium solution make the temperature coefficient positive for higher-concentration plutonium solutions. Cadmium and samarium dissolved in a dilute plutonium solution can exceptionally keep the temperature coefficient negative because of the energy dependence of the capture cross sections. A fixed neutron absorber generally makes the temperature coefficient of a plutonium solution negative regardless of the property of absorber materials.

J	Na, MG; Ko, W; Choi, H				Na, MG; Ko, W; Choi, H			A spent-fuel combination method for minimizing composition variability of DUPIC fuel	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							WATER REACTOR-FUEL; CANDU REACTORS; ECONOMIC-ANALYSIS; COST	A combination method of spent pressurized water reactor (PWR)fuel is proposed that adjusts the fuel composition for direct use of spent PWR fuel in Canada deuterium. uranium (CANDU) reactors (DUPIC). This method reduces the composition heterogeneity (variation) of the DUPIC fuel caused by directly reusing spent PWR fuel as DUPIC fuel feedstock. In this study, a combination method was used to find the optimum mixture composition from the spent PWR fuel database by minimizing the composition variation of the major fissile isotopes U-235 and Pu-239. The simulation results have shown that the combination method can reduce the composition variation of U-235 and Pu-239 to 0.11 and 1.40%, respectively, through assemblywise mixing operation only. It is also believed that the result could be improved further through a rodwise combination technique if the isotopic composition of each spent PWR fuel rod is known by direct measurement during the DUPIC fuel fabrication process.

Different variables affecting the distribution coefficient, the retention and hence separation efficiency such as eluent flow rate and concentrations of HCl and ammonium sulfate (NH4)(2)SO4 containing the mobile phase were studied. The developed separation protocol of U, Th and REEs was optimized using an Ion Pac CS5 separation column followed by post-column derivatization reaction with Arsenaso III and UV-VIS spectrophotometeric detection. Comparative evaluation of U, Th and REEs concentration in monazite mineral was demonstrated using two different on-line detection modes including flow through cell scintillation detector (FSD) and UV-VIS spectrophotometer. Response of the FSD was found to be linear over the full range of activities investigated (4-100 Bq). The lower limits of detection (LLD) for the investigated radionuclides were 3.0+/-0.1 Bq for U-238 and 6.0+/-0.1 Bq for 232 Th. The detection of 211 U and 232 Th by FSD shows good agreement with the corresponding determination by UV-VIS spectrophotometer. The content of ThO2 and U3O8 in monazite sample were found to be 4.7+/-0.1% and 0.42+/-0.04% using,UV-VIS detector and 4.3+/-0.1% and 0.45+/-0.1% using FSD, respectively.

J	Navas, A; Soto, J; Machin, J				Navas, A; Soto, J; Machin, J			U-238, Ra-226, Pb-210, Th-232 and K-40 activities in soil profiles of the Flysch sector (Central Spanish Pyrenees)	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						natural radionuclides; profile distribution; edaphogenesis; tertiary continental Flysch; Central Spanish Pyrenees	NATURAL RADIONUCLIDES; URANIUM; RADIOACTIVITY; SASKATCHEWAN; ISOTOPES	Distributions of natural gamma-emitting radionuclides were determined in three soil profiles developed on Tertiary sedimentary materials in mountain landscapes of the Central Spanish Pyrenees. Radioisotope activities (Bq kg(-1)) lie in the range of 0-53 for U-238; 19-33 for Ra-226; 7-75 for Pb-210; 24-48 for Th-232 and 335-562 for K-40. U-238 and Pb-210 activities show an important variability down the soil profiles. 238U was markedly depleted in all upper soil layers and highly enriched in lower layers of two soil profiles. 210Pb exhibits very dissimilar distribution patterns in all three soils. 226Ra and 232Th had quite uniform depth distributions. 40K showed depletion in both upper and lower layers in one soil profile but remained fairly constant in the other two profiles. U-238/Ra-226 activity ratios (ARs) have been used to assess equilibrium in the 238 U decay chain and as indicators of edaphogenesis in the studied soil profiles. Maintenance of initial proportionality in the ratio of Th-232/U-238 activities has been assessed through ARs of their progenies. Additionally, a variety of soil properties were measured down the soil profiles. Among soils, variation in radionuclide activies may be due to differences in carbonate content, organic matter and/or grain size. In this environment, soil properties differently affect mobilization of natural radionuclides. The association of some radiologic properties with soil layers suggest a relationship between soil processes and radionuclide distribution. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The sources of continuous replenishment for the transmuters Were Np, Am, and Cm extracted after a 3-yr holding period from the VVER and Superphoenix spent fuel. It is shown that the most effective transmuter is a subcritical liquid fuel ELYaU system with an average thermal-neutron flux in the blanket 2(.)10(15) sec(-1).cm(-2). For solid fuel reactors, the continuous-irradiation model makes it possible to describe approximately the multiple transmutation regime. In the foreseeable future, one-time transmutation of Np, Am, and Cm in a solid fuel reactor followed by storage in along-term storage facility is feasible. The results of different computational variants for such regimes show that for transmutation in 10 yr in PHWR the radiotoxicity of Np, Am, and Cm accumulated in long-term storage reaches an equilibrium in no longer than 100 yr.

The calibration procedure consists in performing measurements using the SKAT laboratory test stand at the Radium Institute with a model unirradiated assembly and neutron sources with known intensity, simulating neutron emission, comparing experimental data and calculations for certain reference points. The data obtained from destructive analysis can be used to establish a relation between the neutron flux of an irradiated assembly and the parameters being determined (fuel burnup, content of the main fissioning isotopes). A relation is presented between burnup and accumulation of the main neutron-emitting isotopes in spent RBMK, fuel. The data were obtained by radiochemical and alpha- and mass-spectrometric methods. The total neutron emission is determined taking account of the neutron yield from spontaneous-fission reactions of even isotopes of plutonium and curium and from (alpha, n) reactions.

J	Froschauer, K; Simon, G				Froschauer, K; Simon, G			Radiological monitoring systems and their specific application in nuclear facilities	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								Radiological monitoring installations are needed, and are most useful, in all parts of the nuclear fuel cycle, in radioactive waste management, and in decommissioning nuclear plants. Plant-specific systems are used especially to characterize and identify radioactive substances and waste, and in the operation of waste treatment centers. Greater efficiency is achieved by using this equipment for specific plant-dependent measurements on which decisions are based. Points in case are the higher tluoughputs attainable in waste treatment plants by supporting data management by an additional plant-specific data tracking system. For this purpose, RWE NUKEM GmbH developed a comprehensive range of monitoring systems over the past few years. They can be modified as a function of requirements and can be tailored to specific applications. These systems mainly include facilities for identifying fissile material and determining the burnup of spent fuel, systems for waste classification and waste separation, and for characterizing radioactive waste or conducting clearance measurements of potentially radioactive waste. The measuring techniques employed in these systems have been known and proven for a long time. They are the basis also of present monitoring systems. However, specific requirements and the need for optimized plant-specific designs have led to advanced measuring techniques. Especially the skillful combination of measurement systems and the use of fast PCs have produced powerful monitoring systems for a variety of routine applications.

Observance of the emplacement conditions was demonstrated by product inspection measures. In accordance with the terms of emplacement, only waste was accepted for emplacement which had passed product inspection without any complaints. The experience accumulated with suppliers of waste and in emplacement campaigns was evaluated. Both the technical and administrative principles of product inspection, the conditioning techniques and methods of determining activity employed as well as the approach used to document the data required for final storage and the execution of accompanying inspections were considered and evaluated. The product inspection approach has proved to work successfully in major and minor homogeneous and heterogeneous waste campaigns. Consequently, this proven and established method of product inspection should remain unchanged and continue to be applied in conditioning, characterizing, and documenting waste, waste forms, and waste packages.

High-volume aerosol sampling was conducted at three sites: (1) On Site, (2) Near Field, and (3) Cactus Flats. Pu-239,Pu-240 was determined by alpha spectrometry following chemical separations; mass loadings were determined gravimetrically. A separate set of low-volume aerosol samples was analyzed for major ions using ion chromatography and for trace elements by inductively-coupled plasma emission spectrometry and mass spectrometry. The average Pu-239,Pu-240 activity concentrations in total suspended particle (TSP) samples (12 to 16 nBq m(-3)) were consistent with those previously reported, but they varied strongly with season, with the highest values generally in spring. Further, the Pu-239,Pu-240 activity concentrations were comparable among the three sites, and therefore there was no evidence for elevated Pu-239,Pu-240 activities due to WIPP operations. The fraction of the Pu-239,Pu-240 activity concentrations in the PM10 samples (particles less than 10 mum diameter) relative to TSP was lower than the corresponding PM10/TSP ratios of either high-volume mass or several inorganics (sulfate, aluminum or lead), indicating that Pu-239,Pu-240 tends to be on large particles. Aerosol mass loadings (mug m(-3)) and Pu-239,Pu-240 activity concentrations were correlated for all sets of samples, but at On Site, the TSP samples showed higher mass to Pu-239,Pu-240 ratios than the other sites. Thus activities or processes occurring at or near the WIPP site evidently produced aerosols that contributed to the mass loadings but contained less Pu-239,Pu-240 than ambient aerosols. About 63% of the variability in Pu-239,Pu-240 activity concentrations was explained by wind travel, sampling location, length of the sampling interval, and aerosol mass. Pu-239,Pu-240 activity concentrations also were correlated with aluminum (an indicator of mineral dust), further implicating the resuspension of soils as an important determinant of Pu-239,Pu-240 in aerosols. The Pu-239,Pu-240/Al ratios for the aerosols were higher than in soils, and this could be explained by the preferential binding of Pu-239,Pu-240 to small soil particles that have large surface area to mass ratios and also have higher aluminum contents than larger particles.

J	Semkow, TM				Semkow, TM			Experimental verification of overdispersion in radioassay data	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						counting efficiency; beta particles; alpha particles; statistics	COUNTING STATISTICS; VARIANCE; NUCLEAR	New evidence is provided suggesting that radioassay data are frequently overdispersed with respect to the Poisson distribution. Twelve cases of radioassay data were measured using commonly available detection systems. The data were analyzed using a limited version of the overdispersion model developed earlier. In that limit, the relationships between three overdispersed distributions were derived and discussed: beta-Poisson, negative binomial, and overdispersed Gaussian. Out of a total of 13 cases studied (12 measured plus one from the literature), 4 were consistent with the Poisson statistics at 90% confidence level while the remaining 9 were found overdispersed. This shows that the overdispersion is rather prevalent in radioassay. All three overdispersed distributions fitted the data very well. The overdispersion was attributed mostly to the excess fluctuations of the detection systems or, in 2 cases, sequential radioactive decay.

J	Steinman, RL; Weiner, RF; Kearfott, KJ				Steinman, RL; Weiner, RF; Kearfott, KJ			A comparison of transient dose model predictions and experimental measurements	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						computer calculations; risk analysis; dose assessment; transportation		The RADTRAN and RISKIND transportation risk analysis computer codes are the primary tools used to estimate dose consequences and risks associated with the transport of radioactive material. Over the years, some of the mathematical models used within the two computer codes have been updated and the methodologies to calculate input parameters have been improved. In addition, both codes have been evaluated for ease of use and appropriateness of application and verified against other computer codes that perform similar calculations. However, neither code has been validated against experimental data. This report discusses the results of five sets of experimental measurements used to partially validate the specific mathematical models used to predict the dose to an individual due to a passing shipment of radioactive material within the RADTRAN and RISKIND computer codes. Based on the comparisons it was found that RISKIND most closely predicted the measured dose in the majority of the investigated scenarios and that 12 out of 14 cases demonstrate the expected inverse relationship between the measured dose and the distance of closest approach. Only half of the data demonstrated the expected inverse relationship between dose and speed of travel.

This paper has also shown that a scanning detector counting system can be satisfactorily simulated by putting the detector in different places relative to the phantom and averaging the results. This technique was verified by experimental work that obtained an agreement of 96% between scanning and averaging. The BOMAB phantom family in use at the Human Monitoring Laboratory was also modeled so that both counting efficiency and size correction factors could be estimated. It was found that the size correction factors lie in the region of 2.4 to 0.66 depending on phantom size and photon energy. The efficiency results from the MCNP scanning simulations were 97% of the measured scanning efficiency. A single function that fits counting efficiency, size, and photon energy was also developed. The function gives predicted efficiencies that are in the range of +10% to -8% of the true value.

J	Uyttenhove, J; Lemmens, M; Zizi, M				Uyttenhove, J; Lemmens, M; Zizi, M			Depleted uranium in Kosovo: Results of a survey by gamma spectrometry on soil samples	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						uranium, depleted; soil; spectrometry, gamma; contamination, environmental		The presence of depleted uranium in the soil of former Yugoslavia after the 1999 conflict raised great public concern all over the world. The so-called Balkan-syndrome is. often linked with depleted uranium contamination. An excellent compilation of data about DU and its possible impact on health and environment can be found in the 1999 UNEP report and publications from the Swedish Radiation Protection Institute. Unfortunately, very few systematic and reliable data on the possible depleted uranium concentrations were until now available. Some of these rare data are only available on the web, without adequate information about the experimental procedure used. To clarify the situation, a systematic survey was started in the summer of 2000 as a collaborative effort between Ghent University (Physics Laboratory) and the Belgian Ministry of Defense (Medical Service). From 50 sites selected all over Kosovo, 150 soil samples were measured in the laboratory with a high-resolution gamma-spectrometer. Some sites (14) were explicitly selected based on military information on the use of depleted uranium munitions in the vicinity. After careful analysis we can conclude that there is no indication of any depleted uranium contamination on these 50 sites with a minimal detectable activity of 15 Bq; this corresponds approximately to 1 mg depleted uranium in a typical sample (100-150 g).

The particulate detection system consists of a moving filter paper assembly, a plastic scintillation detector, and a rate meter output, and is part of a comprehensive stack monitoring system. A predicted response was derived for the case of a steady-state activity distribution across the surface of the moving filter paper that is in proximity to the detector and was determined to be 1.59 x 10(7) cpm per unit airborne concentration of Cs-138 (expressed in units of Bq cm(-3)), where Cs-138 was used as an indicator for a hypothetical fission product release. The corresponding response model provided by the manufacturer was found to underestimate airborne activity concentrations by about an order of magnitude. A predicted response also was derived for the case of a rapid change in airborne activity concentration, which was formulated based on the kinetics of the rate meter circuit and was used to establish alarm settings and detection limits for the particulate detection system.

To guarantee image quality a constant monitoring of the scanner integrity is essential. On present PET scanners, the built-in transmission sources are being used for the measurement of a uniform blank scan and the computation of detector-block efficiencies. These efficiencies can be compared to reference data and deviations indicate changes of the scanner condition. On the high-resolution research tomograph (ECAT HRRT) the design of the transmission source makes this method impractical. For that reason we investigated the use of the natural background radioactivity from the new scintillator material LSO as a uniform source. A procedure was developed to measure detector-block sensitivities and energy spectra directly. An initial quality check (QC) scan is the basis for comparison of daily scans, so that gain shifts of photomultipliers and specific hardware defects can be detected. With an improved list mode based data acquisition it was possible to reduce the acquisition time to around 3 h despite the low LSO count rate, so that this routine is as practical as previous procedures in clinical routine.

Coarse septa result in higher sensitivity than found with the two-dimensional mode with conventional full septa and lower scatter fraction than the three-dimensional mode without septa. We propose a new scatter correction method using coarse septa, where scatter components are estimated from coincidence data for those line-of-respouses that are intercepted by the coarse septa. This scatter correction potentially has the ability to cope with scatter from radioactivity outside the field of view. In addition, we show the feasibility of a lead tungstate (PWO) PET scanner with coarse septa.

In this paper, we describe the system assembled with a Si detector, 300-mum thick, segmented into 64 x 64 square pixels with 170-mum pitch. The solid-state pixel array detector is bump-bonded pixel by pixel to a low threshold, single particle counting electronics, the photon counting chip (PCC) developed by the Medipix1 Collaboration for biomedical applications. Each cell (corresponding to a detector pixel) of the front-end chip has a maximum count rate of 2 MHz, a minimum nominal threshold of 1400 e(-) (corresponding about 5 keV in Si), and contains a 15-bit counter. The detector sensitive area is about 1 cm(2), but several detectors could be assembled in arrays. The measured background counts were about 3.5 x 10(-2) cps/cm(2), which implies a very high sensitivity of the device. The detection threshold used in this experiment was similar to15 keV. In this paper, we show the results obtained in the real-time monitoring of two biological dynamic processes: an amino acid uptake by living cells and the thermal denaturation process of oligonucleotides. Specifically, we have followed over time the accumulation of a marked amino acid ([C-14]L-Leucine) into Octopus vulgaris eggs cells. The results, described in Section III-B, show that after about 20 min from the beginning of the uptake process, the radioactively marked eggs become clearly visible over the background culture radioactive medium. In Sections III-C and III-D, we also describe the successful performance of the beta-imaging system in genetic studies involving the real time reconstruction of denaturation and kinetics curves for two different P-32-radiolabeled nucleotides.

The first type is a monolithic one-dimensional (1-D) detector with segmented n-type strips formed on the p-like CdTe crystal wafer. N-type strips were formed by diffusing indium using an excimer laser annealing process. In another approach, single element diode-type detectors were fabricated by growing an iodine-doped epitaxial layer on the p-like CdTe crystal in a metalorganic chemical vapor deposition system working at a low substrate temperature. A 1-D linear array detector was then developed by mounting a number of such small element detectors in a row. Both types of detectors exhibited good diode-like property with suppressed leakage currents in the reverse bias direction, which enabled us to apply a high electric field on the detectors in order to improve their performance. Nuclear detection tests performed at room temperature using Co-57 and Am-241 radioisotopes showed improved and uniform spectral responses from both types of detectors. Details about the detector fabrication and the spectral results that demonstrate the imaging and spectroscopy capabilities of these detectors are presented.

The model allows the amount, spatial, and temporal distribution of true, scattered, and random coincidences to be estimated independently for any radioactive source (both phantoms and real patients), taking proper account of system dead time. The model was applied to a 3-D NaI(Tl) current-generation PET scanner for which there are no currently available methods for estimating scatter and random components in whole-body studies. The quantitative accuracy of the developed noise model was tested by comparing simulated and measured PET data in terms of physical parameters, count-rate curves, and spatial distribution profiles. Scatter and random components were assessed for phantoms representing brain, abdomen, and whole-body studies. Evidence was found of high scatter an random contribution in 3-D PET clinical studies. The clinical response of the PET system, in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, was assessed and optimized, confirming the suitability of the default energy window, although suggesting a possible improvement by setting a lower energy threshold higher than the current default.

The detector has a planar and a coaxial segments, 68 nun in diameter and., respectively, 20 and 50 mm in length. The energy resolution of the planar segment was 1.3 keV on the energy of 122 keV and of the coaxial segment-2.5 keV on the energy of 1.33 MeV. The relative efficiency of the whole crystal was 60% at the energy of 1.33 MeV. The background suppression system has independent channels for amplifying and shaping the spectrometric pulses at the planar, coaxial and common outputs of the segmented detector. The planar and coaxial channels have a nonswitchable shaping time constant of 2 mus and the common channel-a switchable shaping time constant of 2 mus or 4 mus. The background suppression system is PC-controlled by the special software. Testing of the spectrometer with isotopes Cs-137 and Cs-137 + Co-57 has shown that the relative improvement in peak-Compton ratio for registration with and without suppression is 1.4 for the energy of 662 keV and exceeds 1.5 for the energy of 136 keV.

J	Evans, WC				Evans, WC			Concentration dynamics modeling for continuous particulate air monitor response prediction	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						compartmental modeling; continuous particulate airborne radioactivity monitoring; decay chains; linear systems; mathematical modeling; power reactor radiation monitoring		A linear-systems matrix-based mathematical formulation for predicting continuous particulate air monitor (CPAM) responses when monitoring a system of compartments served by an HVAC system is developed. The CPAM responses, for both fixed- and moving-filter monitors, are found using a "quasi-numerical" approach, combining numerical eigenvector/eigenvalues with closed-form analytical solutions, for sources with exponential time-dependence. This formulation is general and can handle complex or simple systems with no changes to the mathematics. Parent-progeny decay chain) nuclides, with branching, are handled directly. The monitor responses are found via several alternative methods. The computations are readily mechanized, providing a valuable analytical tool for the efficient analysis of many CPAM applications. Two example cases are presented: 1) a multicompartment, multisource system, for a single nuclide; 2) a two-compartment, Kr-88-Rb-88 decay chain system, as found in an actual PWR containment building.
