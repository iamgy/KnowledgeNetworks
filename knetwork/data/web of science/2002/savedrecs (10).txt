J	Xu, ZW; Driscoll, MJ; Kazimi, MS				Xu, ZW; Driscoll, MJ; Kazimi, MS			Neutron spectrum effects on burnup, reactivity and isotopics in UO2/H2O lattices	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article								To provide guidance for future light water reactor core design and fuel management strategies, the effects of the moderator-to-fuel ratio on burnup, core endurance, and waste disposal characteristics have been investigated. The analysis is based on a unit cell model of the standard four-loop Westing house pressurized water reactor (PWR) with varied water density, rod diameter, and lattice pitch. Two state-of-the-art computer codes, CASMO-4 and MOCUP (MCNP + ORIGEN), have been used. Considering the entire range of moderation (from fast spectra to overthermalized spectra), the results show that higher reactivity-limited burnup is achievable by either a wetter lattice or a much drier lattice than normal. In particular, epithermal lattices are distinctly inferior performers. Current PWR lattices are about the optimum in terms of highest fuel endurance. However, wetter lattices produce less plutonium with a degraded plutonium isotopic mix with respect to weapons usability. Neptunium-237 content is only mildly affected by the hydrogen-to-heavy-metal ratio. High burnup is significantly beneficial to reducing plutonium production per unit energy and to making its isotopic mix less attractive as a weapon material. In particular, the Pu-238 to Pu-239 ratio increases approximately as the 2.5 power of burnup for a fixed initial enrichment. Based on this neutronics study, wetter lattices are recommended for future high-burnup applications.

For concepts in which shutdown rods are situated outside the core region, as is the case in contemporary modular pebble bed designs, accurate calculations are needed,for the worth of these shutdown rods not only in normal operation but also under accident conditions ill which significant changes occur, for instance, due to inadvertant moderation increase in the core (ingress of water or other hydrogeneous compound). Corresponding validation experiments, employing a variety of reactivity measurement techniques, were conducted in the framework of the HTR-PROTEUS program employing low-enriched uranium pebble-type fuel. Details of the experimental configurations, along with the measurement results obtained, are given for two different HTR-PROTEUS cores', in each Of Which four different shutdown rod combinations were investigated. Comparisons made with calculations, based on both approximative deterministic models and geometrically "near-to-exact" Monte Carlo analyses, have clearly brought out the sensitivity of the experimental results to calculational correction factors when conventional (thermal) techniques are used for reactivity measurements in such systems. Considerably greater systematic accuracies are reflected in the experimental shutdown rod values obtained using specially developed epithermal techniques, and it is these results that are recommended for benchmarking purposes.

Effective multiplication-factors for fresh fuel assemblies on the railroad platform, fresh fuel assemblies in the within-plant fuel transportation vehicle, and fresh fuel assemblies in the spentfuel storage pool are calculated. If there is no absorber between the units, the configurations with all MOX assemblies result in higher effective multiplication factors than the configurations with all LEU assemblies when the system is dry. When the systems are flooded, the configurations with all LEU assemblies result in higher effective multiplication factors. For normal operating conditions, effective multiplication factors for all configurations are below the presumed upper subcritical limit of 0.95. For an accident condition of a fully loaded within-plant fuel transportation vehicle that is "flooded" with low-density water (possibly from a fire suppression system), the presumed upper subcritical limit is exceeded by configurations containing either LEU or a combination of LEU and MOX assemblies.

Although the resolution of the alpha spectra is poorer than that attained with semiconductor detectors, it is still an attractive alternative. We describe here attempts to fit a peak shape to experimental liquid-scintillation alpha spectra and discuss the parameters affecting this shape, such as the PSA (pulse-shape analyser) level, vial type, shaking the sample, etc. Spectral analysis has been applied for complex alpha spectra.

In this paper we describe the first large solid-angle polarisation analysis measurement using a He-3 neutron spin filter at thermal neutron wavelengths (lambda = 2.5 Angstrom). This experiment was performed on the two-axis diffractometer D1B at the Institut Laue-Langevin using a banana-shaped filter cell (530 cm(3)) filled with He-3 gas with a polarisation of P = 52% at a pressure of 2.7 bar. A comparison is made with a previous measurement on D7 using a cold neutron beam on the same sample, i.e. amorphous ErY6Ni3. Using uniaxial polarisation analysis both the nuclear and magnetic crosssections could be extracted over the range of scattering-vectors [0.5 less than or equal to Q(Angstrom(-1)) less than or equal to3.5]. The results are in qualitative and quantitative agreement with the D7-data, where supermirrors were used to analyse the spin of the scattered neutrons. The paper analyses the essential parameters governing this technique and describes its experimental realisation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Abhold, ME; Baker, MC				Abhold, ME; Baker, MC			MCNP-REN: a Monte Carlo tool for neutron detector design	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						nondestructive assay; Monte Carlo; MCNP; neutron detection	DSP	The development of neutron detectors makes extensive use of the predictions of detector response through the use of Monte Carlo techniques in conjunction with the point reactor model. Unfortunately, the point reactor model fails to accurately predict detector response in common applications. For this reason, the general Monte Carlo code developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP), was modified to simulate the pulse streams that would be generated by a neutron detector and normally analyzed by a shift register. This modified code, MCNP-Random Exponentially Distributed Neutron Source (MCNP-REN), along with the Time Analysis Program. predicts neutron detector response without using the point reactor model, making it unnecessary for the user to decide whether or not the assumptions of the point model are met for their application. MCNP-REN is capable of simulating standard neutron coincidence counting Lis well as neutron multiplicity counting. Measurements of mixed oxide fresh fuel were taken with the Underwater Coincidence Counter, and measurements of highly enriched uranium reactor fuel were taken with the active neutron interrogation Research Reactor Fuel Counter and compared to calculation. Simulations completed for other detector design applications are described. The method used in MCNP-REN is demonstrated to be fundamentally sound and shown to eliminate the need to use the point model for detector performance predictions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Galy, J; Magill, J; Van Dam, H; Valko, J				Galy, J; Magill, J; Van Dam, H; Valko, J			A neutron booster for spallation sources - application to accelerator driven systems and isotope production	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						accelerator driven system; spallation source; isotope production; neutron booster; thin layers	AM-242M; FUEL	One can design a critical system with fissile material in the form of a thin layer on the inner surface of a cylindrical neutron moderator such as graphite or beryllium. Recently, we have investigated the properties of critical and near critical systems based on the use of thin actinide layers of uranium, plutonium and americium. The thickness of the required fissile layer depends on the type of fissile material, its concentration in the layer and on the geometrical arrangement, but is typically in the pm-mm range. The resulting total mass of fissile material can be as low as 100g. Thin fissile layers have a variety of applications in nuclear technology-for example in the design neutron amplifiers for medical applications and "fast" islands in thermal reactors for waste incineration. In the present paper, we investigate the properties of a neutron booster unit for spallation sources and isotope production. In those applications a layer of fissile material surrounds the spallation source. Such a module could be developed for spallation targets foreseen in the MYRRHA (L. Van Den Durpel, H. Aft Abderrahim, P. D'hondt, G. Minsart, J.L. Bellefontaine, S. Bodart, B. Ponsard, F. Vermeersch, W. Wacquier. A prototype accelerator driven system in Belgium: the Myrrha project, Technical Committee Meeting on Feasibility and Motivation for Hybrid concepts for Nuclear Energy generation and Transmutation, Madrid, Spain, September 17-19, 1997 [1]). or MEGAPIE (M. Salvatores, G.S. Bauer, G. Heusener. The MEGAPIE initiative: executive outline and status as per November 1999, MPO-1-GB-6/0-GB, 1999 [2]) projects. With a neutron multiplication factor of the booster unit in the range 10-20 (i.e. with a k(eff) of 0.9-0.95), considerably less powerful accelerators would be required to obtain the desired neutron flux. Instead of the powerful accelerators with proton energies of 1 GeV and currents of 10 mA foreseen for accelerator driven systems, similar neutron fluxes can be obtained with a medical cyclotron with proton energies of 350 MeV and currents of 2 mA. A basic limitation of such booster units is of course the limited lifetime of the thin fissile layer due to burn up and fission product poisoning. Nevertheless, for initial investigations of full power ADS systems, such units would allow the generation of the full neutron flux without the use of ADS class accelerators. The properties of the neutron booster have been intensively studied through systematic investigations of the different parameters (thickness, Hohlraum, reflector, etc.) of the concept. The calculations were performed with deterministic codes solving the neutron transport equation, and those results have been partially verified with the probabilistic code MCNP (Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport Code System). Layer of pure U-235 and Am-242m fuel have been initially investigated, but non-proliferation concerns led to the use of more conventional fuel layer. A specific geometry of a booster spallation source is presented. The effects of layer-burn up and lifetime are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Alpha and beta activities were determined using a liquid-scintillation detector with pulse-shape analysis feature. All the purified water had values of beta activity lower than the limit for potable drinking water (1.0 Bq/1), while three brands surpassed the limit of alpha activity (0.1 Bq/1). The limit for alpha radioactivity content was exceed by three mineral waters; the results show a correlation between radioactivity content and mineral salts, which are related with the origin and treatment of the waters.

It was found that 1 : 1 complexes were predominately formed in weakly acidic conditions. The total exchangeable proton capacities and the degrees of dissociation of these humic substances were determined by using a potentiometric titration method. The key parameters necessary for the experimental determination of the conditional stability constants of metal ions with humic substances in weakly acidic conditions by using the cation exchange method were discussed. The conditional stability constants of 1 : 1 complexes obtained in this paper were compared with the literature data of Am(III) determined by using the ion exchange method and the solvent extraction method and with the stability constants of 1 : 1 complexes of UO22+ and Th4+ with the same soil humic substances. These results indicate the great stability of bivalent UO22+, trivalent Eu3+. Am3+ and tetravalent Th complexes with humic and fuhic acids in weakly acidic conditions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Dong, WM; Li, WJ; Tao, ZY				Dong, WM; Li, WJ; Tao, ZY			Use of the ion exchange method for the determination of stability constants of trivalent metal complexes with humic and fulvic acids II. Tb3+Yb3+ and Gd3+ complexes in weakly alkaline conditions	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Tb(III); Yb(III); Gd(III); humic acid; fulvic acid; complexation; stability constants; anion exchange	NUCLEAR-MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; EUROPIUM BINDING; URANYL IONS	The conditional stability constants for tracer concentrations of Tb(III), Yb(III), and Gd(III) with three soil humic acids, three soil fulvic acids and a fulvic acid from weathered coal were determined at pH 9.0-9.1 (these values are similar to those in calcareous soils) in the presence of NaHCO3 by using the anion exchange method. It A as found that 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 complexes were simultaneously formed in the weakly alkaline conditions. The conditional stability constants of these 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 complexes were calculated from the distribution coefficients of rare earth elements at various concentrations of humate or fulvate. The stability constants indicate the very high stability of trivalent Tb 3 1, Yb3+ and Gd3+ complexes with humic substances in weakly alkaline conditions. The key parameters necessary for the experimental determination of the conditional stability constants of metal ions with humic substances in the presence of NaHCO3 by using an anion exchange method were discussed, The conditional stability constants of these 1 : 1 and 1 :2 complexes were compared in this paper. It was found that stabilities of Tb3+ 1 : 1 and 1 :2 complexes with humic acid are greater than the corresponding ones with fulvic acid from the same soil. In addition, the effect of the presence of Ca2+ as a competitor on the stabilities of 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 complexes of Yb was examined and no pronounced change of stabilities of 1 : 1 complex was found, even though Ca2+ is in a 10(3) excess to Yb3+.

The validity of the SSNTD technique utilized was checked by analysing uranyl nitrate (UO2(NO3)(2)6H(2)O) standard solutions. A relationship between water radon concentration and water transmission of different water sources belonging to two regions of the Middle Atlas (Morocco) water reservoir was found. The influence of the water flow rate as well as the permeability and fracture system of the host rocks of the sources studied was investigated. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Saad, HR; Al-Azmi, D				Saad, HR; Al-Azmi, D			Radioactivity concentrations in sediments and their correlation to the coastal structure in Kuwait	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article							1991 GULF-WAR; NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; RADIONUCLIDES; SOILS	Gamma-ray spectrometric measurements were performed on sediment samples from the coast of Kuwait to study the concentration of natural as well as man-made radioactive sources. The coast of Kuwait, which extends for some 170 kin is mainly soft sedimentary colitic limestones or sandstones, overlaid in many areas with beach or wind-blown sand. In the north, suspended material from the Shatt Al-Arab delta has settled to form extensive soft areas of intertidal mud within Kuwait Bay. Forty samples were taken at different points along the coast in undisturbed areas at intervals of about 5 km. Collection was carried out during low-tide. where it was possible to collect sediments from the wet region that was covered by seawater during the high tide. At each of the sample sites, a sampling area of about 1 m(2) was considered. Samples collected from the north were of a muddy nature, whereas the southern samples were sandy. All samples were left to dry in open air before drying in the oven at 105degreesC for 2-3 days to remove all water content. The radioactivity in southern areas reaches about one half of the values commonly assigned as the world average. In the northern areas, higher radioactivity concentrations are found but are still below the international levels. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The possibility of using this sorbent for selective removal of Cs-137 and Co-60 for large volumes of sea water and producing fast methods of analysis is examined. Information is presented on the content of technogenic radionuclides in sea water in regions of disposal of radioactive wastes in the Sea of Japan and in the region of the accident on a nuclear powered submarine. It is shown that the disposal of radioactive wastes in the Sea of Japan did not change the background radioecological conditions. The radioactivity of sea water at the epicenter of the accident in Bukhta Chazhma is a consequence of the accident and is due to Co-60; the presence of Cs-137 and Sr-90 is due to global fallout. The concentration of technogenic radionuclides in water and hydrobionts does not exceed admissable norms.

No final concrete solution has been found so far. In the past few years, problems of transport safety, reprocessing, and interim storage were in the foreground of interest. An issue important for the future is final storage. Consequently, a number of statements are put up below for discussion about the further approach to be taken. - There is no repository for high-level radioactive waste from NPP's anywhere in the world. - The yardsticks for evaluating safe final storage applied in Germany up until 1998 no longer correspond to the state of the art. - Interim storage provides the time horizon necessary for the final site selection procedure. - A new site must be found for a repository. - Final storage is a national responsibility. - International yardsticks must be taken into account in final storage. - On-site interim storage and direct disposal minimize transports. - The definition of residual periods of operation of nuclear power plants limits the waste volume to be managed, and also takes some of the potential for conflicts out of the decision in favor of a specific repository site. - The existing financial regulations requiring reserves to be accumulated for final storage aggravate the construction and operation of a repository and must be replaced by a fund. - The objective must be to have a repository available by 2030. In this societal and technical environment, the development of a repository must be advanced speedily with broad scientific backing of site selection and in a transparent procedure.

In PWRs, high local power densities are a prerequisite for achieving a high batch burnup. The range of maximum power densities that can be exploited for in-core fuel management and operational flexibility is restricted by the Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCOs) obtained from analyses of anticipated operational occurrences and hypothetical accidents. Since utilities mainly use available margins for implementing advanced in-core fuel management strategies or for power uprating, a suitable parameter for making a rough comparison of the present thermal-hydraulic design status of different PWRs is the maximum local heat flux achieved during actual cycles under steady-state fall-power conditions. The main reasons why higher power densities are permissible can usually be attributed to different core surveillance concepts in conjunction with different control assembly management schemes. Moreover two representative studies conducted with a new methodology using the three-dimensional. neutronics/thermal hydraulics coupled code PANBOX for core transient analysis present additional margins. The additional DNBR margin gained in the representative studies was 0.38. However, utilization of this additional margin is accompanied by larger void fractions within the upper section of the hot channel during normal operation. Therefore, increasing steady-state maximum power densities has to be done gradually while collecting and evaluating operating experience each time. Although the concept presented herein is specifically tailored to Siemens PWRs, it is obvious that the application of a three-dimensional neutronics/thermal hydraulics coupled code could also provide significant benefits for non-Siemens PWRs as well.

J	Taylor, LS				Taylor, LS			History of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) (Reprinted from Health Phys., vol 1, pg 97-104, 1958)	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Reprint								The ICRP was established by the second International Congress of Radiology in 1928. Since this time the Commission has established the basic pattern for radiation protection recommendations that have gone into use throughout the world. The first quantitative value of permissible dose was promulgated in 1934 and remained in effect until 1950. In 1950 the MPD was lowered by a factor of about 2, and in 1956 it was again lowered by a factor of about 3. In addition to the development of the basic concept of MPD, the Commission has also adopted maximum permissible concentrations of radioactive materials in air and water and the whole body. The discussion below outlines the various steps that have? taken place in the development of radiation concepts since the establishment of the Commission just 30 years ago.								*NBS, 1929, 374 NBS; ROBERT PO, 1956, CR HEBD ACAD SCI, V242, P3134; TAYLOR L S, 1958, Health Phys, V1, P97, DOI 10.1097/00004032-195804000-00001; 1951, NATL BUREAU STANDARD, V47; 1928, PROPOSALS BRIT XRAY; 1951, BRIT J RADIOL, V24, P46; 1958, RADIOLOGY, V70, P261; 1957, PHYS MED BIOL, V2, P107; 1934, RADIOLOGY, V223, P682; 1933, RADIOLOGY, V21, P212; 1928, BRIT J RADIOL, V1, P358; 1938, RADIOLOGY, V30, P511; 1955, DTSCH MED BOSCH, V81, P1061; 1955, BRIT J RADIOL S, V6	14	3	3	0	1	LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS	PHILADELPHIA	530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA	0017-9078	1538-5159		HEALTH PHYS	Health Phys.

Data from sixteen publications were reviewed and analyzed to estimate the transfer coefficient (f(hm)* having units of d L-1). The data on the radioiodine concentration in breast milk were analyzed by two methods: direct numerical integration and integration of a fitted exponential model. In general, the integrated fitted functions were greater. The fitted functions likely better describe the transfer into milk since few data sets sampled mothers' milk near the time of maximum excretion. The derived transfer coefficient values seem to represent two populations. The first group was those individuals who had very low excretions, including those where thyroid and mammary uptake was impaired by the administration of stable iodine or iodinated compounds. The second group included those with much higher excretions. The second group, termed the "normal-excretion" group, had transfers of iodine to milk that were more than ten-fold higher than in the "low-excretion" group. The derived milk transfer coefficient data for the low- and normal-excretion groups fitted to lognormal distributions gave geometric means, (geometric standard deviations), of 0.043 d L-1 (2.1, n = 14) and 0.37 d L-1 (1.5, n = 12), respectively. Estimates of the effective half-time (time from maximum concentration to half the value) were determined for the low- and normal-excretion groups separately. There was evidence that the effective half-time was longer for the normal- than for the low-excretion group; the geometric mean (and geometric standard deviation) were 12 (1.7) and 8.5 (2.6) h, respectively, though the difference was not statistically significant. The geometric mean times to maximum milk concentration in the low- and normal-excretion groups were nearly identical, 9.4 (3.1) and 9.0 (1.6) h, respectively. The data show that administration of large doses of stable iodine (commonly used to block uptake of iodine into the thyroid) is also an effective means to block radioiodine transfer into milk. Thus, protecting the mother's thyroid also protects the nursing infant. Despite inadequacies of available data describing the transfer of radioiodine to human milk within a healthy population of women, the values of f(hm)* provided here are believed to be the best available for use in radiological assessments. These values are particularly applicable to lactating women having normal diets and availability to stable iodine, as in the United States.

J	Cheng, YS; Zhou, Y; Wang, YS; Inkret, WC; Wermer, JR				Cheng, YS; Zhou, Y; Wang, YS; Inkret, WC; Wermer, JR			Dose estimate of inhaled hafnium tritide using the ICRP 66 lung model	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						inhalation; lungs; human; modeling; dose assessment; International Commission on Radiological; Protection	PARTICLES	Metal tritide is widely used for research, purification, compression, and storage of tritium. The current understanding of metal tritide and its radiation dosimetry for internal exposure is limited, and ICRP publications do not provide the tritium dosimetry for hafnium tritide. The current radiation protection guidelines for metal tritide particles (including hafnium tritide) are based on the assumption that their biological behavior is similar to tritiated water, which is completely absorbed by the body. However, the solubility of metal tritide particles depends on the chemical form of the material. The biological half-live of hafnium tritide particles and the dosimetry of an inhalation exposure to those particles could be quite different from tritiated water. This paper describes experiments on the dissolution rate of hafnium tritide particles in a simulated lung fluid. The results showed that less than 1% of the tritium was dissolved in the simulated lung fluid for hafnium tritide particles after 215 d. The short-term and long-term dissolution half times were 46 and 4.28 x 10(5) d, respectively. This indicates that hafnium tritide is an extremely insoluble material. Self-absorption of beta rays in the hafnium tritide particles was estimated by a numerical method. The dose coefficients were calculated as a function of particle size using in vitro solubility data and a calculated self-absorption factor. The dose coefficient decreased with aerodynamic diameters in the range of 0.25 to 10 mum, mainly because the self-absorption factor decreased with increasing particle size. For a particle 1 mum in aerodynamic diameter, the dose coefficient of a hafnium tritide particle was about 10 times higher than that of tritiated water but was about 1.4 times lower than that calculated by ICRP Publication 71 for Type S tritiated particles. The ICRP estimate did not include a self-absorption factor and thus might have overestimated the dose. This finding has significant implications for current health protection guidelines.

We describe a technique for producing such particles in the micrometer-diameter size range using electrostatic deposition of radon decay products onto otherwise nonradioactive powders of different sizes. An electric field focuses radon decay products (primarily Po-218) onto the surface of a powdered substrate that is then suspended by a technique such as pneumatic dry dispersion. Only a modest-activity commercial Rn-222 source (e.g., containing as little as 10(5) Bq of Ra-226) is required, and issues of radioactive cleanup and contamination are minimized due to the short half-lives (26.8 min or less) of the decay products. We report representative results using powders of glass beads, iron oxide, and iron and gold metals in the size range of 0.3 to 30 mum. Yields for the deposited radioactivity per unit concentration of Rn-228 gas were of the order of 5 x 10(-7) Bq (Bi-214) per milligram substrate per Bq m(-3) of Rn-222 for an electrostatic collection time of 30 min.

Potted rice plants were exposed to D2O vapor in the greenhouse for 8 h, under day or night conditions. Deuterium concentrations in free water and organic matter in rice leaves and ears were investigated until harvest time. The formation of organically bound deuterium in the daytime was higher than during the nighttime by the factors of 2.4 for the ear and 2.9 for the leaf. The decrease of the organically bound deuterium concentration in the ear after the nighttime exposure was faster than that after the daytime exposure. Data analysis was carried out using a compartment model in which different generating processes of organic matter were considered. The calculated organically bound deuterium retention in rice agreed with the measured value.

J	Goddard, CC				Goddard, CC			Measurement of outdoor terrestrial gamma radiation in the Sultanate of Oman	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						gamma radiation; radioactivity; environmental; naturally occurring radionuclides; exposure, population	RADIOACTIVITY	The terrestrial gamma radiation level was determined throughout the Sultanate of Oman over a 3-y period. The dose rate at 1 m above the ground was measured at 512 locations using a compensated Geiger-Muller detector. The activity concentration of soil/rock samples, collected from 112 locations, was determined by gamma spectrometry. Dose rates calculated from the activity concentrations compared well with the measured values corrected for the cosmic ray contribution. Some of the highest terrestrial dose rates, up to 110 nGy h(-1), were measured in shales (Wadi Bani Awf, Saih Hatat, and the Huqf) and exposed basement granites (Jebal Jalan and the Mirbat peninsula). Two small hot spots were found where the maximum dose rate was 1,024 nGy h(-1). The average dose rate in the main population area of the Batinah is 38.5 nGy h(-1) (0.29 mSv y(-1)) and Muscat 44.9 nGy h(-1) (0.34 mSv y(-1)). The mean population weighted dose rate is 39.8 nGy h(-1) (0.30 mSv y(-1)). Most of Oman's surface rock is limestone, which is low in concentrations of radionuclides from the uranium and thorium series. Hence, the average dose rate is well below the world average of 0.45 mSv y(-1).

The application of this model is demonstrated by estimating effluxes in the Bragin region and in the Narovlya region in the Republic of Belarus both highly affected by the Chernobyl accident fallout. Depending on the nature of the area and the deposition, the total efflux and the exported radioactivity are calculated. It is shown that the exported radioactivity for natural foodstuffs represents more than 64% (Bragin region) and 86% (Narovlya region) of the total Cs-137 efflux, and for agricultural products 2.7% and 2.3%, respectively. The contribution of the different foodstuffs deriving from natural and agricultural used land to the individual and collective dose for Cs-137 and Sr-90 are estimated and presented. In the Bragin region for the collective annual dose the highest contribution is due to milk and meat consumption (Cs-137) and flour and milk (Sr-90), for individual annual dose milk and mushrooms (Cs-137), and milk and flour (Sr-90) contribute most. In the Narovlya region this contribution for the collective and individual annual dose is due to milk and mushroom consumption (Cs-137) and flour and milk (Sr-90).
