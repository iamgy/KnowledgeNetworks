Two technological schemes are developed. They include nitric-fluoride-acid treatment of glass-paper in a mixture of nitric and hydrofluoric acids and preliminary alkaline treatment of the glass-paper followed by nitric-fluoride-acid leaching of plutonium from the pulp by a mixture of nitric and hydrofluoric acids. The technology proposed will make it possible to obtain secondary waste (with respect to plutonium content) and insoluble residues, which will then be utilized by well-known technological techniques: monolithization, vitrification, and others.

J	Schuppner, SMH				Schuppner, SMH			The US nuclear future: DOE initiatives to advance nuclear energy in the United States	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			English	Article								Also under the impact of the events on September 11, 2001, the United States regards long-term, reliable planning for the future structure of the country's energy supply an important activity to be addressed by all parties involved in politics, industry, and research. In the light of the existing resource situation, the importance of reliable energy supply, and the necessary, protection of the environment and the world climate, a balanced interaction is sought of energy, ecology, and economy. The special objectives pursued include increased efficiency in energy use and energy conservation, modernization of the infrastructure in the energy sector, and diversification of energy supply. The structure of the US power plant park and the expected increases in electricity consumption are likely to give rise to the need to add approximately 390,000 to 570,000 MW of new generating capacity over the next twenty years. In this connection. nuclear power is expected to play an important role as a safe, non-polluting, economic source of energy. The Department of Energy therefore also supports initiatives seeking to extend the licenses of existing nuclear power plants and to promote research and development of future 4th generation reactors in national and international programs. In addition, work is supported which deals, e.g., with matters of transmutation, the repository storage of radioactive residues, and the implementation of safeguards measures.

As the domestic potential is largely exhausted, and as both ecological objectives, such as the protection of the climate, and the goals spelt out in the Green Paper of the EU Commission of reduced dependence on imports are to be achieved, the construction of a new, fifth nuclear power plant is planned among other measures. The plant is to have 1000 to 1600 MW power, which is to meet part of the 7500 MW of new generating capacity considered necessary by 2020. The formal procedure about a future application for a construction license is in an advanced stage of development, having recently passed the Finnish cabinet with a positive vote. The Finnish parliament is expected to take its decision by the earl), summer this year. An important point in the acceptance of nuclear power in Finland, in addition to the non-polluting character and the economic advantages of this power source, is the consistent, transparent way in which the waste management issue is being handled, A site of a central spent fuel repository near the Olkiluoto nuclear power plant site is in its first phase of exploration above ground. Both the local population and the parliament approved the project. If a positive overall result is achieved, the repository could well be commissioned in the next decade.

J							Int Landerkommission K	ILK statement on reprocessing spent fuel International Nuclear Technology Committee (ILK)	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								In its statement about reprocessing spent fuel the International Nuclear Technology Committee (ILK) extensively covers these main points: radiological consequences of reprocessing; interim storage and final storage of spent fuel; comparison of the costs associated with direct disposal versus those arising from reprocessing once and partitioning and transmutation (P&T). Direct disposal and the waste management and recycling path including reprocessing are considered equal alternatives. With a view to future technical developments and possible options of combined reactors and accelerator systems the Committee recommends that research and development work on the management of spent nuclear fuel be funded at an adequate level. New technologies are not considered reason enough for further delaying the question of final storage in Germany which, after all, has been solved technically. However, the option should be used to ensure that the material emplaced in a repository can be retrieved for further use as long as the repository is in operation.

It is found that various combinations of deuterium alone and deuterium with impurities (helium, nitrogen, argon, and krypton) can provide acceptable runaway-free thermal shutdown. The admixture of impurities cited reduces the quantity of deuterium needed and also reduces the radiative cooling time needed for the plasma to reach final thermal equilibrium, where radiation losses balance ohmic input. In contrast, the addition of neon does not appreciably reduce deuterium quantity or promote faster cooling. This difference relative to the other impurity studies can be understood from the radiation versus plasma temperature characteristics for neon.

The present design concept is based on nuclear, processing, and fusion technologies that either exist or are at an advanced stage of development and on the existing tokamak plasma physics database. An FTWR, operating with k(eff) less than or equal to 0.95 at a thermal power output of similar to3 GW and with a fusion neutron source operating at Q(p) = 1.5 to 2, could fission the transuranic content of similar to100 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel per full-power year and would be self-sufficient in both electricity and tritium production. In equilibrium, a nuclear fleet consisting of light water reactors (LWRs) and FYWRs in the electrical power ratio of 311 would reduce by 99.4% the actinides discharged into the waste stream from the LWRs in a once-through fuel cycle that must be stored in high-level waste repositories.

Among these parameters, the activity median aerodynamic diameter (AMAD), specific surface area (SSA), and parameters describing absorption to blood f(r), s(r) and s(s) defined in ICRP Publication 66 were identified as the most relevant influencing dose assessment. This study reviewed the data for 25 pure and impure uranium compounds. The average value of AMAD obtained was 5.7 mum (range 1.1-8.5 mum), which strongly supports the choice of 5 mum as the default value of AMAD for occupational exposures. The SSA varied between 0.4 and 18.3 m(2) g(-1). For most materials, values of the absorption parameters f(r), S-r, and s(s) derived from the in vitro experiments were generally consistent with those derived from the in vivo experiments. Using average values for each pure compound allowed us to classify UO2 and U3O8 as Type S, mixed oxides, UF4, UO3 and ADU as Type M, and UO4 as Type F based on the ICRP Publication 71 criteria. Dose coefficients were also calculated for each pure compound, and average values for each type of pure compound were compared with those derived using default values. Finally, the lung retention kinetics and urinary excretion rates for inhaled UO3 were compared using material-specific and default absorption parameters, in order to give a practical example of the application of this study.

J	Ogata, Y; Nishizawa, K				Ogata, Y; Nishizawa, K			In situ calibration and evaluation of the accuracy of a waste water monitoring system	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						water; waste management; calibration; detector, scintillation		A new method to estimate the reliability of a waste water monitoring system was developed and substantiated. To estimate the reliability means (1) to verify the representativeness of the sample fed into the monitoring system, and (2) to calibrate the detectors of the monitoring system. To verify the representativeness, test water spiked with P-32 was prepared in a storage tank, and the monitoring system was operated. For all of the experiments, the radioactivity concentrations of the water fed into the monitoring system agreed well with those of the water in the storage tank at 725 +/- 45 s after the start of the sampling pump. Therefore, the representativeness was verified. Calibration was carried out with active water in the storage tank and in a specially designed calibration tank. The efficiency of a plastic scintillation detector (PSD), one of the detectors used in the monitoring system, for P-32 was determined to be 4.91 +/- 0.10%. Using the calibration tank significantly reduced the cost and labor for calibration. In addition, calibration with natural potassium (K-40) proved to be effective for periodic checks of the detector.

J	Siegel, JA; Sparks, RB				Siegel, JA; Sparks, RB			Radioactivity appearing at landfills in household trash of nuclear medicine patients: Much ado about nothing?	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						nuclear medicine; medical radiation; waste disposal; radiation, low-level	RECYCLED METALS; WASTE; DISPOSAL; THERAPY	The U.S. NRC in 1997 removed its arbitrary 1.11 GBq (30 mCi) rule, which had been in existence for almost 50 y, and now many more patients receiving radionuclide therapy in nuclear medicine can be treated as outpatients. However, another problem has the potential to limit the short-lived reality of outpatient treatment unless nuclear medicine practitioners and the health physics community gets involved. Radioactive articles in the household trash of nuclear medicine patients are appearing at solid waste landfills that have installed radiation monitors to prevent the entry of any detectable radioactivity, and alarms are going off around the country. These monitors are set to alarm at extremely low activity levels. Some states may actually hold licensees responsible if a patient's radioactive household trash is discovered in a solid waste stream; this is another major reason [along with continued use of the 1.11 GBq (30 mCi) rule] why many licensees are still not releasing their radionuclide therapy patients. This is in spite of the fact that the radioactivity contained in released nuclear medicine therapy patients, let alone the much lower activity level contained in their potentially radioactive household wastes, poses a minimal hazard to the public health and safety or to the environment. Currently, there are no regulations governing the disposal of low-activity, rapidly-decaying radioactive materials found in the household trash of nuclear medicine patients, the performance of landfill radiation monitors, or the necessity of spectrometry equipment. Resources are, therefore, being unnecessarily expended by regulators and licensees in responding to radiation monitor alarms that are caused by these unregulated short-lived materials that may be mixed with municipal trash. Recommendations are presented that would have the effect of modifying the existing landfill regulations and practices so as to allow the immediate disposal of such wastes.

J	Strom, DJ; Watson, CR				Strom, DJ; Watson, CR			On being understood: Clarity and jargon in radiation protection	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						education, health physics; public information; journal content; quality assurance	UNITS	While much of the language used to express the concepts of radiation protection works effectively, there are many ill-chosen names and phrases and much jargon that permeate our professional speech and writing. From the oxymoron "internal exposure" to the "snarl word" "decay," there is much room for improvement. This essay identifies many of the problems and suggests solutions. We examine the kinds of confusions that can result from using familiar words with unfamiliar meanings and the need for neology. We offer insights into specific and unambiguous naming of physical quantities and explore the seemingly unlimited kinds of "dose." We disaggregate exposure from irradiation following intakes, and unmask units like "gram rad per microcurie hour." We call for a definition of radiation weighting factor that doesn't result in a violation of the law of conservation of energy. We examine the subtleties of distinguishing between radiation and radioactive materials. Some words, such as "exposure," have multiple meanings, while at other times there are different words or phrases with the same meaning, such as "critical level" and "decision level" or "detection level" and "minimum detectable amount." Sometimes phrases are used whose meaning is unclear or not agreed upon, such as "lower limit of detection." Sometimes there are words that are simply not apt, such as "disintegration" applied to the emission of a subatomic particle from a nucleus.

J	Emery, RJ; Orders, AB; McCrary, JR; Charlton, MA				Emery, RJ; Orders, AB; McCrary, JR; Charlton, MA			An evaluation and comparison of compliance inspection outcomes data for radiation protection programs in Maine and Texas	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topics; safety standards; regulations; radiation protection		The coding system used by the State of Texas Department of Health Bureau of Radiation Control to categorize regulatory violations resulting from compliance inspections was applied to the results of similar activities performed by the State of Maine Radiation Control Program for licensees of radioactive materials in calendar year 1999. The coded results from the Maine inspections (n = 37) were then summarized and compared to the data from Texas inspection activities for similar radiation licenses (n = 1,350). Despite significant differences in program size, age, and geographic proximity, the list of most commonly issued violations was almost identical. Other program outcome analogies were also noted, such as similar violation frequency distributions and similar identified root causes of non-compliance. These comparisons mark the first step towards the possible creation of a generalizable list of common items of non-compliance, which could serve to greatly enhance radiation safety preventive education and training programs. The utility of the Texas coding system as the basis for interstate program comparisons is also demonstrated, since the system is based upon categories of non-compliance rather than locally-unique regulatory codes or citations.

J	Little, MP				Little, MP			Comparisons of lung tumour mortality risk in the Japanese A-bomb survivors and in the Colorado Plateau uranium miners: support for the ICRP lung model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION BIOLOGY			English	Article							CANCER MORTALITY; ALPHA-PARTICLES; BIOLOGICAL EFFECTIVENESS; LOW FLUENCES; EXPOSURE; COHORT; RADIATION; INDUCTION; CARCINOGENESIS; MODIFIERS	Purposes : To estimate the ratio of risks for exposure to radon progeny relative to low-LET radiation based on human lung cancer data, taking account of possible time and age variations in radiation-induced lung cancer risk. Materials and methods : Fitting two sorts of time- and age-adjusted relative risk models to a case-control dataset nested within the Colorado Plateau uranium miner cohort and to the Japanese atomic (A)-bomb survivor mortality data. Results : If all A-bomb survivors are compared with the Colorado data, there are statistically significant (two-sided p<0.05) differences between the two datasets in the pattern of the variation of relative risk with time after exposure, age at exposure and attained age. The excess relative risk decreases much faster with time, age at exposure and attained age in the Colorado uranium miners than in the Japanese A-bomb survivors. If only male A-bomb survivors are compared with the Colorado data, there are no longer statistically significant differences between the two datasets in the pattern of variation of relative risk with time after exposure, age at exposure or attained age. There are no statistically significant differences between the male and female A-bomb survivors in the speed of reduction of relative risk with time after exposure, age at exposure or attained age, although there are indications of rather faster reduction of relative risk with time and age among male survivors than among female survivors. The implicit risk conversion factor for exposure to radon progeny relative to the A-bomb radiation in the male survivors is 1.8 x 10(-2) Sv WLM-1 (95% CI 6.1 x 10(-3), 1.1 x 10(-1)) using a model with exponential adjustments for the effects of radiation for time since exposure and age at exposure, and 1.9 x 10(-2) Sv WLM-1 (95% CI 6.2 x 10(-3), 1.6 x 10(-1)) using a model with adjustments for the effects of radiation proportional to powers of time since exposure and attained age. Estimates of the risk conversion factor calculated using variant assumptions as to the definition of lung cancer in the Colorado data, or by excluding miners for whom exposure estimates may be less reliable, are very similar. The absence of information on cigarette smoking in the Japanese A-bomb survivors, and the possibility that this may confound the time trends in radiation-induced lung cancer risk in that cohort, imply that these findings should be interpreted with caution. Conclusions : There are no statistically significant differences between the male A- bomb survivors data and the Colorado miner data in the pattern of variation of relative risk with time after exposure and age at exposure.

Materials and methods: Cerium-141 in chloride solution was administered intravenously to rats at different stages of pregnancy (days 9.5, 12. 5 or 18.5), and retention in the embryo/fetus and associated tissues was measured 3 days later in each case. Retention in rat fetal tissues on day 21.5 (shortly before birth) was also measured after administration of Ce-141 chloride 1 month prior to conception or Ce-141 citrate on day 18.5. Cerium-141 chloride was administered to guinea pigs on day 50 for measurements of fetal retention on day 57 (shortly before birth). Results: Retention of Ce-141 in the rat embryo/fetus, measured at 3 days after administration to the mother, increased from about 0.00002% of injected activity per embryo/fetus on day 12.5 to about 0.014% on day 21.5 of gestation. However, the relative concentrations of Ce-141 in the embryo/fetus and mother (C-F:C-M ratio) were between 0.005 and 0.01 in each case. After Ce-141 administration prior to conception, retention by the rat fetus on day 21.5 was substantially lower than after short-term administration. Comparison of retention of Ce-141 on day 21.5 after administration on day 18.5 as either chloride or citrate showed similar levels in maternal tissues but greater transfer to the fetus (C-F:C-M ratio of 0.03). Retention in the guinea pig fetus in late gestation at 7 days after administration of Ce-141 chloride was about 0.05% injected activity per fetus, corresponding to a C-F:C-M ratio of about 0.02. Conclusion: These results and other published animal data have been used to specify C-F:C-M ratios for use in the calculation of doses to the human fetus. The values used were 0.05 for intakes during pregnancy and 0.01 for intakes prior to conception. Doses to the offspring after maternal ingestion of Ce-141 or Ce-144 are largely due to irradiation from activity in the maternal colon and are insensitive to C-F :C-M. After inhalation, however, absorption of Ce to blood is much greater and doses to the offspring are dominated by the contribution from activity in the fetus, and therefore dependent on the C-F:C-M ratio used.

A scanning continuous wave Nd laser beam heated the codeposits to a temperature of 1200-2300 degreesC for 10-200 ms in an argon atmosphere. The temperature rise of the codeposit was significantly higher than that of the manufactured tile material (e.g. 1770 degreesC cf. 1080 degreesC). A major fraction of tritium was thermally desorbed with minimal change to the surface at a laser intensity of 80 W/mm(2), peak temperatures above 1230 degreesC and heating duration 10-20 ms. In two experiments, 46% and 84% of the total tritium was released during the laser scan. The application of this method for tritium removal from a tokamak reactor appears promising and has significant advantages over oxidative techniques. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the glasses, uranium is present at oxidation state VI and coordination number 6 with the same average distances than those found in a UO3 type environment. The U-O distances and uranium coordination numbers are identical throughout the uranium concentration range. During glass alteration the uranium remains at oxidation state VI in the gels, but was found in the uranyl form. An increase in the equatorial distances (from 2.20 and 2.32 Angstrom in the glass to respectively 2.22 and 2.39 Angstrom in the gel) and coordination numbers (to about 7 and 8, respectively) was observed.

Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) was used to measure the radial distributions of Xe, Cs and Nd in the UO(2) fuel matrix, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to study the change in the UO(2) microstructure across the fuel pellet radius. EPMA showed that a large fraction of the xenon created had been released from the fuel matrix of the high power samples at all radial positions, In these samples, SEM revealed the presence of recrystallised grains at intermediate radial positions where thermal fission gas release had previously occurred. Evidence of recrystallisation was found throughout the pellet cross-sections of the low power samples. It is concluded that recrystallisation of the fuel grains at intermediate radial positions is mainly responsible for the marked increase in fission gas release to the rod free volume at burn-ups above 80 MWd/kgHM.

Both UZr0.29 alloy and uranium metal showed similar hydrogen isotopic effect and hysteresis effect. UZr0.29 alloy absorbed hydrogen (deuterium) up to 2.3H (2.18D) atoms per F.U. (formula unit) by only one-step reaction and hence each desorption isotherm had a single plateau over nearly the whole hydrogen composition range. The UZr0.29 alloy showed a little lower dissociation pressure than that of pure uranium; however, it exhibited high durability against powdering upon hydrogenation and may have good heat conductivity. The UZr0.29 hydride has the potentiality to substitute pure uranium hydride as a material for tritium treatment and storage. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Kolar, M				Kolar, M			Kinetic theory of the growth of the circular oxidation islands on the UO2 surface	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article								Island-like oxidation of a solid surface is studied. Such a process Occurs for example at the beginning of the second stage of the oxidation of UO2 to U3O8, and its study is thus important for handling of used nuclear fuel in intermediate dry air storage. Mathematical formulation of the problem is presented. approximate analytical formulas are derived and discussed for the isothermal case, and the non-isothermal case is studied numerically. It is shown that for the accurate prediction of the UO2 surface oxidation. it is important to know separately the rates of island nucleation and of island-radius growth. Only a certain product of these two rates can be obtained from isothermal experiments. Here we show how one can determine directly the values of the activation energies of both these rates from a series of suitably designed accelerated non-isothermal experiments.

For the purpose of tritium quantification, preparing a specimen of activated concrete without letting tritiated water scatter away is, however, practically impossible. This calls for an alternative means of tritium quantification through indirect estimation from measurement of a substitute radionuclide, such as Eu-152, that is easy to quantify. Many types of concrete and their raw materials were sampled and irradiated by thermal neutrons of the JRR-4 reactor to find out the correlation existing in irradiated concrete between the specific activities of tritium and of Eu-152. The induced activity of for Eu-152 was measured by Ge detector, and that of tritium by liquid scintillation counter. From the results measured on the various types of concrete, the formula obtained empirically between H-3 and Eu-152 was H-3(Bq/g) =Eu-152(Bq/g) x (5-27). Another noteworthy finding is that the ratio of the quantity of tritium induced by thermal neutrons is 1:46 between low-activation concrete and ordinary concrete.

The results of infinite cell burn-up calculations show that Pa-231 has attractive potential to reduce the initial excess-reactivity and to be effectively converted to fissile nuclides U-232 and successively U-233 with the burn-up. These characteristics enable the reactor to sustain nuclear reactions for a longer time. Based on the optimization of the fuel composition and the moderator to fuel ratio, it is found that the high fuel burn-up of about 700 GWd/t is achievable in consideration of the material restriction of coated fuel particles, Safety studies show negative temperature coefficients during the irradiation.

The unknown parameters of the model: the effective diffusion coefficient D-ea and the Langmuir coefficient K were determined by curve fitting of iodine profile experimentally obtained. At 423 K, D-ea and K were found to be 5.60 x 10(7) m(2.)s(-1) and 1.0 x 10(5) m(3.)kg(-1), respectively. Using the parameter values, the model could well predict the iodine profiles obtained at 423 K in the previous works under different experimental conditions. Furthermore, the effect of silver contents on the iodine profiles was reasonably predicted. It was suggested that the proposed model is simple and would be useful to predict the iodine profiles in Ag-S adsorbent columns.

We used a Philips XL,30 scanning electron microscope equipped with an EDAX energy dispersive spectrometer with a Si(Li) detector and a super ultra-thin polymer window and with a Microspec wavelength dispersive spectrometer. A number of WDXRF and EDXRF spectra of U and Pu containing particles were accumulated and evaluated. The software package provided by the manufacturer was used for EDXRF spectra evaluation and calculation of the weight and atomic composition. Eight different U compounds were identified with a different degree of confidence. Several different types of U and Pu particles were measured using the WDXRF spectrometer and the results of the measurements are discussed. The measurement of mixed U-Pu particles showing large differences in the concentration of both elements can best be carried out with the use of WDXRF because the deconvolution of the M lines of U and Pu in the energy dispersive spectra is only possible over a relatively small concentration range. The results of particle analysis are very useful for verifying the absence of undeclared nuclear activities.

We studied the best fitting of all parameters that rule the radioactive yield of tritiation of an unsatured substrate, to guarantee the maximum incorporation of labeled atom in the product at room temperature. The wise choice of experimental parameters allowed very high radiochemical yields. The number of tritium exceeded the statistical presence of two atoms.

All the three phosphine oxides have shown very high extraction of Pu. The order of extraction for Pu by these compounds is cyn-923 > TOPO similar to cyn-925. Loading of Pu (similar to30.0 mg/l) in 3.0M HNO3 was carried out using 5% solution of each of the phosphine oxides in dodecane. It was found that even at an organic to aqueous phase ratio of 1: 10, the loading of Pu is >96%. From the loaded organic phase, Pu could be almost quantitatively stripped using 0.1 or 0.5M oxalic acid. The extraction of Pu(IV) with cyn-925 has also been carried out from HCL HNO3 or HClO4(0.5 to 9.1 M). The species extracted into the cyn-925/dodecane phase from 3.0M HNO3 or HCI media was found to be Pu(L)(4).2 cyn-925 where L = NO3- or Cl-. Similar species were observed to be formed when dodecane was replaced by xylene, chlorobenzene or o-dichlorobenzene.

A multitracer solution, containing more than 20 radioisotopes, was injected intraperitoneally into Zn-deficient state mice and control ones. Uptake rates of the radioisotopes were compared with concentrations of trace elements determined by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) in order to study a specific metabolism of Zn and other essential trace elements, such as Mn, Co, Se, Rb, and Sr. The result suggests that Zn is supplied from bone to other organs and tissues and an increase in Co concentration in all organs and tissues depends on its chemical form. under the Z-deficient state.

India). Sampling was done at five locations: Sharanpur (next to the Himalayan foothills), Delhi, Jagmanpur, Hamirpur and Allahabad. where Yamuna meets the Ganges. The rate of sedimentation derived from both techniques, Cs-137 and Pb-210, appears to be quite similar. At the station Sharanpur the highest rate of sedimentation (5.99 cm/y) was noticed, most probably due to deforestation and other human influences in the Himalayan regions, while the lowest rate was observed in Hamirpur (2.48 cm/y). All the five cores studied showed a Cs-137 peak of 1963, due to radioactive fallout, caused by weapon tests. The three upstream stations (Sharanpur, Delhi and Jagmanpur) showed a Cs-137 peak due to the Chernobyl event. These measurements reflect that Chernobyl debris have been transferred to the low latitude river system across the Himalayas.

Animal and pilot patient studies have demonstrated, that radioiodinated 5-iodo-2-thiouracil is a promising agent for visualization of melanotic melanomas. In this study, 2-bromo-2-thiouracil was labeled using the positron-emitting isotope Br-76 (T-1/2 = 16.2 h), which potentially enables to use such advantages of PET as superior spatial resolution and possibility to quantify radioactivity concentration in vivo. The use of Chloramine-T as oxidant provided a labeling efficiency of about 70%.

The cradle of the nuclides	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ELEMENTS	The nuclear energy surface is presented as three-dimensional (3-D) plots of mass or atomic number versus charge density versus average energy per nucleon. These plots reveal a trough or "cradle of the nuclides." Stable and long-lived nuclides are located in the valley. nose that are radioactive or are easily destroyed by fusion or fission occupy higher positions. Separate modes of nucleosynthesis fill the cradle from different directions and produce distinct occupancy levels, i.e., different abundance patterns. The cradle can be used to estimate the properties of nuclear matter that cannot be studied in the laboratory.

The height equivalent to a theoretical plate and steady-state separation, based on the two models, have been obtained. If only the isotopic exchange between CO2 gas and amine carbamate is considered, the model can estimate the process performance for pressures close to the atmospheric one and room temperature. For process analysis at pressures higher than the atmospheric one and lower temperatures, a two-step model has been used. Using the two models the effects of pressure have been studied.

J	Kozak, V; Dlouhy, I; Holzmann, M				Kozak, V; Dlouhy, I; Holzmann, M			The fracture behaviour of cast steel and its prediction based on the local approach	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th International Conference on Structural Mechanics in Reactor Technology (SMiRT 15)	2001	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA					The master curve (MC) concept has been used for assessment of the fracture toughness transition behaviour of C-Mn cast steel intended for fabrication of large containers for spent nuclear fuel (SKODA). Standard fracture toughness tests using single edge notched bend specimens (SENB) with various crack lengths, the static tests of the CVN specimens and the axisymmetric notched tensile specimens have been utilised. The transferability of results received on the small pre-cracked Charpy specimens are tested here and the methodology MC is applied. For determining the reference transition temperature, T-o, which is taken as a basic material characteristic positioning the MC on the temperature axis, the large (IT) specimens are required.

The subsequent stress redistribution is calculated up to 10,000 years. The canister consists of two concentric cylinders, an inner steel cylinder containing the spent nuclear fuel and an outer copper cylinder. It was found that the maximum plastic strain (plastic + creep) accumulated in the (possibly brittle) heat affected zone is approximate to 7%, which seems to be well below the reported ductility for the copper used.

The GSO crystal is an interesting detector to explore in future neutrino physics experiments. The contributions to background due to the various channels of intrinsic radio isotopes from the Th-232 and U-238 series are identified and studied with time-correlation analysis and detailed fits to the spectral shape. Good agreement is achieved between measured and simulated spectra, indicating that background suppression factors to the 10(-2)-10(-3) level are possible. The procedures can be adopted for background understanding and suppression in other low-count-rate experiments where the dominant source of background is from internal radioactivity. Based tin 1656 h of data taking, limits on the double beta decay half-life for the various channels in Gd-160 are derived. The limits for the neutrinoless and the Majoron modes are T-1/2(0vbetabeta) > 2.0(0.8) x 10(20) yr and Ti-1/2(ybetabeta) > 3.0(1.9) x 10(19) yr, respectively, at 68(90)% confidence level.

A low-background well-type detector is installed in the Modane underground Laboratory. In the well geometry, coincidence-summing effects are high and make construction of the full energy peak efficiency curve difficult with the usual calibration standard, especially in the: high energy range. Using the GEANT code, taking into account a detailed description of the detector and the source, efficiency curves have been modelled for several filling heights of the vial. With a special routine, taking into account the decay schemes of the radionuclides corrections have been computed for coincidence-summing effects that occur when measuring samples containing U-238, Th-232 or Cs-134. The results are found to be in good agreement with experimental data. It is shown that triple coincidences effect on counting losses accounts for 7-15% of pair coincidences effect in the case of the 604 and 796 keV lines of Cs-134. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Bourva, LCA; Croft, S; Weaver, DR				Bourva, LCA; Croft, S; Weaver, DR			The effect of albedo neutrons on the neutron multiplication of small plutonium oxide samples in a PNCC chamber	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article								This paper describes how to evaluate the effect of neutrons reflected from parts of a passive neutron coincidence chamber on the neutron leakage self-multiplication, M-L, of a fissile sample. It is shown that albedo neutrons contribute, in the case of small plutonium bearing samples, to a significant part of M-L, and that their effect has to be taken into account in the relationship between the measured coincidence count rates and the Pu-240 effective mass of the sample. A simple one-interaction model has been used to write the balance of neutron gains and losses in the material when exposed to the re-entrant neutron flux. The energy and intensity profiles of the re-entrant flux have been parameterised using Monte Carlo MCNP(TM) calculations. This technique has been implemented for the On Site Laboratory neutron/gamma counter within the existing MEPL 1.0 code for the determination of the neutron leakage self-multiplication. Benchmark tests of the resulting MEPL 2.0 code with MCNP(TM) calculations showed that for typical safeguard samples the newly developed code estimates (M-L - 1) to within 1% of the MCNP(TM) results. The precision of these results along with the rapidity of the proposed calculation method therefore make the use of a "known M-L" approach for solving the Bohnel equations very attractive when measuring density controlled gram size PuO2 or Mixed Oxide (MOX) samples.

We describe the most important corrections to standard energy-loss formulae. We compare our calculations to an improved measurement of the range of 1 A GeV U ions and to other codes and tabulations. We show that calculations based on the theory of ionization energy loss are at least as accurate as tabulations extrapolated from empirical data for the stopping of uranium ions in matter.

J	Karpuzov, DS; McIntyre, NS				Karpuzov, DS; McIntyre, NS			High-energy particle emission from galena and pyrite bombarded with Cs and O ions	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						sputtering; ion scattering; ion surface impact; SIMS; galena; pyrite	MONTE-CARLO SIMULATION; AU-CU ALLOYS; COMPUTER-SIMULATION; SIMS INSTRUMENT; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; ALTERED LAYER; DISTRIBUTIONS; ATOMS; IONIZATION; SURFACE	The ejection of energetic particles during steady-state ion surface bombardment has been investigated by means of a dynamic computer simulation as well as in a secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS)/low-energy ion scattering from surfaces (LEIS) experiment. The emphasis of this comparative study is on the mass dependence of high-energy tails in sputtering and backscattering for the bombardment of galena (PbS) and pyrite (FeS2) with keV energy ion beam of cesium and oxygen. In the experiment, kinetic energy distributions of sputtered secondary ions (S+, Fe+, Pb+, S-), as well as backscattered or re-sputtered primary ions (Cs+, O+, O-), have been measured on a modified Cameca IMS-3f magnetic sector mass spectrometer for keV cesium (Cs+) and oxygen (O-2(+), O-) bombardment of galena and pyrite. Ejection of 2 high-energy particles, with emission energies of up to similar to40% or up to similar to60% of the bombarding energy for sputtering of the lighter component (S+) with cesium or oxygen, respectively, and of up to similar to40% (Cs+) and similar to80% (O+/-) for backscattering, has been observed for PbS. The computer simulations were based on the well-known MARLOWE code. In order to model the change of the stoichiometry of the binary compounds, dynamic modification of the target composition in the near-surface region was introduced. Cs incorporation was included, and a relative enrichment of the metallic component (Pb, Fe) in the top few layers due to preferential sputtering of sulfur was allowed. The computer simulations provide information on the formation of altered layer under sputter equilibrium as well as on the energy and angular emission distributions of sputtered and backscattered particles in steady-state conditions. Multiple scattering of Cs projectiles and dynamic resputtering of cesium that was previously incorporated in the altered near-surface region can be distinguished in the simulation, and matched with the experimental observations. In addition, information on the inverse velocity dependence of ion formation can be obtained from the comparison of the SIMS/LEIS experiment and the computer simulation.

To this aim a hydrogen or deuterium plasma is created in a hybrid multicusp plasma source. We investigate Balmer alpha emission from the multicusp plasma and the output pressure behind a superpermeable niobium membrane immersed in the plasma. The output pressure is proportional to the flux of atoms and ions arriving on the membrane. We find that both output pressure and excited atoms emission satisfy plasma parameters relations. It is thus verified that plasma-driven superpermeation of hydrogen is due essentially to neutral atoms from the plasma incident to the membrane. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Most part of the T-1/2 measurements performed up to now was made with proportional chambers, and the results were sometimes hardly reproducible within the error limits, Using Ge-detectors for that purpose brought some significant advantages but electronic unit related effects and spectra analysis procedures still remain the sources of the errors influencing the accuracy of the T-1/2 attained. In this work, La-140 samples were obtained in the La-130(n, gamma)La-140 reaction, employing a microtron as a neutron source and the half-life measurements were performed with a HPGe-detector. Influencing factors such as photopeak and background shape, electronic circuitry dead time and deadtime variations during the measurements, as well as pulse pileup are studied altogether. Values of the La-140 T-1/2 = 1.6808(18) d, lambda = 0.47749(20) x 10(-5), agreeing within the uncertainities with the most accurate evaluated ones (T-1/2 = 1.6781(3) d, lambda = 0.47807(9) x 10(-5)) [2] were obtained in two series of measurements.

But, tritium is also produced when beryllium is irradiated with 14-MeV neutrons emitted from the fusion of deuterium and tritium ions. Among the two exit channels of the Be-9(n, t) Li-7 reaction of similar to14-MeV incident-neutron energy, the Be-9(n, t(1), gamma)Li-7 channel also emits a 0.478-MeV gamma ray. The purpose of the present study is to measure the cross section for the Be-9 (n, t(1), gamma)Li-7 reaction and also that of the more general Be-9(n, xgamma)Li-7 reaction with the production of the same 0.478-MeV gamma ray for incident-neutron energies from the 12-MeV threshold to 200 MeV Because the Li-7 levels excited above 0.478 MeV are unstable against particle emission, the study of the Be-9(n, t(1), gamma)Li-7 reaction gives direct access to the cross section for the formation of Li-7* in its 0.478-MeV excited state. The few previous experimental data for this reaction are restricted to incident-neutron energies of similar to14 MeV with large discrepancies between the results. The present data are obtained with a BeO sample, using the pulsed source of high-energy neutrons of the Weapons Neutron Research Facility (WNR) at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE). The 478-keV gamma rays emitted in Be-9 (n, xgamma)Li-7 reactions are detected with two high-resolution Ge detectors. The data thus obtained are presented and compared with previous data on the Be-9(n, t(1), gamma)Li-7 and the Be-9(n, t)Li-7 reactions. Examination of the present data also provides insight into the Be-10 level scheme.

J	Wehmann, U; Kinjo, H				Wehmann, U; Kinjo, H			Studies on plutonium burning in the prototype fast breeder reactor Monju	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article								Studies have been performed on plutonium burning in the Japanese prototype fast breeder reactor Monju. The main aims of these studies were to illustrate the plutonium-burning capabilities of fast reactors and to investigate the consequences of the related core design measures on the main core characteristics of Monju. Burner cores with diluting pins, with diluting subassemblies (also called diluents), and with an internal slice of inert material have been investigated; these require an increased average plutonium enrichment and thus offer an enhanced plutonium-burning rate. On the other hand, the consequences of the elimination of the radial and/or axial blanket have been investigated. Among the burner concepts, the B4C containing diluents have been found to be preferable because they cause the smallest maximum linear rating increase and offer the largest flexibility to adapt their reactivity via a modification of the B4C content. They also do not require a new fuel subassembly concept. For the case of the blanket elimination, the replacement of the blankets by steel reflectors has been found to be the best solution. The main consequence of the elimination of both blankets is the increase of the maximum linear rating by up to 11%. Whether this increase may lead to problems will depend on the actual linear power level of the core.
