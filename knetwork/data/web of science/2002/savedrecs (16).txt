The original measurements of regional surface deposition of fallout nuclides were with duplicate gummed film collectors. Later, collectors were established in a worldwide network to measure total deposition and specific radionuclides such as Sr-90 and Cs-137, which evolved into the first large-scale, global environmental monitoring network. Programs were set up to determine dietary intake and human and animal tissue distribution of Sr-90 and Cs-137. Some of the first measurements of natural background dietary radium and body potassium were a response to identify analog elements. The impact of the environmental measurements made for fallout went far beyond any dosimetric consequences. For example, present day information on bone tissue turnover rates are derived mainly from radiochemical analysis of Sr-90 measurements in human bone. The spin off from the enormous expenditure in effort to make these measurements and to determine the health consequences of global fallout laid a rich basic and applied scientific foundation in many disciplines, particularly in exposure pathways from ground deposition to dietary uptake and human organ biokinetics.

Measurements of the concentrations in air of radionuclides were used to verify trajectories derived solely from weather data. The profiles of radioactive concentration along the aircraft tracks were non-Gaussian. High-flying aircraft and balloons collected air and particulate samples to approximately 30,000 in from Alaska to South America. The measurements from these samples were used in verifying stratospheric motions on a hemispheric and global scale. Other benefits to the atmospheric sciences gained during the nuclear testing era are briefly described.

J	Bennett, BG				Bennett, BG			Worldwide dispersion and deposition of radionuclides produced in atmospheric tests	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	37th Annual Meeting of the National-Council-on-Radiation-Protection-and-Measurements	APR 04-05, 2001	ARLINGTON, VA	Natl Council Radiat Protect & Measurements		fallout; atmospheric testing; monitoring; meteorological; National Council on Radiation Protection	FALLOUT	Radionuclides produced in atmospheric nuclear tests were widely dispersed in the global environment. From the many measurements of the concentrations in air and the deposition amounts, much was learned of atmospheric circulation and environmental processes. Based on these results and the reported fission and total yields of individual tests, it has been possible to devise an empirical model of the movement and residence times of particles in the various atmospheric regions. This model, applied to all atmospheric weapons tests, allows extensive calculations of air concentrations and deposition amounts for the entire range of radionuclides produced throughout the testing period. Especially for the shorter-lived fission radionuclides, for which measurement results at the time of the tests are less extensive, a more complete picture of levels and isotope ratios can be obtained, forming a basis for improved dose estimations. The contributions to worldwide fallout can be inferred from individual tests, from tests at specific sites, or by specific countries. Progress was also made in understanding the global hydrological and carbon cycles from the tritium and C-14 measurements. A review of the global measurements and modeling results is presented in this paper. In the future, if injections of materials into the atmosphere occur, their anticipated motions and fates can be predicted from the knowledge gained from the fallout experience.

The start of the 21st century is an appropriate vantage point in time to reflect on the fate of this unique suite of manmade radionuclides-of which more than two-thirds arrived at the surface of the oceans of the planet. During these five decades much has been learned of the behavior and fate of these radionuclides and, through their use as unique tracers, of how they have contributed to the growth of basic knowledge of complex oceanic physical and biogeochemical processes. Some of the highlights of the ways in which fallout radionuclides have given new insights into these processes are reviewed in the historical context of technological and basic ocean science developments over this period. The review addresses major processes involved, such as physical dispersion and mixing, particle association and transport of reactive nuclides, biological interactions, and mixing and burial within ocean sediments. These processes occur over a range of scales ranging from local to global.

The physical processes considered include the interception of radionuclides by vegetation, resuspension, and vertical migration in soil. United States and Russian results on the interception of radionuclides are reviewed and defined in terms of models that are currently undergoing evaluation and revision. New results on resuspension are evaluated, and a preliminary new model for the time-dependent resuspension factor is proposed. Chernobyl-related results on the movement of radionuclides into the soil column are presented, as is a revised model for this process based upon recent results from Ukraine.

Because it is these fundamental, natural processes that control the transport and accumulation of such trace substances in the environment, direct measurements of trace substances over time and space reveal strong insights into these processes. The necessity to monitor global fallout transport, although largely motivated by human health concerns, gave rise to a plethora of new information about plants, animals, and natural and agricultural ecosystems and how they function. This review provides a small selection of examples in the areas of plant and animal physiology, productivity and energy transfer in food chains, biogeochemical cycles of certain elements and their analogues, feeding relationships and movements of organisms, and the agriculture-based human food chain. It is concluded that if society is to cope successfully with continued growth of the human population and resource consumption, more knowledge is still required about these fundamental processes. The use of radiotracers can contribute greatly to this need, but current funding priorities, societal attitudes, and onerous regulations on the use of radioactivity may continue to limit such applications.

The nuclear tests were conducted by five nations (United States. Soviet Union, United Kingdom, France, and China) primarily at 16 sites. The 16 testing sites, located in nine different countries on five continents (plus Oceania) contributed nearly all of the radioactive materials released to the environment by atmospheric testing; only small amounts were released at a few other minor testing sites. The 16 sites discussed here are Nevada Test Site, USA (North American continent), Bikini and Enewetak, Marshall Islands (Oceania); Johnston Island, USA (Oceania), Christmas and Malden Island, Kiribati (Oceania); Emu Field, Maralinga, and Monte Bello Islands, Australia (Australian continent); Mururoa and Fangataufa, French Polynesia (Oceania), Reggane, Algeria (Africa), Novaya Zemlya and Kapustin Yar, Russia (Europe), Semipalatinsk, Kazakhstan (Asia), and Lop Nor, China (Asia). There were Large differences in the numbers of tests conducted at each location and in the total explosive yields. Those factors, as well as differences in population density, lifestyle, environment, and climate at each site, led to large differences in the doses received by local populations. In general, the tests conducted earliest led to the highest individual and population exposures, although the amount of information available for a few of these sites is insufficient to provide any detailed evaluation of radiation exposures. The most comprehensive information for any site is for the Nevada Test Site. The disparities in available information add difficulty to determining the radiation exposures of local populations at each site. It is the goal of this paper to summarize the available information on external and internal doses received by the public living in the regions near each of the mentioned nuclear test sites as a consequence of local fallout deposition.

Most large dealers and processors have monitoring devices that detect radiation sources at their scale house or feed to the furnaces. For example, in Florida since July 1995, a fiscal year average of 41 such alarms has been reported to the Department of Health's Bureau of Radiation Control. The majority of these alarms involve small amounts of radioactive material, usually naturally occurring radioactive material such its Ra-226, contained in luminous dials or scale associated with mining activities in the state. Occasionally, industrial devices that contain radioactive source material are found. The Bureau classifies these alarms as incidents, and inspectors are dispatched to help identify the source and determine the disposition of the material. On 13 July 2001, a steel mill in north Florida reported that a Cs-137 source had been melted in their furnace. This paper describes the actions undertaken by the Bureau in assessing the extent of contamination and subsequent cleanup activities undertaken by the mill.

To develop an understanding of the radiation safety needs or this country, the fall 2001 University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Public Health Environmental Radiation and Radioactivity class was tasked with the assignment of assessing the possible radiation safety needs and concerns for this country. The assignment culminated in a class presentation to the membership of the South Texas Chapter during its annual rail meeting. Using library and web based resources, the students reviewed a number of public health anti radiation-related topics. Life expectancies were found to be equivalent to the United States, even though significant differences in per capita health expenditures were noted. Costa Rica exhibited lower population mortality rates from major causes such as cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, and external sources. Maternal anti infant mortality rates were found to be much higher in Costa Rica than in the United States. Naturally occurring radiation sources such as uranium deposits were not identified as apparent major radiation issues of concern, although ultraviolet radiation exposures are consistently high. Several recent events in the country anti the region involving patient overexposures suggest that concerns are likely focused on ensuring the proper use and maintenance of healing arts radiation equipment. The lack of available information on radioactive waste disposal suggests that waste handling also may be an issue warranting attention. The exercise proved to be very educational for the students, and the information gathered will serve to focus the Chapter's efforts when technical exchanges are initiated. The importance of linking this initiative to other existing programs within the country is also discussed.

J	Hageman, JP				Hageman, JP			Handling, storage, treatment, and disposal of mixed wastes at medical facilities and academic institutions	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topic; waste management; waste storage; waste disposal		Mixed waste includes hazardous/toxic chemicals and radioactive materials mixed together. Most mixed wastes are difficult and costly to work with safely. Meeting the legal and regulatory requirements to generate, use, store, treat, and dispose of mixed waste can also be costly and difficult. The regulations that govern mixed waste, from creation to final disposition, are extensive and complex to implement. Complete and documented compliance with the applicable regulations is essential to demonstrate that personnel and environment safety has been assured. Noncompliance with the multitude of government's requirements for mixed waste can lead to serious repercussions. Noncompliance may cause serious harm to individuals and the environment, fines and penalties against a facility, and/or suspension of a facility's operations. Each facility that generates, uses, or possesses mixed waste must employ adequate expertise to assure full regulatory compliance. This paper introduces the large scope and variety of mixed waste and the current and potential methods to treat and ultimately dispose of, or recycle, mixed waste. Alternatives for regulatory compliance tire also discussed and effective means to control mixed waste are presented. The paper is based on my Master's Thesis (Hageman 2001).

It was found from over 40 smears taken during a two week period that surface removable activity from Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material (NORM) can be predicted to be within a factor of 2 or 3 using either a fixed air sampler measurement or even another smear measurement from a specified surface. The method is being used to take credit for background surface removable activity in similar fashion to a background count for any other radiation detector, The utility of this technique is also discussed from an operational health physics perspective for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant.

J	Krieger, K; Van Baalen, M; Walters, C				Krieger, K; Van Baalen, M; Walters, C			Radioactive waste minimization at a large academic medical facility	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topic; waste management; waste storage; waste disposal		The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston is a large academic medical center with about 12,700 employees, 350 radioisotope research labs and 200 permitted radioactive materials users. Consequently, UTMB generates a fairly large amount of radioactive waste. The majority of this waste contains short-lived radionuclides, such as (32)p, P-33, and S-35, which are held for decay and then disposed at a sanitary landfill. However, some waste, including long-lived waste and stock vials, is compacted into drums and stored in a warehouse facility, on-site, until disposal at a low-level radioactive waste (LLRW) facility. Space in the warehouse is limited but disposal is currently Cost Prohibitive. A reevaluation of our program was conducted to see if volumes of LLRW requiring disposal at a commercial LLRW facility could be reduced. A reevaluation of the waste streams resulted in the shifting of most of the material that was being drummed for shipment to a LLRW facility to disposal by landfill or incineration. Materials that were previously assumed to be radioactive are now being evaluated prior to disposal to determine if they, may be disposed of as non-radioactive waste. Following the initial evaluation, the amount of compacted dry solids assumed to contain long-lived radionuclides was reduced. The space that was saved due to the decrease in drumming for disposal is now used to hold the increased volume of decay-in-storage material. The monetary savings will amount to about $45,000 per year. This program is currently being expanded to reduce other waste streams at the university.

J	Chevalier, PY; Fischer, E; Cheynet, B				Chevalier, PY; Fischer, E; Cheynet, B			Progress in the thermodynamic modelling of the O-U binary system	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Review							SOLID-SOLUTIONS; PHASE; UO2+X	The fuel of civil nuclear plants, UO2, melts at 3120 K. During an hypothetical severe accident, urania, submitted to high temperatures and various oxygen potentials, presents a wide non-stoichiometry range: the melting temperature of UO2+/-x related to oxygen potential, decreases in all cases. In this scenario, urania could react with other materials, firstly zircaloy, and the melting temperature of (U, Zr)O2+/-x, still decreases. That is why the critical assessment of the O-U binary system including the non-stoichiometry range of urania, is a major step to a correct thermodynamic modelling of multicomponent systems for nuclear safety. The very numerous experimental information has been compiled and analysed. The associate model was used for the liquid phase, and a sublattice model for UO2+/-x; U4O9-x, U3O8 and UO3 were treated as stoichiometric. Phase diagram and thermodynamic properties have been calculated from the optimised Gibbs energy parameters. The calculated consistency with the experimental ones is quite satisfactory.

J	Kurepin, VA				Kurepin, VA			Thermodynamic properties of hyperstoichiometric urania in the UO2-UO2.25 solid solution range	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							UO2+X	Experimental data by Nakamura and Fujino [J. Nucl, Mater. 149 (1987) 80] on the x-T-p(O-2) relations for hyperstoichiometric urania between 773 and 1373 K have been used for the assessment of thermodynamic properties of the UO2-UO2.25 solid solution series. The relative partial thermodynamic functions of UO2 and UO2.25 in the UO2-O-2 and UO2-UO2.25 systems have been calculated using the Gibbs-Duhem equation. The results enable one to determine activity-composition relations and other thermodynamic mixing properties of UO2+x and thermodynamic properties of the UO2.25 end-member. The UO2 activity and its entropic contribution have positive deviations from the mole fraction of the UO2 end-member in the entire stability range of urania except the near stoichiometric region. A peculiar property of urania are non-zero values of these functions at the second end-member composition. Beyond the near stoichiometric region, the entropy of mixing of UO2-x is approximately half of that of an ideal one-site solid solution, and the enthalpy of mixing is positive.

J	Barchevtsev, V; Artisyuk, V; Ninokata, H				Barchevtsev, V; Artisyuk, V; Ninokata, H			Concept of erbium doped uranium oxide fuel cycle in light water reactors	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						uranium oxides; erbium burnable absorber; high-burnup; PWR type reactors; pressure tube reactors; proliferation resistance; fuel cycle		This paper is aimed at the development of a fuel cycle concept for host countries with a lack of nuclear infrastructure. To minimize plutonium proliferation concern the adoption of long-life core with no fuel radiochemical treatment on site is suggested. Current investigation relies upon Light water reactor technology and plutonium-free fresh fuel. Erbium doped to uranium oxide (enrichment 19.8%) fuel is selected as the reference. Such a high enrichment is selected in attempt to approach the longest irradiation time in one batch mode. In addition to that, uranium enriched up to 20% does not consider as a nuclear material for direct use in weapon manufacture. A sequence of two irradiation cycles for the same fuel rods in two different light water reactors is the key feature of the advocated approach. It is found that the synergism of PWR and pressure tube graphite reactor offers fuel burnup up to 140 GWd/tHM without compromising safety characteristics. Being as large as 8% in the final isotopic vector, fraction of Pu-238 serves as an inherent protective measure against plutonium proliferation.

In order to clarify the mechanisms involved in maintaining this high pH for long time, we investigated the dissolution phenomena of OPC hydrate. In the present research, leaching tests on powdered cement hydrates were conducted by changing the ratio of mass of leaching water to mass of OPC hydrate (liquid/solid ratio) from 10similar to2, 000 (wt/wt). Ordinary Portland Cement hydrate was contacted with deionized water and placed in a sealed bottle. After a predetermined period, the solid was separated from the solution. From the results of XRD analysis on the solid phase and the Ca concentration in the aqueous phase, it was confirmed that Ca(OH)(2) was preferentially dissolved when the liquid/solid ratio was 10 or 100 (wt/wt), and that C-S-H gel as well as Ca(OH)(2) were dissolved when the liquid/solid ratio was 500 (wt/wt) or larger. Si-29-NMR results showed that the silicate anion chain of the C-S-H gel became longer when the liquid/solid ratio was 500 (wt/wt) or greater. This indicates that leaching of OPC hydrate results in a structural change of C-S-H gel.

Under normal operation these elements are not released to the environment in significant amounts. There are accordingly very few areas or source terms where exotic transplutonium elements, such as curium isotopes, can be studied in the environment. The Chernobyl accident provided a complex spectrum of fission and activation products in fallout while the relative amounts, compared to the core inventory, of refractory elements such as transuranium and transplutonium elements were small. The major alpha-activity consisted of (242)Cm (T(1/2)=163 d) that would have decayed after a few years. In this study we have demonstrated the presence of so called "supported (242)Cm" from the long-lived (242)Am(m) (T(1/2)=141 a) in environmental samples, following fallout from the Chernobyl accident. It has also been possible to assess the core burn up by using the data obtained for the Cm isotopes. The curium isotopes (243)Cm (T(1/2)=29.1 a) and (244)Cm (T(1/2)=18.1 a) cannot be resolved by conventional alpha-spectrometry. The assessment of these isotopes in environmental samples contaminated from the Chernobyl accident has been made by studying the effective half-life of the mixture of the isotopes. The data are compared with those previously obtained by high-resolution alpha-spectrometry and spectral deconvolution.

Profiles of pore water U can be divided into two groups such as low (17+/-7 ng/l) and high concentration (69+/-30 ng/l). These values were 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than that of lake waters (6+/-4 ng/l) due to the release of U from the sediments by decomposition of organic materials. Variations in pore water U concentrations seem to relate to the differences in pore water pH, the association forms, and their contents of U in the lake sediments.

Three types of HPs were found by the analyses using alpha-track technique and scanning electron rnicroscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (SEM/EDX). The dissolution of HPs has been affected by the existing type of HPs. Six-stage sequential selective extraction procedure was carried out to define the chemical forms of uranium, Am-241 and Cs-137.

The isotope ratios were measured on three standards using a VG 54-30 thermal ionisation mass spectrometer in static mode with Faraday cup and Daly ion counting system. The use of a WARP (Wide Aperture Retardation Potential) energy filter improves abundance sensitivity by an order of magnitude over a conventional VG Sector TIMS. An abundance sensitivity of 28 ppb at mass 237 with respect to U-238 can be achieved. By correcting mass bias as a function of ion beam intensity, precision of the U-235/U-238 ratio was enhanced with a sample load of around 300 ng U. The resulting reproducibility for standards and soil samples was better than 0.2% at two standard deviations. Uranium isotopic compositions have been determined in soil samples and compared between Chernobyl nuclear accident site and the criticality accident, which occurred in Japan at the JCO site.

The maximum values of Cs-137 contamination and of gamma-ray dose rate were 39 kBq/m(2) and 0.033 muSv/h, respectively. The maximum alpha and beta gross counting rates on the surface of ground were 1 cpm and 182 cpm in active area of 72 cm(2), respectively. Activity of Pu-239,Pu-240 for soil was 80 Bq/kg in the top 5 cm and aerial deposition was 3.4 kBq/m(2) in Rongelap Island in 1999. The body burden of Cs-137 Was observed to be 27+/-11 Bq/kg for 6 workers. Assessment of external and internal annual doses (0.1 and 0.07 mSv/y) indicates that as of 1999 there is no large risk to the inhabitants of Rongelap Island from a radiological point of view. The radiological status of Rongelap Island, which was severely contaminated by the radiological fallouts of nuclear testings carried out in 1954, has improved year by year as shown by the decrease of Cs-137. The effective halftime of Cs-137, which is estimated to be 6.6 y is much shorter than the physical half-life of Cs-137. Radioactive contamination in Kaballe Island. (a part of the northern islands used for fanning) which is located 25 km northeast of Rongelap Island, was still high in 1999. One site nearby a beach was highly contaminated with Cs-137. where the maximum activity of Cs-137 was 3.4 MBq/m(2), alpha-ray of 2 cpm, beta-ray of 1205 cpm and gamma-ray of 0.73 muSv/h. Activity of Pu-239,Pu-240 in soil (n=1) was 294 Bq/kg (top 5 cm) and 16 kBq/m(2).

J	Singh, NP; Bertelli, L				Singh, NP; Bertelli, L			What is legally defensible and scientifically most accurate approach for estimating the intake of radionuclides in workers?	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Low-Level Measurements of Actinides in Biological and Environmental Samples	OCT 16-20, 2000	OARAI, JAPAN					This paper describes the merits and demerits of each technique utilized for determining the intakes of radioactive materials in workers with particular emphasis on the intake of thorium, uranium, and plutonium. Air monitoring at work places have certain flaws, which may give erroneous estimates of intake of the radionuclides. Bioassay techniques involve radiochemical determinations of radionuclides in biological samples such as urine, feces etc, and employing biokinetic models to estimate the intake from such measurements. Though, highly sensitive and accurate procedures are available for the determination of these radionuclides biokinetic models employed produce large errors in the estimate. In vivo measurements have fundamental problems of poor sensitivities. Also, due to non-availability of such facilities at most of the nuclear sites transporting workers at different facilities may cost a lot of financial resources. It seems difficult to defend in the court of law that determination of intake of radioactive material in workers by an individual procedure is accurate; at the best these techniques may be employed to obtain only an estimate of intake.

To shorten the time required for the urine bioassay, a rapid method for plutonium analysis using the ICP-MS system was developed. In this chemical procedure, a microwave oven was applied for sample digestion, and an extraction chromatography resin was used for the separation of plutonium. The measurement time was extremely reduced by application of the ICP-MS as compared to alpha-spectrometry. The total analysis time was about 12 hours and the detection limit was 0.3 mBq/sample. The short analysis time and the low detection limit indicate that this method is useful not only for special monitoring but also for routine monitoring.

A median value of surface Pu-239,Pu-240 in the Sea of Japan in this period was 5.6 mBq/m(3) with the range between 2.1 and 14.0 mBq/m(3), which is slightly higher than that in the western North Pacific. The vertical distribution of Pu-239,Pu-240 showed a surface minimum. a subsurface maximum and gradual decrease with increasing depth. The Pu-241/Pu-239,Pu-240 activity ratios in water columns were almost constant except for surface water. In regard to Pu-239,Pu-240 in surface water of the Sea of Japan, these findings suggest that rapid recycling of deeper plutonium occurs in the Sea of Japan due to deep convection in winter and biogeochemical processes such as particle scavenging and remineralization.

This paper describes biokinetic studies of plutonium nitrate and gadolinium oxide in human volunteers and rats. The results, together with information from other studies with radionuclides, suggests that animal studies can be used with advantage for assessing the biokinetic behavior in humans, and for providing guidance on the assessment of intake and optimal monitoring regimens.

Most of contamination was recovered during the cleanup program. However, some of the plutonium still remains in the bottom sediments of the area. In 1997 an international expedition with a comprehensive sampling program was performed. A lot of sediment samples were taken with a Finnish Gemini corer. Sediment samples from 5 sampling stations, 80 samples altogether, were pretreated in Riso, Denmark, and analysed for transuranic elements at STUK Finland. The samples were analysed primarily for Pu, but gamma-spectrometric measurements of Am-241 were also made. Generally, the Pu concentrations in the area studied were from 1 to 3 magnitudes higher than the fallout level in the Arctic sea area. None of the vertical profiles of Pu at the various stations showed a typical Pu peak originating from the accident in 1968, but the sediments were mixed down and contaminated to the depths studied (20 cm). The presence of large quantities of hot particles distorted the estimations of mean concentrations and inventories. Samples with plutonium from the accident show significant variations of nuclide ratios, Pu-238/Pu-239,Pu-240, Pu-241/Pu-239,Pu-240 and Pu-241/Am-241. This indicates that Pu at Thule may be from more than one source of different quality.

Firstly tritiated moisture together with all water vapor in air is adsorbed on Drierite after coagulation using an electric cooler. Then (CO2)-C-14 Plus stable CO2 in the dried air is adsorbed on molecular sieve 4A. Elemental tritium gas (HT) plus hydrogen gas (H-2) in the atmosphere along with H-2 gas generated from electrolysis of groundwater which does not contain any T, are oxidized on Pd catalyst to water and adsorbed on molecular sieve 3A. Tritiated methane (CH3T) and (CH4)-C-14 Plus stable methane in the atmosphere are oxidized on Pt catalyst to water and CO2 under 400 degreesC. Then, Drierite and molecular sieve 4A adsorb the oxidized T (HTO) and C-14 ((CO2)-C-14), respectively. Tritium and C-14 in surface and soil air have been measured using this system.

Continuous measurements of gamma-ray spectra have been established since April 1996. As a result, the contribution of various radionuclides has been gradually clarified in the variations of the gamma-ray dose rate. In this paper, the energy spectrum of the incident gamma-ray to NaI(Tl) scintillation detector was obtained by the unfolding method using a response matrix, and the variations of the energy spectrum observed in the precipitation and snow were investigated. The increase in the dose rate in precipitation originated from the increase in the flux density of gamma-ray from Bi-214 and Pb-214, daughter nuclide of Rn-222, which fell down with the precipitation. On the other hand, the reduction in the dose rate in the snowy period was confirmed due to the shielding effect of a part of gamma-rays from the natural radioactive nuclides by the snow layer, in coincidence with the decrease of the flux density in K-40 and Tl-208.

In the ICP-MS, a calibration curve method was conveniently utilized even in high viscosity solution using a Babington nebulizer. Plutonium concentrations in soil around the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power station were found to be in the range of 0.054 to 1.0 Bq/kg with an average of 0.27 Bq/kg. The ratios of Pu-239/Pu-240 were also obtained with the ICP-MS to investigate the origin of Pu-isotopes. On the basis of this result, the origin of the Pu-isotopes was attributed to be fallout from the past atmospheric nuclear tests.

The mean areal deposition of Cs-137 ranged from 1,500 to 4, 100 Bq/m(2). However, some hot spot-Like areas showing high concentrations of 5,500-7,700 Bq/m(2) were found at some sites within the city. The Pu-239,Pu-240 levels ranged from <50 to 510 Bq/m(2). however most of them ranged between 120-200 Bq/m(2). These levels are nearly the same as those around the Semipalatinsk City. At most of the sites within the city and its adjacent areas, both nuclides were found in the soil layers up to a depth of 30 cm. A fraction of 20-50% of Pu-239,Pu-240 was not leached by hot digestion with concentrated HNO3 containing a small amount of H2O2. Generally, such tightly bound fraction showed a trend to decrease with increasing distance from the SNTS. The fraction of these radionuclides that were deposited in Ust'-Kamenogorsk district from global and from SNTS fallouts have been determined using the Pu-240/Pu-239 atomic ratios in both Pu fractions: one which can be leached with hot HNO3 + H2O2 and another that is a non-leacheable for each soil layer of core samples. As a result a fraction of 21-80% (mostly 30-60%) of total 239, were found to be due to the local fallout of Pu from the SNTS debris.

Although the plutonium was detected in all samples collected in 1980's, the concentration is almost the same level as the detection limit (1 to 3 mBq/kg wet) in recent years. The atomic ratio of Pu-240/Pu-239 in all samples was slightly higher than the value of global fallout.

We compared chemical yield of uranium and plutonium from organic-rich Japanese soil and humic acid samples which were subjected to three different pretreatment procedures ((1) pulverization only. (2) dry-ashing at 510 degreesC after pulverization, and (3) 680 kGy gamma-ray irradiation after pulverization) prior to acid digestion. Separation of U and Pu was performed by U-TEVA resin and AGI-X8 anion exchange resin, respectively, For organic samples, pretreatment procedures governed the yield of actinide elements significantly. Chemical separation yield of U was low (6 +/- 1%) for Aldrich humic acid sample after dry-ashing at 510 degreesC. For such samples, gamma-ray irradiation improved the yield of U to 35 +/- 22%. Recovery of Pu was lower for some organic soil samples which were dry-ashed at 510 degreesC (27 +/- 2%) as compared to those which were not dry-ashed (62 +/- 10%).

The regional deposition of these nuclides in Finland has been assessed, based on samples of lichen, peat, precipitation, surface soil and grass. Unlike the deposition of transuranium elements from the weapons tests in the 1950's and the 1960's, the deposition in Finland from the Chernobyl accident was very unevenly distributed. Even then, the Chernobyl-derived deposition of Pu-230,Pu-240 in the most contaminated regions of Finland was only around 10% of the global fallout from weapons tests. The total amount of Pu-239,Pu-240 deposited in Finland was 1.10(11) Bq (approximate to 25 g), i.e., approximately half of a percent of the activity deposited in the 1950's and the 1960's. In addition to the alpha-emitting Pu isotopes, the Chernobyl plume also contained a significant amount of the beta-emitting Pu-241, which is the precursor of the long-lived alpha-emitter Am-241. The highest plutonium deposition values were found in a relatively narrow swath from the southwestern coast of Finland northeastwards across the country. This is related to the calculated route of the air parcel trajectory associated with the initial explosion of the Chernobyl reactor. The high deposition values found in the northeastern part of the plume route over Finland can be attributed to the simultaneous occurrence of precipitation. The relatively high plutonium deposition in the southwestern part of Finland occurred, however, without concurrent precipitation. This indicates that the plutonium was at least partly associated with relatively large particles having a substantial deposition velocity due to gravitational settling.

The flow injection system (PrepLab(TM)) was composed of two TEVA-Spec(R) resins, reduced remarkably the sample amounts and the analysis time, compared to the conventional analytical methods. In the flow injection system, Mo and Ru were sufficiently eliminated by using the flow injection system, with the decontamination factors of 1.6.10(4) and 9.9.10(5), respectively. With the present method, it was possible to determine ultra-low level of Tc-99 in 3-6 g soil at 3-5 hours of analysis time per sample. The relative standard deviation for each sample was less than 4%.

Soil samples have been collected at various places of Kotagiri taluk in Nilgiris biosphere and are analyzed for radioactivity measurements of primordial radionuclides by 3"x3"NaI(Tl) gamma-ray spectrometer. It is observed that the average activity of Th-232 series, U-238 series and K-40 in soil samples is found to be 102 Bq.kg(-1).41 Bq.kg(-1) and 229 Bq.kg(-1), respectively which contributes to a total gamma-dose of 86 nGy.h(-1). Results of this systematic investigation establish the existence of wide range of variation in 232Th Series, 238U series and 40K activities, which may he attributable to the existence of wide variety of lithological compounds in the zone under study. The ambient gamma-radiation dose measured is found to vary from 91 to 193 nGy.h(-1) with a mean of 142.8 nGy.h(-1). The measured ambient gamma-dose is more than 50% of the dose calculated from soil activities, which is due to the higher cosmic ray contribution to the total dose in the environment. The data is compared with different places around the world and the results are discussed in this paper.

The research reactor is currently, upgraded to 10 MWth of thermal power, while the cooling capacity, of the reactor was designed and constructed for 20 MWth. This reserve in the cooling capacity, serves redundancy, today, but can be used for future upgrading too. The core thermal hydraulic design was, therefore, done for the normal operation conditions so that fuel elements have enough safety, margins both against nucleate boiling anywhere in the reactor core. Thermal hydraulic performance was studied. It is shorn that the 36% enriched UAlx-Al fuel elements in WWR-SM fuel coolant channel do not allow to force zip the reactor power to 20 MWth. The study was carried out for an equilibrium core, with compact load (223 fuel assemblies) under normal operation conditions only, (steady state condition).

However, we have observed that even a basically stable compound such as NaCl may become unstable after heavy irradiation. As a result of the irradiation, dislocations, Na and Cl-2 precipitates and large voids are produced followed ultimately by sudden explosion-driven fracture of the material. We present a new concept of the radiation-induced micro-structural evolution, which explains the phenomena observed in heavily irradiated NaCl samples. This concept can be a prototype of a more general assessment of radiation effects in crystalline radwaste and repository materials. which is necessary for the evaluation of critical effects and maximization of the safety of repositories.

The angular distribution of conversion electrons emitted from Er-167m (T-1/2 = 2.27 s) was monitored with a position-sensitive detector following the room-temperature 60 keV implantation of the precursor isotope Tm-167 (T-1/2 = 9.25 d) to a dose of 2 x 10(12) at./cm(2). The results for the sample annealed in vacuum at 610 degreesC for 15 min provide direct evidence that Er occupies both Sr and Ti substitutional lattice sites. In addition, thermal recovery of lattice damage was also studied with Rutherford backscattering/channeling for SrTiO3 implanted to doses of 5 x 10(14) and 5 x 10(15) Er/cm(2). We further comment on preliminary photoluminescence results from these samples. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The damage evolution and recovery on both the Si and C sublattices were determined using a 0.94 MeV deuterium beam in ion channeling geometry by simultaneously measuring the scattering/reaction yield from Rutherford backscattering spectrometry combined with C-12(d,p)C-13 nuclear reaction analysis. The rate of damage evolution at 150 K is higher for 4H-SiC than for 6H-SiC. At low doses, the rate of C disordering is higher than that for Si, which is consistent with the lower displacement energy for C. Both 4H and 614 SiC exhibit only minor damage recovery below 300 K. Above 300 K damage recovery on the Si and C sublattices is similar for both 4H and 6H SiC. Three distinct recovery stages are observed on each sublattice in 4H-SiC, and at high doses, where a buried amorphous layer is produced, an additional recovery stage is observed above 800 K.

In this study we tried to inspect the supposition that the energy deposition of the electron beam to hydrogen caused the migration of hydrogen and gave rise to bubble formation and growth. We used hydrogen (H) or deuterium (D) as implanted ion to change the cross section of the reaction that D or H is given energy by electron beam. The energy deposition cross section in the case of H is 2-3 times as large as that in the case of D. Bubbles were less likely to be formed and grow in the case of D than in the case of H. This result can be explained in terms of the difference of the concentration of the mobile gas atom caused by the difference of the energy deposition cross section, and does not contradict the supposition.

In this paper, it is proposed that a large range of A(2)O(3)-BO2 oxide compositions, with structures related to the fluorite crystal structure, may exhibit exceptional resistance to radiation-induced amorphization. Results of heavy ion irradiations on selected A(2)O(3)-BO2 oxide compounds are presented in support of this prediction. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lian, J; Wang, LM; Lumpkin, GR; Ewing, RC				Lian, J; Wang, LM; Lumpkin, GR; Ewing, RC			Heavy ion irradiation effects of brannerite-type ceramics	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Radiation Effects in Insulators	SEP 03-07, 2001	LISBON, PORTUGAL			brannerite; pyrochlore; amorphization and radiation resistance	BEAM-INDUCED AMORPHIZATION; PYROCHLORE; ZIRCONOLITE	Brannerite, UTi2O6, occurs in polyphase Ti-based, crystalline ceramics that are under development for plutonium immobilization. In order to investigate radiation effects caused by a-decay events of Pu, a 1 MeV Kr+ irradiation on UTi2O6, ThTi2O6, CeTi2O6 and a more complex material, composed of Ca-containing brannerite and pyrochlore, was performed over a temperature range of 25-1020 K. The ion irradiation-induced crystalline-to-amorphous transformation was observed in all brannerite samples. The critical amorphization temperatures of the different brannerite compositions are: 970 K, UTi2O6; 990 K, ThTi2O6; 1020 K, CeTi2O6. The systematic increase in radiation resistance from Ce-, Th- to U-brannerite is related to the difference of mean atomic mass of A-site cation in the structure. As compared with the pyrochlore structure-type, brannerite phases are more susceptible to ion irradiation-induced amorphization. The effects of structure and chemical compositions on radiation resistance of brannerite-type and pyrochlore-type ceramics are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The structure and chemical state changes were investigated using an analytical TEM. After the H+ irradiation, CeO2 specimens showed changes in both the structure and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) spectra of O-K and Ce-M edges. Stacking faults with sizes from several nanometers to several tens of nanometers were observed in specimens it-radiated to a dose of 5 x 10(19) ions m(-2). The change in EELS spectra of O-K edge was much more obvious than that of Ce-M edge. Oxygen-related point defects are considered to be produced much more than those of cerium-related point defects in the H+ irradiated specimens. The difference in point defect production for oxygen-related ones and cerium-related ones are suggested to be an important factor to influence the evolution of both the structure changes and chemical state changes in the H+ irradiated CeO2.
