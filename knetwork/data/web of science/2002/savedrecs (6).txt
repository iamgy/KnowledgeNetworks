J	Ahluwalia, RK; Hua, TQ				Ahluwalia, RK; Hua, TQ			Electrotran sport of uranium from a liquid cadmium anode to a solid cathode	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						spent nuclear fuels; electrometallurgical technology; EBR-II		During anodic dissolution of irradiated binary Experimental Breeder Reactor-II fuel, a portion of the electrorefined uranium collects in the underlying cadmium pool. It is periodically recovered by setting up a cell configuration in which the pool is made the anode and uranium is electrodeposited on a solid cathode mandrel. A theoretical model is used to determine the current structure of the liquid cadmium anode. The model is validated by comparing against the measured composition of the cathode deposits. Multinodal simulations are conducted to explain the bell shape of deposits observed with this mode of electrotransport. The simulations also determine the dependence of collection efficiency on the electrical charge passed that is functionally consistent with the experimental data. Finally, a simplified operating map of the electrorefiner is presented that can be used to determine the conditions for growing cathode deposits of target composition.

To select proper ways and dates for the management of graphite, the information regarding the composition and level of the graphite contamination is required. In the paper, results are presented that were obtained in studies carried out at the I-1, EI-2, and ADE-3 reactors of the Siberian Group of Chemical Enterprises (Russia) in 1996-1999. The main feature of the studies is a wide-scale sampling from the graphite piles of the aforementioned reactors followed by complex assays of their radioactive contamination. The analyses performed for the large number of graphite samples made it possible to obtain a detailed picture of the pile contamination, to study radionuclide distributions over the piles, to construct schemes for evaluation of radionuclide stockpiles, and to evaluate stockpiles of several radionuclides including C-14, H-3, Sr-90, Am-241, Cm-244, Pu-238,Pu-239,Pu-240,Pu-241, Cs-137,Cs-134, and Co-60.

J	Tien, NC; Li, SH				Tien, NC; Li, SH			Transport of a two-member decay chain of radionuclides through a discrete fracture in a porous rock matrix in the presence of colloids	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						hydrodynamic chromatography; decay chain; external forces	CONTAMINANT TRANSPORT; HYDRODYNAMIC CHROMATOGRAPHY; SINGLE FRACTURE; PARALLEL FRACTURES; MEDIA; MIGRATION; DIFFUSION; SYSTEM; MODEL	Many physical and chemical processes dominate the transport of radionuclides in groundwater. Among these processes, the decay chain process of radionuclides was frequently disregarded in previous research. However, the daughter products may travel much farther than their parents along the fracture. Therefore, some models neglecting the effect of the decay chain may underestimate the transport radionuclide concentration in geological media. The transport of radionuclides in groundwater is also controlled by colloidal particles. The radionuclides may be enhanced or retarded by the colloids, according to the mobility of these colloidal particles. This work describes a novel model of the transport of a two-member decay chain of radionuclides through a discrete fracture in a porous rock matrix in the presence of colloids. The model addresses the following processes: (a) advective transport in the fracture, (b) mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion along the fracture, (c) molecular diffusion from the fracture to the rock matrix, (d) adsorption onto the fracture wall, (e) adsorption in the rock matrix, and (f) radioactive decay. Furthermore, colloids are assumed to be excluded from the matrix pores because of their size. A fully developed concentration profile system with nonreactive colloids is used to understand the effect of colloidal sizes by using hydrodynamic chromatography. The external forces acting on the colloid surface, such as the inertial, the van der Waals attractive force, the double layer force, and the gravitational force are accountedfor. The parameters, the average velocity of the colloid, the dispersion coefficient of the colloid, and the distribution coefficient of radionuclides with colloids are modified according to the colloidal size. The trans. port equations for the parent radionuclides are solved analytically using the Laplace transformation and inversion method. However, for the transformed solution of the daughter products along the fracture, the equations become very complicated in Laplace space. Accordingly, the solutions are obtained numerically by using Durbin's algorithms. The behaviors of colloids within the fracture are a function of their size, and they may affect the transport of radionuclides because of the large radionuclide adsorption surface of colloids. Thus, various colloid radii are considered to elucidate this size effect.

J	Zagar, T; Ravnik, M				Zagar, T; Ravnik, M			Determination of long-lived neutron activation products in reactor shielding concrete samples	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						TRIGA reactor; biological shield; concrete activation analysis	RADIOACTIVITY; CYCLOTRON	The results of activation studies of TRIGA research reactor concrete shielding are given. Samples made of ordinary and barytes concrete were irradiated in the reactor to simulate neutron activation in the shielding concrete. Long-lived neutron-induced gamma-ray-emitting radioactive nuclides were measured in the samples with a high-purity germanium detector. The most active long-lived radioactive nuclides in the ordinary concrete samples were found to be Co-60 and Eu-152. In the barytes concrete samples, the most active long-lived radioactive nuclides were Co-60, Ba-133, and Eu-152. Activation in the concrete was also calculated using the ORIGEN2 code and compared to experimental results. Simple radioactive nuclide generation and depletion calculation using one-group cross-section libraries provided together with the ORIGEN2 code did not give conservative results. Significant discrepancies were observed for some nuclides. For accurate long-lived radioactive nuclide generation in reactor shielding, material-specific cross-section libraries should be generated and verified by measurement.

Detailed information-on the neutral components (gamma-quanta, neutrons) of background radiation was obtained during the Grif-1 experiment onboard Mir orbital station (OS). The measurements of fluxes of 0.05-50 MeV gamma-quanta and > 30 MeV neutrons with a large area instrument (similar to250 cm(2) for gamma-quanta, similar to30cm(2) for neutrons) as well as corresponding charged particle measurements (0.04-1.5 MeV electrons, 1-200 MeV protons) were made during this experiment. The background components induced by the station's own radiation as well as the albedo gamma-rays from the Earth's atmosphere were revealed as the result of data analysis for about 600 h of observation. A mathematical model describing the latitude and energy dependences of atmospheric albedo gamma-rays as well as of those of gamma-quanta produced in the material of the station due to cosmic ray interactions was developed. An analytical approximation of the spectrum of induced gamma-rays from radioactive isotopes stored in the station and instrument's materials is presented. The dynamics of gamma-quantum background fluxes during the geomagnetic disturbances of January 10-11, 1997 are discussed. An analytical representation of the latitude dependence of the integral flux of neutrons with > 30 MeV is given. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

This method accounts for differences in densities, composition and counting geometries between real and calibration samples. Self-absorption corrections can be easily determined from a single spectral measurement knowing only the apparent densities of the samples. We have evaluated the influence of background parameters in the response of the spectrometric system and moreover, we have calculated the minimum detectable activity due to background contribution.

The harmonic mean of the count rates square roots measured with the two detectors was found to be independent of the hot spot position and depends only on the source activity, the box size and the gamma-rays energy. The activity of the radioactive point source can be calculated from the above-mentioned mean. The position of the point source can be calculated from the ratio of the two detectors count rates.

The merit did not overcome these deficiencies except in limited applications. We developed a low background phoswich counter (the well-type phoswich Counter) for the Hard X-ray Detector of the Astro-E project based on GSO scintillator. In the developmental work, we have succeeded in improving the light yield of GSO(Ce) by 40-50%. For energies above 500 keV, a large GSO(Ce) crystal (4.5 cm (.) 4.5phi cm) now gives energy resolution comparable to or better than the best NaI(Tl) when read out with a phototube. With a small GSO(Ce) crystal (5 x 5 x 5 mm(3)) and a photodiode, an energy resolution comparable to or better than the best CsI(Tl) has been obtained. With this improved performance, we find that the much higher photopeak efficiency and the shorter scintillation decay time of GSO(Ce) offsets its higher cost for many applications. We summarize our past developmental work to decrease radioactive contamination and to increase light yield of GSO(Ce) for astronomical hard X-ray detection. Included also are measurements done after the unsuccessful launch of the Astro-E mission. The work is still continuing for the remake version of Astro-E Hard X-ray Detector.

The main characteristics of this detector are low weight, small volume low power and resistance to cosmic ray radiation over a long period of time. We describe a 3 cm diameter by 3 cm thick CdWO4 cylindrical scintillator coupled to a PMT as a GRS for the energy region 0.662-7.64 MeV. Its spectral performance and efficiency are compared to that of a CsI(Tl) scintillator 2.5 cm diameter by 6 cm thick coupled to a 28 mm x 28 mm PIN photodiode, The comparison is made experimentally using Cs-137, Co-60, 6.13 MeV gamma rays from a C-13(alpha, gamman)O-16* source, 7.64 MeV thermal neutron capture gamma rays emitted from iron bars using a Cf-252 neutron source, and natural radioactivity 1.46 MeV K-40 and 2.61 MeV Th-232 gamma rays. We use a Monte Carlo method to calculate the total peak efficiency of these detectors and the full energy, first and second escape peak efficiencies. The experimental and calculated results agree well. We investigated the usefulness of these detectors for a GRS on a Mars lander mission. Although both detectors meet desired specifications, it was found that CdWO4 has advantages over CsI(TI) being a more compact detector of higher efficiency, Using a shaping amplifier of 24 ms, CdWO4 spectrometer exhibited a 6.8% FWHM at 662 keV. At 6.13 MeV, CdWO4 detector possesses an intrinsic total and full energy peak efficiencies of 16.7% and 6.3%. respectively. These efficiencies are nearly a factor of 1.6 and 4 greater than the corresponding efficiencies of the CsI(Tl) detector. A proposed gamma ray spectroscopy system to be placed on a rover, consists of a central detector surrounded by a Compton suppressor shield, The central detector is a cylindrical CdWO4 detector and the Compton suppressor shield is made of segmented CdWO4, Coupled to PIN photodiodes. The shield also prevents thermal neutron activation of the central detector, (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B,V. All rights reserved.

The presence of H2O in the target moderates neutrons and leads to a higher absorption loss in the target than is necessary, D2O coolant in the small quantities required minimizes this effect. We have studied the possible improvement in IPNS beam fluxes that would result from changing the coolant from H2O to D2O and the inner reflector from graphite to beryllium. Neutron intensities were calculated for directions normal to the viewed surface of each moderator for four different cases of combinations of target coolant and reflector materials. The simulations reported here were performed using the MCNPX (version 2, 1.5) computer program. Our results show that substantial gains in neutron beam intensities can be achieved by appropriate combination of target coolant and reflector materials. The combination of DO coolant and beryllium inner and outer reflectors improves facility performance about 1.3 times. The purpose of this summary is to report Our simulation and to recommend to change target coolant and inner reflector materials based on Our simulation results, (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Ipek, O				Ipek, O			Investigation of the infinite medium integral neutronic data for incident fusion source neutrons	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							FISSION HYBRID REACTOR; BLANKET; FUEL; PERFORMANCE; COOLANTS; URANIUM; DESIGN	In the present work, the physical behavior of integral data in infinite medium has been evaluated for incident fusion neutrons with the help to the 3-D Monte Carlo code. In a fusion reactor blanket with finite dimension, the integral quantities will be more or less different from the infinitive medium results, depending on the neutron leakage fraction. Design studies foresee the reduction of the neutron leakage out of the blanket as possible in order to prevent the nuclear heating in super conducting fusion magnets and to keep all neutrons primarily in the coolant. The most important materials in fusion technology, namely tritium, beryllium, lead, thorium, and uranium have been investigated in infinitive medium. The main purpose of this work is to calculate the integral tritium breeding ratio, U-233 breeding rate, Pu-239 breeding rate, heat release, neutron multiplication ratio through (n,x) and fission (when applicable) reactions in those mixtures which are composed when first UO2 and ThO2 are mixed with natural lithium (Nat.Li) or Li-6 for a volume fraction from 0 to 100%. Then the variable UO2-Nat.Li (UO2 mixed with Nat.Li) and UO2-Li-6 (UO2 mixed with Li-6) compositions will be mixed with Beryllium (Be) and Lead (Pb) for a volume fraction from 0 to 100%. However, the variable TO2-Nat.Li (ThO2 mixed with Nat.Li) and ThO2-Li-6 (ThO2 mixed with Li-6) compositions will be mixed with Be and Pb for a volume fraction mentioned above.

The heat generation rate produced from photons emitted from different geometry radioactive sources penetrating single layer concrete of various mean free paths (mfps) is also determined. In particular the heat generation rate is calculated for 6.20 MeV photons emitted from N-16 pipe and disc geometries source and a comparison has been made in order to estimate the percentage of energy captured, and therefore saved, inside the concrete shielding layer.

These experiments were performed at Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories in the early 1970s. HELIOS is an advanced lattice physics code based on two-dimensional (2D) high order transport theory with complete geometric flexibility. The 30 cases have been analyzed already with HELIOS as single pin cell cases and these results are used for comparison. The present study involves the development of the HELIOS input decks for complete 2D representations of the estimated critical cores. The sensitivity of the calculated values of k(eff) for various options such as reflector thickness, energy groups, coupling order and the modeling approach used in this analysis are discussed for selected cases. Finally, the results of HELIOS have been verified by comparison with the experimental results. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Sahin, S; Sahin, HM; Yildiz, K				Sahin, S; Sahin, HM; Yildiz, K			Investigation of the effects of the resonance absorption in a fusion breeder blanket	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							SPENT FUEL; REACTOR	In generic neutronic studies of a fusion breeder, resonance absorption is mostly neglected. In this work, the effects of resonances on the neutronic parameters a fast and moderated fusion blanket are investigated. In the present case, a (D,T) fusion reactor acts as an external high energetic (14.1 MeV) neutron source. The fissile fuel zone, containing 10 rows in radial direction, covers the cylindrical fusion plasma chamber. The fissile fuel is natural UO2. Fissile zone is cooled (a) with pressurised helium gas for the fast blanket and (b) with light water for the moderated, each of them with a volume ratio of V-coolant/V-fuel=2 in the fissile zone. The study has shown that careful resonance self-shielding calculations are indispensable for neutronic studies of a moderated fusion blanket. On the other hand the omission of the resonance self-shielding in generic studies of a fast fusion blanket can be tolerated to some degree. Furthermore, a correct description of the fusion neutron source spectrum has great importance on neutronic parameters, along with the resonance self-shielding calculations.

J	Williams, MMR				Williams, MMR			The effect of random geometry on the time constant of a multiplying system	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								Methods developed in a series of earlier papers for calculating the probability distribution of the multiplication factor when reactor properties and geometry are randomised, are extended to the time decay constant. To illustrate the method, we choose a one-dimensional reactor with plate type fuel elements which can be analysed by the source-sink method. Two types of randomness are studied: (1) when the plates are fixed in position and their enrichments vary randomly and (2) when the plates have a fixed enrichment and their positions in the core vary randomly. We present the probability distribution P(w) for the time decay constant w for the different realisations, which are chosen by means of a random number generator. The mean value and variance are calculated for an N plate reactor where N takes the values, 1, 2, 5, 10. We also obtain the associated marginal probability P(w>0), i.e. the probability that the decay constant is positive and we have a supercritical system. Some exact analytical results are obtained for P(w) for some special cases and these are used to check the accuracy of the simulations as well as giving guidance on the expected forms for the more complex geometrical multiplying assemblies.

J	Jeong, CJ; Suk, HC				Jeong, CJ; Suk, HC			Assessment of core characteristics during transition from 37-element fuel to CANFLEX-NU fuel in CANDU 6	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								A transition from 37-element natural uranium fuel to CANFLEX-NU fuel has been modeled in a 1200-day time-dependent fuel management simulation for a CANDU 6 reactor. The simulation was divided into three parts. The pre-transition period extended from 0 to 300 FPD, in which the reactor was fuelled only with standard 37-element fuel bundles. In the transition period, refueling took place only with the CANFLEX-NU fuel bundle. The transition stage lasted from 300 to 920 FPD, at which point all of the 37-element fuel in the core had been replaced by CANFLEX-NU fuel bundle. In the post-transition phase, refueling continued with CANFLEX-NU fuel until 1200 FPD, to arrive at estimate of the equilibrium core characteristics with CANFLEX-NU fuel. Simulation results show that the CANFLEX-NU fuel bundle has a operational compatibility with the CANDU 6 reactor during the transition core, and also show that the transition core from 37-element natural uranium fuel to CANFLEX-NU can be operated without violating any license limit of the CANDU 6 reactor.

The natural radionuclide (U-238, Th-232, K-40) contents of rock samples at various locations in the North Tushki area were investigated using gamma-spectrometric analysis. Estimates of the measured radionuclide content have been made for the absorbed dose rate of gamma radiation. The equivalent radium (R-eq) and the external hazard index (H-ex) which resulted from the natural radionuclides in soil are also calculated and tabulated. The studied samples have been collected from various rock exposures in the North Tushki area. The distribution of major oxides, U and Th were studied. It is found that the enrichment and depletion of the major oxides are mainly due to the effect of hydrothermal alteration, which caused mobility of some major oxides, which increases some elements and decreases others. It is important to mention that the study area is far from the development region of the Tushki project and is only a local hazard. Therefore, additional regional studies of the Tushki Project area should be under taken to explore any unexpected environmental hazard due to the high concentration of the radioactive elements, which have been observed at its north boundary.

The concept for modifying the core to increase the irradiation volumes in the channels in the fuel part of the core is formulated. The modification is to be done in two stages. First, the reactivity losses due to an increase in the irradiation volumes must be compensated by increasing the uranium load in a fuel element without changing the dimensions and geometry of the element. At the second stage, a new fuel element based on weakly absorbing structural materials will be developed and the specific power release in the core will be increased.

JT-60U is a large tokamak upgraded from the original JT-60 in order to obtain high plasma current, large plasma volume, and highly elongated divertor configurations. All components inside the toroidal magnetic field coils, such as vacuum vessel, poloidal magnetic field coils, divertor, etc., were modified. Various technologies and ideas were introduced to develop these components; for example, a multi-arc double skin wall structure for the vacuum vessel and a functional poloidal magnetic field coil system with taps for obtaining various plasma configurations. Furthermore, boron-carbide coated carbon fiber composite (CFC) tiles were used as divertor tiles to reduce erosion of carbon-base tiles. Later, a semiclosed divertor with pumps, for which cryo-panels originally used for NBI units were converted, was installed in the replacement of the open divertor. These development and operational results provide data for future tokamaks. Major failures experienced in the long operational period of JT-60U, such as water leakage from the toroidal magnetic field coil, fracture of carbon tiles, and breakdown of a filter capacitor, are described. As a maintenance issue for tokamaks using deuterium fueling gas, a method for reducing radiation exposure of in-vessel workers is described.

Using these wall-conditioning methods, the high-power operation of JT-60U has been successfully carried out with the carbon-based first wall. The material behavior of the carbon-based first wall has been investigated, and important knowledge was obtained on mechanical engineering and plasma surface interactions. In order to understand the tritium behavior in JT-60U, tritium retention in the first wall and tritium exhausted through the pumping system were measured. These results yield useful information on the tritium behavior in a future DT fusion machine.

The beam power has been increased gradually through optimizing operation parameters of the ion sources and conquering many troubles in the ion source and power supplies caused by a high voltage break-down in the accelerator. However, some issues remain to be solved concerning the ion source for increasing further the beam power and the beam energy. The most serious issue of them is non-uniformity of source plasma in the arc chamber. Various countermeasures have been implemented to improve the non-uniformity. Some of those countermeasures have been found to be partially effective in reducing the non-uniformity of the source plasma, and as the result the ion source, so far, has accelerated negative-ion beams of 17.4A at 403keV with deuterium and 20A at 360keV with hydrogen against the goal of 22A at 500keV The neutral beam injection power into the plasma has reached 5.8MW at 400keV with deuterium. Further efforts to reach the target of 10MW at 500keV have been continued.

In 1991, the NBI system was modified to be able to handle deuterium beams as part of the JT-60 upgrade modification. After executing some research and developments, deuterium beams of 40 MW at 95 keV were injected in 1996.

Material and Method: We exposed 300 C57Bl/6J female mice, 3 weeks old, to 10 cGy year(-1) gamma-rays while 300 control mice lived In the same room. Irradiation was delivered continuously by thorium nitrate. We kept all the animals until natural death and performed autopsy. Results: No difference was observed in life-span (mean life-span +/- SE: 805.2 +/- 9.62 clays for controls and 815 +/- 9.57 days irradiated mice), weight curves or food intake. At autopsy, cancer was present in 40.9% of controls and 37 9% of irradiated mice. They were mainly represented by lymphomas (23.7 and 24.9%) and histiocytic sarcomas (12.6 and 8.7%, respectively, for controls and irradiated mice). Vascular diseases occurred in 24 1% of controls and 23% of irradiated mice. Infections were present at autopsy, in 14.1 and 12.3%, respectively, of controls and irradiated animals. No statistical difference was observed at the end of the experiment for cancer or non-cancer discases between the two groups. Conclusion: Continuous 10 cGy year(-1) gamma-irradiation had no adverse effect oil malignant or non-malignant diseases in this strain of mouse.

J	Crocombette, JP				Crocombette, JP			Ab initio energetics of some fission products (Kr, I, Cs, Sr and He) in uranium dioxide	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							SELF-DIFFUSION CONSTANTS; POINT-DEFECTS; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; ATOMS; UO2; PSEUDOPOTENTIALS; PRINCIPLES; STABILITY; BEHAVIOR; FUELS	A computational study of some fission products (FP) energetics in uranium dioxide is presented. Krypton, iodine, caesium, strontium and helium are considered. Calculations are made within the density functional theory in the local density approximation with the plane wave pseudopotential method. Three insertion sites are considered: the octahedral interstitial position and the oxygen and uranium substitution sites. The importance of atomic relaxations is estimated on the He and Kr cases. They prove quantitatively important but can be neglected to draw qualitative trends. For each fission product incorporation and solution energies are calculated. The obtained values of the solutions energies of the various FP are in good agreement with their experimental behaviour: Kr, Cs and I atoms are insoluble in uranium dioxide, Sr solubility depends on the stoichiometry of mania. He atoms are found to have little interaction with their environment in uranium doxide. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ebert, WL; Lewis, MA; Johnson, SG				Ebert, WL; Lewis, MA; Johnson, SG			The precision of product consistency tests conducted with a glass-bonded ceramic waste form	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article								The product consistency test (PCT) that is used for qualification of borosilicate high-level radioactive waste (HLW) glasses for disposal can be used for the same purpose in the qualification of the glass-bonded sodalite ceramic waste form (CWF). The CWF was developed to immobilize radioactive salt wastes generated during the electrometallurgical treatment of spent sodium-bonded nuclear fuels. An interlaboratory study was conducted to measure the precision of PCTs conducted with the CWF for comparison with the precision of PCTs conducted with HLW glasses. The six independent sets of triplicate PCT results generated in the study were used to calculate the intralaboratory and interlaboratory consistency based on the concentrations of At, B, Na, and Si in the test solutions. The results indicate that PCTs can be conducted as precisely with the CWF as with HLW glasses. For example, the values of the reproducibility standard deviation for At, B, Na, and Si were 1.36, 0.347, 3.40, and 2.97 mg/l for PCT with CWF. These values are within the range of values measured for borosilicate glasses, including reference HLW glasses. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Using a catalyst of 0.5 wt% Ru supported by activated carbon grains, we decomposed oxalic acid and hydrazine, simultaneously and efficiently, with a stoichiometric concentration of H2O2. The decomposition ratios were decreased by the deposition of oxides. But even if the simulated reducing agent solution with high concentrations of coexisting Fe and K ions, which negatively effect decomposition ratio, was decomposed, the decomposition ratios of oxalic acid and hydrazine were kept high during decomposition of the amount of reducing agent used in actual chemical decontamination. Additionally, we examined the deposition ratios of metal ions on the catalyst as metal oxides. These results indicated about 2% of the radioactive species which were removed by the chemical decontamination were deposited on the catalyst column. Fe-59 and Cr-51 were estimated to be about 90%, of the total deposited amount of radioactive species and about 60% of the, dose equivalent in the model calculation. But this problem should be easily, dealt with by using shielding.

The solids were prepared by mixing the alumina cement with Ca(OH)(2) and/or CaSO4-2H(2)O. Batch experiments were performed for iodine sorption onto the solid and iodine desorption from the solid that was obtained after a sorption experiment. In order to clarify the hydrates in the solids, X-ray diffraction measurement and scanning electron microscopic observation were adopted. The iodine sorption onto the solid proceeded to replace the OH- in 4CaO.Al2O3.13H(2)O by I- in solution to form the new hydrate, 3CaO.Al2O3.CaI2.12H(2)O.

Since the objective sample is massive and large, the system has a full opening toward the sample position. The characteristics and features of the system concerning Compton suppression and reduction of the background component due to natural radioactive source are estimated by the Monte Carlo simulations. The anti-Compton technique is shown to be quite advantageous for the reduction of the surrounding natural background radiation, as well as the suppression of the background for the higher energy photons.

Figures of merit related to the isotopic measurements were determined using non certified as well as certified materials provided by the New Brunswick Laboratory (NBL). The experimental results showed that repeatability is around 0.5% while reproducibility was calculated as 0.27%. Mass discrimination was determined as 0.03% per mass unit and the system linearity check over five orders of isotope ratios yielded a mass discrimination factor (K factor) of 1.0002+/-0.0081 (0.81%, 2s). The mean error of measurement obtained from six different certified reference materials was 0.77%.

Permeation rates of elements from feed solutions to distilled water as a receiving agent were determined by changing the HCl concentration in feed solutions. An increase in the transport was observed for most of the elements studied with increasing HCl concentration in the feed solutions. Among them, Fe, Zn, Se, Zr, Nb, Te, Hf and Re gave relatively high percentages of permeation from 4-12 mol.dm(-3) HCl feed solutions. The permeability coefficients of these elements were determined.

To assess the performance of the resin in column configuration, a multiple batch contact method was used to determine the equilibrium distribution coefficients (K-d) and percent removal for Cs-137 from highly alkaline waste solutions obtained from the Hanford Site. The equilibrium loading data were interpreted in terms of Freundlich and Dublin-Radushkevics (D-R) isotherms. The equations fit the experimental data remarkably well considering the complexity of the Hanford tank waste compositions. The mean energy of adsorption and total resin capacity were calculated. The mean free energy for adsorption of cesium from Hanford tanks was similar to9 kJ/mol. The total exchange capacity of the SuperLig(R) 644 resin ranged from 0.72 to 3.46 mmole/g resin, depending on the Hanford tank composition. The K-d results reveal that SuperLig(R) 644 resin in highly selective for cesium in the presence of relatively high concentrations of sodium and potassium salts.

Uranium is preconcentrated from filtered water samples by coprecipitation with iron(III) hydroxide at pH 9-10 using an ammonia solution and the precipitate is dissolved in HNO3 and mineralized with H2O2 and HF; uranium in biological samples is ashed at 600degreesC, leached with Na2CO3 solution and mineralised with HNO3, HF and H2O2; uranium in soil samples is fused with Na2CO3 and Na2O2 at 600degreesC and leached with HCl, HNO3 and HF. The mineralized or leaching solution in 2M HNO3 is passed through a Microthene-TOPO (tri-octyl-phosphine oxide) column; after washing, uranium is directly eluted into a cell with ammonium oxalate solution, electrodeposited on a stainless steel disk and measured by alpha-spectrometry. The lower limits of detection of the method is 0.37 Bq.kg(-1) (soil) and 0.22 mBq.l(-1) (water) for U-238 and U-234 and 0.038 Bq.kg(-1) (soil) and 0.022 mBq.l(-1) (water) for U-235 if 0.5 g of soil and 1 litre of water are analyzed. Five reference materials supplied by the IAEA have been analyzed and reliable results are obtained. Sample analyses show that, the U-238, U-234 and U-235 concentrations are in the ranges of 0.30-103, 0.49-135 and 0.02-4.82 mBq.l(-1) in waters, of 1.01-7.14, 0.85-7.69 and 0.04-0.32 Bq.kg(-1) in mosses and lichens, and of 25.6-53.1, 26.4-53.8 and 1.18-2.48 Bq.kg(-1) in sediments. The average uranium yields for waters, mosses, lichens and sediments are 74.5+/-9.0%, 80.5+/-8.3%, 77.8+/-4.9% and 89.4+/-9.7%, respectively.

J	Mishra, SP; Tiwari, D				Mishra, SP; Tiwari, D			Inorganic ion exchangers in radioactive waste management - Part XII: Removal behavior of stannic and zirconium phsophates for strontium	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							RADIOTRACER TECHNIQUE; ADSORPTION; OXIDE; MANGANESE; THORIUM; BARIUM; SR(II)	The removal behavior of stannic and zirconium phosphates was assessed for Sr(II) ions as a function of sorptive concentration, temperature and pH. It was observed that an increase of these parameters enhanced the removal of Sr(II) ions from aqueous solutions. First order uptake of Sr(II) followed the Freundlich adsorption isotherm for the entire range of sorptive concentration (10(-2) to 10(-8) mol.dm(-3)). The study of temperature dependence showed that the endothermic and irreversible type of uptake proceeds by an ion-exchange type mechanism.

The sludge collected from the tube sheet region was found to have adsorbed these radionuclides at the high temperature (230-240 degreesC) that prevailed in the SG. An attempt has been made to evaluate the quantity of activity retained in the various oxide phases that constitute the sludge and their mode of pick-up. The sludge was characterized by XRD and XPS, which showed the presence of various oxides of iron, copper and nickel along with the silicates of calcium, magnesium and aluminum. Gamma-spectrometry of the sludge confirmed the presence of Cs-137, Cs-134 and Co-60 to an extent of 7.6, 1.3 and 0.9 muCi/g of sludge, respectively. Selective dissolution in various EDTA based formulations and equilibration with nitric acid and magnesium chloride solutions helped to understand the quantity of activity adsorbed by various constituents of the sludge. It was concluded that a major portion of cesium was picked up by a reversible ion exchange process on various oxide constituents and about 10% by an irreversible specific adsorption process on insoluble silicates. Also, it was proved that Co-60 was specifically adsorbed over the oxides of iron and nickel.

In the case of HNO3 and HClO4 media, the distribution ratio (D) value first decreases and then increases, whereas from HCl medium it first decreases and then remains constant with increase in H+ ion concentration. At lower acidities, U(VI) was extracted as UO2(HA(2))(2) by an ion exchange mechanism, whereas at higher acidities as UO2(NO3)(2).2(H(2)A(2)) following a solvation mechanism. The D for U(VI) by cyanex-272, PC-88A and DEHPA at low acidities follows the order cyanex-272 > PC-88A > DEHPA. Also, cyanex-272 was found to extract U(VI) more efficiently than TBP at 2M HNO3, The effect of diluents on the extraction of U(VI) by cyanex-272 followed the order cyclohexane > n-dodecane > CCl4 > benzene. The loading of U(VI) into cyanex-272/n-dodecane from 2M HNO3 has shown that at saturation point, cyanex-272 was similar to78% loaded. No third phase was observed at the saturation level. The stripping of U(VI) from the loaded organic phase was not possible with water, it was poor with acetic acid and sodium acetate but quantitative with oxalic acid, ammonium carbonate and sodium carbonate.

J	El-Kamash, AM; El-Sayed, AA; Aly, HF				El-Kamash, AM; El-Sayed, AA; Aly, HF			Thermodynamics of uranium extraction from nitric acid solution by TBP loaded on inert supporting material	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PHOSPHATE; IONS; CHROMATOGRAPHY; LANTHANIDE	Thermodynamic investigation of the extraction of both uranium(VI) and uranium(IV) from nitric acid solutions using tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP) loaded on polyacrylic acid polymer (SM-7) as an inert supporting material has been done using batch technique. The effect of temperature on the equilibrium extraction values has been utilized to evaluate the change in standard thermodynamic quantities (viz. DeltaH, DeltaS, and DeltaG). The Freundlich isotherm was successfully applied to the extraction data of both metal ions. The Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) isotherm was found to be valid only in case of U(IV) extraction. Based on the D-R expression, the maximum extraction capacity of loaded TBP and the mean free energy of U(IV) extraction have been determined.

The dissolved uranium was determined by polarography and the anodic dissolution rates by the initial rate method. It was observed that the dissolution rate increases with the applied potential, but is independent of the HNO(3) Concentration, because it is a zero order reaction. A mechanism for the anodic reaction was proposed based on the adsorption theory.

PIXE was used to obtain an average elemental composition of these deposits. From the analysis of radiations from U-238, Th-232 and K-40 isotopes, the samples were found to contain U, Th and K in concentrations up to 130 ppm, 30 ppm and 2.5 wt%, respectively. PIXE showed the presence of a number of trace elements such as Ca, V, Cr, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Sr, Y and U in concentrations ranging from a few ppm. to several hundred ppm. The occurrence of these radioactive and non-radioactive elements are discussed for their geological significance in the phosphorite deposits.

Plastic scintillators and wavelength shifter bars were irradiated uniformly with gamma rays. Both were identical with those of the ZEUS uranium calorimeter The attenuation length of the scintillators was determined from bench tests of single scintillator tiles and from beam tests of the whole calorimeter After exposure to a dose of 10 kGy the attenuation length of the scintillators decreased by a factor of 2. The experimental results show that the irradiation of the nearly 2 m long wavelength shifter bars affects the calorimeter much more than the damage of the scintillators which were only 19 cm long. Damaged and undamaged sections of the calorimeter were scanned with a moving radioactive gamma source (Co-60). The results demonstrate that the Co-60 monitor system is a very precise tool to detect radiation damage in a sampling calorimeter. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
