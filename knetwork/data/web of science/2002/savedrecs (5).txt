J	Grover, V; Tyagi, AK				Grover, V; Tyagi, AK			Sub-solidus phase equilibria in the CeO2-ThO2-ZrO2 system	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							INERT MATRIX FUEL; PLUTONIUM FUELS; FABRICATION; REACTORS	The phase relations in the CeO2-ThO2-ZrO2 system have been established after slowly cooling the samples from 1400 C. Ceria has been used as a surrogate material in place of plutonia. The various phase boundaries were delineated by refining the powder XRD data. Thoria and ceria were shown to form an ideal solid solution in the complete homogeneity range. About 5 and 20 mol.% of zirconia can be dissolved, under the heating conditions used in the present investigations, in the lattice of thoria and ceria, respectively. In the ZrO2-Th0.5Ce0.5O2 system, 10 mol.% zirconia was found to get incorporated in the lattice of Th0.5Ce0.5O2. The (Th0.5Zr0.5)(1-x)CexO2 system shows the formation of single-phase solid solutions from x greater than or equal to 0.70. Thorium rich compositions in (Ce0.5Zr0.5)(1-x)ThxO2 system were also found to be cubic solid solution. In addition, a number of other phases like t-ZrO2, various two-phase and multi-phase regions could also be identified in this pseudo-ternary system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Two new quaternary phases Rb2Sr2U4O15 and Rb8Sr2U6O24 in the Rb-Sr-U-O system were synthesized by heating the respective oxides at 900 C in air. A pseudo-ternary phase diagram of Rb2O-SrO-UO3 was drawn using the new quaternary compounds, and various phase fields were established by X-ray powder diffraction analysis. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) data of Rb2Sr2U4O15 were indexed by a monoclinic system with cell parameters, a = 0.7875(4) nm, b = 1.3199(4) run, c = 0.6667(5) nm and beta = 104.93(8)degrees, whereas XRD data of Rb8Sr2U6O24 were indexed by a cubic cell with a = 0.8743(1) nm. The structure of Rb8Sr2U6O24 was derived from the powder data and structural parameters were refined by the Rietveld profile method. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Experimental	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							MODEL	The oxidation of UN powders was carried out in a spout-type fluidized-bed reactor in gas mixtures of oxygen and argon, and over the temperature range of 200-500 degreesC. The rate of the conversion from UN to U3O8 powders was measured using gas chromatography and found to be dependent on temperature, partial pressure of oxygen and gas flowrate. The solid reactants and products were analyzed using SEM and XRD. Based on the experimental results, the conversion process was explained by the crackling core model. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The onset of shrinkage occurs at around 300-100 degreesC lower in oxidizing atmospheres such as CO2, commercial N-2 and N-2 + 1000 ppm O-2 compared to that in reducing or inert atmospheres. Shrinkage behaviour of UO2 is almost identical in Ar, Ar-8%H2 and vacuum. The shrinkage in N2 + 1000 ppm O-2 begins at a lower temperature than that in the commercial N-2. The mechanism of sintering in the reducing, inert and vacuum atmospheres is explained by diffusion of uranium vacancies and that in the oxidizing atmospheres by cluster formation.

J	Haschke, JM; Oversby, VM				Haschke, JM; Oversby, VM			Plutonium chemistry: a synthesis of experimental data and a quantitative model for plutonium oxide solubility	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							SALT RESIDUES; HYDROUS OXIDE; WATER; CORROSION; DIOXIDE; PU(VI); GROUNDWATER; REDUCTION; URANIUM; OXYGEN	The chemistry of plutonium is important for assessing potential behavior of radioactive waste under conditions of geologic disposal. This paper reviews experimental data on dissolution of plutonium oxide solids, describes a hybrid kinetic-equilibrium model for predicting steady-state Pu. concentrations, and compares laboratory results with predicted Pu concentrations and oxidation-state distributions. The model is based on oxidation of PuO2 by water to produce PuO2+x, an oxide that can release Pu(V) to solution. Kinetic relationships between formation of PuO2+x, dissolution of Pu(V), disproportionation of Pu(V) to Pu(IV) and Pu(VI), and reduction of Pu(VI) are given and used in model calculations. Data from tests of pyrochemical salt wastes in brines are discussed and interpreted using the conceptual model. Essential data for quantitative modeling at conditions relevant to nuclear waste repositories are identified and laboratory experiments to determine rate constants for use in the model are discussed.

Soft shutdown procedures (i.e., plant shutdown with moderate coolant temperature reduction rate) used to be applied to,reduce crud radioactivity release from the fuel surface, but these are no longer used because of the need for shorter plant shutdown times. In order to apply other suitable countermeasures to reduce RHR dose rate, assessment of plant data, experiments on deposition of crud and ion species on carbon steel, and mass balance evaluation of radioactive corrosion products based on plant and laboratory data were carried out and the following findings were made. (1) Deposits of ion species on carbon steel surfaces of the RHR piping was much more numerous than for crud. (2) Ion species accumulation behavior on RHR piping, which is temperature dependent, can be evaluated with the calculation model used for the dehydration reaction of corrosion products generated during the wet lay-up period. (3) Deposition amounts could be reduced to 1/2.5 when the starting RHR system operation temperature was lowered from 155degreesC to 120degreesC.

It was thought that radioactivity deposits on the RHR piping were mainly from radioactive ion species in the coolant and they were enhanced by the dehydration reaction of corrosion products on the piping. From an evaluation for temperature dependence of the dehydration reaction, it was proposed to lower the start-up temperature of RHR operation as a way to reduce radioactivity deposition. Feasibility studies of improved RHR operation were conducted and test operations were carried out in the Shika Nuclear Power Station Unit 1. Application of the improved RHR operation resulted in a temperature reduction from 150degreesC to 110degreesC, and a radioactivity deposition reduction on the RHR piping to one-fifth of that in conventional RHR operation. The improved RHR operation has now been applied to more than fifteen Japanese BWRs and significant suppression effects of radioactivity deposition have been observed.

Uranyl ion was adsorbed in an anion exchange resin and the rest metal cations, Fe(III), Al(III), Cr(III), Ni(II) and Cu(II) ions, were adsorbed in a cation exchange resin in this system. Desorption of uranyl ion and metal cations adsorbed in the resins were tested by 2 mol/dm(3) sulfuric acid solution. Desorbed elements were confirmed to be precipitated by appropriate alkaline solutions. On the basis of the results obtained, a concept was made on a decontamination system for uranium-contaminated waste solution from centrifuge enrichment plant.

In the food irradiation, an amount of 15,000 t of potatoes irradiated per year in Hokkaido was estimated to be worth 16M$. Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) used for combating losses due to the melon fly in the mainly Okinawa region produced as much as 70M$ in benefits. Production of rice using varieties developed by mutation breeding was about 3% of overall production in Japan and the economic scale was 774M$. Radioisotope (RI) utilized in laboratory work, environmental analysis and chronology was accounted to be as high as 24M$. The relative ratios of radiation processing (136M$), mutation breeding (804M$) and RI utilization (24M$) were 14%, 83%, and 3%, respectively. The economic scale surveys in food irradiation and mutation breeding were extended to the United States of America (hereinafter abbreviated as U.S.A. or U.S.) for a direct comparison to the situation in Japan. As to maximum estimation, it amounted to be 3.2b$ (billion dollars) for food irradiation and 11.2b$ for mutation breeding. The economic scale for agriculture products within our scope was 14.5b$ for the U.S. and about 0.8b$ for Japan, implying that the former is larger in magnitude by a factor of about 18.

Bases of the 8- hydroxyquinoline family, diphosphineamine and tribenzylamine, salted by benzohydroxamic, benzylic or phthalic acid, are able to complex actinides in different oxidation states. As a result of the presence of the benzene rings, all the compounds are easily incorporated into active charcoal to obtain adsorbers with a highly specific surface. The adsorption behaviors of uranyl U( VI) ion, thorium( IV) and Eu( III) were studied by evaluating their distribution coefficients, K-d. Results show that all the prepared salts can adsorb the ions in the III and IV oxidation state from weak acid solutions, whereas uranyl ion is adsorbed mainly from weak basic solutions. The prepared compounds can be used successfully to absorb and concentrate actinides from nearly neutral solutions, such as natural waters. The 8- hydroxyquinoline salt of the benzylic anion showed the highest adsorption values and thus seems to be the most appropriate salt to use in the analysis of actinides in water.

Testing was performed with actual Hanford tank wastes of widely different compositions using two identical ion exchange columns connected in series each containing approximately 5.5- 6.5 ml of SuperLig(R) 644 resin. The ion exchange columns utilized the same resin material that was eluted between the column tests. This was done to demonstrate the performance of the SuperLig(R) 644 resin for cesium removal from waste samples of different compositions, determine the loading and elution profiles, and to validate design assumptions for full- scale column performances. Decontaminated product solutions generated at the same operating temperature and constant residence times (bed volumes per hour) exhibited the same chemical compositions as their feed samples. The compositions of eluate solutions were generally as expected with the exception of uranium and total organic carbon, which where concentrated by the resin. Development of a pretreatment method for the SuperLig(R) 644 resin has been critical to successful column operation with different waste solutions.

Batch contacts were performed to qualitatively evaluate the effects of increased nitric acid, sodium and potassium. An equilibrium isotherm was generated with simulated concentrated tank waste solutions and fit to the Langmuir equation. Additional batch contact experiments were performed to determine if mercury, plutonium and americium would sorb onto AMP- PAN. Dynamic sorption was evaluated in column tests employing 1.5 cm(3) columns operating at 5, 10 and 20 bed volumes of flow per hour. Results indicate, as expected, that dynamic cesium sorption capacity is reduced as the flowrate is increased. Calculated dynamic capacities for cesium were 22.5, 19.8 and 19.6 mg Cs/ g sorbent, for 5, 10 and 20 bed volume per hour flows, respectively. The thermal stability of loaded AMP- PAN was evaluated by performing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) on samples of AMP, PAN (polymer), and AMP- PAN. Results indicate that AMP- PAN is stable to 400degreesC, with less than a 10% loss of weight, which is at least partially due to loss of water of hydration. The evaluation of AMP- PAN indicates that it will effectively remove cesium from concentrated acidic tank waste solutions.

The extraction chromatographic isolation of neptunium by means of an Ln resin(R) resulted in high separation factors of neptunium from uranium and a nearly complete removal of other interfering nuclides. The chemical yield was determined through a Np-239 tracer, which was isolated from a Am-243 standard solution during the same separation. The detection limits of 50 mBq.ml(-1) were obtained by gamma-ray spectrometry, sufficiently low to meet the requirements of waste management.

Different precipitation conditions of AUC are studied. The solubility of AUC as a function of uranium concentration in the feed at different temperatures using ammonium carbonate salt as precipitant is studied. This study indicates that 95- 99.8% of uranium is recovered as AUC by precipitating 5- 125 g/ l of uranium with loss of uranium (250- 10 ppm) in the filtrate by adding ammonium carbonate salt. It is also observed that the solubility of AUC increased as the concentration of uranium decreased. Thermal decomposition is carried out by thermogravimetry/ differential thermal analysis (TG/ DTA) and evolved gas analysis- mass spectrometry (EGA- MS) to find out AUC decomposition and gases evolved during decomposition. Studies are also carried out to characterize AUC by using X- ray diffraction (XRD). The data show that AUC obtained by the above conditions is very much consistent with published information.

J	DeVol, TA; Ringberg, AH; Dewberry, RA				DeVol, TA; Ringberg, AH; Dewberry, RA			Isotopic analysis of plutonium using a combination of alpha and internal conversion electron spectroscopy	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							SPECTROMETRY; PARTICLE	A combination alpha and conversion electron spectrometer was developed to quantify Pu-239/Pu-240 and Pu-238/Am-241 isotopic ratios of plated sources. The spectrometer was constructed with a commercially available low noise passivated ion- implanted planar silicon (PIPS) detector that was cooled to 77 K with liquid nitrogen. The combination spectrometer was used to quantify alpha- particles, conversion electrons, gamma- rays and X- rays associated with the decay of various plutonium isotopes and Am-241. Two amplifiers operated in parallel with different gains allowed for simultaneous acquisition of the lower energy region (21- 60 keV) for internal conversion electrons, gamma- rays and X- rays, and the higher energy region (5050 keV- 5550 keV) for alpha- particles. Energy resolutions of 2.2 keV FWHM (full- width at half maximum) for the 38.7 keV M conversion electrons and 11.2 keV for the 5499.2 keV alpha- particles from Pu-238 were measured. The energy resolution combined with a spectral deconvolution method was sufficient to be able to quantify the radioactivity using the alpha- spectra as well as the electron spectra; however, quantification of the radioactivity using the internal conversion electron spectra was more problematic because of the presence of X- rays, gamma-rays, Compton scatter electrons and the number of electron peaks present. Deconvolution of the alpha- spectra yielded Pu-239 and Pu-240 activities (as % of total Pu activity), which differed from expected values by -3.0% to 5.4%. Deconvolution of an internal conversion electron spectrum of a high Pu-239 and low Am-241 activity sample yielded Pu-239 and Pu-240 activities, which differed by -17.1 and -35.5% relative to the alpha-measurements, respectively. Determination of the Pu activity using the electron spectra was more problematic in samples where the Am-241 activity dominated. Determination of Pu-238 and Am-241 activity by the electron spectroscopy data was also obtained and compared with the alpha-spectroscopy results. Theoretical investigation of the removal of Am-241 or use of a 400 eV electron spectrometer indicated that the internal conversion electron spectra could be used to determine the Pu-238, Pu-239, Pu-240/Am-241 (when present) activity with and without spectral deconvolution, respectively.

The maximum degree of bioleaching (42%) of the reduced uranium species to U( VI) has been attained for the ore-Lemna minor-alkaline carbonate solution system. The UO22+ ions amount accumulated in the plants is negligible as compared to the dissolved quantity, owing to the ionic competition between uranyl ions and the cations necessary to the mineral nutrition. The X- ray diffraction patterns prove that the uranium species in pyrochlore mineral are completely oxidized to U( VI), while thucolite is only partially turned into UO22+ ions, in the presence of living plants.

The effect of contact time between the solid phase and aqueous solution, pH and ionic strength on the UO22+ sorption in the absence and the presence of phosphate was investigated. The effect of contact time between the solid phase and aqueous solution, pH and ionic strength on the phosphate sorption was investigated too. The isotherms of UO22+ and phosphate sorption at different pH values were determined. It was found that as compared with the sorption in the absence of phosphate, the sorption of UO22+ on silica in the presence of phosphate is increased at low pH and decreased at high pH; the abruptly increased with increasing pH in the pH range 3- 6; the sorption is gradually decreased with increasing pH in the pH range 2-12; the sorption insensitive and the sorption of phosphate is sensitive to ionic strength.

J	Murali, MS; Mathur, JN				Murali, MS; Mathur, JN			Sorption characteristics of Am(III), Sr(II) and Cs(I) on bentonite and granite	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							STRONTIUM; CESIUM; COMPLEXATION; HYDROLYSIS; BACKFILL	The ability of the back-fill and the host rock materials to take up radioisotopes like Am-241, Sr-85,Sr-89 and Cs-137 has been examined as a function of contact time, pH, amount of sorbent, sorbate concentration, and the presence of complementary cations. A batch technique using actual borehole water from the granite formation has been utilized. In general, the uptake of nuclides by bentonite is much higher than that with granite. The sorption order of nuclides on bentonite is Am> Cs> Sr. The presence of complementary cations, Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ depresses the sorption of Cs and Sr on bentonite. The sorption data have been interpreted in terms of Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm equations. Utilizing the Langmuir isotherm equation, the monolayer capacity, V-m, and the binding constant, K, have been evaluated. The change in free energy for the sorption of nuclides on bentonite has also been calculated.

A significant sorption of technetium on pyrrhotine was observed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and the sorption on the mineral was supposed to be due to the reduction of TcO4- to insoluble TcO2.nH(2)O. Sorbed technetium on the mineral could be desorbed by diluted sulfuric acid. The maximum desorption ratio under aerobic conditions was much higher than that of under anaerobic conditions, meanwhile, the desorption rates under anaerobic conditions were higher than that of under aerobic conditions in the initial stage of the experiments.

The effect of contact time, pH, particle size of the solid phase, and the concentration of a concurrent element Ca, were studied. The results show that more than 98% of the actinide elements and europium are adsorbed by the solid phase under all conditions. The fission products Cs and Sr have different behaviors, depending on the experiment conditions. The behavior of Ra is closer to the actinides than to the fission products. There are small differences between the behaviors of the actinide elements, which can be interpreted by migration mechanism from the aqueous to the solid phase, i.e., adsorption or precipitation.

J	Li, WJ; Tao, ZY				Li, WJ; Tao, ZY			Comparative study on Th(IV) sorption on alumina and silica from aqueous solutions	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							AMORPHOUS SILICA; ADSORPTION; THORIUM; DESORPTION; SOLUBILITY; OXIDES; AL2O3; YB	The effects of pH, ionic strength and concentration on the sorption of Th(IV) on alumina and silica were investigated and the sorption isotherms of Th(IV) on alumina and silica at different pH values were determined. It was found for both sorbents that the absorbability of silica is less than that of alumina. The relative sorption rate of silica is similar to that of alumina. The sorption edges are similar to each other, and the insensitivity of sorption to ionic strength is about the same. These similarities between the sorbents suggest that the speciation of Th( IV) in aqueous solutions plays a significant, but subtle role, in controlling the sorption process, because the charges of both sorbents are distinctly different. The mechanism of Th( IV) sorption on alumina is distinctly different from that of the sorptions of Cs+, Eu3+ and Yb3+ on alumina, and similar to that of the sorption of Co(II) on alumina.

However, the timing of such work requires careful consideration and, in a world where political issues dominate, there may be a danger that safety and business drivers are ignored. To develop the strategy for D&D, several factors have to be considered and addressed. No one factor should form the sole justification for the approach to be adopted. Safety in all its forms must be the primary consideration, but the strategy must take account of all relevant factors. Part of the strategy decision process should be to consider whether short- or long-term deferral is a sensible option. This paper (presented in 2001, prior to the formation of the Liabilities Management Unit) looks at the benefits and drawbacks in terms of safety, impact on the environment, and overall costs.

J	Ryan, TP				Ryan, TP			Implementation of the OSPAR strategy with regard to radioactive substances - an Irish perspective	NUCLEAR ENERGY-JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH NUCLEAR ENERGY SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	NEDCON 2002 Conference	APR 25-26, 2002	OXFORD, ENGLAND	NEDCON		OSPAR; discharges		In July 1998 at Sintra, Portugal, the Contracting Parties to the OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic adopted a strategy for the purposes of directing the future work of the OSPAR Commission with regard to radioactive substances. The objective of the strategy is to prevent pollution of the maritime area from ionising radiation through progressive and substantial reductions of discharges, emissions and losses of radioactive substances, with the ultimate aim of attaining concentrations in the environment near background values for naturally occurring radioactive substances and close to zero for artificial radioactive substances. Ireland is currently in the process of finalising its national plan for the implementation of the Strategy which is due for submission to the OSPAR Commission by 1st July 2002. This paper sets out the regulatory framework and environmental monitoring arrangements with which Ireland will implement the strategy together with the concerns Ireland has with respect to monitoring the collective implementation of the strategy, transboundary issues and adherence to the precautionary principle.

J	Yang, YW; Luo, ZP; Jing, XQ; Wu, ZX				Yang, YW; Luo, ZP; Jing, XQ; Wu, ZX			Fuel management of the HTR-10 including the equilibrium state and the running-in phase	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								The mode of fuel management of the HTR-10 was studied, including the simulation of the fuel shuffling process and the measurement of the burnup, of a fuel element. The prior consideration was the design of the equilibrium state. Based on this the fuel loading of the initial core and the fuel shuffling mode from the initial core through the running-in phase into the equilibrium state were studied. The code system VSOP was used for the physical layout of the HTR-10 at the equilibrium state and in the running-in phase. For the equilibrium state, in order to lessen the difference between the peak and the average burnup, 5-fuel-passage-through-the-core was chosen for the fuel management. The average burnup of the spent fuel for the equilibrium core is 80 000 MWd t (-1), and the peak value of it is less than 100 000 MWd t (-1) when the burnup of the recycled fuel element is under 72 000 MWd t (-1). The mixture of fuel element and graphite element was used for the initial core loading, the volume fractions of the fuel and the graphite elements were 0.57 and 0.43, respectively. During the running-in phase, the volume fraction of graphite will decrease with the fresh fuel elements being loaded from the top of the core and the graphite elements discharged from the bottom of the core. The fuel shuffling mode is similar to that of the equilibrium state. The burnup limit of recycled fuel element is also 72 000 MWd t - 1 and the peak burnup is less than 100 000 MWd t (-1). Finally the core will be full of fuel elements with a certain profile of burnup and reaches the equilibrium state. According to the characteristics of the pebble-bed high temperature gas-cooled reactor, a calibrating method of concentration of (CS)-C-137 was proposed for the measurement of fuel burnup.

J	Gao, ZY; Shi, L				Gao, ZY; Shi, L			Thermal hydraulic transient analysis of the HTR-10	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								The HTR-10 is the first high temperature gas-cooled test module reactor built in China. In the accident analysis, typical design basis accident and beyond design basis accident (BDBA), including the reactivity accident, the loss of external power ATWS, the air ingress accident and water ingress accident into the primary system are selected and detailed analyzed. The results show that the HTR-10 has inherent safety properties. The maximum fuel element temperature will not exceed the limit value 1230 degreesC. The total amount of graphite corrosion maintains no more than 320 kg, the exposure ratio of first coated particles is less than 2.4% in the BDBA. The released radioactivity is limited at a low level and the ability of fuel particles to retain fission products is not corrupted. Even the consequence of the severest hypothetical accident has no safety danger to the reactor. The reactor can shut itself down via its negative temperature coefficient of reactivity in heat-up conditions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, YZ; Cao, JZ				Liu, YZ; Cao, JZ			Fission product release and its environment impact for normal reactor operations and for relevant accidents	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								The radioactive concentration in the primary loop and the radioactive release for both normal operations and accidents for the HTR-10 are calculated and presented in the paper. The coated-particle fuel is used in the HTR-10, which has good performance of retaining fission products. Therefore the radioactive concentration in the primary loop of the HTR-10 is very low, and the amount of radioactive release to the environment is also very small for both normal operation and accident conditions. The radiation doses to the public caused by radioactive release for both normal operations and accidents are given in the paper. The results show that the maximum individual effective dose to the public due to the release of airborne radioactivity during normal operations is only 1.4 x 10 (-4) mSv a (-1), which is much lower than the dose limit (1 mSv a (-1)) stipulated by Chinese National Standard GB8703-86. For depressurization accident and water ingress accident, the maximum individual whole-body doses to man are only 7.7 x 10 (-2) and 2.0 x 10 (-1) mSv, thyroid doses only 1.7 x 10 (-1) and 1.1 mSv, respectively. They are much lower than the prescribed minimum of emergency intervention level (whole-body dose: 5 mSv, thyroid dose: 50 mSv) for sheltering measures stipulated by the Chinese Nuclear Safety Criterion HAD002/03. The conclusion is that the environmental impact is very small for normal operations and accidents for the HTR-10, and the requirements stipulated in the Chinese Nuclear Safety Criterions are satisfied perfectly.

The fabrication of the first fuel for the HTR-10 started in February 2000 at the Institute of Nuclear Energy Technology (INET), Tsinghua University. Up to September 2000, a total of 11721 spherical fuel elements were successfully produced. The average free uranium fraction of the first fuel-determined by the burn-leach method-was 5.0 x 10 (-5). So far, the release rate R/B of the fission gas, measured in the irradiation test, shows that not a single particle in three irradiated spherical fuel elements failed as the results of the irradiation test carried out in Russia. This paper describes the design parameter, the fabrication technology and the performance data of the HTR-10 first fuel, and the production and quality control experiences obtained from the manufacture of the first fuel for the HTR-10.

Photon metrology was carried out at energies ranging from 8 to 100 keV. Additional measurements were made using radioactive and fluorescent target sources. At -60degreesC, under full-area illumination, the FWHM energy resolution was 2.4 keV at 5.9 keV rising to 8.5 keV at 59.54 keV. Under pencil-beam illumination, the measured resolutions were generally less, being 2 keV FWHM at 8 keV rising approximately linearly to 5 keV at 100 keV. Analysis of the energy resolution function indicates that poor charge transport presently limit the performance of InP detectors and specifically hole trapping. This is borne out by the observed low-energy tailing of the pulse height spectra at intermediate and high energies. At very low count rates, it was found that the device was linear to within 1%. However, for count rates above similar to100 s(-1) and energies above similar to 50 keV, the detector began to display time variable gain shifts indicative of polarization effects. The spatial uniformity of the detector was investigated by raster scanning a 50 x 50 mum(2), 15 keV monoenergetic X-ray beam across the active area. Apart from a few localized areas, the detector response was found to be reasonably uniform at the 10% level, although inconsistent with that expected from counting statistics alone (2%).

In the present work, procedures are proposed to determine f experimentally by determining the track density distribution on an LR115 detector in a diffusion chamber. First, a relatively tall diffusion chamber, with a height of 8 cm, was chosen. After exposure, the LR115 detector was etched. A transparent template with concentric circles was devised to study the radial distribution of sensitivity using an optical microscope. The distributions according to different values of f were also calculated using Monte Carlo simulations. By minimizing the deviations between these Monte Carlo curves and the experimental data f was found to be 0.4. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Performances of the detection system based on a CCD camera and a converter screen have been recently improved using (LiF)-Li-6/ZnS:Ag scintillators with different thickness. Indeed, reducing the layer of the scintillator improved considerably the spatial resolution while keeping a reasonable efficiency. Furthermore, a neutron velocity selector was temporarily added to the setup to perform radiography and tomography experiments with monochromatic neutron beams. Basic properties of transmitted beams were studied to assess the applicability of this device in neutron imaging. Of interest was the enhancement of the L/D-ratio by selecting neutron beams of short wavelengths. Cold neutron tomography demonstrated to be a useful technique in various spheres of activity, such as aerospatial industry or radioactive waste storage. Various applications of the neutron velocity selector are described in the second part, namely, New features in cold neutron radiography and tomography-Part II: Applied energy-selective neutron radiography and tomography.

The method is based on the deuteron-induced nuclear reaction. The emission angle of the lighter product detected coincidentally with the heavier product is analyzed to deduce the depth distribution of the target atoms, while the conventional energy analysis is applied for impurities, the distributions of which are not of primary interest. Results of proof-of-principle experiments using the D(d, p)t reaction for a deuterated polyethylene (C2D4) film are described. The depth resolution is evaluated to be 0.66 +/- 0.07 mum, for 400 keV deuteron incidence in the C2D4 film. Factors limiting the resolution are discussed, and possible improvement even down to several tens of nm is concluded. The present method is applicable for microanalysis of some light elements other than deuterium contained in a film with thickness of several mum which cannot be reached by conventional heavy ion elastic recoil detection using MV accelerators. The method has another advantage that deterioration of the sample property, such as hydrogen isotope distribution, due to the probe beam irradiation can be minimized. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Walther, C; Bitea, C; Hauser, W; Kim, JI; Scherbaum, FJ				Walther, C; Bitea, C; Hauser, W; Kim, JI; Scherbaum, FJ			Laser induced breakdown detection for the assessment of colloid mediated radionuclide migration	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article							MULTIPHOTON IONIZATION; SOLUBILITY; PLUTONIUM(IV); HYDROLYSIS; HYDROXIDE; SYSTEMS; OXIDE; LIBD; SIZE	Colloids play an important role in the transport of pollutants in the environment. Harmful substances can undergo transport over large distances if bound to colloids in aqueous surrounding. One important example is the migration of Pu(IV) at unexpectedly high rates over several miles at a Nevada nuclear detonation test site. For long term safety assessments of radioactive waste repositories, it is hence crucial to know about the amount, size distribution and chemical composition of colloids in the ground water. Standard methods (e.g. light scattering) can be applied for high concentrations and large sizes of particles. Colloids smaller than 50 nm, however, are detected with very low efficiency. Laser induced breakdown detection (LIBD) can fill this gap. A new instrumentation is presented, which as compared to previous instruments, opens tip a much wider operational dynamic range, now covering three orders of magnitude in size (5-1000 nm) and seven orders of magnitude in particle concentration (1 ppt - several ppm). The technique is based on plasma formation on colloidal particles inside the focus of a pulsed laser. The plasma plume is detected by three-dimensional optical observations and by means of its shock wave with a piezo-detector. For mathematical modelling, detailed knowledge on the photon fluence distribution in the focal region is indispensable. For the first time a true Gaussian TEM00 mode has been achieved in the focus of a LIBD apparatus and great care has been taken to guarantee long-term stability of the optical parameters. Automated control of the laser pulse energy and beam shape is introduced to allow routine reproducible measurement. The apparatus combines acoustic detection with three-dimensional optical monitoring of the focal region with two CCD cameras placed perpendicular to each other in order to gain additional size information. The breakdown events are systematically characterized with respect to the number density and size of aquatic colloids as a function of the laser pulse energy. Whereas the threshold energy (irradiance) only depends on the colloid size, the breakdown probability at higher pulse energies is a direct function of the number density of colloids.

Results have been obtained on a polycrystalline sintered ceramics implanted with 3 MeV He-3(+) ions at a depth around 9 pin then annealed in air at temperatures between 200 and 400 degreesC. The activation energy for helium diffusion is around 1.1 eV. These data are in good agreement with literature data based on ERDA depth profiling of 27 keV He-4(+) ions implanted in natural (Durango) or synthetic fluorapatite single crystals.

The sputtering yields of SCO by 100 keV Ar+ and Ne+ are determined as 1.6 and 0.55 atoms per ion, respectively. The compositions remain nearly stoichiometric under ion irradiation. The experimental sputtering yields are compared with those of computer simulations based on the elastic-collision cascade and the surface-binding energies for sputtering, dependent on the simulation version, are deduced. These values are compared with those derived from the thermodynamic properties. The elastic collisions appear to be dominant. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	An, Z; Liu, MT				An, Z; Liu, MT			On the efficiency calibration of Si(Li) detector in the low-energy region using thick-target bremsstrahlung	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						efficiency calibration; bremsstrahlung; Si(Li) detector	RANGE 0.1-5 KEV; ELECTRON; ATOMS; MODEL	In this paper, the efficiency calibration of a Si(Li) detector in the low-energy region down to 0.58 keV has been performed using thick-carbon-target bremsstrahlung by 19 keV electron impact. The shape of the efficiency calibration curve was determined from the thick-carbon-target bremsstrahlung spectrum, and the absolute value for the efficiency calibration was obtained from the use of(241) Am radioactive standard source. The modified Wentzel's formula for thick-target bremsstrahlung was employed and it was also compared with the most recently developed theoretical model based upon the doubly differential cross-sections for bremsstrahlung of Kissel, Quarles and Pratt. In the present calculation of theoretical bremsstrahlung, the self-absorption correction and the convolution of detector's response function with the bremsstrahlung spectrum have simultaneously been taken into account. The accuracy for the efficiency calibration in the low-energy region with the method described here was estimated to be about 6%. Moreover, the self-absorption correction calculation based upon the prescription of Wolters et al. has also been presented as an analytical factor with the accuracy of similar to1%.

J	Carlsson, J; Wider, H				Carlsson, J; Wider, H			Emergency decay heat removal by reactor vessel auxiliary cooling system from an accelerator-driven system	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						accelerator-driven systems; reactor vessel auxiliary cooling system; emergency decay heat removal		The passive emergency decay heat removal during severe cooling accidents in Pb/Bi-cooled 80- and 250-MW(thermal) accelerator-driven system (ADS) designs was investigated with the computational fluid dynamics code STAR-CD. For the 80-MW(thermal) design, the calculations show that no structural problems occur as long as the accelerator proton beam is switched off immediately after accident initiation. A highly unlikely delay of beam stop by 30 min after a combined loss-of-heat-sink and loss-of-flow accident would lead to increased reactor vessel temperatures, which do not cause creep failure. By using a melt-rupture disk on the vacuum pipe of the accelerator proton beam to interrupt the beam at elevated temperatures in a passive manner, the grace time before beam stop is necessary is increased from 30 min to 6 It. An emergency decay heat removal design, which would prevent radioactive release to the atmosphere even more reliably than the Power Reactor Inherently Safe Module (PRISM) design, was also investigated. For an ADS of 250-MW(thermal) power with the same vessel as the 80-MW(thermal) ADS-examined, the maximum wall temperature reaches 745 K after an immediate beam stop. This does not cause any structural problems either. The grace time until a beam stop becomes necessary for the 250-MW(thermal) system was found to be similar to12 min. To reduce elevated vessel temperatures more rapidly after a beam stop, alternative cooling methods were investigated, for example, filling the gap between the reactor and the guard vessel with liquid metal and the simultaneous use of water spray cooling on the outside of the guard vessel. This decreases the coolant temperatures already within minutes after switching off the proton beam. The use of chimneys on the reactor vessel auxiliary cooling system, which increase the airflow rate lowers the maximum reactor vessel wall temperature only by similar to20 K. It can be concluded that the critical parameter for the emergency cooling of an ADS is the time delay in switching off the accelerator after accident initiation.
