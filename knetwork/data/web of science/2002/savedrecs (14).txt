Several tritium processing components from tritium operations of experimental and infrastructure facilities of TLK have reached the end of their useful lives, are no longer useable or are to be reconditioned for future use. These components are in the process of post-service examination to determine the condition of the working materials inside these components and the changes that have resulted from operation with hydrogen isotopes, predominantly tritium. Another important aspect is the preparation of some of these components, particularly metal hydride storage beds, for safe disposal. The results are of importance for the design, operation and particularly decommissioning of components of present and future tritium facilities and processing plants, such as JET and ITER. The activities are ongoing and the results to date are presented together with plans for future work.

Commercial Roots pumps on the market are not tritium compatible. They require one or more of the following modifications: i) replacement of elastomer O-rings by metal seals, ii) minimisation or elimination of leaks along the rotating shafts and iii) only use of tritium compatible materials. This paper presents the possible application of ferrofluidic seals to avoid gas flows between the pumping and the oil filled volumes. Tests were performed with ferrofluidic seals for different rotational shaft speeds up to 1500 rpm and for various pressure differences up to 100 kPa. The results with the ferrofluidic seal were very encouraging showing very small leak rates under Roots pump relevant conditions. To verify the performance of ferrofluidic seals under realistic conditions a tritium compatible Roots pump having a pumping speed of 250 m(3)/h and using ferrofluidic and metal seals is being constructed.

A significant proportion of this was retained in the machine and only released slowly over the succeeding operational and maintenance campaigns Tritium is also present though permeation and surface adsorption of materials. Means of detritiation of JET waste which could be applied within the facility are being developed. These must take into account the fall waste cycle including the generation of secondary waste and the possibility of recovery for re-use of tritium. Each of the typical JET tritiated waste streams is described and the detritiation processes being developed and under consideration are discussed.

The use of high gas pressure during fabrication is required so that the D-T gas rapidly diffuses into the pellet, which enables the fabrication facility to satisfy the power plant's fueling requirements. D-T gas mixtures at such high pressures raise safety concerns that must be addressed in the design. The combustion of D and T in air is discussed in this paper, as well as high pressure gas hazards and possible means to mitigate these hazards. The US Department of Energy guidance on tritium handling and storage is summarized here. Issues of safety and reliability of various protection systems are also discussed to support designers in tradeoff analyses of confinement types.

The approach settled the basic safety principles and approaches as the technical requirements on safety design and assessment derived from the safety characteristics of the ITER p ant It was concluded that prevention of accidents can be achieved sufficiently by means of ensuring and maintaining the structural integrity of the enclosures containing radioactive materials against anticipated loads during operation, and low hazard potential of radioactive materials contained can be maintained within prescribed limits sufficiently by the vented detritiation/filtering clean-up system (confinement system) even if large release is postulated. For embodiment of the safety design concepts to the ITER tritium facility, some practical considerations should be taken for the tritium containment barriers, e.g., limitation of tritium permeation and leak, provision of an appropriate ventilation/detritiation system for maintenance, those to ensure the mechanical integrity, etc.	Japan Atom Energy Res Inst, Dept ITER Project, Naka, Ibaraki 3110193, Japan	O'hira, S (reprint author), Japan Atom Energy Res Inst, Dept ITER Project, Naka Machi, Naka, Ibaraki 3110193, Japan.

Some data have been accumulated such as actual tritium behavior in the normal ventilated area and response of tritium monitors and emergency isolation valves. The experimental results of confinement of released tritium of about 3 GBq in 12m(3) of the Caisson under ventilation of 50 m(3)/h were consistent with those of simulation by a three dimensional eddy flow calculation code modified from FLOW-3D. Using this simulation code, the tritium confinement performance in large rooms can be demonstrated for actual fusion reactors.

The first plasma shot in the LHD was carried out in March, 1998, and since then, plasma confinement experiments have been performed. As a future plan, a DD plasma experiment, which is an experiment with deuterium (D) beam injection into D plasma, has been proposed by researchers. Conducting such an experiment is essential for the progress in magnetic fusion research. In DD plasma experiments, tritium and neutrons are generated as a result of nuclear fusion reaction. The maximum annual amount of tritium is about 370 GBq. We are planning to remove tritium with an efficiency greater than 99 %. We conducted a tritium safety analysis and found that for inhabitants around the LHD facility, the annual dose of exposure to tritium is less than 1x10(-7) mSv, which is a result of off gases and effluent liquid being released into the environment. However, to perform DD experiments, we need to obtain public consent, which is not easy. The National Research Institute for Fusion Science (NIFS) is open to the public, and we at the NITS make every effort to communicate to the public and the municipal governments information on radiation safety. The present report shows results of preliminary safety analysis and problems with obtaining public consent to future experiments of the LHD.

It has been reported that the system effect can be quantified by applying the serial reactor model to the piping system, connection of perfect mixed flow type reactors and plug flow type reactors, and that adsorption and isotope exchange reactions play the main roles in the trapping of tritium. In this study we made a calculation code of the system effect using the serial reactor model where 304SS, aluminum, copper or graphite is used for the piping material. Comparison of the calculated value using this code gives the good agreement with the experimental data taken at the cooperative experiment using a box made of stainless steel type 304 in Tritium Processing Laboratory in JAERI and that is called as the Caisson. It is observed that the isotope exchange reaction between tritiated water in the air and surface water on the 304SS surface controls the tritium trapping performance at the room temperature although HTO/HT ratio is around 0.1 in this experiment.

The experimental results showed that the polyimide membrane module could enrich significantly hydrogen isotopes and water vapor from nitrogen and dry air. It is concluded from these experimental results that using the membrane module could be useful for the real-time tritium monitoring.

In order to obtain data on tritium removal behavior from atmosphere in a room under the various conditions (humidity, ventilation flow rate), intentional tritium release experiments have been carried out with the Caisson Assembly for Tritium Safety Study (CATS) which consists of 12 m(3) gas-tight box (Caisson) for the study of tritium behavior in large space. Effect of adding water vapor has also investigated for effective removal. When the tritiated water existed in the released tritium, residual contamination on the wall of the Caisson was detected under the various ventilation flow rate and it was found that it depended on the initial humidity in the Caisson. On the other hand, when the water vapor was added into the Caisson after found the residual contamination, the residual contamination was removed quickly on the wall of the Caisson. The adding water vapor into the Caisson, it was effective for the tritium removal. Analytical work have also progressed and analyzed tritium removal behavior became to be in good agreement with the experimenta(1) results by considering the adsorption and desorption reaction rate of tritiated water on the wall.

Preliminary gamma-ray irradiation experiments of 4A molecular sieve with varying amounts of oxygen in the over-gas evoke a quenching mechanism. The data suggest that the gas phase rate constant for the production of hydrogen gas is several orders of magnitude smaller than the third order rate constant for scavenging of radical fragments by oxygen. For the production of hydrogen gas, the rate constant is calculated to be k(rx) = (19.6+/-4.5) sec(-1) under oxygen scavenging conditions.

Tritium was released immediately after,the samples were irradiated by the UV laser. An initial spike of tritium release was observed within 40 seconds for each of three types of TFTR D-T plasma facing components. Most of the decrease in surface tritium concentration occurred in the first minute of UV laser irradiation. In a second experiment, the UV laser was focused to irradiate the deposited layers on JT-60 graphite tile that had experienced hydrogen plasma operation. The effective absorption coefficient and the ablation threshold for the JT-60 codeposits; irradiated by the UV laser were determined to be 1.9 mum(-1) and 1.0 J/cm(2), respectively. An erosion rate of 1.1 mum/pulse was reached at a laser energy density of 7.6 J/cm(2).

Detritiation could allow easier procedures since the practices in different countries already limit tritium contents and releases for disposal in nuclear waste storage. The experience developed in steel-making processes, for liquid steel degassing by gas injection, has been applied for modeling of tritium removal. A numerical model, initially developed at IRSID (USINOR's Process Research Center) for hydrogen removal, is adapted to determine detritiation efficiency. The hydrogen isotope transfer between liquid metal and injected gas occurs in two elementary steps, liquid phase mass transfer and interfacial reaction driven by Sievert's law for H-2 and T-2. In the gas phase, H-2 and T-2 react to give HT, according to the thermodynamic equilibrium and the isotopic exchange, The model takes into account the change in bubbles swarms (sizes and velocities) as they ascent from the bottom of the vessel to the metal free surface. It is thus possible to predict the tritium content evolution during the treatment as a function of process parameters. Duration and inlet gas mixture, which have the major influence on detritiation efficiency, must be set according to the tritium initial concentration and the activity expected in the final waste.

The Oxidative Tritium Decontamination System (OTDS) reacts gaseous state ozone (accelerated by presence of catalyst), with tritium entrained/deposited on the surface of components (stainless steel, copper, plastics, ceramics, etc.) for the purpose of activity reduction by means of oxidation-reduction chemistry.(1) In addition to removing surface and near surface tritium contamination from (high monetary value) components for re-use in non-tritium environments, the OTDS has the capability of removing tritium from the surfaces of expendable items, which can then be disposed of in a less expensive fashion. The OTDS can be operated in a batch mode by which up to approximately 20kg of tritium contaminated (expendable) items can be processed and decontaminated to levels permissible for free release (< 16.66Bq/100cm(2)). This paper will discuss the OTDS process, the level of tritium surface contamination removed from various materials, and a technique for "deep scrubbing" tritium from subsurface layers.

A continuous wave neodymium laser, of power up to 300 watts, was used to heat the surface of the tiles. The beam was focussed to an intensity, typically 8 kW/cm(2), and rapidly scanned over the tile surface by galvanometer driven scanning mirrors. Under the laser irradiation, the surface temperature increased dramatically, and temperatures up to 2,300 degreesC were recorded by an optical pyrometer. Tritium was released and circulated in a closed loop system to an ionization chamber that measured the tritium concentration. Most of the tritium (up to 84%) could be released by the laser scan. This technique appears promising for tritium removal in a next step DT device as it avoids oxidation, the associated deconditioning of the plasma facing surfaces, and the expense of processing large quantities of tritium oxide. Some engineering aspects of the implementation of this method in a next step fusion device will be discussed.

It was found that metallic oxidized layer (Fe3O4 coated on S45C, slightly rusted SS400, rusted Cu of electric connector of the AC servomotor) adsorbs larger amount of tritiated moisture. Grease lubricant was highly contaminated in proportion to the exposed surface area of the pasted layer. Cable jacket (cross-linked polyethylene) was also highly contaminated in spite of hydrophobicity. This is probably because the jacket contains the filler "white carbon (SiO2.nH(2)O)" which adsorbs large amount of moisture.

The specimen was exposed to tritium at 523 K for 3 hours. The tritium inventory was in a range from 2 to 12 MBq. The desorption at elevated temperatures was measured by using a liquid scintillation counter. In addition, the tritium depth profiles in the specimen were evaluated by beta-ray induced X-ray spectrometry. It was found that the decontamination efficiency was enhanced by the presence of moisture. This effect was ascribed to the isotope exchange reaction on the surface. The depth profile measurements revealed the presence of tritium-rich subsurface layer and the bulk with lower tritium concentration. The majority of tritium was, however, found in the bulk, indicating that extraction of bulk tritium is essential for the decontamination of SS-316 exposed to tritium at high temperatures.

By the treatment in ozone gas of 400 ppmv at 400 K in the cases of stainless steel, the decontamination efficiencies of over 99% were obtained for 1 hour, and the decontamination efficiencies of aluminum were 80-86%. By the treatment of ozone gas, the quantity of the carbon atom on the surface and in inside layer were decreased, and the oxidation on the surface and in inside was proceeded, which may be assumed and expected that the recombination, release and diffusion to the surface of tritium are prevented by a rigid oxide layer generated. The ozone gas treatment is easy to use and apply in practice with a simple and safe operation. Furthermore, gas-phase decontamination technology has many advantages over conventional wet methods, in particular, its simple control processes and small secondary waste. The proposed decontamination technology has the sufficient ability and potential to simplify a decontamination operation and reduce the large volumes waste.

The processes of poisoning of LaNi47Al0.3 alloy are analyzed in detail by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), second ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), Auger-energy spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The changes of the valence and the concentration distribution of the elements of the alloy LaNi47Al0.3 poisoned by CO are studied. The process and the mechanism of CO's poisoning of alloy LaNi47Al0.3 are proposed as follows: CO is absorbed on the surface of alloy, part of which reacts with La forming LaC2 and La2O3, or reacts with Ni forming NiO and C in the surface layer, the rest of the CO is decomposed into C and O, which diffuse into the bulk to react with La, Ni and Al. These results in phase-split reaction in surface layer of the particle, and enrichment of La and impoverishment Ni on the surface have taken place. The poisoning effect decreases with a increase of depth. The diffusion depth of C is within 600 Angstrom in the surface layer, and that of 0 is within 1000 Angstrom. The oxide film and carbonizing film prevent the H-storage alloys from further absorbing hydrogen, which leads to a deceleration of the H-storage capability. Moreover, The formation of a new phase with poor H-absorption capability is caused by the phase split reactions, which is one of reasons for the decrease of H-absorption property of the H-storage alloys.

J	Klein, JE				Klein, JE			A 1600 liter tritium hydride storage vessel	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	NOV 12-16, 2001	TSUKUBA, JAPAN				URANIUM	Titanium was selected for evaluation as a tritium storage material. Titanium-deuterium desorption isotherm data at 550, 600, 649, 700, and 760degreesC are presented and were used to evaluate storage vessel design loading limits. Two prototype Hydride Storage Vessels (HSVs) containing a nominal 4400 grams of Ergenics HY-STOR 106(TM) titanium sponge were tested to determine activation, loading, and desorption conditions. HSV titanium activation was performed using two methods. The first was vacuum evacuation using stepped temperature holds up to 600degreesC. The second, and preferable method, was a dry gas purge for several hours at up to 350degreesC followed by heated evacuations at temperatures up to 600degreesC. The vessels were allowed to sit idle after activation for five days before loading to determine the quality of the activation process. HSV gas loadings were performed through the process tube inserted into the hydride at 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20 SLPM, and under conditions to simulate direct loading from a 1500 liter process tank. Temperature measurements made at various locations around the vessel showed the internal maximum temperature ranged from 500degreesC to 700degreesC and varied with loading rate. Maximum external temperatures ranged from 300degreesC at 5 SLPM to 400degreesC at 20 SLPM. Loading the HSV at 20 SLPM from the tube above the level of the hydride generated at maximum internal temperature of 800degreesC. HSV desorptions were done under a variety of vacuum conditions at temperatures up to 700degreesC. HSV desorption/gas removal was greatly reduced at temperatures below 700degreesC, the use of one instead of both process tubes, and the choice of vacuum pumps. Integration of mass flow data was considered a more reliable method of determining HSV gas inventory than the use of titanium isotherm data. Up to 84 vol% of the gas inventory can be removed from the HSV by desorption in 24 hours, but tritium removal by isotopic exchange will be needed for vessel disposal-even if longer evacuation times were used.

Analytical expressions are derived to describe the batch isotopic exchange process for metal hydrides with and without isotopic separation by the hydride. For the case without isotopic separation and the hydride being desorbed to the same gas inventory each exchange cycle, simple mathematical expressions are obtained. These equations can be used to estimate the number of exchange cycles needed to reduce the tritium content of a hydride to the desired inventory. Isotopic exchange predictions agreed with experimental results for La-Ni-Al alloys and titanium hydrides.

The bed contained 12.6 kg of a LaNi-Al alloy and used aluminum foam to improve heat transfer within the bed. Steady-state temperature measurements made at constant power showed a non-uniform bed temperature profile. Protium absorption rates were measured at pressures of 253 kPa, 413 kPa, and 680 kPa with forced convection cooling air flow rates ranging from 50 to 150 SLPM air. Absorption tests were also performed simulating the absorption of tritium and a method for estimating this rate using protium absorption data presented. Desorption rates were measured at pressures ranging from 20 kPa to 933 kPa using dual and single 400 watt electric heaters and found desorption rates were only impacted at the beginning and the end of a desorption cycle by the use of a single heater.

In all cases was it possible to completely restore the original sorption/desorption properties of the getter. In view of the needs of the Storage and Delivery System (SDS) of the ITER-FEAT Tritium Plant, i.e. delivery of T-2 90%-D-2 10% and pure D-2 to generate mixtures of various compositions, the isotope effects during sorption/desorption cycles of H-D and D-T mixtures in ZrCo granules have been investigated. A transportable storage vessel identical to those containing uranium presently used at TLK for the transport of tritium has been designed, build and filled with ZrCo. These beds fit into the highly sensitive calorimeters available at TLK. With these beds the tritium permanently trapped in U and ZrCo can be compared under similar operation conditions.

Since accounting for large inventories by the conventional TPVC (Temperature, Pressure, Volume, Concentration) is very cumbersome, it is highly desirable to perform accounting directly by the application of calorimetric methods, for example based on monitoring of temperature rise in the tritium storage container caused by heat of the tritium decay (1.95W/mol.T-2). Following an earlier evaluation(1) of the JET tritium storage containers by electrical simulation of heat of the tritium decay the viability of the method was proven by adiabatic calorimetry with known tritium inventories up to approximate to5900 TBq.

For this purpose, tritium will be supplied from heated bed with vacuum pump while heat of reaction is supplied externally. For recovery, hydriding reaction occurs at elevated temperature spontaneously. Kinetic behavior of the bed at the temperature around 300 degree-C was studied, and practical operation was successfully demonstrated. Isotopic composition change due to the difference of equilibrium temperature was concerned in supplying mixture, but the effect was found to be negligible. For rapid accountancy, ITER requirement of accuracy (+/-1%) was demonstrated by 25 g tritium storage ZrCo bed with "In-bed" gas flowing calorimetry. It was revealed that the accuracy is affected by the surrounding temperature, that could readily be controlled for better measurement. Thus technology and experience on storage and transport of large amount of tritium, that are inevitable in fusion tritium facility such as ITER Tritium Plant have been established by Japanese research facility and industry.

Part of the collaborative research centers on studies of the molten salt 2LiF-BeF2 (also known as Flibe) for fusion applications. Flibe has been proposed as a self-cooled breeder in both magnetic and inertial fusion power plant designs over the last twenty years. The key feasibility issues associated with the use of Flibe are the corrosion of structural material by the molten salt, tritium control in the molten salt blanket system, and safe handling practices and releases from Flibe during an accidental spill. An overview of the experimental program to address the key feasibility issues is presented.

It will depend mainly on the reactor materials, and not on the own process of energy production, contrarily to the fission technologies used today. The evaluation of the radiological environmental impact of tritium emission (routine, accidental) requires the use of mathematical and statistical models of dispersion to the biosphere. In the inertial fusion reactors (IFE) design, the coolant is a production source of tritium. We have used inventories of tritium from IFE such as HYLIFE II, OSIRIS, SOMBRERO and CASCADE.

Fusion plant equipped with power blanket will contain high temperature heat transfer medium and bred tritium in a tritium cycle. Although the inventory and throughput may not increase drastically from ITER, tritium plant will require significant technical improvements characterized by the self-consistent tritium fuel cycle and safety function to maintain the tritium level in the power train at adequately low level. Tritium balance issue will be one of the most important features because it will strongly affect the fusion in energy market by supplying initial loading. Tritium processing for coolant that will be mainly used for normal operation will dominate the safety feature of the entire plant by its technical difficulty and importance. Under off-normal conditions, this coolant tritium process can remove possible spill within the confinement, and thus fusion plant will not have any major process dedicated for accidents. Tritium technology is essential to make fusion energy attractive from the aspect of socio-economics, and its success in development is of vital importance toward fusion power plant as viable energy source for future.

In order to consider the implication of the possible tritium self-production, the potential of fusion energy in the future electricity supply market was estimated. Future energy market is analyzed with world energy and environment model that describes composition of supply-side energy system structures under economical and environmental constraint to meet the world energy demand. In the model, composition of supply-side energy system structures is determined to limit the CO2 concentration of 550ppm in 2100 with minimal energy system cost. The result revealed that after introduction to the market, share of the fusion energy is strongly restricted by the initial tritium supply. Capability to produce initial loading of tritium removes this limitation, and future fusion share could be doubled.

The simulation results of inherent delays in components of fuel processing subsystems demonstrates that tritium inventory in the tritium storage is influenced by a cumulative time lag system responses on the pulse operation continuity even when adoption of duty cycle is sustained. To satisfy pulse operation up to long pulse specified the capacity of the fuel processing subsystems and tritium storage will need to be increased by a number of fuel storage beds. Variation with the time of tritium product from isotope separation subsystem determines the time dependent characteristic of tritium inventory in the tritium storage. Representative value defined by the inherent system responses provides an information of optimum condition of pulse operation campaign.

Tritium was co-deposited as amorphous hydrogenated carbon onto graphite tiles and stainless steel surfaces inside the reactor. Since termination of plasma operations, carbon tritide particles have remained in the air in the vessel. Dosimetric limits for occupational exposure to carbon tritide particles need to be established. The purpose of this study was to characterize carbon tritide particle samples inside the TFTR in terms of size, self-absorption of tritium beta, and dissolution rate in simulated lung fluid. Dose estimates of the inhaled carbon tritide particles can be calculated based on the dissolution rate, particle size, and self-absorption factor. The count median diameter and geometric standard deviation were 1.23 mum and 1.72, respectively, indicating that they are respirable particles and can stay suspended in the air for a longer time. The dissolution rate in the lung-simulated fluid was determined in a static system. The dissolution rate ranged from 10(-1)-10(-3) per day in the first few hours, then it decreased to between 10(-3) and 10(-4). The retention curve of tritium in carbon indicated that >90% of the tritium remained in the particles after 110 d in the simulated lung fluid. This information is being used to support the establishment of respiratory protection requirements.

The experimental activities were focused on the determination of hydrogen/deuterium transport parameters through Eurofer 97 in the temperature range 423+723K using a time dependant permeation technique The hydrogen permeation and diffusivity at room temperature and density of trapping sites were also evaluated using Devanathan's technique. Hydrogen / deuterium permeation experiments on Eurofer 97 showed a non-negligible decrease in permeability with respect to other fusion oriented martensitic steels, even if it remains about one order of magnitude higher compared with that of austenitic AISI 316L steel.

The highest tritium level was found at the top of the dome or the private region and the outer baffle plates, where the plasma did not hit but the distance from the plasma was the shortest. For the divertor tiles, the tritium retention was very small. Such tritium distribution observed in JT-60U tiles can be well explained by the homogeneous implantation of rather high energy tritium and thermal release due to the heat load.

Superpermeable membranes being used for D/T separation from helium are able to drastically reduce the tritium load on the He pump (cryopump), while tritium accumulation in the membrane itself does not exceed a few g for a machine of ITER scale. A possible way to decrease the tritium inventory in the membrane is to combine a higher dissociative barrier at the upstream surface with the operation at higher temperature. Compression of permeating D/T attainable with superpermeable membranes is totally determined by the sticking coefficient of thermal hydrogen, molecules at the upstream surface. The degree of compression has a significant effect on the tritium inventory and the inventory dependence on the state of the downstream surface.

After the exposure in tritium gas (9 kPa gaseous tritium, 2 minutes exposure at 873 K and 40 minutes cooling), the tritium desorbed at room temperature and during heating up to 1123 K and total sorbed tritium of the samples were measured. The results showed that the desorbed tritium at room temperature was only 1-6% of total sorbed tritium and its amount order was : Kovar > copper > stainless steel > molybdenum. The total desorbed tritium was ranging from 2 to 22 MBq/cm(2), the largest is for Kovar and the smallest is for stainless steel. The tritium released from these materials at room temperature and during heating was mostly in the form of HTO. The thermo-desorption spectra of these materials were obtained. It was found that at least 5, 3, 3, 4 sorption states of tritium exist in the exposed Kovar, molybdenum, copper and stainless steel samples respectively, Doping 1% hydrogen in the carrying gas of helium during the thermo-desorption had rather effect on this process.
