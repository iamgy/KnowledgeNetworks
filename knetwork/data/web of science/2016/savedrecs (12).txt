Enhancing plutonium incineration in the thorium-based (IS)-S-2-LWR design with loading pattern optimization	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						(IS)-S-2-LWR; Thorium cycles; Plutonium incineration; Simulated Annealing; WIMS; PANTHER	PRESSURIZED-WATER-REACTORS	This paper presents an optimization of a thorium-plutonium fuel cycle, through a multi-batch reloading scheme, developed for the Integral Inherently Safe Light Water Reactor ((IS)-S-2-LWR). The (IS)-S-2-LWR is an advanced 2850 MWt integral pressurized water reactor with enhanced safety beyond that of Gen-III+ reactors. Its baseline fuel and cladding materials are U3Si2 and advanced FeCrAl steel, respectively. The advanced steel cladding can withstand longer exposure periods with significantly lower degradation rates compared to traditional Zr-based alloys. In principle, increasing the number of batches allows higher discharge burnups and thus deeper Pu and transuranic elements incineration to be achieved. Therefore, various refuelling strategies were considered in this study, namely 3-, 5- and 7.56-batch schemes. The Simulated Annealing optimization technique was applied for the different batch schemes to obtain the most favourable loading pattern with respect to cycle length performance. The results confirm that increasing the number of batches allows the discharge burnup to be increased by 20% (above 100 MWd/kg), which improves the Pu incineration performance. In addition, the increased number of batches improves the reactivity coefficients without violating the power peaking factors limits. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluation of JRC source term methodology using MAAP5 as a fast-running crisis tool for a BWR4 Mark I reactor	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						MAAP; MAAP5; Modelling; Simulation; Severe accident; Station black out; Source term; FASTRUN; Fast-running software tools; Boiling water reactor; Fission products & activity		JRC participated in the OECD/NEA FASTRUN benchmark reviewing fast-running software tools to model fission product releases during accidents at nuclear power plants. The main goal of fast-running software tools is to foresee the accident progression, so that mitigating actions can be taken and the population can be adequately protected. Within the FASTRUN, JRC used the MAAP 4.0.8 code and developed a methodology to obtain the source term (as activity released per radioisotope) of PWR and BWR station black-out accident scenarios. The modifications made in the MAAP models were limited to a minimum number of important parameters. This aims at reproducing a crisis situation with a limited time to adapt a generic input deck. This paper presents further studies, where JRC analysed the FASTRUN BWR scenario using MAAP 5.0.2 that has the capability of calculating doses. A sensitivity study was performed with the MAAP 5.0.2 DOSE package deactivated, using the same methodology as in the case of MAAP 4.0.8 for source term calculation. The results were close to the reference LTSBO SOARCA case, independently of the methodology used. One of the benefits of using the MAAP code is the short runtime of the simulations.

The reactor is a 110 cm-side cube with thorium-based molten salt as fuel, the moderator is graphite and the startup neutron source is Cf-252. It has ducts to hold the source, the fuel and for irradiation. In the design the k(eff) was estimated, varying the ducts features and fuel. For the final design, with Th-based salt, the neutron spectra and the ambient dose equivalent due to neutrons, the neutron amplification and the reactor power, were estimated using fresh and burned fuel conditions.

Numerical modeling of first experiments on PbLi MHD flows in a rectangular duct with foam-based SiC flow channel insert	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						DCLL blanket; Flow channel insert; Silicon carbide; Lead-lithium; MHD flow	US DCLL BLANKET; PRESSURE EQUALIZATION; TRITIUM TRANSPORT; HEAT-TRANSFER; FUSION; ISSUES; TBM	A flow channel insert (FCI) is the key element of the DCLL blanket concept. The FCI serves as electrical and thermal insulator to reduce the MHD pressure drop and to decouple the temperature-limited ferritic structure from the flowing hot lead-lithium (PbLi) alloy. The main focus of the paper is on numerical computations to simulate MHD flows in the first experiments on PbLi flows in a stainless steel rectangular duct with a foam-based silicon carbide (SiC) FCI. A single uninterrupted long-term (similar to 6500 h) test has recently been performed on a CVD coated FCI sample in the flowing PbLi in a magnetic field up to 1.5 T at the PbLi temperature of 300 degrees C using the MaPLE loop at UCLA. An unexpectedly high MHD pressure drop measured in this experiment suggests that a PbLi ingress into the FCI occurred in the course of the experiment, resulting in degradation of electroinsulating FCI properties. The ingress through the protective CVD layer was further confirmed by the post-experimental microscopic analysis of the FCI. The numerical modeling included 2D and 3D computations using HIMAG, COMSOL and a UCLA research code to address important flow features associated with the FCI finite length, fringing magnetic field, rounded FCI corners and also to predict changes in the MHD pressure drop in the unwanted event of a PbLi ingress. Two physical/mathematical models have been proposed and 3D and 2D computations performed to explain the experimental results. Although the computations do confirm that the SiC FCI can significantly reduce the MHD pressure drop, these first testing results that yet do not match the theoretical predictions, suggest that more work on the FCI development and testing is still needed, first of all to ensure that the FCI can withstand PbLi ingress in a long run.

The results of these measurements are reported for devices before and after irradiation up to a fluence of 14 x 10(15) n(eq)/cm(2). The charge collection and tracking efficiency of the different sensor thicknesses are compared. The outlook for future planar pixel sensor production is discussed, with a focus on sensor design with the pixel pitches (50 x 50 and 25 x 100 mu m(2)) foreseen for the RD53 Collaboration read-out chip in 65 nm CMOS technology. An optimization of the biasing structures in the pixel cells is required to avoid the hit efficiency loss presently observed in the punch-through region after irradiation. For this purpose the performance of different layouts have been compared in FE-14 compatible sensors at various fluence levels by using beam test data. Highly segmented sensors will represent a challenge for the tracking in the forward region of the pixel system at HL-LHC. In order to reproduce the performance of 50 x 50 mu m(2) pixels at high pseudo-rapidity values, FE-14 compatible planar pixel sensors have been studied before and after irradiation in beam tests at high incidence angle (80 degrees) with respect to the short pixel direction. Results on cluster shapes, charge collection and hit efficiency will be shown. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Novel methods for estimating 3D distributions of radioactive isotopes in materials	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Hiroshima Symposium on the Development and Application of Semiconductor Tracking Detectors (HSTD)	SEP 25-29, 2015	Xian Jiaotong Univ, Xian, PEOPLES R CHINA		Xian Jiaotong Univ	3D distribution; Environmental monitoring; Decontamination; Gamma camera	SPECTROMETRY; CS-137	In recent years, various gamma-ray visualization techniques, or gamma cameras, have been proposed. These techniques are extremely effective for identifying "hot spots" or regions where radioactive isotopes are accumulated. Examples of such would be nuclear-disaster-affected areas such as Fukushima or the vicinity of nuclear reactors. However, the images acquired with a gamma camera do not include distance information between radioactive isotopes and the camera, and hence are "degenerated" in the direction of the isotopes. Moreover, depth information in the images is lost when the isotopes are embedded in materials, such as water, sand, and concrete. Here, we propose two methods of obtaining depth information of radioactive isotopes embedded in materials by comparing (1) their spectra and (2) images of incident gamma rays scattered by the materials and direct gamma rays. In the first method, the spectra of radioactive isotopes and the ratios of scattered to direct gamma rays are obtained. We verify experimentally that the ratio increases with increasing depth, as predicted by simulations. Although the method using energy spectra has been studied for a long time, an advantage of our method is the use of low-energy (50-150 keV) photons as scattered gamma rays. In the second method, the spatial extent of images obtained for direct and scattered gamma rays is compared. By performing detailed Monte Carlo simulations using Geant4, we verify that the spatial extent of the position where gamma rays are scattered increases with increasing depth. To demonstrate this, we are developing various gamma cameras to compare low-energy (scattered) gamma -ray images with fully photo -absorbed gamma -ray images. We also demonstrate that the 3D reconstruction of isotopes/hotspots is possible with our proposed methods. These methods have potential applications in the medical fields, and in severe environments such as the nuclear-disaster-affected areas in Fukushima. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Isotopic composition analysis and age dating of uranium samples by high resolution gamma ray spectrometry	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Gamma spectrometry; Nuclear forensics; Uranium; Age dating		Non-destructive methods were applied to determine the isotopic composition and the time elapsed since last chemical purification of nine uranium samples. The applied methods are based on measuring gamma and X radiations of uranium samples by high resolution low energy gamma spectrometric system with planar high purity germanium detector and low background gamma spectrometric system with coaxial high purity germanium detector. The "Multigroup gamma-ray Analysis Method for Uranium" (MGAU) code was used for the precise determination of samples' isotopic composition. The age of the samples was determined from the isotopic ratio Bi-214/U-234. This ratio was calculated from the analyzed spectra of each uranium sample, using relative detection efficiency. Special attention is paid to the coincidence summing corrections that have to be taken into account when performing this type of analysis. In addition, an alternative approach for the age determination using full energy peak efficiencies obtained by Monte Carlo simulations with the GESPECOR code is described. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Thick-target transmission method for excitation functions of interaction cross sections	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Thick-target; Transmission method; Radioactive beam	FISSION-PRODUCTS; NUCLEAR; RADII	We propose a method, called as thick-target transmission (T3) method, to obtain an excitation function of interaction cross sections. In an ordinal experiment to measure the excitation function of interaction cross sections by the transmission method, we need to change the beam energy for each cross section. In the T3 method, the excitation function is derived from the beam attenuations measured at the targets of different thicknesses without changing the beam energy. The advantage of the T3 method is the simplicity and availability for radioactive beams. To confirm the availability, we perform a simulation for the C-12 + Al-27 system with the PHITS code instead of actual experiments. Our results have large uncertainties but well reproduce the tendency of the experimental data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The efficiency was estimated by considering two correction factors: coincidence-summing and self-absorption corrections. The coincidence-summing correction for a cascade transition nuclide was estimated by an experimental method involving measuring a sample at the far and close positions of a detector. The derived coincidence-summing correction factors were compared with those of analytical and Monte Carlo simulation methods and good agreements were obtained. Differences in the matrix of the calibration source and the environmental sample resulted in an increase or decrease of the full-energy peak counts due to the self-absorption of gamma-rays in the sample. The correction factor was derived as a function of the densities of several matrix materials. The present method was applied to the measurement of environmental samples and also low-level radioactivity measurements of water samples using the well-type detector.

Fusion studies with low-intensity radioactive ion beams using an active-target time projection chamber	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Fusion excitation functions; Be-10+Ar-40; Time projection chamber; Very low intensity beams; Radioactive ion beams		The total fusion excitation function for Be-10+Ar-40 has been measured over the center-of-momentum (c.m.) energy range from 12 to 24 MeV using a time-projection chamber (TPC). The main purpose of this experiment, which was carried out in a single run of duration 90 h using a approximate to 100 particle per second (pps)Be-10 beam, was to demonstrate the capability of an active-target TPC to determine fusion excitation functions for extremely weak radioactive ion beams. Cross sections as low as 12 mb were measured with acceptable (50%) statistical accuracy. It also proved to be possible to separate events in which charged particles were emitted from the fusion residue from those in which only neutrons were evaporated. The method permits simultaneous measurement of incomplete fusion, break-up, scattering, and transfer reactions, and therefore fully exploits the opportunities presented by the very exotic beams that will be available from the new generation of radioactive beam facilities.

Neutron angular distribution in plutonium-240 spontaneous fission	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Fission neutron anisotropy; Plutonium; Nuclear safeguards; MCNPX-PoliMi	PULSE-SHAPE-DISCRIMINATION; PROMPT NEUTRONS; ENERGY	Nuclear safeguards applications require accurate fission models that exhibit prompt neutron anisotropy. In the laboratory reference frame, an anisotropic neutron angular distribution is observed because prompt fission neutrons carry momentum from fully accelerated fission fragments. A liquid organic scintillation detector array was used with pulse shape discrimination techniques to produce neutron neutron cross-correlation time distributions and angular distributions from spontaneous fission in a Cf-252, a 0.84 g Pu-240(eff) metal, and a 1.63 g Pu-240(eff) metal sample. The effect of cross-talk, estimated with MCNPX-PoliMi simulations, is removed from neutron-neutron coincidences as a function of the angle between detector pairs. Fewer coincidences were observed at detector angles near 90, relative to higher and lower detector angles. As light output threshold increases, the observed anisotropy increases due to spectral effects arising from fission fragment momentum transfer to emitted neutrons. Stronger anisotropy was observed in Cf-252 spontaneous fission prompt neutrons than in Pu-240 neutrons. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Experimental setup and procedure for the measurement of the Be-7(n,alpha)alpha reaction at n_TOF	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Cosmological lithium problem; Big bang nucleosynthesis; Be-7(n,alpha)alpha reaction; n_TOF spallation neutron source	NEUTRON; FACILITY; OUTLOOK	The newly built second experimental area EAR2 of then n_ToF spallation neutron source at CERN allows to perform (n, charged particles) experiments on short-lived highly radioactive targets. This paper describes a detection apparatus and the experimental procedure for the determination of the cross-section of the Be-7(n,alpha)alpha reaction, which represents one of the focal points toward the solution of the cosmological Lithium abundance problem, and whose only measurement, at thermal energy, dates back to 1963. The apparently unsurmountable experimental difficulties stemming from the huge Be-7 gamma-activity, along with the lack of a suitable neutron beam facility, had so far prevented further measurements. The detection system is subject to considerable radiation damage, but is capable of disentangling the rare reaction signals from the very high background. This newly developed setup could likely be useful also to study other challenging reactions requiring the detectors to be installed directly in the neutron beam. (C) 2016 The Authors.

J	Goddard, B; Croft, S; Lousteau, A; Peerani, P				Goddard, Braden; Croft, Stephen; Lousteau, Angela; Peerani, Paolo			Evaluation of Am-Li neutron spectra data for active well type neutron multiplicity measurements of uranium	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Am-Li neutron spectrum; Neutron correlation counting; Monte; Carlo N-Particle eXtended (MCNPX); Active Well Coincidence Counter (AWCC)	OXIDE	Safeguarding nuclear material is an important and challenging task for the international community. One particular safeguards technique commonly used for uranium assay is active neutron correlation counting. This technique involves irradiating unused uranium with (alpha,. n) neutrons from an Am-Li source and recording the resultant neutron pulse signal which includes induced fission neutrons. Although this non-destructive technique is widely employed in safeguards applications, the neutron energy spectra from an Am-Li sources is not well known. Several measurements over the past few decades have been made to characterize this spectrum; however, little work has been done comparing the measured and theoretical spectra of various Am-Li sources to each other. This paper examines fourteen different Am-Li spectra, focusing on how these spectra affect simulated neutron multiplicity results using the code Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtended (MCNPX). Two measurement and simulation campaigns were completed using Active Well Coincidence Counter (AWCC) detectors and uranium standards of varying enrichment. The results of this work indicate that for standard AWCC measurements, the fourteen Am-Li spectra produce similar doubles and triples count rates. The singles count rates varied by as much as 20% between the different spectra, although they are usually not used in quantitative analysis, being dominated by scattering which is highly dependent on item placement.

Passive gamma analysis of the boiling-water-reactor assemblies	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Passive gamma; Initial enrichment; Burnup; Cooling time; Spent fuel; NDA; BWR		This research focused on the analysis of a set of stationary passive gamma measurements taken on the spent nuclear fuel assemblies from a boiling water reactor (BWR) using pulse height analysis data acquisition. The measurements were performed on 25 different BWR assemblies in 2014 at Sweden's Central Interim Storage Facility for Spent Nuclear Fuel (Clab). This study was performed as part of the Next Generation of Safeguards Initiative Spent Fuel project to research the application of nondestructive assay (NDA) to spent fuel assemblies. The NGSI-SF team is working to achieve the following technical goals more easily and efficiently than in the past using nondestructive assay (NDA) measurements of spent fuel assemblies: (1) verify the initial enrichment, burnup, and cooling time of facility declaration; (2) detect the diversion or replacement of pins, (3) estimate the plutonium mass, (4) estimate the decay heat, and (5) determine the reactivity of spent fuel assemblies. The final objective of this project is to quantify the capability of several integrated NDA instruments to meet the aforementioned goals using the combined signatures of neutrons, gamma rays, and heat. This report presents a selection of the measured data and summarizes an analysis of the results. Specifically, trends in the count rates measured for spectral lines from the following isotopes were analyzed as a function of the declared burnup and cooling time: Cs-137, Eu-154, Cs-134, and to a lesser extent, Ru-106 and Ce-144. From these measured count rates, predictive algorithms were developed to enable the estimation of the burnup and cooling time. Furthermore, these algorithms were benchmarked on a set of assemblies not included in the standard assemblies set used by this research team. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Laser resonance ionization scheme development for tellurium and germanium at the dual Ti:Sa-Dye ISOLDE RILIS	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						RILIS; ISOLDE; Germanium; Tellurium; Autoionizing; Laser ionization	TE-I; PHOTOIONIZATION; ISOTOPES; SPECTRUM; SERIES	The resonance ionization laser ion source (RILLS) is the principal ion source of the ISOLDE radioactive beam facility based at CERN. Using the method" of in-source laser resonance ionization spectroscopy, a transition to a new autoionizing state of tellurium was discovered and applied as part of a three-step, three-resonance, photo-ionization scheme. In a second study, a three-step, two-resonance, photo ionization scheme for germanium was developed and the ionization efficiency was measured at ISOLDE. This work increases the range of ISOLDE RILIS ionized beams to 31 elements. Details of the spectroscopy studies are described and the new ionization schemes are summarized. (C) 2015 The Authors.

GISELE is an off-line RILIS test bench to study the implementation of an on-line laser ion source at the GANIL separator facility. The aim of this project is to determine the best technical solution which combines high selectivity and ionization efficiency with small ion beam emittance and stable long term operation. The ion source geometry was tested in several configurations in order to find a solution with optimal ionization efficiency and beam emittance. Furthermore, a low work function material was tested to reduce the contaminants and molecular sidebands generated.inside the ion source. First results with ZrC ionizer tubes will be presented. Furthermore, a method to measure the energy distribution of the ion beam as a function of the time of flight will be discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Henares, J.

J	Zaffora, B; Magistris, M; Saporta, G; La Torre, FP				Zaffora, Biagio; Magistris, Matteo; Saporta, Gilbert; La Torre, Francesco Paolo			Statistical sampling applied to the radiological characterization of historical waste	EPJ NUCLEAR SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article								The evaluation of the activity of radionuclides in radioactive waste is required for its disposal in final repositories. Easy-to-measure nuclides, like gamma-emitters and high-energy X-rays, can be measured via non-destructive nuclear techniques from outside a waste package. Some radionuclides are difficult-to-measure (DTM) from outside a package because they are alpha- or beta-emitters. The present article discusses the application of linear regression, scaling factors (SF) and the so-called "mean activity method" to estimate the activity of DTM nuclides on metallic waste produced at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Various statistical sampling techniques including simple random sampling, systematic sampling, stratified and authoritative sampling are described and applied to 2 waste populations of activated copper cables. The bootstrap is introduced as a tool to estimate average activities and standard errors in waste characterization. The analysis of the DTMNi-63 is used as an example. Experimental and theoretical values of SFs are calculated and compared. Guidelines for sampling historical waste using probabilistic and non-probabilistic sampling are finally given.

J	Wernli, C				Wernli, Christian			A SHORT HISTORY AND CRITICAL REVIEW OF INDIVIDUAL MONITORING	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								Soon after the discovery of X-rays and the radioactive element radium harmful radiation effects occurred, mainly in the medical field. Consequently, the radiologists, a new profession at that time, called for a limitation of radiation exposures. First proposals were to limit the exposure rate to prevent the incidence of skin erythema. It took more than two decades and there were many victims of severe radiation effects until a sound basis for radiation protection and individual monitoring was established. For external dosimetry, the film dosemeter was invented in the 1920s. This device, often combined with an ion chamber-based pencil dosemeter, dominated the systems used in personnel dosimetry until the end of the twentieth century. For internal exposure, the concept of limiting the body burden was commonly used, and only in the late 1970s, the new concept of the effective dose equivalent published in ICRP publication 26 allowed for a unified interpretation and, therefore, addition of the dosimetric quantities for external and internal exposures. By the end of the last century, individual monitoring had to survive an inflation of proposals for new quantities, but fortunately, it was also the time of vast developments of new technologies, methods and procedures. Later on, much room was given to highly sophisticated regulations, requirements, metrological concepts and administrative procedures. In this complex environment, the original task of individual monitoring became more and more hidden behind secondary loads. Now, like about hundred years ago, however with different motivation, once again the ultimate goal of the professional work has to be thought about by asking: Do people always know why they do what they do? Or simply: Why individual monitoring?			christian.wernli@alumni.ethz.ch					International Atomic Energy Agency, 1999, IAEATECDOC1071; Kathren R., 1980, HLTH PHYS BACKWARD G, P1; Lindell B, 1996, RADIAT PROT DOSIM, V68, P83; Wachsmann F, 1961, P S SEL TOP RAD DOS; Wernli C, 2003, OCCUPATIONAL RAD PRO; [Anonymous], 2007, RAD PROT DOSIM, V125; [Anonymous], 1971, 19 ICRU; [Anonymous], 2011, RAD PROT DOSIM, V144; [Anonymous], 2001, RAD PROT DOSIM, V96; [Anonymous], 1976, 25 ICRU; [Anonymous], 1987, P TECHN COMM M; [Anonymous], 2015, INT C IND MON ION RA; [Anonymous], 1994, RAD PROT DOSIM, V54; [Anonymous], 1958, RECOMMENDATIONS INT; [Anonymous], 1982, PHOT DOS 4 INF SEM R, V30; [Anonymous], 1959, ICRP PUBL, V2; [Anonymous], 1934, RADIOLOGY, V23, P580, DOI Rediology	17	0	0	0	0	OXFORD UNIV PRESS	OXFORD	GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND	0144-8420	1742-3406		RADIAT PROT DOSIM	Radiat.

SECOND LATIN AMERICAN INTERCOMPARISON ON INTERNAL DOSE ASSESSMENT	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								Internal dosimetry intercomparisons are essential for the verification of applied models and the consistency of results'. To that aim, the First Regional Intercomparison was organised in 2005, and that results led to the Second Regional Intercomparison Exercise in 2013, which was organised in the frame of the RLA 9/066 and coordinated by Autoridad Regulatoria Nuclear of Argentina. Four simulated cases covering intakes of I-131, Cs-137 and Tritium were proposed. Ninteen centres from thirteen different countries participated in this exercise. This paper analyses the participants' results in this second exercise in order to test their skills and acquired knowledge, particularly in the application of the IDEAS Guidelines. It is important to highlight the increased number of countries that participated in this exercise compared with the first one and, furthermore, the improvement in the overall performance. The impact of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Projects since 2003 has led to a significant enhancement of internal dosimetry capabilities that strengthen the radiation protection of workers.

Close source-to-detector geometry (at 0.3 m or less) was employed to practical tests for portable dose meters to accumulate statistically sufficient ionizing currents. Difference between response in the present experimentally studied field and in the reference field complied with ISO 4037 due to non-uniformity of radiation fluence at close geometry was corrected by use of Monte Carlo simulation. As a consequence, corrected results were consistent with the results obtained in the ISO 4037 reference field within their uncertainties.

CALIBRATION OF A WHOLE BODY COUNTER FOR (241)AM WITH THE LLNL CHEST PHANTOM	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								An occupational incorporation event occurred at the Radioactive Waste Treatment and Disposal Facility in December 2013 at Puspokszilagy, Hungary. Internal contamination due to Am-241 was discovered by a regular routine whole body counting measurement at the Centre for Energy Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences. After that, a whole body counter was calibrated for an organ counting geometry. For preliminary calibration, a home-made MIX-D chest phantom was applied simulating uniform lung activity distribution by Am-241 point sources located in different positions within the lung volume of the phantom. In order to carry out a more precise calibration, a Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) chest phantom was provided by the International Atomic Energy Agency. For counting efficiency over the lungs, values of 0.46 +/- 0.19 and 0.55 +/- 0.07 cps kBq (1) were obtained for the MIX-D and the LLNL phantom, respectively; thus, the results are in good agreement.

EURADOS Report 2013-01, Braunschweig (2013)] provide a structured approach to the assessment of intakes of radionuclides. In order to check that the guidelines, when applied to typical monitoring programmes, lead to reliable assessments, a number of numerically-generated datasets have been constructed and assessed using the guidelines. The dose and intake obtained by the assessment can be compared with the 'true' dose and intake. In this way, the accuracy of the IDEAS assessment process can be examined when applied to monitoring programmes that are typically used in the nuclear industry. The simulations focus on assessments carried out as a result of elevated Pu-239 activities in routine urine samples, which lead to follow-up urine and faecal samples being provided. Cases where the assessor makes the correct initial assumption about lung solubility can be compared with cases where this initial choice is wrong. The results of these simulations and the implication for the use of monitoring programmes are discussed.

It was irradiated with alpha particles from a Am-241 (2.3 kBq) and a Po-210 (9 kBq) source at source-detector distances (SDD) of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.8 cm. The energy resolution in terms of full width at half maximum was 281, 148 and 113 keV for SDD of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.8 cm, respectively. The minimum detectable activity increased from 0.08 to 0.83 Bq when the SDD increased from 0.5 to 1.8 cm. The detector has the potential for several alpha spectrometric applications, such as monitoring for wound, skin and surface contamination at nuclear fuel facilities, nuclear power plants and facilities handling radioactive waste. Other areas are environmental surveys following releases of actinides at accidents in nuclear power plants and in connection with other radiological or nuclear scenarios.

ENHANCED RADIOACTIVE CONTENT OF 'BALANCE' BRACELETS	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY	During a routine whole body counting measurement of a worker at the Nuclear Research Center Negev, abnormal activities of Th-232 and U-238 were measured. After a thorough investigation, it was found that the radioactivity was due to a rubber bracelet ('balance bracelet') worn by the worker during the measurement. The bracelet was counted directly by an high pure germanium gamma spectrometry system, and the specific activities determined were 10.80 +/- 1.37 Bq g(-1) for Th-232 and 5.68 +/- 0.88 Bq g(-1) for natural uranium. These values are obviously high compared with normally occurring radioactive material (NORM) average values. The dose rate to the wrist surface was estimated to be similar to 3.9 mu Gy h(-1) and similar to 34 mGy for a whole year. The dose rate at the centre of the wrist was estimated to be similar to 2.4 mu Gy h(-1) and similar to 21 mGy for a whole year. The present findings stresses a more general issue, as synthetic rubber and silicone products are common and widely used, but their radioactivity content is mostly uncontrolled, thus causing unjustified exposure due to enhanced NORM radioactivity levels.

OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO RADON IN DIFFERENT KINDS OF NON-URANIUM MINES	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								For more accurate assessments of the occupational exposure to radon for miners, the individual monitoring was conducted by using an improved passive integrating Rn-222 monitor. A total of 120 miners in 3 different kinds of mines were monitored throughout a year. The results showed that the individual exposure to radon significantly varied with types of mines and work. Compared with the exposure to coal miners, the exposure to copper miners was much higher. Furthermore, it was found that the exposure might be overestimated if the environmental Rn-222 monitored by the passive integrating monitors was used for assessment. The results indicate that the individual monitoring of radon is necessary for an accurate assessment of radon exposure to miners, and radon exposure to non-uranium miners should also be assessed from the viewpoint of radiation protection.

Caesium clearance in the monitored workers is in agreement with the biokinetic models proposed by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. After 500 d from the initial measurement, however, the caesium clearance slowed. It was thought to be unlikely that additional Cs intake had occurred after the initial intake, as activity in foods was kept low. And, the contribution from the detector over the chest was enhanced with time. This indicates that insoluble Cs particles were inhaled and a long metabolic rate showed.

DOSE TO RADIOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGISTS FROM INDUCED RADIONUCLIDES IN CARBON ION RADIOTHERAPY	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							RADIATION-THERAPY; ACCELERATORS	Radioactive nuclides are induced in irradiation devices and patients during high-energy photon and ion beam radiotherapies. These nuclides potentially become sources of exposure to radiation workers. Radiological technologists (RTs) are often required to enter an irradiation room and approach activated devices and patients. In this study, annual doses to RTs working in a carbon ion radiotherapy facility were estimated based on measurements with the Si-semiconductor personal dosemeter. In addition, the time decay of dose around a patient couch after irradiation was obtained by phantom experiments. The annual H-p(10) values for passive and scanned beams were estimated to be 61 and 2 mu Sv, respectively, when assuming the number of treatments in 2013. These are much lower than the ICRP recommended dose limit for radiation workers. The time-series data of dose to RTs during their work and the time decay of the dose should be helpful for reducing their dose further.

The aim of this study is estimation of radon and progeny sourced effective dose for the people who are working at the spa facilities by measuring radon activity concentration (RAC) at the ambient air of indoor spa pools and dressing rooms. As it is known, the source of the radon gas is the radium content of the earth crust. Therefore, thermal waters coming from ground may contain dissolved radon and the radon can diffuse water to air. So the ambient air of spa pools can contain serious RAC that depends on a lot of parameters. In this regard, RAC measurements were executed at the 70 spa facilities in Turkey. The measurements were done with both active and passive methods at ambient air of spa pools and dressing rooms. Thus, active measurements were carried out by using the Alphaguard (R) with diffusion mode during half an hour, and passive measurements were carried out by using the humidity resistive CR-39 radon detectors during 2 months. Results show that RAC values at ambient air of spa pools varies between 13 Bq m(-3) and 10 kBq m(-3). Because long-term measurements are more reliable, if it is available, for dose calculations passive radon measurements (with CR-39 detectors) at ambient air of spa pools and dressing rooms were used, otherwise active measurement results were used. With the measurement by the conversion coefficients of ICRP 65 and occupational data of the employees has got from questionary forms, effective dose values were calculated. According to the calculations, spa employees are exposed to annual average dose between 0.05 and 29 mSv because of radon and progeny.

NUMERICAL ASSESSMENT OF I-131 DEPOSITED IN THYROID FOR NON-STANDARD SITUATIONS	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							INTERNAL DOSIMETRY; VOXEL PHANTOMS; MONTE; AM-241	At the CIEMAT whole-body counter, a low-energy germanium detector is used for the in vivo assessment of I-131 activity in thyroid, mainly for the individual monitoring programmes of workers. The detector is calibrated with a cylindrical neck phantom made of polymethyl methacrylate that mimics the neck of an adult, containing a vial with a radioactive solution. For an accurate activity assessment, it is necessary to perform the calibration of the detector with phantoms that closely reproduce the anatomy of a real person. Nevertheless, it is not affordable to count on a variety of physical phantoms covering the different anatomical characteristics that could be found over the whole population, including children. An alternative approach to face this situation is offered by the numerical calibration procedure based on Monte Carlo calculations in conjunction with realistic voxel phantoms. A series of computational voxel phantoms of different ages and dimensions have been used in this work to simulate an internal contamination of the thyroid and to estimate the response of the detector for measurements involving individuals whose anatomical characteristics differ from the reference adult man.

In case of contamination, the activity burden inside the lungs should be assessed accurately. Many studies showed that the presence of breasts has a substantial influence on lung counting efficiencies. Currently, the calibration of most lung counting systems is done by means of physical phantoms representing only male chests. A set of female computational phantoms has been developed in order to provide gender-specific efficiency calibrations for the Am-241 gamma emission (59.54 keV). The phantoms were created starting from a library of female chest phantoms provided by Institut de radioprotection et de surete nucleaire (IRSN) (Farah, J. Amelioration des mesures anthroporadiametriques personnalisees assistees par calcul Monte Carlo: optimisation des temps de calculs et methodologie de mesure pour l'etablissement de la repartition d'activite. PhD Thesis, 2011). While the IRSN phantoms represent a supine measurement position, the SCK center dot CEN lung counter set-up requires the persons to be sitting in a chair. Using open-source software, the breast shapes of the original phantoms have been recreated to simulate the drooping of breasts in vertical sitting position. A Monte Carlo approach was chosen for calculating calibration coefficients for female lung counting. The results obtained with MCNPx 2.7 simulations showed a significant decrease in the detection efficiency. For bigger bust and breast sizes, the detection efficiency showed to be up to 10 times lower than the ones measured with the Livermore male torso phantom.

These measurements were made using a NaI(Tl) spectrometer and a whole-body counter shortly after the accident. Their thyroid equivalent doses (I-131) were estimated to be 0.9-1.4 mSv under the assumption of acute intake via inhalation on 15 March, when the first significant release event was observed. Although greatly depending on the physicochemical form of iodine, the intake amount ratios of I-131 to Cs-137 for the three subjects were calculated as 2.7-3.7, which were much smaller than the radioactivity ratio (7.8) found in air sampling at the same site.

SiC detectors to monitor ionizing radiations emitted from nuclear events and plasmas	RADIATION EFFECTS AND DEFECTS IN SOLIDS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th Workshop on European Collaboration for Higher Education and Research in Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Protection	MAY 30-JUN 01, 2016	Cervia, ITALY	Univ Bologna, Univ Catania, Univ Milan		SiC detectors; Schottky diode; dosimeter; laser-generated plasma	DOSIMETRY; LASER	Silicon Carbide (SiC) semiconductor detectors are increasingly employed in Nuclear Physics for their advantages with respect to traditional silicon (Si). Such detectors show an energy resolution, charge mobility, response velocity and detection efficiency similar to Si detectors. However, the higher band gap (3.26eV), the lower leakage current (approximate to 10pA) maintained also at room temperature, the higher radiation hardness and the higher density with respect to Si represent some indisputable advantages characterizing such detectors. The devices can be employed at high temperatures, at high absorbed doses and in the case of high visible light intensities, for example, in plasma, for limited exposition times without damage. Generally SiC Schottky diodes are employed in reverse polarization with an active region depth of the order of 100 mu m, purity below 10(14)cm(-3) and an active area lower than 1cm(2). Measurements in the regime of proportionality with the radiation energy released in the active region and measurements in time-of-flight configuration are employed for nuclear emission events produced at both low and high fluences. Alpha spectra demonstrated an energy resolution of about 1.3% at 5.8MeV. Radiation emission from laser-generated plasma can be monitored in terms of detected photons, electrons and ions, using the laser pulse as a start signal and the radiation detection as a stop signal, enabling to measure the ion velocity by knowing the target-detector flight distance. SiC spectra acquired in the Messina University laboratories using radioactive ion sources and at the PALS laboratory facility in Prague (Czech Republic) are presented. A preliminary study of the use of SiC detectors, embedded in a water equivalent polymer, as a dosimeter is presented and discussed.

For this reason when considering dismantling of such accelerators, the amount of radioactive waste has to be evaluated in advance to identify any critical issues or possible countermeasures to be taken to define an optimum decommissioning strategy. The aim of this work is to define a non-destructive in situ measurement methodology for a preliminary activation assessment of a cyclotron bunker with no need for core drilling. A very compact, USB-powered, CdZnTe (CZT) detector for gamma-ray spectrometry was used for the activation assessment of the site of installation of a GE PETtrace (16.5MeV) cyclotron, routinely used in the production of positron-emitting radionuclides. Because of the complexity of measurement geometry, the efficiency calibration of the detector was performed via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The detector was accurately modelled using FLUKA, including a 5cm lead shielding set-up. The MC model of the detector was validated for a wide range of energies and different source geometries, showing discrepancies below 5% for all tested sources. The efficiency curve for wall activation measurements was calculated, allowing a quantitative evaluation of activity concentration.

Flux trap effect study in a sub-critical neutron assembly using activation methods	RADIATION EFFECTS AND DEFECTS IN SOLIDS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th Workshop on European Collaboration for Higher Education and Research in Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Protection	MAY 30-JUN 01, 2016	Cervia, ITALY	Univ Bologna, Univ Catania, Univ Milan		Subcritical assembly; neutron flux trap; activation detectors	RESEARCH REACTOR	The neutron flux trap effect was experimentally studied in the subcritical assembly of the Atomic and Nuclear Physics Laboratory of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, using delayed gamma neutron activation analysis. Measurements were taken within the natural uranium fuel grid, in vertical levels symmetrical to the Am-Be neutron source, before and after the removal of fuel elements, permitting likewise a basic study of the vertical flux profile. Three identical flux traps of diamond shape were created by removing four fuel rods for each one. Two (n, ) reactions and one (n, p) threshold reaction were selected for thermal, epithermal and fast flux study. Results of thermal and epithermal flux obtained through the Au-197 (n, ) Au-198 and W-186 (n, ) W-187 reactions, with and without Cd covers, to differentiate between the two flux regions. The Ni-58 (n, p) Co-58 reaction was used for the fast flux determination. An interpolation technique based on local procedures was applied to fit the cross sections data and the neutron flux spectrum. End results show a maximum thermal flux increase of 105% at the source level, pointing to a high potential to increase in the available thermal flux for future experiments. The increase in thermal flux is not accompanied by a comparable decrease in epithermal or fast flux, since thermal flux gain is higher than epithermal and fast neutron flux loss. So, the neutron reflection is mainly responsible for the thermal neutron increase, contributing to 89% at the central axial position.

Radiation protection issues in the excavation of road and railway tunnels, a preliminary assessment	RADIATION EFFECTS AND DEFECTS IN SOLIDS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th Workshop on European Collaboration for Higher Education and Research in Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Protection	MAY 30-JUN 01, 2016	Cervia, ITALY	Univ Bologna, Univ Catania, Univ Milan		Tunnel excavation; natural radioactivity; radon exhalation; workers dosimetry	RADON EMANATION; BUILDING-MATERIALS; SOIL	In road and railway tunnel excavation, personnel are exposed to natural radiation. Exposure can have varying degrees of significance, as naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) content may vary by more than one order of magnitude depending on local lithology and, as far as radon is concerned, depending also on features of more distant bedrocks involved in radon convection. Radon exhalation and build up in the confined environment of the tunnel is affected by permeability of rocks, which is highly variable with lithology. Excavation methods as well have an impact on workers' exposure, due both to exposure time and to protection afforded by the equipment. Therefore, it is of interest to develop a method to predict radon levels to characterize the work area. Since drill cores are invariably taken before excavation begins, for a preliminary assessment of the geology involved, a method is proposed here for predicting radon levels, based on NORM and exhalation measurements in drill core samples, and on the geometry of the tunnel to be excavated. An experimental campaign is under way on a railway tunnel under construction in northwestern Italy: preliminary results will be presented and predicted values compared to experimental measurements.

The main sources of exposure are the inhalation of radon and its decay products released from the water and soil and terrestrial gamma-radiation. In order to evaluate the potential risk of thermal regions in Bursa, located in the impact area of the NAF (North Anatolian Fault), radon and thoron concentrations in soil gas, radon concentrations in thermal waters and outdoor gamma radiation levels were measured in thermal regions that have different geological formations. The radon and thoron concentrations in soil-gas were found to vary from 2272 +/- 121 to 245196 +/- 3455 Bq m(-3) and from 999 +/- 218 to 178 848 +/- 17 742 Bq m(-3), respectively. The radon concentrations in thermal waters ranged from 0.99 +/- 0.21 to 226.74 +/- 2.51 Bq l(-1) in the rainy season and from 0.26 +/- 0.10 to 178.03 +/- 12.86 Bq l(-1) in the dry season. The measured outdoor gamma radiation levels varied from 38 to 180 nGy h(-1). The gamma dose rates were found to be strong positively correlating with the radon and thoron concentrations in soil-gas. The radon and outdoor gamma radiation levels were observed to be a function of the geological formations of the area.

Various radioactive gas capture strategies have been employed historically including expensive automated compression systems. We have implemented a new cost-effective strategy employing gas capture bags with electronic feedback that are integrated with the cyclotron safety system. Our strategy is suitable for multiple automated F-18 radiosynthesis modules and individual automated C-11 radiosynthesis modules. We describe novel gas capture systems that minimize the risk of human error and are routinely used in our facility.	[Stimson, D. H. R.; Pringle, A. J.; Maillet, D.; King, A. R.; Nevin, S.

Direct total body Bi-214 measurements and their implications for radon dose assessment	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article						radon progeny; whole body counting; Bi-214; metabolism	DECAY PRODUCTS; CONTAMINATION; EXHALATION; PROGENY; GREECE	Direct Bi-214 bioassays may elucidate some of the uncertainties related to the relationship between the ambient concentration of radon and its short-lived decay products and the corresponding radiation burdens of individual human subjects. Sequential total body Bi-214 activity measurements were carried out on a group of 67 healthy adult volunteers living in a region with moderate airborne radioactivity and conducting similar daily activities using a whole-body counter equipped with sixteen NaI(Tl) detectors. The total body Bi-214 activity in the studied subjects was related to gender, fat-free mass and the season of the year. Approximately 95% and 92% of the Bi-214 activity measured during the cold seasons of the year in men and women, respectively, was attributed to radon progeny inhalation. Following acute exposure to high airborne radioactivity over a short time period, the Bi-214 enhancement in a volunteer decreased exponentially with time post-exposure, with a half-time of about 40 min. Taking into account the anticipated low Bi-214 activity in the vast majority of individuals, and the uncertainties in Bi-214 biodistribution even during counting, accurate measurements can be obtained using high-sensitivity whole-body counters with almost geometrical invariant counting efficiency.

After administration of C-13-labeled glucose, the volunteers ingested controlled diets with a fixed number of calories for 112 d. Samples of breath and urine were collected up to 112 d after administration. Samples of feces were collected up to 14 d after administration. Hair samples were obtained at 119 d after administration and analyzed as a representative index of the rate of excretion of organic C-13 via pathways such as skin cell exfoliation and mucus secretion. All samples were analyzed for C-13/C-12 atomic ratio to determine the rate of excretion via each pathway. We then constructed a metabolic model with a total of four pathways (breath, urine, feces, and other) comprising seven compartments. We determined the values of the biokinetic parameters in the model by using the obtained excretion data. From 74% to 94% of the C-13 administered was excreted in breath, whereas <2% was excreted in urine and feces. In the other pathway, the excretion rate constant in the compartment with the longest residence time stretched to hundreds of days but the rate constant for each subject was not statistically significant (P value > 0.1). In addition, the dataset for one of the three subjects was markedly different from those of the other two. When we estimated the 50 year cumulative body burden for C-13 by using our model and we included non-statistically significant parameters, a considerable cumulative body burden was found in the compartments excreting to the other pathway. Although our results on the cumulative body burden of C-13 from orally administered carbon as glucose were inconclusive, we found that the compartments excreting to the other pathway had a markedly long residence time and therefore should be studied further to clarify the fate of carbon in the human body. In addition to excreta, data for serum and blood cell samples were also collected from the subjects to examine the metabolism of C-13 in human body.

Building protection- and building shielding-factors for environmental exposure to radionuclides and monoenergetic photon emissions	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article						contaminant deposition; building protection factor; building shielding factor; probabilistic risk assessment; radiological emergency response planning	RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURES; URBAN ENVIRONMENTS; GAMMA-EXPOSURES	We describe a simplified method for calculating both building protection-and shielding-factors for generic one-and two-story housing-unit models that are source-term dependent. Typically, radionuclide-independent factors are applied generically to external dose coefficients to account for the radiation shielding effects of indoor residences. In reality, the shielding effectiveness of each housing-unit would change over time as the radionuclide mixture and gamma-ray energy spectrum change due to physical effects such as deposition, radioactive decay, weathering effects, and decontamination efforts. Thus, it is necessary to develop factors designed for multiple photon energy spectrums to generate a more realistic estimate of the shielding effectiveness of a particular building. It is impractical to develop factors specific to a spectrum of photons emitted by each radionuclide of interest. Therefore, Monte Carlo simulations have been performed for sixteen monoenergetic photon energies from 0.10 to 3.0 MeV to characterize the 3D radiation fluence through each housing-unit produced by two idealized, yet realistic, environmental exposure scenarios. Results of these simulations were then used to develop fitted logarithmic functions (extrapolated to 0.0 MeV) to correlate an estimated factor to any monoenergetic photon energy up to 3.0 MeV. To verify these functions, another series of Monte Carlo simulations were performed for a select set of radionuclides to develop radionuclide-specific building protection-and shielding-factors. Good agreement is achieved between factors estimated using the presented functions and those calculated directly using Monte Carlo methods. Factors predicted by these functions are found to be in general agreement with other study results reported on similar structures which applied various computational methods and source-terms. This study only focuses on generic one- and two-story homes to provide a practical application that can contribute to improve the preparedness for and the response to a nuclear or radiological emergency.

Lessons learnt from the radiological measures performed by the Radiological Emergency Network of Extremadura in the International Emergency Exercise CURIEX 2013	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article						real time measurements; radiation environmental characterization; decision making; nuclear accident exercise response	ENVIRONMENTAL-RADIOACTIVITY; RADIATION	In late 2013 (5th-7th of November), the Caceres Urgent Response International Exercise (CURIEX 2013) took place to test the Nuclear Emergency Plan of Caceres (PENCA) with the collaboration of both national and international support teams. The theme of the exercise was the simulation of a nuclear accident at the Almaraz Nuclear Power Plant located in Extremadura (Spain) with release of radioactive plume. From the point of view of radioactive contamination, the CURIEX exercise objective was to assess the capability of the different radiological teams to quantify the radioactive impact that would occur in this environment, a goal in which the Radiological Emergency Network of Extremadura (RARE) is directly implicated. The present paper analyses in detail the environmental radiological and dosimetrical results obtained by the Radiological Emergency Network of Extremadura during the CURIEX exercise. The rapid radioactivity measurement techniques on air and soil samples performed by the RARE's mobile lab involves great uncertainties. However, the results show a relative good effectiveness both in dose rate car-borne measurements and gamma soil spectrometry with uncertainties over 40%. It also shows a good correlation between the dose rate values measured by car-borne apparatus and those calculated from gamma spectrometry measurements. The capability of the RARE's facilities are evaluated in both the measurements, showing whether or not there is a radiological problem, and the transmission of that data to the decision centres in the shortest time. Although the results were highly satisfactory, some shortcomings were detected and therefore some improvements are proposed in the paper, in order to achieve a greater capacity in response to an event with the characteristics simulated in the CURIEX exercise.

Assessment of occupational exposure in a granite quarry and processing factory	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article						granite; dose; inhalation; dust; NORM; radon; worker	NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; SPAIN	Workers in the granite industry face an occupational hazard: silicosis due to the crystalline silica present in inhalable dust. As granite can also present a variable, and occasionally significant, content of naturally occurring radionuclides, they may also face a radiological hazard. In order to assess the risk, a granite industry with a quarry and processing factory was selected to assess the occupational exposure. Three main potential pathways were observed: external irradiation, inhalation of granite dust, and radon exposure. The external dose rate was similar to that in a nearby farming area. A slight increment (0.016-0.076 mSv yr(-1)) was observed in the quarry and stockpile, due to quarry faces and granite blocks. The effective dose due to granite dust inhalation was 0.182 +/- 0.009 mSv yr(-1) in the worst case scenario (3 mg m(-3) dust load in air and no use of filter masks). Thus, the mean value of the effective dose from these two pathways was 0.26 mSv yr(-1), lower than the reference level of 1 mSv yr(-1) for the general population. The annual mean value of radon concentration in the indoor air was 33 Bq m(-3). However, during granite processing works the radon concentration can increase up to 216 Bq m-3, due to mechanical operations (sawing, polishing, sanding, etc). This radon concentration was below the 600 Bq m(-3) reference level for action in working places. Therefore, workers in this granite factory face no significant additional radiological exposure, and no-one needs to be designated as occupationally exposed and subject to individual dosimetry.

Radon induced hyperplasia: effective adaptation reducing the local doses in the bronchial epithelium	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article						adaptive response; alpha-particles; computational epithelium model; hyperplasia; microdosimetry; radon exposure	INHALED RADON; URANIUM MINERS; LUNG-CANCER; ALPHA-PARTICLES; CELLS; EXPOSURE; NUMBER; RADIATION; PROGENIES; MODEL	There is experimental and histological evidence that chronic irritation and cell death may cause hyperplasia in the exposed tissue. As the heterogeneous deposition of inhaled radon progeny results in high local doses at the peak of the bronchial bifurcations, it was proposed earlier that hyperplasia occurs in these deposition hot spots upon chronic radon exposure. The objective of the present study is to quantify how the induction of basal cell hyperplasia modulates the microdosimetric consequences of a given radon exposure. For this purpose, computational epithelium models were constructed with spherical cell nuclei of six different cell types based on histological data. Basal cell hyperplasia was modelled by epithelium models with additional basal cells and increased epithelium thickness. Microdosimetry for alpha-particles was performed by an own-developed Monte-Carlo code. Results show that the average tissue dose, and the average hit number and dose of basal cells decrease by the increase of the measure of hyperplasia. Hit and dose distribution reveal that the induction of hyperplasia may result in a basal cell pool which is shielded from alpha-radiation. It highlights that the exposure history affects the microdosimetric consequences of a present exposure, while the biological and health effects may also depend on previous exposures. The induction of hyperplasia can be considered as a radioadaptive response at the tissue level. Such an adaptation of the tissue challenges the validity of the application of the dose and dose rate effectiveness factor from a mechanistic point of view. As the location of radiosensitive target cells may change due to previous exposures, dosimetry models considering the tissue geometry characteristic of normal conditions may be inappropriate for dose estimation in case of protracted exposures. As internal exposures are frequently chronic, such changes in tissue geometry may be highly relevant for other incorporated radionuclides.

Hence, solutions to this problem have been increasingly researched in recent years. The basic aim of this work is to examine the fissile breeding and transuranic fuel transmutation potentials of a gas cooled accelerator-driven system. In line with this purpose, firstly, the conceptually designed system is optimized by using several target materials and fuel mixtures, from the point of neutronic. Secondly, three different material compositions, namely, pure lead bismuth eutectic (LBE), LBE+natural UO2, and LBE+ 15 % enrichment UO2, are considered as target material. The target zone is separated to two sub-zones but as one within the other. The outer sub-zone is pure LBE target, and the inner sub-zone is either UO2 or pure LBE target.The UO2 target sub-zone is cooled with helium gas. Finally, the thorium dioxide mixed with transuranic dioxides, discharged from PVVR-MOX spent fuel, in pebbles composed of graphite and TRISO-coated spherical fuel particles, is used for breeding fissile fuel and transmuting transuranic fuels. Three different thorium-transuranic mixtures, (Th, Pu)O-2, (Th, Cm)O-2, (Th, Pu, MA)O-2, are examined with various mixture fractions. The packing fractions of the fuel pebbles in the transmutation core and the tristructural-isotropic coated fuel particles in a pebble are assumed as 60 % and 29 %, respectively. The transmutation core is also cooled with a high-temperature helium coolant. In order to produce high-flux neutrons that penetrate through the transmutation core, the target is exposed to the continuous beams of 1 GeV protons. The computations have been carried out with the high-energy Monte Carlo code MCNPX using the LA150 library. The numerical outcomes show that the examined accelerator-driven system has rather high neutronic data in terms of the energy production and fissile fuel breeding.

NATURAL RADIONUCLIDES IN SOIL PROFILES SURROUNDING THE LARGEST COAL-FIRED POWER PLANT IN SERBIA	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY & RADIATION PROTECTION			English	Article						natural radioactivity; gamma ray spectrometry; soil property; principal component analysis; radiological risk; dose assessment	VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; RADIOACTIVITY MEASUREMENTS; RISK-ASSESSMENT; EXPOSURE; URANIUM; CHINA; POPULATION; RADIATION; VICINITY	This study evaluates the influence of the largest Serbian coal-fired power plant on radionuclide concentrations in soil profiles up to 50 cm in depth. Thirty soil profiles were sampled from the plant surroundings (up to 10 km distance) and analyzed using standard methods for soil physicochemical properties and gamma ray spectrometry for specific activities of natural radionuclides (K-40, Ra-226 and Th-232) Spatial and vertical distribution of radionuclides was determined and analyzed to show the relations between the specific activities in the soil and soil properties and the most influential factors of natural radionuclide variability were identified. The radiological indices for surface soil were calculated and radiological risk assessment was performed. The measured specific activities were similar to values of background levels for Serbia. The sampling depth did not show any significant influence on specific activities of natural radionuclides. The strongest predictor of specific activities of the investigated radionuclides was soil granulometry. All parameters of radiological risk assessment were below the recommended values and adopted limits. It appears that the coal-fired power plant does not have a significant impact on the spatial and vertical distribution of natural radionuclides in the area of interest, but technologically enhanced natural radioactivity as a consequence of the plant operations was identified within the first 1.5 km from the power plant.

The measurements of ambient dose equivalent rate, due to radionuclides present in each of the soil samples, were performed by the RADIAGEM (TM) 2000 portable survey meter, placed on the ground and 1 m above the ground. The gamma spectrometric analysis of the same soil samples was carried out by GAMMA-RAD5 spectrometer. This study showed that there is a high correlation between the absorbed dose rate evaluated from soil radioactivity and the corresponding results obtained by the survey meter placed on the ground. Correlation analysis indicated that the survey meter, due to its narrow energy range, is not suitable for the examination of cosmic radiation contribution.

In this study, soil from a candidate very low level radioactive waste disposal site in China was evaluated for its capacity on uranium sorption. Specifically, the equilibrium time, initial concentration, soil particle, pH, temperature, and carbonate were evaluated. The results indicated that after 15-20 days of sorption, the K-d value fluctuated and stabilized at 355-360 mL/g. The adsorptive capacity of uranium was increased as the initial uranium concentration increased, while it decreased as the soil particle size increased. The pH value played an important role in the U(VI) sorption onto soil, especially under alkaline conditions, and had a great effect on the sorption capacity of soil for uranium. Moreover, the presence of carbonate decreased the sorption of U(VI) onto soil because of the role of the strong complexation of carbonate with U(VI) in the groundwater. Overall, this study assessed the behavior of U(VI) sorption onto natural soil, which would be an important factor in the geological barrier of the repository, has contribution on mastering the characteristic of the adsorption of uranium in the particular soil media for the process of very low level radioactive waste disposal.
