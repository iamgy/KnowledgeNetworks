The Fukushima Daiichi Units 1-3 lost all DC and AC power supplies, which set in motion a chain of events that led to releases of radioactivity to the environment. Since then, TEPCO has made many efforts to investigate the accident progressions and the status of the reactors and containment vessels. However, there still exist several tens of unsolved issues to be investigated for the fully understanding of the accident. In this paper, we introduce the unsolved issues related to thermal-hydraulics in the suppression chamber during the Fukushima Daiichi accident progressions. Especially, in Units 2 and 3, there are possibilities that thermal stratification inside their suppression chambers played an important role. It is important that these phenomena are addressed following both theoretical and experimental approaches as support to severe accident simulations.

J	Zhu, HL; Tong, HH; Cheng, CM				Zhu, Hailong; Tong, Honghui; Cheng, Changming			Rapid preparation of tritium breeder material Li2TiO3 pebbles by thermal plasma	NUCLEAR MATERIALS AND ENERGY			English	Article							LITHIUM-TITANATE PEBBLES; INDUCTIVELY-COUPLED PLASMA; PARTICLE-SIZE; POWDERS; SPHEROIDIZATION; FABRICATION	A route to obtain tritium breeder material Li2TiO3 pebbles in one step was investigated using a direct-current (DC) thermal plasma system. For this purpose, irregular and agglomerate powders were used as raw powders which were injected into DC thermal plasma torch with a plasma power level of similar to 18 kW. The morphology, particles size distribution and phase change of the prepared Li2TiO3 pebbles were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that prepared Li2TiO3 pebbles presented excellent spherical degree with average size about 100 mu m and the spheroidization rate was close to 100%. The XRD patterns demonstrated that higher degree of crystallinity of Li2TiO3 pebbles could be obtained by thermal plasma processed. Formation mechanism of Li2TiO3 pebbles in DC thermal plasma system was discussed. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Analysis of electronic autoradiographs by mathematical post-processing	RADIATION EFFECTS AND DEFECTS IN SOLIDS			English	Article						Autoradiography; reactor graphite; i-graphite; decontamination; radioactive waste treatment		Autoradiography is a well-established method of nuclear imaging. When different radionuclides are present simultaneously, additional processing is needed to distinguish distributions of radionuclides. In this work, a method is presented where aluminium absorbers of different thickness are used to produce images with different cutoff energies. By subtracting images pixel-by-pixel one can generate images representing certain ranges of beta-particle energies. The method is applied to the measurement of irradiated reactor graphite samples containing several radionuclides to determine the spatial distribution of these radionuclides within pre-defined energy windows. The process was repeated under fixed parameters after thermal treatment of the samples. The greyscale images of the distribution after treatment were subtracted from the corresponding pre-treatment images. Significant changes in the intensity and distribution of radionuclides could be observed in some samples. Due to the thermal treatment parameters the most significant differences were observed in the H-3 and C-14 inventory and distribution.	[Ghosh, S.; Baier, M.; Schuetz, J.; Schneider, F.; Scherer, U.

A few decades ago it was found that nuclear tracks in solids can be usefully applied for the creation of biosensors. Meanwhile quite a number of different strategies have emerged to fulfill this task which are summarized here. We ourselves have especially concentrated on the 'Product Enrichment Strategy', where the enrichment of products of a given analyte by a suitable biochemical reaction within the narrow confinement of etched ion tracks is used to amplify the product's signal for high-sensitivity biosensing. We also report on the application of nuclear analysis techniques for obtaining a deeper insight into these sensor structures, for the sake of their further optimization. Last not least we also discuss competing nanopore-based biosensing approaches.

METHODS OF INSPECTING THE RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINATION OF URANIUM-GRAPHITE REACTOR MASONRY	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								One problem of decommissioning graphite reactors is the evaluation of the radioactive contamination of the graphite. The possible methods of determining the composition, contamination, and radionuclide concentration by means of laboratory analysis of graphite samples taken from the reactor masonry are examined. It is proposed that samples of graphite powder formed during repair work performed on RBMK masonry be used. Life tests have shown that since their operational stability in neutron and gamma radiation fields is adequate CdZnTe detectors can be used to probe the channels in the reactor masonry.	[Bushuev, A.

COMPARATIVE METHOD OF CALCULATING THE THERMODYNAMIC PARAMETERS OF SOME URANIUM HEXAFLUORIDE SOLUTIONS	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								It is shown that the thermodynamics characteristics of uranium hexafluoride solutions with volatile hexa- and pentafluoride elements are a consequence of the strictly symmetric configuration of their molecular structure in the gaseous and liquid states. Simple methods are proposed for evaluating the properties of binary mixtures of elemental penta- and hexafluorides. These methods are based on a comparison of the element-fluorine bond length in the constituent molecules of system and the known enthalpy of mixing of one solution with the potential energy in the formation of a pair of unlike molecules of a different solution.

J	Jolley, K; Smith, R				Jolley, Kenny; Smith, Roger			Iron phosphate glasses: Structure determination and radiation tolerance	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Molecular dynamics; Iron phosphate glass; Radiation damage	WASTE; DAMAGE	Iron phosphate glass (IPG) has gained recent interest for use in encapsulating radioactive waste for long term storage. In this work, we investigate 5 different compositions of iron phosphate glass. We consider amorphous structures of 3 known crystalline phases: Fe2+Fe23+(P2O7)(2), Fe-4(3+)(P2O7)(3) and Fe3+(P(O-3)(3), and structures of IPG (40 mol% Fe2O3 and 60 mol% P2O5), with 4% and 17% Fe2+ ion concentrations. Using constant volume molecular dynamics (MD), we quench a set of structures for each glass composition, to find the optimal density structure. We found that the lowest energy structures of IPG with 4% and 17% concentration of Fe2+, have a density of 3.25 and 3.28 g/cm(3) respectively. This is slightly higher than the experimentally measured values of 2.9 and 2.95 g/cm(3) respectively. We also estimate an upper and lower bound on the melting temperatures of each glass, then for each glass, we simulate radiation damage cascades at 4 keV. The cascade structures can be in the form of either a concentrated thermal spike or more diffuse with sub-cascade branching. We found that the glass compositions with a higher Fe/P atomic ratio, contained a greater number of displacements after the cascade, We also found that the IPG with 4% Fe2+, contained slightly fewer displacements than the IPG with 17% Fe2+. This is consistent with our previous work, which showed that the threshold displacement energies are lower for glasses with a lower Fe2+ content. In all the simulations, many PO4 polyhedra are destroyed during the early stages of irradiation, but recover strongly over a time scale of picoseconds, leaving very few over or under co-ordinated P atoms at the end of the ballistic phase. This is in contrast to recent work in apatite. The strong recovery indicates that phosphate glasses with a low Fe2+ content could be good materials for waste encapsulation. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Anisotropic expansion and amorphization of Ga2O3 irradiated with 946 MeV Au ions	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Swift heavy ions; Ion irradiation; X-ray diffraction; Amorphization; Unit cell parameters	SWIFT HEAVY-IONS; X-RAY; THIN-FILMS; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; RADIATION-DAMAGE; BETA-GA2O3; DIFFRACTION; UO2; TRACKS	The structural response of beta-Ga2O3 to irradiation-induced electronic excitation was investigated. A polycrystalline pellet of this material was irradiated with 946 MeV Au ions and the resulting structural modifications were characterized using in situ X-ray diffraction analysis at various ion fluences, up to 1 x 10(13) cm(-2). Amorphization was induced, with the accumulation of the amorphous phase following a single-impact mechanism in which each ion produces an amorphous ion track along its path. Concurrent with this phase transformation, an increase in the unit cell volume of the material was observed and quantified using Rietveld refinement. This unit cell expansion increased as a function of ion fluence before saturating at 1.8%. This effect is attributed to the generation of defects in an ion track shell region surrounding the amorphous track cores. The unit cell parameter increase was highly anisotropic, with no observed expansion in the [010] direction. This may be due to the structure of beta-Ga2O3, which exhibits empty channels of connected interstitial sites oriented in this direction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Anomalous dispersion and band gap reduction in UO2+x and its possible coupling to the coherent polaronic quantum state	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						UO2+x; Covalency; Coherence; Band structure; XAS	X-RAY-ABSORPTION; DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; OXYGEN K-EDGE; NEUTRON-DIFFRACTION; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; URANYL-ION; OXIDES; SPECTROSCOPY; COVALENCY	Hypervalent UO2, UO2(+x) formed by both addition of excess O and photoexcitation, exhibits a number of unusual or often unique properties that point to it hosting a polaronic Bose-Einstein(-Mott) condensate. A more thorough analysis of the O X-ray absorption spectra of UO2, U4O9, and U3O7 shows that the anomalous increase in the width of the spectral features assigned to predominantly U 5f and 6d final states that points to increased dispersion of these bands occurs on the low energy side corresponding to the upper edge of the gap bordered by the conduction or upper Hubbard band. The closing of the gap by 1.5 eV is more than twice as much as predicted by calculations, consistent with the dynamical polaron found by structural measurements. In addition to fostering the excitation that is the proposed mechanism for the coherence, the likely mirroring of this effect on the occupied, valence side of the gap below the Fermi level points to increased complexity of the electronic structure that could be associated with the Fermi topology of BEC-BCS crossover and two band superconductivity.

Evolution of extended defects in polycrystalline UO2 under heavy ion irradiation: combined TEM, XRD and Raman study	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						UO2; Ion irradiations; TEM; Extended defects; XRD	X-RAY-DIFFRACTION; IN-SITU TEM; MICROSTRUCTURAL EVOLUTION; URANIUM DIOXIDE; FUELS; STRAINS; DAMAGE	A well-suited way to understand the behavior under irradiation of the UO2 nuclear fuel is to use ion implantations and further analyze the microstructure. The present work is focused on the characteristics of extended defects created by Kr implantations in UO2 polycrystals. The influence of many parameters on these extended defects has been studied separately: irradiation temperature (room temperature, 500 and 600 degrees C), ion fluence (5 x 10(15) and 1.26 x 10(17) i/cm(2)), ion energy (4 and 27 MeV) and conditions of subsequent thermal annealing. The evolution of extended defects characteristics and density was determined using transmission electron microscopy and additional damage characterizations were performed by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Results obtained by the different analytical techniques are shown to be in excellent agreement and to complement literature data. In addition, this work presents the extended defect transformation induced by fluence (dislocation loops and lines -> tangled dislocation network) and shows that temperature influences directly their evolution kinetics. Moreover we demonstrate that the temperature to allow extended defects mobility is different during irradiation and under thermal annealing conditions. Finally dislocation line density and swelling obtained from this study are found in the same order of magnitude as the ones obtained from in pile irradiations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, in UO2 thin foils irradiated with energetic ions at room temperature, a nano-void population whose size distribution reaches a similar steady state can be observed, although quasi no foreign atoms are implanted nor significant cation vacancy diffusion expected in conditions. Atomistic simulations performed at low temperature only address the first stage of the process, supporting the assumption of void heterogeneous nucleation: 25 keV sub-cascades directly produce defect aggregates (loops and voids) even in the absence of gas atoms and thermal diffusion. In this work a semi empirical stochastic model is proposed to enlarge the time scale covered by simulation up to damage levels where every point in the material undergoes the superposition of a large number of sub-cascade impacts. To account for the accumulation of these impacts, simple rules inferred from the atomistic simulation results are used. The model satisfactorily reproduces the TEM observations of nano-voids size and concentration, which paves the way for the introduction of a more realistic damage term in rate theory models.

Charged defects during alpha-irradiation of actinide oxides as revealed by Raman and luminescence spectroscopy	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Alpha irradiation; Raman signature; Luminescence; Electronic defects	URANIUM-DIOXIDE; THORIUM-DIOXIDE; UO2; CONDUCTIVITY; RADIATION; BEHAVIOR; CENTERS; DAMAGE; IONS	We have recently evidenced an original Raman signature of alpha irradiation-induced defects in UO2. In this study, we aim to determine whether the same signature also exists in different actinide oxides, namely ThO2 and PuO2. Sintered UO2 and ThO2 were initially irradiated with 21 MeV He2+ ions using a cyclotron device and were subjected to an in situ luminescence experiment followed by Raman analysis. In addition, a PuO2 sample which had accumulated self-irradiation damage due to alpha particles was investigated only by Raman measurement. Results obtained for the initially white ThO2 showed that a blue color appeared in the irradiated areas as well as luminescence signals during irradiation. However, Raman spectroscopic analysis showed the absence of Raman signature in ThO2. In contrast, the irradiated UO2 and PuO2 confirmed the presence of the Raman signature but no luminescence peaks were observed. The proposed mechanism involves electronic defects in ThO2, while a coupling between electronic defects and phonons is required to explain the Raman spectra for UO2 and PuO2. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In the framework of European projects, it has been shown that the use of refractory targets with nanometric structure allows us to obtain beams of nuclei unreachable until now. The first parameter to be controlled in the processing to obtain targets with a homogeneous nanostructure is the grinding of uranium dioxide, down to 100 nm grain size. In this study, dry and wet grinding routes are studied and the powders are analyzed in terms of phase stabilization, specific surface area and grain morphology. It appears that the grinding, as well dry as wet, leads to the decrease of the particle size. The oxidation of UO2 is observed whatever the grinding. However, the dry grinding is the most efficient and leads to the oxidation of UO2 into U4O9 and U3O7 whose quantities increase with the grinding time while crystallite sizes decrease.

The behavior of stoichiometric (U,Pu)O-2 compounds is relatively well understood, but the effects of oxygen stoichiometry on the fuel performance and stability are often still obscure. In the present work, a series of laser melting experiments were carried out to determine the impact of an oxidizing atmosphere, and in consequence the departure from a stoichiometric composition on the melting behavior of six mixed uranium plutonium oxides with Pu content ranging from 14 to 62 wt%. The starting materials were disks cut from sintered stoichiometric pellets. For each composition we have performed two laser melting experiments in pressurized air, each consisting of four shots of different duration and intensity. During the experiments we recorded the temperature at the surface of the sample with a pyrometer. Phase transitions were qualitatively identified with the help of a reflected blue laser. The observed phase transitions occur at a systematically lower temperature, the lower the Pu content of the studied sample. It is consistent with the fact that uranium dioxide is easily oxidized at elevated temperatures, forming chemical species rich in oxygen, which melt at a lower temperature and are more volatile. To our knowledge this campaign is a first attempt to quantitatively determine the effect of O/M on the melting temperature of MOX. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In preparation for thorium-loaded ADS experiments, renewed irradiation experiments are conducted with small and thin foils of thorium in the critical state to reevaluate the accuracy of the experimental analyses. In the ADS experiments, reactor physics parameters are found to be different in the same core when the external neutron source is injected separately with 14-MeV neutrons and spallation neutrons. By comparing with the calculated results, the significant impact of external neutron sources on the neutron characteristics of ADS is obtained in both the static and the kinetic experimental analyses.

Analysis of Multiple TRIGA-Based Molybdenum Production Reactor Cores Using a New Low-Enriched Uranium Target as Fuel	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Molybdenum-99; low-enriched uranium; reactor analysis		The most widely used and versatile medical radioisotope today is Tc-99m. Roughly 30 million people depend on this radioisotope for diagnostic imaging procedures each year, and this demand is expected to grow. Although there are numerous ways of producing this isotope, the most common is from fission product Mo-99, which is produced in all nuclear reactors fueled with U-235 as a fission fragment with a yield of around 6.1%. Molybdenum-99 has a half-life of just over 2.5 days, and it will decay to Tc-99m 87% of the time. The Reduced Enrichment for Research Test Reactors program was established at Argonne National Laboratory in 1978 to investigate technology that would aid in converting highly enriched uranium (HEU) facilities to low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel. Since the majority of all Mo-99 produced currently comes from the irradiation of HEU fuel targets, there has been a growing effort to design LEU targets that can yield comparable quantities of high specific activity Mo-99. Recently, a novel LEU target design has been developed for use in TRIGA reactors for the production of Mo-99. The simulation tool MCNP5 was used to examine the neutronic behavior of multiple core configurations fueled solely with this new target.

Thorium Fuel Cycle Option Screening in the United States	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	GLOBAL 2013 International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Conference	SEP 29-OCT 03, 2013	Salt Lake City, UT			Thorium; fuel cycle; evaluation and screening		As part of a nuclear fuel cycle evaluation and screening (E&S) study, widely ranging thorium fuel cycle options were evaluated, and their performance characteristics and challenges to implementation were compared to those of other nuclear fuel cycle options based on criteria specified by the Nuclear Energy Office of the U.S. Department of Energy. The evaluated nuclear fuel cycles included the once-through, limited, and continuous recycle options using critical or externally driven nuclear energy systems. The E&S study found that the continuous recycle of U-233/Th in fuel cycles using either thermal or fast reactors is an attractive promising fuel cycle option with high effective fuel resource utilization and low waste generation, but they did not perform quite as well as the continuous recycle of Pu/U using a fast critical system, which was identified as one of the most promising fuel cycle options in the E&S study. This is because compared to their uranium counterparts, the thorium-based systems tended to have higher radioactivity in the short term (similar to 100 years postirradiation), because of differences in the fission product yield curves, and in the long term (100 000 years postirradiation), because of the decay of U-233 and daughters, and because of higher mass flow rates due to lower discharge burnups. Some of the thorium-based systems also require enriched uranium support, which tends to be detrimental to resource utilization and waste generation metrics. Finally, similar to the need to develop recycle fuel fabrication, fuels separations, and fast reactors for the most promising options using Pu/U recycle, the future thorium-based fuel cycle options with continuous recycle would also require such capabilities; however, their deployment challenges are expected to be greater since past development of such facilities has not reached a comparable level of maturity.

Thorium is frequently found within rare earth element bearing minerals that exist in diverse types of mineral deposits, often in conjunction with other minerals mined for their commercial value. It may be possible to recover substantial quantities of thorium as a by-product from active titanium, uranium, tin, iron, and rare earth mines. Incremental physical and chemical processing is required to obtain a purified thorium product from thorium minerals, but documented experience with these processes is extensive, and incorporating thorium recovery should not be overly challenging. The anticipated environmental impacts of by-product thorium recovery are small relative to those of uranium recovery since existing mining infrastructure utilization avoids the opening and operation of new mines and thorium recovery removes radionuclides from the mining tailings.

Liquid Fuel Molten Salt Reactors for Thorium Utilization	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	GLOBAL 2013 International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Conference	SEP 29-OCT 03, 2013	Salt Lake City, UT			Molten salt reactors; thorium fuel cycle; MSBR		Molten salt reactors (MSRs) represent a class of reactors that use liquid salt, usually fluoride based or chloride based, as either a coolant with a solid fuel (such as fluoride salt cooled high-temperature reactors) or as a combined coolant and fuel with the fuel dissolved in a carrier salt. For liquid-fueled MSRs, the salt can be processed online or in a batch mode to allow for removal of fission products as well as for introduction of fissile fuel and fertile materials during reactor operation. The MSR is most commonly associated with the U-233/thorium fuel cycle, as the nuclear properties of U-233 combined with the online removal of parasitic absorbers enable the design of a thermal-spectrum breeder reactor. However, MSR concepts have been developed using all neutron energy spectra (thermal, intermediate, fast, and mixed spectrum zoned concepts) and with a variety of fuels including uranium, thorium, plutonium, and minor actinides. Early MSR work was supported by a significant research and development (R&D) program that resulted in two experimental systems operating at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1950s and 1960s: the Aircraft Reactor Experiment and the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment. Subsequent design studies in the 1970s focusing on thermal-spectrum thorium-fueled systems established reference concepts for two major design variants: (1) a molten salt breeder reactor (MSBR) with multiple configurations that could breed additional fissile material or maintain self-sustaining operation and (2) a denatured molten salt reactor (DMSR) with enhanced proliferation resistance. MSRs have been selected as one of the Generation IV systems, and development activity has been seen in fast-spectrum MSRs, waste-burning MSRs, and MSRs fueled with low-enriched uranium as well as in more traditional thorium fuel cycle based MSRs. This paper provides a historical background of MSR R&D efforts, surveys and summarizes many of the recent developments, and provides analysis comparing thorium-based MSRs by way of example.

Various scenarios exist for utilization of thorium in the nuclear fuel cycle, including use in different nuclear reactor types (e.g., light water, high-temperature gas-cooled, fast spectrum sodium, and molten salt reactors), along with use in advanced accelerator-driven systems and even in fission-fusion hybrid systems. The most likely near-term application of thorium in the United States is in currently operating light water reactors (LWRs). This use is primarily based on concepts that mix thorium with uranium (UO2 + ThO2) or that add fertile thorium (ThO2) fuel pins to typical LWR fuel assemblies. Utilization of mixed fuel assemblies (PuO2 + ThO2) is also possible. The addition of thorium to currently operating LWRs would result in a number of different phenomenological impacts to the nuclear fuel. Thorium and its irradiation products have different nuclear characteristics from those of uranium and its irradiation products. ThO2, alone or mixed with UO2 fuel, leads to different chemical and physical properties of the fuel. These key reactor safety related issues have been studied at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and documented in "Safety and Regulatory Issues of the Thorium Fuel Cycle" (NUREG/CR-7176, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 2014). Various reactor analyses were performed using the SCALE code system for comparison of key performance parameters of both ThO2 + UO2 and ThO2 + PuO2 against those of UO2 and typical UO2 + PuO2 mixed oxide fuels, including reactivity coefficients and power sharing between surrounding UO2 assemblies and the assembly of interest. The decay heat and radiological source terms for spent fuel after its discharge from the reactor are also presented. Based on this evaluation, potential impacts on safety requirements and identification of knowledge gaps that require additional analysis or research to develop a technical basis for the licensing of thorium fuel are idengfied.

Simulations of a Pressure-Tube Heavy Water Reactor Operating on Near-Breeding Thorium Cycles	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	GLOBAL 2013 International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Conference	SEP 29-OCT 03, 2013	Salt Lake City, UT			Heavy water reactor; thorium; DONJON		The pressure-tube heavy water reactor (PT-HWR) has excellent potential as an operational technology to exploit the use of thorium. Reactor core configurations of an existing PT-HWR design with thorium-based fuels were simulated using the DRAGON/DONJON reactor physics code suite. The ultimate goal of this work was to achieve a self-sufficient equilibrium thorium cycle with a fissile inventory ratio (FIR) greater than unity (FIR >= 1.0) by altering the fueling configuration and leaving the reactor model relatively unchanged from the existing 700-MW(electric)-class PT-HWR design. A further constraint was the license requirements limiting the maximum channel and bundle powers of existing PT-HWRs. To improve the breeding potential in the PT-HWR, heterogeneous seed and blanket core configurations were selected for assessment as opposed to using a homogenous core configuration with one single type of fuel. A number of bundle design concepts were modeled with DRAGON: A 24-element variant of the internally cooled annular fuel bundle was chosen for the seed fuel, and a conventional 28-element bundle was used for the blanket fuel. Two annular heterogeneous core configurations were considered: inner seed outer blanket (ISOB) and inner blanket outer seed (IBOS). Time-average and instantaneous power calculations were performed using DONJON It was found that while the ISOB configuration could attain net breeding (FIR >= 1.0), the maximum channel and bundle powers exceeded the defined limits. When the reactor was derated to reduce these powers, the fuel cycle fell just below net breeding, although it did have a very high FIR. The IBOS configuration could meet the power limits without derating but was not self-sufficient. Despite not being net breeders, the FIR in both cases was very close to unity (0.986 to 0.995). Work is continuing to further optimize the fuel bundle concepts and core configurations and to achieve net breeding. Overall, the PT-HWR shows great promise for the current-generation implementation of the thorium fuel cycle.

Multiregion Annular Heterogeneous Core Concepts for Plutonium-Thorium Fuels in Pressure-Tube Heavy Water Reactors	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	GLOBAL 2013 International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Conference	SEP 29-OCT 03, 2013	Salt Lake City, UT			Heavy water; thorium; heterogeneous		Pressure-tube heavy water reactors (PT-HWRs) are highly advantageous for implementing plutonium-thorium (Pu-Th) fuels because of their high neutron economy and online refueling capability. The use of annular heterogeneous seed-blanket core concepts in a PT-HWR where higher-fissile-content seed fuel bundles are physically separate from lower-fissile-content blanket bundles allows more flexibility and control in fuel management. The lattice concept modeled was a 35-element bundle made with a homogeneous mixture of reactor-grade PuO2 (similar to 67 wt% fissile) and ThO2, with a central zirconia rod to reduce coolant void reactivity. Eight annular heterogeneous seed-blanket core concepts with plutonium-thorium based fuels in a 700-MW(electric)-class PT HWR were analyzed, using a once-through-thorium cycle. Blanket region(s) represented 50% to 75% of the total fuel volume. There were 1, 2, and 3 different blanket regions and 1, 2, and 3 different seed regions. The seed fuel tested was 3 wt% or 4 wt% PuO2, while the blanket fuel tested was 1 wt% PuO2, mixed with ThO2. The impact of different fuel combinations on the core-average burnup, fissile utilization (FU), power distributions, and other performance parameters were evaluated. WIMS-AECL 3.1 was used to perform lattice physics calculations using two-dimensional, 89-group integral neutron transport theory, while RFSP 3.5.1 was used to perform the core physics and fuel management calculations using three-dimensional two-group diffusion theory. Among the different core concepts investigated, there were cores where the FU was up to 25% higher than is achieved in a PT-HWR using natural uranium fuel bundles. There were cores where up to 60% of the Pu was consumed, cores where up to 41% of the energy was produced from U-233, and cores where up to 236 kg/yr of fissile uranium (mainly U-233) was produced in the discharged fuel. This study is an extension of previous work that involved the analysis of homogeneous cores, two-region (one seed, one blanket) and eight-region (four seeds, four blankets) annular, and checkerboard-type heterogeneous seed-blanket cores.

Steady State and Accident Transient Analysis Burning Weapons-Grade Plutonium in Thorium and Uranium with Silicon Carbide Cladding	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	GLOBAL 2013 International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Conference	SEP 29-OCT 03, 2013	Salt Lake City, UT			Thorium; plutonium burning; silicon carbide		A comparison of burning weapons-grade plutonium in a standard pressurized water reactor (PWR) using thoria or urania as a fuel matrix has been performed. Two cladding options were considered: a silicon carbide (SiC) matrix of 0.76-mm thickness and Zircaloy of 0.57-mm thickness. As expected, in terms of percentage and total plutonium mass burned, there was a large benefit in using thoria as a matrix compared to urania. Additionally, a smaller amount of plutonium is required in a core when SiC is the cladding because of lower neutron absorption in SiC. The thorium system was also better from a plutonium burning viewpoint. It resulted in less weapons-useable U and Pu at discharge and more burned over an assembly's lifetime. At discharge, the fuel was shown to have lower multiples of minimum amounts needed for weapons, even when U-233 breeding was taken into account. Thoria-plutonia fuel has different kinetic characteristics from urania-plutonia or enriched urania fuel, so a limited safety comparison of such fuels was made for two reactivity insertion accidents: (1) the highest worth rod ejection and (2) main-steam-line break (MSLB). The accident analyses were performed at both beginning and end of cycle. While the control rod worths are higher in the simulated thoria-plutonia and urania-plutonia cores than in conventional urania-loaded cores, the enthalpy added during the accident was lower than current safety limits for conventional cores. During the MSLB accident, all cases showed acceptable behavior, indicating that the less negative moderator temperature coefficients of thoria-plutonia and urania-plutonia fuel were not limiting.

Axial uranium and thorium blankets are introduced in thorium- and uranium-based driver fueled burner cores to improve TRU burning rates without considerable increases of burnup reactivity swing. For this core configuration, it was shown that cores using thorium and depleted uranium blankets can be designed to have a high TRU burning rate, a low sodium void reactivity (SVR) worth, and a low burnup reactivity swing. In particular, the use of uranium or thorium blankets without recycling in the thorium-based driver fueled cores led to significant reductions of burnup reactivity swing with considerable increases of the TRU burning rate and small increases of SVR. In addition, the core configuration having central nonfuel regions was considered to show the effects of the thorium-based driver metallic fuel versus the uranium-based metallic fuel coupled with moderator rods. The core configuration with thorium-based fuel led to a negative SVR without moderator rods, and the use of moderator rods further improved the Doppler coefficient and reduced SVR. Also, a decomposition analysis of SVR was peiformed to better understand the differences in the contributing factors between the uranium- and thorium-based fueled cores, and a quasi-static reactivity balance analysis was performed to show the inherent safety of the cores in terms of self-controllability.

Both accelerator-driven systems (ADSs) and fusion driven systems have been proposed. This paper highlights key literature related to the use of thorium in externally driven systems (EDSs) and builds upon this foundation to identify potential roles for EDSs in thorium fuel cycles. In fuel cycles with natural thorium feed and no enrichment, the potential roles are (1) a once-through breed-and-burn fuel cycle and (2) a fissile breeder (mainly U-233) to support a fleet of critical reactors. If enriched uranium is used in the fuel cycle in addition to thorium, EDSs may be used to burn transuranic material. These fuel cycles were evaluated in the recently completed U.S. Department of Energy Evaluation and Screening of nuclear fuel cycle options relative to the current once-through commercial nuclear fuel cycle in the United States. The evaluation was performed with respect to nine specified high-level criteria, such as waste management and resource utilization. Each of these fuel cycles presents significant potential benefits per unit energy generation compared to the present once-through uranium fuel cycle. A parametric study indicates that fusion-fission hybrid systems per form better than ADSs in some missions due to a higher neutron source relative to the energy required to produce it. However, both potential externally driven technology choices face significant development and deployment challenges. In addition, there are significant challenges associated with the use of thorium fuel and with the transition from a uranium-based fuel cycle to a thorium-based fuel cycle.

ORNL Experience and Perspectives Related to Processing of Thorium and U-233 for Nuclear Fuel	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	GLOBAL 2013 International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Conference	SEP 29-OCT 03, 2013	Salt Lake City, UT			Thorium; U-233; reprocessing	DISSOLUTION; CONVERSION; URANIUM	Thorium-based nuclear fuel cycles have received renewed attention in both research and public circles since about the year 2000. Much of the attention has been focused on nuclear fission energy production that utilizes thorium as a fertile element for producing fissionable U-233 for recycle in thermal reactors, fast reactors, or externally driven systems. Lesser attention has been paid to other fuel cycle operations that are necessary for implementation of a sustainable thorium-based fuel cycle such as reprocessing and fabrication of recycle fuels containing U-233. This paper first identifies recent literature that has resulted from the renewed interest in thorium-based fuel cycles. Next, differences in the radiation characteristics of nuclear materials associated with thorium based and uranium-based fuels are discussed, and the generic implications of the differences to nuclear material processing are identified. Then, experience at Oak Ridge National Laboratory concerning processing of thorium and U-233 is described in terms of the processing projects and campaigns undertaken and the facilities in which the processing was implemented. This experience then provides the basis for a generalized discussion of processing nuclear materials associated with thorium-based fuel cycles as compared to uranium-based fuel cycles. This comparative discussion focuses on key out-of-reactor fuel cycle operations: reprocessing of metal-clad oxide and graphite-matrix oxide used nuclear fuels (UNFs) including head-end processing (shearing and dissolution), solvent extraction, product conversion, fuel fabrication, and waste management. It is concluded that the recycle of thorium-based UNF constituents (U-233 and thorium) is more technically challenging than the recycle of uranium-based UNF constituents (plutonium and uranium) based on the radiation, chemical, and physical characteristics of nuclear materials in thorium-based fuel cycles as compared to uranium-based fuel cycles.

Comparative Assessment of Thorium Fuel Cycle Radiotoxicity	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	GLOBAL 2013 International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Conference	SEP 29-OCT 03, 2013	Salt Lake City, UT			Thorium; spent nuclear fuel; radiotoxicity		This paper compares the radiotoxicity of thorium-based and uranium-based spent nuclear fuels and reprocessing wastes to inform evaluation of whether thorium-based fuels are significantly less radio toxic than uranium-based fuels, as has been claimed at times in the technical literature. A consistent approach for calculating the radiotoxicity is established for four oxide fuel types in a pressurized water reactor: low-enrichment uranium, uranium with plutonium fissile material, thorium with U-233 fissile material, and thorium with plutonium fissile material. The results of the calculations are presented to display the radiotoxicity trends and are analyzed to determine (a) what underlies the indicated radiotoxicity trends for decay times from 1 year to 20 million years and (b) factors that may have led to erroneous conclusions concerning the comparative radiotoxicity of thorium- and uranium-based fuels. The overall conclusion is that the ingestion radiotoxicity of thorium-based fuels containing U-233 or plutonium fissile materials is similar to the radiotoxicity of uranium-based fuels containing U-235 or plutonium fissile materials but that within this overall similarity there are significant differences in radiotoxicity in specific eras during decay.

Safeguards Considerations for Thorium Fuel Cycles	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	GLOBAL 2013 International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Conference	SEP 29-OCT 03, 2013	Salt Lake City, UT			Safeguards; nondestructive assay; uranium-233		By around 2025, thorium-based fuel cycles are likely to be deployed internationally. States such as China and India are pursuing research, development, and deployment pathways toward a number of commercial-scale thorium fuel cycles, and they are already building test reactors and the associated fuel cycle infrastructure. In the future, the potential exists for these emerging programs to sell, export, and deploy thorium fuel cycle technology in other states. Without technically adequate international safeguards protocols and measures in place, any future potential clandestine misuse of these fuel cycles could go undetected, compromising the deterrent value of these protocols and measures. The development of safeguards approaches for thorium-based fuel cycles is therefore a matter of some urgency. Yet, the focus of the international safeguards community remains mainly on safeguarding conventional U-235- and (PU)-P-239-based fuel cycles while the safeguards challenges of thorium-uranium fuel cycles remain largely uninvestigated. This raises the following question: Is the International Atomic Energy Agency and international safeguards system ready for thorium fuel cycles? Furthermore, is the safeguards technology of today sufficiently mature to meet the verification challenges posed by thorium-based fuel cycles? In defining these and other related research questions, the objectives of this paper are to identify key safeguards considerations for thorium-based fuel cycles and to call for an early dialogue between the international safeguards and the nuclear fuel cycle communities to prepare for the potential safeguards challenges associated with these fuel cycles. In this paper, it is concluded that directed research and development programs are required to meet the identified safeguards challenges and to take timely action in preparation for the international deployment of thorium fuel cycles.

Proton irradiation of thorium generates a number of.. emitting radionuclides with therapeutic potential for application via TAT. In particular, the radionuclide 230 Pa is formed via the Th-232(p, 3n) nuclear reaction and partially decays to U-230, an alpha emitter which has recently received attention as a possible therapy nuclide. In this study, we estimate production yields for Pa-230 and other Pa isotopes from proton-irradiated thorium based on cross section measurements. We adopt existing methods for the chromatographic separation of protactinium isotopes from proton irradiated thorium matrices to combine and optimize them for effective fission product decontamination.

Experimental determination of proton induced reaction cross sections on Ni-nat near threshold energy	RADIOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Ni-nat target; cross sections; tandem accelerator; BC 1710 cyclotron; 5 MeV and 16.7 MeV protons	PARTICLE INDUCED REACTIONS; INDUCED NUCLEAR-REACTIONS; HIGHLY ENRICHED NI-58; EXCITATION-FUNCTIONS; SMALL CYCLOTRON; NATURAL NICKEL; ACTIVITY CU-64; NI-64; ACTIVATION; COPPER-61	A newly developed facility at the 3 MV Tandem Accelerator at Dhaka for measurement of proton induced reaction cross sections in the energy region below 5 MeV is outlined and tests for the beam characterization are described. The results were validated by comparison with the well-known excitation function of the Ni-64(p, n)Cu-64 reaction. Excitation functions of the reactions Ni-nat(p, x)Cu-60,Cu-61, Ni-nat(p, x)Co-55,Co-57,Co-58m+g and Ni-nat(p, x)Ni-57 were also measured from threshold to 16 MeV using the stacked-foil technique, whereby irradiations were performed with 5 MeV protons available at the Tandem Accelerator and 16.7 MeV protons at the BC 1710 cyclotron at Julich, Germany. The radioactivity was measured using HPGe gamma-ray detectors. A few results are new, the others strengthen the database. In particular, the results of the reaction Ni-nat(p, x)Cu-61 below 3 MeV could serve as beam monitor.

Within these experiments, two analytical assays of uranium were comparatively tested: a fast and improved fluorimetric assay and the classical colorimetric (U(IV)-arsenazo(III) complexation) one. During the germination, the wheat seeds and plantlets supported well the uranium solutions of treatment within the entire concentration range (1 x 10(-4) -5 x 10(-3) M). Uranium proved to be non (radio) toxic to wheat as compared with other natural and anthropogenic radiocations, probably because its uptake by spring wheat during the germination is low. Indeed, only a small fraction of uranium administered was located within the roots, whereas the uranium content of the stems was negligible. A high correlation between the results obtained by two analytical methods was found. However, the fluorimetric assay proved to be more reliable and fast, and accurate.

The analyzed magnesium pharmaceutics contained organic or inorganicmagnesium compounds; some from natural sources. The objectives of this research were to investigate the naturally occurring Po-210 activity concentrations in magnesium supplements, find the correlations between Po-210 concentration in medicament and magnesium chemical form, and calculate the effective radiation dose connected to analyzed magnesium supplement consumption. The highest Po-210 activity concentrations were determined in mineral tablets made from sedimentary rocks, namely dolomite -3.84 +/- 0.15 mBq g(-1) (sample Mg17). The highest annual radiation dose from Po-210 taken with 1 tablet of magnesium supplement per day or with 400 mg of pure Mg daily would come from sample Mg17 (dolomite) - 1.35 +/-+/- 0.5 and 8.44 +/- 0.33 mu Sv year(-1) respectively.

J	Chen, HL; Pan, L; Lv, ZL; Li, W; Zeng, Q				Chen, Hongli; Pan, Lei; Lv, Zhongliang; Li, Wei; Zeng, Qin			Tritium fuel cycle modeling and tritium breeding analysis for CFETR	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						Tritium self-sufficiency; Tritium fuel cycle; Tritium inventory; CFETR	FUSION-REACTORS; INVENTORY; SYSTEM	Attaining tritium self-sufficiency is a critical goal for fusion reactor operated on the D-T fuel cycle. The tritium fuel cycle models were developed to describe the characteristic parameters of the various elements of the tritium cycle as a tool for evaluating the tritium breeding requirements. In this paper, a modified tritium fuel cycle model with more detailed subsystems and an updated mean residence time calculation method was developed based on ITER tritium model. The tritium inventory in fueling system and in plasma, supposed to be important for part of the initial startup tritium inventory, was considered in the updated mean residence time method. Based on the model, the tritium fuel cycle analysis of CFETR (Chinese Fusion Engineering Testing Reactor) was carried out. The most important two parameters, the minimum initial startup tritium inventory (I-m) and the minimum tritium breeding ratio (TBRreq) were calculated. The tritium inventories in steady state and tritium release of subsystems were obtained. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Valcea	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						Cryogenic; Distillation; Hydrogen; Isotopes		Cryogenic distillation (CD) of hydrogen in combination with Liquid Phase Catalytic Exchange (LACE) or Combined Electrolytic Catalytic Exchange (CECE) process is used for tritium removal/recovery from tritiated water. Tritiated water is being obtained after long time operation of CANDU reactors, or in case of ITER mainly by the Detritiation System (DS). The cryogenic distillation system (CDS) used to remove/recover tritium from a hydrogen stream consists of a cascade of cryogenic distillation columns and a refrigeration unit which provides the cooling capacity for the condensers of CD columns. The columns, together with the condensers and the process heat-exchangers are accommodated in a vacuumed cold box. In the particularly case of the ICIT Plant, the cryogenic distillation cascade consists of four columns with diameters between 100-7 mm and it has been designed to process up to 10 mc/h of tritiated deuterium. This paper will present the steps undertaken for construction and commissioning of a pilot plant for tritium removal/recovery by cryogenic distillation of hydrogen. The paper will show besides preliminary data obtained during commissioning, also general characteristics of the plant and its equipments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An accurate calibration for the 14 MeV neutron yield monitors is necessary. In order to perform the calibration a 14 MeV Neutron Generator with suitable intensity (similar to 10(8) n/s) will be used. Due to the intensity change during the Neutron Generator lifetime it would be necessary to monitor continuously the neutron emission intensity during the calibration using a compact detector attached to it. A high quality diamond detector has been chosen as one of the monitors. This detector has been fully characterized at the 14 MeV Frascati Neutron Generator facility. The characterization procedure and the resulting 14 MeV neutron response of the detector are described in this paper together with the obtained uncertainties. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Thermal modeling of a vertical dry storage cask for used nuclear fuel	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							CONVECTION HEAT-TRANSFER; NATURAL-CONVECTION; CANISTER	Thermal modeling of temperature profiles of dry casks has been identified as a high-priority item in a U.S. Department of Energy gap analysis. In this work, a three-dimensional model of a vertical dry cask has been constructed for computer simulation by using the ANSYS/FLUENT code. The vertical storage cask contains a welded canister for 32 Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) used-fuel assemblies with a total decay heat load of 34 kW. To simplify thermal calculations, an effective thermal conductivity model for a 17 x 17 PWR used (or spent)-fuel assembly was developed and used in the simulation of thermal performance. The effects of canister fill gas (helium or nitrogen), internal pressure (1-6 atm), and basket material (stainless steel or aluminum alloy) were studied to determine the peak cladding temperature (PCT) and the canister surface temperatures (CSTs). The results showed that high thermal conductivity of the basket material greatly enhances heat transfer and reduces the PCT. The results also showed that natural convection affects both PCT and the CST profile, while the latter depends strongly on the type of fill gas and canister internal pressure. Of particular interest to condition and performance monitoring is the identification of canister locations where significant temperature change occurs after a canister is breached and the fill gas changes from high-pressure helium to ambient air. This study provided insight on the thermal performance of a vertical storage cask containing high-burnup fuel, and helped advance the concept of monitoring CSTs as a means to detect helium leakage from a welded canister. The effects of blockage of air inlet vents on the cask's thermal performance were studied. The simulation were validated by comparing the results against data obtained from the temperature measurements of a commercial cask. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Stanisz, P; Oettingen, M; Cetnar, J				Stanisz, Przemyslaw; Oettingen, Mikolaj; Cetnar, Jerzy			Monte Carlo modeling of Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor in adiabatic equilibrium state	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							CORE DESIGN; ELSY; ENERGY	Nuclear power would appear to be the only energy source able to satisfy the global energy demand while also achieving a significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, it can provide a stable and secure source of electricity, and plays an important role in many European countries. However, nuclear power generation from its birth has been doomed by the legacy of radioactive nuclear waste. In addition, the looming decrease in the available resources of fissile U235 may influence the future sustainability of nuclear energy. The integrated solution to both problems is not trivial, and postulates the introduction of a closed-fuel cycle strategy based on breeder reactors. The perfect choice of a novel reactor system fulfilling both requirements is the Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor operating in the adiabatic equilibrium state. In such a state, the reactor converts depleted or natural uranium into plutonium while consuming any self-generated minor actinides and transferring only fission products as waste. We present the preliminary design of a Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor operating in the adiabatic equilibrium state with the Monte Carlo Continuous Energy Burnup Code-MCB. As a reference reactor model we apply the core design developed initially under the framework of the European Lead-cooled SYstem (ELSY) project and refined in the follow-up Lead-cooled European Advanced DEmonstration Reactor (LEADER) project. The major objective of the study is to show to what extent the constraints of the adiabatic cycle are maintained and to indicate the phase space for further improvements. The analysis includes burnup calculations in a two-batch fuel reloading pattern, assessment of the equilibrium fuel composition based on MOX with minor actinides, examination of power peaking with its evolution with burnup, and modeling of control rod operation for its influence on breeding gain and criticality.

Development of a thermal-mechanical behavior coupling analysis code for a dual-cooled annular fuel element in PWRs	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							FISSION-GAS RELEASE; PRESSURIZED-WATER REACTORS; LWR UO2 FUEL; MODEL	In this study, a series of mathematical and physical models, mainly including thermal-hydraulic, mechanical, material property calculation and burnup effect models, for the dual-cooled annular fuel element were established. With the consideration of burnup effects, a thermal-mechanical behavior analysis code FROBA-ANNULAR (Fuel Rod Behavior Analysis-ANNULAR) for I&E cooled annular fuel elements was independently developed. To validate the accuracy and reliability of this code, the thermal, mechanical and fission gas release calculation results were compared with that obtained by FRAPCON-ANNULAR code, which was developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The FROBA-ANNULAR was applied to analyze the fuel performance of a reference sintered I&E annular fuel element during the fuel life time. The key physical parameters at different burnup stages were obtained, including the radial power distribution, the temperature contour of fuel element, stress and strain of cladding and geometric sizes of fuel element. The calculation result shows that the substantial heat split phenomenon may occur due to the inconsistent geometric size changes of inner and outer gap caused by the pellet and cladding deformations, which results in significant asymmetry in heat transfer. In addition, the compute result indicates that the mechanical deformation of cladding increased rapidly with the burnup when the gap was closed as a result of the pellet and cladding mechanical interaction (PCMI), which may cause mechanical failure at high burnup and power level.

In Slovakia, the decommissioning of A1 NPP is very specific case because A1 NPP is rare type of NPP (prototype) and furthermore its operation was affected by the accident. A large number of specific non-standard radioactive waste, such as long-time storage cases (hereinafter LSC), that is not usually present within the decommissioning projects of NPP with a regular termination of operation, represent one of the significant consequences of the accident and issues arisen from follow-up activities. The presented article describes the proposal of processing and conditioning of non-standard radioactive waste ( such as LSC), together with description of methodology applied in the proposal for update of waste acceptance criteria for the processing and conditioning of radioactive waste (hereinafter RAW) within Bohunice Radioactive waste Treatment and Conditioning Centre (hereinafter RWTC). The results of performed detailed analysis are summarized into new waste acceptance criteria for technological lines keeping in mind safety principles and requirements for protection of operating personnel, the public and the environment.

J	Stempniewicz, MM				Stempniewicz, M. M.			Air oxidation of Zircaloy, Part 1-Review of correlations	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							INGRESS; SCDAPSIM3.5; DEGRADATION; SIMULATION; NITROGEN; TESTS	The accident in Fukushima brought up new issues in the area of safety of nuclear reactors. Among others, Spent Fuel Pool accidents gained new focus. The computer codes applicable for safety analyses of Nuclear Power Plants have limited verification and validation in this area and their applicability remains still to be proven. An important phenomenon occurring during loss of water in SFP is air oxidation of Zircaloy cladding material. Mathematical modeling of this phenomenon in computer codes has been under development during the last years. This document presents a review of models for air oxidation of Zircaloy alloys, including up to date models available in open literature, as well as models available in computer codes ASTEC and MELCOR. The models were tested by performing simulations of a number air oxidation experiments from ANL, KIT, and IRSN. It was found out that the ASTEC model gives somewhat better agreement with data than the MELCOR model for the ANL and KIT experiments. The reaction rates from the MELCOR model differ from experiments by factor of 2 and 3 respectively. In case of IRSN tests, the MELCOR model gives better agreement with data. The reaction rates from the ASTEC model differ from experiment by roughly a factor of 3. The difference between the reaction rates predicted by the models and obtained from experiments was found to be up to about factor of three. The ASTEC model gives generally qualitatively better representation of reality. A disadvantage is the use of Boase and Vandergraaf correlation outside its validity range (T> 1000 K) where it is underestimating the reaction rate. In the MELCOR model the following qualitative behavior is incorrect: breakaway occurs in the entire temperature range, while experiments show that it occurs only for temperatures below about 1050 degrees C; post-breakaway reaction is parabolic, while experiments show linear reaction rate. It is concluded that the air oxidation models exist in the available codes but the accuracy of the models could be improved. Improvement of mathematical modeling of air oxidation is currently ongoing in various institutes, for example the PSI model in MELCOR and SCDAPSim code (Birchley and Fernandez-Moguel, 2012; Fernandez-Moguel, 2015), IRSN and GRS model, including modeling of the nitride itself in the ATHLET code (Hollands, 2007). An attempt to improve accuracy by providing a consistent set of correlations for a full temperatures range and pre- and post-breakaway regimes is a subject of the Part 2 of this paper.

J	Stempniewicz, MM				Stempniewicz, M. M.			Air oxidation of Zircaloy, Part 2: New model for Zry-4 oxidation	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							HIGH-TEMPERATURE OXIDATION; INGRESS; DEGRADATION; SIMULATION; STEAM	The accident in Fukushima brought up new issues in the area of safety of nuclear reactors. Among others, Spent Fuel Pool accidents gained new focus. The computer codes applicable for safety analyses of Nuclear Power Plants have limited verification and validation in this area and their applicability remains still to be proven. An important phenomenon occurring during loss of water in SFP is air oxidation of Zircaloy cladding material. Mathematical modeling of this phenomenon in computer codes has been under development during the last years. This document presents a review of models for air oxidation of Zircaloy, including: up to date models available in open literature, as well as models available in computer codes: ASTEC, MELCOR, and SPECTRA. The models were tested by performing simulations of a number air oxidation experiments from ANL, KIT, and IRSN. As a result of this work, a recommended set of correlations, applicable for wide range of temperatures, including pre- and post-breakaway reaction, has been selected. For the pre-breakaway (parabolic) regime the correlation of Benjamin et al. (Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, 1979) was selected for the low temperatures and a new correlation has been proposed for the high temperatures. For the post breakaway (linear) regime, Boase and Vandergraaf (Nucl. Technol., 1977;32:60-71) were selected for the low temperatures and a new correlation has been proposed for the high temperatures. Furthermore, a new model for the breakaway transition has been proposed. The correlation set is applicable for Zircaloy-4, for practically the entire temperature range. The recommended set provides an improved accuracy of results compared to previous models. The current model is applicable to any situation where air oxidation of Zircaloy may occur, for example loss of water in a Spent Fuel Pool. The model recommended in this paper is applicable only for Zircaloy-4. Concerning two other Zr-based alloys, Zirlo (TM) and M5 (R), reaction rate coefficients exist in literature, however the existing models are not sufficient to calculate oxidation of these materials with satisfactory accuracy. Breakaway models, specific for these materials, do not exist and should be developed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Stempniewicz, M.

In this work, the Gd1-xCexPo4 (0 <= x <= 1) series is synthesized via conventional solid state reaction using Ce as the surrogate for minor actinide americium (Am), with microstructure/phase structure characterized by XRD, HRTEM, mu-Raman, and SEM as well. The optimized temperature for preparation of monazite-type Gd0.4Ce0.6PO4 solid solution is more than 1300 degrees C. At 1400 degrees C, the GdPO4 ceramic is essentially monazite with little metastable xenotime phase. The metastable xenotime (GdPO4) to monazite transformation occurs during the immobilizing phase of Ce element. The formation of monazite-type Gd1-xCexPO4 solid solutions in the range 0.1 <= x <= 1 is confirmed by the Rietveld refinement and Raman spectra. The change of Ce content has no significant influence on the morphology of the monazite-type Gd1-xCexPO4 compounds. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The PoFASS consists of a robot arm with a vent line, a robot body equipped with a radioactive filter, and a robot suction nozzle that is the shape of a hand with fingers. By controlling the angle of the robot fingers on the robot suction nozzle, it can change its own shape to completely adapt to cover the damaged sections found in NPPs, and consequently, radioactive release to the atmosphere is effectively prevented. Surveying all the possible shapes of damaged sections in non-containment structures, six distinctive cases were identified. The minimum number of robot fingers that can cover all six cases of damaged sections was mathematically determined to be four, but in the design of the suction nozzle, six robot fingers were included to take into consideration the extension limit of the extensible cover of the suction nozzle as well as the area to be covered at the damaged sections. A complete mathematical model was developed to validate the covering capacity of the designed suction nozzle for all six cases. The minimum number of robot arm rods to access to any damaged section in NPPs was also determined to be three; hence, the PoFASS can access the hatch door of a containment buildings or the damaged sections of containment buildings, turbine buildings, and auxiliary buildings in NPPs. Experimental verification for the proposed PoFASS was successfully done with a prototype suction nozzle for the six cases of damaged sections. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Analysis of actinide recycling in a Boiling Water Reactor using CASMO-4/SIMULATE-3	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Actinide recycling; BWR recycling; BWR depleted fuel		Final disposition of spent nuclear fuel in a permanent repository is still on debate; meanwhile the stockpile of depleted fuel is increasing. Actinide recycling has the potential to reduce that stockpile. This study analyzes the potential to burn actinide from depleted fuel in a thermal reactor without reducing the nominal electricity generation of the reactor and. meeting all the safety constraints. The study takes an equilibrium cycle of a Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) as the reference cycle and then it proposes the design of an equivalent fuel assembly in which 4 fuel rods are replaced by minor actinide-bearing rods, the process ends when the equilibrium cycle is met. The new BWR fuel assembly design, that is called MA-c, has the goal to maximize the actinide recycling while introducing the lowest perturbation possible to the control and safety systems of the reactor. MA-c is successful, according to our analysis. The performance of the core is analyzed using MA-c and it is compared against the UO2 reference core, results show that both of these cores produce the same amount of energy for an 18-month cycle. The MA-c fuel assembly has a higher enrichment than the UO2 reference fuel assembly to compensate for the use of four MA-bearing rods, however all the fuel pins inside the MA-c fuel assembly have enrichments below 5 w/o of U-235. The MA-c core met all the safety BWR constraints without modifying any of the control systems. Results for a BWR with a nominal power of 2027 MWt show a reduction of 135.30 kg HM of minor actinide per 18-month operating cycle when the whole core is composed of "once-through" MA-c fuel assemblies. The use of this new BWR fuel assembly design can be used effectively for the reduction of minor actinide without the need of control systems modification in the reactor to meet safety limits and without affecting the energy production.

A neutronic analysis for the full core reactor was performed by using MCNP5 with ENDF/B-VI cross-section library. Different mixture ratios were tested in order to find the appropriate mixture ratio of fertile and fissile fuel particles that gives a comparable k(eff) value of the reference uranium fuel. Time dependent calculations were performed by using MONTEBURN2.0 with ORIGEN2.2 for each selected mixture. Different parameters (operation time, burnup value, fissile isotope change, etc.) were subject of performance comparison. The operation time and burnup values were close to each other with nat-U and thorium, namely 3205 days and 176 GWd/MTU for the former and 3175 days 181 GWd/MTU for the latter fertile fuel. In addition, the fissile isotope amount changed from initially 6940.1 kg-4579.2 kg at the end of its operation time for nat-U. These values were obtained for thorium as 6603.3 kg-4250.2 kg, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
