Experiments at JET with its ITER-like wall and using a D-T plasma mixture will help to mitigate risks in the ITER research plan. Training of the ITER operators, technicians and engineers at JET will safe valuable time when ITER comes into operation. Moreover, the way in which the future ITER experiments will be organized can already be experienced at JET, by imposing a similar organisational structure. This paper will present arguments in favour of an extension of JET and additionally briefly discuss a number of enhancements that will make experiments on JET even more relevant for ITER.	[Donne, A.

J	Rydl, A; Lind, T; Birchley, J				Rydl, Adolf; Lind, Terttaliisa; Birchley, Jonathan			Integral analyses of fission product retention at mitigated thermally-induced SGTR using ARTIST experimental data	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							SEVERE ACCIDENT; ENTRAINMENT	Integral source-term analyses are performed using MELCOR for a PWR Station Blackout (SBO) sequence leading to induced steam generator tube rupture (SGTR). In the absence of any mitigation measures, such a sequence can result in a containment bypass where the radioactive materials can be released directly to the environment. In some SGTR scenarios flooding of the faulted SG secondary side with water can mitigate the accident escalation and also the release of aerosol-borne and volatile radioactive materials. Data on the efficiency of aerosol scrubbing in an SG tube bundle were obtained in the international ARTIST project. In this paper ARTIST data are used directly with parametric MELCOR analyses of a mitigated SGTR sequence to provide more realistic estimates of the releases to environment in such a type of scenario or similar. Comparison is made with predictions using the default scrubbing model in MELCOR, as a representative of the aerosol scrubbing models in current integral codes. Specifically, simulations are performed for an unmitigated sequence and 2 cases where the SG secondary was refilled at different times after the tube rupture. The results, reflecting the experimental observations from ARTIST, demonstrate enhanced aerosol retention in the highly turbulent two-phase flow conditions caused by the complex geometry of the SG secondary side. This effect is not captured by any of the models currently available. The underlying physics remains only partly understood, indicating need for further studies to support a more mechanistic treatment of the retention process. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Development of ORIGEN libraries for mixed oxide (MOX) fuel assembly designs	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							ANALYSIS CAPABILITIES; NUCLEAR-DATA; SCALE 6; TECHNOLOGY; VALIDATION; DEPLETION; SCIENCE	ORIGEN cross section libraries for reactor-grade mixed oxide (MOX) fuel assembly designs have been developed to provide fast and accurate depletion calculations to predict nuclide inventories, radiation sources and thermal decay heat information needed in safety evaluations and safeguards verification measurements of spent nuclear fuel. These ORIGEN libraries are generated using two-dimensional lattice physics assembly models that include enrichment zoning and cross section data based on ENDF/B-VII.O evaluations. Using the SCALE depletion sequence, burnup-dependent cross sections are created for selected commercial reactor assembly designs and a representative range of reactor operating conditions, fuel enrichments, and fuel burnup. The burnup dependent cross sections are then interpolated to provide problem-dependent cross sections for ORIGEN, avoiding the need for time-consuming lattice physics calculations. The ORIGEN libraries for MOX assembly designs are validated against destructive radiochemical assay measurements of MOX fuel from the MALIBU international experimental program. This program included measurements of MOX fuel from a 15 x 15 pressurized water reactor assembly and a 9 x 9 boiling water reactor assembly. The ORIGEN MOX libraries are also compared against detailed assembly calculations from the Phase IV-B numerical MOX fuel burnup credit benchmark coordinated by the Nuclear Energy Agency within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The nuclide compositions calculated by ORIGEN using the MOX libraries are shown to be in good agreement with other physics codes and with experimental data. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Experimental investigations on turbulent mixing of hot upward flow and cold downward flow inside a chimney model of a nuclear reactor	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							OPPOSING JETS; JUNCTION	Experiments were conducted to study the turbulent mixing of hot upward flow and cold downward flow inside a scaled down model of chimney structure of a pool type nuclear research reactor. Open pool type nuclear reactors often use this type of chimney structures to prevent mixing of radioactive core outlet water directly into the reactor pool so that radiation field at the reactor pool top can be kept to a lower limit. The chimney structure is designed to facilitate guiding of the radioactive water towards the two outlet nozzles of the chimney and simultaneously allows drawing water from the reactor pool through the chimney top opening. The present work aims at studying flow mixing behaviour of hot and cold water inside a 2/9th scaled down model of the chimney structure experimentally. The ratio between the cold downward flow and the hot upward flow is varied between 0 and 0.15 to predict the extent of suppression of the hot upward flow within the chimney region for various bypass flow ratios. The Reynolds number of the hot upward flow considered in the experiment is about 1.5 x 10(5) which corresponds to a flow rate of about 500 l min(-1). The upward jet height and the temperature distribution were predicted from the experiment. It was observed that increase in bypass flow ratio reduces the upward jet height of hot water. Experiments were also carried out by increasing the flow rate to 1000 and 1500 l min(-1) corresponding to Reynolds numbers of 3 x 10(5) and 4.5 x 10(5), respectively. It was observed that the jet height did not vary significantly with changing upward flow rate provided the bypass flow ratio was held constant. Experiments were also done by increasing the chimney height from 500 mm to 600 mm and no significant change in mixing behaviour of the hot and cold water was observed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Nuclear Safety of an RBMK Spent Fuel Pool	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								Aspects of the nuclear safety of the spent fuel pools of RMBK reactors under normal conditions and design basis and beyond design basis accidents are studied using a three-dimensional model verified by comparing with Monte Carlo calculations. It is shown that the storage of spent fuel assemblies in pencil-shaped cases secures nuclear safety in the entire range of water density, lattice spacing, and fuel burnup, i.e., in all, including hypothetical, emergency situations. For compact case-free storage, nuclear safety is secured in real scenarios where the water density changes upon disruption of heat removal or flooding of a dewatered pool. The disruption of the lattice spacing of compact storage in design basis, including seismic action, and beyond design basis accidents is examined. The conditions under which nuclear safety is secured are shown.	[Davydova, G. B.; Zakharova, L. N.; Fedosov, A.

Gamma-Spectrometric Determination of the Plutonium Mass in Containers	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								A method is proposed for determining the mass and isotopic composition of the plutonium warehoused in containers at the RT-1 plant of the Industrial Association Mayak. A single measurement system with a detector based on ultrapure germanium is used for the measurements. The mass is determined according to the pulse count rate in Pu-239 peaks. The correction for self-absorption of radiation in a container is determined by measuring the transmission of radiation emitted from an external source and by Monte Carlo calculations. Estimates show that the total error in determining the plutonium mass by the new method is 11% (P = 0.95). The method can be used to perform confirmatory measurements in the accounting and control system for nuclear materials.	[Aleeva, T. B.; Bushuev, A. V.; Kozhin, A. F.; Zubarev, V. N.; Verenchikova, M.

Verification of Benchmark Experiments by Determination of the Leakage Neutron Spectrum from the Surface of a Depleted Uranium Sphere with Embedded Radionuclide Sources	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								Computational validation is presented for previous benchmark experiments designed to determine the energy spectra of the neutron current emanating from the surface of a uranium sphere into which small sources were arranged successively at the center. Such experiments must meet stringent reliability and error requirements, since they are intended for the final check of new or adjusted systems of neutron constants recommended for the calculation of neutron fields. The comprehensiveness of the validation was secured by the fact that experiments with the three sources Cf-252, Pu-Be, and Pu-B were validated and the calculations were performed using three systems of neutron constants BNAB-78, BBF, and BUGLE-96.

Irradiation Dose Minimization by Optimizing the Arrangement of Radiation Sources of Different Intensity	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								A method of decreasing the irradiation dose rate from spent nuclear fuel or radwaste containers arranged on open storage sites or in hangar-type repositories has been developed. The dose rate is minimized by optimizing the arrangement of radiation sources of different intensities. It is shown that for a fixed number of sources the minimum dose rate at a given distance from a row of containers is reached for a definite arrangement in terms of intensity. The arrangement of the containers on the storage site and in a light hangar-type repository is determined using the particularities of the radiation emanating from the containers for dry storage of spent nuclear fuel and containers for conditioned radioactive wastes.

The results show that even if the maximum temperature limit at the interface between the canister surface and the surrounding buffer is elevated from 100 degrees C to 125 degrees C, there is no significant influence on the integrity of the canister and the buffer. This elevation of the maximum temperature limit can improve the disposal density by about double, and contribute greatly to finding a suitable site for a spent fuel repository. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Kim, TH; Jeong, JH				Kim, Tae Hyeon; Jeong, Ji Hwan			Evaluation method of iodine re-evolution from an in-containment water pool after a loss of coolant accident, Part II: Evaluation of pH and iodine re-evolution	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						pH; Iodine re-evolution; LOCA; IRWST; CFD	PHASE; LOCA	Radioactive iodine that is released during a postulated loss of coolant accident is dissolved into the containment spray water and transported into the in-containment refueling water storage tank (IRWST). The re-evolution of iodine from the water is a safety concern. In this study, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses are conducted in order to analyze the transport of chemical species including iodine in the IRWST and to calculate the amount of iodine that re-evolves from the IRWST water. The CFD analyses demonstrate that the pH of water is high where the iodine concentration is high. Considering that the creation rate of molecular iodine declines as the pH increases, it can be understood that the iodine re-evolution is not so strong in practical situations because the chemical conditions of the iodine-rich region suppress the re-evolution of the iodine. In addition, four different methods for evaluating the amount of re-evolved iodine are examined. The amount of re-evolved iodine calculated using the total-volume-average values, which are currently used for safety analyses, appear to be significantly higher than those determined using other methods. The amount of re-evolved iodine estimated using a realistic method with a conservative assumption of volatilization appears to be approximately one thousandth of that evaluated using the current method. This implies that the current method is very conservative. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The tritium concentration in the primary helium gas increased after startup and peaked at 1.6 x 10(-1) Bq/cm(3) (STP) at 60% reactor power. Then, it decreased slightly over the course of the normal operation phase. This decrease could be attributed to the effect of tritium chemisorption on graphite. The tritium concentration in the secondary helium gas was slightly lower than that in the primary helium gas. The tritium concentration in the secondary helium gas peaked at 4.7 x 10(-2) Bq/cm(3) (STP) during the power enhancement phase. Thereafter, it decreased gradually to 2.2 x 10(-2) Bq/cm(3) (STP) at the end of the normal power operation phase. As assessed herein, the concentration and total quantity of tritium in the secondary helium cooling system of the HTTR-iodine sulfur (IS) system can be maintained below the regulatory limits, which implies that the hydrogen production plant can be exempt from the safety function of the nuclear facility.

Validation of the minimalistic Nodal Drift Method for spatial kinetics on a simple CANDU LOCA benchmark	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Nodal Drift Method; Spatial kinetics; Diffusion theory; CANDU LOCA; MCNP/MURE; Thorium fuel cycle	REACTOR KINETICS; MONTE-CARLO	The recently developed Nodal Drift Method (NDM) provides easy spatial kinetics with a view to broad and coarse safety studies of some promising thorium-fueled High Conversion Water Reactor (HCWR) options. It fills a gap between the extremes of rather loose approximate point kinetics and rather tightly defined and too sophisticated industrial schemes. NDM is based on the 2-group diffusion theory and a lumped parameter model with maximized mesh size. It is validated here on an elementary CANDU-like LOCA benchmark proposed by AECL in the seventies. Chosen for its model simplicity, this design transient allows one to describe NDM principles and to carefully check the accuracy without any need for thermal calculations. Thus precise modeling of the strong coupling between neutronics and thermal-hydraulics is deferred for further developments, and simplified within this framework. Based on a simple transposition of the benchmark, a first application of NDM assesses safety of CANDU with "Th" fuel (Th/U-233 oxide) compared to "NU" (Natural Uranium oxide). (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Choe, J; Shin, HC; Lee, D				Choe, Jiwon; Shin, Ho Cheol; Lee, Deokjung			New burnable absorber for long-cycle low boron operation of PWRs	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Gd-157; Er-167; Burnable absorber; Fuel cycle; PWR fuel assembly; PWR type reactor	SYSTEM	This paper presents a new high performance burnable absorber (BA) design for advanced Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) aiming for a long-cycle operation with a low soluble boron concentration. The new BA consists of a UO2-(Gd2O3)-Gd-157 rod covered with a thin layer of (ZrEr2)-Er-167. A key feature of this new BA is that enriched isotopes, Gd-157 and Er-167, are used as absorber materials. Since the high absorption cross section of Gd-157 can reduce the mass fraction of Gd2O3 in UO2-Gd2O3, the thermal margin of fuel rods will increase with higher heat conductivity. Also, the Gd-157 transmutes into Gd-158 by neutron absorption and therefore the residual penalty at the end of cycle (EOC) will decrease. Since Er-167 has a resonance near the thermal neutron energy region, the moderator temperature coefficient (MTC) will become more negative and the control rod worth will increase. These advantages of the new BA are demonstrated with three verification cases: a 17 x 17 Westinghouse (WH) type fuel assembly, a 16 x 16 Combustion Engineering (CE) type fuel assembly, and an OPR-1000 equilibrium core.

J	Kase, KR				Kase, Kenneth R.			TWELFTH ANNUAL WARREN K. SINCLAIR KEYNOTE ADDRESS-THE INFLUENCE OF THE NCRP ON RADIATION PROTECTION IN THE UNITED STATES: GUIDANCE AND REGULATION	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements; radiation protection; regulations; safety standards	STANDARDS; HISTORY	The Warren K. Sinclair Keynote Address for the 2015 Annual Meeting of the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) describes the Council's influence in the development of radiation protection guidance in the United States since its founding in 1929 as the U.S. Advisory Committee on X-Ray and Radium Protection. The National Bureau of Standards (NBS) was the coordinating agency for the Advisory Committee, and its reports were published as NBS handbooks. In 1946, the Advisory Committee was renamed the National Committee on Radiation Protection and remained so until NCRP was chartered by the U.S. Congress in 1964. In 1931, the U.S. Advisory Committee on X-Ray and Radium Protection proposed the first formal standard for protecting people from radiation sources as NBS Handbook 15 and issued the first handbook on radium protection, NBS Handbook 18. Revised recommendations for external exposure were issued in 1936 and for radium protection in 1938 and remained in force until 1948. Throughout its 86 y history, the Council and its predecessors have functioned as effective advisors to the nation on radiation protection issues and have provided the fundamental guidance and recommendations necessary for the regulatory basis of the control of radiation exposure, radiation-producing devices, and radioactive materials in the United States.

ENHANCED RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL SOURCE SECURITY	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements; radiation damage; radioactive materials; waste management		Requirements for additional security measures for sealed radioactive sources have evolved since they were first implemented after the terrorist events of 11 September 2001. This paper will describe the sequence of those measures, commencing with the early orders issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to the May 2013 adoption of 10 CFR Part 37, Physical Protections of Category 1 and Category 2 Quantities of Radioactive Material. Part 37 requirements will be discussed in detail, as the 37 NRC Agreement States, which regulate approximately 88% of the radioactive material licensees, will be required to enact by 19 March 2016. In addition to the Part 37 requirements, the paper will also highlight some of the other ongoing efforts of the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration's Global Threat Reduction Initiative and the Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors.

J	Pryor, KH				Pryor, Kathryn H.			END OF LIFE DECISIONS FOR SEALED RADIOACTIVE SOURCES	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements; radioactive materials; waste management; waste storage	RECYCLED METALS	Sealed radioactive sources are encountered in a wide variety of settingsfrom household smoke detectors and instrument check sources through fixed industrial gauges, industrial radiography, and well logging sources, to irradiators and medical teletherapy devices. In general, the higher the level of activity in the sealed source, the stricter the regulatory control that is applied to its use, control, and ultimate disposition. Lower levels of attention and oversight can and do lead to sources ending up in the wrong placeas orphan sources in uncontrolled storage, disposed in a sanitary landfill, melted down in metal recycling operations and incorporated into consumer products, or handled by an unsuspecting member of the public. There is a range of issues that contribute to the problem of improper disposal of sealed sources and, in particular, to disused source disposal. Generally licensed sources and devices are particularly at risk of being disposed incorrectly. Higher activity generally licensed sources, although required to be registered with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) or an Agreement State, receive limited regulatory oversight and are not tracked on a national scale. Users frequently do not consider the full life-cycle costs when procuring sources or devices and discover that they cannot afford and/or are unwilling to pay the associated costs to package, transport and dispose of their sources properly. The NRC requirements for decommissioning funding plans and financial assurance are not adequate to cover sealed source transport and disposal costs fully. While there are regulatory limits for storage of disused sources, enforcement is limited, and there are only limited financial incentives in a small number of states for owners to dispose of the sources. In some cases, the lack of availability of approved Type B shipping casks presents an additional barrier to sealed source disposal. The report of the Disused Sources Working Group does an excellent job of framing these issues (www.disusedsources.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/DSWG-Report-March-2014.pdf). This article reviews both the issues and the report's recommendations, which are designed to improve sealed source control and encourage proper disposal of disused sources.

J	DeCair, S				DeCair, Sara			UPDATING DOSIMETRY FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE DOSE PROJECTIONS	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements; dosimetry; emergency planning; emergencies; radiological		In 2013, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed an update to the 1992 Protective Action Guides (PAG) Manual. The PAG Manual provides guidance to state and local officials planning for radiological emergencies. EPA requested public comment on the proposed revisions, while making them available for interim use by officials faced with an emergency situation. Developed with interagency partners, EPA's proposal incorporates newer dosimetric methods, identifies tools and guidelines developed since the current document was issued, and extends the scope of the PAGs to all significant radiological incidents, including radiological dispersal devices or improvised nuclear devices. In order to best serve the emergency management community, scientific policy direction had to be set on how to use International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication 60 age groups in dose assessment when implementing emergency guidelines. Certain guidelines that lend themselves to different PAGs for different subpopulations are the PAGs for potassium iodide (KI), food, and water. These guidelines provide age-specific recommendations because of the radiosensitivity of the thyroid and young children with respect to ingestion and inhalation doses in particular. Taking protective actions like using KI, avoiding certain foods or using alternative sources of drinking water can be relatively simple to implement by the parents of young children. Clear public messages can convey which age groups should take which action, unlike how an evacuation or relocation order should apply to entire households or neighborhoods. New in the PAG Manual is planning guidance for the late phase of an incident, after the situation is stabilized and efforts turn toward recovery. Because the late phase can take years to complete, decision makers are faced with managing public exposures in areas not fully remediated. The proposal includes quick-reference operational guidelines to inform re-entry to the contaminated zone. Broad guidance on approaches to wide-area cleanup and cleanup goals is also provided. EPA adapted the cleanup process from the 2008 U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Planning Guidance for Protection and Recovery Following Radiological Dispersal Device (RDD) and Improvised Nuclear Device (IND) Incidents, and the final PAG Manual will supersede that DHS guidance. Waste management guidance is also provided. Recognizing that an incident could result in radioactive waste volumes that severely strain or exceed available resources and capacity, officials may consider alternatives for disposal of waste that is relatively lightly contaminated. Waste management, including treatment, staging, and interim and long-term storage, must be an integral part of recovery.

An alarm from a Continuous Air Monitor caused a switch from unfiltered to filtered air exiting the facility through High-Efficiency Particulate Arrestance filters. The activity measured on the filters demonstrated first order decay, indicating that the release was a single release. The facility was reentered in April 2014 and photographic evidence pointed to a single breached 55-gallon drum that originated at Los Alamos as the source of the release. Data were collected and analyzed to verify the source and cause of the release.

J	Wilson, CA; Matthews, K; Pulsipher, A; Wang, WH				Wilson, Charles A.; Matthews, Kennith; Pulsipher, Allan; Wang, Wei-Hsung			Using Geographic Information Systems to Determine Site Suitability for a Low-Level Radioactive Waste Storage Facility	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topics; waste disposal; waste storage; waste; low-level		Radioactive waste is an inevitable product of using radioactive material in education and research activities, medical applications, energy generation, and weapons production. Low-level radioactive waste (LLW) makes up a majority of the radioactive waste produced in the United States. In 2010, over two million cubic feet of LLW were shipped to disposal sites. Despite efforts from several states and compacts as well as from private industry, the options for proper disposal of LLW remain limited. New methods for quickly identifying potential storage locations could alleviate current challenges and eventually provide additional sites and allow for adequate regional disposal of LLW. Furthermore, these methods need to be designed so that they are easily communicated to the public. A Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based method was developed to determine suitability of potential LLW disposal (or storage) sites. Criteria and other parameters of suitability were based on the Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) requirements as well as supporting literature and reports. The resultant method was used to assess areas suitable for further evaluation as prospective disposal sites in Louisiana. Criteria were derived from the 10 minimum requirements in 10 CFR Part 61.50, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Regulatory Guide 0902, and studies at existing disposal sites. A suitability formula was developed permitting the use of weighting factors and normalization of all criteria. Data were compiled into GIS data sets and analyzed on a cell grid of approximately 14,000 cells (covering 181,300 square kilometers) using the suitability formula. Requirements were analyzed for each cell using multiple criteria/sub-criteria as well as surrogates for unavailable datasets. Additional criteria were also added when appropriate. The method designed in this project proved to be sufficient for initial screening tests in determining the most suitable areas for prospective disposal (or storage) sites. Cells above 90%, 95%, and 99% suitability include respectively 404, 88, and 4 cells suitable for further analysis. With these areas identified, the next step in siting a LLW storage facility would be on-site analysis using additional requirements as specified by relevant regulatory guidelines. The GIS based method provides an easy, economic, efficient and effective means in evaluating potential sites for LLW storage facilities where sufficient GIS data exist.

The reliable results could be obtained by introducing the angular correction factor to correct the G-factor with respect to incident photons distributed in a certain range of angles. The intercomparison results of radioactivity using ISOCS software, an analysis of a sample taken from the soil around a detector, and dose rate spectroscopy had a difference of < 20% for Pb-214, Bi-214, Ac-228, Bi-212, Tl-208, and K-40, except for Pb-212 with low-energy photons, that is, < 300 key. In addition, the drawback of using dose rate spectroscopy, that is, all gamma rays from a nuclide should be identified to accurately assess the individual dose rate, was overcome by adopting the concept of contribution ratio of the key gamma ray to the individual dose rate of a nuclide, so that it could be accurately calculated by identifying only a key gamma ray from a nuclide.

The discussed filters include a novel, nonlinear correction method for ballistic deficits, which is combined with one of three shaping filters: a pseudoGaussian, a modified trapezoidal, or a modified cusp filter. The performance of the filters is demonstrated with a 762 g Broad Energy Germanium (BEGe) detector, produced by Canberra, that measures 7-ray lines from radioactive sources in an energy range between 59.5 and 2614.5 keV. At 1332.5 keV, together with the ballistic deficit correction method, all filters produce a comparable energy resolution of 1.61 keV FVVHM. This value is superior to those measured by the manufacturer and those found in publications with detectors of a similar design and mass. At 59.5 keV, the modified cusp filter without a ballistic deficit correction produced the best result, with an energy resolution of 0.46 keV. It is observed that the loss in resolution by using a constant shaping time over the entire energy range is small when using the ballistic deficit correction method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Dissolution rates of aggregated montmorillonite samples in basic solutions at room temperature were investigated in flow-through experiments by using internal refraction interferometry with an enhanced phase-shift interferometry. Conventional solution analysis methods cannot measure the effects of dissolution occurring within the interlayer of montmorillonite. Internal refraction interferometry can measure the crystal dissolution of montmorillonite, including both the dissolution of the outer surface and the interlayer of montmorillonite. The dissolution rate of montmorillonite in the interlayer was first observed. It was slower than the dissolution rate of outer surface. As the number of the montmorillonite crystal laminations increased, the montmorillonite dissolution rate in the interlayer decreased. Montmorillonite dissolution rates showed limited dependence on pH in the alkaline solutions. This can be explained by the effect of the laminated structure of montmorillonite crystal on the dissolution rate, especially in highly alkaline solution.

In this work, Li2TiO3 pebbles with a narrow size distribution, high density, small grain size, and good sphericity are synthesized using the commercial Li2TiO3 powder as the raw material by a co-flow capillary-based microfluidic wet process. Highly uniform slurry droplets containing Li2TiO3 powder and polyvinyl alcohol were formed in the microfluidic device and then solidified with the cross-linking reaction between polyvinyl alcohol and borax. Li2TiO3 pebbles were finally obtained after sintering the green bodies. The size of sintered Li2TiO3 pebbles with a good sphericity (D-max/D-min < 1.05) can be controlled precisely in a size range of 400-1000 mu m by adjusting the flow rate of disperse and continuous phases. The effects of the calcination method, sintering condition, solid content of slurry, and the particle size of Li2TiO3 powder on the relative density of Li2TiO3 pebbles prepared were studied in detail, and 97.16% T.D.

The change in concentration of dissolved uranium and hydrogen peroxide from uranyl peroxide, the form of the dissolved uranium species, and the change in morphology of dissolved uranyl peroxide were investigated for 100 or more days. Uranyl peroxide was stable in distilled water at elevated temperatures, but dissolved in other solutions at temperatures higher than 40 degrees C; a greater amount of uranyl peroxide dissolved in more acidic conditions at elevated temperatures. Uranyl ions that dissolved from uranyl peroxide were able to be recovered as uranyl peroxide in the solution where the dissolution occurs by adding hydrogen peroxide. After the precipitation of uranyl peroxide, the uranyl concentration in the supernatant is low enough for the supernatant to be recycled or released into the environment. The morphologies of the partially dissolved uranyl peroxide and the re-precipitated uranyl peroxide from dissolved uranyl ions were different from that of the initial uranyl peroxide.

The recent advent of radioactive beams has resulted in a plethora of new, continuously flowing, experimental data on nuclear structure - including nuclear moments - which hinders the information management. A new, dedicated, public and user friendly online database (http://rnagneticmomenis.info) has been created comprising experimental data of nuclear electromagnetic moments. The present database super-sedes existing printed compilations, including also non-evaluated series of data and relevant meta-data, while putting strong emphasis on bimonthly updates.

J	Caruso, S				Caruso, Stefano			Estimation of the radionuclide inventory in LWR spent fuel assembly structural materials for long-term safety analysis	EPJ NUCLEAR SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article								The radionuclide inventory of materials irradiated in a reactor depends on the initial material composition, irradiation history and on the magnitude and spectrum of the neutron flux. The material composition of a fuel assembly structure includes various alloys of Zircaloy, Inconel and stainless steel. The existing impurities in these materials are very important for accurate determination of the activation of all nuclides with a view to assessing the radiological consequences of their geological disposal. In fact, the safety assessments of geological repositories require the average and maximum (in the sense of very conservative) inventories of the very long-lived nuclides as input. The purpose of the present work is to describe the methodology applied for determining the activation of these nuclides in fuel assembly structural materials by means of coupled depletion/activation calculations and also to crosscheck the results obtained from two approaches. UO2 and MOX PWR fuels have been simulated using SCALE/TRITON, simultaneously irradiating the fuel region in POWER mode and the cladding region in FLUX mode and aiming to produce binary macro cross-section libraries by applying accurate local neutron spectra in the cladding region as a function of irradiation history that are suitable for activation calculations. The developed activation libraries have been re-employed in a second run using the ORIGEN-S program for a dedicated activation calculation. The axial variation of the neutron flux along the fuel assembly length has also been considered. The SCALE calculations were performed using a 238-group cross-section library, according to the ENDF/B-VII. The results obtained with the ORIGEN-S activation calculations are compared with the results obtained from TRITON via direct irradiation of the cladding, as allowed by the FLUX mode. It is shown that an agreement on the total calculated activities can be found within 55% for MOX and within 22% for UO2, whereas the latter is reduced to 9% when more accurate irradiation data are used (core-follow flux data instead of life-average flux data).

The goals of this project focused on developing viable non-destructive assay techniques with capabilities to improve an independent verification of spent fuel assembly characteristics. For this purpose, the CIPN instrument combines active and passive neutron interrogation, along with passive gamma-ray measurements, to provide three independent observables. This paper describes the initial feasibility demonstration of the CIPN instrument, which involved measurements of four pressurized-water-reactor spent fuel assemblies with different levels of burnup and two initial enrichments. The measurements were performed at the Post-Irradiation Examination Facility at the Korea Atomic Energy Institute in the Republic of Korea. The key aim of the demonstration was to evaluate CIPN instrument performance under realistic deployment conditions, with the focus on a detailed assessment of systematic uncertainties that are best evaluated experimentally. The measurements revealed good positioning reproducibility, as well as a high degree of insensitivity of the CIPN instrument's response to irregularities in a radial burnup profile. Systematic uncertainty of individual CIPN instrument signals due to assembly rotation was found to be < 4.5%, even for assemblies with fairly extreme gradients in the radial burnup profile. These features suggest that the CIPN instrument is capable of providing a good representation of assembly average characteristics, independent of assembly orientation in the instrument.

The ion source of the RFT-30 cyclotron creates plasma from hydrogen gas and transports an ion beam into the center region of the cyclotron. Ion source control is used to search source parameters for best quality of the ion beam. Ion source control in a real system is a difficult and time consuming task, and the operator should search the source parameters by manipulating the cyclotron directly. In this paper, we propose an artificial neural network based predictive control approach for the RFT-30 ion source. The proposed approach constructs the ion source model by using an artificial neural network and finds the optimized parameters with the simulated annealing algorithm. To analyze the performance of the proposed approach, we evaluated the simulations with the experimental data of the ion source. The performance results show that the proposed approach can provide an efficient way to analyze and control the ion source of the RFT-30 cyclotron. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The dedicated beam line for radiation damage studies comprises: (1) beam diagnosis and focusing optical components, (2) a scanning and slit system that allows uniform irradiation of a sample area of 0.5-6 cm(2), and (3) a sample stage designed to be able to monitor in-situ the sample temperature, current deposited on the sample, and the gamma spectrum of potential radio-active nuclides produced during the sample irradiation. The beam line capabilities have been tested by irradiating a 20Cr-25Ni-Nb stabilised stainless steel with a 3 MeV proton beam to a dose level of 3 dpa. The irradiation temperature was 356 degrees C, with a maximum range in temperature values of +/- 6 degrees C within the first 24 h of continuous irradiation. The sample stage is connected to ground through an electrometer to measure accurately the charge deposited on the sample. The charge can be integrated in hardware during irradiation, and this methodology removes uncertainties due to fluctuations in beam current. The measured gamma spectrum allowed the identification of the main radioactive nuclides produced during the proton bombardment from the lifetimes and gamma emissions. This dedicated radiation damage beam line is hosted by the Dalton Cumbrian Facility of the University of Manchester. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Wady, P.

AGATA consists of highly segmented high-purity germanium crystals and uses the pulse-shape analysis technique to determine both the position and the energy of the y-ray interaction points in the crystals. It is the tracking algorithms that deploy this information and enable insight into the sequence of interactions, providing information on the full or partial absorption of the 7 ray. A series of dedicated performance measurements for an AGATA set-up comprising 21 crystals is described. This set-up was used within the recent PreSPEC-AGATA experimental campaign at the GSI Helmholtzzentrum fur Schwerionenforschung. Using the radioactive sources Co-56, Co-60 and Eu-152, absolute and normalized efficiencies and the peak-to-total of the array were measured. These quantities are discussed using different data analysis procedures. The quality of the pulse-shape analysis and the tracking algorithm are evaluated. The agreement between the experimental data and the Geant4 simulations is also investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A theoretical method was proposed to evaluate Jesse effect quantitatively. Results indicate that besides Penning ionization, sub-excitation electrons also place very important influence on ionization enhancement by Jesse effect. An experiential expression about the relationship between enhancement factor and impurity concentration was established, in which second order of it fits experimental results very well. Theoretical calculation method in this paper is also applicable to evaluate Jesse effect in other kinds of mixtures besides hydrogen as impurities in helium. In addition, Jesse effects about tritium molecules as impurities have also been investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the case of direct disposal of SF, the radioactivity of the waste is higher and the potential effects of the radiation are greater. Specific examples of the possible effects of radiation include increased amounts of canister corrosion; generation of oxidizing chemical species in conjunction with decomposition of groundwater and accompanying oxidation of reducing groundwater; and increase in the dissolution rate of SF and the solubility of radionuclides. Focusing especially on the effects of -radiation in safety assessment, this study has reviewed research into the effects of -radiation on the SF, canisters and environment outside the canisters.

Specific examples of the possible effects of radiation include: increased amounts of canister corrosion; generation of oxidizing chemical species in conjunction with radiation degradation of groundwater and accompanying oxidation of reducing groundwater; and increase in the dissolution rate and the solubility of SF. Therefore, the influences of radiation, which are not expected to be significant in the case of geological disposal of vitrified waste, must be considered in safety assessments for direct disposal of SF. Focusing especially on the effects of -radiation in safety assessment, this study has reviewed safety assessments in countries other than Japan that are planning direct disposal of SF. The review has identified issues relevant to safety assessment for the direct disposal of SF in Japan.

The data were produced from different age groups within the public (newborns; 1-, 5-, 10-, and 15-year-old children; and adults) for the situations in which radioactive cesium is distributed uniformly in the soil over a planar area and at specific depths of 0.0, 0.5, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, and 50.0 g/cm(2). On the basis of the results, we also derive the conversion coefficients for exponentially distributed volumetric sources. In addition, we obtain the conversion coefficients that give the effective dose accumulated over the first and second months, the first year, and over a lifetime (50 years) because of the contamination remaining on the ground. These calculations indicate that the conversion coefficients to obtain the effective dose rate are higher for the younger ages compared with adults, but do not exceed the ambient dose equivalent rate. Furthermore, we find that the difference between the calculated effective dose rates according to the International Commission on Radiological Protection 1990 and 2007 Recommendations is small (7% maximum) for a ground contamination of radioactive cesium.

It requires that the variable breeding ratio can be achieved in operating a fast reactor without significant changes of the core, including the minimum change of fuel assembly design, the minimum change of the core configuration and the same control system arrangement in the core. The sodium cooled fast reactor is investigated. Two difficulties are overcome: (1) the different excess reactivity is well controlled for different cores, especially for the one with small breeding ratio; (2) the maximum linear power density is well controlled while the breeding ratio changes. The optimizations are done to meet the requirements. The U-Pu-Zr alloy is applied to enhance the breeding. The enrichment-zoning technique with unfixed blanket assembly loading position is searched to get acceptable power distributions when the breeding ratio changes. And the control system is designed redundantly to fulfill the control needs. Then, the achieved breeding ratio can be adjusted from 1.1 to 1.4. The reactivity coefficients, temperature distributions and preliminary safety performances are evaluated to investigate the feasibility of the new concept. All the results show that it is feasible to develop the fast reactor with flexible breeding ratios, although it still highly relies on the advancement of the coolant flow control technology.

The CNS is cooled by forced convective helium which is held at room temperature during stand-by (SO) mode and at similar to 20 K during normal operation (NO) mode. When helium cooling stops, the reactor is shut down to prevent the moderator cell from overheating. This computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study aims to determine whether the combined effects of conduction and natural convection would provide sufficient cooling for themoderator cell under the influence of reactor decay heat after reactor shutdown. To achieve this, two commercial CFD software packages using an identical CFD mesh were first assessed against an experimental heat transfer test of the CNS. It was found that both numericalmodels were valid within the bounds of experimental uncertainty. After this, one CFD model was used to simulate the thermosiphon transient condition after the reactor is shut down. Two independent shutdown conditions of different decay-heat power profiles were simulated. It was found that the natural convection and conduction cooling in the thermosiphon were sufficient for dissipating both decay-heat profiles, with the moderator cell remaining below the safe temperature of 200 degrees C.

For this reason, four disposal alternatives (KRS-1, A-KRS-1, A-KRS-21, and A-KRS-22) have been developed in order to carry out the direct disposal of the CANDU spent fuel. The objective of this study is to conduct cost efficiency analysis of the disposal alternatives in consideration of price volatility for the radioactive waste repository. To derive future price volatility, this study used the ARIMA model. As a result, A-KRS-1 is the most efficient in terms of price per bundle using 2015 price. As for the results using ARIMA model, except in the case of KRS-1, the cost per bundle of A-KRS-1, A-KRS-21, and A-KRS-22 is decreased. Cost estimation using ARIMA model shows little change or decreases in cost while cost estimation using inflation rates for 2020 resulted in approximately 7.2% increases compared to 2015 for all options. As for the results of scenario analysis, A-KRS-1 earned 8,160 points, while A-KRS-22 followed closely behind with 7,980 points among the total 24,300 points. The results of this study provide invaluable policy data for any nation considering the construction of spent nuclear fuel repository.

To fill this gap, a comprehensive investigation was performed to the radiation protection practices in the helium circulator maintenance of the Chinese 10MW HTR test module (HTR-10) in this paper. The investigation reveals the unique behaviour of HTR-10's radiation sources in the maintenance as well as its radionuclide species and presents the radiation protection methods that were tailored to these features. Owing to these practices, the radioactivity level was kept low throughout the maintenance and only low-level radioactive waste was generated. The quantitative analysis further demonstrates that the decontamination efficiency was over 89% for surface contamination and over 34% for.. dose rate and the occupational exposure was much lower than both the limits of regulatory and the exposure levels in comparable literature. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the reported radiation protection practices, which directly provides hands-on experience for the future HTR-PM reactor and adds to the completeness of the radiation protection methodology.

J	Rezaeian, M; Kamali, J				Rezaeian, Mahdi; Kamali, Jamshid			Radioactive Source Specification of Bushehr's VVER-1000 Spent Fuels	SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF NUCLEAR INSTALLATIONS			English	Article								Due to high radioactivity and significant content of medium- and long-lived radionuclides, different operations with spent nuclear fuels (e.g., handling, transportation, and storage) shall be accompanied by suitable radiation protections. On the other hand, determination of radioactive source specification is the initial step for any radiation protection design. In this study, radioactive source specification of the spent fuels of Bushehr nuclear power plant, which is a VVER-1000 type pressurized water reactor, was determined. For the depletion and decay calculations, ORIGEN code was utilized. The results are presented for burnups of 30 to 49GWd/MTHM and different cooling times up to 100 years. According to these results, total activity of a spent fuel assembly with initial enrichment of 3.92%, burnup of 49GWd/MTHM, and cooling time of 3 years is 1.92 x 10(16) Bq. The results can be utilized specifically in transportation/storage cask design for spent fuel management of Bushehr nuclear power plant.

J	Sahin, S; Ali, M				Sahin, Sumer; Ali, Muhammad			Emergency Planning Zones Estimation for Karachi-2 and Karachi-3 Nuclear Power Plants using Gaussian Puff Model	SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF NUCLEAR INSTALLATIONS			English	Article								Emergency planning zones (PAZ and UPZ) around the Karachi-2 and Karachi-3 nuclear power plants (K-2/K-3 NPPs) have been realistically determined by employing Gaussian puff model and Gaussian plume model together for atmospheric transport, diffusion, and deposition of radioactive material using onsite and regional data related to meteorology, topography, and land-use along with latest IAEA Post-Fukushima Guidelines. The analysis work has been carried out using U.S. NRC computer code RASCAL 4.2. The assumed environmental radioactive releases provide the sound theoretical and practical bases for the estimation of emergency planning zones covering most expected scenario of severe accident and most recent multiunit Fukushima Accident. Sheltering could be used as protective action for longer period of about 04 days. The area about 3 km of K-2/K-3 NPPs site should be evacuated and an iodine thyroid blocking agent should be taken before release up to about 14 km to prevent severe deterministic effects. Stochastic effects may be avoided or minimized by evacuating the area within about 8 km of the K-2/K-3 NPPs site. Protective actions may become more effective and cost beneficial by using current methodology as Gaussian puff model realistically represents atmospheric transport, dispersion, and disposition processes in contrast to straight-line Gaussian plume model explicitly in study area. The estimated PAZ and UPZ were found 3 km and 8 km, respectively, around K-2/K-3 NPPs which are in well agreement with IAEA Post-Fukushima Study. Therefore, current study results could be used in the establishment of emergency planning zones around K-2/K-3 NPPs.

J	Shibata, A; Koma, Y; Ohi, T				Shibata, Atsuhiro; Koma, Yoshikazu; Ohi, Takao			Estimation of the inventory of the radioactive wastes in Fukushima Daiichi NPS with a radionuclide transport model in the contaminated water	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station; estimation of inventory; contaminated water; water treatment system; secondary waste; calculation	SPENT NUCLEAR-FUEL	Quantification of the radioactive waste inventory remaining inside the reactors at Fukushima Daiichi NPS is necessary to effectively plan their recovery, treatment, and disposal. Analysis of radionuclide concentrations and secondary wastes in the contaminated water treatment system can provide a means to estimate the radioactive waste inventory, which is not possible by more direct methods due to problems of accessibility and high levels of radiation. A predictive model has therefore been developed to estimate the radioactive waste inventory from the radionuclide concentrations and throughputs in the contaminated water. Model fitting has enabled the estimation of the key parameters, such as the initial radionuclide concentration C-0, the continuous release rate F, and inventory of source of continuous release I-S0. An estimated one-third of the total Cs-137 inventory has already made its way into the water treatment system as secondary wastes, whereas half still remains inside the damaged reactors as of 13 March 2014.
