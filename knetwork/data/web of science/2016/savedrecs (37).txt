J	Nakabayashi, R; Sugiyama, D				Nakabayashi, Ryo; Sugiyama, Daisuke			Development of methodology of probabilistic safety assessment for radioactive waste disposal in consideration of epistemic uncertainty and aleatory uncertainty	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Radioactive waste management; epistemic uncertainty; aleatory uncertainty; PSA; Monte Carlo calculation; sub-surface disposal	DENSITY-ESTIMATION; BANDWIDTH SELECTION; CROSS-VALIDATION	Probabilistic safety assessment has not been performed for radioactive waste disposal owing to the difficulty of dealing with the probability distributions of the parameters included in the long-term safety assessment of radioactive waste disposal. In this study, we develop a methodology of probabilistic safety assessment in consideration of both epistemic uncertainty and aleatory uncertainty, in which the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the maximum annual dose can be calculated. We also propose an approach to demonstrating dose assessment results in compliance with the stepwise target annual doses of likely and less-likely scenarios according to the occurrence probability of the scenario without classifying the probabilities of parameters involved prior to the safety assessment. For the likely scenario, we can employ the larger of the modal value of the PDF and the 50th percentile of the CDF to meet the target annual dose (10 mu Sv y(-1)). For the less-likely scenario, we can adopt the 95th percentile of the CDF as the assessment result for comparison with the target annual dose (300 mu Sv y(-1)).

Even though the PRIDE facility utilizes depleted uranium, instead of actual spent fuel, as process material, it will play an important role not only from the process perspective, but also from the safeguards standpoint. In the present study, a Compton imaging system based on pixelated GAGG:Ce scintillation detectors was constructed and tested to determine its utility for accurate imaging of nuclear material locations and, thus, its applicability as a safeguards monitoring system at the PRIDE facility. In a lab-scale performance evaluation, when the dose rate induced by a Cs-137 point-like source was approximate to 0.1 Sv/h, the source location was imaged within 5 min. The image resolutions were 22 degrees and 7.6 degrees for real-time monitoring using a back-projection algorithm and for near-real-time monitoring using a statistical iterative algorithm, respectively. The developed Compton imaging system was finally applied to low-enriched uranium and also to depleted uranium, which latter is the process material of the PRIDE facility, and it was indicated that the Compton imaging system can localize nuclear materials within a few minutes under conditions similar to those prevailing at the PRIDE facility. The results of this study show that the Compton imaging system, and Compton imaging technology in general, has a great potential for utilization as a nuclear material monitoring tool at the PRIDE facility.

This can be achieved prior to actual experiments by using computer simulations to analyze the shape, arrangement, and size of the cathode. In this paper, tertiary-model-based computational analysis was performed on a planar-type electrorefiner. Flat-plate and rod-type cathodes were analyzed under constant-current condition; calculations were performed on high-efficiency-type electrodes with convection effects under the same conditions by comparing the dependence of the generated overpotential on the applied current. Analytic and experimental results were analyzed by comparing the electric potential of the plate-type device with that of a uranium electrorefiner while varying the arrangement of the electrodes.

Target material is lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE). ThO2, UO2, PuO2, and CmO2 TRISO particles are used as fuel. PuO2 and CmO2 fuels are extracted from PWR-MOX spent fuel. Subcritical core is radially divided into 10 equidistant subzones in order to flatten the power produced in the core. Tens of thousands of these TRISO fuel particles are embedded in the carbon matrix fuel pebbles as five different cases. The high-energy Monte Carlo code MCNPX 2.7 with the LA150 library is used for the neutronic calculations. Time-dependent burnup calculations are carried out for thermal fission power (P-th) of 1000 MW using the BURN card. The energy gain of the ADS is in the range of 99.98-148.64 at the beginning of a cycle. Furthermore, the peak-to-average fission power density ratio is obtained between 1.021 and 1.029 at the beginning of the cycle. These ratios show a good quasi-uniform power density for each case. Furthermore, up to 155.1 g U-233 and 103.6 g Pu-239 per day can be produced. The considered system has a high neutronic capability in terms of energy multiplication, fissile breeding, and spent fuel transmutation with thorium utilization.

In order to evaluate the irradiation integrity and validate the in-reactor of the starting metallic fuel with FMS cladding for the loading of the metallic fuel, U-10wt.% Zr fuel rodlets were fabricated and evaluated for a verification of the starting driver fuel through an irradiation test in the BOR-60 fast reactor. The injection casting method was applied to U-10wt.% Zr fuel slugs with a diameter of 5.5 mm. Consequently, fuel slugs permelting batch without casting defects were fabricated through the development of advanced casting technology and evaluation tests. The optimal GTAW welding conditions were also established through a number of experiments. In addition, a qualification test was carried out to prove the weld quality of the end plug welding of the metallic fuel rodlets. The wire wrapping of metallic fuel rodlets was successfully accomplished for the irradiation test. Thus, PGSFR fuel rodlets have been soundly fabricated for the irradiation test in a BOR-60 fast reactor.

This paper provides relatively rapid and simple procedures of bioassay. Faeces samples were ashed to improve sample homogeneity. Gamma spectrometry was used for radioactivity measurement. The measured results, including activity of the biosamples and associated uncertainty, were evaluated for traceability based on ANSI N42.22 and bias and precision based on ANIS/HPS N13.30. For all urine customary exercise samples, measurement results of Co-60 and Cs-137 were in good agreement with NIST values within 5% and satisfied ANSI N42.22 and ANIS/HPS N13.30 acceptance criteria. In contrast, the uncertainty of Co-57 was quite large and the activity differed from the NIST value by 18%. For the urine emergency preparedness exercise, all measured results agreed well with NIST values, with less than 10% difference. Synthetic faeces samples included Mn-54, Co-60, and Cs-134. The activity of Co-60 was different from the NIST value by 9%, whereas the results for Mn-54 and Cs-134 were within 3.2%. The measurement procedures given in this study can be applied to assess intake of radionuclides and resulting radiation dose to casualties.

Sample solutions containing solid amorphous thorium hydroxide (Th(OH)(4)(am)) were prepared by the oversaturation method, and stored in a temperature chamber kept at an aging temperature (T-a) of 363 K for specified periods. The sample solutions were then cooled to 298 K for measurement of the apparent solubilities. The apparent solubilities, after aging at T-a = 363 K, decreased about 3 orders of magnitude from the solubility of Th(OH)(4)(am) at T-a = 298 K. The solid phases were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in order to determine the particle sizes in the thorium hydroxide solid phases. A slight growth of the particle size of the solid phases after aging at T-a = 363 K was suggested from the obtained XRD spectrum and was correlated to the decrease of the apparent solubility at T-a = 363 K based on the particle size effect of the solubility product.

We focused on the change in the efficiency of tritium oxidation of a catalytic reactor in an event of fire where the air accompanied with hydrocarbons, water vapor, and tritium is fed into a catalytic reactor at the same time. Our test results on the effect of these gases on the efficiency of tritium oxidation of the catalytic reactor indicated; (1) tritiated hydrocarbon produces significantly by reaction between tritium and hydrocarbons in a catalytic reactor; (2) there is little possibility of degradation in the detritiation performance because the tritiated hydrocarbons produced in the catalyst reactor are combusted; (3) there is no possibility of uncontrollable rise in the temperature of the catalytic reactor by heat of reactions; and (4) saturated water vapor could temporarily poison the catalyst and degrades the detritiation performance. Our investigation indicated a saturated water vapor condition without hydrocarbons would be the dominant scenario to determine the amount of catalyst for the design of catalytic reactor of the detritiation system.

Effects of gamma irradiation on some chemicals using an NaI (Tl) detector	RADIATION EFFECTS AND DEFECTS IN SOLIDS			English	Article						Gamma rays; mass attenuation coefficient; molar extinction coefficient; NaI (Tl) detector; chemicals	MASS ATTENUATION COEFFICIENT; EFFECTIVE ATOMIC NUMBERS; AMINO-ACIDS; ELECTRON-DENSITIES; GLASSES	The present work was carried out to find out the gamma ray shielding properties and to study the effects using an NaI (Tl) detector using radioactive sources Co-57, Ba-133, Cs-137, Mn-54, Co-60 and Na-22 at energies 122, 356, 511, 662, 840, 1170, 1275 and 1330 keV, for some chemicals, namely, sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3), benzoic acid (C7H6O2), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) (C2H4O), potassium nitrate (KNO3), naphthalene (C10H8). Mass attenuation coefficient (mu(m)) values obtained from the experiment were used to determine the effective atomic numbers (Z(eff)) and effective electron densities (N-eff), atomic cross-sections (sigma(t)) and electronic cross-sections (sigma(e)); it will be observed from the present work that the variation in the obtained values is only due to the increase or decrease in the gamma ray energy and the chemical composition of the sample. It was seen that the calculated and obtained values showed good agreement. The investigated data are useful in the electronic industry, plastic industry, building materials and agriculture fields. From the present work it was found that the PVA could be used as a better gamma shielding material.	[Bhosale, R. R.; Gaikwad, D. K.; Pawar, P.

Radioactivity concentration measurement and analysis in construction floor materials of Korea	RADIATION EFFECTS AND DEFECTS IN SOLIDS			English	Article						High-purity germanium; detector (HPGe); buildingflooring materials; the concentration of radionuclides	AREAS	In this study, the radioactive concentrations contained in samples of commonly used building floor materials were measured. This result can be used as basic information for public health and the environment. Among building floor materials, samples of induction blocks, cement bricks, artificial granite blocks and compact high-pressure blocks were chosen and used. A detailed gamma nuclide analysis was performed with a multichannel analyzer by putting these samples on a high-purity germanium detector which is a semiconductor detector. In order to measure the concentration of radionuclides, a spectrum file was obtained by analyzing the concentration ofgamma radionuclides and setting the measurement time as 1000, 4000, 7000 and 10,000 s. According to the study results, K-40, Bi-214, Pb-214, Ra226 and U-235 were detected in the induction blocks measured at 10,000 s and K-40, Th-230, Bi-214, Pb-214, Ra-226 and Na-22 were detected in the cement bricks measured at 10,000 s. K-40, Bi-214, Pb214, Th-234, U-235 and Ra-223 were detected in the artificial granite blocks measured at 10,000 s and K-40, Bi-214, Pb-214, Th-234, Ra226, Ra-223 and Mn-54 were detected in the compact high-pressure blocks. In conclusion, low-level radioactivity was detected in building floor materials, so it is thought that measures to reduce radioactivity and further studies on this will be needed.	[Kim, G.

J	Anderson, BC; Holbert, KE; Bowler, H				Anderson, Blake C.; Holbert, Keith E.; Bowler, Herbert			Design, Construction, and Modeling of a Cf-252 Neutron Irradiator	SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF NUCLEAR INSTALLATIONS			English	Article							PROMPT GAMMA-RAYS; SPONTANEOUS FISSION; ACCELERATOR; PLUTONIUM; REACTOR; MCNP	Neutron production methods are an integral part of research and analysis for an array of applications. This paper examines methods of neutron production, and the advantages of constructing a radioisotopic neutron irradiator assembly using Cf-252. Characteristic neutron behavior and cost-benefit comparative analysis between alternative modes of neutron production are also examined. The irradiator is described from initial conception to the finished design. MCNP modeling shows a total neutron flux of 3 x 10(5) n/(cm(2).s) in the irradiation chamber for a (25)mu g source. Measurements of the gamma-ray and neutron dose rates near the external surface of the irradiator assembly are 120 mu Gy/h and 30 mu Sv/h, respectively, during irradiation. At completion of the project, total material, and labor costs remained below $50,000.

The evaluation is carried out in MATLAB/Simulink software environment as well as with an existing power measurement and signal processing system. The new signal processing algorithm is obtained based on the synthesis of several first order low pass filters with different delayed time constants. Throughout this paper, a special attention has been paid to compare the new signal processing system with the existing one. The dynamic behavior of the new signal processing system in the practical large loss of coolant accidents (LLOCA) events has also been examined. Simulation results show that during the LLOCA event, the reactor trip time, as well as the peak power, is decreased remarkably. Through the simulation studies, it has convincingly demonstrated that the new signal processing system has significant advantages over the existing system in terms of the improved trip response and accommodation of the spurious trip immunity. This advantage will significantly enhance the safety margin, or will bring economical benefits to nuclear power plants.

To this end, the following steps were taken: (1) as much destructive analysis (DA) data as possible for segments taken from a PWR UO2 spent fuel rod were aggregated from publicly available data sources; (2) the DA data were corrected so as to have the same cooling time (i.e., CT = 0 y) and analyzed for outliers; (3) an equation converting the Cs-137 amount to the Pu amount was obtained by regression analysis with logarithmic curve fitting; and (4) the error in determining the Pu amount was evaluated for the imposition of a limit on the range of burnup (BU) or initial enrichment (IE). It was found that the averaged % error in calibration was determined to be 3.88% +/- 2.68% (= mean +/- 1 standard deviation) for the BU range over 30GWd/tU and falling with increasing BU range. On the other hand, there was no benefit in applying the limit of the IE range. Lastly, the Pu-mass difference between various methods was compared and it was found that the difference can be incurred up to 11.4%, according to the choice of method. In conclusion, the proposed isotope correlation technique could be used for input material accountancy with reasonable uncertainty.

Experiments were carried out under variable pH and carbonate concentrations. Distribution coefficients (K-d) decreased with increased carbonate concentrations and showed the minimal value at around pH 10. This sorption tendency was seen for all the rock and mineral samples, and it was due to the formation of aqueous hydroxo-carbonate complexes of Th in the solutions. The order of sorbability for Th was mica > feldspar > quartz approximate to granite. The sorption behaviors of Th were analyzed by the non-electrostatic surface complexation model with the Visual Minteq computer program. The K-d for granite were calculated by component additivity approaches. The model calculations were able to explain the experimental results reasonably well. It was shown that the sorption behavior of Th onto granite can be explained by the complexation with the surface sites of mainly biotite and feldspar.

Certain ion exchange resins have been developed for use in reprocessing technology. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the U selectivity of a benzimidazole-type anion exchange resin and its potential for the separation of U from a solution of simulant fuel debris in HCl. The selectivity of the benzimidazole-type anion exchange resin for adsorption of the major elements present in fuel debris in HCl solution (such as in debris from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant) was analyzed, and the tendencies were discussed from the viewpoint of complexation. Moreover, chromatographic separation of U from the other elements was evaluated using the resin. The results indicate that this type of resin has high U separation selectivity. Consequently, the authors developed a novel strategy involving the use of this resin for U separation in conjunction with chlorination of hardly soluble materials by using atmospheric-pressure nonthermal plasma. This strategy is also proposed to be applicable for stabilizing waste forms and for nuclear fuel material accounting, such as for debris from the Fukushima nuclear power plant and other complex hardly soluble nuclear materials.

J	Yamamoto, T; Sakai, T				Yamamoto, Toru; Sakai, Tomohiro			Analysis of fuel temperature effects on reactivity of light water reactor fuel assemblies by using MVP-2 adopting an exact resonance elastic scattering model	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						MVP; resonance elastic scattering; neutron multiplication factor; Doppler reactivity; light water reactor; fuel assembly; UO2; MOX; energy-dependent reaction rate	KERNEL	Using the continuous-energy Monte Carlo code MVP-2 adopting a resonance elastic scattering model considering the thermal motion of a target nucleus (the exact model) for major heavy nuclides, analysis of fuel temperature effects on reactivity of mockup UO2 and MOX fuel assemblies for light water reactors was performed, and the results were compared with those of the conventional asymptotic model. A base condition was a hot operating condition with an in-channel void fraction of 40% and fuel temperature of 520 ? for the BWR fuel assemblies and a hot zero-power condition with fuel temperature of 284 ? for the PWR fuel assemblies. The fuel temperature of a high-temperature condition was 1500 ? for both types of assemblies. The calculated results showed that the exact model made the neutron multiplication factors at the high-temperature condition lower by -220 to -440 pcm (10(-5) k) and the Doppler reactivity between the base- and high-temperature conditions more negative by 7% to 10% compared with those obtained by the asymptotic model. The energy-dependent reaction rates of capture and -fission were also analyzed to study the detail mechanism in the effect of the exact model on the assembly reactivity.

A three-node transport model of ACPs was introduced into the new version of ACPs source term code CATE in this paper, which makes CATE capable of theoretically simulating the variation and the distribution of ACPs in a water-cooled reactor and suitable for more operating conditions. For code testing, MIT PWR coolant chemistry loop was simulated, and the calculation results from CATE are close to the experimental results from MIT, which means CATE is available and credible on ACPs analysis of water-cooled reactor. Then ACPs in the blanket cooling loop of water-cooled fusion reactor ITER under construction were analyzed using CATE and the results showed that the major contributors are the short-life nuclides, especially Mn-56. At last a point kernel integration code ARShield was coupled with CATE, and the dose rate around ITER blanket cooling loop was calculated. Results showed that after shutting down the reactor only for 8 days, the dose rate decreased nearly one order of magnitude, which was caused by the rapid decay of the short-life ACPs.

J	Heierli, J				Heierli, Joachim			A comparative study of engineering options for the disposal of high-level radioactive waste with regard to thermal effects and chemical degradation	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Geological disposal; high level radioactive waste; comparative evaluation; uncertainty; thermal activation; illitisation	TO-ILLITE CONVERSION	The disposal of high-level radioactive waste in deep geological repositories requires stable and foreseeable physical conditions over very long time scales. During this period, the chemical stability of both the natural and the engineered barriers is governed by thermally activated processes. These in turn are driven by the heat pulse generated by the nuclear decay of waste products. The technical concept to cap the temperature peak in the repository is thus an important aspect for the proof of safety of disposal facilities. It is shown that densely stocked repositories, as currently foreseen in several countries, do not necessarily represent the optimal choice with regard to temperature effects, long-term reaction kinetics and chemical degradation of components. It is suggested that the optimization of the temperature peak rather than the fulfillment of cut-off conditions for peak temperature should be a cardinal issue in engineering concepts.

The oxidation rate measurement of chromium from Cr(III) to Cr(VI) was performed by 1M boiling nitric acid solution containing each highly concentrated nitrates: Al(NO3)(3), Nd(NO3)(3), Ca(NO3)(2), Mg(NO3)(2), and NaNO3 as a simulant of uranium nitrate in uranium concentrator in reprocessing plants. As a result, the rate of chromium oxidation was different depending on the added nitrates even at the same nitric acid concentration. In addition, the oxidation rate of chromium was increased with increasing the calculated partial pressure of nitric acid in consideration of the hydration of cation of nitrates. Furthermore, the corrosion rate of type 310 stainless steel was accelerated by the solution having a high chromium oxidation rate containing nitrates. These results indicated that the acceleration of the corrosion rate in the solutions depending on the oxidation rate of chromium, and the rate is affected by the salt-effect of nitrates.

We synthesized a macroporous sillica/polymer-based isoHexyl-BTP adsorbent (isoHexyl-BTP/SiO2-P) for the separation of MA(III) from Ln(III) in high-level liquid waste. The work focused on the isoHexyl-BTP/SiO2-P adsorption mechanism towards Ln(III) in nitric acid solution and the coordination chemistry between Ln(III) and isoHexyl-BTP/SiO2-P through batch adsorption experiments, extended X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy, acid-base titration and ion chromatography. It was found that both H+ and NO3- directly participated in the adsorption reaction. For the middle and heavy Ln(III), Ln(isoHexyl-BTP/SiO2-P)(3)(NO3)(3)3HNO(3) was supposed as the main product of the adsorption. The Ln(III)-N (Ln(isoHexyl-BTP/SiO2-P)(3)(3+)) bond length of the first coordination layer decreased as the atomic number of Ln(III) increased, which explains the increased adsorption affinity of isoHexyl-BTP/SiO2-P towards middle and heavy Ln(III) in relatively high concentration nitric acid as the Ln(III) atomic number increased.

The transport coefficients are defined both in the macroscopic (wall formula for friction and Werner-Wheeler approximation for the mass tensor) and microscopic (linear response theory and local harmonic approximation) approaches. It is shown that at low excitation energy, the macroscopic and microscopic quantities differ substantially in dependence both on deformation and temperature. Thus, the microscopic effect in transport coefficients should be taken in account by the description of low-energy nuclear collisions and fission process.

Even now, more than 150,000 people in Fukushima prefecture are still relocated from their homes. In order to estimate how long such relocation might continue, we estimated radiation exposures for the 10 years following the accident that occurred on 12 March 2011, using European model for inhabited areas (ERMIN) developed by a partnership of several European organizations. We validated the estimated results of long-term radiation exposure with the observed data at 1, 2 and 3 years after the nuclear accident. We analyzed the deposition velocity and re-suspension coefficient using the observed data on air concentration, amount of falling dust and soil contamination, and compared them with the published data.

In the experiments using HALW obtained through laboratory-scale reprocessing, the release ratio was measured for fission product (FP) nuclides such as Ru, Tc-99, Cs, Sr, Nd, Y, Mo, Rh and actinides such as Cm-242 and Am-241. As a result, the release ratio was 0.20 for Ru and was around 1 x 10(-4) for the FP and actinide nuclides. Ru was released into the gas phase in the form of both mist and gas. For its released amount, weak dependency was found to its initial concentration in the test solution. The release ratio decreased with the increase in the initial concentration. For other FP nuclides and actinides as non-volatile, released into the gas phase in the form of mist, the released amount increased with the increase in the initial concentration. The release ratio of Ru and NOx concentration increased with the increase in the temperature of the test solutions. They were released together almost at the same temperature between 200 and 300 degrees C. Size distribution of particles like mist was measured. The data show that there was a difference between distributions at the temperatures below 150 degrees C and over 200 degrees C.

The effect of the temperature on the kinetics of the oxidation and reduction of dioxide uranium was investigated, respectively, in the range 250 degrees C-600 degrees C and 300 degrees C-800 degrees C. For the oxidation process, the kinetics is low below 350 degrees C, and is fast at higher temperatures. The same phenomenon is observed for the reduction process, where the rate accelerates at above 500 degrees C and the reduction completed in shorter time. Using a laser particle size analyzer and a Brunauer, Emmett, Teller (BET) analyzer, it was determined that the oxidation at 400 degrees C gives a triuranium octoxide powder with an adequate particle size (33 mu m) and a specific surface area of 0.9 m(2)/g in reasonable time (210 min). Reducing the triuranium octoxide to uranium dioxide powder at 600 degrees C in pure hydrogen was completely achieved after only 16 minutes, without affecting its characteristics. To ameliorate the specific surface area, several oxidation-reduction cycles were performed on the obtained uranium dioxide powder. It is found that after five cycles, the specific surface area of uranium dioxide was improved to more than 2.5 m(2)/g, minimum value required to the powder sinterability.

In this process, a layer of fine Pt nano particles is formed in an aqueous solution on the base metal of the piping following the chemical decontamination. In this study, we confirmed that the suppression effect by the Pt-C toward Co-60 deposition on type 316 stainless steel using a Co-60 deposition test under hydrogen water chemistry. Furthermore, we investigated the suppression mechanism of deposition of radioactive elements by a quantum molecular simulation. The deposition amounts of Co-60 which were incorporated in oxides after 1000 h with and without the Pt-C process were about 90 and 10.2 Bq/cm(2), respectively. The amount of Co-60 deposition with Pt-C is about 10% that of non-coated specimens. The Co-60 incorporation for the Pt-C specimen was suppressed by decreasing the formation of oxides. We considered this phenomenon using a quantum dynamics calculation and concluded that the Fe-O bonds in oxides were weakened by the effect of Pt and hydrogen radicals which were produced in the reaction between H-2 and Pt, and then oxides were dissolved into the water.

NMA has two components: destructive analysis (DA) and non-destructive assay (NDA). Although DA is more accurate, it is typically time-consuming and cost-intensive. NDA, on the other hand, can provide reasonable accuracy on a real-time or near-real-time basis, which maximizes the utilization efficiency of a facility. In this study, the PRIDE (PyRoprocessing Integrated inactive DEmonstration) UNDA (unified non-destructive assay) was developed for testing NDA techniques at PRIDE, a demonstration facility within KAERI for integrated pyroprocessing using depleted uranium and surrogate materials. Each component of the PRIDEUNDA(i.e., neutron, gamma-ray, and mass measurement systems) was characterized and calibrated using calibration sources and standard weights as well as nuclear material used in the facility (depleted uranium). It is expected that in the near future, the PRIDE UNDA will be installed and tested with various types of process materials.

In parts 1-4, LESs of turbulent flows and plume dispersion over a flat terrain, around an isolated building, within building arrays with different obstacle densities, and within an actual urban area were performed, which showed the basic performance comparable to wind tunnel experimental technique. In this study, we extend the LOHDIM-LES to turbulent flows and plume dispersion in an actual urban area under real meteorological conditions by coupling with a meso-scale meteorological simulation model. The LES results of wind speed, wind direction, and concentration values are generally reproduced well. It is concluded that our coupling approach between LES and meso-scale meteorological models is effective in detailed simulations of turbulent flows and plume dispersion in urban areas under real meteorological conditions.

After irradiation, one of the fuel rod pellets was examined by X-ray CT and conventional nondestructive and destructive methods. Swelling rate was evaluated by both dimensional change and radial density distribution. There were no differences between both types of results and it was concluded that swelling rate can be examined in detail by the X-ray CT technique without dismantling the assembly. In addition, the swelling rate of hollow pellets was nearly the same as values reported for the fuel rods containing solid pellets. LHR was higher in the examined fuel rod containing hollow pellets than in the conventional fuel rod containing solid pellets, but fission gas release rates for both fuel rods were nearly the same.

Minor actinide transmutation in fast reactor metal fuels irradiated for 120 and 360 equivalent full-power days	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						minor actinides; neptunium; americium; curium; transmutation; fast reactor; metal fuel; post-irradiation examination; burnup calculation	WASTE; CORE	An irradiation experiment on uranium-plutonium-zirconium (U-Pu-Zr) alloys containing 5 wt% or less minor actinides (MAs) and rare earths was carried out in the Phenix fast reactor. The isotope compositions of the fuel alloys irradiated for 120 and 360 equivalent full-power days (EFPDs) were chemically analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry after 3.3-5.3 years of cooling. The results of chemical analysis indicated that the discharged burnups of the fuel alloys irradiated for 120 and 360 EFPDs were 2.1-2.5 and 5.3-6.4 at%, respectively. The changes in the isotopic abundances of plutonium, americium, and curium during the irradiation experiment were assessed to discuss the transmutation performance of MA nuclides added to U-Pu-Zr alloy fuel. Multigroup three-dimensional diffusion and burnup calculations accurately predicted the changes in these isotopic abundances after fuel fabrication. An evaluation of the MA transmutation ratio based on the results of chemical analysis revealed that the quantity of MA elements in the U 19Pu 10Zr 5MA (wt%) alloy decreased by about 20% during the irradiation experiment for 360 EFPDs.

Effective decontamination is demanded to encourage evacuated people to return. This paper proposes a new survey system using an unmanned helicopter equipped with a Compton camera for localizing radionuclides. As a prototype, 32 Ce:Gd3(Al,Ga)(5)O-12 (GAGG) crystals were coupled to 16 silicon photomultipliers and 16 avalanched photodiodes as the scatterer and absorber, respectively. A new Dynamic Time-over-Threshold (dToT) method was applied to convert CR-RC shaping signals to digital signals formulti-channel spectra and coincidence acquisition. The system was designed to work in two modes: one is Compton-camera mode (CCM) which obtains the radiation distribution maps through Compton imaging using hovering flights, while the other one is Gamma-camera mode (GCM) which maps the radiation distribution via measured coincidence events using programmed flights. For point source in CCM, an intrinsic efficiency of 1.68% with a combined standard uncertainty of 0.04% and an angular resolution of about 14 degrees (FWHM, full width at half maximum) was achieved. In GCM, a spatial resolution of about 11 cm (FWHM) was obtained when detecting area is 11.2 cm away from the detector, while it was about 28 cm (FWHM) in single detector mode (SDM). Promising results were obtained in field in Fukushima.

The numerical model was established in the frame of Eulerian-Eulerian approach, in which the modeling of the forces acting on the bubbles was introduced. Based on the model, numerical simulations with three flow rates were carried out. Three key parameters (the pressure loss, the separation length, the liquid entrainment ratio) concerned with the separation performance were compared between the numerical results and the experimental data, the results indicate that the calculated results agree well with the experimental data. Hence, the numerical approach shows a promising tool for the performance prediction and the optimization of the gas-liquid separator.

Although there have been significant improvements in the lattice physics calculations over the several decades, there exist still relatively large errors in the resonance interference treatment, in the order of similar to 300 pcm in the reactivity prediction of LWRs. In the newly developed method, the impact of resonance interference to the multi-group cross-sections has been quantified and tabulated in a library which can be used in lattice physics calculation as adjustment factors of multi-group cross-sections. The verification of the new method has been performed with Mosteller benchmark, UO2 andMOXpin-cell depletion problems, and a 17x17 fuel assembly loaded with gadolinia burnable poison, and significant improvements were demonstrated in the accuracy of reactivity and pin power predictions, with reactivity errors down to the order of similar to 100 pcm.

The thermal neutron capture cross sections of Pu-238 and Am-241 in JEFF-3.2 are 31% and 9% larger than those of JENDL-4.0, respectively. This paper shows the effect of the differences in the neutron cross sections on analysis results of two different integral experiments. The first is the isotopic compositions of Pu-238 on UO2 and MOX fuels irradiated in BWR and PWR, and the second is the critical experiments of the water moderated cores fully loaded with MOX fuels. The former was analyzed by using the continuous energy Monte Carlo burnup calculation code MVP-BURN and the latter by the continuous energy Monte Carlo calculation code MVP. The comparisons between the calculated and measured results indicate that the most likely thermal and epithermal neutron capture cross sections of Pu-238 and Am-241 should be around at the middle between those of JEFF-3.2 and JENDL-4.0.

Investigation of deuterium retention in/desorption from beryllium-containing mixed layers	NUCLEAR MATERIALS AND ENERGY			English	Article						Fuel retention; Beryllium	MATERIAL COATING FORMATION; CARBON-FILMS; PLASMA EXPOSURE; DESORPTION	This article reports experimental results regarding the deuterium (D) retention and release characteristics of beryllium-containing mixed material layers. The main aim is an assessment of the efficiency of the tritium removal procedure currently suggested for ITER, i.e., wall baking at 513 K (240 degrees C) for the main chamber walls and 623 K (350 degrees C) for the divertor. It is observed that the tritium retention as well as the removal efficiency by a following baking procedure will strongly depend on the composition of the deposited layer and the wall temperature during plasma operation. In the case that D is implanted at moderate temperatures (300 to 400 K), which would correspond to the "cool divertor" scenario in ITER, a large fraction of retained D is trapped in states having a low D binding energy and correspondingly low release temperature. Therefore, in this case baking can release a significant amount of retained D. On the other hand, if D is implanted at temperatures above 520 K, which would correspond to the "hot divertor" scenario in ITER, the amount of retained D will be significantly lower, but the retained D is predominantly trapped in high-energy binding states. In such a case, even baking at 623 K might not efficiently remove the retained tritium. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In order to investigate the performance of the spent fuel rack under the earthquake, the phenomena including sliding, collision, and overturning of the spent fuel rack were studied. An FEM model of spent fuel rack is built to simulate the transient response under seismic loading regarding fluid-structure interaction by ANSYS. Based on D'Alambert's principle, the equilibriums of force and momentum were established to obtain the critical sliding and overturning accelerations. Then 5 characteristic transient loadings which were designed based on the critical sliding and overturning accelerations were applied to the rack FEM model. Finally, the transient displacement and impact force response of rack with different gap sizes and the supporting leg friction coefficients were analyzed. The result proves the FEM model is applicable for seismic response of spent fuel rack. This paper can guide the design of the future's fluid-structure interaction experiment for spent fuel rack.

The RHM system is a sophisticated man-machine system. Therefore, human factors analysis is an inevitable aspect considered in guaranteeing successful and safe task performance. This study proposes an approach for integrated analysis of human factors in RHM so as to make the evaluating process more practical. In the approach, indicators of accessibility, health safety, and fatigue are analyzed using virtual human simulation technologies. The human error factors in the maintenance process are analyzed using the human error probability (HEP) based on the success likelihood index method-(SLIM-) analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The psychological factors level of maintenance personnel is determined with an expert scoring. The human factors for the entire RHM system are then evaluated using the interval method. An application example is present, and the application results show that the approach can support the evaluation of the human factors in RHM.

The leaching ratio of radionuclides was investigated under atmospheric conditions at 25 degrees C for non-filtered natural surface seawater, as well as deionized water after filtration with a membrane of 0.45-mu m pore size or that of nominal molecular weight limit of 3 kDa. The uranium molar concentration was affected by the oxidation state in the solid solution samples. The congruent dissolution of Cs, I, and Ba with the hexavalent uranium of U3O8 was facilitated in the seawater samples, whereas a lower leaching ratio of nuclides was observed in the deionized water samples. Neptunium-239, originally produced from uranium-238 in U3O8, showed behavior that was similar to that of Cs, I, and Ba. However, the dissolution of Np (as a parent nuclide of Pu-239) in the debris of UO2 and UO2-ZrO2 was suppressed in the same manner as Zr(IV) and Ce(IV).

"dirty bombs") by applying to chosen surrogate compound rapid high temperature transients, vaporizing the sample and forming aerosols mainly by rapid cooling of the vapour. The materials, which were tested in their non-radioactive form, had been chosen from the radioactive sources widely used in industries and nuclear medicine applications, Co, CsCl, Ir and SrTiO3. Our analyses permitted the characterization of the inhalable fraction of the aerosols released, and the study of the influence of cladding materials on the aerosol release and on its characteristics.

The D permeability was obtained for un-damaged W at various temperatures. For both D-2 (+) and C+ implanted W, the permeability was clearly reduced. But, for the D-2 (+) implanted W, the permeability was recovered by heating at 1173 K and it was almost consistent with that for un-damaged W. In the case of C+ implanted , the permeability was not recovered even if the sample was heated at 1173 K, indicating that the existence of carbon would prevent the recovery of permeation path in W. In addition, transmission electron microscope (TEM) observation showed the voids were grown by heating at 1173 K and not removed, showing the existence of damages would not largely influence on the hydrogen permeation behavior in W in the present study.

By virtue of these FCA-IX assemblies, where the simple combinations of uranium fuel and diluent (graphite and stainless steel) in their core regions were systematically varied, the neutron spectra of these benchmark models cover those of various reactor types, from fast to sub-moderated reactors. The sample calculations of the benchmark models by a continuous-energy Monte Carlo (MC) code showed obvious differences between even the latest versions of two major nuclear data libraries, JENDL-4.0 and ENDF/B-VII.1. The present benchmark models would be well suited for the assessment and improvement of the nuclear data for U-235, U-238, graphite, and stainless steel. In addition, the verification of the deterministic method was performed on the benchmark models by comparison with the MC calculations. The present benchmark models are also available to users of deterministic calculation codes for the assessment and improvement of nuclear data.

The combined sFISH group comprised 29 men with a mean internal red bone marrow dose of 21.0 mGy and a mean external gamma-ray dose of 541 mGy. The G-banding group comprised 23 men with a mean internal red bone marrow dose of 23.0 mGy and a mean external gamma-ray dose of 315 mGy. Results: Observed translocation frequencies corresponded to expectations based on age and external gamma-ray dose with no need to postulate a contribution from alpha-particle irradiation of the red bone marrow by internally deposited plutonium. Frequencies of stable cells with complex aberrations, including insertions, were similar to those in a group of controls and a group of workers with external radiation exposure only, who were studied concurrently. In a similar comparison there is some suggestion of an increase in cells with unstable complex aberrations and this may reflect recent direct exposure to circulating lymphocytes. Conclusions: Reference to in vitro dose response data for the induction of stable aberrant cells by alpha-particle irradiation indicates that the low red bone marrow alpha-particle radiation doses received by the Sellafield workers would not result in a discernible increase in translocations, thus supporting the in vivo findings. Therefore, the greater risk from occupational radiation exposure of the bone marrow resulting in viable chromosomally aberrant cells comes from, in general, much larger cray exposure in comparison to alpha-particle exposure from plutonium.

Lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) is selected as target material. The subcritical fuel core is conceptually divided into ten equidistant subzones. The ceramic (natural U, Pu)O-2 fuel mixture and the materials used for radioisotope production (copper, gold, cobalt, holmium, rhenium, thulium, mercury, palladium, thallium, molybdenum, and yttrium) are separately prepared as cylindrical rods cladded with carbon/carbon composite (C/C) and these rods are located in the subzones. In order to obtain the flattened power density, percentages of PuO2 in the mixture of UO2 and PuO2 in the subzones are adjusted in radial direction of the fuel zone. Time-dependent calculations are performed at 1000MW thermal fission power (P-th) for one hour using the BURN card. The neutronic results show that the investigated ADS has a high neutronic capability, in terms of medical radioisotope productions, spent fuel transmutation and energy multiplication. Moreover, a good quasiuniform power density is achieved in each material case. The peak-to-average fission power density ratio is in the range of 1.02-1.28.

This research program includes the construction of the moderator circulation test (MCT) facility, production of the validation data for self-reliant computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools, and development of optical measurement system using the particle image velocimetry (PIV). In the present paper we introduce the scaling analysis performed to extend the scaling criteria suitable for reproducing thermal-hydraulic phenomena in a scaled-down CANDU-(CANada Deuterium Uranium-) 6 moderator tank, a manufacturing status of the 1/4 scale moderator tank. Also, preliminary CFD analysis results for the full-size and scaled-down moderator tanks are carried out to check whether the moderator flow and temperature patterns of both the full-size reactor and scaled-down facility are identical.

Elemental Analysis and Natural Radioactivity Levels of Clay by Gamma Ray Spectrometer and Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis	SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF NUCLEAR INSTALLATIONS			English	Article							BUILDING-MATERIALS; RADIATION HAZARDS; DWELLINGS	Due to increased global demand for clay, the present work involves the use of INAA for elemental analysis and pollutants concentration in clay. The samples were collected from Aswan in South Egypt. The samples were irradiated using the thermal neutrons "at the TRIGA Mainz research reactor" and at a neutron flux "of 7 x 10 n/cms". Twenty-six elements quantitatively and qualitatively were specified for the first time upon studying the samples. The elements determined are U, Th, Ta, Hf, Lu, Eu, Ce, Ba, Sn, Nb, Rb, Zn, Co, Fe, Cr, Sc, Sm, La, Yb, As, Ga, K, Mn, Na, Ti, and Mg. The concentrations of natural radionuclides Th-232, Ra-226, and K-40 were also calculated. Based on these concentrations, to estimate the exposure risk for using clay as raw materials in building materials, the radiation hazard indices such as radium equivalent activities, effective doses rate, and the external hazard indices have been computed. The obtained results were compared with analogous studies carried out in other countries and with the UNSCEAR reports.	[Alharbi, W.

Assessment of the soil quality by fuzzy mathematics in farmland around a uranium mill tailing repository in China	RADIOPROTECTION			English	Article						Uranium mill tailing; radionuclide; heavy metal; organochlorine pesticides; fuzzy mathematics	POLLUTION	Based on statistical analysis of the concentrations of multiple contaminants such as radionuclides, heavy metals and organochlorine pesticides in soil samples, the soil quality of a large piece of farmland around a uranium mill tailing (UMT) pond was assessed by fuzzy mathematics. This study found that the concentrations of U, Th, Cd, Pb and DDT in all sampling sites and Cr in sites 1 and 2 were above the standard values, indicating the effects of the UMTs. We also detected residual OCPs in all soil samples in the study area. The fuzzy mathematics assessment showed that the farmland soil quality around the uranium mill tailing pond at site 1 belongs to class II, while sites 2-6 belong to class I. Based on the above conclusions, in the present study most of the farmland soils were suitable for growing crops except for the areas near the UMT pond (0-500 meters).

Radiological hazard in the sediment of the Xining section of the Huangshui River, China	RADIOPROTECTION			English	Article						radionuclide; gamma-ray spectrometry; radiation hazard; gamma dose rate; sediment	NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; BUILDING-MATERIALS	Natural radioactivity was determined in sediment samples collected from the Xining section of the Huangshui River in northwest China. The activity concentrations of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 in the sediment samples range from 15.8 to 65.3, 24.3 to 86.0 and 432.6 to 702.4 Bq.kg(-1) with an average of 32.4, 43.0 and 527.5 Bq.kg(-1), respectively. All investigated sediment samples have radium equivalent activity lower than the limit of 370 Bq.kg(-1) and an external hazard index less than unity. The mean outdoor air absorbed dose rate is 63.5 nGy.h(-1) and the corresponding outdoor annual effective dose rate is 0.078 mSv.y(-1). The radiation level of the studied location is safe, and the sediment can be safely used in construction according to the current norms.

Kamachi			Light scattering investigation of the hydrolyzed thorium(IV) colloids and polymers	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Thorium(IV); Hydrolysis; Colloids; Polymers; Light scattering	COMPLEXES; CLUSTERS; CORE	The hydrolytic polymerization of Th(IV) has been investigated by light scattering technique in 10-20 mM and 0.05-0.4 M Th(IV) solutions. The present investigation shows that well defined colloids are formed at two different Th concentration and pH domains. The initially formed colloids at lower concentration are larger than those formed at higher concentration, which may be due to more crystalline nature of colloids formed at higher concentration. The colloidal polymers formed are of high molecular weight. The results of this work are a clear indication that Th(IV) hydrolysis do not differ from hydrolysis of Pu(IV).
