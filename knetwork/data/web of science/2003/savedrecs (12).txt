Significant results were obtained during the development of the thermal neutron emitter based on a neutron generator with a neutron energy of E = 2.5 MeV. The constructed emitter had an adequately high and uniform flux of thermal neutrons in the control chamber with the dimensions of 500 x 400 x 130 mm(3), and a maximum flux of thermal neutrons of 4.1 x 10(-4) neutrons/cm(2) s per one neutron from the generator. The three channels for detecting fissionable materials (by natural gamma-radiation, by delayed neutron and gamma-radiation) have been developed. This proposed method of detecting explosive is based on an acknowledged practice of thermal neutron analysis with scintillation detectors for the measurement of the capture gamma-radiation of nitrogen contained in explosive materials.

However,. in long-term, unattended storage scenarios, it is vital that the analysis of this count rate account for perturbations in the count rate caused by drifting equipment response, and changes in natural (radon levels, for example) or man-made background. In this paper, we report the long-term behavior of 420 silicon P-I-N diode's used as radiation detectors. Data were obtained over the course of 16-20 months at both 1-h and 1-min intervals, and, in addition to perfectly stable count rates, effects attributable to equipment failure, long-term gain drift, short-term gain drift, and software failures were observed. The results of statistical analyses of the time series will be given as well as a description of an event classification algorithm. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

An associated particle neutron generator uses this spatial correlation to infer the neutron trajectory by detecting the alpha particle. This technique can be used to suppress backgrounds and in building three-dimensional images using the return excitation gamma-ray energy due to the neutron interactions. The critical-performance component of the system is the alpha detection element, which is embedded within the neutron generator accelerator head. This element must be highly efficient, capable of nanosecond timing, and robust under the temperature changes encountered during manufacture. ZnO(Ga) scintillator coatings of differing thicknesses, with and without Ni overcoatings, were evaluated for this purpose, when excited by alpha particles between 3.2 and 5.4MeV. Average light output of up to 61 photoelectrons per event was measured. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The laboratories that supply these isotopic standards often do not quantify the plutonium mass. Knowledge of total plutonium mass in the sources is important for verifying the performance of passive neutron counters. The independent determination of total plutonium mass by gamma-ray techniques is rendered difficult by the lack of adequate information regarding the sample matrix and containment of the sources. Therefore, a technique that did not require knowledge of the sample matrix or containment was used to determine the plutonium masses. The technique was based on empirically extrapolating the apparent mass as a function of photon energy to conditions approximating zero photon attenuation. It was tested using measurements performed with three certified reference materials supplied by the New Brunswick Laboratory (NBL). Results were compared to those obtained from a high-efficiency neutron counter calibrated using Cf-252. The weighted average of the ratio of gamma ray to HENC plutonium masses was determined to be 0.942 +/- 0.029. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

A power law dependence of the form alpha(T) = kA(x) was used to describe the specific yield function. The best-fit value of x was 0.55+/-0.13. The same experimental arrangement generated results for the specific coincidence neutron production rate, alpha(R), which is directly proportional to the second factorial moment of the emitted neutron multiplicity distribution. alpha(R) was also well represented by a power law with an exponent value of 1.85+/-0.14. Absolute production rates vary with location (latitude, altitude, overhead shielding) and time (seasonal, solar activity and atmospheric pressure dependence); however, the scaling rules are expected to remain valid. These results are applicable to estimating matrix-dependent background rates in low-level passive neutron assay of plutonium. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Piston rings were made radioactive by neutron activation and blocks were activated by surface layer activation. With this radiotracer system, top compression ring wear can be determined to better than +/-5 mug/h and cylinder-bore wear can be determined to better than +/-1 nm/h simultaneously in a 1 h measurement period. This sensitivity is superior to any other real-time wear measurement system currently available. High-sensitivity wear data is necessary to develop engine hardware and lubrication systems that will prevent excessive wear over the life of the engine. Details of the design and operation of the wear measurement system are presented as well as representative data on a production V6 SI engine. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The realization that one can investigate nuclei at extreme conditions such as high density, temperature, and angular momentum using several sophisticated experimental innovations opened up the possibility of extending this activity to the study of these systems when more neutrons or more protons are added. The so called exotic nuclei constitute a major research activity in Japan, France, USA, Canada, Germany and other countries. More laboratories are going through the process of redirection of their experimental effort towards this activity. The nuclear physics community in Brasil has enthusiastically decided to join this endeavor to provide the Pelletron/LINAC complex with two superconducting solenoids which will permit the production of secondary beams of radioactive nuclei. A description of this facility and project RIBRAS follows. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper describes the method being developed to quantify different isotopes separately by using online prompt and delayed neutron measurements from the fission of isotopes such as U-235, U-238, Pu-241 and Pu-241. The system uses a new generation 14 MeV pulsed neutron generator the emission of which is about 2 x 10(9) n s(-1). The association of the differential die-away technique technique [W.E. Kunz, J.D. Atencio, J.T. Caldwell, A 1 nCi/g sensitivity transuranic waste assay system using pulsed neutron interrogation, INMM Annual meeting, Palm Beach, Florida. LA-UR-90-1794, CONF-800655-4 (1980)] (Differential Die-away Technique) and the SPHINCS method [Nucl. Instr. and Meth. B 160 (2000) 280-289] (Sequential PHoton Interrogation and Neutron Counting Signatures) allows measurement of the prompt and delayed neutrons from thermal and fast-induced fission after each interrogating pulse. This method is demonstrated by the measurement of uranium and plutonium samples. Samples of U + Pu have also been analysed inside a non-active drum of bituminized coating for the purpose of demonstrating the feasibility of the separation of U-235 from Pu-239 by this method. Moreover, the influence of U-238 and the necessity of correcting its effects have been studied. Finally, the purpose is to determine the best estimated value for each mass of interest associated with its own standard deviation and statistical distribution. Hence a specific method, based on the Monte Carlo trials, has been developed to estimate masses and associated uncertainties for each isotope of interest. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The effects of the presence of clay on uranium diffusion into the granite were analysed. It has been shown that. uranium diffuses into the granite either in the presence or in the absence of bentonite, but in presence of the clay, the, diffusion coefficient is two orders of magnitude lower. Different diffusion paths were clearly observed in both cases: the uranium in solution penetrates in the rock specifically through certain minerals (Fe-Ti bearing ones), whereas in presence of the clay, the main uranium diffusion paths are defects of the rock (grain boundaries, micro-fractures).

In this first of two companion papers, procedures used for chemical analyses and the analyzed data are presented. There is good agreement between the current results and previous results obtained at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Therefore, these analytical results could serve as a benchmark for future calculations and validation of nuclear data libraries. Such a validation is attempted in the companion paper.

In order to resolve nuclear database discrepancies, capture cross-section profiles between 0.1 eV and 30 keV have been measured for different materials using a lead-slowing-down-time spectrometer in association with a pulsed neutron generator. The measurement of the neutron flux with a U-233 fission detector and a He-3 counter, and careful analysis of the E-t correlation compared to very precise Monte Carlo simulations, brought new information on the lead scattering cross section. Capture profiles for reference materials (gold, tantalum, indium, and silver), core materials (thorium and technetium), and structure materials (manganese and nickel) were measured with a CeF3 scintillator and photomultiplier for different thicknesses. Areas of agreement and disagreement between experimental results and simulations using different databases have been determined with a precision of 5%. Correction tables are given for some elements. This method opens an efficient way for revisiting (n, gamma) databases, and it allows rapid error evaluation and sensitivity studies.

The existing core is being slowly expanded by substituting the earlier fuel with hyperstoichiometric (U0.45Pu0.55)C1+x fuel for operation of the reactor at full power [40 MW(thermal)] and at higher linear heat rating of the fuel. To evaluate the fuel in terms of its in-reactor performance, some of the important out-of-pile thermophysical and thermomechanical property data like the coefficient of thermal expansion, thermal difiusivity, thermal conductivity, and hot hardness have been generated as a function of temperature. The out-of-pile chemical compatibility of the fuel with Type 316 stainless steel (20% cold-worked) cladding material has also been established experimentally. From the data generated in these measurements, it has been concluded that with this fuel the reactor could be operated at full power with a fuel linear heat rating of 400 W/cm. Out-of-pile compatibility experiments indicate that carburization of the clad by carbon transfer from the fuel would not be severe to cause any breach of clad during the residence time of the fuel in the reactor.

J	Liu, JS; Neretnieks, I				Liu, JS; Neretnieks, I			Study of the consequences of secondary water radiolysis surrounding a defective canister	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						secondary water radiolysis; spent fuel dissolution; mathematical modeling	SPENT FUEL; OXIDATIVE DISSOLUTION; MODEL	In the concept of deep geological disposal of spent nuclear fuel, a chemically reducing environment in the near field of a repository is favorable for retaining the radionuclides in the fuel. Water radiolysis can possibly change a reducing environment in the near field to an oxidizing environment. In this paper, the consequences of secondary water radiolysis, caused by radionuclides released from the spent nuclear fuel and dispersed in the bentonite buffer surrounding a canister, have been studied. The canister is assumed to be initially defective with a hole of a few millimeters on its wall. The small hole will considerably restrict the transport of oxidants through the canister wall and the release of radionuclides to the outside of the canister. The spent fuel dissolution is assumed to be controlled by chemical kinetics at rates extrapolated from experimental studies. Two cases are considered. In the first case it is assumed that secondary phases of radionuclides [such as amorphous Pu(OH)(4) and AmOHCO3] do not precipitate inside the canister. The model results show that a relatively large domain of the near field can be oxidized by the oxidants of secondary radiolysis. In the second case it is assumed that secondary phases of radionuclides precipitate inside the canister, and the radionuclide concentration within the canister is controlled by its respective solubility limit. The amount of radionuclides released out of the canister will then be limited by the solubility of the secondary phases. The effect of the secondary radiolysis outside the canister on the rate of spent fuel oxidation inside a defective canister will be quite limited and can be neglected for any practical purposes in this case.

At certain beam options, a cascade of neutron-producing processes leaves the alpha-emitting spallation products belonging to the class of rare earths, like Sm-146(62), Gd-148(64), Gd-150(64) and Dy-154(64), whose overall toxicity in a lead target might overrun the alpha-emitting activation product Po-210(84). To suppress their accumulation, the concept of a heterogeneous liquid-metal spallation module is proposed. This concept envisages the separation of a spallation target into two zones with specifically designated roles of neutron production and neutron multiplication. The main idea is to localize the proton-induced neutron production in a material with Z number <60 so as to exclude accumulation of problematic rare earths. Radioactive Sn-126(50) from fission products is considered as a material for this zone. Such a configuration not only lifts the great deal of spallation product burden from the lead target but also helps in eliminating the most troublesome long-lived fission ash, and what is important is that, compared to the bulk lead target, there is no appreciable detrimental effect on the overall neutron production.

J	Marmy, P; Luppo, M				Marmy, P; Luppo, M			Effect of hydrogen on the fracture toughness of the titanium alloys Ti6Al4V and Ti5Al2.5Sn before and after neutron irradiation	PLASMA DEVICES AND OPERATIONS			English	Article						titanium alloys; mechanical properties; radiation effects	FATIGUE PROPERTIES; TENSILE; TI-6AL-4V	Titanium alloys are considered as potential candidate structural materials for the first wall, the blanket and the magnetic coil structures of fusion reactors. Titanium alloys are interesting materials because of their high specific strength and low elastic modulus, their good resistance to radiation damage and their fast induced radioactivity decay. The attachment of the first wall modules of the ITER FEAT fusion reactor is designed using flexible connectors made from titanium alloys. Two classical industrially available alloys, the monophase alpha Ti5Al2.4Sn alloy and the duplex alpha + beta Ti6Al4V alloy are candidate materials for the application. Titanium alloys with an alpha structure are believed to have a good resistance against radiation embrittlement and alpha + beta alloys should possess the best tolerance to hydrogen embrittlement. Hydrogen has been loaded in the material using a Sievert's apparatus operated at 750degreesC. The study concentrates on two hydrogen levels, 150 wppm at which no hydrides are expected in both alloys and 400 wppm were hydrides could form in the alloys. The fracture toughness is measured using mini charpy specimens tested in a three point bend fixture. The 3 x 4 x 27 mm mini charpys have been irradiated in the DR3 reactor of RISO in Denmark, at 60degreesC and 350degreesC to a dose of 0.1 dpa. The specimen have been cracked to a/w = 0.5 after irradiation. The fracture toughness properties of both alloys is reported as a function of the hydrogen level, before and after irradiation.

The transmutation scenario includes repeating periods of neutron irradiation in dual-purpose Fusion Power Reactor-Tokamak (FPRT) with Deuterium-Tritium plasma as neutron source and periods of Partitioning and Reprocessing (P&R) of fuel between the irradiation cycles. FPRT is intended for power production and SNF burning. The investigations are based on the results of an RF DEMO-S project with a fusion power of 2.5 GW and a modified blanket including fuel assemblies with minor actinides (Np, Am, Cm) and selected fission products (I-129, Tc-99, Cs-135, Zr-93, Pd-107, Sn-126). All obtained results are in conceptual stage and detailed engineering investigations will be required in case of the concept approval for imbedding in the total nuclear fuel cycle.

Tritium exposure was as long as 2300 h. Calculated He-3 concentrations in the alloys reached 600 and 500 appm respectively. It was shown that after an initial increase of the alloy lattice parameter, its further decrease took place. Positron spectroscopy data have shown that simple defect concentration in the alloys was stable, but Helium bubble size and its concentration rose significantly during Tritium exposure. By microstructure investigation it was shown that Helium bubbles nucleation was uniform through the whole grain volume but bubble growth was observed predominantly along dislocations and grain boundaries. Tensile property investigations at high temperature (400degreesC) have revealed a significant elasticity decrease in the alloys under study.

The aim of this study was to assure the suitability of this method in the study of fault zones. For this purpose, a portable AlphaGUARD PQ 2000 device was used to detect the fracture zones along Qena-Safaga road, Eastern Desert, Egypt. Radon soil gas anomalies were found to be linearly distributed along NW-SE and NE-SW trends. Such directions agree well with the directions of the active fault deduced from earlier studies. Radon concentration in soil along the repeated three profiles was anomalously high in all fault zones by a factor of 3-6 above background values. In the profiles studied, the peaks recorded on the fault trace were found to be higher than the background. The analysis of the water samples collected from a well in the studied area showed that the HCO3 contents exceeded 1000 ppm, providing an additional evidence that the area under study is likely to be included within a major seismic belt. This study confirms strongly that radon gas and hydrochemical studies are a good tool for fault zones detection in similar areas. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the simple repositioning-technique proposed here, the muscovite external detector is repositioned track-side down on the grain mount after etching the induced tracks. The fossil tracks are counted by focussing on the grain surface through the external detector. The positioning precision allows track to track matching, and is useful for methodical research and dating of low-uranium and sediment samples, containing a mixture of high- and low-uranium grains.

Soil samples were collected from each rock type, sealed in I I plastic Marinelli beakers, and measured in the laboratory for 24 h each. From the measured gamma-ray spectra, activity concentrations were determined for Th-232 (range from 1.3 to 52.8 Bq kg(-1)), U-238 (from 0.9 to 90.3 Bq kg(-1)) and K-40 (from 13 to 894 Bq kg(-1)). Elemental concentrations mean values of (2.8 +/- 0.7) ppm, (1.3 +/- 0.3) ppm and (0.6 +/- 0.1)% were extracted, for thorium, uranium and potassium, respectively.

The experimental setup has been chosen to simulate closely the situation in a commercial irradiation facility. The purpose of this study is twofold: compare activation of medical devices with regulatory limits and evaluate corresponding dose exposure of persons in contact with those devices. Samples of medical devices, classified in several test groups, were, located in a stack of low-density material at the position of the highest photoneutron fluence and irradiated to X-ray doses between 25 and 30 kGy. The induced activities were measured with high purity germanium (HPGe) gamma ray spectrometers. The X-rays were generated, in a tantalum target using a 7.3 MeV electron beam with a narrow energy spread during the first experiment and with a broad energy spectrum for a second one. Results have been scaled to 50 kGy and compared with theoretical estimates. In addition, the radiation exposure of four categories of persons (logistics personnel in the irradiation facility, truck drivers, doctors and patients) has been calculated from the measured activities. The measured activities are higher than theoretical expectations but still below governmental regulations. The annual dose received by the person category with the highest exposure is about 1% of the worldwide average environmental exposure, and for other categories it is negligible. The paper concludes that provided some precautions are considered, sterilization with X-rays from 7.5 MeV electrons can be regarded safe from the standpoint of public health and personal safety.

Samples of meat and meat ash were located in a large volume of fresh meat at the position of the highest photoneutron fluence and irradiated to an X-ray dose of 15 kGy, twice the maximum dose allowed by the US FDA for meat irradiation. In order to evaluate the safety of treatment with any kind of electron accelerators, two experiments have been performed with different accelerators delivering electrons with a narrow and a broad energy spread. The measured activities and theoretical estimates are of the same order of magnitude. An evaluation of the corresponding radiation exposure from ingestion of the irradiated product has been compared to natural background radiation. The paper concludes that the risk to individuals from intake of food irradiated with X-rays from 7.5 MeV electrons, even with a broad energy spectrum, would be trivial.

Liquid metal-solid metal reactions is a joint effort of PSI and SUBATECH with the support from CNRS and the Institute of Physics from Riga. It has been initiated to explore whether or not liquid metal corrosion and liquid metal embrittlement are enhanced under irradiation in the presence of stress. Numerical simulations showed that the damage levels and gas production in thin specimens induced by 72 MeV protons are, within reasonable limits, comparable to those on the inside of the beam window of a spallation target at 600 MeV, while much less radioactivity is produced. The paper describes the basic features of the experiment, the technical concept of the liquid metal loop with a special emphasis on the test section exposed to the proton beam and some of the relevant safety aspects.

In addition to the displacement damage produced from the irradiation, up to several thousand atomic parts per million (appm) of hydrogen and helium were produced in the irradiated material via spallation reactions. Results of tensile tests at temperatures from room temperature up to 164degreesC show large increases in tensile yield strength, small increases in ultimate tensile strength, reductions in strain hardening capacity and reductions in ductility (uniform elongation and strain-to-necking) with increasing irradiation dose. A comparison of these data with the large database on tensile properties of type 316 stainless steel exposed to fission neutrons and tensile tested over the same temperature range show similar trends with regard to strength changes, but significantly larger reductions in ductility with irradiation dose were observed after irradiation in the spallation environment. The much higher amounts of helium and hydrogen produced through spallation in the LANSCE spectrum, compared to those developed in fission neutron irradiation environments at equivalent doses, may contribute to degradation in ductility.

The experiment is called WITCH, short for Weak Interaction Trap for CHarged particles, and is set up at the ISOLDE facility at CERN. The principle of the experiment and its realization are explained as well as the main physics goal. A cloud of radioactive ions stored in a Penning trap serves as the source for the WITCH experiment, leading to the minimization of scattering and energy loss of the decay products. The energy spectrum of the recoiling daughter ions from the beta-decays in this ion cloud will be measured with a retardation spectrometer. The principal aim of the WITCH experiment is to study the electroweak interaction by determining the beta-neutrino angular correlation in nuclear beta-decay from the shape of this recoil energy spectrum. This will be the first time that the recoil energy spectrum of the daughter ions from beta-decay can be measured for a wide variety of isotopes, independent of their specific properties.

The efficiency curve was measured in the energy range of 120 keV-12.2 MeV for the first time, using the combination of proton-capture nuclear reactions and radioactive sources, such as Co-56, Co-60, Ga-66 and Eu-152. At high energies gamma-ray pairs from proton resonance capture on Al-27, Na-23, K-39 and B-11 were employed using evaporated Al, Na2WO4, K2SO4 and LiBO2 targets, respectively. The experimental data were fitted with a single polynomial function on log-log scale using a recently developed method. The add-back factor is found to increase quadratically with the energy, in contrast to the previously suggested linear relationship. The efficiency gain with respect to a single detector is about one order of magnitude at 10 MeV energy. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Either a triton or an alpha particle produced through the interaction of a neutron with Li-6 changes an SSG into normal state. Each transition in the collection is clearly shown to be counted. This method indicates a possibility of highly efficient detection of ultra-cold neutrons, because their conventional detectors work well only at room temperature. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Sayareh, R; Maragheh, MG; Shamsaie, M				Sayareh, R; Maragheh, MG; Shamsaie, M			Theoretical calculations for the production of Mo-99 using natural uranium in Iran	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							RESEARCH REACTOR	In the field of medical diagnostics, Tc-99m with a half life of 6 h is widely used for medical purposes and produced from the decay of Mo-99 (t(1/2)=66 h). The need for this isotope in the Iranian medical centres is about 20 Ci/week and is currently being imported. In this paper. the theoretical calculations related to the production of Mo-99. using natural UO2 and irradiating it within the Tehran Research Reactor are presented. The calculations are carried out by the use of the MCNP-4A and ORIGEN-2 codes. It is expected that following chemical separations, approximately 20 Ci/week of Mo-99 may be obtained by irradiating 100 g of natural UO2 for a period of 7 days inside the reactor, This amount may be produced every other week due to the limitations on the reactor operation. Detailed calculations have been presented to the proper regulatory bodies for approval. Once authorized. the production is expected to begin in the first half of 2003. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Kernkraftwerk Leibstadt AG, Kernkraftwerk Gosgen-Daniken AG. BKW FMB Energie AG and Nordostschweizerische Kraftwerke AG]. The measurements have covered an 80-cm long region of the SVEA-96+ assembly involving two important axial heterogeneities: (a) the enrichment boundary separating the lower axial region (average 215 U enrichment of 4.02 wt.%, 14 burnable absorber fuel pins) from the upper axial region (average 215 U enrichment of 3.70 wt.% 16 burnable absorber fuel pins), and (b) the presence of spacers at about 12 cm below this enrichment boundary. The experimental results have been compared to HELIOS/ PRESTO-2 calculated values at three different levels, by means of radial point-wise. axial point-wise and axial node-wise comparisons. The results show good agreement (typically within 2%) between HELIOS/PRESTO-2 nodal pin powers and corresponding experimental values, with the largest discrepancy of 6-9% being highly localised in a pin subject to strong flux gradients and spectral interactions, Further improvements would require explicit three-dimensional lattice calculations and the development of three-dimensional pin power reconstruction methods.

We prepared the lipophilic complex Y-90-oxine with a radiolabeling efficiency of 97.6 +/- 1.1%. After extraction into ethiodol, a stability test in serum at 37degreesC showed that 87.8% of the Y-90 remained ethiodol-bound for 7 days. Bremsstrahlung imaging of a rabbit for 48 h confirmed that the homogeneous mixture of radiolabeled Y-90-oxine and ethiodol stayed in the targeted liver lobe. This radiopharmaceutical is thus a potential candidate for the treatment of non-resectable liver cancer. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cosmic-ray-induced background is suppressed by means of active shield devices consisting of plastic scintillating plates of 50mm thick and anti-coincidence electronic system. The observed background rate was 0.34 s(-1) (= 0.12 s(-1) per 100 cm(3) Ge volume) for energy regions between 50 and 3000 keV. The detection efficiency curve for 10(3) ml Marinelli beaker samples is obtained over all the energy regions. The advantages of the method are demonstrated by measuring the activity of Cs-137 in powdered milk sample prepared without taking any chemical procedure. The MDA for Cs-137 is estimated to be (17 +/- 1.7) mBq at a confidence level of 95% and it is about a factor of 10 lower than the MDA obtained from the previous cryostat assembly with 10-cm thick lead shielding.

The initial idea of Schwerdtel and practical realization and elaboration of the TDCR method by Pochwalski is presented. The main aspects and theoretical principle of the method are summarized and progress on the development of the theoretical model is presented. The details of the activity determination of pure beta- and pure EC radionuclides are discussed, along with specific details in the application of the method in each case. The enhanced TDCR method based on the MAC3 electronic system developed in France is also discussed. Different applications of the TDCR method in metrology laboratories around the,world are also pointed out. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The activity value determined at BIPM was in good agreement with that stated by LNHB (the difference was 0.3%). Additional measurements of Zn-65 activity and half-life were also carried out, by using a (47)pigamma ionization chamber; the half-life value proposed by this work: 244.15 (10) days, is consistent to others reported in the literature. The spectra analysis was performed by gamma-ray spectrometry with high-purity germanium detectors, with the aim to improve the accuracy of the photon emission probabilities values of this nuclide. The determined photon emission probabilities are 0.498 for the 1115 keV gamma-ray, 0.347 and 0.0479 for the X-rays Cu-K-alpha and Cu-K-beta; the associated uncertainties are 0.4%, 0.9% and 1.1%, respectively.

This makes possible further safe operation of deep waste disposal sites at the Mining-Chemical Plant and the Siberian Chemical Plant. The toxicity and temperature in a formation with the wastes removed are used as the assessment criteria, satisfaction of which guarantees that the wastes will remain localized within the assigned boundaries of the waste-disposal formation site. It is concluded that the standard limit should be imposed on the specific activity of the long-lived group of radionuclides - 90Sr and 137Cs - rather than on the total specific activity of the wastes placed in deep disposal sites. For maximum specific activity of 90Sr and 137Cs of 37 GBq/dm3 and total specific activity not exceeding 185 GBq/dm3 for buried wastes with radionuclide composition characteristic of modern radiochemical production operations, it is impossible for potentially dangerous radiation and thermochemical processes to occur in the waste-disposal formation site. The recommended limit permits reducing substantially the volume of buried wastes and therefore the region over which the wastes propagate in the deep disposal site.

Steps to this end were initiated early on when the first nuclear power plants were commissioned in the 1960s. They resulted, among other approaches, in the decisions and site selection procedures for the Gorleben salt dome and the former Konrad iron ore mine as potential repository sites in the 1970s and 1980s. In 2000, the federal government imposed a moratorium of three up to a maximum of ten years on further exploration activities at Gorleben in order to dispel doubts held by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, and Nuclear Safety (BMU). A positive plans approval decision on Konrad was publicized in May 2002. Emplacement could begin roughly in 2010-2012, once legal certainty will nave been ensured. In February 1999, BMU appointed a working party to establish site selection procedures for repositories (AkEnd) which was to develop a transparent procedure of finding and selecting sites for the final storage of all kinds of radioactive waste in Germany. The procedure finally proposed by AkEnd implies considerable uncertainty, inter alia, about its legal implementability, the time required, and funding. For the Gorleben salt dome, for instance, additional exploration and procedures alone could give rise to extra costs of euro 3-5 billion, compared to merely continuing project activities. Similar extra costs are likely to arise especially to the government if emplacement in Konrad were to be delayed. Under aspects of technical safety, the speediest possible emplacement of all types of waste in deep geologic formations is preferable to all other options. Hence, further exploration of Gorleben should be completed quickly, and the Konrad project should be implemented, after due consideration of all factors.

Ongoing operation of nuclear power plants and, especially, the increasing rate of decommissioning and demolition of power reactors add to the need to plan for the management of waste arising in operation and demolition. Most of the existing interim storage capacity has been earmarked for waste arising in plant operation. It will become necessary to create additional interim storage capacity in order to allow plants to be decommissioned and demolished speedily and, at the same time, make the necessary provisions for interim storage pending final storage. Government institutions and research centers (FZK, FZJ VKTA, and EWN) created new storage capacity in recent years. The waste arising from decommissioning and demolition of the Hanau nuclear plants will also be emplaced in a new on-site interim store. At a number of sites where power reactors are going to be decommissioned and demolished, operators also are planning for new interim storage capacity for radioactive waste. An overview is given of the on-site interim stores newly built and the new interim stores currently in the planning phase on various sites where plants are to be dismantled.

Plastic shells will be permeation filled at room temperature then cooled to cryogenic temperatures before removal of the overpressure. The cryogenic pressure loader (CPL) was recently developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory as a testbed for studying the filling and layering of plastic target shells with DT A technical description of the CPL is provided. The CPL consists of a cryostat; which contains a high-pressure permeation cell, and has optical access for investigating beta layering. The cryostat is housed within a tritium glovebox that contains manifolds for supplying high-pressure DT The CPL shares some design elements with the cryogenic target handling system at the OMEGA facility to allow testing of tritium issues related to that system. The CPL has the capability to fill plastic targets by permeation to pressures up to 100 MPa and to cool them to 15 K. The CPL will accommodate a range of targets and may be modified for future experiments.

Previously, gold was deposited on shells while they were agitated to obtain uniform, reproducible coatings. However, these coatings were rather impermeable, resulting in unacceptably long fill times. We report here on an initial study on Pd coatings on shells in the same manner. We have found that these palladium-coated shells are substantially more permeable than gold. Pd coatings on shells remained stable on exposure to deuterium. Pd coatings had lower reflectivity compared to gold that leads to a lower working temperature, and efficiency, of the proposed fusion reactor. Seeking to combine the permeability of Pd coatings and high reflectivity of gold, AuPd-alloy coatings were produced using a cosputtering technique. These alloys demonstrated higher permeability than Au and higher reflectivity than Pd. However, these coatings were still less reflective than the gold coatings. To improve the permeability of gold's coatings, permeation experiments were performed at higher temperatures. With the parameters of composition, thickness, and temperature, we have the ability to comply with a large target design window.

This facility is designed to supply 500000, 4-mm-outer diameter targets per day-coated via interfacial polycondensation, dried with supercritical CO2, sputter coated with Au and/or Pd, and filled with deuterium-tritium layered at cryogenic temperatures and injected into the fusion chamber. Such targets would be used in a direct-drive IFE power plant. The work uses manufacturing processes being developed in the laboratory, chemical engineering scaleup principles, and established cost-estimating methods. The plant conceptual design includes a process flow diagram, mass and energy balances, equipment sizing and sketches, storage tanks, and facility views. The cost estimate includes both capital and operating costs. Initial results for a TFF dedicated to one 1000-MW(electric) plant indicate that the costs per target are well within the commercially viable. range. Larger TFF plants [3000 MW(electric)] are projected to lead to significantly reduced costs per injected target. Additional cost reductions are possible by producing dried, sputter-coated empty shells at a central facility that services multiple power plants. The results indicate that the installed capital cost is about $100 million and the annual operating costs will be about $20 million, for a cost per target of about $0.17 each. These design and cost projections assume that a significant process development and scaleup program is successfully completed for all of the basic unit operations included in the facility.

Assuming high-yield fusion pulses (of 1 to 20 GJ per shot at a rate Of 0.1 Hz), we consider a unique shock and energy absorbing system to contain the energy. One concept answers the need for system standoff from the fusion reaction with a replaceable mechanical cartridge manufactured on-site. System studies suggest integrated blanket designs for absorbing the fusion energy, cartridge manufacture of recycled materials, and cartridge installation/replacement to maintain a reasonable duty cycle. An effective system design for ZP-3 requires an integrated blanket to shield the permanent structures from the high-energy neutron flux and strong shock wave, breed tritium, and simultaneously absorb the released fusion energy. We investigate the feasibility of this integrated blanket concept and explore the principles of a containment chamber-a crucible - and the containment mechanisms. An operational cycle is proposed to physically load hardware in 10-s intervals while maintaining operational conditions. Preliminary pressure and shock calculations demonstrate that high-yield inertial fusion energy pulses can be contained if the appropriate energy-absorbing materials are used.

In the release primary phase, the important factors are the boundary conditions: atmospheric and geometric grid from the point of emission. The second phase occurs when the tritium is deposited in the ground. This phase is important in order to account for the dosimetric effects of tritium, and it is a key factor in the chronic and collective doses of the population. The final internal irradiation dose is calculated as the addition of doses by ingestion, by inhalation of the primary plume, by absorption on the skin, and inhalation by reemission to the atmosphere. Each of the two chemical forms (HT and HTO) of tritium present in the environment from potential IFE reactor releases contributes in different ways to the most exposed individual and the committed effective dose equivalent (50-CEDE). The HTO presents a much larger percentage of the internal irradiation from inhalation and absorption through the skin than HT However, in releases where HT represents 100%, the contributions to the total effective dose by ingestion and reemission are important.

Lung clearance was described by a two-compartment exponential model with half-times of 110 d and 10,000 d. The observed uptake of Am-241 in the liver (72 Bq) and skeleton (170 Bq) was significantly greater than predicted by the ICRP models for liver (5 Bq) and skeleton (8 Bq). The half-time in the liver was approximately 850 d. Estimates of skeletal activity based on head, wrist, and knee counts generally agreed within 25% over the course of the monitoring period. The half-time in the skeleton was approximately 20,000 d.
