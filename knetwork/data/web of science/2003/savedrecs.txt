This will certainly be true in experiments such as ATLAS and CMS, which are currently being built to exploit the physics potential at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. If the levels of radioactivity and corresponding dose rates are significant, then there will be implications for any access or maintenance operations. This paper presents predictions for the radioactivation of ATLAS's Semi-Conductor Tracker (SCT) barrel system, based on both calculations and measurements. It is shown that both neutron capture and high-energy hadron reactions must be taken into account. The predictions also show that the SCT barrel-module should not pose any serious radiological problems after operation in high radiation environments. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two linear signals of different timings were input into a single module charge-sensitive analog-to-digital converter. The alpha-and the gamma-rays were discriminated by comparing the total charge integration of a pulse with the partial one. As a result, the alpha-rays energy spectrum with NaI(TI) was successfully and clearly extracted. The present work showed that the PSD method was performed by the minimum electronic circuits. The sensitivity was high enough to measure RIs of a few muBq/kg in high pure NaI crystals for dark matter search. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Due to the high penetration capability of slow neutrons through natural uranium and different attenuation properties for the individual uranium isotopes, a high sensitivity in respect to the enrichment in U-235 exists. Both the structural integrity and the material distribution inside the pellets can be determined by neutron imaging methods. This holds for fresh fuel before insertion into the reactor core but also for spent fuel after reloading and storage. In the latter case, more demanding effort with respect to shielding is needed and adapted detection methods have to be applied because of the high radiation background from the fuel itself. The facility NEUTRA at the spallation source SINQ is able to manage the high quality neutron imaging procedures with fuel, the special set-up NEURAP allows it to do such measurements with pellets of high burn-up too.

Atomic Energy Rev. 9 (1971) 547; Hashimoto, I., Deshpande, K.B. & Thomas, S.H. I & EC Fundamentals 3 (1964) 213]. Leaching tests were carried out in accordance with a method recommended by IAEA [Atomic Energy Rev. 9 (1971) 195]. Determination of retardation factors, K-F and coefficients of distribution, k(d), using a simplified mathematical model for analyzing the migration of radionuclides, has been developed. In our experiment we have achieved the lowest leaching values after 60 days. Results presented in this paper are examples of results obtained in a 20 year mortar and concrete testing project, which will influence the design of the engineered trenches system for a future central Serbian radioactive waste storage center.

These setups are intended to operate in power and transmutation electronuclear facilities, for which they permit decreasing substantially the required power of the proton accelerator. Theoretical and design works have been done on cascade-type blankets, but until very recently there were no experimental works. The results of the first experiment of this type, performed at the All-Russia Scientific-Research Institute of Experimental Physics, on compact deeply subcritical uranium-neptunium assemblies are presented. The experiment has confirmed the theoretical conclusion that cascade blankets have positive properties and Np-237 is effective as a means for achieving unilateral coupling of the sections.

The possibility of using fuel based on reprocessed uranium in VVER is analyzed. The requirements for the initial isotopic composition of test batches of fuel pellets with 4% effective enrichment are determined, the compensation coefficient is calculated, the requirements,for monitoring the isotopic composition are determined, and the technology for fabricating fuel pellets from relaimed fuel is determined. It is shown that the basic neutron-physical characteristics satisfy the restrictions adopted in the VVER-440 and -1000 designs. The effect of radiation on the public and the environment as a result of switching to fuel fabricated from reclaimed uranium is the same as for the standard oxide fuel.									0	3	3	0	3	CONSULTANTS BUREAU	NEW YORK	233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA	1063-4258			ATOM ENERGY+	Atom.

It is concluded on the basis of a generalization of the data from radiation testing of mononitride fuel with burnup up to 9-10% in fast and 16.8% in thermal reactors with lineal power density,from 400 to 1300 W/cm that it should operate reliably in fuel elements with helium and liquid-metal sublayers. The requirement for the impurity (oxygen and carbon) content in it is formulated. When both oxygen and carbon impurities are present simultaneously in mononitride, the mass traction of each should not exceed 0.15%. The methods for fabricating mononitride fuel are determined by the final product of the reprocessing of irradiated fuel. Consequently, methods for fabricating mixed nitride fuel from oxides and metals are now being developed.

They must be discussed in a transparent and credible fashion in order to achieve acceptance of nuclear power as an option for future energy supply. The European Commission is convinced that a common legal approach should constitute the framework for member countries within which to take individual decisions about the national role of nuclear power. This requires a number of measures to be taken, especially with regard to public interest. The EU Commission therefore put the so-called Nuclear Package up for discussion. The Nuclear Package contains proposals for a Community framework of legislation on nuclear safety in an enlarged European Union. The Nuclear Package deals with five main items: - The safety of nuclear installations and facilities in the present and the enlarged European Union. - Ensuring decommissioning and dismantling of nuclear installations by means of a fund solution. - Sustainable and safe management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste. - Focusing on optimum research and development of new technologies, including new approaches to waste management. - Trade in nuclear material and enrichment services between the EU countries and Russia.

However, just as often, extensive civilian (excess inventories of reactor operators and former strategic stockpiles) as well as military sources of supply (former weapons-grade material converted into reactor fuel) opened up unexpectedly. These so-called secondary sources had a major negative impact on uranium prices, resulting in a strong movement towards consolidation in the uranium industry and decreasing the number of producers. However, there have been more and more indications in the past few months that uranium could indeed become scarce on a medium term. The secondary sources still available to meet requirements are gradually declining, and even the conversion into nuclear fuel of more material from the weapons stockpiles of the two superpowers, United States and Russia, could postpone only slightly the point in time at which fuel would become scarce. This indicates the urgent need for a major increase in uranium production in the West. However, there may be considerable financial obstacles in the way of stepping up production in existing uranium mines and building and commissioning new ones. Should uranium producers be unable, or unwilling, to invest new uranium mines despite expected clear price increases, reactor operators could be called upon to invest part of their capital into new uranium mines and dressing facilities.

It was determined by two factors over the past twenty years: the decommissioning of capacities in U.S. gaseous diffusion plants, and the use of existing capacities in Russia. Given the slight increase in enrichment requirements over the next ten or fifteen years, replacing other decommissioned capacities in gaseous diffusion plants in the United States and in France is becoming an important subject of future significant investments. In contrast to past debates about technical and economic aspects, it is now a fact recognized worldwide that the centrifuge technology of uranium enrichment is the technology of the future. For the past thirty years, Urenco has been successful in developing centrifuges for uranium enrichment. Current economic Studies document the advantage in terms of prices over other enrichment technologies, which is due also to an up to sixtyfold reduction in power consumption compared to older gaseous diffusion plants. The modular design of plants, with its possibility of flexible adaptation to capacity requirements, has demonstrated its advantages on the market. Urenco continuously expanded its world market share from 7% in 1990 to 15% in 2002. In the light of foreseeable future market demands, the Urenco Group has been restructured. Since October 2003, enrichment services have been concentrated in the Urenco Enrichment Company (UEC), while centrifuge development and manufacture as well as construction and project management of enrichment facilities are now handled by the Enrichment Company Limited (ETC).									0	0	0	0	0	VERLAGSGRP HANDELSBLATT GMBH	DUSSELDORF	POSTFACH 10 11 02, D-40002 DUSSELDORF, GERMANY	1431-5254			ATW-INT J NUCL POWER	ATW-Int.

J	Heller, W				Heller, W			Amendment to the ordinance on advance contributions to a repository	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article								Amendment to the Ordinance on Advance Contributions to a Repository The Ordinance on Advance Contributions to a Repository entered into force on April 28, 1982. It provides for advance contributions to be collected towards meeting the expenditure required to build repositories for radioactive waste. It is the federal government's tool for financing its duty to ensure the final storage of radioactive waste. All sources of radioactive waste are required to make advance contributions. The ordinance is to be updated in the light of new technical findings as well as the new framework provided by the Atomic Energy Act in which the operating lives of nuclear power plants are limited by the electricity volumes generated. A draft to this effect has been submitted by the Federal Ministry for the Environment; it is to enter into force on February 1, 2004. Among other changes, the new provisions turn the old refinancing scheme into a scheme financing running expenditures. Equality of burdens and balanced contributions are to be achieved, and speedy adaptation to real changes is to be ensured. The question is raised whether the ordinance on Advance Contributions to a Repository can be used as a means of financing the proposals made by the Working Group on Repository Site Selection in looking for new repository sites.									0	0	0	0	0	VERLAGSGRP HANDELSBLATT GMBH	DUSSELDORF	POSTFACH 10 11 02, D-40002 DUSSELDORF, GERMANY	1431-5254			ATW-INT J NUCL POWER	ATW-Int.

Uniform layers have been successfully formed near the triple point. However, upon subsequent cooling the layers degrade. We report here recent attempts to form uniform deuterium hydride (HD) layers 1.5 K below the triple point using infrared (IR) radiation. Pumping the IR collisionally induced vibration-rotation band of solid HD contained inside a transparent plastic shell generates a volumetric heat source in the HD lattice. This in turn allows the formation of a spherical crystalline shell of HD inside the transparent plastic shell.

The energy released from such pulsed power tests results in fragmentation and vaporization of structures at the central wire array as well as shock wave propagation to the chamber boundaries. Practical design and safety considerations require that tracking of this shock front and the associated gas-debris field be done for a variety of experimental configurations to predict the arrival time of hazardous or radioactive debris at fast closure valve locations. A novel computational model has been developed to handle gas expansion into vacuum using a computer model (TEXAS) operating on a Eulerian mesh. Upon expansion of a high-pressure gas into a region of hard vacuum where free molecular transport dominates, the transport model switches between a traditional Eulerian continuum mechanics model and a free molecular transport model across the interface between the two regions. The interface location then propagates along the mesh as the gas expands. This new quasi-one-dimensional model (TEXAS-NCV) has been implemented and tested for two benchmark cases. Such a model can be useful in the design of inertial fusion systems.

J	Sanchez, JJ; Giedt, WH				Sanchez, JJ; Giedt, WH			Thin films for reducing tamping gas convection heat transfer effects in a national ignition facility Hohlraum	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Hohlraum; cryogenic; heat transfer		The effects of natural convection in the tamping gas in a vertical hohlraum on the heat flow from a frozen layer of deuterium and tritium (D-T) on the inner surface of a target capsule is investigated numerically. The energy released from tritium decay within the capsule is transferred through the tamping gas to the cooling rings on each end of the hohlraum. The thickness of the frozen layer must be uniform. This means that the heat flow from it to the capsule must be spherically symmetric and that the temperature of the inner surface of the D-T layer will be uniform and in equilibrium with its vapor. The objective of this study was to determine the combination of boundary conditions and thin films for restricting convection in the tamping gas, which satisfy these requirements. With the capsule mounted between two thin plastic films, clockwise-flow convection cells form in the upper and lower gas regions. When this flow contacts the capsule, the temperature variation along the inner surface of the D-T layer was as great as 3 mK. This was reduced to 180 muK by introducing thin films to isolate the capsule from the convection cells. Furth er reduction of this value to similar to50 muK was achieved by modifying the boundary conditions.

Two former nuclear materials processing facilities in Armstrong County Pennsylvania have been the focus of such public concern for over 20 y. The Apollo and Parks, facilities processed uranium and plutonium fuels for use in nuclear applications. To evaluate the possibility of increased cancer rates in the communities near the Apollo-Parks nuclear processing materials plants, cancer incidence rates were assessed for the years 1993-1997, or nearly 40 y after the plants had begun operation in 1957 and 1960, respectively. The rates of cancer were evaluated among the approximately 17,000 persons living in 1 of 8 municipalities encompassing or near these nuclear sites. Numbers of cancers and mailing addresses (n = 935) were obtained from the Pennsylvania Department of Health. Because mailing addresses in small rural areas do not always reflect actual residences within a municipality, each of 935 addresses was validated (and corrections made when indicated) by contacting area postmasters and using Census Bureau geocoding information, street maps, and aerial photographs. Standardized Incidence Ratios (SIRs) were computed as the ratio of observed numbers of cancers in the study area compared to the expected number derived from general population rates of Pennsylvania. Forty percent of the mailing addresses were found not to be within the boundaries of the study municipalities. After excluding these persons who did not reside in one of the eight municipalities near the Apollo-Parks facilities, 581 cancers remained in contrast to 574.0 expected (SIR 1.01; 95 % confidence interval 0.93-1.10). Based upon knowledge of the tissues where uranium or plutonium likely would be deposited.

J	Boice, JD; Bigbee, WL; Mumma, MT; Blot, WJ				Boice, JD; Bigbee, WL; Mumma, MT; Blot, WJ			Cancer mortality in counties near two former nuclear materials processing facilities in Pennsylvania, 1950-1995	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						uranium; radiation risk; health effects; epidemiology	CHILDHOOD LEUKEMIA; PLUTONIUM WORKERS; SITES; INSTALLATIONS; EXPOSURE; PROJECT; PLANT	There has been concern that living near nuclear installations might increase the risk of cancer, including childhood leukemia, in surrounding communities. Such concern has been voiced by residents in Armstrong and Westmoreland Counties in Western Pennsylvania in conjunction with the operation of two former nuclear materials processing facilities located in the Apollo borough and the Parks township, just three miles apart. These facilities began operating in 1957 and 1960 and processed uranium and plutonium for commercial and naval applications. To evaluate the possibility of increased cancer rates in communities around the Apollo-Parks nuclear facilities, a cancer incidence and a cancer mortality survey were conducted. The county mortality findings are reported here. Nearly 40,000 cancer deaths occurred in the population residing in Armstrong and Westmoreland Counties from 1950 through 1995. Each of these two study counties was matched for comparison to three control counties in the same region on the basis of age, race, urbanization, and socioeconomic factors available from the 1990 U.S. Census. There were over 77,000 cancer deaths in the 6 control counties during the 45 y studied. Following similar methods used by the National Cancer Institute, Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMRs) were computed as the ratio of observed numbers of cancers in the study and control counties compared to the expected number derived from general population rates of the United States. Relative risks (RR) were computed as the ratios of the SMRs for the study and the control counties. There were no significant increases in the study counties for any cancer when comparisons were made with either the U.S. population or the control counties. In particular, deaths due to cancers of the lung, bone, liver, and kidney were not more frequent in the study counties than in the control counties. These are the cancers of a priori interest given that uranium and/or plutonium might be expected to concentrate in these tissues. Deaths from all cancers combined also were not increased in the study counties, and the RRs of cancer mortality before the facilities operated (1950-1964), during plant operations (1965-1980) and after plant closure (1980-1995) were similar: 0.96, 0.95 and 0.98, respectively. For childhood leukemia mortality, the relative risk comparing the study counties with their controls before plant start-up was 1.02, while during operations (RR 0.81) and after closure (RR 0.57) the relative risks were lower. The study is limited by the correlational approach and the relatively large size of the geographic areas of the counties studied.

Intakes by inhalation and ingestion were calculated and used as input to the ICRP-30 model or a combination of the ICRP-66 lung model and the ICRP-67 metabolic model. The Pu-239,Pu-240 distribution in the lung, liver, skeleton, kidney, and muscle using the combination ICRP-66 and 67 models agreed well with the measured data. However, the measured plutonium concentration in the spleen was higher than predicted and than found in the kidney or muscle and indicates that the spleen should be treated as a separate organ in the ICRP model. The fractional uptake via ingestion of Pu-239,Pu-240 was estimated to be 11% with 5 X 10(-4) as the f(1) value. The combination of ICRP-66 and 67 models were adequate descriptors of the organ burdens of Am-241 measured in Akita and Niigata district populations. The Am-241 ingrowth from Pu-241 taken into in the human body contributes 90% of the measured burden.

J	Klemm, WJ; Brodsky, A; Schaeffer, DM				Klemm, WJ; Brodsky, A; Schaeffer, DM			Radioanalytical data interpretation when the ratio reading/median is lognormally distributed	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						bioassay; analysis, statistical; plutonium; detector, fission-track	FIT	The purpose of this paper is to assist those who might be confronted by non-normal and non-homoscedastic error distributions representable by continuous probability density functions. Methods are presented to demonstrate how mathematical algorithms can be developed to obtain a "best fit" calibration line and how uncertainty ranges in interpretations of unknowns can be obtained from the calibration. The data used to demonstrate these methods were obtained from Brookhaven National Laboratory fission track analysis data for plutonium in urine. Examination of the variability in the fission track analysis data, during the period of time that the demonstration data were collected, revealed that the deviations from the mean were neither normal nor lognormal, but the ratios of tracks divided by the median at each plutonium level were lognormally distributed. Consequently, the differences between the logarithms of observed tracks and the median were normally distributed. The new "best fit" line was obtained by minimizing a reduced chi-square statistic made up of the squared differences in logarithms, divided by the variance in logarithms and degrees of freedom. Thus, to detect a worker urine sample to be above the 58-person "control" population 95 percentile [about 3.2 muBq (85 aCi)] at the 95% probability level (0.05 Type H error) would now require an average of about 11 muBq (300 aCi) per sample, compared to 5 muBq per sample (132 aCi per sample) in a previous paper. This paper presents the algorithms used to obtain the new calibration line and the uncertainty distributions of interpretations at various analyte levels. The importance of maintaining process control over the statistical interpretation of bioassay data as well as for the radiochemical procedures for achieving the lowest feasible level of detection is demonstrated.

J	Kramer, GH; Allen, SA; Groff, D				Kramer, GH; Allen, SA; Groff, D			Problems encountered during the calibration of the new Cameco mobile lung counter: Detector size or phantom limitation?	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						lungs, human; phantom; calibration; counting efficiency	GE DETECTORS; URANIUM; LLNL	This paper describes the calibration of the new Cameco mobile lung counter and, more importantly, the problems encountered with recommendations for their long-term solution. The new Cameco lung counting system, which is based on an array of four 80-min-diameter Canberra BeGe detectors, has used the JAERI phantom for its primary calibration as it more closely resembles ICRP reference data for lung dimensions compared with the LLNL phantom. Although the JAERI phantom's lung dimensions offer advantages over the LLNL phantom's lungs, this phantom is still not ideal. The work described in this paper leads to the conclusion that the LLNL be modified to more closely resemble the ICRP reference data if large area germanium detectors comprise the lung counter. Overlay plate stacking was necessary to achieve the range of chest wall thicknesses found within the Canteen work force (2-8 cm) when using the JAERI phantom. This technique has proved to be robust and is useful for extending the calibration range. Cameco is using group monitoring, which adds spectra to simulate very long counting is times (10-20 h), and it is essential that all materials be low background. This was not initially the case here as found from overnight background counts.

Refractory alloys offer a significant advantage of high neutron wall load capability under fusion neutron environment. In this study, main radiation damage parameters (displacement per atom (DPA) and helium production) on three different refractory alloys, namely W-5Re, TZM (Mo alloy) and Nb-1Zr used as structural material in a hybrid reactor were found. Neutron transport calculations were conducted with the aid of SCALE4.3 System by solving the Boltzmann transport equation with code XSDRNPM. The lowest radiation damage values were obtained for W-5Re alloy. Moreover, all investigated materials will require to be replaced frequently due to their radiation damage values during reactor life (similar to 30 years).

The effective absorption coefficient and ablation threshold of the TFTR co-deposited layers for KrF laser were 0.4 mum(-1) and 4.2 J/cm(2), which were a bit larger than those of the JT-60 co-deposited layers (0.3 mum(-1) and 2.3 J/cm(2)) for the same laser. In addition, hydrogen (tritium) was found to be released in the form of hydrogen molecules, and the combination of excimer laser and mass spectrometer or tritium monitor could be a promising technique for analyzing the depth profiles in the co-deposited layers and the substrate near the interface. Furthermore, the formation of cones on the JT-60 co-deposited layers due to local surface melting was observed at the fluence of 0.8 J/cm(2) for KrF laser irradiation, whereas strong melting was determined to be the mechanism of the ablative removal of the JT-60 co-deposited layers at fluences greater than the ablation threshold of 2.3 J/cm(2).

Ion exchange of cesium on ferrocyanides	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							NICKEL HEXACYANOFERRATE(II); INSOLUBLE FERROCYANIDES; ABSORPTION; PHOSPHATES; STABILITY; 137CS	Some heavy metal ferrocyanides were prepared and their selectivity towards cesium was investigated. Many were found to have good ion exchange properties and some can be easily prepared in a granular form suitable for the use in a packed column operation. The ferrocyanides; show high cesium uptake in various simulated processing solutions relevant to the treatment of radioactive wastes. The amount of cesium sorbed by these hexacyanoferrates exceeded 99%. They also possess a high selectivity for cesium in solutions of high salt concentration. Desorption of the sorbed cesium at various nitric acid concentrations have been investigated and it is concluded that cesium is eluted by a chemical reaction step as a consequence of the oxidation of the ferrocyanides. It has also been observed that ferrocyanides degrade in solutions of low pH.

Improvement in sensitivity of all the aforementioned radioisotopes was found by optimization of the collision cell parameters. It was demonstrated that the measurements of radiocesium and radiostrontium require different collision cell parameters if they are measured in the presence or absence of Ba and Zr. The detection limits were improved by a factor of 100, 33, 22, 500, and 50 for Sr-90, Cs-135, Cs-137, Pb-210, and Ra-226, respectively.

Gamma-spectrometry showed that the uptake values of strains A-C, T-A, A-E and CH-G at a radioactivity level of 4.3 +/- 0.2 Bq.ml(-1) were 202 +/- 53, 171 +/- 49, 123 +/- 11 and 53 +/- 6 Bq.g(-1), respectively. Biosorption was the major mechanism involved in (226)Ra uptake and was not affected by 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) or incubation at 4degreesC. There was an inverse relationship between the rapid radium uptake value and biomass weight in the strains A-C and A-E. Strain A-C was identified as Citrobacter freundii and strains T-A, A-E and CH-G belonged to the genera Corynebacterium, Chromobacterium and Chromobacterium, respectively.

J	Chang, Z; Nomura, M; Fujii, Y				Chang, Z; Nomura, M; Fujii, Y			Isotope effect of potassium in an aqueous/amalgam system	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							CATION-EXCHANGE CHROMATOGRAPHY; FRACTIONATION; AMALGAM; LITHIUM; EQUILIBRIA; HYDROXIDE; MAGNESIUM; CHEMISTRY; RUBIDIUM	The isotope fractionation of potassium in an aqueous (KOH)/amalgam system has been studied. Two types of isotope effects with opposite isotope enrichment directions were observed in the electrolysis of potassium from the aqueous into the amalgam phase under constant electrolytic potentials. It was found that the first isotope effect causing the light isotope enriched in the amalgam is related to the kinetic process of the mass transfer through the aqueous/amalgam interface, while the second one leading to the enrichment of the heavy isotope in the amalgam phase is produced by the isotope-exchange equilibrium. The temperature dependence of the equilibrium isotope effect was also investigated using single-stage and multi-stage techniques. It was observed that the equilibrium isotope effect increases as the temperature increases in the range of 293-371 K. An empirical equation was used to fit the variations of the isotope effects with temperature for potassium together with the other alkaline and alkaline earth metals studied in the same system. The origin of the equilibrium isotope fractionation in the electron-exchange system was discussed. Furthermore, the mass dependence of the separation coefficients of the alkaline and alkaline earth metals observed in aqueous/amalgam and ion-exchange systems were compared.

Validation of the methodology was done using the Soil 7 (IAEA) reference material. The REE contents vary according to core location and lithological units, depending on the proportion of fluvial terrigenous components in the lake sediments. Lithologies with higher proportion of terrigenous components show higher REE concentrations, suggesting that the dominant REE carrier phase might be a detrital mineral. There is a consistent value of about 1.2 for (La/Yb)(N) and (LREE/HFEE)(N) ratios for all sediments at the three sites, indicating a slight LREE enrichment in relation to the average shale NASC. Ce/Ce* values are close to 1.0, meaning that Ce behaves similarly to other light REE's.

Column experiments were performed on different exchangers in various conditions and the effect of parameters such as particle size, pH, temperature, and time were considered. The distribution coefficient, cation exchange capacity and some thermodynamic parameters were calculated. Ion-exchange isotherms and break-through curves were plotted. As a result, the selectivity of synthetic zeolite P from Iranian natural clinoptilolite toward cerium and thorium was compared with that of natural and cationic forms of clinoptilolite.

The potential of these extractants was found to be in the order TAP>THP>TBP by calculating the acid uptake value (K-H). The effect of various parameters such as solvent degradation due to acid hydrolysis, radiation effect, decontamination factor and phase separation were investigated and it was found that TAP was always a better extractant in comparison to THP and TBP. In addition to this, the extraction of fission product contaminants such as Ce-144, Cs-137, Ru-106, Zr-95 was almost negligible, even at very high nitric acid concentrations in the aqueous phase, indicating the potential application of TAP in actinide partitioning. Sodium carbonate solution or acidified distilled water was a good strippant for U(VI), similarly, uranium(IV) nitrate stripped Pu(IV) from the organic phase.

Total Pb-210, Ra-226. associated with supported Pb-210, and Cs-137 specific activity profiles were measured by gamma-ray spectrometry. Unsupported Pb-210 fluxes showed very low values when compared to other regions, with a 12 fold variation, ranging from 4 to 48 Bq m(-2) . y(-1). The linear correlation observed between the Pb-210 fluxes and Cs-137 cumulative fluxes in sediment cores sampled from water bodies within a zone with similar precipitation demonstrated that both radioisotopes behave in the same manner in these systems concerning the processes occurred from fallout to sediment deposition, and that there are no appreciable local or regional sources of unsupported Pb-210. Positive correlation of Pb-210 fluxes with organic matter contents of the uppermost sediment core layers was also observed.

The effects of the different parameters affecting the extraction process were studied and the stoichiometry of the extracted species was elucidated. The kinetics of this extraction was also investigated using a stirred Lewis cell. The effects of the different parameters affecting the extraction rate as well as the temperature were separately investigated. The results are interpreted by a reaction mechanism where the extraction process of U(IV) is controlled by a chemical reaction at the interface rather than in the bulk phase.

The investigated site was an alpine pasture located in the Charpathian Mountains, in an area found as one of the most affected in Romania after the Chernobyl accident. In the examined soil sections radioactive inventories were estimated to be 500 Bq/m(2) for Pu-241, 115 Bq/m(2) for Pu239+240, 8 Bq/m(2) for Pu-238 and 50 Bq/m(2) for Am-241. On the basis of activity ratios in the soil profile, the source of the radioactive release is discussed.

The data showed that 50 minutes is a sufficient time to attain equilibrium with a maximum extraction percentage for uranium ion on polyurethane foams loaded with crown ether. Also the extraction percentage of uranium is increased markedly with increasing the pH values up to pH similar to 6 and displayed the lowest extraction at 8>pH>6. The different isotherms of uranium sorption have shown that the sorption followed a Freundlich isotherm. Column studies have been carried out in order to extend these studies to the plant scale. From the data of column sorption and breakthrough curves, the height equivalent of theoretical plates (HETP), and breakthrough capacity which affect the efficiency of the column have been calculated and found to be 1.03 mm/plate, 64 +/- 5 and 58.3 mg uranium/gram polyurethane foam impregnated with crown ether, respectively.

J	Mora, P				Mora, P			Outdoor and indoor dose assessment using environmental thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLDs) in Costa Rica	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article								Costa Rica lies at the intersection of the Cocos and Caribbean plates in Central America. It has mountain ranges with many active volcanoes along its territory. Its soils are predominantly of volcanic origin. Natural radiation measurements utilising environmental CaF2:Dy thermoluminescence dosimeters were used for the first time in Costa Rica by the Dosimetry Section of the Atomic, Nuclear and Molecular Sciences Research Center of the University of Costa Rica. Seven hundred outdoor measurements were obtained in a 3.5-year period at eight different sites throughout the country. One hundred and seventy-four indoor readings were also collected at four sites for a 2-year period. Population-weighted averages give 82 nGy h(-1) for outdoors and 130 nGy h(-1) for indoors. The values lie on the upper range of worldwide reported values due to reported soil characteristics rich in uranium and potassium. A preliminary population-weighted value of 0.74 mSv/year for the effective dose is calculated for natural terrestrial gamma radiation in Costa Rica.

J	Greenwood, SJ				Greenwood, SJ			Defining best practice in waste minimisation	NUCLEAR ENERGY-JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH NUCLEAR ENERGY SOCIETY			English	Article						codes of practice & standards; waste management & disposal		The Radioactive Substances Act 1993 requires operators to be authorised to dispose of radioactive wastes from their sites. Furthermore, the Act places a statutory duty on operators to demonstrate that they are applying the Best Practicable Means (BPM) to prevent, and where this is not practicable, minimise waste arisings and discharges. The proposed UKAEA Harwell Authorisation and recently issued AWE Authorisation have placed a series of Improvement Requirements on the operator with respect to several aspects of waste management. One of these requires the operators to review best practice in waste minimisation. RM Consultants, under contract to UKAEA Harwell and AWE, have developed a methodology that provides a basis for responding to this requirement. This paper explains the sets of Best Practice Principles which were defined and points out that they may have wider application to other nuclear radioactive waste producers, in developing a common achievement of best practice across the industry.
