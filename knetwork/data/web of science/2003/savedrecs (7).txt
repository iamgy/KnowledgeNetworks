In the present study, the radon levels at Madurai district of Tamilnadu have been measured initially for 15 dwellings using cellulose nitrate (C6H8O9N2) LR-115 type II (non-pelliculable) films and the dose assessment due to radon and its daughter product concentrations is calculated. These results were intercompared with other terrains viz. Jodhpur district of Rajasthan which is considered as semi-desert terrain and Jammu district of Jammu & Kashmir which is the hilly area. Also the natural radioactivity in soil samples of Madurai have been measured using Nal(Tl) detector based gamma spectrometry. From these radioactivity levels, the radium equivalent activity is calculated and a correlation between this and radon concentration has been tried out. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The hydrodynamic factor, presence of radium in host rocks, as well as the soil porosity and permeability control its concentration in groundwater. In order to understand the factors that control the occurrence of radon in groundwater of Doon valley in Outer Himalaya, a total of 34 groundwater samples were collected from handpumps and tubewells covering three hydrogeological units/areas in the eastern part of Doon valley. Radon variation in tubewells and handpumps varies from 25.4 +/- 1.8 to 92.5 +/- 3.4 Bq/l with an average of 53.5 +/- 2.6 Bq/l. A significant positive correlation between radon concentration and depth of the wells was observed in the Doiwala-Dudhli and Jolleygrant areas suggesting that radon concentration increases with drilling depth in areas consisting of sediments of younger Doon gravels, whereas samples of the Ganga catchment show negative correlation. The high radon levels at shallower depths in the Ganga catchment (consisting of fluvial terraces of Ganga basin) indicate uranium-rich sediments at shallower depth. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Six irradiations were carried out in different nuclear reactors: Pavia (Italy), IPEN-CNEN (Brazil) and IPEN-Lima (Peru). Measurements of the thorium and uranium induced-fission per target nucleus using natural thorium thin films and natural U-doped glasses calibrated against natural uranium thin films, together with lambda(F) of 8.46 x 10(-17) a(-1) were used to determine the ages. The apparent ages were corrected using the plateau and size correction methods. Track measurements were performed by different analysts, using different counting criteria. In addition, tracks were measured on samples which had been submitted to thermal treatment as well as on samples which had not been heated. Thermal treatments were carried out to erase the fossil tracks before neutron irradiation. No significant differences have been found in individual results, using the two Macusanite pebbles and the different nuclear reactors, age correction techniques, analysts, track-counting criteria, and thermal treatments before neutron irradiation. The great majority of the results (14/17) is compatible with the Ar-Ar ages of 5.12 +/- 0.11 and 5.10 +/- 0.11 Ma, Macusanite MB1 and MB2, respectively. However, the fission-track ages are systematically less (similar to8%) than the Ar-Ar ages of the two Macusanite samples studied. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The concentrations show maxima in the early morning hours when the turbulence mixing is minimum; whereas in the afternoon the turbulence mixing is maximum and concentrations exhibit minima. The median values of concentration are 9.70 and 2.84 Bq m(-3), respectively, for radon and its progeny, during the observation period. Ionization rates in the atmosphere are derived for the same period. It is found that the ionization rate exhibits a median value of 5.48 ion pairs cm(-3) s(-1). The diurnal and seasonal variations in the concentrations of radon and its progeny, and the ionization rate due to radioactivity are found to exhibit correlation with the relative humidity, and anti-correlation with the temperature.

The envisaged extraction process involves dispersion of radioactive particulate matter into atmosphere. Environmental radioactive studies in and around proposed mining areas at this point of time will be extremely useful for establishing base line data before a large scale uranium extraction process comes into existence. To this end, Solid State Nuclear Track Detectors were installed to evaluate indoor radon and thoron concentration levels in the dwellings of the area. The geometric means of radon and thoron concentration levels were found to be (7.1 +/- 0.2) x 10(1) and (6.7 +/- 0.3) x 10(1) Bq/m(3), respectively. Simultaneously, natural background radiation measurements were also made and these levels are found to vary from 770 to 3995 muGy/y in the spatial distribution. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The measured activity in the selected building materials ranges from (3.2 to 151.7 Bq/kg), 14 to 63.7 Bq/kg and 24.3 to 121.5 Bq/kg for Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 respectively. The activity concentration of U-238 has been determined using fission track technique and the value ranges from 0.11 to 3.85 ppm. The concentrations for these natural radionuclides are compared with the reported data from other countries. Radium-equivalent activities (Ra-cq) are calculated for the measured samples to assess the radiation hazards arising due to the use of these materials in the construction of dwellings. All building materials have shown Racq activities lower than the limit set in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) report (370 Bq/kg), equivalent to external gamma dose of 1.5 mSv yr(-1). A good correlation has been observed between U-238 and Ra-226 in these materials. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

About 100 dwellings were chosen at random covering most parts of Khammam district. Twin chamber cup dosimeters consisting of solid-state nuclear track detectors (SSNTDs, LR-115, Type-II) were used to evaluate the radiation levels at quarterly intervals for a period of one calendar year. The average radon and thoron concentrations were found to be 39.1 +/- 13.3 and 19.4 +/- 14.9 Bq/m(3), respectively. Seasonal variations of radon/thoron levels were also studied. Variations of radon/thoron concentration levels with different types of dwellings have been studied. In the bare flooring dwellings thoron levels were found to be highest in comparison to concrete, limestone and marble floorings. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The concentration levels of radon and its progeny varied from 3 to 47 Bq/m(3) and 0.04 to 3.5 mWL with arithmetic mean of 11 Bq/m(3) and 0.9 mWL, respectively. These airborne radioactivity levels in the surrounding areas of Hyderabad are found to be less than the activity levels of urban Hyderabad region. Seasonal variations of these activity levels have also been studied. Further, variation of radon and its progeny levels in different types of dwellings were investigated and it is found that the dwellings with bare flooring and mud walls were found to have higher concentration levels. Distribution of dwellings for different radon levels was carried out to unravel the effect of poor ventilation, type of the construction materials used, etc. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The sources of these samples comprise of drains ponds, springs, dug wells, handpumps, municipal committee supply and tube wells. Initially, the fission track technique was used for the estimation U-content. As some of the samples showed high values of U-content, all these samples along with some new samples were also analysed using the laser fluorometry technique in order to confirm the results. A comparative analysis of the results obtained from these two different techniques has been made. The comparison confirmed high U-content in some of the samples. It is observed that the laser fluorometry technique is more suitable for analysis of the water samples having high U-content than the fission track technique. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Burning of coal is one of the sources of the technologically enhanced exposure of human beings from natural radionuclides. The population is exposed to radiation which are discharged to the environment by the emissions from thermal power stations in gaseous and particulate form containing radioisotopes. This paper presents the measurements of airborne radon levels in the coal fired thermal power plants at Kasimpur (Uttar Pradesh), Labra Mohabat at Bhatinda (Punjab) and at Durgapur (West Bengal) in India. Radon levels in the plants are found to be higher than in the Indian dwellings. Potential alpha activity, radon and its daughter concentration, and effective dose equivalent are obtained.

Meas. 25(1-4) (1995) 413; Radionuclides and Heavy metals in Environment, Vol. 5, 2001, Kluwer Academic Publisher, Dordrecht) indicate that the surface ( less than or equal to 5 cm) layer of the soil in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) accident region consists of thinly dispersed radionuclides and highly-radioactive "hot" particles (HPs). The latter contain nearly 2/3rds of the total alpha-activity of the contaminated soil. In the present report, the new results of continued HP alpha-activity characteristics are presented. The chief attempt made was to investigate size-frequency vs. alpha-activity distribution of HPs of size fraction less than or equal to 10-100 mum. For the Hp-aggregates with similar to100-1000 mum sizes, alpha-radio-nuclide heterogeneity was established. This is probably the result of formation of HP-aggregates during the second stage of the NPP accident process: in these HPs the presence of not only U and fission products of "fuel" origin has been revealed, but also of terrestrial matter components.

In the present study indoor radon monitoring has been carried out in fly ash brick dwellings in some villages/towns of district Faridabad, Haryana (India) using alpha sensitive LR-115 type II solid-state nuclear track detectors. The radon concentration levels in fly ash brick dwellings varied from 197 to 448 Bq m(-3) with an average of 277 +/- 13 Bq m(-3) while annual effective dose received by the occupants varied from 3.4 to 7.7 mSv with an average of 4.8 +/- 0.2 mSv. These results have been compared with the radon levels found in cemented and mud dwellings taken from our studies for these dwellings. These studies were also made simultaneously along with fly ash dwellings using same technique and in the same regions. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The first method consists in the double irradiation of diverse powdered solid, packed in Mylar envelops used as fission fragment track detectors, with 23 MeV gamma rays and then after remounting, with thermal neutron at the JINR microtron MT-25. The second method consists in the double irradiation of the same specimens mounted as layers, also in contact with Mylar, with high fluence (up to 10(19) cm(-2)) of 23 and 15 MeV gamma rays. In both cases well-calibrated U-nat etalon layers were used to check gamma ray and thermal neutron fluence.

Actually, as it has been established recently, Pu is accumulated during the whole life and the dangerous concentrations are estimated to be 10(-12)-10(-13) g of Pu/g of human tissues. We warn that now the average concentration of Pu in human body is not less that 10(-14) g/g and much higher for some "hot" regions in Europe and Asia. Here we present the data on Pu-239 and al Am-241 in human hair (Semipalatinsk region area) and in human gall stones of some samples from more "quiet" regions-Minsk (Belarus) and Krakow (Poland). At the measurements of Pu-239 concentration in human hair and gall stones it has been found that it varies from 10(-13) up to 3 x 10(-12) g/g for south part of heavily damaged Semipalatinsk nuclear bomb test site region. Further possible improvement of neutron-gamma activation analysis-up to the level of 10(-15) g/g of Pu in human tissues, based on application of ultra. clean chemicals and track detectors and on selective extraction of U out of electroplated Pu layers in flow of chlorides at high temperatures are discussed. Such upgrading the method can allow one to use the specimens of human tissues as small, as 0.1-0.2 g in the routine Pu analysis. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Wide spread uranium mineralization is associated with copper, nickel and other sulphides in the Singhbhum shear zone developed at the northern margin of the Singhbhum craton in the state of Jharkhand of India. Emanation of radon an alpha-active inert gas is associated with the presence of uranium in ground whose concentration varies with specific sites and geological materials. Measurements of radon exhalation rate in rock samples from Surda copper mine area have been carried out. Can technique using LR-115 type II plastic track detector has been used for measurements. Uranium, thorium and potassium concentrations have been measured through low level gamma ray spectroscopy. Uranium concentration (activity) is found to vary from 135.8 to 4607.8 Bq/kg whereas the exhalation rate lies in the range 0.26 to 1.15 Bq m(-2) h(-1). Overall a positive correlation has been found between uranium concentration and radon exhalation rates. Results are compared with our earlier measurements in other mines regions of the Singhbhum shear zone. This area has the lowest uranium concentration and radon exhalation rate.

In our method, neither direct contact of CR-39 track detectors to the samples nor thermal neutron activation process is required. The concentration of (222)Rn in the emanation container (Genitron Instruments GmbH) is dependent on the uranium deposited in the phosphate sample. The CR-39 and a pulse ionization chamber, Alpha GUARD PQ-2000 (Genitron Instruments GmbH) were simultaneously used for radon detection. The detection efficiency of CR-39 was calibrated with the Alpha GUARD. The uranium content determinations were performed using a high-resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer for comparison. The measurements revealed a very high uranium content, 355 ppm for ore and 118 ppm for fertilizer from El-Sobaeya mine, while it was 7 ppm for fertilizer from El-Suez.

The composition, morphology and structure of the mineral phases which include U and P, were studied by an electron microprobe, combined with scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Layers and concretions of uranium-bearing phospborite (U and P concentration of about 50 ppm and 19.2 wt%, respectively) were identified by autoradiography in the sediments of Lake Baikal. These layers may be considered as good paleomarkers for sediment chronology in Lake Baikal. The phosphorites consist of a metastable phase of calcium-deficient phosphate which has not been observed before in sediments and rocks. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Pore diameters and shape were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and a replica technique where the pores were electrochemically filled with metal. The results show that it is possible to form straight cylindrical pores with diameters in the range of 100 nm. The flow rate of air through the microfilters was determined. It turned out to be a linear function of the pore diameter at this pore size. With increasing pressure, the flow rate increases. At a certain level, the increase becomes non-linear, almost exponential. It can be assumed that this is due to stress-induced deformation of the polymer with an increase in the pore diameter. With the model system carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide the microfilters were tested for their ability for gas separation. Gas chromatographic measurements show that carbon monoxide penetrates faster through the microfilter, rendering gas separation possible. Possible applications of such microfilters for separating gases include radiation environment such as fusion reactors. For testing the beta-radiation stability, the microfilters were stored in tritium gas. The microfilters appeared to be radiation resistant. After the storage time, no changes in the microfilter properties were found. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This in-vessel shield is provided to reduce the neutron flux at the intermediate heat exchanger so that secondary sodium activation in the heat exchanger can be kept to an acceptable level. It is necessary to optimise this in-vessel shield because an over design will increase the cost of the reactor and under design will increase secondary sodium activation. Mock up experiments to study neutron transport through various combinations of shield models consisting of layers of steel, sodium, borated graphite and boron carbide were carried out. In these shield model combinations, along with activation detectors, SSNT detectors were also kept to measure the reaction rate by the (n,f) technique. For this purpose, Lexan(R) polycarbonate track detector were used in combination with various fissionable nuclides such as natural uranium, thorium, neptunium, depleted uranium, etc., either in deposition form or foil form. The fission reaction rates per atom in various neutron energy regions were evaluated by counting the induced fission track density. These reaction rates are being interpreted using an appropriate computer code for unfolding the neutron spectrum. The paper describes the results obtained from the fission track data in the various sets of the experiments. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This formula was then used to evaluate the ionization total cross sections for WF6 and for structured isomers of C3H4 and C4H6, at intermediate electron-impact energies. For WF6 the estimated ionization cross section is compared with available experimental and theoretical data. In addition, for C3H4 and C4H6 ionization total cross sections were calculated with the binary-encounter Bethe (BEB) model to compare with the values predicted from the regression formula. Grand total cross section for electron scattering from UF6 molecules was also estimated over energy range from 20 to 400 eV. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

An example concerns the mapping of the distributions of radioactively labeled molecules in laboratory animals which is of crucial importance for life sciences. Tomographic methods like Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) offer a possibility to visualize distributions of radioactively labeled molecules in living animals. Miniature tomography systems, derived from their clinical counterparts, but with a much higher image resolution are under development in several institutes. An example is U-SPECT that will be discussed in the present paper. Such systems are expected to accelerate several biomedical research procedures, the understanding of gene and protein function, as well as pharmaceutical development. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

To this end, we implemented an experimental technique to convert para- to ortho-deuterium molecules by flowing D-2 gas through a cryogenic cell filled with paramagnetic hydrous ferric oxide granules. This process efficiently reduced the para-D-2 concentration from 33.3% to 1.5%. Rotational Raman spectroscopy was applied to measure the residual para-D-2 contamination to better than 2 parts in 10(3), and the hydrogen contamination to 1 part in 10(3). We also contrast our optical technique to conventional thermal conductivity measurements of the para-D-2 concentration. reporting some of the relevant strengths and weaknesses of our implementation of each technique.

The precise quantitative knowledge of this ratio is crucial because the nucleons in atoms and molecules contribute differently to the average nuclear polarization of the target gas. A new calibration technique used to derive the relative sensitivity to atoms and molecules is presented. As an example, it is shown how the gas analyzer is used within the HERMES environment to divide the molecules in the gas sample into an unpolarized and a potentially polarized fraction.

The software system consists of three modules: (i) for reconstruction transmission tomography, (ii) for reconstruction emission tomography, and (iii) for simulation tomography. The Simulation Module is an interactive computer program that is used to create simulated databases for input to the Reconstruction Modules. These databases may be used in the absence of physical measurements to insure that the tomographic theoretical models are valid and that the coding accurately describes these models. Simulation may also be used to determine the detection limits of the reconstruction methodology. A description of the system, the theory, and a demonstration of the systems capabilities is provided in the paper. The hardware for this system is currently under development. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

From an air sample of about 7 m(3) collected during 12 h, 0.5 cm(3) of xenon is extracted, and the atmospheric activities from the four xenon isotopes (133) Xe, (135)xe, Xe-131m, and Xe-133m are determined with a beta-gamma coincidence technique. The collection is performed using activated charcoal and molecular sieves at ambient temperature. The sample preparation and quantification are performed using preparative gas chromatography. The system was tested under routine conditions for a 5-month period, with average minimum detectable concentrations below 1 mBq/m(3) for all four isotopes. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Francois, JL; Martin-del-Campo, C; Francois, R; Morales, LB				Francois, JL; Martin-del-Campo, C; Francois, R; Morales, LB			A practical optimization procedure for radial BWR fuel lattice design using tabu search with a multiobjective function	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								An optimization procedure based on the tabu search (TS) method was developed for the design of radial enrichment and gadolinia distributions for boiling water reactor (BWR) fuel lattices. The procedure was coded in a computing system in which the optimization code uses the tabu search method to select potential solutions and the HELIOS code to evaluate them. The goal of the procedure is to search for an optimal fuel utilization, looking for a lattice with minimum average enrichment, with minimum deviation of reactivity targets and with a local power peaking factor (PPF) lower than a limit value. Time-dependent-depletion (TDD) effects were considered in the optimization process. The additive utility function method was used to convert the multiobjective optimization problem into a single objective problem. A strategy to reduce the computing time employed by the optimization was developed and is explained in this paper. An example is presented for a 10 x 10 fuel lattice with 10 different fuel compositions. The main contribution of this study is the development of a practical TDD optimization procedure for BWR fuel lattice design, using TS with a multiobjective function, and a strategy to economize computing time.

J	Song, MC; Lee, KJ				Song, MC; Lee, KJ			The evaluation of radioactive corrosion product at PWR as change of primary coolant chemistry for long-term fuel cycle	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								These days, nuclear power plant operation practice shifts to long-term fuel cycle such as from 12 month operating cycle to 18-24 month operating one. It is important to emphasize that the current trend to longer fuel cycle has complicated the dilemma of finding optimum pH range for the primary coolant chemistry. Although CRUD is not a high level waste, it is very important products because CRUD is the major source of ORE and its transport mechanism is not specified exactly yet. To analyze the generation mechanism of CRUD at the long-term fuel cycle, the COTRAN code used, which simulate the behavior of the CRUD based on double layer concept model and solubility difference. It turned out that the activities of CRUD decreases as the pH of the coolant increases, and for the same period of different fuel cycle, the generation of the CRUD increases as the operating fuel cycle duration increased. In this paper, enriched boric acid (40% enriched B(10)concentration) for the reactivity control is adopted for the simulation as the required chemical shim rather than natural boric acid.

J	Keegan, RP; Gehrke, RJ				Keegan, RP; Gehrke, RJ			A method to determine the time since last purification of weapons grade plutonium	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						decay series; Pu-241; age determination; Bateman equations; weapons grade plutonium; non-destructive		A non-destructive technique to determine the time since last purification of weapons grade plutonium based on the Pu-241 decay series has been developed and demonstrated to provide results that are consistent with our historical and process knowledge. This method is based or, the use of the Bateman equations and the decay chain Pu-241-->U-237 & Am-241-->Np-237-->Pa-233. Secular equilibrium is assumed between the (2.1 X 10(6) year) Np-237 and the (27 day) Pa-233. The proposed method is dependent upon the efficiency of the plutonium separation process but makes no assumption about the relative abundance of Pu-241 in Pu-239. Even though the technique was developed for weapons grade plutonium, it is expected to apply to almost any material that contains plutonium. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To examine the radiation balance, all wastes, which have accumulated by the time mentioned from reprocessing of spent fuel from thermal and fast reactors are included, taking account of the running nuclide composition. The change in the potential biological danger is calculated as a function of the holding time of the entire mass of the wastes taking account of the short-lived nuclide daughter products. The possibility of starting coextraction of thorium and radium with,uranium starting in 2010 and 2030 or without coextraction is taken into account. If coextraction is implemented during the periods indicated, then radiation balance of the radiactive wastes which accumulate by 2100 or 2200 is reached within a holding period of 80-120 yr Without coextraction, the fraction of plutonium going into the wastes will have to be decreased from 0. 1 to 0.01%.

This laboratory also included radiochemical and radiometric laboratories for analyzing irradiated samples. In 1998, a decision was made to decommission the laboratory and the reactor. The structures in the integrated laboratory were decommissioned according to plan. First, the spent nuclear fuel was removed for reprocessing. Next, the in-reactor equipment was disassembled and, being most highly radioactive, moved for storage to the plant Moscow Scientific-Industrial Association Radon. The low-activity equipment from the radiochemical laboratories was stored in the existing buildings located below the zero marker and rebuilt following the design into a stationary storage site for radioactive wastes. A network of observational wells was constructed to monitor the storage site and radiation monitoring of environmental objects was provided. It is shown in this paper that the stationary wastes-storage structure does not present any problems for the environment, since for 300 yr the construction of the storage facility will prevent radionuclides from escaping the site in amounts exceeding admissable values. After this period, the radioactivity of the wastes will decrease and will fall below the minimum significant value.

The diffusion flux of carbon directed toward the surface arises as a result of the formation of uranium oxymonocarbide, which contains carbon impurity, on the surface in the presence of low oxygen partial pressure.

Supplying fuel includes supplying fuel for Russian nuclear power plants, propulsion and research reactors, export of fuel for nuclear power plants and research reactors constructed according to Russian designs, export of low-enriched uranium and fuel for nuclear power plants constructed according to foreign designs. The explored deposits of natural uranium, the estimated stores of uranium in reserve deposits, and warehoused stores will provide nuclear power with uranium up to 2030 and in more distant future with the planned rates of development. The transition of nuclear power plants to a new fuel run will save up to 20% of the natural uranium. The volume of reprocessing of spent fuel and reuse of U-235 makes it possible to satisfy up to 30% of the demand for resources required for Russian nuclear power plants. The most efficient measure of the resource safety of Russian nuclear power is implementation of an interconnected strategy at each stage of the nuclear fuel cycle.

The potentiometric method of the emf of a solid-electrolyte galvanic cell in the range 850-1050degreesC and solid-phase coulometric titration with working temperature 1000degreesC were used to study the dependence of the,oxygen potential of uranium-cerium oxide on the oxygen/metal ratio and the temperature. The concentration dependences of the enthalpy and the entropy of dissolution of oxygen in uranium-cerium oxide are calculated and constructed and it is determined that these dependences vary strongly at near-stoichiometric composition. The results can be used to analyze the properties of uranium-plutonium oxide fuel.

The coagulant consisted of active aluminum hydroxide with concentration 2.5 mg/liter with respect to aluminum. The coagulant and most of the radionuclide mass were removed using Termoksid-3A sorbent. Additional removal of radionuclides and electrolytes occurs on bulk layers of anionite and cationite, these layers also maintain the water regime parameters - the electric conductivity, the chloride concentration, and other indicators - within the prescribed range. The coagulant accumulated on the Termoksid-3A sorbent is removed periodically by counterflow agitation washing. This technology has been tested on a model system simulating the main components and parameters of the proposed scheme.

It is determined that during the separation of the fuel part of the fuel elements the coefficient of transfer of Cs-137 from the fuel into aerosol is 5.10(-6) and for fragmentation the value is 3.10(-5). It is found that the real catching efficiency for aerosol particles caught by a V-05 filter ranges from 42 to 99%. The specific entry of radioactive aerosols into the ventillation center after the first stage of air purification was 0.3 MBq for alpha-emitters and 7.7 MBq for beta and gamma emitters per 1 kg of reprocessed fuel. The total collective dose formed at the stages of preparation of a large batch of irradiated fuel (four spent fuel asemblies with average burnup 11.4% and a 10.5 to 23.7 yr holding period)for reprocessing was 11.5.10(-3) persons.Sv.

J	Sailer, M; Kallenbach-Herbert, B				Sailer, M; Kallenbach-Herbert, B			Long-term aspects of fuel element interim storage	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								Interim storage in casks of spent fuel elements over prolonged periods of time requires safety-related components to be available and functional throughout the entire period of operation or else to be beefed up to that condition by the appropriate backfitting measures. Even on an international scale, there is little practical experience over long periods of operation, and what is available is limited to fuel elements with comparatively low burnups. To ensure that there are no safety-related deviations from the specified status, a long-term monitoring program should be set up for all fuel element interim stores, which should include regular monitoring measures and a reporting phase every ten years covering all findings and results. As inspections of the inside of casks, of the gas atmosphere, and of the behavior of cladding tubes entail higher expenses, these inspections, supplemented by a monitoring program to determine the development of the leakage rate, should be run in an accompanying program incorporating all plants, the results of which would then be included in plant-specific evaluations. As the first German interim stores will complete their first decade of operation in a foreseeable period of time, measures should be taken there at short notice even if it is not to be expected at the present point in time that safety-related long-term effects will be discovered after the first decade of operation.

J	Rigaud, D				Rigaud, D			A proposed method to determine the decision level for radioactivity measurements	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Review						statistics; radiation, low-level; safety standards; monitoring, environmental		When measuring radioactivity, the problem rises of deciding whether or not a sample contains radioactivity in excess of background and above which value the result is meaningful. This decision process is why the notion of decision level was introduced. Whereas there is unanimity about its definition, this is not the case for its calculation, and many expressions have been proposed. This article contains a comparison of several decision level models by means of the calculation of actual false positive probability. First, three models are compared for the case of a well-known background, then a proposed model is developed and the four models are compared for the case of a poorly-known background. It appears from this study that, in order to be valid, the formula of the decision level must verify three conditions. First, the counting times have to appear symmetrically in the formula of the decision level; second, for long background counting times, the expression has to be equivalent to the one obtained with the corrected normal distribution corresponding to the Poisson law for the case of a well-known background; and, third, for large background, the expression has to be equivalent to those given by the three former models. It will be demonstrated that only the proposed model fulfills these requirements.

ICRP assumes that cesium and potassium are distributed homogeneously throughout the whole body of an organism. The current investigation measured concentrations of Cs-137 and K-40 in components of the skin, horns, and hooves of a cow. Activity levels of Cs-137 were caused by the long-term ingestion following the Chernobyl fallout, whereas the naturally occurring potassium (OK) is an essential part of cow's normal diet. The cow was born at the time of the fallout following the Chernobyl accident and had ingested heavily contaminated forage during its entire lifetime. Activities of Cs-137 and K-40 were determined simultaneously by gamma spectrometry. All activities are related to the day of slaughter and include also corrections for self attenuation of photons caused by the different densities of the samples. Radionuclide concentrations in samples were corrected for moisture losses incurred during freezing and sample preparation. Surface contamination on the skin was estimated by rinsing it in heated water followed by removal of the epidermis and hair. In comparison with the activities of the components of the skin we observed a considerable amount of external contamination on the surface of the skin. But with respect to whole body countings of the animal this amount of external contamination appears to be negligible. It was found that activity ratios of Cs-137 to K-40 are greater than 1 in all measured components. The average activity concentrations of Cs-137 and K-40 in the common integument are 23.3 Bq kg(-1) and 13.3 Bq kg(-1), respectively. The highest activity concentrations of Cs-137 and K-40 were measured in clean hair and hypodermis. Despite being its largest organ, the cow's skin contains probably less than 1% of the animal's whole body Cs-137 activity.
