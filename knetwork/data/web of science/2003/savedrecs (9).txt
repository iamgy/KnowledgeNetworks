J	Yapici, H				Yapici, H			Study of fissile fuel breeding concept for the force-free helical reactor	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						fissile fuel breeding; force-free helical reactor; curium oxide	NUCLEAR-WEAPON PROLIFERATION; FUSION EXPERIMENTAL BREEDER; DRIVEN HYBRID REACTOR; CANDU SPENT FUEL; MIXED-OXIDE FUEL; NEUTRONIC ANALYSIS; FLIBE BLANKET; MODERATED D; DESIGN; FFHR	The force-free helical reactor (FFHR) is a demo relevant helical-type D-T fusion reactor based on the large helical device (LHD). In this study, the possibilities of fissile fuel breeding (FFB) and incineration of curium oxide discharged from spent fuel of pressured water reactor (PWR) have been investigated in the FFHR. For this purpose, FFB zone containing mixed fuel has been located in the blanket of the FFHR by using two different design shapes (models 1 and 2). Four different mixtures, namely, (CmO2)-Cm-244-UC, (CmO2)-Cm-244-UO2, (CmO2)-Cm-244-UN and (CmO2)-Cm-244-U3Si2, have been used as fuel. The mixed fuels have been spherically prepared, and cladded with SiC to prevent fission products from contaminating coolant and fuel-coolant contact. The prepared fuel spheres have been replaced in the FFB zone as ten rows in radial direction, and two different coolants, helium (for models 1a and 2a) and flibe (for models 1b and 2b), have been selected for the nuclear heat transfer in the FFB zone. Calculations of neutronic data per DT fusion neutron have been performed individually for each of 16 different cases created by using four different mixed fuels in each of four different models. In the models 1 and 2, the case of helium coolant has higher M (the blanket energy multiplication ratio), which is one of main parameters in a fusion-fission hybrid reactor than the case of flibe coolant. M is quite high, and varies in the ranges of 4.747-5.895 and 2.453-2.784 in the models 1 and 2, respectively, depending on the fuel and coolant types. The fissile fuel breeding ratio (FFBRs) are also quite high in the model 1a with respect to model 1b, although coolant type does not change the FFBRs substantially in the model 2. Total FFBR (Pu-239+Cm-245 breeding ratio) varies from 0.551 to 0.650 and from 0.170 to 0.184, in the models 1 and 2, respectively, depending on the fuel and coolant types. Values of tritium breeding ratio (TBR), which is another important parameter in a fusion-fission hybrid reactor, are about 1.2 for all investigated cases so that tritium self-sufficiency is maintained for (D,T) fusion driver. Values of peak-to-average fission power density ratio, Gamma are in the range of 1.108-1.249 in all investigated cases, depending on the fuel and coolant types. Furthermore, values of neutron leakage out of the blanket for all models are quite low due to B4C shielding. Consequently, for all cases, the investigated reactor has high neutronic performance and can produce substantial electricity in situ, fissile fuel and tritium required for (D,T) fusion reaction.

J	Sahin, S; Yalcin, S; Yildiz, K				Sahin, S; Yalcin, S; Yildiz, K			Fissile fuel breeding with peaceful nuclear explosives	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						PACER concept; fissile fuel; neutron physics	HYLIFE-II; FUSION POWER	Neutron physics analysis of a dual purpose modified PACER concept has been conducted. A protective liquid droplet jet zone of 2 m thickness is considered as coolant, energy carrier, and fusile and fissile breeder. Flibe as the main constituent is mixed with increased mole-fractions of heavy metal salt (ThF4 and UF4) starting by 2 up to 12 mol.%. The neutronic model assumed a 30 m radius underground spherical geometry cavity with a 1 cm thick SS-304 stainless steel liner attached to the excavated rock wall. By a self-sufficient tritium breeding of 1.05 with 5 mol.% ThF4, or 9 mol.% UF4 an excess nuclear fuel breeding rate of 1900 kg/year of U-233 or 3000 kg/year Pu-239 of extremely high isotopic purity can be realized. This precious fuel can be considered for special applications, such as spacecraft reactors or other compact reactors. The heavy metal constituents in jet zone acts as an energy amplifier, leading to an energy multiplication of M = 1.27 or 1.65 for 5 mol.% ThF4, or 9 mol.% UF4, respectively. As an immediate result of the strong neutron attenuation in the jet zone, radiation damage with dpa < 1.4 and He < 7 ppm after a plant operation period of 30 years will be well below the damage limit values. The site could essentially be abandoned, or the cavity could be used as a shallow burial site for other qualified materials upon decommissioning. Finally, the totality of the site with all nuclear peripheral sections must be internationally safeguarded carefully, (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Sviatoslavsky, IN; Sawan, ME; Majumdar, S				Sviatoslavsky, IN; Sawan, ME; Majumdar, S			Spiral blanket: An innovative idea for a solid wall blanket with potential for high neutron wall loading	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th Topical Meeting on the Technology of Fusion Energy	NOV 17-21, 2002	WASHINGTON, D.C.				BERYLLIUM	The Advanced Power Extraction (APEX) program(1) is exploring concepts for blanket designs that can enhance the potential of fusion while using both liquid and solid walls. In that context, an innovative blanket design of dry solid wall configuration, with potential for high neutron wall loading has been proposed. The blanket utilizes nano-composited ferritic (NCF) steel structure (designated 12 YWT), which has a maximum operating temperature of 8000degrees C.(2) The cooling/breeding material is Flibe (Li2BeF4), a low viscosity version of this molten salt, which has a melting temperature of 465degrees C and is compatible with ferritic steels up to 700degrees C.(2) The dimensions for this study have been taken from ARIES-AT.(3) The blanket module, which extends 0.3 m in the toroidal direction at mid-plane, is equipped with spiraling discs ramping from the bottom to the top. The coolant enters on the bottom at 500degrees C, then travels on the spiral discs, from the rear of the module to the front, then back to the rear, all the way to the top where it exits from the module at 590degrees C. On its way up, the coolant velocity is amplified at the first wall (FW) by centrifugal action, providing a high heat transfer coefficient for dissipating the high surface heating. The 3 mm thick FW is scalloped with semicircular projections inclined in the flow direction. This facilitates unimpeded smooth flow at the FW, while at the same time stiffening the FW against pressure, obviating the need for welded reinforcements. The discs are made of two halves assembled together with a Be pebble bed enclosed as a neutron multiplier. Preliminary neutronics analysis for the outboard blanket has shown a local tritium breeding ratio (TBR) of 1.36, and an energy multiplication (M) of 1.26 including contribution from a secondary module, using natural Li. The pressure drop of 0.56 MPa in the module produces a modified primary bending stress of 124 MPa where the allowable stress for this material at 750degrees C is 142 MPa. Without optimization, this blanket is capable of dissipating an average neutron wall loading of 6 4 MW/m(2), with a peak value of 9.6 MW/m(2) and a peak surface heating of 1.3 MW/m(2). The coolant picks up energy in the secondary blanket exiting the reactor at 600degrees C. Assuming the use of a supercritical steam power cycle, an efficiency of 48% can be expected.

Neutronics calculations were performed for blanket designs using the molten salts Flibe and Flinabe to determine the transmutation rates of constituent elements and the rates of production of other elements. At least from mass balance considerations no free fluorine will be left provided that the recombination reactions with freed Be, Li, Na, and tritium are fast enough. However, more than 95% of the tritium bred will be in the form of TF. In addition, 0 and N are produced. A REDOX reaction needs to be established to control the TF activities. The Be used for neutron multiplication can be used for the REDOX control to reduce TF to T-2. The thermodynamics for the reaction between TF and Be is an important process to be demonstrated.

Of the approximately 3 mSv annual global per caput effective dose estimated for the year 2000, 2.4 mSv is from natural background and 0.4 mSv from diagnostic medical exams. Diagnostic and therapeutic radiation was used in patients as early as 1896. Since then, continual improvements in diagnostic imaging and radiotherapy as well as the aging of our population have led to greater use of medical radiation. Temporal trends indicate that worldwide population exposure from medical radiation is increasing. In the United States, there has been a steady rise in the use of diagnostic radiologic procedures, especially x rays. Radiotherapy also has increased so that today about 40% of cancer patients receive some treatment with radiation. Epidentiologic data on medically irradiated populations are an important complement to the atomic-bomb survivors' studies. Significant improvement in cancer treatment over the last few decades has resulted in longer survival and a growing number of radiation-related second cancers. Following high-dose radiotherapy for malignant diseases, elevated risks of a variety of radiation-related second cancers have been observed. Risks have been particularly high following treatment for childhood cancer. Radiation treatment for benign disease was relatively common from the 1940's to the 1960's. While these treatments generally were effective, some resulted in enhanced cancer risks. As more was learned about radiation-associated cancer risks and new treatments became available, the use of radiotherapy for benign disease has declined. At moderate doses, such as those used to treat benign diseases, radiation-related cancers occur in or near the radiation field. Cancers of the thyroid, salivary gland, central nervous system, skin, and breast as well as leukemia have been associated with radiotherapy for tinea capitis, enlarged tonsils or thymus gland, other benign conditions of the head and neck, or benign breast diseases. Because doses from diagnostic examinations typically are low, they are difficult to study using epidentiologic methods, unless multiple examinations are performed. An excess risk of breast cancer has been reported among women with tuberculosis who had multiple chest fluoroscopies as well as among scoliosis patients who had frequent diagnostic x rays during late childhood and adolescence. Dental and medical diagnostic x rays performed many years ago, when doses were presumed to be high, also have been linked to increased cancer risks. The carcinogenic effects of diagnostic and therapeutic radionuclides are less well characterized. High risks of liver cancer and leukemia have been demonstrated following thorotrast injections, and patients treated with radium appear to have an elevated risk of bone sarcomas and possibly cancers of the breast, liver, kidney, thyroid, and bladder.

The MA nitride fuel has been chosen as a candidate because of the possible mutual solubility among the actinide mononitrides and excellent thermal properties besides supporting hard neutron spectrum. MA nitrides of NpN, (Np, Pu)N, (Np, U)N, AmN, (Am, Y)N, (Am, Zr)N and (Cm, Pu)N were prepared from the oxides by the carbothermic reduction method. The prepared MA nitrides were examined by X-ray diffraction and the contents of impurities of oxygen and carbon were measured. The fabrication conditions for MA nitrides were improved so as to reduce the impurity contents. For an irradiation test of U-free nitride fuels, pellets of (Pu, Zr)N and PuN + TiN were prepared and a He-bonded fuel pin was fabricated. The irradiation test started in May 2002 and will go on for two years in the Japan Materials Testing Reactor. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

It appears that there are significant advantages to be gained by separating the Am and Cm at the reprocessing stage, simply to concentrate the problems caused by Cm and limit its mass flow. Vibrocompaction of particles or spheres is probably the most suitable consolidation process, as it reduces the number of fabrication steps and reduces the concomitant controls and scraps occurring in pelletization routes for mixed fuel and targets. The infiltration process is the most promising method to convert aqueous Cm solutions to solid material, but sol-gel and other controlled precipitation for granulate production should not be neglected.

J	Thetford, R; Mignanelli, M				Thetford, R; Mignanelli, M			The chemistry and physics of modelling nitride fuels for transmutation	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd Seminar on European Research on Materials for Transmutation	SEP 26-27, 2002	KARLSRUHE, GERMANY				MATERIAL PROPERTY CORRELATIONS; URANIUM MONONITRIDE; THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES; THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; PLUTONIUM; TRANSPORT; NITROGEN	Against the background of increased interest in nitride fuel for transmutation of minor actinides, this paper presents the current status of UK modelling of nitride fuel pins. A new equilibrium chemistry model for nitride fuel, suitable for inclusion in fuel pin modelling codes, is described. High-temperature experiments on (U,Zr)N in a sealed capsule indicate that actinide nitrides in a nitrogen atmosphere are stable up to their melting point. The paper also recommends a set of physical and chemical properties for advanced nitride fuels, highlighting the areas where data are presently missing. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The model is based on the Debye-Einstein theory of thermal energy of ionic dielectrics, on the Klemens-Callaway's approach for the heat conductance modelling and on correlations between thermoelastic properties of solids. Some results of calculations and a comparison between the calculated and measured values of the thermal conductivity of UO2, UO2-Gd(2)O3 and also of ThO2, AmO2, Am2O3 and Cm2O3, for which a limited data-set is available in the open literature, are reported. Moreover, self-irradiation effects in AmO2, Am2O3, (Am,U)O2-x, (Am,Np,U)O2-x and Cm2O3 were analysed with the developed model. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The results of experimental irradiation experiments on yttria-stabilised zirconia, doped with erbia and thoria samples utilising accelerators, tests with yttria-stabilised zirconia doped with plutonia and erbia or urania pellets within research reactors, and a study of natural zirconia contacted to actinide rich rock are evaluated and compared. The results obtained for zirconia implantation with xenon as a representative fission product are analysed in term of swelling and inertness of the material. The reactor tests preformed in the material test Boiling Water Reactor, Halden and in the High Flux Reactor, Petten are also described, with emphasis on the IMF properties under in-pile irradiation. The natural analogue study of baddeleyite from Jacupiranga, southern Brazil, provides additional information. Baddeleyite crystals enclosed within uranpyrochlore grains and received intense irradiation, which did not affect either the structural integrity or the durability of the mineral. The results of these case studies, with accelerator, use in-pile and contacted with natural radioactive sources, provide useful information on the outstanding of the behaviour of zirconia under irradiation.

Krypton atoms are found to be insoluble in UO(2) whatever the trapping site considered. Their presence induces a swelling of the lattice when they are located in interstitial sites or in oxygen vacancy sites. Due to its smaller atomic size, the predicted helium behaviour is very different. Indeed, helium is found to be soluble in stoichiometric and hyperstoichiometric uranium dioxide in the presence of uranium vacancies or divacancies. Moreover helium atoms induce a lattice contraction except in interstitial sites for which a slight expansion is found. Some preliminary results concerning xenon are also given.

In order to guarantee the stability of such fuels at high temperatures, the use of inert matrices is foreseen. In the present study, safety parameters of 800 MWthADS cores operating on oxide and nitride fuels with high americium content are investigated for a representative range of pin and core geometries. It is shown that among the inert matrices investigated, chromium yields the lowest void worth, hafnium nitride the highest fission probability for americium and magnesia the highest burnup potential.

These fuels should allow a maximization of transmutation and incineration rates, which excludes fertile UO2 as a component or matrix. The accumulated knowledge on data, phenomena and scenarios of fast reactors with (U,Pu)O-2 oxide fuels and sodium cooling serves as background for this review. For future ADS both the reactor system itself, the fuel and the coolant are innovative compared to traditional critical fast reactors. For the fuel, these boundary conditions lead to many open questions, starting from basic thermal physical, thermal mechanical and irradiation data to the behavior under transient conditions. The choice of fuel naturally has a significant impact on whole core behavior and safety too, including the influence on related neutronics parameters, on failure propagation and disruption behavior under accident conditions. Key safety issues are discussed and a first assessment of phenomena and scenarios is given. Areas of research and technology in which further work is required to resolve important safety issues are highlighted. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

It was found that the effects of the anisotropic scattering were relatively large for the MOX fuel cell because of the large neutron current from the moderator to the fuel region and the k(inf) value by the P-0 calculation became 0.10-0.16% larger than that by the P-5 calculation. With the transport correction, the k(inf) difference from the P-5 calculation became even larger than that from the P-0 calculation and the k(inf) value by the transport correction became 0.18-0.25% larger than that by the P-5 calculation for the MOX fuel cell. The transport corrected self-scattering cross sections of the moderator region become smaller than the non-transport corrected ones and the angular flux distribution becomes more anisotropic with the transport correction. Therefore, more neutrons toward the moderator region between the fuel pellets can slow down to the lower energy region with the transport correction. As a result, the k(inf) value by the transport correction becomes larger than that by the P-0 calculation, which is opposite effect to that by the P-5 calculation.

In the process, actinides are separated from fission product, especially rare earth elements (REs), by means of an electrorefining technique or a reductive-extraction technique. In this study, electrorefining experiments were carried out in LiCl-KCl/Cd system to recover actinides from salt bath containing actinides and REs. Uranium and neptunium could be depleted from the salt bath and recovered onto a solid cathode with high collection efficiency and high selectivity. Plutonium and americium, however, were difficult to be recovered at high current efficiency because reduction of Nd3+ to Nd2+ at about -1.7 V consumed cathodic current prior to the deposition of Pu or Am. The rotation of the cathode had rather negative effect against deposition of Am and Pu in case of coexistence of much amount of Nd because Nd2+ was removed from the cathode surface quickly and the reaction of Nd3+ to Nd2+ was promoted. At higher current density, Pu and Am could be recovered onto solid cathode but current efficiency became too low. The result indicated that electrorefining technique in the pyro-partitioning was effective for U and Np but not for Pu and Am.

This paper presents the results of a study on the quantitative prediction of the area affected by relocation after nuclear accidents. In this study, the relationship between the areas affected by relocation and the intervention level for implementing relocation as well as source term has been quantitatively described. All the calculations presented in this paper have been done using the European package for accident consequence assessment COSYMA. To estimate the influence of the assumptions made in the calculations on the general applicability of the results, a sensitivity study has been carried out for source term variations and sampling of weather sequences.

For some years, the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) has launched an R&D program which aimed at providing the tools for improving the mastering of severe accidents. Within this program, the VULCANO experimental facility is operated to perform experiments with prototypic corium (corium of realistic chemical composition including depleted UO2). This is coupled with the use of specific high-temperature instrumentation requiring in situ cross calibration. This paper is devoted to the "spreading experiments" performed in the VULCANO facility, in which the effects of flow and solidification are studied. Due to the complex behavior of corium in the solidification range, an interdisciplinary approach has been used combining thermodynamics of multicomponent mixtures, theological models of silicic semisolid materials, heat transfer at high temperatures, free-surface flow of a fluid with temperature-dependant properties. Twelve high-temperature spreading tests have been performed and analyzed. The main experimental results are the good spreadability of corium-concrete mixtures having large solidification ranges even with viscous silicic melts, the change of microstructure due to cooling rates, the occurrence of a large thermal contact resistance at the corium-substrate interface, the presence of a steep viscosity gradient at the surface, the transient concrete ablation. Furthermore, the experiments showed the presence of the gaseous inclusions in the melt even without concrete substrate. This gas release is linked to the local oxygen content in the melt which is function of the nature of the atmosphere, of the phases (FeOx, UOy,...) and of the substrate. These tests with prototypic material have improved our knowledge on corium and contributed to validate spreading models and codes which are used for the assessment of corium mastering concepts.

J	Manturov, G				Manturov, G			Effects of nuclear data library on BFS and ZPPR k(eff) analysis results	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							REACTOR	The data-processing system CONSYST/ABBN coupled with the ABBN-93 nuclear data library (NDL) was used in the analysis of BFS-62 and ZPPR JUPITER experiment series fast reactor mixed oxide cores, applying the Japan Nuclear Cycle Development Institute (JNC), Japan, core calculation code CITATION-FBR. The FFCP cell code was used to take into account the spatial cell heterogeneity and resonance effects based on the subgroup approach. The NDL effect has been studied by comparing the results calculated using the ABBN-93 nuclear data with the former ones obtained at JNC based on the JENDL-3.2 NDL. Calculation analysis results for the k(eff) parameter for four BFS-62 cores as well as for three ZPPR JUPITER experiment series cores (ZPPR-9, ZPPR-13A, and ZPPR-17A) have been obtained The estimated uncertainty in the keff values caused by possible errors in calculation of the applied corrections was estimated to be similar to0.3% in the case of the ZPPR cores and 0.2% for the BFS-62 cores. The NDL effect determined by applying the ABBN-93 nuclear data in the JNC calculation route for the k(eff) parameter appeared to be similar to0.3% for the ZPPR and BFS-62 cores with plutonium. As for BFS-62 uranium-loaded cores, the NDL effect was similar to0.1%. Sensitivity analysis was applied, and it has shown that the main contributors to the NDL effect are uranium, plutonium, and iron cross sections. This work is closely related to the JNC-Institute of Physics and Power Engineering, Russian Federation, collaboration on experimental investigation of excess weapon plutonium disposition in the BN-600 reactor using the BFS facility.

J	Fan, S; Rong, J; Zhang, H; Zhao, Z				Fan, S; Rong, J; Zhang, H; Zhao, Z			The fragment distribution of Nb, Au, and Pb from proton-induced reactions with energies ranging from 100 MeV to 3 GeV	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							STATISTICAL DECAY MODEL; HEAVY-ION COLLISIONS; NUCLEAR-REACTIONS; CROSS-SECTIONS; TRANSPORT	The formation cross section of the nuclide production of proton-induced reactions with intermediate energy is important for a variety of applications. For instance, the mass and charge distribution of residual products produced in the spallation reactions needs to be studied because it can provide useful information for the disposal of nuclear waste and residual radioactivity generated by the spallation neutron target system. With our current work, we have developed the Many Stage Dynamical Model (MSDM) based on the Cascade-Exciton Model (CEM). By introducing Mshnik's recent work on the CEM code, the MSDM code and the Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD) plus Statistical Decay Model (SDM) (QMD +SDM) and QMD plus FISSION (QMD +FISSION) models are adopted; we use them to investigate the mass distribution of Nb, Au, and Pb of proton-induced reactions with energies from 100 MeV to 3 GeV. The agreement between the developed MSDM simulations and the measured data as well as the QMD +FISSION model are good in the energy range of 100 MeV to 3 GeV, and deviations mainly show up in the mass range of 90 to 140 in the high energy of protons incident on the Au and Pb target for the MSDM and QMD +FISSION model simulations. The QMD+SDM can reproduce only part of the spallation fragments and cannot reproduce the fission fragments of the measured data.

RAPID-L is designed for a lunar base power system. It is one of the variants of the RAPID ((R) under bar efueling by (A) under bar ll (P) under bar ins (I) under bar ntegrated (D) under bar esign) fast reactor concept, which enables quick and simplified refueling. The essential feature of the RAPID concept is that the reactor core consists of an integrated fuel assembly instead of conventional fuel subassemblies. In this small-size reactor core, 2700 fuel pins are integrated and encased in a fuel cartridge. Refueling is conducted by replacing a fuel cartridge. The reactor can be operated without refueling for up to 10 yr. Unique challenges in reactivity control systems design have been addressed in the RAPID-L concept. The reactor has no control rod but involves the following innovative reactivity control systems: lithium expansion modules (LEM) for inherent reactivity feedback, lithium injection modules (LIM)for inherent ultimate shutdown, and lithium release modules (LRM) for automated reactor startup. All these systems adopt Li-6 as a liquid poison instead of B4C rods. In combination with LEMs, LIMs, and LRMs, RAPID-L can be operated without an operator. This reactor concept is also applicable to the terrestrial fast reactors. In this paper, the RAPID-L reactor concept and its transient characteristics are presented.

J	Weaver, KD; Herring, JS				Weaver, KD; Herring, JS			Performance of thorium-based mixed-oxide fuels for the consumption of plutonium in current and advanced reactors	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						mixed-oxide fuel; plutonium reduction; thorium fuel		A renewed interest in thorium-based fuels has arisen lately based on the need for proliferation resistance, longer fuel cycles, higher burnup, and improved waste form characteristics. Recent studies have been directed toward homogeneously mixed, heterogeneously mixed, and seed-and-blanket thorium-uranium oxide fuel cycles that rely on "in situ" use of the bred-in U-233. However, due to the higher initial enrichment required to achieve acceptable burnups, these fuels are encountering economic constraints. Thorium can nevertheless play a large role in the nuclear fuel cycle, particularly in the reduction of plutonium inventories. While uranium-based mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel will decrease the amount of plutonium in discharged fuel, the reduction is limited due to the breeding of more plutonium (and higher actinides) from the U-238. Here, we present calculational results and a comparison of the potential burnup of a thorium-based and uranium-based mixed-oxide fuel in a light water reactor. Although the uranium-based fuels outperformed the thorium-based fuels in achievable burnup, a depletion comparison of the initially charged plutonium (both reactor and weapons grade) showed that the thorium-based fuels outperformed the uranium-based fuels by more that a factor of 2, where > 70% of the total plutonium in the thorium-based fuel is consumed during the cycle. This is significant considering that the achievable burnups of the thorium-based fuels were 1.4 to 4.6 times less than the uranium-based fuels for similar plutonium enrichments. For equal specific burnups of similar to60 MWd/kg (i.e., using variable plutonium weight percentages to give the desired burnup), the thorium-based fuels still outperform the uranium-based fuels by more than a factor of 2, where the total plutonium consumption in a three-batch, 18-month cycle was 60 to 70%. This is fairly significant considering that 10 to 15% (by weight) more plutonium is needed in the thorium-based fuels as compared to the uranium-based fuels to achieve these burnups. Furthermore, thorium-based fuels could also be used as a strategy for reducing the amount of long-lived nuclides (including the minor actinides) and thus the radiotoxicity in spent nuclear fuel. Although the breeding of U-233 is a concern, the presence of U-232 and its daughter products (namely Tl-208) can aid in making this fuel self-protecting, and/or enough U-238 can be added to denature the fissile uranium. From these calculations, it appears that thorium-based fuel for plutonium incineration is superior when compared to uranium-based fuel and should be considered as an alternative to traditional MOX in both current and future/advanced reactor designs.

We have investigated: (1) the residual background of a large well type NaI detector, i.e., when shielded with 10 cm of lead and operated deep underground, (2) low concentrations of primordial radioactivity in glass used for photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and (3) the activity in whole tubes. The residual background of the NaI units is dominated by gamma radiation from potassium, thorium and uranium in the PMT, which severely limits their sensitivity. Activity in tubes made of new high purity glass Was close to the detection level. The prospects of a new generation of low-level NaI detectors with these tubes are discussed.

It is known to provide high neutron fluences below 100 keV. In this work, the possibility of applying this method to the measurement of the neutron-induced fission cross-section of shortlived actinides and in particular of the 77 eV isomer of U-235 is investigated. Numerical simulations and a test-experiment using a photovaltaic cell fission detector demonstrate the feasibility of such a measurement at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center using 800 MeV proton-induced spallation to provide source neutrons.

This work was performed on a large spatio-temporal scale in order to integrate the fluctuations of the matrix. More than 200 samples monthly collected from January 1983 to December 1996 along the French Atlantic and English Channel coasts, have been measured as part of the Permanent Observatory of the radioactivity programme of the Institut de Radioprotection et de S (u) over cap rete Nucleaire (IRSN). A relationship has been established between experimental mass attenuation coefficients at low energy and the K-40 concentrations of the samples, where the latter showed the same temporal variation as the I-127 concentration (iodine stable isotope). Based on the mean correction factors determined in the present work, a simplified method is proposed to quantify the content of I-129. The direct gamma-X spectrometry results obtained in this way are in good agreement with those reported by Patti et al. (Radioprotection 23 (1988) 381) using neutron activation analysis for the samples collected between October 1983 and December 1984 at Herquemoulin, located near the La Hague reprocessing plant.

A centralized tool employing a gamma-ray source of very low radioactivity (1.85 MBq) was used. This logging tool was tested using Cs-137 and Ba-133 sources with a 37 mm (diameter) by 75 mm NaI (TI) scintillation detector. Ten source-detector configurations were analyzed using Cs-137, and another nine source-detector configurations are analyzed, using Ba-133 source, both for four geophysical models, having a borehole diameter of 90mm. Regression analysis on the laboratory logging data for each studied configuration was carried out in order to establish calibration equations for ash prediction. The optimum configuration for the logging stockpile probe using Cs-137 source was determined to be 80mm source to detector spacing, and 80mm iron thickness shielding. This configuration gives the best results for ash prediction. The root mean square (rms) deviation for ash is 1.52%. The optimum configuration for the logging stockpile probe using Ba-133 source is determined to be 85 mm source to detector spacing, and 50 mm iron thickness shielding.

An improved synthesis of the precursor of anti-[F-18]FACBC has been devised which demonstrates high stereoselectivity and suitability for large-scale preparations. An automated radiosynthesis has been developed which provides anti-[F-18]FACBC in 24% decay-corrected yield. Additionally, the major non-radioactive species present in doses of anti-[F-18]FACBC has been identified as anti-1-amino-3-hydroxycyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid. Together, these results are important steps towards the routine production of anti-[F-18]FACBC for human use. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The first method is preferable, because it sharply decreases the amount of radioactive wastes that require further reprocessing and storage. The decontamination is to be done using passivating compounds. This increases the corrosion resistance of steel with the same or greater treatment effectiveness, prevents radionuclides from leaving the surfaces of equipment, entering the coolant, and being disseminated along the loop, and decreases the sorption of radionuclides on surfaces, which results in improved radiation conditions during the subsequent operation of the nuclear power system.

J	Sivintsev, YV				Sivintsev, YV			Was the Chazhma accident a Chernobyl of the Far East?	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The 1985 reactivity accident on a submarine in bukhta Chazhma was accompanied by a substantial emission of fission products and activational radionuclides whose total activity reached 5 MCi. Some specialists have compared this emission to the emission resulting from the 1986 accident in Chernobyl, neglecting the large difference in the radionuclide composition: short-lived products of prompt fission of uranium (with an admixture of activational Co-60) in Chazhma and long-lived fission products accumulated over the run of the power reactor with an admixture of short-lived nuclides from the spontaneous excursion of the RBMK-1000 reactor in the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. It is shown that the emission of long-lived radioecologically significant radionuclides in Chazhma was approximately 0.79 Ci, while in the Chernobyl accident this emission was 90 MCi. A quantitative comparison is presented of the activity and radionuclide composition between the accidents in Chazhma and Chernobyl taking account of the fraction of long-lived radionuclides and neglecting the radioactive inert gases. These quantitative estimates are used to show that the Chazhma accident is not analogous to the 1986 accident in Chernobyl.

J	Simon, GG; Sokcic-Kostic, M				Simon, GG; Sokcic-Kostic, M			Fissile elements monitoring system with coincidence counting for waste package characterisation	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			English	Article								The former reprocessing plant Karlsruhe (WAK, Wiederaufarbeitungsanlage Karlsruhe) is since several years in the phase of decommissioning. The radioactive waste to be handled during decommissioning contains fissile material in addition to beta and gamma radioactivity. This material must be analysed and quantified before conditioning and transportation to interim and/or final storage. The drums with raw waste are transported from WAK to the waste treatment facility of the research center Karlsruhe for treatment, product control and analysis. A high gamma radiation field must be considered when performing the measurements. For the waste characterisation a sensitivity of 10 mg/Pu-eff. is required for 200 or 400 l drums filled with raw waste, containing up to 100 g Pu. The expected gamma flux can be as high as 1 Sv/h at the drum surface. New measuring components were developed for the operation in such a high gamma field. The drum measuring device is an advanced application of the monitor system FEMOS which was developed in co-operation with FZK and RWE Nukem GmbH. FEMOS is a specially developed monitor to detect fissile materials for waste characterisation and it is also suitable to identify the main neutron emitters.

The OMEGA Cryogenic Target Handling System will fill plastic targets with high-pressure DT (150 MPa) at 300 to 500 K, cool them down to cryogenic temperature (<25 K), form the DT ice layer, and transport the targets to the OMEGA laser target chamber. Targets will then be shot with the 60-beam 30-kJ OMEGA laser. A tritium removal system has been designed to remove tritium from effluents associated with operation of the target chamber and its associated diagnostic antechambers, vacuum pumping systems, and target insertion systems. The design of the target chamber tritium removal system (TCTRS) is based on catalytic oxidation of DT and tritiated methane to tritiated water (DTO), followed by immobilization of DTO on molecular sieves. The design of the TCTRS presented a challenge due to the low tritium release limits dictated by the tritium license at UR/LLE. Aspen Plus, a commercial software package intended for the simulation and design of chemical processing systems operating at steady state, was used to simulate and design the TCTRS. A second commercial software package, Aspen ADSIM, was used to simulate and design the TCTRS molecular sieve beds, which operate at unsteady state.

By changing systematically the duct diameter, the blanket thickness, and the boron content in the plug, analytical representations of the helium production could be obtained as functions of these parameters based on the Monte Carlo results. Their dependencies on the blanket composition could also be clarified. The analytical formulas thus obtained were applied to clarify the shielding design condition required to satisfy the shielding design criteria for a DT fusion reactor.

Using information available in published reports, doses and excess health risks of the most serious contaminants in each study are compared for representative maximally and typically exposed individuals. For both the representative maximally exposed individual and the representative typically exposed individual, the highest excess risks of cancer incidence were from I-131 released from Hanford, Nevada Test Site, and Oak Ridge and Rn-222 released from Fernald (with central estimates for maximally exposed individuals approaching or exceeding 10(-2)); the lowest risks for both maximally and typically exposed individuals were from Pu-239/240 and carbon tetrachloride released from Rocky Flats. Excess health risks to the representative maximally exposed individual were at or below 10(-4) for releases from Rocky Flats. For representative typically exposed individuals, the excess risks from releases of mixed radionuclides in the Clinch River (Oak Ridge), PCBs in East Fork Poplar Creek (Oak Ridge), and both plutonium and carbon tetrachloride released from Rocky Flats were mostly below 10(-5).

J	Papp, Z; Dezso, Z				Papp, Z; Dezso, Z			Estimate of the dose-increment due to outdoor exposure to gamma rays from uranium progeny deposited on the soil around a coal-fired power plant in Ajka town, Hungary	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						dose, external; soil; uranium; power plant, coal-burning	RATE CONVERSION FACTORS; RADIONUCLIDE CONCENTRATIONS; EXTERNAL EXPOSURE; PHOTON EMITTERS; RADIATION; RADIOACTIVITY; RA-226; REGION; POLAND	Brown coal unusually rich in uranium is burnt in a coal-fired power plant that lies inside the confines of a small industrial town named Ajka, Hungary, and has been operational since 1943. The U-238 (Ra-226) activity discharged to the atmosphere per unit electrical energy produced was about 330-400 GBq (GW y)(-1), which is 66-80 times more than that was estimated by UNSCEAR (1988) as a characteristic value for old type coal-fired power plants [5 GBq (GW y)(-1)]. The objective of this study was the experimentally established assessment of the artificial increment in the dose from external exposure to gamma rays of terrestrial radionuclides outdoors. Soil samples were collected in and near Ajka from 81 locations. The samples were investigated by Ge(Li) gamma spectrometry. Considerably elevated concentrations of uranium and its progeny have been measured in most of the samples that were collected near to the plant. Concentrations of U-238 and Ra-226 in the top (0-5 cm depth) layer of undisturbed soil at public areas inside town were 4.7 times higher, on average, than those in the uncontaminated deeper layers. Dose rate in air (air kerma) from external exposure to terrestrial gamma rays outdoors at a height of I m and effective doses were estimated from the measured activity 1concentrations using some relevant literature data. The estimated artificial increment in the dose rate in air was, on average, 32.8, 10.3, and 102.1 nGy h(-1) at public areas, vegetable gardens, and backyards, respectively. The mean artificial increment in the annual per caput effective dose from external exposure to terrestrial radionuclides outdoors is 21.8 muSv y(-1). The collective dose commitment per unit energy generated from outdoor exposure to the deposited uranium progeny is about 8.0-9.1 person Sv (GW y)(-1), which is 67-76 times more than that evaluated by UNSCEAR (1988) for a typical "old" coal-fired power plant [0.12 person Sv (GW y)(-1)]. Ajka is a suitable place for studying the dosimetric consequences of the utilization of coal for energy production experimentally.

J	Aden, J; Scott, BR				Aden, J; Scott, BR			Modeling variability and uncertainty associated with inhaled weapons-grade PuO2	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						plutonium; Monte Carlo; lungs, human; International Commission on Radiological Protection	AEROSOL DEPOSITION; PARTICLE DEPOSITION; HUMAN LUNGS	The work presented relates to developing a stochastic version of the ICRP 66 respiratory tract deposition model and applying the stochastic model to characterize the variability/uncertainty associated with inhaled PuO2 for a hypothetical population of nuclear workers engaged in light work-related exercise. The parameter uncertainty/variability distributions used are essentially the same as the FORTRAN-based stochastic deposition model of Bolch et al. known as LUDUC (LUng Dose Uncertainty Code). Based on Crystal Ball software, this stochastic deposition model includes particle polydispersity, which Botch et al. did not discuss. This paper first compares model-simulated regional deposition probability distributions to deterministic results based on LUDEP (LUng Dose Evaluation Program) software, which implements the ICRP 66 deterministic deposition model. For these comparisons, a particle density of 3 g cm(-3) (for hypothetical radioactive particles) was used. The range of possible depositions generated by LUDUC and the Crystal Ball program results revealed LUDEP's limitations. Even though LUDEP tends to use parameters that represent average parameter values for adult males, it overestimates deposition in the lower regions of the lung for most of the population. The Crystal Ball program was then used to generate radioactivity intake distributions for single and multiple PuO2 particle intakes by a hypothetical population of nuclear workers for the stochastic intake (STI) paradigm. These distributions of radioactivity intake are evaluated for the five primary regions of the respiratory tract as defined in the ICRP Publication 66. The results reveal that when a particle has been deposited, the radioactivity is likely to be low if it is in the lower regions (< 10 Bq for the bb and AI regions), but it may be quite large in the upper regions (as much as 600 Bq for the ET1, and ET2 regions), and the distributions for radioactivity become less and less skewed to the right, as particles penetrate deeper within the respiratory tract.

With the large amount of plutonium handling in numerous projects including the development of mixed oxide (MOX) fuel, Pu-238 power sources, etc., hand glove protection for the emitted alpha, beta, and low energy photons is an important issue. Leaded gloves are the prime shields used for radiological hand protection. U.S. Department of Energy laboratories require a substitute material for the lead oxide in the gloves as a way to reduce mixed waste. To solve this problem, a new blend of non-hazardous materials that have the same radiological properties and approximately the same cost of production have been investigated. The investigations have produced alternative materials using calculations and experiments. The selection of the constituent compounds for the new composite materials was based on the k-absorption edge energy of the main constituent element(s) in the compounds. The formulations of these composites were fashioned on the principle of blending Neoprene rubber formulation with several constituent compounds. Calculations based on the Lambert-Beer attenuation law together with the mass attenuation coefficient values from the XCOM cross section database program were used to determine the transmission fractions of these proposed composite materials. Selected composite materials that compared favorably with the leaded-Neoprene were fabricated. These fabricated composite materials were tested with attenuation experiments and the results were in excellent agreement with the calculations using the Lambert-Beer attenuation law.

The monitoring of internal exposures involves gamma spectrometry of the whole body (whole body counting) and measurements of excreta samples. Medical procedures involving internal administration of radioactive radionuclides are widely and commonly used. Medical radionuclides are typically short-lived, but high activities are generally administered, whereas occupational radionuclides are mostly long-lived and, if present, are found generally in relatively smaller quantities. The aim of the present work was to study the interference of some common medical radionuclides (Tl-201, Tc-99m, Co-57, and I-131) with the detection of internal occupational exposures to natural uranium and to (CS)-C-137. Workers having undergone a medical procedure with one of the radionuclides mentioned above were asked to give frequent urine samples and to undergo whole body and thyroid counting with phoswich detectors operated at the Nuclear Research Center Negev. Urine and whole body counting monitoring were continued as long as radioactivity was detectable by gamma spectrometry. The results indicate that the activity of medical radionuclides may interfere with interpretation of occupational intakes for months after administration.
