With this aim, the quite realistic concept of XADS chosen for our investigations, comes from the preliminary studies done by Framatome ANP. First, we simulate this basic concept with different fuels and characterize the time evolution of the conceivable fuels, especially with minor actinides. Secondly, we consider the neutronic parameters in view of an extrapolation of the XADS toward a large ADS. We also consider some alternative solutions to reduce the flux peak in the first assemblies around the spallation target of a large ADS and consequently to improve the shape factor and the efficiency of the core. Finally, we focus on the generation of U-233 based on a plutonium and minor actinide fuel associated to thorium oxide to start power Molten Salt Reactors (MSR) and to accelerate the transition toward a Th-232/U-233 cycle which offers an interesting option for nuclear waste reduction and nuclear energy production during many centuries.

J	Hwang, YS; Kang, CH; Kim, SG; Park, HS				Hwang, YS; Kang, CH; Kim, SG; Park, HS			Progress of radioactive waste management in Korea	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						radioactive waste management; spent nuclear fuel; HLW disposal; DUPIC		In Korea, sixteen nuclear reactors are in operation and by 2015, there will be a total of twenty-six nuclear reactors. The current generating capacity is 12,990 MWe with a share of 40.7% of the total production of electricity. This active nuclear program causes an inevitable increase in the build-up of radioactive waste, including spent fuel. Therefore, reliable and effective management of radioactive waste and spent fuel has become a key to the continuous growth of the nuclear power program. As of the end of 2000, a total of 57,270 drums of low and intermediate level waste (LILW) were generated from the nuclear power plants (NPPs). And the total amount of LILW from NPPs, RI applications from more than 1,700 users, and decommissioning will increase to 256,520 drums by 2020. Also, the cumulative amount of spent fuel reached 4,758 MTU by the end of 2000 and will jump to 18,615 MTU by 2020. According to the new national planning, AFR storage facilities for spent fuels will be built by 2016 and a repository for LILW radioactive disposal will be in operation by 2008. Even though Korea has a "wait and see policy" for spent fuel management, several alternative studies on spent fuel management such as DUPIC have been carried out. In parallel, R&D activities to develop the needed technologies for the permanent disposal of spent fuel and HLW have been implemented. In addition, active R&D on the treatment of radioactive waste from the various nuclear fuel cycles as well as the decontamination and decommissioning of nuclear facilities are in progress. Many of these studies are being pursued in the form of regional as well as international cooperation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Baryschpolec, LM; Wade, DM; Herring, CM; Saylor, MC				Baryschpolec, LM; Wade, DM; Herring, CM; Saylor, MC			Application of mathematical modeling-based algorithms to "off-carrier" cobalt-60 irradiation processes	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th International Meeting on Radiation Processing	MAR, 2001	ARIGON, FRANCE			database; dosimetry; modeling; parametric; point kernel; process control; process stream; radiation processing; radiation sterilization; simulation	INDUSTRIAL	The irradiation of materials and products "off carrier" has historically been performed using a "drop-and-read" methodology whereby the radioisotope source is raised and lowered repeatedly until the desired absorbed dose is achieved. This approach is time consuming from both a manpower and process perspective. Static irradiation-based processes can also be costly because of the need for repeated experimental verification of target dose delivery. In our paper we address the methods used for predicting Ethicon Endo Surgery's (EES's) off-carrier absorbed dose distributions. The scenarios described herein are complex due to the fact that the on-carrier process stream exhibits a wide range of densities and dose rates. The levels of observed complexity are attributed to the "just-in-time" production strategy and its related requirements as they apply to the programming of EES's cobalt-60 irradiators. Validation of off-carrier processing methodologies requires sophisticated parametric-based systems utilizing mathematical algorithms that predict off-carrier absorbed dose rate relative to the on-carrier process stream components. Irradiation process simulation is achieved using a point kernel computer modeling approach, coupled with database generation and maintenance. Dose prediction capabilities are validated via routine and transfer standard dosimetry. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Newton, D				Newton, D			Human biokinetics of inhaled terbium oxide	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							LUNG CLEARANCE; MONODISPERSE; PARTICLES	Four healthy men inhaled a monodisperse aerosol of Tb-160-labelled terbium oxide particles. The behaviour of the tracer was studied through measurements of body radioactivity and of its urinary and faecal excretion. Estimated early faecal losses in the four subjects ranged from 3% to 31% of the initial respiratory-tract deposit; most of the residue had become systemic within a year, with the principal deposit apparently in bone. Interference from this systemic deposit prevented accurate determination of the long-term pulmonary clearance kinetics, but the pattern was broadly what would be expected for Type M materials in the ICRP's Human Respiratory Tract Model. Averaged trends in the whole-body residue after similar to1 year suggest a clearance half-life of approximate to5 y.

J	Leggett, RW				Leggett, RW			Reliability of the ICRP'S dose coefficients for members of the public. III. Plutonium as a case study of uncertainties in the systemic biokinetics of radionuclides	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							URINARY-EXCRETION; UNITED-STATES; MODEL; METABOLISM; ASSOCIATION; ABSORPTION; AMERICIUM; DOSIMETRY; RETENTION; REGISTRY	This paper is a case study of the validity of different data sources and modelling approaches commonly used to build biokinetic models for radionuclides. The paper examines the basis and apparent predictive accuracy of each of the biokinetic models for Pu used over the years by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), in view of recent improvements in the database. The results of this study and similar retrospective studies for other elements suggest the following five points. (1) Extrapolation of biokinetic data from laboratory animals to man is particularly uncertain for the liver due to qualitative differences among species in the handling of many elements by this organ. (2) As a 'default' approach to biokinetic modelling or model assessment, biokinetic data for unhealthy human subjects should be given higher weight than information extrapolated across animal species or chemical families, but there are counter-examples. (3) Little confidence can be placed in biokinetic model predictions for long times after exposure based solely on curve fits to short-term biokinetic data. (4) Bioassay and dosimetry models for a radionuclide should not be developed separately. (5) Where feasible, the systemic biokinetic model for a radionuclide should be developed within a physiologically realistic model structure, because this allows biokinetic data from experimental studies to be supplemented with physiological information, provides a basis for extrapolation of data across animals species or chemical families. results in models that can be used for both bioassay interpretation and dosimetry, and provides a logical basis for extrapolation of data to subgroups of the populatuion (e.g., various ages) or to times outside the period of observation.

J	Aage, HK; Korsbech, U; Bargholz, K				Aage, HK; Korsbech, U; Bargholz, K			Early detection of radioactive fallout by gamma spectrometry	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								Radioactive fallout should be detected as early as possible. A new and efficient method for detection of low-level irradiation from manmade radioactivity is developed. Radiation abnormalities are detectable down to air kerma rate, of 0.5 to 1.0 nGy h(-1) for Cs-137 and even lower for I-131 For multi-gamma energy radioactivity the detection level is 2.6-3.5 nGy h(-1). A standard NaI detector and a 512-channel analyser are used together with noise adjusted singular value decomposition (NASVD). Statistical noise is removed and the measured spectra are reproduced using spectral components produced by NASVD. Stripping is not used and false alarms due to washout of atmospheric radon progeny are almost eliminated. Detection levels and the criteria for setting warning and alarm levels are discussed. The method may also be useful in other situations, for example where low-level signals from radioactive sources need to be detected.

J	Takahashi, F; Endo, A; Yamaguchi, Y				Takahashi, F; Endo, A; Yamaguchi, Y			Dose assessment from activated sodium within a body in criticality accidents	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								Some data were derived using recent sophisticated methods to rapidly convert specific activity of induced (24)Na to average dose over a whole body in criticality accidents. Monte Carlo calculations using the MCNP-4B code were performed to study energy spectra of neutrons and gamma rays for some criticality systems with fissile uranium. Absorbed dose to the human body and the activation of sodium were also analysed against external radiation by simulations using a MIRD-5 type phantom and the calculated energy spectra. It was found that the neutron dose assessment from induced (24)Na would be important to give medical staff initial guidance for treatment of a victim. However, the energy distribution of incident neutrons to the human body did not significantly influence the conversion from the specific activity of (24)Na to dose from gamma rays induced within a body. Analyses were made to clarify the dependence of conversion from (24)Na specific activity to neutron dose on the orientation toward the source and the size of the human body. The total dose estimated based upon the obtained data ranged from 33 mGy to 514 mGy for a given specific activity of 1.4 kBq (24)Na per g (23)Na for some criticality assemblies. This study suggested that the size of uranium solution and material around the fuel should be defined to properly estimate the total dose, including the dose from external photons.

Data are reported of indoor radon measurements with etched track detectors and those are used for dosimetric estimations. Moreover, data are reported on soil gas and soil radon concentrations in Arnea, as well as radon and uranium concentrations in water samples. From the measured radon concentrations in water samples the contribution to the overall dose has been calculated. For a period of I month, indoor radon and progeny activity has also been monitored in the dwelling that has the maximum indoor radon concentration in Greece. This dwelling is in Arnea and the dose delivered to the inhabitants has been calculated. The mean annual effective dose due to indoor radon was 4.5 mSv and about 11% of this was due to the use of water. Mean soil gas concentration and soil radon concentration were (90 +/- 30) kBq m(-3) (p < 0.05) and (30 +/- 5) kBq m(-3) (p < 0.05) respectively. Mean uranium concentration of the water samples was (98 +/- 13) mBq l(-1) (p < 0.05).

Fifty participants. free from medical problems, were recruited from two communities: a rural area where drinking water, supplied from drilled wells, contained elevated levels of uranium and an urban area where the water supplied by the municipal water system contained < I mug l(-1). Uranium intake through food, drinking water and other beverages was monitored using the duplicate diet approach. Intake and excretion were measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in samples collected concurrently from the same individuals over a 3 d period. The range of f(1) values was between 0.001 and 0.06, with a median of 0.009. These values were independent of gender, age, duration of exposure, daily total uranium intake and allocation of intake between food and water. Consistent with the recommendation of ICRP Publication 69, 78% were below 0.02.

The ICRP Task Group on Internal Dosimetry (INDOS) has developed a guidance document on application of the HRTM in situations where using specific information can improve dose assessments. INDOS is now revising the worker exposure documents (ICRP Publications 68 and 78). Application of the HRTM requires a review of the lung-to-blood absorption characteristics of inhaled radionuclides. Where appropriate. compound-specific absorption parameter values will be derived. and other compounds will be assigned to default Types using current information. Although no major changes to the HRTM are envisaged, this revision provides an opportunity for some refining and updating in the light of experience and new information.

Stereological sampling methods and auto radiography were used. Pu particles were identified by microscopic examination of autoradiographs and localised in one of six normal anatomic sites and two sites of fibrosis (parenchymal, non-parenchymal). Particle activity was determined by counting the number of tracks emanating from the particles. Over 50% of the Pu activity was localised in sites of fibrosis, which had significantly higher than average activity for the lung. Over 40% of the activity was in lung parenchyma. Activity in the bronchovascular interstitium was significantly lower than average.

These data were therefore applied to the HRTM by modifying selected parameters, namely the transfer rate of Pu from the transformed state compartment and the fraction of Pu that transfers to the bound state compartment. Invoking the latter compartment into the modelling allowed a better representation of the long-term Pu retention as well as providing a convenient means of describing the workplace-specific characteristics of the different Pu aerosols found in the Mayak plant. In particular, the present model describes a significantly greater long-term retention of Pu nitrate aerosols in the lung compared with the Type M default.

For each material, values describing the time dependence of absorption were derived from the studies in animals and used with the ICRP human respiratory tract model to predict lung retention and cumulative amounts to blood for the volunteers inhaling the same materials. Comparison with the observed behaviour in the volunteers suggests that absorption of plutonium and gadolinium is reasonably species independent, and that data obtained from animal studies can be used to assess their biokinetic behaviour in humans.

Exposures resulting from these mining and processing operations usually involve intakes of mixtures of radionuclides. This work describes the development of a suite of first order, linear compartment models, based on the ICRP Publication 66 respiratory tract model. and an analytical solution to the decay equations, for assessing the consequences of such intakes. The computer programs based on these models directly compute excretion, organ retention and organ and whole-body doses for intakes of either single radionuclides or any mixture of radionuclides belonging to the same radioactive decay chain. The intake can he via inhalation, ingestion or injection, and can be acute, chronic or of limited duration. The starting concentration and degree of secular (dis)equilibrium can be specified for each radionuclide. No assumptions need to be made about the relative magnitudes of the radioactive half-lives of the different nuclides.

The sizes of uranium oxide and plutonium oxide particles were determined using a system based on CR-39 solid-state nuclear track detectors. The CR-39 plastic was exposed to the deposited particles across a 400 mum airgap. The exposed CR-39 was chemically etched to reveal clusters of tracks radially dispersed from central points. The number and location of the tracks were determined using an optical microscope with an XY motorised table and image analysis software. The sample mounting arrangement allowed individual particles to be simultaneously viewed with their respective track cluster. The predicted diameters correlated with the actual particle diameters, as measured using the optical microscope. The efficacy of the technique was demonstrated with particles of natural uranium oxide ((UO2)-U-nat) of known size. ranging from 4 to 150 mum in diameter. Two personal air sampler (PAS) filters contaminated with actinide particles were placed against CR-39 and estimated to have size distributions of 0.8 and 1.0 mum activity median aerodynamic diameter (AMAD).

Aerosols of radon and progeny, uranium ore dust. NpO2, PuO2 or Cm2O3 were considered for intercomparison with similar or different particle sizes. Dose-effect relationships for the frequency of malignant lung tumours appear linear up to a few Gy and then become infralinear at higher doses delivered to the lungs. The initial slope of the curves reflects the risk of induction of a lung tumour. The highest slopes of incidence were observed for radon and uranium ore dust (about 70 and 20% Gy(-1) respectively) for which the most homogeneous alpha dose distribution to the lungs is expected. In a general trend, increasing the alpha-activity of deposited particles (higher specific activity of constituent radioisotopes or larger particle size) decreases the risk.

For this purpose, preliminary results obtained after inhalation exposure of rats to MOX containing 2.5% Pu are reported and compared to those obtained previously with MOX containing 5% Pu. Dissolution parameter Values appear to increase when the amount of Pu decreases. Rapid fractions, F-r of 4 X 10(-3) (s.d. = 2 x 10(-3)) and 1 x 10(-3) (s.d. = 6 x 10(-4)) and slow dissolution rates, s(s), of 2 x 10(-4) d(-1) (standard deviation, sigma = 5 x 10(-5)) and 5 x 10(-5) d(-1) (sigma = 1 x 10(-5)) were derived for MOX containing 2.5 and 5% of Pu, respectively. Simulations were performed to assess uncertainties on dose due to experimental errors. The relative standard deviations of the dose per unit intake (DPUI) due to f(r) (4-8%), are far less than those due to s(s) (about 20%), which is the main parameter altering the dose. Although quite different dissolution parameter values were derived, similar DPUIs were obtained for MOX aerosols containing 2.5 and 5% Pu which appear close to that for default Type S values.

The problems associated with this approach are that natural uranium is always present in urine because of the ingestion of natural uranium in food and drink, and that the uncertainties in the intakes as assessed from excretion measurements can be quite large, because many assumptions concerning the exposure characteristics (time pattern of exposure, route of intake, chemical form, Solubility, biokinetics within the body) must be made. Applying currently available methods and instruments for the measurement of uranium in urine samples, DU incorporations of levels relevant with respect to potential health hazards can be detected reliably, even a long time after exposure.

The concentration and size distribution were determined. Activity median aerodynamic diameters were 1 mum (geometric standard deviation, sigma(g) = 3.7) and 2 mum (sigma(g) = 2.5), respectively, for glacis and turret. The mean air concentration was 120 Bq m(-3), i.e. 8.5 rng m(-3) of DU. Filters analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X ray diffraction showed two types of particles (fine particles and large molten particles) composed mainly of a mixture of uranium and aluminium. The uranium oxides were mostly U3O8, UO2.25 and probably UO3.01 and a mixed compound of U and Al. The kinetics of dissolution in three media (HCO3-, HCl and Gamble's solution) were determined using in-vitro tests. The slow dissolution rates were respectively slow, and intermediate between slow and moderate, and the rapid dissolution fractions were mostly intermediate between moderate and fast. According to the in-vitro results for Gamble's solution, and based on a hypothetical single acute inhalation of 90 Bq, effective doses integrated up to 1 y after incorporation were 0.54 and 0.56 mSv, respectively, for aerosols from glacis and turret. In comparison, the ICRP limits are 20 mSv y(-1) for workers and 1 mSv y(-1) for members of the public. A kidney concentration of approximately 0.1 mug U g(-1) was predicted and should not, in this case, lead to kidney damage.

As part of this study, a series of DU penetrators were fired at an Abrams tank and a Bradley fighting vehicle, and the aerosols generated by vehicle perforation were collected and characterised. A robust sampling system was designed to collect aerosols in this difficult environment and monitor continuously the sampler flow rates. The aerosol samplers selected for these tests included filter cassettes, cascade impactors, a five-stage cyclone and a moving filter. Sampler redundancy was an integral part of the sampling system to offset losses from fragment damage. Wipe surveys and deposition trays collected removable deposited particulate matter. Interior aerosols were analysed for uranium concentration and particle size distribution as a function of time. They were also analysed for uranium oxide phases, particle morphology and dissolution in vitro. These data, currently under independent peer review, will provide input for future prospective and retrospective dose and health risk assessments of inhaled or ingested DU aerosols. This paper briefly discusses the target vehicles, firing trajectories, aerosol samplers and instrumentation control systems, and the types of analyses conducted on the samples.

In 1993, the US government initiated a follow-up study of 33 Gulf War veterans who had been exposed to DU, many of whom contained embedded fragments of DU shrapnel in their bodies. The veterans underwent medical evaluation, whole-body counting, and urinalysis for uranium by kinetic phosphorescence analysis (KPA). Data are available from seven individuals who exceeded the detection limit for whole-body counting and also had elevated urinary uranium. Urinary excretion rates, in mug U g(-1) creatinine, were determined in 1997 and 1999. The body contents, in mg DU, were determined in 1997; it is assumed there were no significant decreases in total body content in the interim. For the 1997 data, the mean fractional excretion was (2.4 +/- 2.8) x 10(-5) g(-1) creatinine, and for the 1999 data, the mean was (1.1 +/- 0.6) x 10(-5) g(-1) creatinine. However, these means are not significantly different, nor is there any correlation of excretion rate with body content. Thus, human data available to date do not provide any basis for determining the effects of particle surface area, composition and solubility, and biological processes such as encapsulation, on the excretion rate.

These studies are necessary to improve the description, understanding and prediction of trace element kinetics and toxicity. In the case of internal contamination with radionuclides, speciation studies could help to improve both the biokinetic, and dosimetric models for radionuclides. There are different methods to approach the speciation of radionuclides in a biological system, depending on the degree of accuracy needed and the level of uncertainties accepted. Among them, computer modelling and experimental determination are complementary approaches. This paper describes what is known about speciation of actinides in blood, GI tract, liver and skeleton and of their consequences in terms of internal dosimetry. The conclusion is that such studies provide very valuable data and should be targeted in the future on some specific tissues and biomolecules.

These data are included in a large USTUR database and they are available to research scientists throughout the world, either as public records or through collaborative projects with the USTUR. The USTUR also operates the National Human Radiobiological Tissue Repository (NHRTR), in which portions of tissue samples collected at autopsy are kept. These samples, frozen at -70degreesC, may be used for molecular studies of the effects of radiation. Medical and radiation exposure histories of the tissue donors are available, as are the results of radiochemical analyses of adjacent portions of the samples.

In this paper, a consistent PBBK model structure will be described for use in dose assessments for organic C-14 and organically bound tritium (OBT), and also for (CO2)-C-14, based on the literature of human carbon metabolism, and on direct measurements of human excretion. CO2/HCO3- is a central compartment in carbon metabolism. The (CO2)-C-14 biokinetic model described in ICRP Publication 80 for the calculation of dose coefficients was found to omit early component of excretion necessary for the accurate interpretation of bioassay results. Recommendations on the requirements on dosimetry models for intakes of C-14 and OBT are made.

Radioactivities of P-32 in urine, blood and bone samples of the victims, who were severely exposed to neutrons, were measured. P-31 was induced in their whole bodies at the moment of the first nuclear release by the reaction P-31 (n,gamma) P-32 and S-32 (n, p) P-32. A realistic biokinetic model was assumed, as the exchange of P-32 between the extracellular fluid compartment and the soft tissue compartment occurs only through the intracellular compartment, and the model was used for preliminary calculations. Some acute excretion of P-32, caused by decomposition or elution of tissues which occurred at the time of the accident, may have happened in the victims' bodies in the first few days. The working hypotheses in the present work should initiate renewed discussion of P-32 biokinetics.

Accordingly, a scientific committee established jointly by the US National Council on Radiation Protection and the International Commission on Radiological Protection has been developing an approach to describing the biokinetics of radionuclides deposited in wounds and calculating dose to the wound site. This paper focuses on the analyses, performed principally using experimental animal data, that have led to the development of a biokinetic model for deposited soluble radionuclides as well as more insoluble forms, such as colloids, particles and fragments. The available data for injected soluble materials have provided a basis for categorising 48 different elements (from Be to Cm and representing all of the chemical groups, except halogens and noble gases) into four distinct retention groups. In general, the data are adequate for developing a mechanistically based biokinetic model, whose application is exemplified for soluble radionuclides.

A three-component exponential function is proposed to describe the elimination of H-3 from HTO with biological half-times of 10 d (99.00%), 40 d (0.98%) and 350 d (0.02%) respectively. The model predicts a committed effective dose of 1.7 x 10(-11) Sv Bq(-1), comparable with that of the current ICRP Publication 56 and 72 models, and estimates the retention of H-3 to within a factor of about 2 of the measured values up to 40 d after intake and about 5 at times longer than 100 d. The derivation of the model and the uncertainties associated with the various parameters are discussed.

Russia). The data were obtained by radiochemical analysis of soft tissue and bones samples collected at autopsy of 591 workers. The systemic plutonium distribution was determined in healthy individuals as well as in those with health impairment, specifically for those with liver diseases. Twenty-five years after the beginning of inhalation, systemic fractions in the liver and skeleton of individuals who were healthy at the time of death approximate the ratio 45%:45% proposed in the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) Publication 30. Pathological processes in the liver, accompanied by fatty dystrophy of hepatocytes, increased plutonium clearance from the liver. There was a considerable shift of the plutonium from the liver to the skeleton in individuals who died from liver disease. The average fractions of systemic plutonium in the liver and skeleton of those individuals were 14% and 78% respectively, which did not correspond to ICRP models, indicating a significant effect of disease conditions. Plutonium that was not redistributed was excreted. The urinary excretion rate of plutonium also correlated with state of health. The observed excretion as a fraction of systemic content was 1.64 x 10(-5) d(-1) for individuals in good health and 2.34 x 10(-5) d(-1) for individuals with various chronic diseases. The current models do not account for the influence of different pathological processes in the body on plutonium distribution and retention in systemic organs. This could have significant consequences for dosimetry calculations and risk estimations.

A few published studies have described the distribution of this element after chronic exposure and one of them has demonstrated an accumulation in the brain. In the present study, using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for the quantification of uranium, uranium transfer across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) has been assessed using the in situ brain perfusion technique in the rat. For this purpose, a physiological buffered bicarbonate saline at pH 7.4 containing natural uranium at a given concentration was perfused. After checking the integrity of the BBB during the perfusion, the background measurement of uranium in control rats without uranium in the perfusate was determined. The quantity of uranium in the exposed rat hemisphere, which appeared to be significantly higher than that in the control rats, was measured. Finally, the possible transfer of the perfused uranium not only in the vascular space but also in the brain parenchyma is discussed.

Current ICRP work on internal dosimetry includes the estimation of radiation doses to newborn infants from radionuclides ingested in mothers' milk. Infant doses will be calculated for maternal intakes by ingestion or inhalation of the radionuclides, radioisotopes of 3 1 elements, for which fetal dose coefficients have been published. In this paper, modelling approaches are examined, concentrating on models developed for iodine, caesium, polonium, alkaline earth elements and the actinides. Comparisons of model predictions show maximum overall transfer to milk following maternal ingestion during lactation of about 30% of ingested activity for I-131, 20% for Ca-45 and Cs-137, 10% for Sr-90, 1% for Po-210 and low values of less than 0.01% for Pu-239 and Am-241. The corresponding infant doses from milk consumption are estimated in preliminary calculations to be about two to three times the adult dose for Ca-45 and I-131, 70-80% of the adult dose for Sr-90, about 40% for Cs-137, 20% for Po-210, and <0.1% for Pu-239 and Am-241. Infant doses front radionuclides in breast milk are compared with doses to the offspring resulting from in utero exposures during pregnancy.

Female rats at different gestational stages or after delivery were exposed to C-14 in the form of sodium bicarbonate. thymidine and lysine by a single ingestion. Radioactivity in maternal tissues and conceptuses (placenta, fetal membrane and fetus) and in the newborn was determined at various times after ingestion. After exposure to these C-14 compounds, there was no significant difference between the C-14 concentration in the fetus and that in the maternal tissues, suggesting that the placenta has no effect in preventing or accelerating the placental transfer of C-14. The concentration and content of C-14 in the fetus and newborn were, however, dependent on the chemical form of C-14 and on the prenatal or neonatal stage at the time of ingestion. The result of the dose estimation showed that C-14-lysine gave significantly higher prenatal and neonatal doses than C-14-sodium bicarbonate or C-14-thymidine.

In 2001, an experiment carried out at Cattenom Power Plant during a unit outage in the presence of a leaking fuel cladding, based on measurement of alpha-emitting radioactive elements, made it possible to determine a realistic particle resuspension coefficient. A resuspension coefficient of 10(-6) m(-1) was adopted for operational radiological protection. An appropriate monitoring system for workers was set in place in collaboration with the occupational medicine and radiological protection department. It was based on prior estimation of the level of alpha contamination, and confirmed by swipe measurements, atmospheric surveillance by monitors, and collective analysis by nose blow samples from workers selected on the basis of their workstations, as well as supplementary individual measurements (monitoring of faeces). This surveillance made it possible to validate an appropriate work area monitoring system.

Low doses (similar to 80 muSv) were achievable because tracers of high isotopic purity Were used: Pu-237 (measurable by X ray spectrometry) and Pu-244 (measurable by accelerator mass spectrometry). Lung retention, amount in blood, uptake to the liver and skeleton, and urinary and faecal excretion were measured. The measured urinary excretion rates are about a factor of three higher than those predicted from urine excretion data measured following intravenous injection of plutonium to the same volunteers. If similar biokinetic behaviour occurs in workers exposed to plutonium nitrate, intakes by inhalation and corresponding committed doses assessed by urine bioassay could be consistently overestimated by a similar factor.

The personal dosemeter may be a reasonable indicator for external irradiation. However, it is necessary to control the possible internal contamination associated with the development of these techniques. The aim of this project is to analyse the most usual techniques and to establish programmes of internal monitoring for specific radionuclides (P-32, S-35, C-14, H-3, I-125 and I-131). To elaborate these programmes it was necessary to analyse the radioisotope techniques. Two models have been applied (NRPB and IAEA) to the more significant techniques, according to the physical and chemical nature of the radionuclides, their potential importance in Occupational exposure and the possible injury to the genetic material of the cell. The results allowed the identification of the techniques with possible risk of internal contamination. It was necessary to identify groups of workers that require individual monitoring. The risk groups have been established among, the professionals exposed, according to different parameters: the general characteristics of receptor, the radionuclides used (the same user can work with one, two or three radionuclides at the same time) and the results of the models applied. Also a control group was established. The study of possible intakes in these groups has been made by urinalysis and whole-body counter. The theoretical results are coherent with the experimental results. They have allowed guidance to individual monitoring to be proposed. Basically, the document shows: (I) the analysis of the radiosotopic techniques, taking into account the special containment equipment: (2) the establishment of the need of individual monitoring; and (3) the required frequency of measurements in a routine programme.

The methodology, after proper validation, was applied to investigate the dependence of urinary excretion rates for Pu-239 on the transfer rates given in the complete compartmental model. For this purpose, the default values of the transfer/absorption rates were modified by factors of 2 and 4 and urinary excretion rates were computed on 1, 10, 100. 1000 and 10,000 d post-intake. The percentage variations in the urinary excretion rates as a result of the modified transfer rates were computed for exposures to Type M and S aerosols of Pu-239. These results facilitated the identification of parameters significantly affecting the short-term and long-term urinary excretion rates. In addition, time variations of the predicted ratios of Pu-239 activity in daily urine to that in blood (excretion ratios) were studied for the three biokinetic models of plutonium: the ICRP 67 model, the modified ICRP 67 model with the compartment ST1 to urinary bladder removed and Luciani and Polig's model. All the computational results are presented and discussed in this paper.

Buena, where this study was conducted, is a small village on the coast in the northern part of Rio de Janeiro State, characterised by the presence of a large deposit of monazite sand. In this paper. the concentrations of U-238, U-234, Th-232, Th-228, Ra-228, Ra-226 and Pb-210 in faecal samples from inhabitants of this area were determined by a sequential analytical method. The results of the average concentrations in faeces of inhabitants of Buena are 9.4 +/- 3.4 mBq g(ash)(-1), for U-238, 9.2 +/- 4.0 mBq g(ash)(-1) for U-234, 7.0 +/- 4.2 mBq g(ash)(-1) for Th-232 256.1 +/- 134.6 mBq g(ash)(-1) for Th-228, 335.5 +/- 192.8 mBq g(ash)(-1) for Ra-228, 156.6 +/- 74.1 mBq g(ash)(-1) for Ra-226 and 66.7 +/- 17.7 mBq g(ash)(-1) for Pb-210. The results were compared with background concentrations from faecal Janeiro City. For most of the radionuclides analysed, the average concentration in samples from individuals living in Rio de faeces from inhabitants of the high natural radiation background was higher than the concentration found in Rio de Janeiro, considered a 'normal' background area.

Urinary excretion is primarily considered here because the monitoring of internal contamination of plutonium mainly relies on measurements of activity in urine samples. A previous paper has identified the most significant transfer rates for urinary plutonium excretion following an acute intake. That analysis is used here as a screening method to reduce the number of model parameters to be considered. A log-normal distribution was assumed for the probability distribution of the model parameters. The spread of the values, represented by the geometric standard deviation (GSD), is explicitly calculated, as few indications of the range of variation of systemic transfer rates are available. Different values for the GSD were considered. Assuming a certain GSD for all the systemic rate constants. random values of the rates were generated (by means of a Monte Carlo simulation with a Latin hypercube sampling scheme) and the resulting predictions of urine bioassay measurements were calculated. The comparison of the mean and variance of the predictions with the available data front several studies performed on different subjects provides information about the GSD of model parameters that represents the intersubject variation of transfer parameters.

Data obtained from various C-14 and H-3 experiments with rats and sheep have been analysed to assess the multi-component retention function of various organs and identify any relationship between half-times and component contribution. Our hypothesis was that component half-times for C-14 and H-3 are similar after intakes of organic compounds. Similarities in the tritium and carbon dynamics between rat and sheep were observed supporting the hypothesis. For fast and slow components of muscle half-time, allometric relationships have been derived. The results obtained could be used in the development of a human biokinetic model.

The individual parameters of each worker can be acquired for an exact geometric representation of his or her anatomy, which is particularly important for low-energy gamma ray emitting sources such as thorium, uranium, plutonium and other actinides. The software discussed here enables automatic creation of an MCNP input data file based on computed tomography (CT) scanning data. The utility was first tested for low- and medium-energy actinide emitters on Livermore phantoms, the mannequins generally used for lung counting, in order to compare the results of simulation and measurement. From these results, the utility's ability to study uncertainties in in vivo calibration were investigated. Calculations and comparison with the experimental data are presented and discussed in this paper.
