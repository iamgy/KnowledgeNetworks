At 40 degreesC, the presence of phthalate as a buffer component in the pH range of 2-6 has little effect on uranium release from brannerite. Bicarbonate increases uranium release and enhances the dissolution of brannerite. Compared to UO2, brannerite is more resistant to dissolution in bicarbonate solutions. In under-saturated conditions at 90 degreesC, the dissolution of brannerite is incongruent (preferential release of uranium) at pH 2 and nearly congruent at pH 11. TEM examinations reveal a polymorph of TiO2 (pH 2 specimen) and a fibrous Ti-rich material (pH 11 specimen) as secondary phases. XPS analyses indicate the existence of U(V) and U(VI) species on the surfaces of specimens both before and after leaching, and U(VI) was the dominant component on the specimen leached in the pH 11 solution.

Fusion welding processes produce secondary precipitates which dissolve in nitric acid, and hence solid-state processes are proposed. In this work, various dissimilar joining processes available for producing titanium-304L SS joints with adequate strength, ductility and corrosion resistance for this critical application are highlighted. Developmental efforts made at IGCAR, Kalpakkam are outlined. The possible methods and the microstructural-metallurgical properties of the joints along with corrosion results obtained with three phase (liquid, vapour, condensate) corrosion testing are discussed. Based on the results, dissimilar joint produced by the explosive joining process was adopted for plant application. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Uranium concentrations in function of time suggest the reduction of U(VI) to U(IV) by the humic acids which is occurring faster in real clay water than in synthetic clay waters. Humic acids induce also a competition to complex U(VI) in carbonate-containing solution, but they are not able to control the uranium concentration at high bicarbonate concentration (0.02 mol dm(-3)). Nevertheless they may play a role at low carbonate concentration. In our experimental conditions, the geochemical calculations indicate that two uranium secondary phases (U4O9 and UO2(c)) are susceptible to control the uranium concentration in solution. These calculations are in good agreement with results of the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. At the end of tests, uranium concentrations reach steady-state values between 3 x 10(-8) and 5 x 10(-8) mol dm(-3) in the bicarbonate-rich solutions. Although these concentrations are considered as conservative, they are 10-100 times higher than in natural Boom Clay. The consequence is that spent fuel could slowly dissolve in the interstitial clay water undersaturated with respect to UO2/UO2+x of the fuel. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For the safe operation of HTTR, the continuous and reliable measurement of the coolant activity is required to evaluate the fuel performance during normal operating conditions. In order to measure the primary coolant radioactivity (PCR), the PCR instrumentation of the safety protection system, the fuel failure detection (FFD) system and the primary coolant sampling system have been installed in the primary circuit. The PCR was less than 10(3) MBq/m(3), and measured Kr and Xe isotopes were less than 0.1 MBq/m(3) during the rise-to-power tests. The measured fractional releases are constant at 2 x 10(-9) up to 60% of the reactor power, and then increase to 7 x 10(-9) at full power operation. The prediction shows good agreement with the measured value. These results showed that the release mechanism varied from recoil to diffusion of the generated fission gas from the contaminated uranium in the fuel compact matrix.

Access to the outside of vacuum vessel is limited during assembly welding, because it is installed after assembled with surrounding toroidal field coils. From the radiological safety aspect, the vacuum vessel functions as a physical barrier to enclose radioactive materials. Therefore, construction of the vacuum vessel needs application of newly developed technologies on design, fabrication and examination. The technologies include design approach by finite element analysis, and partial penetration T welded joints to join ribs to outer shell. Several issues have to be resolved for applying those technologies to the vacuum vessel. This paper describes several newly developed technologies and key issues for such applications.

The electrophoretic assay indicated the existence of organically bound cadmium in cationic, anionic and neutral forms. Column experiments were found to be more suitable and accurate for the quantitative estimation compared to batch experiments. The existence and characterization of organically bound cadmium, supported the observation in the metal-organic acid interaction in soil plant system that the tendency of metals to interact with organic ligand led to metal solubilization, resulting into increased mobilization and, therefore, adds an important dimension to the mechanistic aspects of plant enrichment of the metals.

J	LaBrecque, JJ; Cordoves, PR				LaBrecque, JJ; Cordoves, PR			Application of the relative uranium-series disequilibrium in soil to locate and/or confirm precisely active fault traces: A new technique	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							RADON	Fault traces have been previously located from measurements of Rn-222 in soils taken a constant soil-depth across the fault trace. In this paper, we have studied the uranium-series disequilibria of the Ra-226, Rn-222 (gas) and Bi-214 radionuclides, not only for their horizontal spatial patterns across the fault trace, but also for their vertical spatial patterns near and at the fault trace itself. Radon-222 activities in the soil-gas were measured on-site with a radiation monitor and a Lucas cell. Radium-226 and Bi-214 were determined in soil samples in the laboratory by gamma-ray spectroscopy. A new technique employing the measurement of Rn-222 versus soil-depth shows a decrease in Rn-222 activity at the fault trace due to the much higher soil-gas permeability as a result of the fractured soil, as well as relative larger uranium-series disequilibria, in respect to an increase in Rn-222 activity at normal sites, where the soil is not fractured. Finally, it is suggested that fault trace detection could possibly also be performed by measuring Bi-214 in surface soils (0-100 cm) along a transect.

The encouraging biosorption of Am-241 from aqueous solutions by free Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) has been observed in our previous experiments. In this study, the Am-241 biosorption by immobilized S. cerevisiae and the effect of the various experimental conditions on the adsorption were investigated. The results indicated that the Am-241 biosorption by immobilized S. cerevisiae is still very efficient, and immobilized S. cerevisiae can be used repeatedly or continuously. The biosorption equilibrium was achieved within 2 hours, and more than 92% of Am-241 was removed by immobilized S. cerevisiae in the pH 1-4 range. No significant differences in Am-241 biosorption were observed at 15-45 degreesC. The immobilized S. cerevisiae, even after used repeatedly for 6 times, still could adsorb more than 90% of Am-241 in solutions of 1.08 MBq/l (8.5 mug/l). At this moment, the total adsorption capacity for Am-241 was more than 63.3 KBq/g globe (0.5 mug/g), but has not reached saturation yet. The Am-241 left in solutions with initial concentration of 1.08 MBq/l (8.5 mug/l) was noted as low as similar to10 Bq/l (similar to8.0X10(-5) mug/l) after adsorption by the immobilized S. cerevisiae for 3 times.

The runs were conducted in laboratory and bench scales using two systems of columns filled with Wofatit KPS ion exchange resin (medium porosity type). Ammonia NH4+/NH3 aq. was chosen as the isotopic exchange system. The ammonium bands formed in the columns were eluted by means of sodium hydroxide solution. Hydrodynamic patterns in the column beds was evaluated in terms of dimensionless Reynolds number. The results show that separation process can be performed in the turbulent or laminar flow regime.

The main source of systematic error in fission-track measurements of lambda(f) the so called "neutron dosimetry", has been avoided. Instead of calibrating the neutron source and the usual mica detector through tracks of U-235 fission induced by thermal neutrons, spontaneous-fission tracks and alpha-particle tracks of U-238 and Pu-242 were used. A value of lambda(f)= (8.66 +/- 0.38)(-17) y(-1) has been obtained.

It consists of a HPGe coaxial detector of 42% efficiency and 4 NaI(Tl) detectors. The energy output pulses of the Ge detector are delivered into the 3 spectrometry chains giving the normal, anti- and coincidence spectra. From the spectra of a number of Cs-137 and Co-60 sources a Compton suppression factor, SF and a Compton reduction factor, RF, as the parameters characterizing the system performance, were calculated as a function of energy and source activity and compared with those given in literature. The natural background is reduced about 8 times in the anticoincidence mode of operation, compared to the normal spectrum which results in decreasing the detection limits for non-coincident gamma-rays up to a factor of 3. In the presence of other gamma-ray activities, in the range from 5 to 11 kBq, non- and coincident, the detection limits can be decreased for some nuclides by a factor of 3 to 5.7.

J	Buchmann, JH; Sarkis, JES; Rodrigues, C				Buchmann, JH; Sarkis, JES; Rodrigues, C			Environmental monitoring used to identify nuclear signatures	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PLASMA-MASS SPECTROMETRY; FRUITING BODIES; ELEMENTS; POLLUTION; CADMIUM; COPPER; LEAD	The use of environmental monitoring as a technique to identify activities related to the nuclear fuel cycle has been proposed by international organizations as an additional measure to the safeguards agreements currently in force. The specific element for each kind of nuclear activity, or "nuclear signature", inserted into the ecosystem by several transfer paths, can be intercepted to a greater or lesser degree by different living organisms. This work demonstrates the technical viability of using pine needles as bioindicators for some nuclear signatures (Co, Ni, La, Ce, Sm, Th, and U) associated with uranium enrichment activities using high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HR-ICP-MS). The concentrations of the elements whose signatures were sought and were determined in pine needle samples collected at five specific sampling locations inside the area investigated demonstrate the potential of the instrument and of the method used to identify and quantify the sought signatures present in low quantities (traces) in the evaluated matrix.

The extraction of UO22+ and Th4+ by both open-chain crown ethers, L1 and L2 in chloroform as a diluent was studied at 25degreesC. Extraction distribution ratios (D) of UO22+ and Th4+ were investigated as a function of pH, lithium picrate concentration, and extractant concentration. Based on the experimental results, it was found that 1 : 1 complexes were formed involving either UO22+ or Th4+ with L1, and Th4+ with L2. The extractability of L1 for Th4+ is significantly higher than that for UO22+, the extractabilities of L1 and L2 for Th4+ being almost identical. L1 and L2 used here are not feasible for industry because of their relatively low extractabilities for Th4+ at pH<2.0 and for UO22+ at the extraction conditions used in this work.

J	Boice, JD; Mumma, M; Schweitzer, S; Blot, WJ				Boice, JD; Mumma, M; Schweitzer, S; Blot, WJ			Cancer mortality in a Texas county with prior uranium mining and milling activities, 1950-2001	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article							NUCLEAR-POWER-PLANTS; RADIUM DIAL WORKERS; LUNG-CANCER; RADIONUCLIDES; FACILITIES; RADIATION; TAILINGS; EXPOSURE; LEUKEMIA; VICINITY	Uranium was discovered in Karnes County, Texas, in 1954 and the first uranium mill began operating in 1961 near Falls City. Uranium milling and surface and in situ mining continued in Karnes County until the early 1990s. Remediation of uranium tailings ponds was completed in the 1990s. There were three mills and over 40 mines operating in Karnes County over these years and potential exposure to the population was from possible environmental releases into the air and ground water. From time to time concerns have been raised in Karnes County about potential increased cancer risk from these uranium mining and milling activities. To evaluate the possibility of increased cancer deaths associated with these uranium operations, a mortality survey was conducted. The numbers and rates of cancer deaths were determined for Karnes County and for comparison for four 'control' counties in the same region with similar age, race, urbanisation and socioeconomic distributions reported in the 1990 US Census. Comparisons were also made with US and Texas general population rates. Following similar methods to those used by the National Cancer Institute, standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were computed as the ratio of observed numbers of cancers in the study and control counties compared to the expected number derived from general population rates for the United States. Relative risks (RRs) were computed as the ratios of the SMRs for the study and the control counties. Overall, 1223 cancer deaths occurred in the population residing in Karnes County from 1950 to 2001 compared with 1392 expected based on general population rates for the US. There were 3857 cancer deaths in the four control counties during the same 52 year period compared with 4389 expected. There was no difference between the total cancer mortality rates in Karnes County and those in the control counties (RR = 1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.9-1.1). There were no significant increases in Karnes County for any cancer when comparisons were made with either the US population, the State of Texas or the control counties. In particular, deaths due to cancers of the lung, bone, liver and kidney were not more frequent in Karnes County than in the control counties. These are the cancers of a priori interest given that uranium might be expected to concentrate more in these tissues than in others. Further, any radium intake would deposit primarily in the bone and radon progeny primarily in the lung. Deaths from all cancers combined also were not increased in Karnes County and the RRs of cancer mortality in Karnes County before and in the early years of operations (1950-64), shortly after the uranium activities began (1965-79) and in two later time periods (198089, 1990-2001) were similar, 1.0, 0.9, 1.1 and 1.0, respectively. No unusual patterns of cancer mortality could be seen in Karnes County over a period of 50 years, suggesting that the uranium mining and milling operations had not increased cancer rates among residents.

J	Riley, P				Riley, P			Radiation risk in the context of liability for injury	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article								It is perceived by the man in the street that low-level radiation from a nuclear facility is more dangerous than that from other practices. The radiation protection system, in particular the ALARA principle, leads to concerns that even the smallest exposure to radiation is abnormal and dangerous. Public perception of the radiation risk leads to fear in the minds of the public. A consequence of this fear itself may be damage to health in the form of psychological damage or nervous shock. The paper draws attention to the liability for damages by radiation, in particular under the common law of the UK and US, and how liability, determined by the court, is not necessarily influenced by scientific rationality. A natural conclusion may be that a claimant suffering injury of the type caused by radiation and who had been exposed to radiation, no matter how small a dose, that could be shown to come from a nuclear installation would be awarded damages against the licensee of the site of the installation unless it could be shown that the injury was predominantly caused by another source (radioactive or otherwise).

J	Siddiqui, NA; Iqbal, MA; Abbas, H; Paul, DK				Siddiqui, NA; Iqbal, MA; Abbas, H; Paul, DK			Reliability analysis of nuclear containment without metallic liners against jet aircraft crash	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								The present study presents a methodology for detailed reliability analysis of nuclear containment without metallic liners against aircraft crash. For this purpose, a nonlinear limit state function has been derived using violation of tolerable crack width as failure criterion. This criterion has been considered as failure criterion because radioactive radiations may come out if size of crack becomes more than the tolerable crack width. The derived limit state uses the response of containment that has been obtained from a detailed dynamic analysis of nuclear containment under an impact of a large size Boeing jet aircraft. Using this response in conjunction with limit state function, the reliabilities and probabilities of failures are obtained at a number of vulnerable locations employing an efficient first-order reliability method (FORM). These values of reliability and probability of failure at various vulnerable locations are then used for the estimation of conditional and annual reliabilities of nuclear containment as a function of its location from the airport. To study the influence of the various random variables on containment reliability the sensitivity analysis has been performed. Some parametric studies have also been included to obtain the results of field and academic interest. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The average concentrations of ThO2 and UO2 are found to be 10.18 and 0.26 wt.%, respectively. The average rare-earth elements (REE) content is 56.75 wt.% and they are rich in La, Cc and Nd. The most characteristic feature common to all monazites is that the total REE content exceeds that of the actinides (U + Th), The chondrite-normalized REE distribution patterns of monazite grains shows uniformly enriched light rare-earth element, which could be due to the preferential incorporation of lighter lanthanides. These monazite sands are derived from the granulite facies of metamorphic rocks such as khondalites and charnockites from Eastern Ghats Group of rocks. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It focuses ion beams, from protons to uranium, with energies that are about 10 times larger than they are available at standard nuclear microprobes. Lateral resolutions of Deltax = 1.6 mum and Deltay = 1.2 mum for x- and y-direction at full aperture and as low as Deltax = 600 nm and Deltay = 150 nm for a pencil beam have been achieved so far. The latter values are limited by positional drifts and 50 Hz oscillating fields which have become obvious in time resolved measurements. SNAKE opens new possibilities for analysis of microstructured materials as well as materials modifications. The highlights are three dimensional hydrogen analysis using proton proton scattering, high resolution transmission energy loss measurements utilizing a magnetic spectrograph and materials modification with available high energy proton and heavy ion beams. Standard techniques like particle induced X-ray emission, elastic and inelastic scattering are also used for imaging.

It employs a low current, broad ion beam impinging on a sample, previously coated or simply covered with a few microns of a fast, highly efficient phosphor layer. The light produced at the single ion impact point is collected with an optical microscope and projected at high magnification onto a single photon position sensitive detector (PSD). This allows maps of the ion strike effects to be produced, effectively removing the need for a microbeam. Irradiation in air and even the use of alpha particle sources with no accelerator are possible. Potential applications include ion beam induced charge collection studies of semiconducting and insulating materials, single event upset studies on microchips and even biological cells in radiobiological effectiveness experiments. We describe the IPEM setup, including a 60x OM-40 microscope with a 1.5 mm hole for the beam transmission and a Quantar PSD with 60 mum pixel. Bicron plastic scintillator blades of 10 mum were chosen as a phosphor for their nanosecond time resolution, homogeneity, utility and commercial availability. The results given in this paper are for a prototype IPEM system. They indicate a resolution of similar to12 mum, the presence of a spatial halo and a He-ion efficiency of similar to20%. This marks the first time that nuclear microscopy has been performed with a radioactive source. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Disc of P. tinctorum, weighing approximate to9 mg was incubated in 25 ml 0.1 M NaCl solutions containing 1 mM Co for up to 96 h. Concentrations of Co in the solutions were measured at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h by ICP-AES. Spatial distribution of Co, K, P and Fe in the cross-section of P. tinctorum was examined by in-air mu-PIXE (particle induced X-ray emission) technique developed in the TIARA facility of JAERI. Sorption of Co by P. tinctorum reached equilibrium within 24 h. Co uptake was averaged to be 27 dry wt.%, and was independent of solution pHs between 3 and 5. Two-dimensional distribution of Co indicates that the sorbed Co was localized, and the density of Co in the lichen was ordered lower surface > upper surface, medullary layer > algal layer. Highest density in the two-dimensional distribution of Co is obtained in the lower surface suggesting that Co was sorbed by melanin-like pigment contained in the lower surface. Two-dimensional distribution of Co did not correspond to Fe indicating that Co was not adsorbed on the Fe-containing minerals trapped on P. tinctorum. It is concluded that mu-PIXE analysis is a useful technique to detect the distribution of low concentration of elements in lichen biomass. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We investigated the micro-chemical distribution of trace elements in speleothems formed of an unusual mixture of calcite and aragonite, originating from the Aranzadi gallery, 'Gouffre de La Pierre-Saint-Martin', Pyrenees, France. PIXE and RBS were performed simultaneously with a 3.0 MeV proton beam, focused down to 5.0 mum diameter. Quantitative element mapping revealed that U and Sr concentrations were the highest ever observed in speleothems of meteoric origin. Moreover, within the same samples, Sr and U were more concentrated by a factor 10 in aragonite mineral phase than in calcite. This can be explained by the crystalline orthorhombic structure of aragonite that presents a site of coordination wider than in calcite allowing to trap large cations such as Sr2+ and (UO2)(2+). These results helped to raise new hypothesis on the very specific growth conditions of some speleothems from the Aranzadi gallery. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The method applied follows the technique of chemical dating of U-Th minerals: assuming that the monazite crystal is a closed system and all Pb within grain is radiogenic, it is possible to determine the age of a specimen by solving an equilibrium equation which includes as computational factors the elemental contents of U, Th and Pb and decay times of uranium and thorium. Using this approach, thanks to rather fast Pb accumulation in a crystal, monazite older than 100 My may be dated with relative ease. The investigated specimens were clusters of crystals, 30-100 mum in size, polished and mounted in Epoxy resin. Due to different geological history, the age of individual crystals from one sample may differ significantly, therefore the application of a microprobe has been necessary to extract information concerning single monazite grains. Two age groups were identified: small cluster, connected with Cadomian tectonothermal event (579 +/- 30 My) and dominating cluster, connected with Variscan tectonothermal event (329 +/- 19 My, 353 +/- 41 My). After successful preliminary measurements carried out in a provisory experimental chamber, an optimized chamber was constructed and set into operation for regular studies. Together with results of these investigations, the constructional details of the new chamber are presented. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The experimental method is based on the observation of the He-3(d, p)alpha reaction. The detection of the high energy proton (12-14 MeV) is convenient for large implantation depths (5 mum < x < 10 mum) and limits the depth resolution around 100-150 nm. After controlled temperature annealing, the thermal diffusion coefficient can be deduced from the broadening of the helium-3 depth profile according to a classical Fick's law formalism by comparing several computing codes. Several examples concerning simple oxides (UO2 and ZrO2) and more complex ceramics considered as potential nuclear waste forms (britholite and zirconolite) are given. Typical thermal diffusion coefficients obtained for britholite, zirconolite, zirconia and uranium dioxide are in the range 10(-14)-10(-12) cm(2) s(-1) between 300 and 1000 degreesC.

Divalent Cd ions were found to be selectively taken up by the apatite from the mixture even though it has one order of magnitude lower distribution coefficient for Cd2+ than Na-4-mica. This was mainly attributed to the fact that the kinetics of uptake by the apatite were more rapid than those by Na-4-mica. Regarding the uptake of Cd colloids containing hydroxides and carbonates, no clear selectivity for solid phases was observed and Cd colloids appeared to be preferentially taken up by smaller particles of solid phases.

Blackish areas containing stick and circular precipitates appear when the irradiation temperature increases. Proton induced scattering experiments (muRBS and PESA) coupled with muPIXE simultaneous measurements have been conducted to characterize elemental distributions in the near surface region of glasses after their irradiation. Particularly, the (12)C(p, p)(12)C resonant scattering was exploited for carbon analysis. A strong carbon surface enrichment is found in these blackish areas correlated with the occurrence of a layered structure and possible migration of mobile glass components like Na and Ca. The carbon enrichment effect is attributed to the migration of carbon assisted by beta-irradiation. The presence of carbon results from the laboratory glass synthesis process during which the outgasing of carbon dioxide from carbonate basic compounds (Na(2)CO(3)) has not been completely achieved.

These data are available for validation of computer codes and nuclear data used for criticality safety analyses of LEU solution systems. The. calculated k(eff)'s for the water-reflected STACY criticality experiments have been overestimated with JENDL-3.2 by similar to0.7%. These overestimations were kept in mind while making modiflcations of the fission spectrum and the fission cross section of U-235, and the (n, p) cross section of N-14 in JENDL-3.3. Because of these modifications, the k(eff)'s calculated with JENDL-3.3 were largely improved. The contributions of these modifications in JENDL-3.3 with respect to JENDL-3.2 and ENDF/B- VI.5 were investigated by performing perturbation calculations. The overestimation of the elastic-scattering cross section of Fe-56 in the mega-electron-volt range was one of the reasons for the k(eff) overestimations for the STACY experiments with JENDL-3.2. The modification of 56Fe cross sections in JENDL-3.3 reduces k(eff)'s in the STACY experiments by 0.2%. The dependence of calculated k(eff)'s on uranium concentration still exists in JENDL-3.3. The overestimation of calculated k(eff)'s for the STACY experiments with JENDL-3.3 is not insignificant and is as much as 0.6%. These problems are to be resolved in a future evaluation of the cross-section library.

This experiment and its evaluation are given as examples of benchmark experiments at research reactors. For this reason the differences and possible problems compared to other benchmark experiments are particularly emphasized. General guidelines for performing criticality benchmarks in research reactors are given. The criticality benchmark experiment was performed in a normal operating reactor core using commercially available fresh 20% enriched fuel elements containing 12 wt% uranium in uranium-zirconium hydride fuel material. Experimental conditions to minimize experimental errors and to enhance computer modeling accuracy are described. Uncertainties in multiplication factor due to fuel composition and geometry data are analyzed by sensitivity analysis. The simplifications in the benchmark model compared to the actual geometry are evaluated. Sample benchmark calculations with the MCNP and KENO Monte Carlo codes are given.

J	Zurron, S; Sanchez, G; Alvaro, C				Zurron, S; Sanchez, G; Alvaro, C			Use of international Criticality Safety Benchmark Evaluation Project benchmarks for the validation of CSAS26 (Scale 4.4a) for configurations of low-enriched uranium	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article								As an example of the application of the International Criticality Safety Benchmark Evaluation Project (ICSBEP) work to the nuclear industry, the validation of the control module CSAS26 of SCALE 4.4a for criticality calculations on a personal computer platform is presented. This work has been done using the models of critical experiments being compiled by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development/Nuclear Energy Agency (OECD/NEA) since 1992. The description and results of this compilation were first presented during the Fifth International Conference on Nuclear Criticality Safety (ICNC'95). Out of 2881 critical configurations included in the latest edition (September 2002) of the ICSBEP "International Handbook of Evaluated Criticality Safety Benchmark Experiments," NEA/NSC/ DOC(95)03, OECD/NEA, 131 have been selected for the CSAS26 validation. The selected critical experiments have characteristics similar to the systems to be simulated with CSAS26 for low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel fabrication applications. They represent both homogeneous configurations, and hexagonally pitched rod lattices of low-enriched (from 1.60 to 5.00 wt% U-235) UO2 with several absorbers. The statistical uncertainties related to the application of CSAS26 for criticality calculations are also evaluated. The great number of cases involved allows an exhaustive statistical treatment of the. data, including the analysis of correlations related to the type of system being simulated. The statistical uncertainties found are very small. As a result, the module CSAS26 is considered as a quite suitable calculational method for application to criticality safety analysis at LEU facilities.

In this methodology, both the required enrichment and the fuel performance limits are considered. In order to select the best fuel candidate, the optimal burnup that produces the lowest annual fuel cost within the burnup potential for a given fuel material and smear density ratio is determined. Several nuclear materials are presented as examples of the application of the methodology proposed in this paper. The alternative fuels considered include uranium dioxide (UO2), uranium carbide (UC) uranium nitride (UN), metallic uranium (U-Zr alloy), combined thorium and uranium oxides (ThO2/UO2), and combined thorium and uranium metals (U/Th). For these examples, a typical LWR lattice geometry in a zirconium-based cladding was assumed. The uncertainties in the results presented are large due to the scarcity of experimental data regarding the behavior of the considered materials at high burnups. Also, chemical compatibility issues are to be considered separately. The same methodology can be applied in the future to evaluate the economic potential of other nuclear fuel materials including different cladding designs, dispersions of ceramics into ceramics, dispersions of ceramics into metals, and also for geometries other than the traditional circular fuel pin.

This concerns primarily plutonium and minor actinides (neptunium, americium, and curium), accumulated in the spent fuel of nuclear reactors. One of the ways this can be solved is to use a fast reactor with uranium-free fuel. The physics of this type of reactor was widely investigated during the last year for the BN-800 reactor. The solutions of the most important problems were (a) a decrease in nonuniformity of the power distribution and (b) an increase of the Doppler effect. The next stage of such core investigations is an evaluation of self-protection to beyond-design accidents. Preliminary results show a high safety level of the BN-800 reactor with uranium-free fuel in unprotected loss-of-flow and unprotected transient overpower events.

In the long term, critical accumulations of fissile material can be formed only by mobilization of uranium and plutonium from the waste forms and subsequent precipitation or sorption of these elements. This paper presents an overview of mechanisms relevant for mobilization and possible accumulation of U and Pu from disposed mixed-oxide fuel elements. Concentrations of fissile materials observed in laboratory corrosion experiments together with model approaches are applied to determine the degree of fissile material accumulation and the risk of a sustained nuclear chain reaction. A prerequisite of criticality in a repository is an accumulation of fissile materials. Since geometry, moderation, and neutron absorption properties cannot be forecast, the neutron multiplication factor k(inf) is used (instead of k(eff)) as a measure of the incidence of criticality. The factor k(inf) is derived for several scenarios. Required critical masses and critical volumes are evaluated. The accumulation of Pu onto solids is considered, and it is shown how selective enrichment of Pu and U may affect the risk of criticality. It is also shown that the criterion for criticality would be met only in the unrealistic case of selective sorption of Pu-239. Realistic sorption densities are too low to provide sufficient accumulation of fissile materials for criticality. This is particularly true if high Cl concentrations are present.

The equation describing the transport of the radionuclide released from the geological repository includes the following mechanisms: advection, dispersion, radioactive decay, and adsorption on the fracture surfaces. The concentration at the inlet of each fracture is assumed constant. An analytical solution was derived based on such a mathematical model by the Laplace transform technique. The solution indicates that identical concentration distributions can be observed in each fracture of the equal-width parallel fractured system. In an unequal-width fractured system, the penetration distances along wide fractures are generally larger than that in a single uniform fractured system. The radionuclide concentration in the wide fracture quickly reaches source concentration in the near-field environment, confirming that the fracture width plays an important role in radionuclide transport through a system of multiple and parallel fractured media.

J	Manaka, M				Manaka, M			The effective diffusion coefficient of dissolved oxygen and oxidation rate of pyrite by dissolved oxygen in compacted purified and crude sodium bentonites in carbonate buffered solution	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						dissolved oxygen diffusion; pyrite oxidation; crude sodium bentonite		Immediately after the geological disposal of high-level radioactive waste, the oxygen initially existing in the repository is expected to strongly affect the redox condition of the near field. The oxygen dissolves in the groundwater, is transported by diffusion through it, and is consumed by the oxidation of pyrite as an impurity in bentonite. To assess the influence of the oxygen, this study was conducted to estimate the diffusion of dissolved oxygen (DO) and the rate of pyrite oxidation by DO in compacted purified and crude sodium bentonites (SBs) in more detail than the Manaka et A study. The effective diffusion coefficient (De) of DO in the compacted purified SB was measured in low ionic strength solution (carbonate buffered solution with pHsimilar to9) using the electrochemical method. The empirical equation between De value of DO and dry density (0.5x10(3)-1.8x10(3) kg m(-3)) of purified SB was obtained as follows: De(Kunipia-F)(DO)=8.2+/-1.5x10(-10) x exp (-2.6+/-0.2x10-3 rho), where De(Kunipia-F)(DO) is the De of DO in compacted purified SB (Kunipia F) (m(2) s(-1)) and rho is the dry density of the SB (kg m(-3)). On the other hand, the De value of DO in the compacted crude SB was estimated using the relationship between De values of tritiated water in compacted purified and crude SBs. The empirical equation between the De value of DO and dry density (0.5x10(3)-1.8x10(3) kg m(-3)) of crude SB was derived as follows: De(Kunigel-V1)(DO)=2.04x10(-9) exo (-2.6x10(-3) rho), where De(Kunigel-V1)(DO) is the De of DO in compacted crude SB (Kunigel V1) (m(2) s(-1)) and rho is the dry density of the SB (kg m(-3)). The rates of pyrite oxidation by DO were estimated from the experimental data in pyrite-purified SB systems using the obtained De values of DO. The relation between rate constant (k') of pyrite oxidation by DO and dry density (rho) of the SB was derived as follows: k'=3.9+/-1.1x10(-8) exo(-1.3+/-0.3x10(-3) rho), where k' is the rate constant at pHsimilar to9 in compacted purified SB of dry density ranging from 0.8x10(3) to 1.2x10(3) kg m(-3). The rate constants of pyrite oxidation by DO in the compacted crude SB (0.8x10(3) to 1.2x10(3) kg m(-3)) were also calculated using the estimated De values of DO. In general, the values of rate constants in the crude SB are 1.5 times as large as that in the purified SB.

Fleischer, P.B. Price and R.M. Walker in the early 1960s of the last century is an interesting and potentially useful concept with something to offer to almost all branches of science and technology. In fact nuclear tracks find applications wherever solid state damage occurs, Apart from the direct applications of far reaching consequences in nuclear physics, other areas as diverse as bio-medical sciences, cosmic rays and space physics, environmental research, geological sciences, material science, microanalysis, mine safety, nuclear technology, uranium prospecting, etc. have been greatly influenced by SSNTDs. In this presentation, we attempt to provide an overview of the growth of nuclear tracks research in India over the last four decades and the contributions of various groups from Universities, Institutes, Nuclear Track Society of India and the Department of Atomic Energy in nurturing nuclear track research in the country. Finally, a summary of the Significant contributions made by Indian scientists is also presented in this paper along with the overall impact it has made at the national and international level in many areas of basic and applied sciences such as cosmic rays and space physics, fusion-fission and particle evaporation, heavy ion ranges and energy-loss measurements, country-wide indoor radon-thoron survey, geochronology, environmental sciences, track-etch membranes and ion tracks technology, material science, physics and chemistry of fission, etc. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The methodology of the new detectors is introduced. The preliminary results show a measurable response of the gel material detectors to radon gas. The measurements are compared with those using NTDs CR-39 type for calibration purposes. Both the detection systems, the passive close-end cup system with NTDs and the passive close-end cup gel material detector, were exposed at the same time in the radon calibration chamber to different radon exposition levels from 150 to 3000 Bq/m(-3).

These neutrons can be used to drive a sub-critical nuclear assembly for energy generation and/or for the transmutation of the long-lived nuclear waste isotopes to environmentally safer nuclear species. Such nuclear assemblies are referred to as accelerator driven systems (ADS). Knowledge of the neutron yield in the spallation process and an understanding of the behaviour of these neutrons in the desired sub-critical assembly are the most important and determining factors in the design and operation of these systems. Many parameters related to the neutronics of an ADS can be studied qualitatively as well as quantitatively using solid-state nuclear track detectors (SSNTD). In some circumstances SSNTDs provide the best and the most logical detector option for these investigations. In this paper applications of the SSNTDs into research related to ADS are discussed and some experimental and theoretical results presented. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is based on: (a) the ability of non-conducting crystals to register and to store for many million years the tracks due to fast nuclei with atomic number Z greater than or equal to 20 ("fossil" tracks); (b) calibrations of the said crystals with accelerated heavy ions (20 less than or equal to Z less than or equal to 92) and on revealing the volume etchable track length (VETL) of the fast nuclei coining to rest inside crystals both of fossil and "fresh" tracks-to determine the charge distribution of cosmic-ray nuclei tracks and (c) the so-called "four-zone" model of tracks in crystals (and also glasses) which provides not only the VETL track length dependence for 20 less than or equal to Z less than or equal to 92 nuclei but also demonstrates the regular annealing behavior of VETL of 20 less than or equal to Z less than or equal to 92 nuclei in a broad temperature interval. This approach was first applied in the early 1980s to investigate the "fossil" tracks due to 22 less than or equal to Z less than or equal to 92 cosmic-ray nuclei in olivine crystals from meteorites-pallasite Marjalahti and Eagle Station. The discovery of Th-U cosmic-ray nuclei tracks in 1980 was unambiguously confirmed by calibrations of the same crystals With U-238, Au-197 and Pb-208 accelerated ions in the late 1980s. More than 1600 tracks due to cosmic-ray actinide nuclei were measured during the last two decades of the 20th century. Also, I I anomalously long tracks (track length exceeds by a factor (1.6 +/- 0.1) the track length due to Th-U nuclei were measured. The detailed analysis shows that at least 5 of these tracks could not be attributed to the Th-U nuclei. It means that now we have a preliminary proof on the existence Z greater than or equal to 110 nuclei in cosmic-rays. The abundance is Z greater than or equal to 110/Th-U=(1-3) x 10(-3) in Z greater than or equal to 110 freshly formed cosmic-rays (time interval 10(3)-10(7) years). The method proposed can provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for the discovery of Z greater than or equal to 110 nuclei in nature. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Experimental work showing that the damaged crystal lattice along a fission track recovers primarily as a function of temperature ignored the fact that the basic theory of atomic diffusion requires an exponential decrease in the intrinsic diffusion coefficient with increasing pressure. Here, fission track recovery was experimentally investigated in basic apatite under the simultaneous influences of temperature, pressure and stress. We show that track facing is a complex recovery mechanism responding to several environmental physical parameters simultaneously. In particular a strong decrease in the track recovery rate was observed as a function of increasing pressure. And a nearly temperature-independent recovery was observed in samples Under stress.

The fission-track method has not attained the status of an independent dating method because of problems related to neutron fluence measurements and the decay constant. Fission-track ages are instead determined relative to the reference ages of standards using an empirical calibration factor (zeta-method). Methodical advances during the last decade imply that these problems need not remain obstacles to establishing fission-track dating as an independent method. However, sources of systematic error related to the track density measurements need to be corrected before this can be the case. A correction factor (GQR), determined by experiment, is in good agreement with its calculated value. The ages of apatites of known age determined with the phi-method are also in good agreement with their reference ages. When applied to a set of samples of unknown age, the phi-method produces results that are consistent with those obtained with the Z- and zeta-methods. These results lend support to the method of neutron fluence measurement, to the recommended value of the decay constant and to the calculated and measured GQR-value. On the other hand, these results call into question the validity of age corrections based on confined track length measurements. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
