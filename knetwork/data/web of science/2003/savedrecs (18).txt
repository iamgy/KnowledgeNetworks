Several steps can be taken to mitigate the effect of the plasma interaction with the divertor target, one of the most effective is plasma detachment. In MAST (Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak) a series of experiments were conducted which aimed to achieve detachment for the first time on a spherical tokamak with rather open divertor geometry. This paper presents the results of these experiments, concentrating on a series of L-mode discharges, additionally heated with 750 kW of NB injection, for which the degree of detachment [Nucl. Fusion 38 (1998) 331] is calculated and discussed. Evidence for deuterium volume recombination in the lower outer divertor is shown and used to estimate with greater accuracy T, (overestimated by the Langmuir probes for detached plasmas) in the divertor region.

As previous investigations have shown [1], the measurement of the molecular flux is essential for an accurate determination of the total deuterium flux released from carbon plasma-facing components. Experiments have been carried out to ascertain the number of deuterium molecules released from a test limiter in the plasma edge of TEXTOR. For different plasma conditions, a molecular flux up to Gamma(M) similar or equal to 5 x 10(20) s(-1) was measured. Fulcher-alpha-band spectroscopy is introduced as a straightforward method for the determination of Gamma(M). We describe photon flux measurements, a comparison with Eirene calculations, and finally the determination of recycling particle fluxes. The conversion factor D/XB taken from a collisional-radiative model (CRMOL) and relating the number of molecular losses per photon was verified in gas injection experiments.

After the first six He fueled change-over discharges, only He plasma operation was performed. Following this investigation, the situation is reversed and the change-over from an initially saturated He wall is investigated when only D-2 plasma fuelling is used. The He concentration is measured in the subdivertor with a species selective Penning gauge. Comparison of the time dependence of the divertor concentrations with those at the edge and strike point shows significant differences during the first six discharges. This difference along with a global He particle balance is used to assess the status of the wall saturation over the initial 6-7 He change-over discharges. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The measured CIII emission profiles indicate transient inner leg attachment with the arrival of the ELM heat pulse. The measured D-alpha emission profiles during an ELM cycle show enhanced deuterium recycling during the deposition of the ELM particle pulse at the target, which suggests the detachment of the divertor plasma from the target plates. Measurements taken in ELMy H-mode discharges at densities of 50% and 90% of the Greenwald density limit are compared utilising the CID camera system and a comprehensive set of other divertor diagnostics. An ELM models based on fluid and PIC simulations are used to discuss the observation on the response of the divertor plasma to the ELM heat and particle pulse. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

L-mode plasmas in JET. The radiation intensities from C1+, C2+ and C3+ in the helium plasmas showed reduction by factors of 8, 10 and 25, respectively along the inner SOL and divertor leg compared with the deuterium cases. However, the emission in the outer divertor leg was less than a factor of 2 lower in helium. Using photon efficiencies calculated by the UEDGE code for the spectrometer lines of sight, the calculated source rates of C1+ and C3+ along the inner SOL and inner divertor were reduced by factors of 4 and 20, respectively in the helium plasmas. In the outer divertor leg the source rate of C3+ was reduced by a factor of 10 but the C1+ source rate did not change in helium. These measurements are consistent with a model that chemical sputtering of carbon dominates the source from the inner wall and inner divertor in deuterium L-mode plasmas while physical sputtering appears to dominate the source from the outer divertor.

The b2-Eirene code (solps4), used for DIII-D geometry, suggests that a complex sequence can occur during an ELM cycle in which a transiently detached phase, with relatively low enrichment, can occur even under nominally attached conditions. A slower recovery phase then follows, in which the effect of induced scrape-off layer flows can increase in importance. The model results are compared with available fast time-scale measurements. The observed increased enrichment with higher Z is similar to trends in basic particle reflection properties. Neon recycling processes may thus introduce a significant history effect, as illustrated by analysis of continuous, unforced neon accumulation in a DIII-D discharge with a well-characterized operational history.

Both the particle flux and the power deposition are shown to be non-uniform when the plasma is attached while a uniform deposition is obtained when it is detached. A degree of detachment (DoD) is proposed, based on IR measurements using the ratio of the heat flux deposition from a 'hot' and a 'cold' area. This infrared degree of detachment (IR_DoD) is larger than 1 in the attached phase and decreases towards 1 when the plasma approaches detachment. A comparison between the classical DoD deduced from Langmuir probes and the IR_DoD deduced for IR data is given, showing a similar sensitivity when the density increases. Finally, since the IR_DoD does not require any modification of the IR system, it is an opportunity to optimize the ratio by a careful selection of the viewed area, free from major drifts and calibrations of the measurement system.

J	Baik, MH; Hyun, SP; Hahn, PS				Baik, MH; Hyun, SP; Hahn, PS			Surface and bulk sorption of uranium(VI) onto granite rock	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							FRACTURED MEDIA; SORBING SOLUTES; TRANSPORT; MINERALS; RADIUM	Surface and bulk sorption of U(VI) onto granite rock with different types of surfaces were carried out and the results were compared for the different surfaces such as crushed granite, machined core granite, and core granite with fractured surface. The sorption behavior of U(VI) dependent on surface types was investigated and discussed for contacting time, pH, constituent minerals, and surface area. Results from the sorption experiments were also compared each other in order to analyze the differences in sorption behaviors of U(VI) and to correlate the surface sorption coefficient K-alpha and the bulk sorption coefficient K-d. The effect of contact time and pH on the sorption of U(VI) onto fractured surfaces was larger than that onto the machined fresh surfaces but smaller than that onto the crushed surfaces. As expected, it was noticed that the surface sorption coefficients of U(VI) for the natural fracture surfaces were greater than those of the machined fresh surfaces due to the higher content of secondary minerals such as calcite and chlorite which acted as stronger sorbents. It is presumed that there are many micro-fractures or micro-pores available for the uranium sorption on the granite surfaces, even on the machined fresh surfaces, and there can be an intrinsic difference between the surface and the bulk sorption due to the different types of surfaces.

From the identification of SEM-EDAX analysis, an experimental result of silver ion-exchanged ratio containing 10similar to30 wt% of Ag was fit to that calculated by the weight increment, and it was confirmed that the silver was uniformly distributed inside the pores of the adsorbent. Demonstration test of AgX-10 adsorbent using radioactive methyl iodide tracer was performed. The removal efficiency of radioiodine with AgX-10 in the temperature ranges of 150 to 300 degreesC was in the ranges of 99.9% to 99.99%, except for 300 degreesC. The influence of the long-term weathering and the poisoning with NO2 gas (200 ppm) on adsorption capacity of AgX-10 was also analyzed. The removal efficiency of radioactive methyl iodide by AgX-10 weathered for 14 weeks was 99.95%. Long-term poisoning test showed that the adsorption efficiency of methyl iodide started to decrease after 10 weeks, and the removal efficiency of radioiodine by AgX-10, poisoned for 16 weeks, was 99% (DF=100).

The procedure, which is based on anion exchange chromatography, separates Pd from a large amount of target material (16 g Ag), as well as Rh radioisotopes (mainly Rh-101 and Rh-100), which are produced from decays of their Pd parents. The AG MP-1 anion exchange resin was used for the process. For elution of Rh and Ag, 3M nitric acid solution was used and 5% ammonia solution was used to elute the Pd. The average recovery of Pd was 97.4%. An elution curve for Pd was set up and a panel for the radiochemistry designed and installed in a hot cell.

Possible polyatomic interferences were studied and their effects on Ra-226 measurements were determined. The instrumental conditions for optimal signal-to-noise ratio for Ra-226 were found. Concentrations of Ra-226 in certified reference samples were measured using both external calibration and standard addition approaches. The best precision was obtained by applying standard additions. The absolute detection limit for Ra-226 was 1 fg with optimal gas flow rates for the collision cell of 7 ml.min(-1) for helium and 4 ml.min(-1) for hydrogen.

The use of radioactive label on closo-dodecaborate might facilitate pharmacokinetic studies. The use of nucleophilic reactions might be of advantage if derivatives of closo-dodecaborate were oxidation sensitive. The aim of this study was to estimate the feasibility of isotopic exchange in radioiodide - iodo-undecahydro-closo-dodecaborate system. We demonstrated that copper-catalyzed isotope exchange in this system in molten acetamide provides a labeling yield of 78.4+/-1.1% after 30 minutes at 170 degreesC.

As a case study, filter samples from the large area of Thessaloniki, Greece, were used. For the uranium determination instrumental neutron activation analysis was used. To obtain equal counting conditions for all samples after irradiation, independent from the initial matrix, uranium was leached from the filter by using a 0.1M NH4HCO3 solution, forming a stable uranyl complex [UO2(CO3)(3)]. This complex was absorbed in a batch process on a small amount of chelating ion exchanger Srafion NMRR, which was directly irradiated in the reactor of the NCSR Demokritos. The study showed that over the investigated time period in 1997 the mean concentration was found to be 0.047 ng U/m(3). In relation to the collected amount of airborne particulates having a mean concentration of 0.52 mug/gU. It can be assumed as a natural uranium level in the environment.

Two different adsorbents were used including char and activated carbon produced from used tires. The surface area was larger on activated carbon. Adsorption experiments were carried out as a function of time, adsorbent concentration, pH and initial concentration of uranium. The adsorption kinetics was found to follow the Lagergren equation. The rate constants of intraparticle diffusion and mass transfer coefficients were calculated. It was shown that the equilibrium data could be fitted by the Langmuir and Freundlich equations. The adsorption of uranium in the presence of diffferent cations were also studied and the results were correlated with the ionic potential of the cations. Results obtained in the study demonstrate that the activated carbon produced from used tires can be considered as an adsorbent that has a commercial potential for uranium removal.

The influence of certain variables such as extractant concentration, acidity, equilibrium time as well as UO22+ ions on the extraction of thorium has been investigated systematically. The back-extraction behavior of thorium from the organic phase has also been tested. The results reveal that the percent extraction of 234Th decreases with increasing hydrochloric acid concentration and thorium is easily back-extracted with an 4-6 mol/l aqueous HCl solution. At the same time, the effect of thorium extraction with PMBP was tested employing radioisotopes as multi-tracers in the irradiation of natural uranium with 14-15 MeV neutrons. The results show that thorium can be completely separated from a large amount of uranium and most of the other main reaction products.

Three main categories of NORM waste were identified. First, hard scales from decontamination of contaminated equipment and tubings which are considered to contain the highest levels of radium isotopes (Ra-226, Ra-228, Ra-224); this type of waste being currently stored in standard barrels in a controlled area. Second, sludge wastes containing low levels of radium isotopes were found in large amounts in each Syrian oilfield; plastic lined disposal pits were constructed in each area for temporary storage. However, disposal criteria for the above two categories of NORM waste are still under discussions. Third, soil contaminated with NORM as a result of uncontrolled disposal of production water was also considered as NORM waste. The Syrian criteria for disposal and clean up of this type of waste has been defined and approved by the Regulatory Office.

This can be done by measuring the concentrations of a dissolved element (for example Ca2+), provided that no chemical precipitations have occurred in mixture waters. In this later case, the determination of flow rate is however possible by isotopic geochemistry, by knowing isotopic ratios of an element, for ex. U-234/U-238, in each river considered and the ratio of the concentrations in dissolved U-238 in two of them. A study of the Var and its tributary the Vesubie is performed: in January 31st, 2001, the flow rate D-3, downstream the confluence was 35 m(3)/s. The ratio of the U-238 concentrations in the Vesubie river and in the Var upstream (U-238(1)/U-238(2)) was 5.5. The isotopic ratios U-234/U-238 measured in the Var, downstream the confluence were R-3 = 1.51, upstream R-2 = 1.75, and in the Vesubie R-1 = 1.08. We have calculated the Vesubie flow rate as D-1 = 3.2 m(3)/s.

The separation was carried out from ascorbic acid medium. The adsorption of thorium(IV) was quantitative from 0.001-0.01M ascorbic acid. The elution of thorium(IV) was quantitative with 4.0-8.0M HCl, 3.0-6.0M HClO4, 4.0-8.0M H2SO4 and 1.0-8.0M HBr. The capacity of poly-(dibenzo-18-crown-6) for thorium(IV) was found to be 1.379+/-0.01 m.mol/g of crown polymer. Thorium(IV) was separated from a number of cations in binary as well as in multicomponent mixtures. The method was extended to the determination of thorium in monazite sand. It is possible to separate and determine 5 ppm of thorium(IV) by this method. The method is very simple, rapid, selective and has good reproducibility (approximately +/-2%).

J	Charles, MW; Mill, AJ; Darley, PJ				Charles, MW; Mill, AJ; Darley, PJ			Carcinogenic risk of hot-particle exposures	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Review							ENHANCED NEOPLASTIC TRANSFORMATION; INHOMOGENEOUS RADIATION-FIELD; PROJECT PLUTONIUM WORKERS; HEAVILY DAMAGED CELLS; LUNG-CANCER; TUMOR-INDUCTION; FOLLOW-UP; IONIZING-RADIATION; ALPHA-PARTICLES; MAYAK WORKERS	It has been suggested that spatially non-uniform radiation exposures, such as those from small radioactive particles ('hot particles'), may be very much more carcinogenic than when the same amount of energy is deposited uniformly throughout a tissue volume. This review provides a brief summary of in vivo and in vitro experimental findings, and human epidemiology data, which can be used to evaluate the veracity of this suggestion. Overall, this supports the contrary view and indicates that average dose, as advocated by the ICRP, is likely to provide a reasonable estimate of carcinogenic risk (within a factor of similar to+/-3). There are few human data with which to address this issue. The limited data on lung cancer mortality following occupational inhalation of plutonium aerosols, and the incidence of liver cancer and leukaemia due to thorotrast administration for clinical diagnosis, do not appear to support a significant enhancement factor. Very few animal studies, including mainly lung and skin exposures, provide any indication of a hot-particle enhancement for carcinogenicity. Some recent in vitro malignant transformation experiments provide evidence for an enhanced cell transformation for hot-particle exposures but, properly interpreted, the effect is modest.

J	Thorne, MC				Thorne, MC			Background radiation: natural and man-made	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Review							FOSSIL-FUEL CO2; NEUTRALIZATION; FALLOUT	A brief overview and comparison is given of dose rates arising from natural background radiation and the fallout from atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons. Although there are considerable spatial variations in exposure to natural background radiation, it is useful to give estimates of worldwide average overall exposures from the various components of that background. Cosmic-ray secondaries of low linear energy transfer (LET), mainly muons and photons, deliver about 280 muSv a(-1). Cosmic-ray neutrons deliver about another 100 muSv a(-1). These low- and high-LET exposures are relatively uniform to the whole body. The effective dose rate from cosmogenic radionuclides is dominated by the contribution of 12 muSv a(-1) from C-14. This is due to relatively uniform irradiation of all organs and tissues from low-energy beta particles. Primordial radionuclides and their progeny (principally the (238)u and Th-232 series, and K-40) contribute about 480 muSv a(-1) of effective dose by external irradiation. This is relatively uniform photon irradiation of the whole body. Internally incorporated 40K contributes a further 165 muSv a(-1) of effective dose in adults, mainly from beta particles, but with a significant gamma component. Equivalent doses from 40K are somewhat higher in muscle than other soft tissues, but the distinction is less than a factor of three. Uranium and thorium series radionuclides give rise to an average effective dose rate of around 120 muSv a(-1). This includes a major alpha particle component, and exposures of radiosensitive tissues in lung, liver, kidney and the skeleton are recognised as important contributors to effective dose. Overall, these various sources give a worldwide average effective dose rate of about 1160 muSv a(-1). Exposure to Rn-222, Rn-220 and their short-lived progeny has to be considered separately. This is very variable both within and between countries. For Rn-222 and its progeny, a worldwide average effective dose rate is about 1105 muSv a(-1). For Rn-220 and its progeny, the corresponding value is 91 muSv a(-1). In both cases, the effective dose is mainly due to a particle irradiation of the bronchial tissues of the lungs. Overall, the worldwide average effective dose rate from natural background is about 2400 muSv a(-1) or 2.4 mSv a(-1). For comparison, worldwide average effective dose rates from weapons fallout peaked at 113 muSv a(-1) (about 5% of natural background) in 1963 and have since fallen to about 5.5 muSv a(-1) (about 0.2% of natural background). These values perhaps serve to emphasise that even gross insults to the natural environment from anthropogenic releases of radioactive materials are likely to be of limited significance when set in the context of the ambient radioactive environment within which all organisms, including humans, have developed.

J	Ogundare, FO				Ogundare, FO			Review of the radioactive waste management system in Nigeria	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Review								The management of radioactive waste in Nigeria from early 1960 to date is reviewed. As in many developing countries, waste management in Nigeria has been shown to be ineffective. The factors that are responsible for this ineffectiveness are identified and discussed. The steps being taken by and the opportunities available to the newly established Nigerian Nuclear Regulatory Authority towards addressing this problem of ineffectiveness are discussed. The efforts of this newly set up body towards managing the resultant radioactive wastes that will be generated during the use of a reactor and an accelerator that will soon be commissioned in Nigeria are also mentioned. Likely ways of further addressing the problems militating against waste management in developing countries are suggested.

J	Whitby, M; Martin, CJ				Whitby, M; Martin, CJ			Investigation using an advanced extremity gamma instrumentation system of options for shielding the hand during the preparation and injection of radiopharmaceuticals	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article								Staff preparing and injecting radiopharmaceuticals in hospitals may receive significant radiation doses to their hands. These doses may be high enough to warrant that they be classified as radiation workers. The influence of local shielding on finger doses has been investigated. Staff preparing radioactive liquids in a radionuclide dispensary and drawing up and injecting radiopharmaceuticals in a nuclear medicine department have been studied. Measurements have been recorded with an electronic extremity dose monitor, an advanced extremity gamma instrumentation system (AEGIS), worn near to the finger tip. The electronic dosimeter allows the pattern of doses received during different procedures to be determined. Doses received for individual manipulations during many routine sessions have been recorded for different staff members. Dose distributions around shielded vials and syringes have also been measured using AEGIS. In the radionuclide dispensary the vials from which radioactive liquids are dispensed are held in tungsten shields, whereas in nuclear medicine simple lead pots are used. Syringe shields are employed for some parts of dispensing and patient injections. Data on dose distributions have been used in interpretation of results from monitoring. Use of syringe shields during dispensing reduced the finger dose by 75-85%. The peaks in dose rate were 60% lower, and periods of exposure to high dose rates were reduced in length by a third because of the restriction in the region of high dose rate. The extremity doses to staff dispensing and injecting radiopharmaceuticals in nuclear medicine were of similar magnitude. Doses received during dispensing varied from 10 to 555 muGy depending upon whether the vial containing the radiopharmaceutical was directly handled or not. Dose received from individual injections varied from 1 to 150 muGy depending on the degree of difficulty experienced during the injection.

PHENIX; heavy ions; spectrometer	GEV AU+AU COLLISIONS; ROOT(NN)-N-S=130 GEV; CENTRALITY DEPENDENCE; DEUTERIUM	The PHENIX detector is designed to perform a broad study of A-A, p-A, and p-p collisions to investigate nuclear matter under extreme conditions. A wide variety of probes, sensitive to all timescales, are used to study systematic variations with species and energy as well as to measure the spin structure of the nucleon. Designing for the needs of the heavy-ion and polarized-proton programs has produced a detector with unparalleled capabilities. PHENIX measures electron and muon pairs, photons, and hadrons with excellent energy and momentum resolution. The detector consists of a large number of subsystems that are discussed in other papers in this volume. The overall design parameters of the detector are presented. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

An exploratory study of such a source is realized. A survey of the radiative electron energy loss theory is reported in order to estimate numerically the bremsstrahlung production of thick targets. The resulted bremsstrahlung angular and energy theoretical distributions delivered from W and UCx thick converters are presented and compared with previous results. Some quantities as the number of fission events produced in the fissionable source and the energy loss in the converters are also reported as function of the geometry of the combination and the incident electron energy. An attempt of comparison with experimental data shows a quantitative agreement. This study is focussed on initial kinetic energies of the electron beam included in the range 30-60 MeV, suitable for the production of large radiative gamma-ray yields able to induce the U-238 fission through the giant dipole resonance. A confrontation with the number of fission events produced in the frame of the fast neutron induced fission method indicates that the photo-fission can be a competitive concept.

Water-reflected and unreflected 80-cm-diam cylindrical cores were used to obtain the systematic data of critical solution height and differential reactivity for various uranium concentrations from 190 to 240 g/l. The numerically evaluated extrapolation length of neutron flux distribution was in good agreement with the experimental result. The effective neutron multiplication factor k(eff) for each core configuration and the effect of uncertainties on k(eff) were also numerically evaluated with both the detailed experimental configuration of critical cores and a benchmark model provided for the validation of nuclear calculation codes. The MCNP 4B was used for the evaluation calculations with JENDL-3.2 cross-section library, and the value of the keff of the benchmark model was reproduced within the difference of 0.05% Deltak(eff) for the water-reflector cores and 0.17% Deltak(eff) for the unreflected cores.

Through the failed bottom wall, part of the corium can flow into the cavity, and air can enter the primary circuit. The residual fuel in the core periphery will be further oxidized in air atmosphere. The degradation process will accelerate, and new chemical species will be formed, which can have an impact on the release of radioactive materials. Two experiments were carried out with electrically heated nine-rod pressurized water reactor-type bundles in the CODEX (COre Degradation EXperiment)facility to provide experimental data on the behavior of real fuel bundles under air oxidation conditions. The main objective of the tests was the investigation of oxidation phenomena, and some other important aspects (e.g., enhanced fission product release) were not addressed. The CODEX air ingress tests indicated the acceleration of oxidation phenomena and core degradation processes during the late phase of the vessel melt through accident, when air can have access to the residual fuel bundles in the reactor core. The degradation process was accompanied with zirconium-nitride formation and release of uranium-rich aerosols.

J	Nasif, HR; Neyama, A; Umeki, H; Suzuki, A				Nasif, HR; Neyama, A; Umeki, H; Suzuki, A			Wavelet integrated system to calculate radionuclide release from a repository in fractured media	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						wavelet; repository; connection coefficients		Radionuclides released from a vitrified waste package after overpack failure spread into the buffer material surrounding the waste package, then migrate through different pathways into the water-bearing fracture in the rock surrounding the high-level radioactive waste repository, and transport through the faults to the biosphere. The buffer material has low permeability and the solute is transported through the engineered barrier system by diffusion only. In the water-bearing fracture, the problem is of the convection diffusion type with highly varying parameters from one medium to the other due to the variability in length, transmissivity, and other transport-relevant properties of the transport paths. This complex geometry is modeled using the wavelet Galerkin approach. The Wavelet Integrated Repository System (WIRS) wavelet-based system is an integrated tool to calculate the transport of single or radionuclide chains in both near and far fields of the repository system. The model, which is a very coarsely discretized wavelet based, is devised to be very fast since the scaling functions, which are used as a basis function, are compactly supported. Only finite numbers of the connection coefficients are nonzero, and the resultant matrix has a block diagonal structure that can be inverted easily. One of the main problems encountered in solving the model for the radio-nuclide transport in the geospheric media is the treatment of the boundary and interface conditions. In order to maintain the integrity of the system, the boundaries of the wavelet series are shifted until the end is independent of any expansion coefficients of the scaling function that affect the solution within the real boundaries. WIRS agreed well with models using a very detailed discretization. Accuracy is gained with the proper selection of wavelet-dilation orders pair. WIRS has been applied to the Japanese high-level radioactive waste repository, concept where the migration is through different barriers and pathways. Single and decay chain radionuclide release calculations have shown the capability of WIRS to handle different situations rapidly and easily.

J	Gombert, D; Richardson, JR				Gombert, D; Richardson, JR			Cold-crucible induction melter design and development	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						cold crucible; induction melter; waste vitrification		The international process for immobilization of high-activity waste from aqueous fuel reprocessing is vitrification. In the United States joule-heated melter technology has been implemented at West Valley and the Savannah River Site, but improved melter concepts are sought to bring down the costs of processing. The cold-crucible induction melter (CCIM) design is being evaluated for many applications, including radioactive wastes because it eliminates many materials and operating constraints inherent in the baseline technology. The cold-crucible design is also smaller, less expensive, and generates much less waste for ultimate disposal. In addition, it should allow a much more flexible operating envelope, which will be crucial if the heterogeneous wastes at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) reprocessing sites are to be vitrified. A joule-heated melter operates by passing current between water-cooled electrodes through a molten pool in a refractory-lined chamber. This design is inherently limited by susceptibility of materials to corrosion and melting, In addition, redox conditions and free metal content have exacerbated materials problems or lead to electrical short-circuiting causing failures in developmental DOE melters. In contrast, the CCIM design is based on inductive coupling of a water-cooled high-frequency electrical coil with the glass, causing eddy, currents that produce heat and mixing. While significant marketing claims have been made by technology suppliers and developers, little data is available for engineering and economic evaluation of the technology, and no facilities are available in the United States to support testing. In addition to verifying the capabilities of the technology, further development can exploit opportunities for optimization through better understanding of the electromagnetic thermal phenomena intrinsic to the cold-crucible melter. Induction frequency, applied power, and coil and crucible configuration are all related but independent variables that can be explored to optimize throughput while designing a system for maximum reliability in a remote environment. This paper is an introduction to the technology as it applies to vitrification of materials not electrically conductive at ambient temperatures, the potential for research improvements, and the new system being built at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory.

In this paper we present a method, which makes it possible to measure the surface and bulk activities of Ra-226 in thin nylon foils for use in BOREXINO at unprecedented concentration levels, as low as 0.5 muBq/m(2) and 10 muBq/kg, respectively. It is based on high-sensitivity Rn-222 emanation detection, taking advantage of the fact that the permeability of nylon for radon is strongly enhanced in the presence of water. A mathematical diffusion model is outlined to distinguish the surface and bulk activity of Ra-226 from the Rn-222 emanation rates of dry and wet film. The experimental method is described in connection with screening measurements of nylon foils of different origin. One foil could be identified with a low Ra-226 contamination (corresponding to similar to10(-12) g/g U-238-equivalent) for application in BOREXINO. This film will be used for the construction of a liquid scintillator containment vessel as the central part of the BOREXINO solar neutrino detector. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In particular, the alpha/beta light ratio and the possibility of a pulse-shape discrimination between alpha particles and gamma quanta have been studied. The radioactive contamination of the crystal has been investigated. The application of the obtained results in the search for rare processes such as the two neutrino double electron capture in Ce-136 and Ce-138 and the alpha activity in Ce-142 has been investigated. As a result, new T-1/2 limits for these processes have been deter-mined (90% C.L.): T-1/2(2v2) (K)(Ce-136)greater than or equal to 2 7 x 10(16) yr, T-1/2(2v2) (K)(Ce-138)greater than or equal to 3.7 x 10(16) yr and T-1/2(alpha) (Ce-142)greater than or equal to 2.9 x 10(18) yr.

A basic question related to the practical introduction of such an IMF into a current-day LWR, without affecting any significant change in fuel element design and core performance, is the irradiation behaviour of the proposed IMF. The present paper reports first results from a corresponding validation experiment which has been launched recently, viz. the comparative in-pile testing of specially fabricated IMF and PuO2/UO2 mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel rodlets in the Halden reactor. The maximum linear power rating was limited to about 25 kW/m during the currently reported initial testing phase, as compared to the design value of 35 kW/m to be aimed at during subsequent cycles at Halden. While fuel centre-line temperatures were found to be within the expected range for both fuel types, the variation of pressure in the rodlets has clearly indicated significant densification in the IMF specimens, with fission gas release being not detectable at the low burnups achieved to date. A possible sintering model for the IMF is proposed to explain the experimental results obtained during this moderate-power testing phase, viz. the apparent "geometrical stability" of the IMF in spite of its strong initial densification.

For all the used fuel types the void coefficient of the reactivity is positive. In our paper a heterogeneous two-stratified coolant model is used for SEU-43 fuel bundle type. This is slightly enriched uranium (near 1%) with 43 fuel rods developed in INR Pitesti. The coolant is treated as a two-phase (liquid and vapour) medium, gravitationally separated. Eigenvalues are computed with the transport code CP_2D at different void fractions and burnup points. For the fresh fuel the MCNP results on the two-startified model a homogeneous model is used to benchmark CP_2D results. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Results have been analyzed by Langmuir and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) adsorption isotherms. The mean energy of adsorption 7.14 kJ mol(-1) was calculated from the D-R adsorption isotherm. In order to understand the significance of the diffusion mechanisms and to accurately estimate the diffusivities inside the adsorbent particles, a model for uranium(VI) adsorption on amberlite IR-118H was used. The rate constants have been calculated for 293, 313 and 333 K using Lagergren equation and the activation energy (Ea) was derived using the Arhenius equation. The thermodynamic quantities for the process of adsorption have been estimated by plotting Ln K-D versus 1/T. The DeltaHdegrees and DeltaGdegrees values of uranium(VI) adsorption on amberlite IR-118H show endothermic heat of adsorption; higher temperatures favor the process. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The experiments were performed at the Dubna High Energy Laboratory using the nuclotron accelerator. Two different experimental set-ups were used to produce neutron spectra convenient for transmutation of radioactive waste by (n,x) reactions. By a theoretical analysis neutron spectra can be reproduced from activation measurements.

The approach, based on solid phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with a carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane based fibre, was optimised with respect to extraction time (10 min), extraction temperature (60degreesC) and phase volume ratio (1). The analysis time, including extraction, was less than 20 min with linear responses for acetonitrile and ethanol over the ranges: 0.09-80 mug cm(-3) (22degreesC, acetonitrile) and 0.78-79 mug cm(-3) (22degreesC, ethanol). The detection limits were estimated to be ca. 0.78 mug cm(-1) for ethanol and 0.09 mug cm(-1) for acetonitrile. Stability studies indicated analyte losses of up to 75% over 24 h and analysis of aged 2-[F-18]FDG samples showed that levels of ethanol and acetonitrile were not less than 100 mug cm(-1), indicative of levels substantially greater than this in the original infusions given to human subjects.

An HPGe-based gamma-ray spectroscopy system was used, and the effects of the angular correlation and pulse pile-up were corrected, and are discussed. The correction for the angular correlation was obtained from a theoretical calculation, while the pulse pile-up effect was corrected using a new extrapolation technique based on the pile-up measurements by varying the shaping time of the amplifier. The determined radioactivities were within 2% deviation from the values reported by the supplier and the associated uncertainties were less than 2%. The observed consistency was obtained under the experimental condition of keeping the total counting rate less than or equal to 15 kcps. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The scintillator shape and dimensions have been optimized for maximum charge particle detection efficiency, while keeping background low and a nearly constant gamma-ray efficiency for different points from the radioactive source. The gamma-ray events were measured with a NaI(TI) scintillation counter. The electronic system for processing pulses consisted of logic gates and delay modules feeding a time-to-amplitude converter with output to a multichannel analyzer. The alpha detection efficiency measured with (241)Am was around 95% and the beta detection efficiency for (60)Co was around 67%. Activity measurements of (241)Am and (60)Co were performed and the results showed good agreement when compared with a conventional coincidence system employing a 4pi proportional counter.

The previous techniques recorded radioactive mineralization for the first time along the NW-SE trending fault zones within the Miocene clastic-carbonate sediments. In the present study, gamma-ray spectrometry was used to confirm the presence of this mineralization. Concentrations of radionuclides, associated within the iron ochre at Um-Greifat area, have been measured, using a hyper-pure germanium spectrometer. The variation in concentration of radionuclides for the area under investigation can be classified into A, B and C regions of high, medium and low natural radioactivity. In region A, average concentration in Bq kg(-1) has been observed to range from 1858 to 4062 for U-238, between 29 and 151 for Th-232, from 60 to 136 for U-235 and between 46 and 409 Bq kg(-1) for K-40. Radium equivalent activities (Ra-eq) in addition to external and internal hazard indices (H-ex, H-in) have also been determined. Ra-eq varies between 1901 and 4307 Bq kg(-1), which exceeds the permitted value (370 Bq kg(-1)) and H-ex and H-in are higher than 1. The high activity concentration within region A points to an environmental hazard, while regions B and C have less exposure effect on human beings. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Neutron activation analysis has been used to determine the elemental content of monazite samples. Twelve elements Sc, Cr, Fe, Co, Zn, Cs, La, Eu, Sm, Hf, Pa and Np are observed and the concentrations of these elements have been calculated. Using passive measurements natural radioactivity has also been determined in Bq/kg for the investigated monazite samples. Th and U concentrations from both passive and active measurements are in agreement. Some of the observed elements have a high economic value. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The construction and state of most of the storages sites do not meet modem requirements because of the long time that these sites have been in operation and because the depths reach ground water, if the required protective barriers are absent. Consequently, there is a real danger that the radionuclides will contaminate the ground waters and the surrounding environment. To prevent this from happening, a system of measures must be instituted to put into place the required safety barriers or the sites must be liquidated. The results of an investigation of the radioactive contamination of spent graphite sleeves from the Siberian Chemical Combine are reported. These results show that the quite low contamination level of the sleeves permits salvaging them by incineration. In so doing, the risk of negative public-health effects in the region of the combine due to C-14 emissions into the atmosphere will be neglible.

J	Hustedt, M				Hustedt, M			From the atomic age to the solar age	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								One of the most important decisions taken in energy policy in recent years is the "Act on the Planned Termination of the Use of Nuclear Power for Industrial Generation of Electricity." A technology incorporating the hazard of catastrophic accidents, environmental pollution, and detrimental consequences to health, as well as the open question of managing radioactive waste, is not fit for the future. This turnaround in energy policy marks the beginning of the required entry into the solar age. Changing our energy supply is necessary in the light of the threatening scenarios of global climate change and the finite nature of fossil sources of energy, and needs a clear political dimension. The framework conditions to be established by politics for a sustainable power economy thus rest on three pillars: Expansion of renewable energy sources, improvement of energy efficiency, an ddecentralized structures in energy supply. The success of our national energy policy also offers incentives to other countries and for exports. At EU level, important decisions in the interest of the consumer must be supported.
