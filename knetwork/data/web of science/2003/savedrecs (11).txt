The identification and tracking of low energy protons permits using deuterium as an effective neutron target. For this purpose, modular self-triggering tracking telescopes built up by double-sided silicon strip detectors inside the accelerator ultra-high vacuum have been developed. Their basic features are DeltaE/E proton identification from 2.5-40 MeV and particle tracking over a wide dynamic range, either 2.5 MeV spectator protons or minimum ionizing particles. By the use of self-triggering read-out chips, the telescopes identify a particle passage within 100 ns and therefore allow the possibility of a fast hit pattern recognition. In combination with a read-out pitch of similar to200 mum, they provide a high rate capability. The recent development of very thick (greater than or equal to5 mm) double-sided microstructured Si(Li) and very thin (less than or equal to65 mum) double-sided Si-detectors provides the use of the telescopes over a wide range of particle energies.

One potential value of such a combination is the ability to quickly obtain information about breast shape and lesion position within the breast via X-ray and then to use this information to perform corrections to the gamma image(s). In particular, the effects of gamma ray attenuation, gamma camera resolution, and scatter can be taken into account so as to better estimate the difference between the image contrast and true radioactivity contrast. The authors present results of a phantom study designed to test how well the lesion-to-background contrast can be predicted by this method. The preliminary results indicate that the effects of attenuation, partial volume averaging, and scatter on lesion image contrast can be modeled and suggest that the model might be usefully employed in the dual modality breast scanner to correct the breast scintigram for these effects.

Refractory metals and alloys have much higher operating temperatures and neutron wall load (NWL) capabilities than low activation materials (ferritic/martensitic steels, vanadium alloys and SiC/SiC composites) and austenitic stainless steels. In this study, effect of primary candidate refractory alloys, namely, W-5Re, T111, TZM and Nb-1Zr on neutronic performance of the hybrid reactor was investigated. Neutron transport calculations were conducted with the help of SCALE 4.3 System by solving the Boltzmann transport equation with code XSDRNPM. Among the investigated structural materials, tantalum had the worst performance due to the fact that it has higher neutron absorption cross section than others. And W-5Re and TZM having similar results showed the best performance.

The studied inert matrix fuel is made of cubic stabilized zirconia. The limited number of experimental thermal conductivity data justifies this formal and intensive study. Approaches derived from Klemens theory were revisited and the derived conductivity model applied for zirconia, accounting the effects of phononic scattering centers. The hyperbolic thermal conductivity trend with temperature known for pure zirconia, is reduced by isotopes, impurities, dopants and oxygen vacancies, which act as scattering centers and contribute to conductivity reduction to a flat plot with temperature for stabilized zirconia. It is experimentally observed that the thermal conductivity derived from laser flash measurements for Er(x)Y(y)M(z)Zr(1-x-y-z)O(2-(x+y)/2) (with M = Cc or Pu, z = 0 or similar to0.1 and x + y = 0.15) is rather constant as a function of temperature in the range 300-1000 K. The thermal conductivity was observed to depend on the concentration of dopants such as YO(1.5) and/or ErO(1.5), CeO(2) (analogous of PuO(2)) or PuO(2) The bulk material conductivity of Er(0.05)Y(0.10)Pu(0.10)Zr(0.75)O(1.925) is about 2 Wm(-1) K(-1). In this study, the thermal conductivity data of both monoclinic and stabilized cubic zirconia based IMF are tested with the model approach in order to understand the experimental data in a semi-quantitative way.

Three different simulated specimens were used for the experiment; a solid solution of yttria-stabilized zirconia and ceria (composition: Er0.07Y0.10Ce0.15Zr0.68O1.915, 92.0% TD, specimen hereafter called Ce-ZrO2), a CeO2-dispersed Mg-spinel (composition: 15wt%CeO2-MgAl2O4, 93.7% TD, specimen hereafter called Ce-spinel) and a CeO2-dispersed silicon carbide (composition: 80.8 wt% SiC, 6.9 wt% Al2O3, 5.1 wt% Y2O3 and 5.0 wt% CeO2, specimen hereafter called Ce-SiC), CeO2 being surrogate materials for PuO2 Cyclic thermal shock experiment and thermal conductivity measurements were simultaneously carried out by heating disc-shaped specimens up to maximum temperature ranging from 1073 to 1673 K and then cooling down to 343 K with Ar gas during 20-25 min. The Vickers hardness of the three different thermally shocked specimens showed nearly constant values with increasing number of cycles, except for the specimen heated at 1673 K. The K-IC values of the corresponding specimens increased with the increasing number of cyclic thermal shock at 1673 K. For Ce-ZrO2 heated at 1673 K, however, it decreases considerably due to the combined effects of formation of second phase and modification of the matrix composition thereby. The calculated thermal conductivity of Ce-spinel decreases as the number of cycles in thermal shock increases in the temperature range between 1073 and 1673 K, and Ce-SiC slightly decreased with the number of cycles in cyclic thermal shock and the variations in thermal conductivity are almost the same for the temperature increases of 1073 and 1373 K, whereas, in Ce-ZrO2, it remains nearly constant.

The thermal conductivity of cubic zirconia is however lower than the conductivities of UO2 and MOX. Special designs are therefore necessary to avoid high peaking temperatures close to the melting point in the zirconia pellet. Cermet would be a favorable design to improve the thermal conductivity. The suggested cermet fuel consists of fine plutonium doped stabilized zirconia particles dispersed in a metallic inert matrix. Manufacturing tests on cubic zirconia microspheres were carried out by using the internal gelation process developed at the Paul Scherrer Institute. Gelation was conducted successfufly and the sintered spheres had a homogeneous single cubic structure. The lattice parameter of the cubic zirconia was estimated as a function of the Er, Y and Cc atomic fraction using a simplified semi-quantitative formula. On the experimental side, it is necessary to further investigate the ideal fabrication conditions, because some gel spheres were opaque and fragile and most of the sintered spheres were cracked, nicked and porous.

J	Pouchon, MA; Nakamura, M; Hellwig, C; Ingold, F; Degueldre, C				Pouchon, MA; Nakamura, M; Hellwig, C; Ingold, F; Degueldre, C			Cermet sphere-pac concept for inert matrix fuel	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th Inert Matrix Fuel Workshop (IMF-8)	OCT 16-18, 2002	TOKAI, JAPAN					In the inert matrix fuel concept, plutonium reprocessed from spent fuel is burned in an inert matrix, e.g. yttria-stabilized zirconia. Coming from wet reprocessing, the internal gelation can perform an easy micro-spheres production. Utilization of these particles in a sphere-pac realizes a direct fuel production. Besides being economical, this direct usage offers an almost dustless fabrication. One disadvantage of yttria-stabilized zirconia as matrix is its low thermal conductivity. A further reduction by the macroscopic structure of a sphere bed seems unacceptable. This can be eluded by the insertion of a highly conducting phase. Similar to the cermet concept with the embedment of ceramic fuel into metal, the infiltration of a fine metal fraction into a coarse ceramic fuel fraction is studied here. The initial thermal conductivity shows much higher calculated values and the sintering behaviour is also clearly enhanced compared to the pure ceramic bed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

In combination with the possibility to fabricate specialty shaped fuel pellets. e.g. barrel with a hole, an innovative fuel would be designed to reach higher burnup. The current project aims to use the direct coagulation casting process to shape mixed plutonium zirconium nitride annular pellets. As a backup option the conventional powder-pressing route is used to produce standard pellets. Gibbs energy calculations were used to optimise the thermal treatment of carborthermic reduction to yield mixed nitride powders. The status quo of the powder and pellet production as well as the first analytical results are presented in the following. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A first irradiation experiment of YSZ based IMF is ongoing in the OECD Material Test Reactor in Halden together with mixed oxide fuel. The results of the first two cycles for IMF to a burnup of some 105 kWd cm(-3) are presented and the modelling results in comparison with the experimental results are shown. A first approximation for a simple swelling model for this YSZ based IMF can be given. Possible fission gas release mechanisms are briefly discussed. The implications of the modelling results are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Single phase yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ), homogeneous mixture of YSZ/spinel and YSZ particle dispersed in spinel type ROX fuels were pulse irradiated in the Nuclear Safety Research Reactor (NSRR). Mode and threshold of the fuel rod failure including its consequences were investigated under the RIA conditions. The cladding failure occurred in a burst type mode in all the three types of ROX fuel tests with considerable fuel melting. Even though the mode was quite different from those of UO2 fuel, failure threshold enthalpies of the ROX fuels were close to that of UO2 fuel at about 10 GJ m(-3). The consequence of the failure of the ROX fuels rods was different from the one of UO2 fuel rods, because molten fuel dispersal occurred at lower enthalpies in the ROX fuel tests. Change of the fuel structure and material interaction in the transient heating conditions were examined through optical and secondary electron microscopy, and electron probe micro analysis.

During irradiation, the initially present Am-241 was converted for 99.8% to fission products (50%), plutonium (30%), curium (16%,) and Am-243 (4%). The UO2 spinel target experienced a burn-up of 32% fission per initial metal atom. The post irradiation examination of the AmOx inert matrix target showed swelling of 27 vol.%, and a gas release of 48% for He and 16% for Xe and Kr. The UO2 inert matrix target also showed a large volumetric swelling of 11%, directed mainly radially. Ceramography on the UO2 inert matrix target revealed a complete restructuring of the spinel grains upon irradiation and the absence of porosity, suggesting that amorphisation is the main cause of the swelling.

This study is the second phase of a series of Doppler effect experiments on the resonance materials, which follows the measurements in the fast neutron spectrum. The Doppler effect was measured as the sample reactivity change between the heated and unheated samples. Cylindrical samples of resonance materials such as erbium metal (Er), tungsten metal (W) and thorium dioxide (ThO2) were used. The sample was heated up to 1073 K at the center of the FCA core. The experiments were analyzed by the SRAC code system with the use of the JENDL-3.2 cross-section library. The calculated Doppler effects of the W and ThO2 samples agreed with the measured values within the experimental error, while the calculation overestimated the measured Doppler effect of the Er sample by 12%.

A demonstration of the possibility of transmutation of minor actinides and long-lived fission products with a realistic design of experimental fuel targets and prognosis of their behaviour under typical ADS conditions is an important task in the MYRRHA project. In the present article, the irradiation behaviour of three different oxide fuel mixtures, containing americium and plutonium - (Am,Pu,U)O2-x with urania matrix, (Am,Pu,Th)O2-x with thoria matrix and (Am,Y,Pu,Zr)O2-x with inert zirconia matrix stabilised by yttria - were simulated with the new fuel performance code MACROS, which is under development and testing at the SCK.CEN. All the fuel rods were considered to be of the same design and sizes: annular fuel pellets, helium bounded with the stainless steel cladding, and a large gas plenum. The liquid lead-bismuth eutectic was used as coolant. Typical irradiation conditions of the hottest fuel assembly of the MYRRHA subcritical core were pre-calculated with the MCNPX code and used in the following calculations as the input data. The results of prediction of the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the designed rods with the considered fuels during three irradiation cycles of 90 EFPD are presented and discussed.

In a first step, core-follow calculations for four real-life cores with increasingly larger mixed-oxide (MOX) loadings were validated against measured plant data. In a second step, core loadings with inert matrix fuel (IMF) have been designed and considered which contain, on the average, the same amounts of plutonium as the four partial MOX loadings. From the latter loadings, the IMF rods with the highest power ratings were identified. The data depend on a pin power reconstruction of three-dimensional nodal calculations, and a partial verification of the pin power values was carried out using the transport codes CASMO and HELIOS as well as the Monte Carlo code MCNP. Fuel behaviour calculations were then performed for the highest power-rating rods employing models partly validated via recent data from the comparatory IMF/MOX irradiation test currently under way at Halden. Based on the various results obtained, conclusions have been drawn regarding IMF rod designs most likely to yield (in partial IMF core loadings) fuel behaviour similar to that of UO2 fuel.

In these WWER-type fuel elements with cermet fuel, the fuel is bonded to cladding in a metallurgic way. It possesses some special features allowing the fuel to be used for both steady-state and load following operation modes. The study presents the results of the analytic study of the two variants of cermet fuel based on UO2 and UO2 + ThO2. The use of burnable poisons Er2O3 and Gd2O3 was considered. Characteristics of WWER with UO2 + ThO2 cermet fuel has been compared with those for conventional ceramic uranium dioxide fuel. In-pile testing of UO2 cermet fuel elements was carried out successfully up to a burnup of congruent to60 MW d kg(-1) of U. Results of stress calculations have shown fuel element cladding stability for operation in the load following mode. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The main goal is to achieve high degree of plutonium incineration in once-through cycle. In this paper we considered two fuel compositions. In both compositions weapons grade plutonium is used as fissile material. Spinel (MgAl2O4) is used as the 'preserving' material assuring safe storage of the spent fuel. Besides an inert matrix, the option of rock-like fuel with thorium dioxide was studied. One of principal problems in the realization of the proposed approach is the substantial change of properties of the light water reactor core when passing to the use of the ROX-fuel, in particular: (i) due to the absence of U-238 the Doppler effect playing a crucial role in reactor's self-regulation and limiting the consequences of reactivity accidents, decreases significantly, (ii) no fuel breeding on one hand, and the quest to attain the maximum plutonium burnup on the other hand, would result in a drastical change of the fuel assembly power during the lifetime and, as a consequence, the rise in irregularity of the power density of fuel assemblies, (iii) both the control rods worth and dissolved boron worth decrease in view of neutron spectrum hardening brought on by the larger absorption cross-section of plutonium as compared to uranium, (iv) beta(eff) is markedly reduced. All these distinctive features are potentially detrimental to the reactor nuclear safety. The principal objective of this work is that to identify a variant of the fuel composition and the reactor layout, which would permit neutralize the negative effect of the above-mentioned distinctive features.

For the improvement of small negative reactivity coefficients and severe transient behaviors of ROX fueled LWRs, a partial loading core of ROX fuel assemblies with conventional UO2 assemblies was considered. As a result, although the reactivity coefficients could be improved, the power peaking tends to be large in this heterogeneous core configuration. The reactivity initiated accident (RIA) and loss of coolant accident (LOCA) behaviors were not sufficiently improved. In order to reduce the power peaking, the fuel composition and the assembly design of the ROX fuel were modified. Firstly, erbium burnable poison was added as Er2O3 in the ROX fuel to reduce the burnup reactivity swing. Then pin-by-pin Pu enrichment and Er content distributions within the ROX fuel assembly were considered. In addition, the Er content distribution was also considered in the axial direction of the ROX fuel pin. With these modifications, a power peaking factor even lower than the one in a conventional UO2 fueled core can be obtained. The RIA and LOCA analyses of the modified core have also shown the comparable transient behaviors of ROX partial loading core to those of the UO2 core. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

This options range from the use of mature technologies like MOX adapted in the case of MOX-EUS (enriched uranium support) and COmbustible Recyclage A ILot (CORAIL) assemblies to more innovative technologies using IMF like DUPLEX and advanced plutonium assembly (APA). The plutonium burning performances reported to the electrical production go from 7 to 60 kg (TWh)(-1). More detailed analysis covering economic, sustainability, reliability and safety aspects and their integration in the whole fuel cycle would allow identifying the best candidate.

J	Kuramoto, K; Nitani, N; Yamashita, T				Kuramoto, K; Nitani, N; Yamashita, T			Durability test on irradiated rock-like oxide fuels	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th Inert Matrix Fuel Workshop (IMF-8)	OCT 16-18, 2002	TOKAI, JAPAN				REACTOR	For a profitable use of Pu, Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute has been promoting researches for once-through type fuels. The strategy consists of stable rock-like oxide fuel fabrication in conventional fuel facilities followed by almost complete Pu burning in LWR and disposal of chemically stable spent fuel without further processing. Because leach rates of hazardous nuclides, such as TRU and P-emitters, that have long half-lives, are very important for the evaluation of geological safety, leaching tests in deionized water at 363 K were performed with reference to the MCC-1 method. Five irradiated fuel pellets, a single phase fuel of a yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) containing UO2 (U-YSZ), two fuels of U-YSZ particle dispersed in MgAl2O4 (SPI) or Al2O3 (COR) matrix, two homogeneous-blended fuels of U-YSZ and SPI or COR powders, were submitted to the tests. Stainless steel containers with Au coating and ethylene propylene diene monomer were used as leaching vessels and packing, respectively. The evaluated normalized leach rates of Zr, U and Pu were obviously lower than those of the other important elements and nuclides. Americium, Np and especially Y showed unexpectedly high evaluated normalized leach rates. The volatile elements, Cs and I, showed enhanced leaching within particle-dispersed type fuels because of crack formation around the particle. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Since NOx is generated by the reaction of sodium nitrite and nitric acid, non-radioactive sodium nitrate is also formed as a by-product. In order to reduce the amounts of radioactive and non-radioactive sodium nitrate wastes, a new method was examined to recover NOx for recycling from the off-gas of the denitrator of uranyl nitrate solution. Fundamental and consequent bench scale experiments showed that the vacuum pressure swing adsorption method, using combined silica-gel and clinoptilolite for water vapor removal and pentasil zeolite for NOx recovery, is applicable for this purpose.

Various axial burnup profiles from almost symmetry to strong asymmetry based on in-core flux measurements are proposed in the OECD/NEA Phase II-C burnup credit benchmark problem. In some cases, calculations by ordinary Monte Carlo method show very slow convergence of fission source distribution, and unacceptably large skipped cycles are needed to obtain a reliable fission source distribution for statistic criticality estimation. The matrix eigenvector calculation developed and incorporated in the ordinary Monte Carlo calculation to accelerate the slow fission source convergence is applied to the benchmark. The efficiency of acceleration by the matrix eigenvector calculation depends on the precision of fission matrix elements. In a certain stage of source iteration with acceleration repetition of fission source distribution, especially for this benchmark problem of very slow convergence, more acceleration repetitions cause anomalous results because of large statistic fluctuations of the estimation of fission matrix elements for regions with very low source levels. Here, we propose a new source acceleration method to detail with the slow convergence with less calculation time by modeling the division of fissile fuel region.

Part of the underlying cause of this resistance is the technical complexity of containment of radiation, geological space and time and mathematical expressions of degrees of hazard and risk. There are additional community concerns, typified by the inherent limitation to forward time projection, and industry must apply more sociology so as to understand better the base to these. There is underlying public support for the proper disposal of all hazardous waste but the schemes must conform to public requirements. A disposal regime that can be reversed, or where the wastes can be recovered if necessary, probably has a higher public acceptance but this needs to be tested. The next advancement in solving the waste issue will come from a better understanding of the public psyche by industry and not by a better understanding of the industry by the public.

J	Butler, G; Curtis, C				Butler, G; Curtis, C			Passive storage of radioactive waste	NUCLEAR ENERGY-JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH NUCLEAR ENERGY SOCIETY			English	Article						radiation protection; safety & hazards; waste management & disposal		The absence of a policy for long-term management of either intermediate- or high-level waste has led to increased emphasis by both regulators and waste producers on long-term storage in regimes in which the need for human intervention is minimised. The concepts of 'passivity' of waste and its 'passive storage' have been much discussed, and their attributes defined. However, there has been a tendency to take 'passive' as an absolute. which it simply cannot be. This paper discusses passivity and passive storage, suggests definitions for relevant terms, and makes a case for a semiquantitative index to measure the level of passivity represented by a given waste inventory. It also suggests that such an index would prove a valuable tool for judging the progress of waste treatment and decommissioning programmes. Further, increasing passivity may well reduce security concerns, and a preliminary discussion of this concept is presented.

The radius of the BPP and the number of particles per fuel pebble have been varied to find the flattest reactivity-to-time curve. It was found that for a kinfinity of 1.1, a reactivity swing as low as 2% can be obtained when each fuel pebble contains about 1070 BPP with aradius of 75 mum. Forcoated BPP that consist of a graphite kernel with a radius of 300 mum covered with a B4C burnable poison layer, a similar value for the reactivity wing can be obtained. Cylindrical particles seem to perform worse. In general, the modification of the geometry of BPP is an effective means to tailor the reactivity curve of HTRs. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The reactor concept is based on the deep burnup of initially loaded plutonium fuel at its single use in core and the subsequent disposal of the spent fuel without additional processing. The present paper describes the analysis of the basic features of the GT-MHR reactor core fueled by plutonium: 1. The annular type core design is used to decrease fuel temperature in accidents without active heat removal. 2. Unlike other alternatives for plutonium disposition (MOX fuel), in the basic variant of GT-MHR reactor design no fertile materials such as U-238, or Th-232 are used. Erbium is used as a burnable poison and means for ensuring the negative reactivity temperature coefficient. 3. Deep fuel burnup (640 MW day/kg on the average) leads to the significant accumulation of Pu-241 during irradiation of weapons grade Pu fuel. This fact determines the specific time dependence of the multiplication factor in the end of the fuel lifetime. 4. Rather hard neutron spectrum in the annular-type active core, and the essentially thermal spectrum in the reflectors cause a peak in the power distribution near the core-reflector boundary. Fuel and burnable poison zoning are used to control power profile. 5. The movement of control rods located in the side reflector noticeably deforms the power distribution in the core. 6. The temperature coefficient of reactivity depends both on the temperature and burnup level. In the GT-MHR reactor with plutonium fuel the temperature reactivity coefficient has values close to zero for temperatures less than 400 degreesC at the end of the partial fuel cycle. 7. Deep fuel burnup, achievable through the use of fuel particles with multilayer coatings, and high efficiency of transforming the thermal energy into electricity allow the effective utilization of plutonium in the GT-MHR reactor.

Americium-241. Waste destruction would be performed rapidly, without multiple reprocessing of plutonium, thus eliminating the risks of repeated handling of weapons-usable material and limiting the generation of secondary waste. There appears to be no incentive in continuing the destruction of waste beyond this level. An essential feature of the Deep-burn Transmuter is the use of ceramic-coated fuel particles that provide very strong containment and are highly resistant to irradiation, thereby allowing very extensive destruction levels ("Deep Burn") in the one pass, using gas-cooled modular helium reactor (MHR) technology developed for high-efficiency energy production. The fixed moderator (graphite) and neutronically transparent coolant (helium) provide a unique neutron energy spectrum to cause Deep-Burn, and inherent safety features, specific to the destruction of nuclear waste, that are not found in any other design. Deep-Burn technology could be available for deployment in a relatively short time, thus contributing effectively to waste problem solutions. Extensive modeling effort has led to conceptual Deep-Burn designs that can achieve high waste destruction levels (70% in critical mode, 90% in with a supplemental subcritical step) within the operational envelope of commercial MHR operation, including long refueling intervals and the highly efficient production of energy (approximately 50%). To the plant operator, a Deep-burn Transmuter will be identical to its commercial reactor counterpart. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The silicon surface barrier detector (SBD) responds to the Li-6(n, alpha)triton reaction products generated in the thin film of lithiated glass entering the SBD. Neutron spectral information is present in the pulse height spectrum. An energy response is seen that clearly shows that neutrons from a Pu-Be source and from a deuterium-tritium (D-T) pulsed neutron generator can be differentiated and counted above a gamma background. The significant result is that the fissile content within a container can be measured using a pulsed D-T neutron generator using the neutrons that are counted in the interval between the pulses.

The disadvantage of such an alpha-Be source is that they emit neutrons at a steady rate even when stored. These conventional generators are extremely awkward to use in many applications because of the neutron shielding required to prevent exposure to personnel and sensitive electronics. Recently, at our laboratory acid others, the possibility of using switchable radioactive neutron sources has been investigated. These sources rely on a mechanical operation to separate the alpha-emitting radioisotope from the Be target, thus allowing the source to be switched on and off. The utility of these new switchable sources is critically dependent on the selection of the alpha-emitting radioisotope. In this paper we discuss issues that determine the desirability of an alpha-emitting source for a switchable:neutron generator, and select alpha emitters that are best suited for use in this application.

The sensor elements have a high efficiency for detecting neutrons and exhibit excellent gamma-ray discrimination based on pulse-shape analysis. The short die-away time of the counter that is based on these detector elements allows coincidence-gate settings shorter than 10 mus. This qualifies the technology for measurements of materials with high yields of uncorrelated neutrons from Am-241(alpha,n) reactions. The characteristics of the new neutron counter will be illustrated with test data from measurements of plutonium, Cf-252, and gamma-ray sources. The integrated electronics design of the new detector also permits the simultaneous but independent measurement of both neutrons and gamma rays. Recent test results that illustrate some unique applications of the sensor's versatility will also be presented. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The gamma ray astrophysics group at NRL has been developing germanium strip detectors for several years. We have shown that three-dimensional locations for gamma ray interactions can,be determined with sub-millimeter accuracy, and have also demonstrated imaging capability within a single germanium strip detector. We have also initiated work on thick, silicon strip detectors. This was based on the fact that three sequential interactions can enable the energy and direction cone of the incident gamma ray to be determined, even without total energy, deposition of the incident gamma ray. We are also working on low-power ASICs that are required to handle the large number of channels associated with arrays of strip detectors. Progress on this work will be presented, along with applications to high-energy astrophysics, medical imaging, nuclear physics, detection of fissile materials, and monitoring of environmental radioactivity.

The method pertains to an axially symmetric set-up in which a thin flat source is placed parallel to the diaphragm(s) and the detector. From a digital autoradiograph, the source's radial activity distribution is assessed. The source is virtually subdivided into concentric rings and the corresponding solid angle values are weighted with the relative contribution of the annular regions-of-interest to the total radioactivity of the source.

Two high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors and one Si(Li) detectors were simulated by the MCNP and GEANT codes. Critical parameters in the detector geometry were optimized to reproduce the experimental results from several point-like sources. Prediction of the simulation codes for extended sources of high-Z materials were compared with pure, metallic, aged thorium foils. The results indicate that the codes are metrologically valid for extrapolation or interpolation of efficiency experimental data in cases of difficult or impossible experimental determination.

The calculation is based on numerical integration and its validity was checked by comparing with the results of a Monte Carlo program. Formulas are given for point sources as well as circular and annular sources.

Often, quantification is limited by uncertainties in measured intensities. A technique was developed to reduce these uncertainties. The method involves obtaining a pure sample of a nuclide using radiochemical techniques, and using appropriate fractions for beta and gamma measurements. The beta emission rates were measured using a liquid scintillation counter, and the gamma emission rates were measured with a high-purity germanium detector. Results were combined to obtain absolute gamma emission probabilities. All sources of uncertainties greater than 0.1% were examined. The method was tested with Cl-38 and Rb-88.

At present, no reliable analytical method is available for precise determination of the activity. Very strong sources can be analyzed by neutron counting but the error is large. We propose to use gamma-ray spectroscopy for such analysis. In particular, high-energy gamma rays (above 1 MeV) of fission fragments in equilibrium with the source are very convenient because they have little absorption in materials surrounding the source. It is found that the 1435.8-keV gamma-ray of Cs-138 and the 1596.5-keV gamma-ray of La-140 are well isolated and sufficiently above the background under these peaks. We have measured the gamma/alpha ratio for the Cf-252 with an uncertainty of better than 5%. The experiment involved the preparation of several thin Cf-252 sources, alpha pulse height analysis, determination of alpha decay rate, and the measurement of gamma singles spectrum with a well-shielded germanium spectrometer. The measured ratio and the gamma-ray spectroscopy of unknown samples can provide the activity of Cf-252, in these samples. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Resins were investigated with bis(2-ethylhexyl)methane-diphosphonic acid (H2DEH[MDP], Dipex(R))) extractant, which has a strong affinity for tri-, tetra- and hexavalent actinides in dilute acids. Extractive scintillating resins were manifested (1) as a mixed bed of scintillating resin and extraction chromatographic resin and (2) by diffusing the organic fluor 2-(1-naphtyl)-5-phenyloxazole into macroporous polystyrene chromatographic resin, then coating with H2DEH[MDP], or by coating H2DEH[MDP] on scintillating polyvinyltoluene beads. The scintillation light was detected with a modified Hidex Triathler to allow for continuous flow measurements. The average detection efficiencies were 51.7+/-2.6% and 65.8 +/- 10.1 % for natural uranium and Am-241, respectively, for the extractant coated scintillator. The resin was stable for solution flow of up to 1000 ml resulting in rapid real-time quantification of natural uranium in groundwater down to 30 mug/ml. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The main tasks for carrying out measurements with this system were the control of possible leaks of radioactive substances into the ocean water and the assessment of radioactive effects on the environment. The system consisted of eight underwater gamma spectrometric detectors with scintillation crystals of NaI(Tl) 63 x 250 mm;, A special evaluation method and a computer program were developed for carrying out long-term continuous measurements, which allowed for the automation of the control process. International compatibility of the measurement results was provided by the traceability to the national standard. For this reason, each detector was tested for sensitivity to the Cs-137 radionuclide, uniformly spread in a quasi-infinite aqueous medium. The measurements showed that no gamma-irradiating radionuclides were released into the environment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The activity concentrations of the radionuclides. detected range from 0.20 +/- 0.002 to 48.42 +/- 5.32 Bq kg(-1). The overall natural radionuclide contribution to the radioactivity of the environment was found to be 404.16 +/- 23.44 Bq kg(-1). Of this, coal Waste (tailing) alone contributed 49.5%. representing the largest contribution. Coal contributed just 5.5%. A comparison of the concentrations obtained in this work for coal with those from other parts of the world indicates that the radioactivity content of the Nigerian bituminous coal is not significantly different. The outdoor and indoor exposure rates. in air 1m above the ground are estimated to be (6.31+/-1.20) x 10(-8) and (7.57+/-1.20) x 10(-8) Gy h(-1), respectively, for the mining environment. These values compare very well with the global values reported by UNSCEAR:5x 10(-8) and 6 x 10(-8) Gy h(-1), respectively. The resulting annual effective dose equivalent estimated is (4.49 +/- 0.74) x 10(-4) Sv yr(-1). This also compares favourably with the global value -4 x 10(-4) Sv yr(-1), reported by UNSCEAR.

The radionuclides identified with reliable regularity belong to the decay series of naturally occurring radionuclides headed by U-238 and Th-232. The non-decay series of naturally occurring K-40 was found to be below the limit of detection. The average specific activity concentration values obtained for Bi-214 Tl-208, and Ra-226 in the overburden are 165.64+/-2.91, 150.25 +/- 2.91 and 60.97 +/- 2.27 Bq kg(-1), respectively. The measured activity. in the bituminous sand layer is so low that it can be said to be non-radioactive. The result of the EDXRF supports the presence of radioelements in the overburden, which are likely to be embedded in accessory minerals like zircon and, tourmaline. Thus, surface exploration, technique using soil-gas radon measurement will not yield the desired result. Furthermore, the level of radioelements and associated decay daughter Rn-222 is not expected to cause any health hazard. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Off-line screening, utilizing a commercially available liquid scintillation counter (LSC) and online screening using a modified hand-held survey meter was evaluated in the laboratory for quantification of (TcO4-)-Tc-99 and uranium in groundwater. The detection efficiencies for uranium with the MnO2 coated PVT resin were determined to be 17-37% and 7-27% for the LSC and survey instrument, respectively. The loading efficiency of the uranium out of groundwater ranged from 16% to.26%. In contrast, the detection efficiencies for Tc-99 with the ES resin were determined to be 2-14% and 2-3% for LSC and hand-held survey meter, respectively, while the loading efficiency of the (TcO4-)-Tc-99 in groundwater acidified to pH 2 was nearly 100%.

Fissile (e.g., U, Pu) and other nuclear materials (e.g., D, Be) can be detected using 6-7 MeV gamma-rays produced in the F-19(p,alphagamma) O-16 reaction. These gamma-rays can induce, neutron emission via photoneutron and photofission processes in nuclear materials. However, they are not energetic enough to generate significant numbers of neutrons from common benign materials. Neutrons are counted using an array of BF3 tubes in a polyethylene moderator. A strong increase in neutron count rates is seen when irradiating depleted uranium, Be, D2O, and Li-6, with little or no increase for other materials (e.g., H2O, SS, Cu, Al, C, Li-7). Experiments using both photon and neutron shielding show that the technique is resistant to countermeasures. We have reduced the neutron background from proton beam reactions (thus increasing the system's sensitivity) and have tested a high-current gas cell which should be capable of operating at proton beam currents of up to 100 muA.

For nuclear safeguards, measurements must resolve the uranium complex at 186 keV and the plutonium complex at 414 keV. The kneed for adequate room-temperature resolution has been met by CdZnTe detectors, but these small detectors cannot produce the efficiency needed for broad application in nuclear safeguards. The high-pressure xenon (HPXe) detector offers resolution, efficiency, intrinsic radiation resistance and temperature stability, making this detector type a viable candidate for broad application in nuclear safeguards. We will examine the current status HPXe detector systems, contrast HPXe with other detector types for nuclear safeguards applications, and discuss our efforts to improve the HPXe detector operating characteristics.
