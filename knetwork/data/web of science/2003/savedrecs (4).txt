UO2 disks have been implanted with 1 MeV He-3 at a nominal fluence of 5 x 10(16) He-3 cm(-2) using a Van de Graaff accelerator. The He-3(d,alpha)H-1 nuclear reaction analysis method was used to determine the helium depth profile in the UO2 disks. Partial flaking was observed after annealing at 500 degreesC for local He concentration of 1 at.%. After annealing at 600 degreesC flaking has affected the whole surface. The formation of helium bubbles is discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Heisbourg, G; Hubert, S; Dacheux, N; Ritt, J				Heisbourg, G; Hubert, S; Dacheux, N; Ritt, J			The kinetics of dissolution of Th-1-x(x)2(U)O solid solutions in nitric media	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							THORIUM-DIOXIDE; SOLUBILITY; TEMPERATURE; MINERALS; SYSTEM; WATER; FUEL	The dissolution of thorium-uranium (IV) dioxide solid solutions has been investigated in nitric media as a function of several parameters (leaching time, acidity of the leachate, temperature and uranium substitution rate in the solid solution) by using batch experiments. The normalized dissolution rates were evaluated for Th1-xUxO2 with x < 0.5, leading to the determination of the partial order related to the proton concentration, n, and to the corresponding normalized dissolution rate constant at pH=0, k'(T.298 K). The normalized dissolution rate of Th1-xUxO2 increases with the acidity of the leachate, and with the amount of uranium in the solid for a given pH. As the thermodynamic equilibrium is not yet reached in acidic media after two years for the solid solutions with x < 0.5, only kinetics of the dissolution is described. The stoichiometry of the release of both actinides was verified until the precipitation of thorium occurred in the leachate for pH > 2, while uranium was released in the solution under uranyl form. The partial order related to the proton concentration was determined for ThO2, and three compositions of solid solutions. The variation of the normalized dissolution rate with temperature allowed to determine the activation energy following the Arrhenius law (20, 33 and 16 U mol(-1) for ThO2, Th0.63U0.37O2, and Th0.47U0.53O2, respectively) at pH 2. The dissolution mechanism of Th1-xUxO2 solid solutions was explained by three steps: initial oxidation of the uranium at the surface, protonation at the U(VI), Th(IV), U(IV) sites, then finally detachment of the surface complexes.

J	Manara, D; Renker, B				Manara, D; Renker, B			Raman spectra of stoichiometric and hyperstoichiometric uranium dioxide	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							MICROPROBE SPECTROSCOPY; FLUID INCLUSIONS; NUCLEAR-FUEL; OXIDES; SCATTERING; UO2	Raman spectra of stoichiometric and hyperstoichiometric uranium dioxide are presented, as measured on nucleargrade UO2 pellets treated under oxidising conditions to obtain different levels of hyperstoichiometry. The precipitation of higher oxides on the sample surface in contact with air, depending on the oxidation of the specimen, is observed. Modes revealing the formation on the surface of the compound U3O8, such as the line at 750 cm(-1), are detected in specimens with bulk O/U greater than or equal to 2.09. Particular attention is given to the behaviour of the line observed for stoichiometric UO2 at 1151 cm(-1), attributed to the crystal electric field Gamma(5) --> Gamma(3) transition. According to the presented measurements, such line can be regarded as a fingerprint of the quasi-perfect fluorite structure. Results are discussed and compared with those of some previous publications results on the same subject. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Koo, YH; Oh, JY; Lee, BH; Sohn, DS				Koo, YH; Oh, JY; Lee, BH; Sohn, DS			Three-dimensional simulation of threshold porosity for fission gas release in the rim region of LWR UO2 fuel	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							STEADY-STATE OPERATION; PELLETS; MODEL	The threshold porosity above which fission gas release channels would be formed extensively in the rim region of high burnup UO2 fuel was estimated by the Monte Carlo method and Hoshen-Kopelman algorithm. With the assumption that both rim pore and rim grain can be represented by cubes, the pore distribution in the rim was simulated three-dimensionally by the Monte Carlo method according to rim porosity and pore size distribution. Using the Hoshen-Kopelman algorithm, the fraction of open rim pores interlinked to the outer surface of a fuel pellet was derived as a function of the rim porosity. The simulation revealed that it is the rim porosity rather than the pore size distribution or rim thickness that determines the fraction of open pores connected to the pellet surface. The analysis also indicated that the threshold porosity is around 24%. above which the number of rim pores forming release channels increases very rapidly. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The compounds formed were characterized using thermal analytical techniques in Ar, vacuum and air, X-ray powder diffraction and effluent gas analysis by mass spectrometry. The compound formed through external gelation was found to form UO3 as an intermediate product (identified by O-2 loss to form U3O8) whereas the compound formed through internal gelation resulted in single-phase UO2, which could be sintered into homogeneous pellets with 97% th.d. in At + 2% H-2 atmosphere at temperatures as low as 1100 degreesC.

Results have been obtained on polycrystalline alpha-ZrO2 ceramics and YSZ single crystals implanted with 3-MeV He-3 ions at a depth around 7mum then isochronously annealed in air at temperatures between 200 and 1100 degreesC. In alpha-ZrO2, no change of the depth profile is found up to 800 degreesC. In contrast, two regimes are found in YSZ: (i) below 800 degreesC, diffusion is controlled by helium trapping at native oxygen vacancies (approximate to10 at.%), (ii) above 800 degreesC, helium escapes out of the profile, with almost complete outgassing at 1100 degreesC.

J	Rest, J				Rest, J			The effect of irradiation-induced gas-atom re-solution on grain-boundary bubble growth	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							FISSION-GAS; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; NUCLEAR-FUEL; RELEASE; UO2; MICROSTRUCTURE; PRECIPITATION; PRODUCTS; KINETICS; MODEL	The rim region of high-burnup fuels is characterized by an exponential growth of intergranular porosity. In particular, the understanding of the dynamics of irradiation-induced recrystallization and subsequent gas-bubble swelling requires a quantitative assessment of the nucleation and growth of grain-boundary bubbles. Calculations of bubble growth on the grain boundaries of irradiated nuclear fuels at relatively low temperatures have, in general, been performed under the assumption that these bubbles are not appreciably affected by irradiation-induced gas-atom resolution. In contrast, matrix bubbles are strongly affected by this bubble shrinkage mechanism and as a consequence are generally two to three orders or more of magnitude smaller than the grain-boundary bubbles. A variational method is used to calculate diffusion from a spherical fuel grain. The junction position of two trial functions is set equal to the bubble gas-atom knock out distance. The effect of grain size, gas-atom re-solution rate and diffusivity, gas-atom knock out distance, and grain-boundary bubble density on the growth of intergranular bubbles is studied, and the conditions under which intergranular bubble growth occurs are elucidated.

To evaluate some of these effects, a UO2 fuel, irradiated in a PWR, was irradiated with a helium beam at different doses. PIXE measurements of xenon and neodymium concentration on helium irradiated and non-irradiated areas showed that no major difference in the distribution of these fission products occurred due to helium irradiation. From these results, it is concluded that helium irradiation associated with alpha self-irradiation does not induce significant modification of gaseous fission products in storage conditions.

It was observed that Gd has large solid solubility in UO2 due to the same ionic radii of U4+ and Gd3+ in the lattice. On sintering, the observed reduction in the lattice parameter of UO2 with Gd addition is due to formation of oxygen ion vacancies. Two different methods were used for the preparation of specimen materials: co-precipitation and mechanical mixing. The co-precipitation route, unlike mechanical mixing route, gives atomistic mixtures where lattice parameter changes before sintering with addition of Gd. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The previous dynamic food chain model DYNACON considering Korean agricultural and environmental conditions, in which the initial input parameter, was radionuclide concentrations on the ground, is improved, so as to evaluate radioactive contamination to agricultural products from either radioactive air concentrations or radionuclide concentrations on the ground. As for the results, Wet deposition is a more dominant mechanism than dry deposition in contamination on the ground. While, the contamination levels of agricultural products are strongly dependent on radionuclide and precipitation when the deposition of radionuclides occurs. It means that the contamination levels of agricultural products are determined from which is the more dominant process between deposition on the ground and interception to agricultural plants.

It is shown that the chemical substances are a determining factor in environmental contamination. Their content in the atmosphere and sea water exceeds the admissable norms near sources, on the territory of the enterprises, and (for individual indicators) at populated points. Under these conditions, the concentration of technogenic radionuclides does not exceed the admissable norms and its damaging effect on man is hundreds and thousands of times less than that of chemicals.

The aim was to merge the laboratories knowledge to provide pellet injectors able to deliver pellets, either at low velocities (0.2 -1 km/s) and high frequencies (up to 20 Hz) or at high velocities ( > 3 km/s) and low frequency (0.1 Hz) in steady state mode. Researches and developments are, respectively, carried out at Saint Petersburg and at Grenoble. This paper reports the first results obtained at Grenoble on a repetitive two-stage gas gun (TSGG) coupled to a porous cell pellet generator. Such a TSGG was developed in 1992 by SBT for the single shot mode. Several modifications have been made to reach the repetitive mode. The TSGG breech peak pressure ranges from 20 to 160 MPa. Therefore, porous cell design was modified to stand these pressure levels. Pellet speeds from 1600 to 3000 m/s were performed with a cycle period from 15 to 34 s. The first campaign has produced promising results, firstly on the porous cell pellet generator technology that can provide repetitive deuterium ice formation, and secondly on the TSGG used also in a repetitive mode. For further experiments, improvements on cryostat design and on remote control system should be undertaken. New cryostat design will give access to lower cell temperature, necessary to improve the ice resistance and thus to allow higher pellet speeds. A fully automatic remote control system will improve the overall reliability of the injector and ease the sequence setting for shorter period operation. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

It will have the capability to inject continuously pellets of adjustable size (2-6 x 10(20) atoms) at frequency higher than 10 Hz, velocity between 100 and 900 m/s with a very high reliability. An optimised fast valve releasing a small amount of propellant gas per pellet is used for pneumatic acceleration. This gas can be managed with a reasonably sized pumping line.

In a preliminary test rig, a CT was operated under once through conditions to obtain data for the final design. The results of humidity measurements confirm the efficiency of the system. To demonstrate hydrogen extraction from a helium gas flow at the operating temperature of 78 K, the test rig will also include a liquid-nitrogen cooled adsorber bed designed and constructed at the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe. As the next step, a test facility on a technical scale (one-sixth of the flow rate of the ITER-HCPB) will be built in a glovebox in the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK) for tritium experiments with the two main components of the extraction process, i.e. the CT and the molecular sieve bed.

However, at lower temperatures, the release process of tritium from the breeders is known to be rather slow. For this reason, there is still a need to develop techniques that promote the release of bred tritium. In order to improve the recovery of tritium from blankets over a wide range of temperature, the effect of the difference in sweep gas composition was investigated. Out of pile tritium release experiments were conducted using the ceramic breeders irradiated in a research reactor. The experimental results reveal the benefit of the sweep gas with water vapor, which is effective to increase the tritium release rate from ceramic breeder materials especially at comparatively lower temperatures. The experimental result was analyzed using several numerical models, and it was found that the consideration of trapping and detrapping reactions is necessary to reproduce the experimental tritium release curve.

The plant is also used for processing tritiated heavy water waste; several tons of reactor quality heavy water have been obtained. Last year, the plant was updated to provide a means for heavy water detritiation with high detritiation factor. This paper describes the experimental results for heavy water detritiation. During heavy water purification from tritium detritiation factor about 103 was achieved. Heavy water with reduced contents of tritium less than 10(5) Bq/kg was withdrawn at the rate of 4.5 kg per day as a top product. The sample points located along the separation column allowed obtaining tritium concentration profiles within the column. The experimental data are compared with the ones predicted by computer simulation. CECE process is attractive for use in the heavy water hi-flux PIK reactor detritiation plant. This process can find an application at the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) fusion facility. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The inner deuterium/tritium fuel cycle of the Tritium Plant comprises the Tokamak Exhaust Processing (TEP) system, the Storage and Delivery System (SDS) including the Long Term Storage (LTS), the Isotope Separation System (ISS) and the Analytical System (ANS) as major subsystems. Besides the supply of the deuterium and tritium fuel and other gases to the tokamak and the recovery of tritium from all off-gases of the machine the inner fuel cycle has quite a number of additional duties. Incoming and outgoing tritium shipments need to be handled, tritium accountancy is an essential requirement and tritiated streams from sources other than the tokamak need to be processed. Not only in view of the control of effluents and releases, but also for economic incentives as much tritium as possible needs to be recovered for reuse from all off-gases and waste streams within the Tritium Plant of ITER.

The plasma exhaust gas, therefore, needs to be processed in a way that an overall tritium removal efficiency of about 10(8) is reached. Such a high decontamination factor can only be achieved by multistage processes. The third step of the three step CAPER process developed at the TLK is based on a so-called permeator catalyst (PERMCAT) reactor, a direct combination of a Pd/Ag permeation membrane and a catalyst bed. The PERMCAT principle is based on isotopic swamping in a counter current mode. Previous tritium experiments employing laboratory scale PERMCAT reactors have revealed decontamination factors as high as 10(5) for the third CAPER step. First tritium tests with a technical scale PERMCAT reactor led to similar decontamination factors and clearly demonstrated that the required overall ITER decontamination factor can be reached with a technical PERMCAT as the final clean-up step of the CAPER process.

Thus it is very difficult to foresee, without experimental data, the overall effect of these parameters. If radiolysis of pure water under gamma rays or alpha particles has been widely studied, it is not the case for self radiolysis of tritiated water (low energy P particles radiation). In order to fill this lack of experimental knowledge and to understand the radiolysis of stored tritiated water produced in tritium plants, we studied the evolution of hydrogen and oxygen concentrations in the gaseous phase above chemically pure tritiated water. The simulation of pure water radiolysis has been carried out and the results are compared with experimental data. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The main advantage of this new process is to reduce the number and/or the size of the equipment in comparison to conventional tritium removal systems. Owing to the constraints linked to tritium handling, the separation performances of several commercial hollow fiber organic membranes have been analyzed, under various operating conditions, with hydrogen/nitrogen or deuterium/nitrogen mixtures. The experiments are performed with small quantities of hydrogen or deuterium (5000 ppm). The experimental results allow to evaluate the separation efficiency of these membranes and to determine the appropriate operating conditions to apply to a membrane detritiation process.

The bipolar electrolysis process, based on isotopic separation by selective electrochemical permeation of hydrogen and its isotopes through palladium alloys membranes, could be used for isotopic enrichment of this water and for its volume reduction, together with a negligible atmospheric tritium reject. On the other hand, the treatment of highly active tritiated water, formed by direct reaction between tritium and traces of oxygen, that is trapped onto molecular sieve, requires desorption and reduction to produce tritiated hydrogen that could be treated by gas phase isotopic separation processes.

The tritium levels within the vessel have remained sufficiently high, 6.2 g at the end of the DTE1 experiment and currently 1.5 g, such that the AGHS has been required to operate continuously to detritiate gases liberated during D-D operations and to maintain discharges to the environment to ALARP. Maintaining the system to ensure continued operation has been a key factor in guaranteeing the continued availability of the essential sub-systems. The operational history of the JET AGHS has been previously documented in a number of papers [R. Lasser et al. Proc. of the 19th SOFT Conf. 1 (1996) 227; R. Lasser et al., Fusion Eng. Des. 46 (1999) 307; P.D. Brennan, et al., 18th Symp. on Fusion Eng., 1999]. Operational downtime is minimised through well-engineered sub-systems that use high integrity components. Outage, contamination and operator dosage are minimised through pre-planned and prepared maintenance operations. The reliability of sub-system critical condition fault detection is demonstrated through routine testing of hard-wired alarms and interlocks. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Operations require a diverse range of process instrumentation to carry out a multiplicity of monitoring and control tasks and approximately 500 process variables are measured. The different types and application of process instruments are presented with specially adapted or custom-built versions highlighted. Forming part of the Safety Case for tritium operations, a dedicated hardwired interlock and alarm system provides an essential safety function. In the event of failure modes, each hardwired interlock will back-up software interlocks and shutdown areas of plant to a failsafe condition. Design of the interlock and alarm system is outlined and general methodology described. Practical experience gained during plant operations is summarised and the methods employed for routine functional testing of essential instrument systems explained. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the long term, due to a 6 x 10(-16) Bq/year tritium production, Cernavoda area will be contaminated with an increasing quantity of tritium. Also, the continuous contamination of heavy water from the reactor reduces the moderator's efficiency. Therefore, the tritium concentration in the heavy water is limited to 40 Ci/kg in the moderator and 2 Ci/kg in the cooling fluid. For these reasons, we have developed a detritiation technology, based on catalytic isotopic exchange and cryogenic distillation. Tritium should be removed from the tritiated heavy water, and this will necessitate the storage of tritium in a special vessel that can provide a high level of protection and safety of environment and personnel.

The panel is of International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) relevant design in terms of geometry and dimension, coating and sorbent material. The central objective of this task is to study, for the first time in such an in-depth and parametric way, the interaction of tritium and tritiated gas mixtures with the panel, with respect to pumping performance, desorption characteristics and structural influences. This paper describes the motivation for this task and outlines the experimental aims and how they are planned to be achieved. It presents the actual status and gives a description of the test arrangement design. The paper demonstrates how the AGHS is used as a unique benchmark test bed for an ITER component to qualify ITER tritium technology. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The CP is cooled with boiling helium (He). To obtain similar conditions with the CP for hydrogen (H-2) and deuterium (D-2) pumping a lower helium panel temperature (T-HP) is required in the case of H-2. This is achieved by reducing the He boiling pressure (p(b)) and thus the He boiling temperature (T-b) via pump down of the He cryostat. The requirements are predicted by computations and verified experimentally for this case. By raising the cryostat pressure above ambient, the prediction of the H-2 end pressure (p(eH2)) of the CP could be compared with measurements in the range 5 x 10(-7)<p(eH2) (mbar) < 5 x 10(-4). The beneficial effect of argon frosting for helium pumping is only shown experimentally. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Tritium is recovered in gas phase from tritiated water and then injected in the cryogenic distillation system for further enrichment. At the Tritium Laboratory, Karlsruhe (TLK) a CECE facility is running in order to investigate the simultaneous transfer of tritium and deuterium between gas and water. Experiments are performed to determine the height equivalent of theoretical plate (HETP) and the mass transfer coefficients for deuterium and tritium.

Tritium breeding, blanket energy multiplication, and neutron transmutation of these salts were assessed. Neutron activation of FLIBE and FLINABE was evaluated and site-boundary dose due to a worst-case loss of vacuum accident was estimated. Formation of F-2, TF and T-2 during power plant operation was analyzed and issues relevant to corrosion of structural materials due to the fluorine and fluoride species was assessed. Mechanism to control the corrosion of structural materials due to TF has been identified. Depletion of LiF, BeF2, and NaF in the salts was calculated and quantities of the make-up fluorides to be added into the salts were estimated. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The use of aluminium rich coatings has been selected as reference solution for the water cooled lithium lead (WCLL) blanket in order to produce reliable tritium permeation barriers (TPB). TPB qualification activities performed in the past allowed the selection of two reference deposition techniques, the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process developed on laboratory scale by CEA, and the hot dipping (HD) process developed by FZK. On the basis of the results obtained in the past with the Corelli I-II devices, a new apparatus named Vivaldi was designed to perform comparative tests on two hollow cylindrical specimens in the same operating conditions. The performance of alumina coating on EUROFER 97 steel has been tested in gas and liquid metal phase. The obtained results in terms of permeated fluxes and permeation reduction factors (PRF) are herein presented and discussed. A post experiment examination of coatings was performed by use of optical and SEM microscopy. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In the event of plasma disruptions the values and distribution of induced currents in the breeding blanket will depend on the electrical resistivity of the adopted materials. The electrical conductivity of the insulating Be oxide layer on the pebbles surface could be significantly altered in the presence of a gamma field as well as the electrical conductivity of the purging gas present inside the Be pebble bed assembly. In this paper we report the electrical properties of Be pebble beds under an irradiation environment with a gamma radiation field ranging from 5 x 10(4) to 1.3 x 10(6) Gy/h at the Portuguese Research Reactor. Some Be pebbles were accommodated in a container where a typical purging gas of He +0.1% H-2, as foreseen in the blanket design, was introduced. The results show a decrease of the electrical resistivity values from 0.061 to 0.055 Omegam during the exposure in a gamma field of 1.3 x 10(6) Gy/h for the beds containing the purging gas mixture. The conductivity of the pebble bed without purging gas was not affected by the radiation. The results suggest that the radiation induced conductivity (RIC) was due to the ionization of the gas present in the bed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A new blanket design with mixed pebble packing of neutron multiplier and tritium breeder has been proposed to improve tritium breeding ratio (TBR). Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the compatibility between the neutron multiplier and the tritium breeder. In this study, the compatibility between Be12Ti and Li2TiO3 was investigated. The compatibility between Be and Li2TiO3 was also investigated for the comparison with the case of Be12Ti. When the Be12Ti specimen was placed in contact with Li2TiO3, neither reaction products nor diffusion of Li in beryllide were found after annealing during 1000 h at 800 degreesC. In the case of Be specimen in contact with Li2TiO3 no reaction products were observed, however, a diffusion of Li into Be was identified after annealing for more than 300 h at 800 degreesC. These results show that the compatibility of Be12Ti with Li2TiO3 was higher than that of Be, therefore, from the point of view of compatibility mixed pebble beds of neutron multiplier Be12Ti and tritium breeder Li2TiO3 pebbles can be used in a blanket.

The knowledge of Li2TiO3 pebble bed properties is necessary to design the fusion blanket. In this study, the effective thermal diffusivity of Li2TiO3 pebble bed under the neutron irradiation was evaluated. According to the irradiation test conducted in the Japan Materials Testing Reactor (JMTR), the effective thermal diffusivity of Li2TiO3 pebble bed decreased with increasing the irradiation temperature and the thermal neutron fluence. However, horizontal temperature difference (DT) was almost constant at 400 degreesC under neutron irradiation up to 1 x 10(24) n/m(2). Therefore, we can conclude that the effective thermal conductivity of Li2TiO3 pebble bed is constant for thermal neutron fluence up to 1 x 10(24) n/m(2) at least. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Beryllium metal and beryllides (Be12W, Be12Ti, Be12V, etc.) are suggested as candidate neutron multiplier materials and material property evaluations of each candidate neutron multiplier materials under neutron irradiation have been carried out. This study estimates the effect of neutron multiplier materials and the effect of the packing configuration on the TBR of the SSTR-based blanket. This work shows that the tritium-breeding ratio (TBR) in a mixed type blanket is about 1.2 times greater than that of separated type blanket. This study shows that TBR of mixed type blanket using Be12Ti or Be12V will be about 1.2 (required TBR is about 1.3), which is 90% of the TBR for a mixed type blanket using Be. It is concluded that Be12Ti and Be12V are the most promising neutron multipliers from the view of the tritium breeding. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Based on the results, the TiO2 doping (from 3.7 to 30 wt%) was found to improve the resistance to the environmental attack for very long exposure times in air at room temperature. The hydrogen reaction rates of Li2TiO3 and Li4Ti5O12 were almost similar up to 800 degreesC and that of Li4Ti5O12 was higher in the temperature range from 800 to 950 degreesC. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

An intense production of helium occurs in-pile, as well as a non negligible generation of tritium. Helium bubbles induce swelling and a high tritium inventory is a safety issue. Extensive studies for a better understanding, characterisation and modelling of the behaviour of helium and tritium in irradiated beryllium pebbles are being carried out, with the final aim to enable a reliable prediction of gas release and swelling in the full range of operating and accidental conditions of a Fusion Power Reactor. The general strategy consists in integrating studies on macroscopic phenomena (gas release) with the characterisation of corresponding microscopic diffusion phenomena (bubble kinetics) and the assessment of some fundamental diffusion parameter for the models (gas atomic diffusion coefficients). The present work gives a summary of the latest achievements in this context. By an inverse analysis of experimental out-of-pile gas release from weakly irradiated pebbles, coupled to the study of the characteristics of bubble population, it has been possible to assess the thermal diffusion coefficients of helium and tritium in and to improve and validate the classical model of gas precipitation into bubbles inside the grain. The improvement of the description of gas atomic diffusion and precipitation is the first step to enable a more reliable prediction of gas release. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The deuterium transport parameters corresponding to each phase of the composite have been derived showing the following Arrhenius tendencies for the diffusivity and solubility in the matrix: D-m (m(2)s(-1)) = 9.0 x 10(-8) exp(-39.0 (kJ mol(-1))/RT), S-m (mol m(-3)) = 1.9 x 10(5) exp(-70.7 (kJ mol(-1))/RT), and the fibre: D-f(m(2)s(-1)) = 1.6 x 10(-11) exp(-91.0 (kJ mol(-1))/RT), S-f (mol m(-3)) = 2.1 x 10(1) exp(-28.5 (kJ mol(-1))/RT), the solubilities being referred to 10(5) Pa. The different manufacturing procedures followed in the preparation of the specimens have not provoked a noticeable variation of the deuterium transport characteristics of the matrix or the fibres. The results are compared with the parameters previously obtained for different types of silicon carbide and the same material with a homogeneous transport model. The differences found are explained on the basis of the physico-chemical phenomena foreseen within its particular structure. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The present paper is focused on the study of the WCLL-TBM nuclear response in ITER-FEAT, being specifically oriented to the investigation of the local effects due to the typical C-shaped tubes of the breeder zone, since they could play a pivotal role in the module-relevant thermo-mechanical design. A 3D heterogeneous model of the WCLL-TBM, realistically simulating its new Jay out and taking into account 9% Cr martensitic steel as reference structural material, has been set-up. A particular attention has been paid to the simulation of the characteristic 'C' shape of the breeder zone double walled tubes, which have been realistically reproduced. The WCLL-TBM model has been inserted into an existing ITER-FEAT 3D semi-heterogeneous model accounting for a proper D-T neutron source. Analyses have been performed by means of MCNP-4C code running on a cluster of four workstations through the implementation of a parallel virtual machine. For each analysis a large number of histories (> 10,000,000) have been simulated, obtaining statistical uncertainties on the results lower than 3%. The main features of the WCLL-TBM nuclear response have been determined focusing the attention on power deposition density, material damage through DPA and He and H production rate, daily tritium production and tritium production rate radial distribution in the module. The obtained results are herewith presented and critically discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Agreement in general is good. The suitability of IEAF-2001 library for activation analyses in the energy domain up to 55 MeV was demonstrated with the need for improvements of some specific cross sections. Application of ALARA/IEAF-2001 to a comparative study of activation and transmutation processes in Eurofer steel irradiated in the IFMIF high flux test module and in a fusion Demo reactor first wall has shown their general similarity, the specific quantitative differences being caused by the higher neutron energies produced in IFMIF.

Both sintered blocks and pebbles have been considered and research and evaluations are underway to characterise tritium release, heat transfer, thermal-mechanical and irradiation behaviour of several material grades. The knowledge of the tritium and helium release kinetics as a function of material microstructure, neutron fluence and temperature is relevant for beryllium fusion applications. In this paper results are presented of out-of-pile annealing tests up to 1000 degreesC of S-65C beryllium grade produced by Brush Wellman and irradiated in the BR2 material testing reactor in Mol (Belgium). Together with the investigation of both tritium and helium release kinetics from the Brush Wellman beryllium, the effect of crack formation is also discussed, which eventually leads to a concurrent release of tritium and helium.

J	Aquaro, D				Aquaro, D			Thermal mechanical analysis of a solid breeding blanket	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	22nd Symposium on Fusion Technology	SEP 09-13, 2002	HELSINKI, FINLAND			pebble bed; thermal mechanical analysis; breeding blanket	BERYLLIUM PEBBLE BEDS; BEHAVIOR	This paper deals with a theoretical model of thermal mechanical behaviour of pebble beds, used as neutron multiplier or tritium breeder in the breeding blanket of a fusion nuclear reactor. The model tries to sum up the advantages of the two approaches ('discrete' method and macroscopic method), presently used for analysing the pebble bed behaviour, without their intrinsic disadvantages. The developed method has the capability to describe the microscopic behaviour of the single sphere (as the discrete approach does), and the capability to model complex structures under variable loads, typical of the macroscopic approach, without doing the unrealistic assumption of continuum homogeneous and isotropic material. The model describes the thermal mechanical behaviour of a single sphere compressed in elastic plastic conditions. The obtained relations have been extrapolated to regular lattices of spheres and subsequently to pebble beds (characterised by a macroscopic parameter called 'packing factor') of simple geometric shapes using statistical considerations. The results of the model have been assessed by comparison with results obtained by means of numerical simulations and experimental tests. The ongoing activity is the implementation in a FEM code of a new finite element, which represents one or several regular lattices of spheres, the non linear stiffness of which is obtained from the mono dimensional compression model of one sphere. The results of the numerical simulation permits to construct and display the strain and stress distribution of the single spheres by means of an implemented graphical interface.

Stoichiometric amounts of the radiation-induced defects (RD) of the electron and hole type form at radiolysis of the ceramic materials. Colloid lithium forms only in Li4SiO4 under irradiation at the temperature 423-473 K and the dose 10-20 MGy. The magnetic field increases the radiolysis efficiency by 20-25% in both materials. The efficiency of formation of RD decreases with the increasing temperature of irradiation. Complete recombination of RD takes place at 873 K. The magnetic field retards the tritium release-by lengthening the path of volume diffusion of charged tritium forms (T+). The substitution of 10 at.% of Ti4+ by Nb-5divided by produces additional cation vacancies in Li2TiO3 and increases the electrical conductivity by approximately 10 times at 1000 K. The constant of tritium diffusion is anticipated to be proportional to the electrical conductivity. The decrease of lithium content in Li2TiO3 ceramics simulating the lithium burn-up increases the electrical conductivity of ceramics. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Energy model analysis estimates the significant contribution of fusion in the latter half of the century under the global environment constraints if it will successfully developed and introduced into the market. Application to fuel production process such as hydrogen by utilizing heat is designed to increase possible contribution for energy supply further. Operation without initial tritium loading liberates fusion from fuel supply constraints, and has an effect to rapidly increase fusion share. Externality of fusion energy is analyzed by CO2 emission, impact pathway of tritium, rad-waste, and some social impacts. These results are expected to answer the questions on significance of fusion development, and improve the plant design and development strategy to maximize the benefit of fusion research.

J	Rosanvallon, S; Nordlinder, S; Fayette, L; Brunel, G				Rosanvallon, S; Nordlinder, S; Fayette, L; Brunel, G			Waste management within the framework of ITER in Cadarache	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	22nd Symposium on Fusion Technology	SEP 09-13, 2002	HELSINKI, FINLAND			ITER; waste management; decommissioning; French regulation		International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) will produce wastes both from operational activities (component replacements, process and housekeeping wastes) as well as from the decommissioning phase. Within the location of ITER in a specific site, it is necessary to review all the wastes and to determine which repository is available depending on the host country regulation criteria. The aim of this paper is, firstly, a waste classification as a function of the French categories and, secondly, the definition of the associated waste management strategy. This strategy is based on medium activity and long lived waste reduction, using, if necessary, decontamination, detritiation or radioactive decay. The 32 000 tons of wastes produced during operation (7%) and decommissioning (93%) are then distributed in 58% of very low activity wastes, 32% of low and medium activity with short half life wastes and 10% of medium activity and long half life wastes. According to the current I-D activation calculations, all the by-products of the ITER machine are manageable. Nevertheless, mixed wastes remain an important issue since toxic elements associated with nuclear wastes, such as irradiated beryllium wastes, have to be considered. A specific packaging for these wastes is being studied. The technical processes used during the operation and the de-activation periods, for decommissioning and in particular cutting, removal, cleaning operations..., are also an important issue since the classification of waste packages will depend on guarantees provided by the process as for example demonstrations on waste contamination, waste beryllium rate... Medium activity and long half life wastes are the most severe ones, independently of the chosen host country, because they require the most stringent disposal and, consequently, have a great impact on cost.
