Food samples were collected from major districts/cities of the country using the market basket method, and typical daily diets were prepared. Thorium concentration was determined by instrumental neutron activation analysis. It was found to vary from 1.6 ng g(-1) to 12 ng g(-1). The median value was 4.6 ng g(-1). This leads to median daily thorium intake of 2.7 jig d(-1). The geometric mean was 2.6 mug d(-1), which was 13% less than the ICRP value. Based on these measurements the average intake of Th-232 activity was 10 mBq d(-1), and the average annual and committed effective doses for adults were estimated to be 8.8 x 10(-7) Sv y(-1) and 4.4 x 10(-5) Sv, respectively.

J	Abelquist, EW				Abelquist, EW			Scan MDCs for multiple radionuclides in Class 1 areas	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topic; soil; sampling; radionuclides		Tire MultiAgency Radiation Survey and Site Investigation Manual (MARSSIM), published in December 1997, has been used for designing final status surveys at a number of D&D sites to date. One or tire more challenging aspects of tire MARSSIM survey design is the strategy employed when multiple radionuclides are present, particularly in Class 1 survey units. The MARSSIM recommends that potential hot spots in a Class 1 survey unit-that could exceed the derived concentration guideline levels for small elevated areas of radioactivity (i.e., DCGL(EMC))-have a reasonably good probability of being detected. Soil sampling on a specified grid size, in conjunction with gamma radiation surface scanning, is used to obtain air adequate assurance level that these hot spots are not missed daring the final status survey. Therefore, it is sometimes necessary to supplement the sample size required by the statistical test to provide additional assurance that potential hot spots of concern are detected.

J	Arana, JD				Arana, JD			MARSSIM-based graded approach for posting and controlling areas containing matrixed contamination in soil	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topic; soil; contamination; radiation protection		Controlling outdoor areas with radioactive contamination matrixed into the soil presents unique challenges to effective radiological control and environmental restoration programs. These outdoor areas, classified as either soil contamination areas (SCAs) or underground radioactive material areas (URMAs) based on the depth distribution of the contamination, constitute a large portion of the 1,517 km(2) (586 mi(2)) Hanford Site in south-central Washington state. One of the challenges in dealing with these areas is the paucity of regulatory and/or interpretive guidance, particularly with 10 CFR 835, "Occupational Radiation Protection," which does not address SCAs or URMAs. This leads to differing interpretations of applicable regulatory requirements and has caused inconsistency among the programs of various Hanford contractors. To overcome these shortfalls, the Hanford Site Environmental Restoration Contractor (ERC) developed a graded approach for posting and controlling SCAs and URMAs that is based on principles of the Multi-Agency Radiation Survey and Site Investigation Manual. This approach provides an additional degree of worker protection that exceeds the requirements or 10 CFR 835. Each step in this graded approach leads to effective environmental restoration of the Hanford Site.

COMPASS also simplifies the application of the statistical tests by performing the statistical calculations and providing prospective power curves that help in determining what level of confidence the user is willing to accept for a particular number of measurements or samples for a survey unit. After performing the final status survey, COMPASS assesses the data for comparison to the release criteria. The purpose of this article is to provide the COMPASS user with an overview of the features of the software and to demonstrate how COMPASS implements the MARSSIM guidance.

It was permanently shut down in August or 1997, and the site is currently being returned to its natural state. Guidance contained in the Multi-Agency Radiation Survey and Site Investigation Manual (MARSSIM) is being applied in preparation for the final status survey. Unlike other commercial power reactors currently undergoing decommissioning, all Big Rock Point structures will be removed prior to the final status survey. A historical site assessment along with characterization surveys formed the basis to designate 1.6 square kilometers (395.9 acres) of the site as non-impacted and the remaining 0.7 square kilometers (184.5 acres) as impacted as defined by MARSSIM. Also, a source term abstraction has been performed using historical waste stream data to identify radionuclides potentially present in site soils, hard-to-detect (HTD) radionuclides and surrogate radionuclides for the HTD radionuclides.

Unfortunately, many sites have complications that challenge a direct application of MARSSIM. Example complications include Record of Decision (ROD) requirements that are not MARSSIM-friendly, the potential for subsurface contamination, and incomplete characterization information. These types of complications are typically the rule, rather than the exception, for sites undergoing radiologically-driven remediation and closure. One such site is the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) Linde site in Tonawanda, New York. Cleanup of the site is currently underway. The Linde site presented a number of challenges to designing and implementing a closure strategy consistent with MARSSIM. This paper discusses some of the closure issues confronted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Buffalo District at the Linde site and describes how MARSSIM protocols were adapted to address these issues.

For many states, this is the case for decommissioning. Some states have reactors being decommissioned, some DOE sites undergoing cleanup, and some titanium mill or radium sites. Many, however, only occasionally do a small facility cleanup or, once in a great while, a large one. For this reason, most states participated in the readily available MARSSIM training and now recommend its use. For this same reason, the CRCPD Committee on Decontamination and Decommissioning (E24) developed a brief guidance document for state and licensee use.

The Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS) is currently decommissioning numerous plutonium contaminated facilities. The default DOE standard for unrestricted release, Order 5400.5, defines surface activity guidelines as averaged over a 1-square- meter area with a maximum value defined for any given 100-square-centimeter area. While the Order was initially developed to release property and materials from an operating site, it is restrictive in its use when performing Final Status Survey and, to date, no new complex wide standard has been developed. However, the RFETS stakeholders selected the MARSSIM, which provides a progressive method to demonstrate compliance with the defined 'dose-based" limits for a specific site, as the governing document in developing a final survey method. The end result is a hybrid final status survey plan that incorporates the requirements or both documents. This plan represents several years of development and negotiation between the contractor, the DOE, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, the Rocky Flats stakeholders, and other interested parties.			sarah.Roberts@rfets.gov					*ANL, 2001, RESRAD 6 MAN; *KAIS CO LLC, 2001, MAN27PDSP KAIS CO LL; *US DOE, 54005 US DOE; *US DOE, 1996, FIN ROCK FLATS CLEAN; *US NUCL REG COMM, 1997, NUREG1575 US NRC EPA; *US NUCL REG COMM, 1974, TERM OP LIC NUCL REA; *US NUCL REG COMM, 1998, NUREG1549 US NRC; *US NUCL REG COMM, 1992, NUREGCR5849US NRC	8	4	4	0	0	LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS	PHILADELPHIA	530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA	0017-9078	1538-5159		HEALTH PHYS	Health Phys.
