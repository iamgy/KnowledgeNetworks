In such an array, all of the individual interactions of each gamma-ray are identified by their energies and positions, the three-dimensional positions being determined by pulse-shape analysis of the signals from the segmented Ge detectors. Then, using tracking algorithms based on the properties of photoabsorption, Compton scattering and pair production, the gamma-ray scattering sequences can be reconstructed even if many gamma-rays hit the array at the same time. Such a detector will have new and much improved capabilities compared to the current generation of gamma-ray spectrometers and will be vital to fully exploit the most exotic beams from future radioactive beam facilities. One implementation of the tracking array concept, called GRETA, is currently under development in the US. In this presentation the progress of the GRETA project will be reviewed and future plans and prospects will be discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The gamma detector was designed to balance cost with maximum solid angle coverage and efficiency. To study the properties of the current design, GEANT simulations are being carried out and compared with prototype measurements using calibration sources and radioactive beams supplied by ISAC. Simulations will be compared with data allowing a realistic simulation to be produced. This modified simulation will then be used to provide efficiency predictions of the gamma array when an actual experiment's parameters are inputted. Using the simulated efficiency of the array, cross sections for radiative capture can be calculated from the measured gamma ray yields, for the individual reactions. The following will outline some initial results of background suppression of beam related experiments. Also shown, are some preliminary comparison of point source data and GEANT simulations.

Alkali-metal beams are longitudinally polarized by optical pumping of a fast atomic beam, which is created by charge exchange of the incident ion beam in a Na vapour cell. At ISAC, the beam is then reionized in a He gas target and directed to the experiments. To date, 30 keV beams of Li-8 and Li-9 have been polarized, and Li-11 and Na-20 beams are scheduled immediately following this conference. The polarization of the Li-8 beam, using a dual frequency, standing wave Ti:sapphire laser, is up to similar to80%. High polarization is achieved by matching the laser bandwidth to the energy spread in the beam. The status of the facility is reported. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Especially important for the new applications is the specific activity of the radiotracer. Conventional methods in medical isotope production have reached their technical limitations. The role of isotope separators is discussed with examples of typical production and characterization experiments conducted at the ISOLDE and TRIUMF facilities. These preliminary experiments indicate that isotope separators have a definite role to play in the future for the production of radioisotopes for biomedical research and medical application.

In 1991 the body of this man was accidentally discovered in an ice-filled depression at a high-altitude mountain pass (Tisenjoch, 3210 m) of the Otztal Alps. This location at the Austrian-Italian border apparently formed an ancient transition across the Alps from South to North. C-14 dating of the body with accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) revealed that the Iceman had lived some 5200 years ago, within the time period from 3370 to 3100 years BC (Before Christ). A variety of other materials from the discovery site were also dated with C-14 AMS suggesting a use of the mountain pass at other time periods, and varying climatic conditions. Ongoing investigations with thermal ionization (TIMS), inductively-coupled plasma (ICP-MS) and gas mass spectrometry include isotope ratios of O-18/O-16 (delta(18)O), Sr-87/Sr-86 and Pb-206/Pb-204, in order to reveal the Iceman's origin and migrational behavior. Analyzed samples include tooth enamel, bones and contents of his intestine, which all represent different ontogenetic (developmental) stages. The isotopic composition of the Iceman is compared to both soils from archaeological sites and local waters. Taken together, the results point towards an origin of the Iceman in the Southeast of the finding site, consistent with archaeological and paleobotanical data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The facility went through a major up-grade in the early 1990s with the move from the 600 MeV synchrocyclotron to the 1 GeV PS-Booster proton synchrotron. This was followed by a primary proton beam energy up grade to 1.4 GeV in 1999. Lately, an important step forward was taken with the start of the REX-ISOLDE experiment for charge breeding and post-acceleration of exotic ions. CERN has recently decided on a consolidation project for the facility to assure that the required number of shifts can be delivered in the future. An overview will be given of the on-going consolidation and development programme and its implications on the physics programme, in particular the REX-ISOLDE post-accelerator experiment. An important parameter for a better yield of very exotic elements is the primary proton beam intensity, beam energy and time structure. The possible short-term improvements of, in particular, beam intensity will be discussed in some detail. While the main effort at CERN today goes towards the completion of the LHC, some resources have been found for accelerator R&D. A possible project is a new high intensity proton source at CERN, the superconducting proton linac, which could open the door to the construction of a next generation radioactive beam facility. The possible primary beam characteristics and some design considerations and their implications for such a facility will be discussed. Some ideas for the facility itself, such as the use of antiprotons and muons as new probes, production of a neutrino beam from stored radioactive ions and a preliminary design for a low energy storage ring, will be presented.

Such beams are of interest for the creation of super-heavy elements by fusion reactions, nuclear spectroscopy of exotic nuclei, but they also have a potential for applications, e.g. in medicine. Presently the Munich research reactor FRM-II is ready for operation, but authorities delay the final permission to turn the reactor critical probably till the end of 2002. Only after this final permission the financing of the major parts of MAFF can start. On the other hand all major components have been designed and special components have been tested in separate setups. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

One important aspect concerns a new generation of high-power driver accelerators which aim at multi-megawatt beam powers, used in a two-step production scheme for fission products. Within the EURISOL study, e.g a 1 GeV, 5 mA proton has been investigated in some detail. It would be upgradeable in energy and also have, up to a certain extend, the capability for heavy-ion acceleration. The required R&D programme was assessed, and found to be in the mainstream of today's accelerator development which addresses also other projects like accelerator-driven transmutation of nuclear waste, neutrino beams,... The concomitant development of high-power spallation targets and the secondary uranium targets is the second issue where a lot of R&D effort is done by several communities. Linked to this are also the studies in which photo-fission is used as a "low-cost" option for a dedicated region of the nuclear chart. The present paper will introduce in this general context, and discuss (selected) relevant new experimental results which are obtained in linac in particular. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

RIA aims at producing intense beams of radioactive isotopes and providing them to experimental stations with energy variable from ion source energy to a few hundred MeV/u. To perform this task, RIA will use standard ISOL and fragmentation techniques together with novel approaches combining advantages of both techniques to obtain high quality beams of the produced isotopes at all energy regimes. RIA will use these approaches in combination with a novel 400 kW superconducting heavy-ion driver linac to produce the activity and a very efficient post-acceleration scheme based on low-frequency RFQs injecting an ATLAS-like superconducting linac to obtain maximum intensity and excellent beam quality at the experimental stations. The development of the RIA concept required new ideas and significant technical advances. The technical issues with this versatile high-power facility and their present solutions will be presented together with the present status of the R&D efforts and the performance obtained with various prototypes that have been completed.

The incident electron beam of 50 MeV was delivered by the LIL machine: LEP Injector Linac. The experiment allowed us to compare under the same conditions two production methods of radioactive noble gases: fission induced by fast neutrons and photo-fission. The obtained results show that the use of the electrons is a promising mode to get intense neutron rich ion beams. After the success of this photo-fission experiment, a conceptual design for the installation at IPN Orsay of a 50 MeV electron accelerator close to the PARRNe-2 device has been worked out: ALTO Project. This work has started within a collaboration between IPNO, LAL (Laboratoire de l'Accelerateur Lineaire) and CERN groups. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The finite subelement trial functions allow for explicit geometry representations within each node, thus eliminating the need for nodal homogenization. The method is implemented within the Argonne National Laboratory code VARIANT and applied to two-dimensional multigroup problems. Eigenvalue and pin-power results are presented for a four-assembly Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development/Nuclear Energy Agency benchmark problem containing enriched UO2 and mixed oxide fuel pins. Our seven-group model combines spherical or simplified spherical harmonic approximations in angle with isoparametric linear or quadratic subelement basis functions, thus eliminating the need for fuel-coolant homogenization. Comparisons with reference seven-group Monte Carlo solutions indicate that in the absence of pin-cell homogenization, high-order angular approximations are required to obtain accurate eigenvalues, while the results are substantially less sensitive to the refinement of the finite subelement grids.

In these experiments performed in the EOLE critical facility located at CEA/Cadarache, the RTC has been measured in both UO2 and UO2-PuO2 pressurized water reactor-type lattices. Our calculations have shown that the calculation error in UO2 lattices is <1 pcm/degreesC, which is considered as the target accuracy for reactor design calculations. On the other hand the calculation error in mixed oxide lattices is more significant in both low- and high-temperature ranges: An average error of -2 +/- 0.5 pcm/degreesC is observed at low temperatures, and an error of +3 +/- 2 pcm/degreesC is obtainedfor temperatures >250degreesC. Our analysis has shown that the negative error in the low-temperature range is linked to the thermal spectrum shift effect, which is strongly dependent on the thermal shapes of the cross sections of plutonium isotopes, whereas the positive error in the high-temperature range is mainly linked to the water density effects.

J	Yapici, H				Yapici, H			Determination of the optimal plutonium fraction in transuranium discharged from pressured water reactor (PWR) spent fuel for a flat fission power generation in the force-free helical reactor (FFHR) along the transmutation period	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							MIXED-OXIDE FUEL; FUSION BREEDERS; FLIBE BLANKET; NUCLEAR WASTE; DESIGN; PERFORMANCE	Transmutation of transuranium (TRU) discharged from PWR spent fuel and the possibility of a flat fission power (FFP) generation along the transmutation process have been investigated in the force-free helical reactor (FFHR), which is a demo relevant helical-type D-T fusion reactor, for an operation period (OP) of up to 10 years by 75% plant factor (11) under a neutron wall load (P) of 1.5 MW/m(2). For this purpose, the TRUs discharged from four different pressured-water reactor (PWR) spent fuels have been selected as fuel, which include minor actinides (MAs) and plutonium isotopes, and in each spent fuel, the MA has been mixed with the plutonium by using various fractions. The MA-Pu mixture has been spherically prepared, and cladded with SiC to prevent the TRU nuclides from contacting coolant and the fission products from contaminating coolant. The mixture has been located in transmutation zone (TZ) of the FFHR to incinerate and/or transmute the TRU nuclides effectively, and helium has been used for the nuclear heat transfer in the TZ. The calculations have brought out that the fission power generation profiles are quasi-linear for the mixtures with small Pu fractions, in the range of 0-30%, along the transmutation period. The optimal Pu fraction in the mixture for the FFP generation has been determined individually for each mixture by applying interpolation method to the fission rate (R-F) values obtained for the relevant mixture with various the Pu fractions along the transmutation period. In consequence of the calculations, the optimal Pu fractions are obtained as 18.94, 19.90, 18.10 and 11.85% for the fuel types A, B, C and D, respectively. In the mixture types A, B, C and D with their optimal Pu fractions, the R(F)s are quasi-constant and about 0.84, 0.73, 0.94 and 0.79, respectively. At the end of operation period (EOP), the averages of effective half-lives of Np-237, Pu-239, Pu-241, Am-241 and Am-243 can decrease to 9.8, 9.4, 9.9 and 9.6 years in the mixture types A, B, C and D, respectively. The average net transmutation fractions (TFs) for the whole TRUs and MAs are about 31 and 52%, respectively. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Mahlers, YP				Mahlers, YP			Numerical study of optimal equilibrium cycles for pressurized water reactors	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								An algorithm based on simulated annealing and successive linear programming is applied to solve equilibrium cycle optimization problems for pressurized water reactors. In these problems, the core reload scheme is represented by discrete variables, while the cycle length as well as uranium enrichment and loading of burnable poison in each feed fuel assembly are treated as continuous variables. The enrichments are considered to be distinct in all feed fuel assemblies. The number of batches and their sizes are not fixed and also determined by the algorithm. An important feature of the algorithm is that all the parameters are determined by the solution of one optimization problem including both discrete and continuous variables. To search for the best reload scheme, simulated annealing is used. The optimum cycle length as well as uranium enrichment and loading of burnable poison in each feed fuel assembly are determined for each reload pattern examined using successive linear programming. Numerical results of equilibrium cycle optimization for various values of the effective price of electricity and fuel reprocessing cost are studied. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Flibe as the main constituent is mixed with increased mole-fractions of heavy metal salt (ThF4 and UF4) starting with 2 mol% up to 12 mol%. For a plant operation period of 30 years, radiation damage values were found as DPA = similar to65 for 2 mol % heavy metal in the coolant, and remain practically constant with increasing heavy metal fraction, well below the presumable limit of DPA = 100. Helium production values are calculated as similar to270 appm for 2 mol% heavy metal fraction, also being far below the limit value of 500 appm and remain at the same level with increasing heavy metal fraction. Such a flowing protective liquid wall extents the lifetime of the rigid first wall structure to a plant lifetime of 30 years. Fissionable metal salt in the flowing liquid enables one to breed high quality fissile fuel for external reactors by a self-sustaining tritium breeding for the fusion plant and increases plant power output.

The absorbed dose delivered by the surface-coated catheter is twice that of a similar catheter filled with a solution containing the same activity of Ho-166. Leakage tests show that <0.6% of the coated activity is removable from the surface of the catheter. The coated catheter removes the risk of release of the Ho-166 into the body as a result of rupture of the balloon, and also reduces the radiation exposure to staff. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Irradiation of samples for a short time with moderated neutrons from a similar to10(7) sec(-1) Pu-Be source is used to induce 1436 keV gamma-ray emission from Cs-138. These gamma-rays are suitable for measurements; the mass of the nuclear materials is determined from the intensity of the radiation. Three series of experiments are performed with sets of samples consisting of uranium and uranium dioxide with different mass and degrees of enrichment. Experiments showed that the error in determining the mass of uranium samples can reach 1-3% with 30-60 min irradiation and the same measurement duration. Special experiments were performed to investigate the influence of the experimental geometry and the self-absorption of the gamma rays in the sample, which limit the possibility of gamma-spectrometric measurements on samples of nuclear materials. The activation gamma-spectrometric method can be used for analyzing metallic uranium samples, powder samples, samples of fuel micropellets and uranium hexafluoride, and plutonium samples.

Despite initial scepticism expressed by some experts especially about the observance of the individual dose of 20 mSv/a, application of the new regulations and the new, lower limits caused no major problems in the nuclear power plants in Switzerland. As all Swiss nuclear power plants, without exception, are seeking to modernize their facilities, keep them in excellent condition and run them without incidents, the manifold efforts within the framework of this policy taken also to achieve a high level of radiation protection have resulted in collective and individual doses being very low and any impact of plant operation on the environment or on persons, e.g. as a result of radioactive releases, being negligible.

Excesses of childhood leukaemia near certain other nuclear installations in Britain were later reported during the 1980s. Detailed radiological investigations demonstrated that radiation exposures from discharged radioactive material were most unlikely to be the cause of these excesses and no serious deficiencies in these assessments have been discovered despite exhaustive searches. In 1990, a report was published suggesting that occupational radiation exposure of men before the conception of their children could be responsible for the Seascale cluster. Extensive research has not supported a causal link between paternal preconceptional radiation dose and childhood leukaemia, and the idea that radiation exposure of fathers materially increases the risk of leukaemia in offspring and could account for the clusters has now effectively been abandoned. In contrast, evidence has mounted that childhood leukaemia has an infectious basis and that unusual population mixing increases the risk of the disease. It now seems that population mixing is the explanation for the excesses of childhood leukaemia near nuclear sites and at other locations with no enhanced exposure to radiation.

Extensive exploration of the operational window of the ITER divertor has lead to the emergence of simple scalings of the divertor plasma parameters with input power and plasma density, which are used here to make an educated guess on the divertor performance in a commercial reactor. The impact of fast transient events (ELMs), causing significant variation of the power loading, on the divertor operation and design in ITER is discussed and their implications for a reactor are shown. The issue of tritium co-deposition via hydrocarbons inside the vacuum vessel and in the pumping ducts is considered for ITER and projected to a reactor. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Nishikawa, M				Nishikawa, M			Pebble divertor concept for high power density fusion reactors	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Workshop on Innovative Concepts for Plasma-Interactive Components	MAY 23-25, 2002	OSAKA, JAPAN			steady state fusion reactor; pebble divertor; heat load; particle load; heat removal		The pebble divertor is a new concept applicable to the strike zone with very high heat ( > 20 MW/m(2)) and particle load ( > 10(24) atoms/m(2)s). In this concept, a large number of small pebbles made from refractory materials with multifunctions are used as a moving surface. A marked feature of our pebble divertor concept is the use of multi-layer pebbles. The multi-layer pebble consists of a kernel, a plasma facing layer (PFL) and an intermediate tritium permeation barrier. In the case of the pebble with a diameter of 1-2 mm, it is found that the pebble can resist high heat loads of about 30 MW/m(2). When the PFL of the pebble is made from carbon material, pebbles also perform fuel gas pumping due to the hydrogen gettering characteristic of carbon. From the estimation of the energy conversion in the pebble divertor system, the maximum operation temperature should be larger than about 800 K to obtain a energy gain, which is the ratio of recovery energy in Calnot cycle to the additional heat energy, larger than one in the divertor system.

All experiments were performed in tokamak T-11 M with main parameters: plasma current, I-p = 100 kA; duration of the discharge 0.1 s, toroidal magnetic field, B = 1 T; major radius, R = 0.7 m; minor radius, a= 0. 19-0.23 m; average electron density, n(e) similar to (1-5) x 10(19) m(-3) and electron temperature, Te(0) similar to 0.3-0.5 keV. Two moving limiters with similar geometry were installed for comparison in chamber-the conventional graphite-boron limiter and Li-limiter on the basis of capillary pore system (CPS). The Li-influx to plasma was measured by visible, UV and SX plasma emission. The main experimental results were: (a) no dramatic bursts of lithium injection at heat load close to the tokamak reactor level, similar to 10 MW/m(2), were observed, (b) the total lithium erosion from limiter can be explained by deuterium plus lithium ions sputtering (self-sputtering), (c) high lithium radiation during disruptions prevent Li-limiter from high power load, and (d) the solid basis of CPS limiter had no damages after more than 200 shots with disruptions. The main effect of lithium use in T-11 M was the rise of the first wall getter properties, i.e. recycling reduction for not only H-2 and D-2 but for He too. The temperature of hydrogen isotopes desorption was 350-400 degreesC and He desorption was 50100 degreesC. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

To handle the intense deuterium beam power up to 10 MW which corresponds to ultra high heat flux of 1 GW/m(2), the liquid Li jet flow with a maximum velocity of 20 m/s and a concave flow configuration is necessary. According to thermal-hydraulic analysis, an induced centrifugal force with a radius of concave back wall (25 cm) realized that the Li temperature is lower than the Li boiling point. To confirm the hydraulic characteristics of Li flow, water jet simulation experiment has been done. Moreover, validation experiment in Li loop is under way in Osaka University. In addition, a permissible heat load of the Li flow under a surface heat deposition has been discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The model outlined in ICRP Publication 66 represents to date one of the most complete overall descriptions of particle deposition and clearance, as well as localized radiation dosimetry, within the respiratory tract. In this study, a previous review of the ICRP-66 deposition model is extended to the study of the subsequent clearance model. A systematic review of the clearance component within the ICRP 66 respiratory tract model was conducted in which probability density functions were assigned to all input parameters for both (PuO2)-Pu-239 and (UO2)-U-238/(U3O8)-U-218. These distributions were subsequently incorporated within a computer code LUDUC (Lung Dose Uncertainty Code) in which Latin hypercube sampling techniques are used to generate multiple (e.g., 1,000) sets of input vectors (i.e., trials) for all model parameters needed to assess mechanical clearance and particle dissolution/absorption. Integral numbers of nuclear disintegrations, U-s, in various lung regions were shown to be well-described by lognormal probability distributions. Of the four extrathoracic clearance compartments of the respiratory tract, uncertainties in U-s, expressed as the ratio of its 95% to 5% confidence levels, were highest within the LNET tissues for (PuO2)-Pu-239 (ratio of 50 to 130) and within the ETseq tissues for (UO2)-U-118/(U3O8)-U-238 (ratio of 12 to 50). Peak uncertainties in 1, in these respiratory regions occurred at particle sizes of similar to0.5-0.6 mum where uncertainties in ETseq particle deposition fractions accounted for only 10% of the total Us uncertainty for (PuO2)-Pu-239, and only similar to30% of the total U-s uncertainty for (UO2)-U-238/(U3O8)-U-238 (the remainder is attributed to the clearance model alone). Of the eight clearance compartments within the thoracic regions of the respiratory tract, and for particle sizes below similar to5 mum, uncertainties in U-s were highest within the LNTH tissues for (PuO2)-Pu-239 2 (ratio of 60 to 80) and within the ETseq tissues for (UO2)-U-238/(U3O8)-U-238 (ratio of 20 and 60). At particle sizes exceeding similar to5 mum in aerodynamic diameter, peak uncertainties in U-s are noted for the AI, bb(seq), and bb(1) clearance compartments. As the particle size approaches 10 mum in size, uncertainties in U-s within these three thoracic tissue regions approach a factor of 1,000 and are dominated by corresponding uncertainties in particle deposition.

Previous papers examined uncertainties in the deposition and clearance aspects of the model. The critical parameters examined in this study included target tissue depths, thicknesses, and masses, particularly within the thoracic or lung regions of the respiratory tract. Probability density functions were assigned for the parameters based on published data. The probabilistic computer code LUDUC (Lung Dose Uncertainty Code) was used to assess regional and total lung doses from inhaled aerosols of (PuO2)-Pu-239 and (UO2)-U-238/(U3O8+)-U-238 Dose uncertainty was noted to depend on the particle aerodynamic diameter. Additionally, dose distributions were found to follow a lognormal distribution pattern. For (PuO2)-Pu-239 and (UO2)-U-238/(U3O8)-U-238 this study showed that the uncertainty in lung dose increases by factors of similar to50 and similar to70 for plutonium and uranium oxides, respectively, over the particle size range from 0.1 to 20 mum. For typical exposure scenarios involving both radionuclides, the ratio of the 95% dose fractile to the 5% dose fractile ranged from similar to8-10 (corresponding to a geometric standard deviation, or GSD, of about 1.7-2) for particle diameters of 0.1 to 1 mum. This ratio increased to about 370 for plutonium oxide (GSD similar to4.5) and to about 600 for uranium oxide (GSD similar to5) as the particle diameter approached 20 mum. However, thoracic tissue doses were quite low at larger particle sizes because most of the deposition occurred in the extrathoracic airways. For (PuO2)-Pu-239, median doses from LUDUC were found be in general agreement with those for Reference Man (via deterministic LUDEP 2.0 calculations) in the particle range of 0.1 to 5 mum. However, median doses to the basal cell nuclei of the bronchial airways (BBbas) calculated by LUDUC were found to be approximately 6 times higher than LUDEP reference doses. The higher BBbas. doses were directly attributed to discrepancies between the ICRP default thickness for the bronchial epithelium (55 mum) and the probability density function assumed within LUDUC (uniform distribution from 20 to 60 mum based upon detailed literature reviews).

J	Zhou, Y; Cheng, YS				Zhou, Y; Cheng, YS			Dose assessment for inhaling hafnium particles based on laboratory rats study	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						biokinetics; lungs; rodent; tritium; aerosols	TRITIDE PARTICLES; LUNG	Internal radiation from inhalation of hafnium tritide aerosols may be a significant radiation protection problem encountered by nuclear facility workers. Based on experimental results of the rat intratracheally instilled with hafnium tritide particles and on a self-absorption factor of beta particles determined by a numerical method, a biokinetic model was developed for inhaled particles of hafnium tritide. Results show that lung burdens of the tritide are well represented by a two-component exponential equation; biological half-lives derived for the retention of H-3 in lung were 4.9d and 1,257d for the short- and long-term clearance, respectively. The tritium clearance rate via urine or feces was described by bi-phase exponential components. At the end of the experiment (180d after instillation), only similar to30% of the initial lung burden of H-3 had been eliminated, of which similar to98% was excreted via feces and 2% in urine, but none through exhaled air. Results also showed that a large percentage (70%) of the hafnium tritide initially present in lung still remained in the organ 6 mo after the exposure. The calculation of the radiation dose indicates that the cumulative dose to the lung directly from the tritide particles was approximately 10(6) times the lung dose from the dissolved tritium in the lung region. The committed effective dose to the lung was estimated to be 5.41 x 10(-10) Sv Bq(-1), which is over 99% of that to the whole body. The dose to the liver was 6.00 x 10(-15) Sv Bq(-1). This information will be useful in developing new guidelines for radiation protection purposes.

The three areas exhibited very different Cs-137 deposition densities of 2.2 MBq m(-2), 400 kBq m(-2), and 5 kBq m(-2), respectively. During a 1-y observation, measurements of the Cs-137 transfer in the food chain to humans and Cs-137 whole body contents dependent on the Cs-137 daily intake were carried out under realistic conditions of the rural inhabitants who lived in settlements within zone II. Detailed investigations of components of the daily diet showed that the high Cs-137 contamination levels found in soils of zone II do not affect in any way low Cs-137 concentrations of all important agricultural products harvested and consumed by villagers. With regard to consumption habits of the population of zone II, mushrooms and wild berries were found to contribute more than 95% of the Cs-137 daily intake to the (CS)-C-137 whole body content of about 12 kBq (with maximum values up to 760 kBq) measured in a group of inhabitants of zone H during a period from July 1998 to July 1999. The median of the annual dose of these inhabitants from external and internal exposures was 1.2 mSv y(-1) with a geometric standard deviation of 2.6. Excluding extreme habits, the geometric mean of the total exposure was 1.0 mSv y(-1) with a geometric standard deviation of 1.3.

NORM was detected at three of the kraft mills, one sulfite mill, and none of the recycling mills. At one of the kraft mills, the NORM was associated with a commercial aluminum sulfate ("alum") slurry used on the paper machines and in intake water treatment. The maximum activity level of this alum scale was 252,000 Bq kg(-1) (6,800 pCi g(-1)) Ra-228. At two kraft mills, NORM was associated with precipitates in the bleach plant. The measured NORM activity in samples of these scales was approximately 44,400 Bq kg(-1) (1,200 pCi g(-1)) Ra-226. Where NORM was detected at a sulfite mill, the NORM deposits were found adhering tightly to the surfaces of brownstock washers. Although samples were not removed for radionuclide analysis, survey readings at the drum surface were 26 nC kg(-1) h(-1) (100 muR h(-1)) with a scintillation counter and 2,200 cpm with a Geiger-Muller counter. At all mills, exposure rate measurements and risk assessment calculations indicated that it would be highly unlikely for any worker's annual exposure to exceed 1 mSv (100 mrem) (the Nuclear Regulatory Commission limit for untrained workers) due to exposure to these materials.

During the Gulf and Balkan conflicts concern has been raised about the potential health hazards arising from the toxic and radioactive material released. The aerosol produced during impact and combustion of depleted uranium munitions can potentially contaminate wide areas around the impact sites or can be inhaled by civilians and military personnel. Attempts to estimate the extent and magnitude of the dispersion were until now performed by complex modeling tools employing unclear assumptions and input parameters of high uncertainty. An analytical puff model accommodating diffusion with simultaneous deposition is developed, which can provide a reasonable estimation of the dispersion of the released depleted uranium aerosol. Furthermore, the period of the exposure for a given point downwind from the release can be estimated (as opposed to when using a plume model). The main result is that the depleted uranium mass is deposited very close to the release point. The deposition flux at a couple of kilometers from the release point is more than one order of magnitude lower than the one a few meters near the release point. The effects due to uncertainties in the key input variables are addressed. The most influential parameters are found to be atmospheric stability, height of release, and wind speed, whereas aerosol size distribution is less significant. The output from the analytical model developed was tested against the numerical model RPM-AERO. Results display satisfactory agreement between the two models.

NIR transitions of U4+, which are not observed in spectra of brannerite, have been detected in the samples of UxTh1-xTi2O6, and we propose that strong specular reflectance is responsible for the lack of U4+ features in UTi2O6. Characteristic U5+ bands have been identified in samples in which sufficient Ca2+ has been added to nominally effect complete oxidation to U5+. XPS results support the assignments of U4+ and U5+ by DRS. The presence of residual U4+ bands in the spectra of the Ca-doped samples is consistent with segregation of Ca2+ to the grain boundaries during high temperature sintering.

J	Leenaers, A; de Tollenaere, L; Delafoy, C; Van den Berghe, S				Leenaers, A; de Tollenaere, L; Delafoy, C; Van den Berghe, S			On the solubility of chromium sesquioxide in uranium dioxide fuel	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							UO2; SYSTEM; ADDITIVES; RELEASE; CR2O3; CR	Chromium sesquioxide doped uranium dioxide systems with a variety of initially added Cr(2)O(3) amounts were prepared under different sintering conditions. The solubility limit of Cr for each sintering condition is derived from the measured content of the dopant dissolved in the UO(2) matrix using electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). It is found that the solubility of chromium in a uranium dioxide system for these series sintered at 1600, 1660 and 1760 degreesC is limited to respectively 0.065 +/- 0.002, 0.086 +/- 0.003 and 0.102 +/- 0.004 wt% Cr. The lattice parameters of the different Cr(2)O(3) doped fuels have been examined with X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD peaks of the samples sintered at 1760 degreesC as well as a UO, reference without Cr, prepared under the same conditions, were measured and a value for the lattice parameter a for each sample was obtained using the unit cell refinement method. A slight contraction of the lattice parameter is observed with increasing dopant content. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The results confirmed the absence of a direct interaction between the two compounds. The presence of strontium nitrate, however, ensured that the extent of hydrolysis and polymerisation of uranyl nitrate hexahydrate during its dehydration and decomposition to UO3 is significantly reduced. DTA curves recorded in both heating and cooling modes gave evidence to the occurrence of a reaction between molten strontium nitrate and uranium trioxide to form nitrato-complexes of uranium and strontium. X-ray diffraction data on reaction residues obtained at different temperatures and cooled to room temperature also showed evidence for the formation of such complexes. The results obtained indicated an increase in thermal stability of these nitrato-complexes with increase in Sr/U ratio. The complex with an Sr/U ratio of 2.0 is stable up to 660 degreesC and the complex with Sr/U ratio of 4.0 is stable up to 680 degreesC. These complexes decompose at higher temperatures to give strontium uranates. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Nagano, K				Nagano, K			Systems analysis of spent fuel management in Japan, (I) - Projection of material balances and storage needs	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						spentfuel; AR storage; AFR storage; material balance; simulation		Spent fuel accumulation in the future and its appropriate management strategy for Japan is analyzed by "SFTRACE" (Spent Fuel Storage, TRAnsportation and Cost Evaluation System) is introduced, which consists of 3 sub-models; (1) the economic cost data base for spent fuel storage technologies, (2) the long-range simulation of reactor mix and plutonium (Pu) utilization, and (3) the detailed simulation of spent fuel management strategies. The long-range simulation sub-model presents a macroscopic overview on how much amount of spent fuel stockpile should be addressed nationwide at a certain time point. A preliminary calculation shows that the spent fuel storage needs in Japan to the year 2050 will vary significantly, from a decrease towards zero or a continuous increase up to 20,000-25.000 tHM. The sub-model for spent fuel management simulation is the tool to demonstrate nationwide strategies to deal with spent fuel accumulation, either at each power station site or a number of centralized facilities in the given time horizon, with associated needs of transportation. An illustrative analysis shows trade-off relationship among factors involved in spent fuel management strategies, such as between "away from reactor (AFR)" storage capacity and overall transportation requirements, which vividly demonstrates the usefulness of the integrated analytic tool.

Laboratory-scale leaching tests were performed for radioactive and non-radioactive waste specimens simulating bituminized waste of a French reprocessing company. COGEMA. The Simulated waste was contacted with deionized water, an alkaline Solution (0.03-mol/l KOH), and a saline solution (0.5-mol/l KCl) under atmospheric and anoxic conditions. The concentrations of Na, Ba, Cs, Sr, Np, Pu, NO3, SO4 and I in the leachates were determined. Swelling of the bituminized waste progressed in deionized water and KOH. The release of the soluble components. Na and Cs, was enhanced by the swelling, and considered to be diffusion-control led in the swelled layers of the specimens. The release of sparingly soluble components such as Ba and Np was solubility-limited in addition to the progression of leaching. Neptunium, a redox-sensitive element, showed a distinct difference in release between anoxic and atmospheric conditions. The elemental release from the bituminized waste specimens leached in the KCl was very low, which is likely due to the suppression of swelling of the specimens at high ionic strength.

The unit has 350 mm of thickness and 690mm of width and distance between those two units was adjustable from 0 to 1,450 mm. Condition of the solution was about 290 gU/l in uranium concentration, about 0.8 N in free nitric acidity, 24-27degreesC in temperature and about 1.4 g/cm(3) in solution density. The reactivity effect was estimated from variation of critical solution level from 495 to 763 rum depending on the core distance. The reactivity effect was also evaluated by the solid angle method and a computational method using the continuous energy Monte Carlo code MCNP-4C and the nuclear data library JENDL 3.2. Those estimations were compared and the distance to isolate neutron interaction was overestimated by the solid angle method. The computational method considering neutron reflection from surrounding structures reproduced well the isolation distance given by the experiment.

In the case of large facilities that reprocess spent fuel, it is anticipated that the MB measurement uncertainty will be too large to meet statistical loss detection goals. Nonetheless, many believe that large reprocessing facilities can be effectively safeguarded with an appropriate combination of monitoring, MB accounting, and containment/surveillance (C/S) measures. We anticipate that solution monitoring (SM) will be a challenging but extremely useful new safeguards monitoring measure. This paper investigates how SM could improve loss detection in a formal statistical sense and discusses qualitative safeguards benefits of SM.

In the past, programmes, projects or policies were judged and assessed on a single criterion-finance-or, at best, on a very limited set of criteria and managed on an informal, intuitive basis. That simplistic approach currently falls short of expectations of the public or the demands of the present-day projects where complexity and diversity have grown enormously and the decision criteria have become multifarious. This MUA technique helps to analyse decision alternatives on a multi-criteria basis and ranks them from the most preferred to the least preferred for easier assimilation by decision-makers. The technique was used by the US Department of Energy in the mid-1980s in selecting suitable site(s) out of five nominated sites for the disposal of high-level radioactive wastes. It is increasingly being used by national organisations in the UK and abroad.

The coolant flow rate provides part of the reactivity control mechanism. The TRISO-coated particles have an enriched uranium oxide kernel surrounded by layers of porous carbon, pyrolytic carbon and silicon carbide. This paper presents detailed transient modelling results of this conceptual fluidised bed thermal nuclear reactor obtained using the FETCH nuclear criticality model. Previous work has provided evidence to suggest that such a reactor can be dynamically stable for low power outputs of similar to20 MWt. This work focuses on a reactor with a much higher thermal output of 100 MWt. To simulate the fluidised bed reactor the FETCH model has been used to solve the neutron transport equation in full-phase space, coupled to multi-phase gas-particle fluid dynamics. The main difficulty in modelling such a reactor is that its reactivity is a sensitive function of the fuel particle distribution inside the inner fluidised bed reactor cavity. This fuel particle distribution varies chaotically with time which is the root cause of the reactor's power variability.
