J	Rosenberger, S				Rosenberger, S			Reducing liquid waste processing costs and clean liquid waste to the detection limits	NUCLEAR ENERGY-JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH NUCLEAR ENERGY SOCIETY			English	Reprint						innovative technologies; plant modification; waste management & disposal		Following deregulation of the US energy market, the past decade has seen increased competition in energy sales and a compression in the numbers of operators on a scale not witnessed hitherto in that country. This situation has inevitably put pressure on nuclear operators to become ever-more efficient and cost-effective. This paper describes the status of an innovative development in radioactive liquid waste processing that was triggered by this general development in the US commercial nuclear industry.

J	Han, KH; Chang, SH				Han, KH; Chang, SH			Development of a thermal-hydraulic analysis code for annular fuel assemblies	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								A thermal-hydraulic analysis code which is capable of modeling both internally and externally cooled annular fuel pins was developed. The coolant flow distribution in the annular fuel-based assemblies is adjusted by a pressure drop model allowing for conditions such as non-equal velocity and non-saturated phases. The heat transfer fraction is determined by the ratio of cross-sectional areas distinguished by the radius at which the first derivative of the temperature within the annular fuel equals zero. The code predictions have been compared with calculations from Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) and MIT. The heat transfer fraction difference between the code and RELAP was about 3.9%, and the Departure from Nucleate Boiling Ratio (DNBR) prediction of the code agreed well with the MIT's result in the region below 3 m. For the application of the code, thermal-hydraulics of thorium-based fuel assemblies loaded with annular seed pins were compared with those of the existing thorium-based assemblies. The pressure drop in the assembly generally increased in the case of annular fuel due to the larger wetted perimeter. In the inner subchannels of the seed pins, mass fluxes were high due to the grid form losses in the outer subchannels. About 43% of the heat generated from the seed pin flowed into the inner subchannel and the rest into the outer subchannel. The minimum DNBRs (MDNBRs) of the annular fuel-based assemblies were higher than those of the existing ones. Because interchannel mixing cannot occur in the inner subchannels, temperatures and enthalpies were higher in the inner subchannels. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Watson, JHP; Ellwood, DC				Watson, JHP; Ellwood, DC			The removal of the pertechnetate ion and actinides from radioactive waste streams at Hanford, Washington, USA and Sellafield, Cumbria, UK: the role of iron-sulfide-containing adsorbent materials	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							RAY-ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY; SULFATE-REDUCING BACTERIA; TECHNETIUM; ADSORPTION; BEHAVIOR; METALS; FES; TC	In previous work the adsorption of a number of radioactive ions from solution by a strongly-magnetic iron sulfide material has been studied. The material was produced by sulfate-reducing bacteria in a novel bioreactor. The uptake is rapid and the loading on the adsorbent is high due to the high surface area of the adsorbent and because many of the ions are chemisorbed. The structural properties have been examined using high-resolution imaging and electron diffraction, by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The magnetisation versus field and temperature, extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy and neutron diffraction have been reported previously. The surface area is of the order of 400-500 m(2) g(-1), as determined by the adsorption of heavy metals, the magnetic properties, neutron scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Following the success of the biologically-generated material, Lidzey at Bio Separation Ltd. was able to produce an iron sulfide material with the tochilinite structure which has similar adsorption properties for cations, but not anions. as the biologically-generated material but the Lidzey material is considerably cheaper to produce. One of the radionuclides of particular interest is the pertechnetate ion TcO4 (-). Tc-99 is a radionuclide determining the long-term environmental impact of the nuclear fuel cycle because of its long half-life and because it occurs normally in the form of the highly soluble pertechnetate ion which can enter the food chain. This paper examines methods by which adsorbent materials containing iron sulfide can play a part in the extraction and the safe long-term storage of many radionuclides and in particular the pertechnetate ion occuring at the Hanford Plant, Washington, USA and the Sellafield Plant, Cumbria, UK.

We have considered two typical examples of radiotracers that will be available in KEK-JAERI RNB facility, F-18 (half-life: 1.8 h, beta(+)-emitter) and Li-8 (half-life: 0.83 s, alpha-emitter). The sample is set on a given temperature and irradiated by the tracer beams for a time-duration. In the case of F-18, the serial sectioning technique by the ion-beam-sputtering device is assumed to obtain the concentration-depth profile of the tracer diffused during the irradiation time. In the case of Li-8, the simulation reveals that the time-dependent yields of a particles can be used as a measure of the diffusivity of the tracer in a non-destructive way. The present method could be applied to measure rather large diffusion coefficients of various radiotracers with a short measuring time. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Peterson, PF				Peterson, PF			Multiple-reheat Brayton cycles for nuclear power conversion with molten coolants	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						power conversion; Brayton cycle; molten coolants	EFFICIENCY; SYSTEM	Gas-turbine power conversion systems can have lower capital costs than comparable steam-turbine systems due to their higher power density. The recent commercialization of magnetic bearing systems for large turbomachinery now makes direct recuperated Brayton cycles the preferred power conversion choice for gas-cooled reactors. This paper presents a multiple-reheat closed gas cycle optimized to use energy input from liquid-metal or molten-salt coolants with temperatures as low as 550 to 650degreesC By utilizing reheat, these molten coolant gas cycles (MCGCs) have the potential for substantially higher thermal efficiency than current gas-cooled reactors if used with comparable turbine inlet temperatures. The MCGC system also eliminates the need for steam generators, which removes the potential for chemical reactions between the molten coolant and steam, and greatly simplifies the control of tritium for fusion energy systems.

Depending on the case, such an approach could be wrong for nitrate solutions. Seven components are concerned: UO2(NO3)(2), U(NO3)(4), Pu(NO3)(4), Pu(NO3)(3), Th(NO3)(4), Am(NO3)(3), and HNO3. To obviate this problem, a new methodology based on the thermodynamic concept of mixtures of binary electrolytes solutions (one electrolyte + water) at constant water activity, a so-called "isopiestic" solution, has been developed by the Institute de Radioprotection et de Surete Nucleaire (IRSN) to calculate the nitrate solutions density. This paper presents its qualification by using criticality experiments. The theory and the implementation are also given. Qualification results of the uranyl and plutonium nitrate solutions show that the new density law (also called the isopiestic law) is in good agreement with the benchmarks. Thus, no bias is put into evidence for the uranium solutions, and a small negative bias equal to 0.2% is found for the plutonium solutions. Moreover, the isopiestic law corrects the observed 1% overestimation of k(eff) due to the empirical IRSN Leroy and Jouan density law for uranium solutions and the observed 3.4% underestimation of keff due to the ARH-600 density law for plutonium solutions. The isopiestic density law has been implemented in CIGALES V2.0, the graphical user interface of the French criticality safety package CRISTAL that calculates the atom densities of nuclides (and writes the input file for CRISTAL computations).

J	Ueda, Y; Ishii, J; Matsumoto, S				Ueda, Y; Ishii, J; Matsumoto, S			Effect of entrainment and overflow occurrences on concentration profile in PUREX flow sheet	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						PUREX process; abnormal flow; concentration profile		A deviation in the operational condition of a mixer settler and a centrifugal contactor causes an entrainment or an overflow, which affects the concentration profile. Although there has been no quantitative study about the effect of such abnormal flows on the concentration profile, the occurrence of such abnormal flows has been severely restricted for a PUREX flow sheet. However, the restriction of abnormal flows can be relaxed when the effect of such flows is limited within the allowable range such that the concentration of the product does not deviate from its specification. This relaxation could serve to benefit a continuous operation under a certain degree of deviation from the operational condition and a smaller design load of a solvent extractor. From this viewpoint, the relationship between the magnitude of abnormal flows and the effect of them on the process was studied quantitatively using a specially developed code in a wide range of PUREX flow sheet conditions, and the possibility of this relaxation was investigated. The results showed that the effect of the abnormal flow on the concentration in the organic outflow or aqueous raffinate was dominated by the leakage fraction under normal conditions regardless of each specific flow sheet condition. The common correlations were found between the leakage fraction of uranium and plutonium under the occurrence of abnormal flows and that under no abnormal flow for the stripping and extracting conditions, respectively. Comparing the given correlations and the usual specification of the leakage fraction of uranium and plutonium suggested that the restriction of the abnormal flows could be relaxed for a usual PUREX flow sheet.

This study involves a selection of a series of parameters including proton energy, target thickness, and irradiation time that will maximize the yield of the product and minimize the radioactive impurities. The excitation functions of the (TI)-T-203(p,xn)Pb reactions have been calculated by using the ALICE-91 and FLUKA codes, respectively. Their results were compared with that recommended in the IAEA-TECDOC-1211 report. The discrepancies among them were identified and the resulting effects on the integral yields were discussed. Based on the recommended nuclear data, a user-friendly program has been developed to estimate the activities of the product and impurities during the production process of (TI)-T-201 in INER's compact cyclotron (INERCC). This helps in understanding the effects of various parameters selected in the production process. The results reveal that the current status of the production process of (TI)-T-201 in INERCC appears to be quite optimal and the production yield is close to its theoretical prediction.

The detector processing and oxygen enrichment were carried out in a common project by the Institute of Micro-sensors CiS using n-type high-resistivity FZ silicon (3-6 kOmega cm) with <111> and <100> orientation. Different oxygen concentrations were achieved by diffusion at 1150degreesC for 24, 48 and 72 h. This report on bulk damage effects is focussed on the observed changes in the reverse current, the effective space charge density N-eff extracted from C/V measurements and investigations using the transient current technique. A substantial improvement of radiation hardness concerning the development of the macroscopic properties was found for detectors manufactured on oxygenated material compared to standard material. It will be demonstrated that the change of the effective space charge density as well as the increase of the reverse current can be attributed to the creation of two deep acceptor levels and a shallow donor level.

Surface reactions alter and erode the UO2 particles. This paper outlines results for measurements of oxidation rates on uranium oxide particles using in situ photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). Phosphorescence spectra observed during oxidation of UO2+x were attributed to U(VI) in uranyl-type coordination and in octahedral coordination. Uranyl-type spectra formed during wet oxidation of UO2+x, and U(VI) octahedral spectra formed during dry oxidation of UO2+x. The uranyl-type species, although more stable, is more kinetically labile for vacuum reduction than is the octahedral U(VI). Oxidation of U(IV) species are diffusion controlled. Vacuum reduction of uranyl U(VI) in UO3 follows a field-enhanced cationic diffusion rate law, while re-oxidation follows a diffusion rate law. Post-oxidation core and valence band XPS and SIMS measurements provided qualitative and quantitative measures of uranium oxidation states near uranium oxide surfaces. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

When the U-7wt%Mo alloy was previously homogenized and the gamma(U, Mo) phase was retained, the formation of (U, Mo)Al-3 and (U, Mo)Al-4 was observed at 580 degreesC. Also a very thin band was detected close to the Al side, the structure of the ternary compound Al20UMo2 might be assigned to it. When the decomposition of the gamma(U, Mo) took place, a drastic change in the diffusion behavior was observed. In this case, XRD indicated the presence of phases with the structures of (U, Mo)Al-3, Al43U6Mo4, gamma(U, Mo) and alpha(U) in the reaction layer. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The ceramics were prepared by coprecipitation of Zr, Th and U salts. In this study, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques such as energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) complement X-ray diffraction, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES), techniques to reveal the phase structure and chemistry. The results from XRD and EDX show that these ceramics separate into a Zr-based phase and an actinide-based phase with low mutual affinity of Th and Zr, as well as partial solubility of U in Zr.

The experiments were conducted in LiCl-KCl eutectic at 550 degreesC and NaCl-KCl equimolar mixture at 750 degreesC. The behavior of the following individual elements was investigated: Cs, Mg, Sr, Ba, lanthanides (La to Dy), Zr, Cr, Me, Mn, Re (to simulate Tc), Fe, Ru, Ni, Cd, Bi and Te. Lithium and sodium phosphates were used as precipitants. The efficiency of the process and the composition of the solid phases formed depend on the melt composition. The distribution coefficients of these elements between chloride melts and precipitates were determined. Some volatile chlorides were produced and rhenium metal was formed by disproportionation. Lithium-free melts favor formation of double phosphates. Some experiments in melts containing several added fission product elements were also conducted to study possible co-precipitation reactions. Rare earth elements and zirconium can be removed from both the systems studied, but alkaline earth metal fission product elements (Sr and Ba) form precipitates only in NaCl-KCl based melts. Essentially the reverse behavior was found with magnesium. Some metals form oxide rather than phosphate precipitates and the behavior of certain elements is solvent dependent. Caesium cannot be removed completely from chloride melts by a phosphate precipitation technique. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Janney, DE				Janney, DE			Host phases for actinides in simulated metallic waste forms	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							STEEL-ZIRCONIUM ALLOYS; MAGNETIC-PROPERTIES; LAVES PHASES; ZR ALLOY; MICROSTRUCTURE; TECHNETIUM; SYSTEM	Argonne National Laboratory has developed an electrometallurgical process for conditioning spent sodium-bonded metallic reactor fuel prior to disposal. A waste stream from this process consists primarily of stainless steel cladding hulls containing undissolved metal fission products and a low concentration of actinide elements. This waste will be immobilized in a metallic waste form whose baseline composition is stainless steel alloyed with 15 wt% Zr (SS-15Zr). This paper presents transmission electron microscope, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and electron diffraction observations of SS-15Zr alloys containing 2-11 wt% U, Np, or Pu. The major U- and Pu-bearing materials are Cr-Fe-Ni-Zr intermetallics with structures similar to that of the C15 polymorph of Fe2Zr, significant variability in chemical compositions, and 0-20 at.% actinides. A U-bearing material similar to the C36 polymorph of Fe2Zr had more restricted chemical variability and 0-5 at.% U. Uranium concentrations between 0 and 5 at.% were observed in materials with the Fe23Zr6 structure. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

MCNP code calculations were combined with burnup measurements to determine linear heat rating of the test fuel pins. To identify the axial incipient melting positions corresponding to the power-to-melts, solidified grain morphology and molten fuel axial movements were characterized. Extensive observations on longitudinal ceramographs allowed classifying molten fuel settlements near bottom and top extents of axial fuel melting into three types. The power-to-melts depended slightly on fuel-to-cladding gap sizes and clearly on both oxygen-to-metal ratios and densities of fuel pellets. These dependencies resulted from the fuel pellet cracking and relocation behavior, which fairly improves heat transfers across the gaps. Also, the power-to-melt at the bottom position was higher than that at the top position due to an axial gradient of cladding temperatures in each fuel pin. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the behavior of tritium on SiC has not been discussed yet. In this study, tritium trapping capacity on the surface of SiC was experimentally obtained at the temperature range of 25-800 degreesC in consideration of tritium trapping to the experimental system. The capacity, which was independent of the water vapor pressure in the gas phase and the temperature, was determined as about 10(6) Bq/cm(2). The isotope exchange reaction rate between tritiated water in a gas phase and hydrogen on the surface was quantified at the temperature of 25, 500 and 700 degreesC in consideration of the behavior of tritium trapping at change of experimental condition by the numerical curve fitting method applying the serial reactor model. The reaction rate was observed to be constant as 3.48 x 10(-5) m/s. Additionally tritium release behavior from the surface of SiC in water vapor atmosphere was predicted and compared with that for graphite and stainless steel. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Time resolution similar to20 ps (10-30 GHz), energy discrimination, and significant stand off distance may be needed for credible burn history measurements. The 16.75 MeV gamma rays that accompany deuterium-tritium (d + t) fusion provide a high-bandwidth alternative to 14 MeV fusion neutrons for d + t burn-history measurements. A thresholding detector, based on the Cherenkov effect, resulting from Compton and pair production electron interactions in gaseous carbon dioxide, offers a means of separating the high-energy fusion gamma rays from other background sources. When coupled to appropriate streak camera recorders, a gas Cherenkov system response of 15 GHz is feasible. As a first step toward this goal, a gas Cherenkov system, employing a I GHz photodiode detector, was fielded at the Omega laser facility to demonstrate unambiguous detection of fusion gamma rays from high-yield d + t implosions. With the carbon dioxide Cherenkov production threshold at 12 MeV, the observed high-energy gamma-ray signal is proportional to the observed 14 MeV fusion neutron yield and independent of neutron-induced gamma rays.

J	Ene, D				Ene, D			Safety studies related to the spent fuel storage of the Romanian VVR-S reactor	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								The paper presents the methods developed and calculations carried out, using the SCALE4.3 code system to analyse the possibility of safe storage of the Romanian VVR-S reactor spent fuel load inside the CASTOR MTR2 cask. A method has been developed to derive specific p robl em-dependent nuclear libraries, defined for groups of fuel assemblies. The SAS2H calculation module has been used to simulate different irradiation histories of all spent fuel assemblies and to process the resulting libraries for input to ORIGEN-S code depletion-decay calculations. Using this procedure the characteristics of the spent fuel assemblies for six cooling times have been calculated. Obtained results are presented and discussed in the paper. The CSAS6 module with KENO-VI criticality code based on the 44-group energy cross-sections library has been used to solve criticality aspects. Some relevant problems to justify the calculation model have been studied and are presented in the paper. The sequence SAS4 with MORSE, a Monte Carlo code based on the (27n-18g)-coupled group energy cross-sections, has been used for solving the shielding problem. Gamma and neutron dose rates estimated on the surface of the container, and respectively at I m, 2 m, and 3 m in both radial and axial directions for normal loading, and for audit conditions are presented and discussed.

J	Slessarev, I; Bokov, P				Slessarev, I; Bokov, P			On potential of thermo-nuclear fusion as a candidate for external neutron source in hybrid systems (applied to the "WISE" concept)	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								The WISE (Waste-free, Intrinsically Safe, and Efficient) concept, based on the sequent application first natural U and then Th liquid fuel (molten salt, liquid metals, etc.), seems to be particularly attractive for Nuclear Power (NP) both for transmutation of wastes and for long-term energy production. However, the use of natural thorium fuel as well as of "once-through fuel cycle" make neutronics of WISE-core particularly weak and it requires a significant external neutron Source to support sub-critical cores. Traditionally, spallation reactions have been considered as a potential source in Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS), although an important fraction of elaborated power must be spent to feed the corresponding powerful accelerators. Fusion types of the external neutron source, if they are relatively small and economically viable, can allow to get more advantages of WISE concept. The general analysis, given in this paper, shows that a fusion source is a real alternative to a spallation type of neutron source for multiple hybrid applications. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Kloosterman, JL				Kloosterman, JL			Application of boron and gadolinium burnable poison particles in UO2 and PUO2 fuels in HTRs	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							REACTIVITY	Burnup calculations have been performed on a standard HTR fuel pebble (fuel zone with radius of 2.5 cm surrounded with a 0.5 cm thick graphite layer) and burnable poison particles (BPPs) containing B4C made of pure B-10 or containing Gd2O3 made of natural Gd. Two types of fuel were considered: UO2 fuel made of 8% enriched uranium and PuO2 fuel made of plutonium from LWR spent fuel. The radius of the BPP and the number of particles per fuel pebble were varied to find the flattest reactivity-to-time curve. For the UO2 fuel, the reactivity swing is lowest (around 2%) for BPPs made of B4C with radius of 75 pm. In this case around 1070 BPPs per fuel pebble are needed. For the PuO2 fuel to get a reactivity swing below 4%, the optimal radius of the BPP is the same, but the number of particles per fuel pebble should be around 1600. The optimal radius of the Gd2O3 particles in the UO2 fuel is about 10 times that of the B4C particles. The reactivity swing is around 3% when each fuel pebble contains only 9 BPPs with radius of 840 mum. The results of the Gd particles illustrate nicely the usage of black burnable poison particles introduced by Van Dam [Ann. Nuclear Energy 27 (2000) 733]. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Sailerova, E; Billinghurst, MW				Sailerova, E; Billinghurst, MW			A study of factors affecting the labelling of tartrate with Re-188 and the transchelation of the Re-188 from the tartrate to a protein	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						rhenium-188; perrhenate; ascorbate; radiolysis; tartrate; transchelation	GENERATOR; RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS	The formation of Re-188-tartrate for use in transchelation reactions and the transchelation of the Re-188 onto albumin was studied. Two labelled tartrate products were separated using a non-traditional mobile phase on ITLC strips. Tartrate labelling yield increases with pH but so does the instability when the product is exposed to air. Lower pH's are preferred when oxygen-free labelling conditions can be achieved. Higher tin levels protect against air oxidation. Stability of the Re-tartrate complex is supported by addition of ascorbic acid and ferrous sulphate, however both these agents decreased the rate of the formation of the Re-tartrate complex. The labelling efficiency of a perrhenate solution decreased with the time for which it is stored prior to the labelling reaction, depending on the radioactive concentration. Re-albumin transchelation efficiency increases with the tartrate concentration, while increased stability of the Re-tartrate complex lowers the transchelation yields of Re-albumin.

The marble and ceramic tiles did not show detectable radon exhalation using the active radon gas analyzer system. However the granite tiles showed relatively high radon exhalations, indicating a relatively high uranium content. A comparison of the radon exhalation rates measured by the two techniques showed a linear correlation coefficient of 0.57. The radon exhalation rates from the granites varied from 0.02 to 6.58 Bq m(-2) h(-1) with an average of 1.35 +/- 1.40 Bqm(-2) h(-1). The geometric mean and the geometric standard deviation of the frequency distribution were found to be 0.80 and 3.1, respectively. The track density found on the nuclear track detectors in the can technique exposed to the granites, having high exhalation rates, varied linearly with exposure time with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.99. This experimental finding agrees with the theoretical prediction. The can technique showed sensitivity to low radon exhalation rates from ceramic, marble and some granite over a period of 2 months, which were not detectable by the active radon gas analyzer system. The reproducibility of data with both measuring techniques was found to be within a 7% deviation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Oral administration of a known quantity of radioiodine to patients requires accurate radioactivity measurements to be performed on a well-calibrated isotope calibrators. Under or over estimation of the activity due to a faulty or uncalibrated isotope calibrator could provide misleading results. Calibration of isotope calibrators and the traceablity of subsequent measurements to the national standards laboratory is one of the essential basic radiation safety requirement of the IAEA. In view of the stringent quality assurance requirements for activity measurements imposed by Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, a National Intercomparison Program was initiated and to date ten such intercomparison programs have been conducted by the Radiation Safety Systems Division, of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. This program has benefited the participants by making their measurements traceable to the National Primary Standards. Over the years there has been a marked increase in the number of NMCs participating in the intercomparison programs. As a result, the number of institution showing large deviation from the correct value has decreased considerably over the years. This program thus, has enabled participating NMCs to check their isotope calibrators so as to ensure proper delivery of radiation dose to the patients and hence to optimise patient exposure.

J	Kotov, VM; Kotov, SV; Tikhomirov, LN				Kotov, VM; Kotov, SV; Tikhomirov, LN			Possibility of building a thermal nuclear reactor with total utilization of the initial uranium and thorium	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								It is shown that total Utili7 tion of the natural stocks of uranium and thorium is possible in thermal nuclear reactors. The technology is based on eliminating parasitic neutron absorption in Xe-135, using cyclic operation of the fuel elements in the reactor In addition, neutron losses in the production chains of fissioning materials are smaller and fissioning materials, especially U-233, are put into active operation more quickly. The advantages of cyclic transposition can be fully realized by using the core superposition method. In this method, the excess neutrons front a part of the core where the reactivity is positive are directed into a Zone with a high breeding ratio and negative reactivity. Fuel based on natural uranium permits using up to 18% of the initial material with recycling. Adding more than 20% Th-232 to the initial material permits total utilization of Th-232 and U-238 in the recycling regime.								*AT EN MIN RUSS FE, 2000, STRAT DEV NUCL POW R; GALANIN AD, 1984, INTRO THEORY THERMAL, P350; Ponomarev-Stepnoy N.

The method is based on calculating the number of elementary separation effects produced by the separation apparatus. Relations are found for the potential which contain arbitrary constants that depend on the special features of the separation process under study. In a particular case, the solution obtained corresponds to Smorodinskii's formula. The practical application of various forms of the potential is analyzed. The form of the potential suitable for enrichment of target isotopes is established. Recommendations are made for estimating the separation efficiences for elements, steps, and cascades.

J	Guldner, R				Guldner, R			Potential of light water reactors for future nuclear power	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article								Energy consumption worldwide is going to increase further in the next few decades. Reliable supplies of electricity can be achieved only by centralized power plant structures. In this scenario, nuclear power plants are going to play a leading role as reliable and competitive plants, also under deregulated market conditions. Today, light water reactors have achieved a leading position, both technically and economically, contributing 85% to worldwide electricity generation in nuclear plants. They will continue to be a proven technology in power generation. In many countries, activities therefore are concentrated on extending the service life of plants beyond a period of forty years. New nuclear generating capacities are expected to be created and added from the end of this decade onward. Most of this capacity will be in light water reactors. The concepts of third-generation reactors will meet all economic and technical safety requirements of the 21st century and will offer considerable potential for further development. Probably some thirty years from now, fourth-generation nuclear power plants will be ready for commercial application. These plants will penetrate especially new sectors of the energy markets. Public acceptance of new nuclear power plants is not a matter of reactor lines, provided that safety requirements are met. The important issue is the management of radioactive waste. The construction of new nuclear power plants in Western Europe and North America mainly hinges on the ability to explain to the public that there is a need for new plants and that nuclear power is fundamental to assuring sustainable development.

J	Sullivan, P				Sullivan, P			Approach to customer qualification of the BNFL Sellafield Mox Plant	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article								BNFL started plutonium commissioning of its Sellafield MOX Plant (SMP) in December 2001, with the first MOX pellets being produced in May 2002. SMP was designed to manufacture a range of both PWR and BWR fuel types for a number of different customers. During commissioning and early MOX fuel manufacturing BNFL has been demonstrating its ability to both automatically manufacture and inspect MOX fuel to meet the requirements of different customers' specifications and fuel types. The qualification project consisted of common and project specific qualification. Common qualification was carried out to demonstrate BNFL could meet several customers' requirements during the same qualification test. Project specific qualification was carried out for one customer only as the fabrication or inspection equipment was specific to their fuel type. An example is the fuel assembly process. The reasons for BNFL carrying out common qualification were: Develop a common qualified process to meet different customer specifications. Minimise future qualifications prior to starting future fuel campaigns. Ensure BNFL understands and effectively manages different customer requirements in SMP. BNFL has approached qualification of SMP systematically. Firstly the inspection system was qualified, and once completed, the inspection system was then used in the qualification of the manufacturing process.

J							Internationale Landerkommiss Kerntech	ILK statement on the recommendations by the working group on procedures for the selection of repository sites	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								The Working Group on Procedures for the Selection of Repository Sites (AkEnd) had been appointed by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment (BMU) to develop procedures and criteria for the search for, and selection of, a repository site for all kinds of radioactive waste in deep geologic formations in Germany. ILK in principle welcomes the attempt on the part of AkEnd to develop a systematic procedure. On the other hand, ILK considers the two constraints imposed by BMU inappropriate: AkEnd was not to take into account the two existing sites of Konrad and Gorleben and, instead, work from a so-called white map of Germany. ILK recommends to perform a comprehensive safety analysis of Gorleben and define a selection procedure including the facts about Gorleben and, in addition, to commission the Konrad repository as soon as possible. The one-repository concept established as a precondition by BMU greatly restricts the selection procedure. There are no technical or scientific reasons for such concept. ILK recommends to plan for separate repositories, which would also correspond to international practice. The geoscientific criteria proposed by AkEnd should be examined and revised. With respect to the site selection procedure proposed, ILK feels that that procedure is unable to define a targeted approach. Great importance must be attributed to public participation. The final site selection must be made under the responsibility of the government or the parliament.

J	[Anonymous]				[Anonymous]			ITU turns forty - European nuclear research as a public service	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								After several years of preparation, the first wings of the building of the Institute for Transuranium Elements (ITU) in Karlsruhe were completed and commissioned in December 1963. This marks the beginning, forty years ago, of an important international research establishment. The Institute studies possible technical applications of elements beyond uranium in the Periodic Table, and conducts comprehensive environmental and safety studies in connection with handling these substances. The Institute is a facility of the Joint Research Center (JRC) of the European commission, which runs other laboratories in Ispra, Petten, Geel, and Sevilla. Current multidisciplinary research projects concentrate on the management and treatment of radioactive waste; forensic technology based on nuclear science; radiation protection; the detection of radioactivity in the environment; and the use of radioactive isotopes in nuclear medicine. In addition, ITU contributes significantly to the identification of nuclear material in cooperation with European and international organizations, thus contributing to the fight against illegal trafficking in nuclear material as well as supporting safeguards missions.									0	0	0	0	0	VERLAGSGRP HANDELSBLATT GMBH	DUSSELDORF	POSTFACH 10 11 02, D-40002 DUSSELDORF, GERMANY	1431-5254			ATW-INT J NUCL POWER	ATW-Int.

J	Richardson, RB; Dunford, DW				Richardson, RB; Dunford, DW			A biochemical-based model for the dosimetry of dietary organically bound tritium - Part 1: Physiological criteria	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						dose, internal; tritium; modeling; dose assessment; intake, radionuclide	BODY PROTEIN-TURNOVER; METABOLISM; GLUCOSE; HUMANS; TRACER; STATE	In this paper the physiological criteria for a novel form of model are described whose biokinetics are governed by the overall metabolic reactions of the principal nutrients: carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The biokinetics of a particular element are based primarily on the oxidation of glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids and the formation of water, carbon dioxide, and urea. The compartmental models proposed follow the pathways of the major elements including hydrogen and, hence, tritium. The parameters for two models of differing complexity- called the HCNO-S and HCNO-C models-were evaluated here on the basis of biochemical reactions; the results of compartmental analysis are reported in an accompanying paper. The simpler form of the HCNO model has single compartments representing the principal nutrients. The more complex model includes compartments representing the longer-term retention of carbohydrates as glycogen, fats as adipose tissue, and proteins in bone and soft tissues. The pool sizes and hydrogen transfer rates are estimated. The incorporation of biochemical reactions and important metabolic parameters serve to give the models a greater semblance of physiological merit than those currently available. For example, ingestion of carbohydrates results in a respiratory quotient of 1.0 and 100% of the hydrogen content oxidized to water, which are the same as values published in the literature.

J	Richardson, RB; Dunford, DW				Richardson, RB; Dunford, DW			A biochemical-based model for the dosimetry of dietary organically bound tritium - Part 2: Dosimetric evaluation	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						dose, internal; tritium; modeling, dose assessment; intake, radionuclide	TRITIATED-WATER; METABOLISM; TISSUES; C-14	In this paper the dosimetry for a novel form of physiological model, whose biokinetics are governed by the overall metabolic reactions of the principal nutrients carbohydrates, fats and proteins, is evaluated by compartmental analysis. Two models of differing complexity, called the HCNO-S and HCNO-C models, were developed from parameters evaluated in an accompanying paper. The simpler form has single compartments representing the principal nutrients. The more complex model includes compartments representing the longer-term retention of carbohydrates as glycogen, fats as adipose tissue, and proteins in bone and soft tissues. The effective doses for various tritiated intakes are the same, or similar, as calculated by the two HCNO models, except for tritiated protein. The dose coefficient for an intake of tritiated water is approximately 8% greater than that recommended by the ICRP when the tritium body burden is considered as a homogenous pool. However, when the composition of individual organs is taken into account, the dose coefficient for an HTO intake is similar to22% greater than the ICRP value. The HCNO-C dose coefficient for OBT in a normal diet is 5.0 x 10(-11) Sv Bq(-1), which is 1.2-fold greater than the ICRP dose coefficient for an OBT intake. The HCNO-C composition model gave organ and tissue doses with the largest range for a tritiated Reference Man dietary intake, the highest dose (red marrow, then breast) being around three-fold the lowest. A property of the HCNO models, important for bioassay analyses, is that a major part (>90%) of an OBT intake is oxidized and excreted as HTO, which is physiologically more accurate than the current ICRP OBT model. The effective dose of specific tritiated foods, e.g., rice and wheat, was evaluated on the basis of their constituents.

J	Huston, TE; Farfan, EB; Bolch, WE; Bolch, WE				Huston, TE; Farfan, EB; Bolch, WE; Bolch, WE			Influences of parameter uncertainties within the ICRP-66 respiratory tract model: A parameter sensitivity analysis	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						modeling, biological factors; inhalation; respiratory system; biokinetics		An important aspect in model uncertainty analysis is the evaluation of input parameter sensitivities with respect to model outcomes. In previous publications, parameter uncertainties were examined for the ICRP-66 respiratory tract model. The studies were aided by the development and use of a computer code LUDUC (Lung Dose Uncertainty Code) which allows probabilities density functions to be specified for all ICRP-66 model input parameters. These density functions are sampled using Latin hypercube techniques with values subsequently propagated through the ICRP-66 model. In the present study, LUDUC has been used to perform a detailed parameter sensitivity analysis of the ICRP-66 model using input parameter density functions specified in previously published articles. The results suggest that most of the variability in the dose to a given target region is explained by only a few input parameters. For example, for particle diameters between 0.1 and 50 mum, about 50% of the variability in the total lung dose (weighted sum of target tissue doses) for (PuO2)-Pu-239 is due to variability in the dose to the alveolar-interstitial (AI) region. In turn, almost 90% of the variability in the dose to the AI region is attributable to uncertainties in only four parameters in the model: the ventilation rate, the AI deposition fraction, the clearance rate constant for slow-phase absorption of deposited material to the blood, and the clearance rate constant for particle transport from the AI(2) to bb(1) compartment. A general conclusion is that many input parameters do not significantly influence variability in final doses. As a result, future research can focus on improving density functions for those input variables that contribute the most to variability in final dose values.

In these surveys, indoor radon, external gamma dose rates outdoors and indoors and radioactivity in soils were measured. Measurements of indoor radon concentrations were performed in 214 dwellings by using nuclear track-etched detectors. External exposure from terrestrial gamma rays outdoors and indoors were measured in a total of 596 points. Radioactivity in soil samples collected at 293 sampling sites are also reported in this paper. By taking into account all sources of natural radiation exposure, mean annual effective doses to the population in the surroundings of the six Spanish nuclear power stations have been estimated and compared with those coming from their normal operation.

J	Whicker, JJ; Rodgers, JC; Moxley, JS				Whicker, JJ; Rodgers, JC; Moxley, JS			A quantitative method for optimized placement of continuous air monitors	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						air sampling; monitoring, air; radioactivity, airborne; occupational safety	DEPARTMENT-OF-ENERGY; WORKER PROTECTION; FLOW; VENTILATION	Alarming continuous air monitors (CAMs) are a critical component for worker protection in facilities that handle large amounts of hazardous materials. In nuclear facilities, continuous air monitors alarm when levels of airborne radioactive materials exceed alarm thresholds, thus prompting workers to exit the room to reduce inhalation exposures. To maintain a high level of worker protection, continuous air monitors are required to detect radioactive aerosol clouds quickly and with good sensitivity. This requires that there are sufficient numbers of continuous air monitors in a room and that they are well positioned. Yet there are no published methodologies to quantitatively determine the optimal number and placement of continuous air monitors in a room. The goal of this study was to develop and test an approach to quantitatively determine optimal number and placement of continuous air monitors in a room. The method we have developed uses tracer aerosol releases (to simulate accidental releases) and the measurement of the temporal and spatial aspects of the dispersion of the tracer aerosol through the room. The aerosol dispersion data is then analyzed to optimize continuous air monitor utilization based on simulated worker exposure. This method was tested in a room within a Department of Energy operated plutonium facility at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, U.S. Results from this study show that the value of quantitative airflow and aerosol dispersion studies is significant and that worker protection can be significantly improved while balancing the costs associated with CAM programs.

J	Parekh, P; Haines, D; Bari, A; Torres, M				Parekh, P; Haines, D; Bari, A; Torres, M			Non-destructive determination of Ra-224, Ra-226 and Ra-228 concentrations in drinking water by gamma spectroscopy	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						water; radium; spectroscopy, gamma; sampling	MINERAL WATERS; SPECTROMETRY	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency mandates that drinking water showing gross alpha-activity greater than 0.19 Bq L-1 should be analyzed for radium, a known human carcinogen. The recommended testing methods are intricate and laborious. The method reported in this paper is a direct, non-destructive gamma-spectroscopic method for the determination of Ra-224, Ra-226, and Ra-228, the three radium isotopes of environmental concern in drinking water. Large-volume Marinelli beakers (4.1-L capacity), especially designed for measuring radioactive gases, in conjunction with a low-background, high-efficiency (131%) germanium detector were used in this work. It was first established that radon, the gaseous decay product of radium, and its progeny are quantitatively retained in this Marinelli beaker. The Ra-224, Ra-226, and Ra-228 activity concentrations are determined from the equilibrium activities of their progeny : Pb-212, Pb-214 (Bi-214), and Ac-228; and the gamma-lines used in the analysis are 238.6, 351.9 (and 609.2), and 911.2 keV, respectively. The Ra-224 activity is determined from the first 1,000-min measurement performed after expulsion of radon from the sample. The Ra-226 activity is determined from the second, 2,400-min measurement, made 3 to 5 d later, and the Ra-228 activity is determined from either the first or the second measurement, depending on its concentration level. The method's minimum detectable activities are 0.017 Bq L-1, 0.020 Bq L-1, and 0.027 Bq L-1 for Ra-224, Ra-226, and Ra-228, respectively, when measured under radioactive equilibrium. These limits are well within the National Primary Drinking lVater Regulations required limit of 0.037 Bq L-1 for Ra-226 and for Ra-228. The precision and accuracy of the method, evaluated using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Environmental Resource Associates' quality control samples, were found to be within acceptable limits.

NRC regulations require that radioactive materials used or stored in controlled or unrestricted areas be secure from unauthorized removal or be under constant surveillance when in use. This leaves open to interpretation what types of security are required for radioactive materials in restricted, areas. Adhering to the goal of keeping exposures As Low As Reasonable Achievable (ALARA), a risk-based system for radioactive materials security in a university setting is proposed based on Annual Limits of Intake (ALI). This system establishes levels of security based on physical form, activity and concentration. Using this system, radiation safety personnel can more effectively establish reasonable security measures for radioactive material consistent with minimizing the realistic potential of serious harm or injury.

Across the United States, hundreds or medical schools and healthcare organizations affiliate with one another for the enhancement or patient care, education, and research. Oftentimes, both parties, in the affiliation have active clinical and research programs that involve the use of radioactive material (RAM). The combination of this close affiliation and use of radioactive material presents a number of challenging radiation safety compliance issues. It is important for radiation safety professionals (RSPs) employed by each affiliate to work together to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.

The experimental values were used for calculating heat capacities of the compounds, which were compared with Neumann-Kopp's heat capacity values. On inter comparison of the heat capacity values of solid solution, (ThyU(1-y))O-2, with variation in the fraction of ThO2, a trend was observed. In the temperature range of the present experiments, the compound (Th0.961U0.039)O-2 showed minimum heat capacity values. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Reactions of a synthetic slag-composition mixture with (NH4)(2)SO4 above 350 degreesC formed sulfate compounds of uranium, calcium and magnesium. The sulfates of uranium were separated by dissolving in dilute acid. Reactions were monitored by TG-DTA analysis. Products formed at different temperatures were characterised by X-ray powder diffraction. Quantitative analysis of the products was achieved using redox titrimetry. By this method about 95% of the uranium present could be recovered from synthetic mixtures. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two softening processes are found to occur in the fuels during irradiation. The first one appears at the pellet periphery when the local burn-up exceeds approximate to70 GWd/t M reflecting mainly the porosity build-up after rim restructuring. The second one affects the whole fuel when it reaches on average approximate to70 GWd/t M denoting a bulk irradiation damage release. The rim,material is found to acquire the stiffest possible configuration of porous solids showing the lowest property drop as a function of porosity and the largest admissible porosity (approximate to30%) without undergoing pore-phase opening. By assimilating the hardness data to other property vs. porosity relations, it is predicted that the porous rim material would show a higher Young modulus and thermal conductivity than a low burn-up fuel at equivalent porosity. This ensures not only a stiffer but also a cooler behaviour in reactor. (C) 2003 Elsevier. B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ekeroth, E; Jonsson, M				Ekeroth, E; Jonsson, M			Oxidation of UO2 by radiolytic oxidants	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							WASTE-DISPOSAL CONDITIONS; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; EQUILIBRIA; RADICALS; RATES	The kinetics of UO2 oxidation by H2O2 has been studied using aqueous suspensions Of UO2-powder. The second order,rate constant for the reaction between H2O2 and UO2 has been determined to 8 x 10(-7) m/min (based on the surface to solution volume ratio) in the absence of carbonate. By studying the reaction between UO2 and other oxidants, it is possible to draw conclusions concerning the mechanism. The logarithm of the second order rate constant, ln k, for UO2 oxidation appears to be linearly related to the one-electron reduction potential, E-0, of the oxidant. This indicates that the rate limiting step in the oxidation of UO2 is one-electron transfer. A Fenton like mechanism is plausible for the reaction between UO2 and H2O2. The diffusion controlled rate constant in this particular system is approximately 10(3) m/min, and therefore the reactions with OH- and CO3- are estimated to be diffusion controlled.

The root mean square errors of calculated thermal neutron flux distributions were less than 5% compared with the power calibration monitor traverse data. The root mean square error of calculated power distributions was less than 4% compared with the gamma-scanning data. The root mean square error of calculated burnup distributions was less than 3% compared with the gamma-scanning data. The averaged effective multiplication factor was 1.000 and its standard deviation was 0.002. The calculation accuracy of void reactivity coefficient was 3 x 10(-5) Deltak/k/%void for the equilibrium cores. The calculation accuracy of power coefficient was +/-1.5 x 10(-5) Deltak/k/%power. The accuracy of ATR type core design code system was enough for the core management in the Fugen Nuclear Power Station.

The computational code has the dynamic compartment analysis block at its core, the graphical user interface (GUI) for model formation, computation parameter settings, and results displays. The compartments are obtained by classifying various natural environments into groups that exhibit similar properties. The functionality of MOGRA is being verified by applying it in the analyses of the migration rates of radioactive substances from the atmosphere to soils and plants and flow rates into the rivers. In this report, a hypothetical combination of land usage was supposed to check the function of MOGRA. The land usage was consisted from cultivated lands, forests, uncultivated lands, urban area, river, and lake. Each land usage has its own inside model which is basic module. Also supposed was homogeneous contamination of the surface land from atmospheric deposition Of Cs-137 (1.0 Bq/m(2)). The system analyzed the dynamic changes of Cs-137 concentrations in each compartment, fluxes from one compartment to another compartment.
