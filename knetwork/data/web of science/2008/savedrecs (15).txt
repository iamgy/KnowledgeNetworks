Uncertainty assessment and analysis of ITER in-VV tritium inventory determination	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					Tracking of tritium inventories on ITER will be essential to ensure that the safety limits established for the mobilizable tritium inventory in the vacuum vessel are not violated. Tritium will be delivered to the ITER site from outside suppliers. Staring with the tritium imports the value of tritium inventory at ITER site will be known with a certain error that will propagate in time. During plasma operation, shot by shot measurements of the tritium delivered to the Torus and recovered will allow the amount of tritium trapped in the Torus to be computed at the end of the day. A case study for different measuring techniques and several measuring points for the tritium recovered from Torus have been done. An alternative method is to measure overnight the variation in the inventory of the storage and delivery system and the associated error when this method will be employed are presented. In order to reduce the errors on the tritium trapped in-vessel, at certain time intervals a method of global tritium inventory will be performed. The method envisages the transfer of all the mobilizable tritium from the plant and measurement of this inventory in the set(assay beds from the storage and delivery system. Evaluation of the most important sources of error for the tritium trapped in-vessel and means of minimization are eventually presented	[Cristescu, Ioana R.; Cristescu, I.; Glugla, M.] FZK, Tritium Lab, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Murdoch, D.] MPI Fuer Plasmaphy, EFDA CSU, Garching, Germany; [Ciattaglia, S.] CEA Cadarache, ITER IT, F-13108 St Paul Les Durance, France	Cristescu, IR (reprint author), FZK, Tritium Lab, POB 3640, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany.	ioana.cristescu@itp.fzk.de					CRISTESCU I, 2006, FUS ENG DESIGN, V81, P1; CRISTESCU IR, 2007, TW6TSSSEP1 EFDA; GIBBONS C, JW3FT214 EFDA; ITER technical basis, GA0FDR1010713R10 ITE; Murdoch D, 2005, FUSION ENG DES, V75-79, P667, DOI 10.1016/j.fusengdes.2005.06.246	5	0	0	0	1	AMER NUCLEAR SOC	LA GRANGE PK	555 N KENSINGTON AVE, LA GRANGE PK, IL 60526 USA	1536-1055			FUSION SCI TECHNOL	Fusion Sci.

Tritium processing tests for the validation of upgraded PERMCAT mechanical design	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				ITER; DETRITIATION; REACTOR; SYSTEM; GAS	The PERMCAT process, chosen for the final cleanup stage of the Tritium Exhaust Processing system in ITER, directly combines a Pd/Ag membrane and a catalyst bed for the detritiation of gaseous mixtures containing molecular and chemically bound tritium. Upgraded PERMCAT mechanical designs have been proposed to both increase the robustness and simplify the design of the reactor. One uses a special corrugated Pd/Ag membrane able to withstand change in length of the membrane during both normal operation and in the case of off-normal events. Based on this design, an upgraded PERMCAT reactor has been produced at FZK and successfully tested at TLK with ITER relevant tritiated gaseous mixtures using the CAPER facility.

Performance of a full-scale ITER metal hydride storage bed in comparison with requirements	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				ZIRCONIUM-COBALT; TRITIUM	The storage of hydrogen isotopes as metal hydride is the technique chosen for the ITER Tritium Plant Storage and Delivery System (SDS). A prototype storage bed of a full-scale has been designed, manufactured and intensively tested at the Tritium Laboratory, addressing main performance parameters specified for the ITER application. The main requirements for the hydrogen storage bed are a strict physical limitation of the tritium storage capacity (currently 70 g T(2)), a high supply flow rate of hydrogen isotopes, in-situ calorimetry capabilities with an accuracy of 1 g and a fully tritium compatible design. The pressure composition isotherm of the ZrCo hydrogen system, as a reference material for ITER, is characterised by significant slope. As a result technical implementation of the ZrCo hydride bed in the SDS system requires further considerations. The paper presents the experience from the operation of ZrCo getter bed including loading/deloading operation, calorimetric loop performance, and active gas cooling of the bed for fast absorption operation. The implications of hydride material characteristics on the SDS system configuration and design are discussed.

Hydrogen recovery times for a shorter packing-height bed (20 similar to 40mm) decreased exponentially with an increasing initial hydrogen pressure, but increased by approximately two orders of a magnitude in a longer packing-height bed (145mm). Dehydriding rate increases exponentially with an increase in the relative heating area per unit weight of ZrCo powder and decreases in the packing-height of ZrCo hydride. Continuous isotopic compositional change inevitably occurs during the entire delivery time due to the known isotope effect in the metal-hydrogen systems. To overcome the isotope effect during a delivery from the SDS beds, an alternative operation method was suggested for the fuel supply from the SDS.

Many researchers experimented in various conditions and estimated the relationship between ZrCo and hydrogen. In this study the kinetic approaches are performed using numerical simulations between ZrCo and hydrogen. Two kinds of parameter estimations are performed for the equilibrium pressure and the kinetics modeling and those are validated by the good agreement between predicted and experimental data. Based on the numerical simulation with obtained parameters, more rapid rates of dehydriding reaction can be achieved with lower pressure and higher temperature.

The tritium pressure from one side of the seal is 0.125 MPa, the nitrogen pressure from the other side is 0.075 MPa, the rotation speed is maintained at 1500 rpm.

A multi-purpose facility will be constructed at Rokkasho in Japan to carry out the above R&D. Beta and gamma radioisotopes as well as tritium (370 TBq/year) can be handled in the facility. At TPL (Tritium Process Laboratory) of JAEA, a series of R&D programs for tritium technologies have been carried out. The main R&D activities in this field are: tritium behavior in a confinement; monitoring; detritiation; and decontamination. In this paper, the results of recent activities at TPL of JAEA are also summarized from the viewpoint of the related R&D subjects under the BA program.

JET EFDA	Detritiation of JET tiles by laser cleaning	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					The retention of tritium (T) by carbon based deposits on tokamak surfaces is of increasing concern to the fusion community as the scale of tritium retention by this mechanism could be a limiting factor for the operation of fusion reactors, such as ITER. Hence there is a need to investigate ways of mitigating T retention and also for detritiating surfaces by either desorption of T or removal of tritiated deposits. The results of the removal of co-deposits from CFC tiles by pulsed laser ablation are reported here. The results show that it is possible to completely remove a 300 mu m thick hydrogen isotope rich carbon film at a rate of 12x10(-3) m(2)/hr by this method and that with optimisation of the laser parameters there is scope to improve the treatment rates to provide a useful tool for managing T inventory in tokamaks.

JET EFDA	Techniques for tritium recovery from carbon flakes and dust at the JET active gas handling system	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					Detritiation of highly tritium contaminated carbon and metal material used as first wall armour is a key issue for fusion machines like JET and ITER. Re-deposited carbon and hydrogen in the form of flakes and dust can lead to a build-up of the tritium inventory and therefore this material must be removed and processed. The high tritium concentration of the flake and dust material collected from the JET vacuum vessel makes it unsuitable for direct waste disposal without detritiation. A dedicated facility to process the tritiated carbon flake material and recover the tritium has been designed and built. In several test runs active material was successfully processed and detritiated in the new facility. Samples containing only carbon and hydrogen isotopes have been completely oxidized without any residue. Samples containing metallic impurities, e.g. beryllium, require longer processing times, adjusted processing parameters and yield an oxide residue. The detritiation factor was 2 x 10(4). In order to simulate in-vessel and ex-vessel detritiation techniques, the detritiation of a carbon flake sample by isotopic exchange in a hydrogen atmosphere was investigated. 2.8% of tritium was recovered by this means.

Determination of neutrino mass from tritium beta decay	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				ANTINEUTRINO REST MASS; UPPER LIMIT; UPSILON-E; SPECTRUM; SEARCH; FILMS	The most sensitive way to determine the neutrino mass scale without further assumptions is to measure the shape of a tritium beta spectrum near its endpoint. Tritium is the nucleus of choice because of its low endpoint energy, superallowed decay, simple nuclear properties and simple atomic structure. Tritium beta decay experiments have been performed for more than 60 years yielding in an upper limit of the electron neutrino mass of 2 eV/c(2). The Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino experiment (KATRIN) will improve the sensitivity on the neutrino mass by another order of magnitude. This article gives a short survey of 6 decades of tritium beta decay experiments and discusses the future steps.

J	Raman, R				Raman, Roger			Advanced fueling system for steady-state operation of a fusion reactor	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				COMPACT TOROID INJECTION; TOKAMAK; ACCELERATION	Steady-state Advanced Tokamak scenarios rely on optimized density and pressure profiles to maximize the bootstrap current fraction. Under this mode of operation, the fuelling system must deposit small amounts of fuel where it is needed, and as often as needed, so as to compensate for fuel losses, but not to adversely alter the established density and pressure profiles. A precision fuelling system has the capability for controlling the fusion burn by maintaining the required pressure profile to maximize the bootstrap current fraction. An advanced fuelling system based on Compact Toroid (CT) injection has the potential to meet these needs while simultaneously simplifying the requirements of the tritium handling systems. Simpler engineering systems would reduce reactor construction and maintenance cost through increased reliability. A CT fueling system is described together with the associated tritium handling requirements.

Application of membrane dehumidifier for gaseous tritium recovery in LHD	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				DETRITIATION PROCESS; POLYIMIDE MEMBRANE; SEPARATION; SYSTEM; MODULE; PERMEATION	In order to perform deuterium plasma experiments by using the Large Helical Device (LHD), the NIFS is planning to install a system for tritium recovery from exhaust gas. NIFS is planning to apply the latest technologies for tritium recovery. Oxidized tritium (tritiated water vapor) contained in the purge gas is usually removed using an absorbent column. However, if a dew point of less than -60 degrees C could be obtained using a polymer membrane dehumidifier, the equipment could be reduced in size and a more stable dehumidifying performance could be expected.

Helium effects on tritium storage materials	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					For ten years French Tritium laboratories have been using metal hydride storage beds with LaNi4Mn for process gas (HDT mixture) absorption, desorption and for both short and long term storage. This material has been chosen because of its low equilibrium pressure and of its ability to retain decay helium 3 in its lattice. Aging effects on the thermodynamic behavior of LaNi(4m)n have been investigated. Aging, due to formation of helium 3 in the lattice, decreases the desorption isotherm plateau pressure and shifts the a phase to the higher stoichiometries. Life time of the two kinds of tritium (and isotopes) storage vessels managed in the laboratory depends on these aging changes. The Tritium Long Term Storage (namely STLT) and the hydride storage vessel (namely FSH 400) are based on LaNi4Mn even though they are not used for the same applications. STLT contains LaNi4Mn in an aluminum vessel and is designed for long term pure tritium storage. The FSH 400 is composed of LaNi4Mn included within a stainless steel container. This design is aimed at storing low tritium content mixtures (less than 3% of tritium) and for supplying processes with HDT gas. Life time of the STLT can reach 12 years. Life time of the FSH 400 varies from 1.2 years to more than 25 years depending on the application.

Radiolytic decay of tritium to helium-3 in the metal matrix causes three classic changes in the performance of the hydride: the plateau pressure decreases, the plateau slope increases, and a heel forms, reducing the reversible capacity of the hydride. Deuterium and tritium isotherms were collected on the virgin materials, only tritium isotherms were collected at approximately 2 years, and both deuterium and tritium isotherms were collected at approximately 3.5 years of quiescent aging at 26 degrees C Each sample was loaded to 0.5-0.6 T/M prior to each aging period. Points of interest include comparisons of each sample at different aging periods and isotope effects on aged hydride isotherms. Partial restoration of thermodynamic properties by sample cycling has been observed in LANA. 75, though not previously reported in Pd. The methods and results are presented.	[Staack, G.

Tritium transfers evaluation on ITER HCLL TBM	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				HYDROGEN PERMEATION; PB-17LI; ISOTOPES	Within the framework of the development of technology for a fusion reactor, the need of tritium breeding in order to reach fuel self-sufficiency is a major issue. The systems allowing this tritium production (breeding blanket) have to deal with a main difficulty that comes from the tendency for tritium to diffuse through hot metallic walls. Because of the double function of the blanket: i) breeding the necessary Tritium and ii) efficiently extracting the deposited heat, the coolant-containing metallic surfaces used to promote the heat transfer lead also to a non negligible mass transfer of tritium from the breeder material towards the coolant. In order to improve the management of tritium, different studies have been launched in this field with applications to DEMO breeding blankets and to the corresponding Test Blanket Module (TBM) to be tested in ITER. The present paper is focused on the case of the helium cooled lithium lead (HCLL) blanket which is one of the two TBMs proposed by EU for testing in ITER. The study determines, for different scenarios of ITER operation (short pulse, long pulse and trains of back-to-back pulses), the flux of tritium between each circuit (mainly PbLi breeder and He coolant), and the inventories of tritium in each circuit. The establishment of mass balance equations for tritium in each circuit leads to a set of non linear differential equations solved in transient conditions since ITER pulses are too short to reach steady state. These equations rely mainly on Fick's law with a link to the tritium Sievert's constant in each metal.

This is essential not only to prove the ability to manage correctly the bred tritium but also to validate and qualify the neutronic codes for the prediction of tritium production in view of their use in future fusion plants. Two are the European candidates to be tested in ITER: the HCPB (Helium Cooled Pebble Bed) TBM and the HCLL (Helium Cooled Lithium Lead) TBM.

HT was the main chemical species of T that was released from Li, while HTO was the main one without Y absorption. SEM-EDX analysis revealed the transfer of not only T but also 0 originally included in Li as an impurity. Treatment of Y by HF was effective to remove oxides formed on the as-received Y plate and enhanced its hydrogenating rate.

Dosimetric impact evaluation of primary coolant chemistry of the internal tritium breeding cycle of a fusion reactor DEMO	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				DIFFUSION	Tritium will be responsible for a large fraction of the environmental impact of the first generation of DT fusion reactors. Today, the efforts of conceptual development of the tritium cycle for DEMO are mainly centred in the so called Inner Breeding Tritium Cycle, conceived as guarantee of reactor fuel self-sufficiency. The EU Fusion Programme develops for the short term of fusion power technology two breeding blanket conceptual designs both helium cooled. One uses Li-ceramic material (HCPB, Helium-Cooled Pebble Bed) and the other a liquid metal eutectic alloy (Pb15.7Li) (HCLL, Helium-Cooled Lithium Lead). Both are Li-6 enriched materials. At a proper scale designs will be tested as Test Blanket Modules in ITER. The tritium cycles linked to both blanket concepts are similar, with some different characteristics. The tritium is recovered from the He purge gas in the case of HCPB, and directly from the breeding alloy through a carrier gas in HCLL. For a 3GWth self-sufficient fusion reactor the tritium breeding need is few hundred grams of tritium per day. Safety and environmental impact are today the top priority design criteria. Dose impact limits should determine the key margins and parameters in its conception. Today, transfer from the cycle to the environment is conservatively assumed to be operating in a I-enclosure scheme through the tritium plant power conversion system (intermediate heat exchangers and helium blowers). Tritium loss is caused by HT and T2 permeation and simultaneous primary coolant leakage through steam generators. Primary coolant chemistry appears to be the most natural way to control tritium permeation from the breeder into primary coolant and from primary coolant through SG by H-2 tritium flux isotopic swamping or steel (EUROFER/INCOLOY) oxidation. A primary coolant chemistry optimization is proposed. Dynamic flow process diagrams of tritium fluxes are developed ad-hoc and coupled with tritiated effluents dose impact evaluations. Dose assessments are obtained from the use of appropriate numeric tools (NORMTRI).	[Velarde, M.; Perlado, J. M.] Univ Politecn Madrid, Inst Fusi Nucl DENIM ETSII, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; [Sedano, L.

Study on correlation between tritium release behavior and annihilation behavior of irradiation defects in neutron-irradiated Li4SiO4	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				RADIATION DEFECTS	Tritium release from thermal neutron-irradiated Li4SiO4 is initiated with the annihilation of E'-centers by recovering O- with diffusion of O-. Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) shows that differences in the formation of irradiation damage between 14 MeV and thermal neutrons in Li4SiO4 result in different tritium release behaviors. The kinetics for the annihilation of irradiation defects has been determined. The contribution of elastic collisions by 14 Me V neutrons was much higher than that of thermal neutrons. Isothermal annealing experiments show that annihilation of irradiation defects consisted of two processes: namely, the fast and slow annihilation processes. Their activation energies were determined to be 0.13 and 0.39 eV, respectively. Comparing the experimental results for the thermal and 14 Me V neutron-irradiated Li4SiO4 shows that the activation energies of the slow annihilation process were significantly different. These results relate to the density of irradiation defects, which in turn depend on the contribution of the recoil particles produced by nuclear reactions to form irradiation damaged sites.

Solubility, diffusivity, and isotopic exchange rate of hydrogen isotopes in Li-Pb	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					The diffusion, solution and permeation coefficients of hydrogen isotopes in liquid Li-Pb which is a candidate liquid blanket material for fusion reactors were determined in the temperature range 573-973K using an unsteady permeation method Each coefficiens was correlated to temperature as follows: DLi-Pb = 1.8 x 10(-8) exp(-11590/RT) [m(2)/S] (1) KLi-Pb = 2.1 x 10(-6) exp(-18700/RT) [1/Pa-0.5] (2) PLi-Pb = 1.8 x 10(-9) exp(-30290/RT) [mol/msPa(0.5)] (3) The hydrogen permeation flux depends on the square root of pressure at 773-973K. Although the power of pressure declined below 0.4 when temperature was below 673K, the effects of surface resistance were neglected above 673K. The hydrogen solubility in liquid Li-Pbwas found to correlate with a Sievert's constant. We calculated a height-equivalent to theoretical-plate of a gas-liquid countercurrent extraction tower for tritium recovery rates in liquid Li-Pb to be H-L = 7.0 x 10(-2) [m] (4).

With an aim to improve the infrastructure, the capabilities and safety, SCK.CEN's general management decided to refurbish the laboratories. A new ventilation system, including a stack and gloveboxes equipped with a detritiation installation, will allow a higher tritium inventory limit of 0.37 PBq. This paper discusses the ongoing refurbishment of the two neighboring tritium laboratories. Currently one laboratory has been denuclearized whilst the other is still in operation. Nevertheless a number of conclusions can already be drawn. We succeeded in denuclearizing most of the equipment and inftastructure without personnel receiving measurable tritium doses. If the free released metals had been disposed off at a nuclear melting facility, 22% of the costs could have been saved, however free release is more socially acceptable.

Star facility tritium accountancy	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					The Safety and Tritium Applied Research (STAR) facility has been established to provide a laboratory infrastructure for the fusion community to study tritium science associated with the development of safe fusion energy and other technologies. STAR is a radiological facility with an administrative total tritium inventory limit of 1.5g (14,429 Ci) [1]. Research studies with moderate tritium quantities and various radionuclides are performed in STAR. Successful operation of the STAR facility requires the ability to receive, inventory, store, dispense tritium to experiments, and to dispose of tritiated waste while accurately monitoring the tritium inventory in the facility. This paper describes tritium accountancy in the STAR facility. A primary accountancy instrument is the tritium Storage and Assay System (SAS): a system designed to receive, assay, store, and dispense tritium to experiments. Presented are the methods used to calibrate and operate the SAS. Accountancy processes utilizing the Tritium Cleanup System (TCS), and the Stack Tritium Monitoring System (STMS) are also discussed. Also presented are the equations used to quantify the amount of tritium being received into the facility, transferred to experiments, and removed from the facility. Finally, the STAR tritium accountability database is discussed.	[Pawelko, R. J.; Sharpe, J. P.; Denny, B.

Remote analysis of high-tritium-content water	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					Systems to safely analyze for tritium in moisture collected from glovebox atmospheres are being developed for use at Savannah River Site (SRS) tritium facilities. Analysis results will guide whether the material contains sufficient tritium for economical recovery, or whether it should be stabilized for disposal as waste. In order to minimize potential radiation exposures that could occur in handling and diluting high-tritium-content water, SRS sought alternatives to the process laboratory's routine analysis by liquid-scintillation counting. The newer systems determine tritium concentrations by measuring bremsstrahlung radiation induced by low-energy beta interactions. One of the systems determines tritium activity in liquid streams, the other determines tritium activity in water vapor. Topics discussed include counting results obtained by modeling and laboratory testing and corrections that are made for low-energy photon attenuation.	[Sigg, R. A.; DiPrete, D. P.; Pak, D.

J	Cordaro, JV; Wood, M				Cordaro, Joseph V.; Wood, Mike			Universal tritium transmitter	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					At the Savannah River Site and throughout the National Nuclear Security Agency (NNSA) tritium is measured using Ion or Kanne Chambers. Tritium flowing through an Ion Chamber emits beta particles generating current flow proportional to tritium radioactivity. Currents in the 1x 10(-15) A to 1x 10(-6) A are measured The distance between the Ion Chamber and the electrometer in NNSA facilities can be over 100 feet. Currents greater than a few microamperes can be measured with a simple modification. Typical operating voltages of 500 to 1000 Volts and piping designs require that the Ion Chamber be connected to earth ground. This grounding combined with long cable lengths and low currents requires a very specialized preamplifier circuit. In addition, the electrometer must be able to supply 'fail safe" alarm signals which are used to alert personnel of a tritium leak, trigger divert systems preventing tritium releases to the environment and monitor stack emissions as required by the United States federal Government and state governments. Ideally the electrometer would be "set monitoring". Self monitoring would reduce the need for constant checks by maintenance personnel. For example at some DOE facilities monthly calibration and alarm checks must be performed to ensure operation. NNSA presently uses commercially available electrometers designed specifically for this critical application. The problems with these commercial units include: ground loops, high background currents, inflexibility and susceptibility to Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) which includes RF and Magnetic fields. Existing commercial electrometers lack the flexibility to accommodate different Ion Chamber designs required by the gas pressure, type of gas and range. Ideally the electrometer could be programmed for any expected gas, range and high voltage output. Commercially available units do not have 'fail safe" self monitoring capability. Electronics used to measure extremely low current must have sufficient time to thermally equilibrate. Amplifiers, transistors, resistors all need time to stabilize before the electrometer circuit will measure accurately in the 10(-15) and 10(-14) ampere range. Existing electrometers give the user no indication when the unit has stabilized and is acceptable for low level measurements. Savannah River National Laboratory (SRAT) funded through the NNSA Plant Directed Research and Development (PDRD) program, has developed a truly Universal Tritium Transmitter (UTT) capable of solving many known problems with existing commercial electrometers. This UTT pushes the state-of-the-art in electrometer design and incorporates solutions to deficiencies found in commercial electrometers.

Operational experience and validation of the triathler (TM) model 425-034((1)) single vial liquid scintillation counter for meeting department of energy release criteria	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					Triathler (TM) Model 425-034 single vial liquid scintillation counter (LSC) counters have been in use at the Safety and Tritium Applied Research Facility (STAR) for approximately three years. During facility setup and determination of instrumentation needs to support STAR facility operations, the Triathler was chose to assess smearable tritium contamination levels for operational conditions. The Triathler was selected due to the rapid turnaround time for obtaining tritium contamination levels versus other automated batch LSC counters currently in use at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and other Department of Energy (DOE) installations. Operational experience with the Triathler thus far has shown a high reliability for verifying removable contamination levels at a level of <1,000 Disintegrations Per Minute (DPM) per 100 cm(2) when compared to the Packard (TM) Tri-Carb 1905 AB/LA Liquid Scintillation Analyzer used by the Reactor Technologies Complex (RTC) Radiochemistry Measurements Laboratory (RML). However, variances in the reported results for activity in DPM/vial from the Triathler versus the Packard Tri-Carb have been noted when operating in the range of 5, 000 to 20, 000 DPM. These variances make reliability and use of the Triathler suspect for verifying smearable contamination levels meet the release criteria identified in DOE Order 5400.5, Radiation Protection of the Public and Environment. Ensuring that removable tritium contamination levels on materials and equipment intended for free-release to the public are <10,000 DPM per 100 cm 2 is a requirement in the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) contract. Comprehensive cross-comparisons have been ongoing to ensure the Triathler LSC reported DPM values provide sufficient detection of smearable tritium contamination when cross-compared to other automated liquid scintillation counters available at the INL.

Evaluation of a newly developed tritium calorimeter at Los Alamos National Laboratory	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					The Los Alamos National Laboratory tritium processing facility purchased an ANTECH Series P300 Isothermal Tritium calorimeter from the ANTECH Corporation in 2005. The instrument is used to non-destructively measure the quantity of tritium in an item based on the heat output generated by tritium beta decay. Instrument performance data collected over the past two years is presented showing that this instrument can detect as low as 0.001 W (0.003 g of tritium) within rather large measurement canisters of approximately 170 nun (6.8 in) diameter by 610 mm (24 in) long. With a manufacturer-stated measurement power range of 0.005 W to 15 W, this calorimeter has performed beyond the specified purchase requirements. Using a combination of sensors for its thermal element, the P300 calorimeter has demonstrated exceptional sensitivity and precision.

Total amounts of tritium in the ZrNi alloy powders were previously estimated by a small ionization chamber Changes in radioactivity of two samples werefollowedfor three years, and it was seen that the activity changes obeys the half-life of 4505 days. The initial tritium amounts estimated by the small ionization chamber agreed well with the extrapolated values from the activity changes evaluated by the calorimeter Namely, it was suggested that the small ionization chamber is able to be used as a secondary standard of the tritium measuring devices. The beta-ray-induced X-ray counter was also calibrated for non-destructive measurements of high-level tritium by using the present small ionization chamber.

The optimum analyzer values were determined for parameters such as the bias (voltage) applied to the detector, counting gas flow rate, and mixing ratio of sample air to counting gas using an enclosed tritium reference source. After applying these optimized parameters, the factor for converting counting rate to tritium concentration was determined by conducting an experiment using tritiated methane gas. Finally, the detection limit of the monitor for air samples containing tritium was determined based on the conversion factor.

A prototype wearable tritium monitor	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					Sudden unexpected changes in tritium-in-air concentrations in workplace air can result in significant unplanned exposures. Although fixed area monitors are used to monitor areas where there is a potential for elevated tritium in air concentrations, they do not monitor personnel air space and may require some time for acute tritium releases to be detected. There is a need for a small instrument that will quickly alert staff of changing tritium hazards. A moderately sensitive tritium instrument that workers could wear would bring attention to any rise in tritium levels that were above predetermined limits and help in assessing the potential hazard therefore minimizing absorbed dose. Handheld instruments currently available can be used but require the assistance of a fellow worker or restrict the user to using only one hand to perform some duties.	[Surette, R.

A technique for synthesizing metal tritide standards	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				CE-H; SYSTEMS	Before surplus plutonium pits can be decommissioned and converted into metal oxides to be used as reactor fuels, residual tritium must be reduced to an acceptable level. We have developed two analytical methods involving melting and acid dissolution, combined with liquid scintillation counting as a quantitative and sensitive technique for measuring residual tritium in Pu metal. The detection limit, linearity, and reproducibility of these analytical methods must be validated with a series of metal tritide standards. Since there are no commercially available metal tritide standards, we have developed a technique for their synthesis. The synthesis of these low-level metal tritide standards is accomplished by charging cerium powder with a known amount of tritium to form a master cerium tritide alloy and then by aliquoting from this master alloy and diluting with pure cerium powder to form a series of standards with different tritium concentrations. The major difficulty in synthesizing these standards is that the samples contain extremely low levels of tritium, which span over three decades of concentrations. The synthesis technique and initial data obtained for cerium hydride samples will be presented.	[Bach, H. T.; Allen, T. H.; Hill, D. D.; Martinez, P. T.; Schwarz, R. B.; Paglieri, S. N.; Wermer, J.

It allows good release reduction performance for middle activity waste but in some cases tritium outgassing from the waste drums is too high. It was decided to overpackage each drum in a tighter container called the over-drum. According to good safety practices it was also decided to measure gas composition evolution into the over-drum in order to defect hydrogen formation over time. After a few months, a significant release reduction was observed. Additionally there followed contamination reduction in the roof storage building rainwater. However hydrogen was also observed in some over-drums, in addition to other radiolysis products. Catalyst will be added to manage the hydrogen risk in the over-drums.

Tritium removal and separation technology developments	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					Recent increased interest from regulators and the public has led more organizations to consider the enviromnental impact and safety considerations of tritium handling. Examples include the significance of the tritium isotope separation system on ITER licensing, remediation of ground water from power utilities and government facilities and concerns of high tritium concentrations within operational CANDU reactors. GE Healthcare, formerly Amersham plc, has been producing tritium-labelled chemicals since the late 1940s. GE's manufacturing site located near Cardiff, UK has installed a tritium waste treatment and enrichment facility to radically reduce tritium discharges to the environment. This facility employs a continuous processing plant that recovers tritium from a complex mixture of tritiated organic and aqueous waste compounds. Two isotope separation techniques are used to achieve a final pure tritium product, which is used in the manufacturing of labelled compounds. Building upon this experience, together with Special Separations Applications Inc. (SSAI), GE has developed a large-scale diffusion-based isotope separation process as an alternative to conventional cryogenic distillation. Having a tritium inventory an order of magnitude lower than conventional cryogenic distillation, this process is attractive for heavy water detritiation, applicable to single and multi-unit CANDU reactors and research reactors as well as fusion applications. Additionally, the new process has advantages of being cryogen-free, less complex, simple to operate and having improved conventional and radiological safety.

The critical issues for the recycling of used first wall beryllium are the presence of tritium and (transuranic) impurities. High temperature annealing seems to be the most promising technique for detritiation. Purification of the detritiated beryllium can be achieved by chlorination of the irradiated beryllium and the subsequent reduction of beryllium chloride to highly pure metallic beryllium. After that, the beryllium can be re-fabricated into first wall tiles via powder metallurgy which is already a mature industrial practice. This paper outlines the path to define the experimental needs for beryllium recycling and tackles problems related to the detritiation and the purification via the chlorine route.

Disposal pathway for tritiated reactive metals and tritiated hydrogen gas	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					Kinectrics and its predecessor company Ontario Hydro Research Division (a division of Ontario Hydro) had a fully operational tritium laboratory on site since the early 1980's. During those years numerous projects and experiments were undertaken using hydrogen and tritium for the most part. Metals with an affinity for hydrogen are commonly employed as scavengers of hydrogenic gases from process streams or as hydrogen storage mediums. The two most common of these metals used were depleted uranium and a zirconium-iron alloy (SAES St198). The break-up of Ontario Hydro through deregulation activities resulted in the building of a new, smaller, tritium laboratory and the decommissioning of the original tritium laboratory. Decommissioning activities resulted in the need to safely dispose of these reactive metals. Disposal of these metals is not straight forward. For safe, long term, disposal it has been decided to oxidize the metals in a controlled fashion. The oxidized beds, containing the metals, will be sent to a radioactive waste site for long term storage. Options for disposal of tritiated hydrogen gas are presented and discussed. This paper provides a disposal pathway for tritiated reactive metals and hydrogen thereby closing the loop in tritium handling.	[Antoniazzi, A. B.; Morton, C.

Concentration profiles of tritium penetrated into concrete	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				BEHAVIOR	Concentration profiles of tritium in cement paste, mortar and concrete were measured after exposure to tritiated water vapor for a given time. Tritium penetrated a distance of about 5 cm from the exposed surface during an exposure of 6 months. The model of tritium behavior in concrete materials reported by the present authors was developed in this study with the consideration of the effects of sand and aggregate on both the diffusion coefficient of tritiated water vapor and the isotope exchange capacity. Predictive calculations based on the tritium transport model were also carried out in some situations of tritium leakage. The results of the calculations show that a large amount of tritium will be trapped in the concrete walls, and the trapped tritium will be gradually released back to the tritium handling room over the time of months to years even after the decontamination of the room is completed.

Air passivation of metal hydride beds for waste disposal	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				TRITIUM-STORAGE; URANIUM; VESSEL	One waste acceptance criteria for hydride bed waste disposal is that the bed be non-pyrophoric. Batch-wise air ingress tests were performed which determined the amount of air consumed by a metal hydride bed. A desorbed, 4.4 kg titanium prototype hydride storage vessel (HSV) produced a 4.4 degrees C internal temperature rise upon the first air exposure cycle and a 0.1 degrees C temperature rise upon a second air exposure. A total of 346 scc air was consumed by the bed (0.08 scc per gram Ti). A desorbed, 9.66 kg LaNi4.25Al0.75 prototype storage bed experienced larger temperature rises over successive cycles of air ingress and evacuation. The cycles were performed over a period of days with the bed effectively passivated after the 12(th) cycle. Nine to ten STP-L of air reacted with the bed producing both oxidized metal and water.

The amount of tritium enclosed inside a wastes drum can be determined by the measurement of the leak rate of He-3 of this latter. The simulation predicts that a few months are necessary for establishing the equilibrium between the He-3 production inside the drum and the 3He drum leak. In practice, after one year of storage, sampling (3)Heoutside the drum can be realized by the mean of a confining chamber that collect the He-3 outflow. The apparatus, the experimental procedure and the calculation of tritium activity from mass spectrometric He-3 measurements are detailed. The industrial device based on a confinement cell and the automated process to measure the He-3 amount at the initial time and after the confinement time is described. Firstly, reference drums containing a certified tritium activity (HTO) in addition to organic materials have been measured to qualify the method and to evaluate its performances. Secondly, tritium activity of organic wastes drums issued from the storage building in Valduc have been determined. Results of the qualification and optimised values of the experimental parameters are reported in order to determine the performances of this industrial device. As a conclusion, the apparatus enables the measurement of an activity as low as 1 GBq of tritium in a 200 liters drum containing organic wastes.
