J	Zahringer, M; Kirchner, G				Zaehringer, Matthias; Kirchner, Gerald			Nuclide ratios and source identification from high-resolution gamma-ray spectra with Bayesian decision methods	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						X- and gamma-ray spectroscopy; Bayesian statistics; environmental monitoring; CTBT	CTBT VERIFICATION PURPOSES	Ratios of radionuclide activity concentrations are often used to identify sources of small traces of radioactivity in environmental samples. A new approach is presented to consider statistical uncertainties and their impact on decisions based on nuclide ratios particularly for cases where nuclide ratios are calculated from measurements close to or below detection limit. It is pointed out that decision threshold and detection limit are adequate for decisions on the presence of a single nuclide but not necessarily on decisions on nuclide ratios. A statistical analysis based on a Bayesian approach is presented which allows inference on probabilities of nuclide ratio values taking into account jointly the information available for all radionuclides of interest. Examples are discussed to demonstrate the improvements of this approach in spectrum analysis and in Source identification. As an important case the detection of Xenon isotopes (Xe-135, Xe-133m, Xe-133 and Xe-131m) that are relevant for detecting underground nuclear explosions in the context of the verification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is discussed. Nuclide ratios are crucial in order to distinguish civil releases from CTBT relevant Sources. A new method is presented for graphical evaluation of the xenon isotope measurements and for assigning potential Sources using the statistical approach proposed in this paper. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	Franceschini, F; Petrovic, B				Franceschini, Fausto; Petrovic, Bojan			Core physics analysis of 100% MOX core in IRIS	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								International Reactor Innovative and Secure (IRIS) is an advanced small-to-medium-size (1000 MWt) Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR), targeting deployment around 2015. Its reference core design is based on the current Westinghouse UO2 fuel with less than 5% U-235, and the analysis has been previously completed confirming good performance for that case. The full MOX fuel core is currently under evaluation as one of the alternatives for the second wave of IRIS reactors. A full 3-D neutronic analysis has been performed to examine main core performance and safety parameters, such as critical boron concentration, peaking factors, discharge burnup, reactivity coefficients, shut-down margin, etc. In addition, the basis to perform load follow maneuvers via the Westinghouse innovative strategy MSHIM has been established. The enhanced moderation of the IRIS fuel lattice facilitates MOX core design, and all the obtained results are within the operational and safety limits considered thus confirming viability of this option from the reactor physics standpoint.

J	Suyama, K; Murazaki, M; Ohkubo, K; Okuno, H				Suyama, Kenya; Murazaki, Minoru; Ohkubo, Kiyoshi; Okuno, Hiroshi			Active reduction of the end effect by local installation of neutron absorbers	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								In the burnup credit analyses of interim or long-term spent fuel (SF) storage facilities and transport casks, when the average burnup value is greater than approximately 30 GWd/t, the neutron multiplication factor becomes greater if we consider the axial burnup distribution of the spent fuel assembly rather than assuming an average burnup. This phenomenon is called the "end effect" and it is one of the main technical issues in burnup credit research. The end effect is characterized by an increase of the neutron flux around the end regions of the spent fuel assemblies in the criticality calculation. However, such increase of the neutron flux has not been observed in experiments using actual spent fuel assemblies. In this study, the reason why the end effect occurs in the criticality calculation of spent fuel assemblies is discussed based on analyses of the neutron distribution measurement using both fixed source and eigen-value calculations. It is shown that actual neutron flux increase occurs only when the neutron multiplication factor is close to unity. However it is always found in the eigenvalue calculation. The eigenvalue calculation evaluates the fundamental mode flux and the maximum eigenvalue which is assumed to be the neutron multiplication factor, and therefore an increased neutron flux around the end regions is obtained because the end regions have more importance, i.e., generate more neutrons than the central regions of higher burnup. Based on this consideration, it is expected that we would not have an increase of the neutron flux around the end regions when obtaining maximum eigenvalue, if we are able to reduce the importance of the end regions. Finally, we propose reducing the end effect actively by local installation of neutron absorbers (LINA) around the end regions of the fuel assemblies; their effectiveness was confirmed by several criticality calculations.

Physics principles to achieve comparable fission power from fertile and fissile rods of the conceptual ATBR/FTBR reactors	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							THORIUM	Loading of seedless fertile rods has been used as the central principle to maximize fertile to fissile conversion in the two thorium breeder reactor concepts, viz. ATBR and FTBR [Jagannathan, V., Pal, Usha, Karthikeyan, R., Ganesan, S., Jain, R.P., Kamat, S.U., 2001. ATBR - a thorium breeder reactor concept for an early induction of thorium in an enriched uranium reactor. Nuclear Technology 133, 1-32: Jagannathan, V., Pal, Usha, Karthikeyan, R., Raj Devesh, Srivastava, Argala, Ahmad Khan, Suhail, 2007. Reactor physics ideas to design novel reactors with faster fissile growth. In: Paper accepted for oral presentation in 'ICENES 2007 - 13th International Conference on Emerging Nuclear Energy Systems. 3-8 June 2007, Istanbul, Turkey]. At fresh state the seedless thoria rods will produce practically no fission power, or nearly thousand times less fission rate compared to the seed fuel rods. Hence it is conceived that the fuel assembly would be constituted by assembling the fresh seed rods with one fuel cycle irradiated fertile thoria rods. Even in this state there is a wide disparity between the fissile content of these rods. By judicious choice of the rod dimensions and their relative locations, a degree of balance in the fission rate is achieved in the fresh state of seeded rods. Remarkably as the burnup proceeds the initially seedless fertile rods have a continuous growth of fissile content LIP to an asymptotic value for a given spectrum and the fissile content in seeded rods monotonically decreases. If the discharge burnup is sufficiently large by design, it is seen that the power share of the initially seedless fertile rods can even exceed that of the seed fuel rods. The physics principles of achieving this characteristic are presented in this paper. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The irradiated target isotopes were Al-27, Si-28,Si-29, K-41, V-51, Ni-61, Cu-65, Zn-64,Zn-67, Ga-69, Br-79, Mo-92 and Nb-93. The cross sections of the Si-29 (n, p) Al-29, Zn-67(n, p) Cu-67, Ga-69(n, p) Zn-69m, Br-79(n, P) Se-79m, and Ga-69(n, alpha) Cu-66 reactions were obtained for the first time in the studied energy range. The d-D neutrons were generated by the deuterium gas target at the Van de Graaff accelerator (KN-VdG) at Nagoya University. All cross section values were determined relative to those of the In-115(n, n')In-115m reaction. The activities induced by the low-energy neutrons were corrected. For the corrections, the neutron spectra and mean neutron energies at the irradiation positions were calculated taking into account the energy loss of incident deuterons, the angular differential cross section of the d-D reaction and the solid angle subtended by the sample. The systematics of the (n, p) reactions at the neutron energy of 5.0 MeV in the mass range between 27 and 92 were proposed for the first time. This systematics can predict the cross sections within an accuracy of a factor of 1.6. (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Dall'Osso, A				Dall'Osso, Aldo			A neutron balance approach in critical parameter determination	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							SYSTEMS; SEARCH	The determination of a critical parameter, process known also as criticality or eigenvalue search, is one of the major functionalities in neutronics codes. The determination of the critical boron concentration or the critical control rod position are two examples. Classical procedures used to solve this problem are based oil the iterative Newton-Raphson method where the value of the parameter is changed until the eigenvalue matches the target. We present here a different approach where all equation, derived from the neutron balance, is set and the critical parameter is the unknown. Solving this equation is equivalent to solve an eigenvalue problem where the critical parameter is the eigenvalue. It is also shown that this approach call be seen as all application of inverse perturbation theory. This method reduces considerably the computation time ill situations where changes oil the critical parameter make a high distortion oil the flux distribution, as it is the case of the control rods. Some numerical examples illustrate the performances and the gain in stability in cases of simultaneous control of criticality and axial offset of the power distribution. The application to the determination of the critical uranium enrichment ill a transport code is also presented. The simplicity of the method makes its implementation in fuel bundle lattice and reactor codes very easy. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Choi, H				Choi, Hangbok			Automatic refueling simulation of a DUPIC fuel transition core	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							COMPOSITION HETEROGENEITY ANALYSIS; WATER REACTOR-FUEL; CANDU	This paper presents an automatic refueling simulation of a 713 MWe Canada deuterium uranium (CANDU-6) reactor transition to Direct Use of Spent Pressurized Water Reactor Fuel in CANDU Reactors (DUPIC) fuel system. The simulation searches for a set of refueling channels based oil the zone controller unit water level, the reactivity insertion tilt ill two axial zones and the discharge burnup. Compared to the natural uranium core, the transition core hits two distinctive features such as in axial power peaking and all inconsistent reactivity insertion into two axial zones with a fueling direction, which are accommodated by adjusting the reference power of the central zone and complying with the reactivity insertion tilt in the axial direction.

J	Muhammad, F; Majid, A				Muhammad, Farhan; Majid, Asad			Effects of high density dispersion fuel loading on the kinetic parameters of a low enriched uranium fueled material test research reactor	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								The effects of using high density low enriched uranium oil the neutronic parameters of a material test research reactor were studied. For this purpose, the low density LEU fuel of all MTR was replaced with high density LEU fuels currently being developed under the RERTR program. Since the alloying elements have different cross-sections affecting the reactor in different ways, therefore fuels U-Mo (9 w/o) which contain the same elements in same ratio were selected for analysis. Simulations were carried out to calculate core excess reactivity, neutron flux spectrum, prompt neutron generation time, effective delayed neutron fraction and feedback coefficients including Doppler feedback coefficient, and reactivity coefficients for change of water density and temperature. Nuclear reactor analysis codes including WIMS-B4 and CITATION were employed to carry out these calculations. It is observed that the excess reactivity at the beginning of life does not increase its the uranium density of fuel. Both the prompt neutron generation time and the effective delayed neutron fraction decrease as the uranium density increases. The absolute value of Doppler feedback coefficient increases while the absolute values of reactivity coefficients for change of water density and temperature decrease. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Monte Carlo simulation of radionuclide transport through fractured media	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							POROUS-MEDIA; CONTAMINANT TRANSPORT; MODEL; ROCK; NETWORKS	The presence of fractures within the host matrix may strongly affect the radionuclide mobility in the far-field of the current proposed Solutions for underground radioactive waste repositories. In this paper a Monte Carlo simulation approach, based on analogies, with neutron transport, has been developed for describing radionuclide transport in fractured media. The Monte Carlo approach here adopted is verified by means of comparison with analytic and numerical solutions for two different case studies. An application to a more complex and realistic case is also reported to show the potential of the proposed approach. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Vasiliev, A; Kolbe, E; Zimmermann, MA				Vasiliev, Alexander; Kolbe, Edwin; Zimmermann, Martin A.			Towards the development of upper subcriticality limits on the basis of benchmark criticality calculations	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								This paper concerns the assessment of standard point-wise neutron data libraries for criticality safety evaluations in units of the effective neutron multiplication factor, k(eff), the aim being to establish a methodology for the analysis of storage pools containing fuel assemblies discharged from the Swiss Light Water Reactors. The selected approach is based on using the Monte Carlo code MCNPX (version 2.4.0 was applied in the study at hand) and a modern standard point-wise neutron data library officially distributed by OECD/NEA databank. The approach is oriented towards meeting the broadly accepted general requirements to establish subcriticality, such as those formulated in the ANSI/ANS-8.1-1998 and ANSI/ANS-8.17-2004 Standards. In the above perspective, the results of the assessment of the standard neutron data libraries JEF-2.2 and JENDL-3.3 for criticality safety analysis of UO2 light water reactor fuel assemblies immersed in water, are provided and discussed. The assessment has been performed on the basis of a suite of low-enriched uranium thermal compound benchmarks selected from the international Handbook of Evaluated Criticality Safety Benchmark Experiments. Special emphasis is given to the appraisal of the applicability of the Gaussian distribution in the approximations and posterior analyses of the calculated benchmark results that are necessary to establish the k(eff) safety margins. Such application has been found to be justified, oil the one hand, by the observation of a very close agreement between parametric and non-parametric evaluations of the analyzed k(eff)(calc)/k(eff)(bench) samples; on the other hand, one indeed expects the k(eff)(calc)/k(eff)(bench) values of an ideal (cluster-less) set of criticality benchmarks with similar physical properties to follow a normal distribution. Nevertheless, we presume that similar deficiencies in the specification of the configurations belonging to one or similar series of experiments Could cause unspecified experiment/evaluation-related systematic errors in the benchmark evaluations and consequently in the k(eff)(bench)-values. Therefore, even distribution-free estimates will not be rigorous because they also rely on the assumption of random sampling of the k(eff)(calc)/k(eff)(bench) population. Moreover, we suggest that the question of normality appears to be of minor importance compared to other hypotheses and to the conservative approximations typically assumed for criticality safety evaluations.

Additionally, the IEN radioactive waste repository has been enlarged during the past last years, receiving a considerable amount of radioactive materials. Therefore, it became necessary to evaluate a possible increase of the environmental gamma exposure rates at the institute site due to the operation of the new accelerator and the enlargement of the institute waste repository as well. LiF:Mg,Cu,P, TLD-100H, and TL detectors were employed for environmental kerma rate evaluation and the results were compared with previous results obtained before the RDS-111 operation initialisation and the enlargement of IEN waste repository. No significant contribution for the enhancement of environmental gamma kerma rates was detected. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[da Rosa, L. A.

On the sites considered, each vehicle drives slowly by radiation detectors that scan for neutron and gamma radiation, resulting in a time series profile. One performance limitation is that naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM), such as cat litter, are routinely shipped across borders, leading to nuisance alarms. One strategy for nuisance alarms is to define and recognize "signatures" of certain types of NORM so that many nuisance alarms can be quickly resolved as being innocent. Here, we consider candidate profile features, such as the peak width and the maximum energy ratio, and use pattern recognition methods to illustrate the extent to which several common types of NORM can be distinguished.

Aerial gamma spectrometric survey as a tool for evaluating the uranium remobilization degree: Case study from Al-Awabed area, Northern Palmyrides, Syria	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						phosphate and uranium prospecting; uranium remobilization; aerial spectrometry survey; Al-Awabed region; Syria	STATISTICAL FACTOR-ANALYSIS; PHOSPHATIC DEPOSITS; SIGNATURES	The relationships between equivalent uranium (eU), eTh, K% and their ratios in the 11 lithological units determined by previous research in the Al-Awabed area, Northern Palmyrides, Syria have been analyzed in order to define their trend variations and evaluate the degree of uranium remobilization. Uranium favorability index U-1 and alteration-F indicators have been used in this research to characterize the different lithological units by following their radioactive element re-distribution and to determine their favorability as regards uranium potentiality. It was shown that uranium remobilization took place in all the lithological units, but to different degrees. This remobilization is qualified as weak, indicating that limited uranium redistribution is expected in the studied region. A plausible geological model is proposed for the uranium distribution, where the Abou Qila location is found to be favorable for uranium accumulation and merits further uranium exploration.

ANALYSIS OF QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE NONPROLIFERATION OF FISSILE MATERIALS FOR LOW- AND MEDIUM-CAPACITY NUCLEAR POWER SYSTEMS	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The principles used in the design of low- and medium-power nuclear power systems to decrease the proliferation risk for nuclear materials as well as the results of a comparative analysis of GT-MGR, KLT-40, ABV and foreign-produced light-water PWRs from this standpoint are presented. The INPRO methodology and modified KAERI for examining the DUPIC fuel cycle are used for nonproliferation assessment. The results show that at the stage where fuel is used in a reactor the resistance to nonproliferation of nuclear materials for the facilities which are now being designed is close to that determined for PWR and is even higher for GT-MGR with low-enrichment uranium fuel.

CORRECTING THE ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION OF REGENERATED URANIUM WITH RESPECT TO U-232 BY A CENTRIFUGE METHOD WITH INTRODUCTION OF A CARRIER GAS	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article							EXTRACTION	Theoretical and experimental studies dealing with correcting the isotopic composition of regenerated uranium with respect to U-232 by a centrifuge method with introduction of a carrier gas are reported. In order to increase the efficiency of separating U-232 from the spent uranium and reduce the loss of U-235, the use of a carrier gas is proposed - the gaseous compound (C8H3F13)-C-12, which is inert to uranium hexafluoride, and whose molecular weight, M-c = 346 amu, matches that of (UF6)-U-232. Freon, C8H3F13, is shown not to decompose during operation in the rotor of a centrifuge or to interact with the centrifuge material. The measured absorption parameters of freon on sodium fluoride NaF confirm the feasibility of efficient separation of a mixture of uranium hexafluoride and freon with return of the freon to the separation process. It is shown that introducing a carrier gas into the centrifuge technology can yield some new results: lowering the radioactivity of the commercial product, normalizing the overall radiation situation during production, increasing the recovered U-235 in the commercial product, and reducing the volume of radioactive waste. The recovery of U-235 in the commercial product can be increased to 99% or more. Then the U-232 content in the commercial product is similar to 2.10(-8)% or a factor of 10 less than the maximum allowable content of 2.10(-7)%.	[Prusakov, V. N.; Sazykin, A. A.; Sosnin, L.

DETERMINATION OF THE NEUTRON FLUX AND gamma RADIATION IN THE CORE OF OPERATING AND SHUT-DOWN REACTORS USING QUARTZ GLASSES AND ELEMENT MONITORS	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The neutron fluxes and the intensity of gamma radiation are measured in 26 channels of a VVR-SM reactor and its thermal column. The fast neutron fluxes in the channels are determined using Ni, Fe, Co, Au, and Mn element monitors with different threshold energies, together with a theoretical calculation using the MCNP-4C program. The energy distribution of the neutron flux inside the fuel assembly is obtained for selected channels around the core. The flux of neutrons with energies >1 MeV is in the range (0.5-43).10(12) cm(-2) sec(-1), depending on the location of the channel. A linear correlation is discovered between the induced optical absorption at the 215 nm line (E' center) Of SiO(2)-BaO glass and the fast neutron flux in the channels. The gamma-ray intensity in the thermal channel is estimated for the reactor during operation (similar to 38.4 Gy/sec) and 24 hours after it is shut down (similar to 24.7 Gy/sec) using the E' centers induced in pure quartz glasses. The observed difference in the efficiency with which oxygen defects are formed during dry and wet irradiation of glass owing to the radiolysis of water must be taken into account when developing radiation technology and during the burial of radioactive waste.

Determination of Pu-240/Pu-239 isotopic ratios in human tissues collected from areas around the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site by sector-field high resolution ICP-MS	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						atomic bomd; lungs; human; plutonium; radiation; atmospheric	AUTOPSY TISSUE; PU ISOTOPES; FALLOUT PLUTONIUM; CS-137; SOIL; KAZAKSTAN; SAMPLES; RADIOACTIVITY; SEPARATION; EXCHANGE	Information on the Pu-240/Pu-239 isotope ratios in human tissues for people living around the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site (SNTS) was deduced from 9 sets of soft tissues and bones, and 23 other bone samples obtained by autopsy. Plutonium was radiochemically separated and purified, and plutonium isotopes (Pu-239 and Pu-240) were determined by sector-field high resolution inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. For most of the tissue samples from the former nine subjects, low Pu-240/Pu-239 isotope ratios were determined: bone, 0.125 +/- 0.018 (0.113-0.145, n = 4); lungs, 0.063 +/- 0.010 (0.051-0.078, n = 5); and liver, 0.148 +/- 0.026 (0.104-0.189, n = 9). Only Pu-239 was detected in the kidney samples; the amount of Pu-240 was too small to be measured, probably due to the small size of samples analyzed. The mean Pu-240/Pu-239 isotope ratio for bone samples from the latter 23 subjects was 0.152 +/- 0.034, ranging from 0.088 to 0.207. A significant difference (a two-tailed Student's t test; 95% significant level, alpha = 0.05) between mean Pu-240/Pu-239 isotope ratios for the tissue samples and for the global fallout value (0.178 +/- 0.014) indicated that weapons-grade plutonium from the atomic bombs has been incorporated into the human tissues, especially lungs, in the residents living around the SNTS. The present Pu-239,Pu-240 concentrations in bone, lung, and liver samples were, however, not much different from ranges found for human tissues from other countries that were due solely to global fallout during the 1970's-1980's.

Uncertainty analysis of doses from inhalation of depleted uranium	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						analysis; statistical; dose reconstruction; inhalation; uranium; depleted	HUMAN RESPIRATORY-TRACT; DEPOSITION; CLEARANCE; FLOW	Measurements of uranium excreted in urine have been widely used to monitor possible exposures to depleted uranium (DU). This paper describes a comprehensive probabilistic uncertainty analysis of doses determined retrospectively from measurements of DU in urine. Parametric uncertainties in the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) Human Respiratory Tract Model (HRTM) and ICRP systemic model for uranium were considered in the analysis, together with uncertainties in an alternative model for particle removal from the lungs. Probability distributions were assigned to HRTM parameters based on uncertainties documented in ICRP Publication 66 and elsewhere, including the Capstone study of aerosols produced after DU penetrator impacts. Uncertainties in the uranium systemic model were restricted to transfer rates having the greatest effect on urinary excretion, and hence retrospective dose assessments, over the measurement times considered (10-10(4) d). The overall uncertainty on dose the ratio of the upper and lower quantiles, q(0.975)/q(0.025) was estimated to be about a factor of 50 at 10 days after intake and about a factor of 10 at 10(3)-10(4) d. The dose to the lung dominated the committed effective dose, with the lung absorption parameters, particularly the slow dissolution rate, ss, dominating the overall uncertainty. The median dose determined front a measurement of I ng DU, collected in urine in a 24-h period, varied from 0.1 mu Sv at 10 d to about I mSv at 104 d. Despite the large uncertainties, the upper q(0.975) quantile for the assessed dose was below 1 mSv up to 5,000 d.	[Puncher, A.; Bailey, A. R.; Harrison, J.

An experimental analysis of the contribution of Po-210 and of Po-210 produced by Pb-210 decay to the gross alpha-particle activity of water samples	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						alpha particles; environmental radioactivity; Po-210; water	PROGENY; RA-226	The contribution of Po-210 and of Po-210 produced by Pb-210 decay to the gross alpha-particle activity of water samples by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Method 900.0 is investigated as a function of residue mass and geometry and time between sample collection and analysis. It is shown that these factors can cause the contribution to gross alpha-particle activity of Po-210 to be up to 2.0 and 1.1 times the initial Po-210 activity for grab and quarterly composite samples, respectively, and can cause the contribution to gross alpha-particle activity, of Po-210 from Pb-210 decay to be up to 1.1 times and 1.5 times the Pb-210 activity for grab and quarterly composite V, samples, respectively. It is also shown qualitatively that at least for some residues, there is a loss of polonium due to volatilization when the sample is heated over a name.

Monte Carlo simulations have been combined with experimental measurements to estimate the level of contamination in the steel of the HML's whole body counting chamber. A 24-h empty chamber background count showed the presence Of (CS)-C-137 and Co-60. The estimated activity Of (CS)-C-137 in the 51 tons of steel was 2.7 kBq in 2007 (51.3 mu Bq g(-1) steel) which would have been 8 kBq at the time of manufacture. The Co-60 that was found in the background spectrum is postulated to be contained in the bed-frame. The estimated amount in 2007 was 5 Bq and its origin is likely to be contaminated scrap metal entering the steel production cycle sometime in the past. The estimated activities are 10 to 25 times higher than the estimated minimum detectable activity For this measurement. These amounts have no impact on the usefulness of the whole body counter.

The main mechanism for ion acceleration is charge separation in a plasma due to high-energy electrons driven by the laser inside the target. Another very new branch of fast ignition research is the investigation of the use of laser generated proton beams. In the present paper aims to provide insights into the feasibility of the fast ignition concept with high energy beams of protons generated in laser-plasma interactions. The optimum parameters of an ion beam and laser pulse that are suitable for an ignition spark in a hot precompressed DT fuel are estimated as a rough guide. Also, in this paper we estimate the radius of Deuterium-Tritium (DT) fuel pellet that is equal to the protons range in DT plasma.	[Motlagh, S. N. Hosseini; Mohamadi, Sh.

Studies on the dynamics of D-T fusion reaction based on the relativistic equilibrium velocity distribution	JOURNAL OF FUSION ENERGY			English	Article						fusion; deuterium; tritium; relativistic; energy		The Coulomb barrier is in general much higher than thermal energy. Nuclear fusion reactions occur only among few protons and nuclei (i.e., deuterium and tritium) with higher relative energies than Coulomb barrier. It is the equilibrium velocity distribution of these high-energy protons and nuclei that participates in determining the rate of nuclear fusion reactions. In the circumstance it is inappropriate to use the Maxwellian velocity distribution for calculating the nuclear fusion reaction rate. We use the relativistic equilibrium has a reduction factor with respect to that based on the Maxwellian distribution, which factor depends on the temperature, reduced mass and atomic numbers of the studied nuclear fusion reactions. In this paper, we concluded at energy range 10(5) (keV) <= E <= 10(6) (keV), that is smaller than reduced mass energy of deuterium-tritium, m(r)c(2), the numerical values of R and R-M are not different from each other very much, but by increasing energy near the region of m(r)c(2) the difference between them are visible, also by increasing energy for example 9 x 10(6) (keV) <= E <= 10 x 10(6) (keV) the difference is obviously more visible. Therefore, we have to use relativistic equilibrium velocity distribution instead of Maxwellian velocity distribution.	[Motlagh, S. N.

While in a fission reactor the separation makes possible a growing neutron chain reaction, it here makes possible the autocatalytic amplification of the thermomagnetic currents by an increase of the fusion reaction rate through a rise of the plasma pressure by the magnetic pressure of the thermomagnetic currents. This is expected to substantially increase the product n tau over its Lawson value.

For self-sustaining (D-T) fusion driver tritium breeding ratio should be greater than 1.05. Working out the systematics of (n, t) reaction cross-sections are of great importance for the definition of the excitation function character for the given reaction taking place on various nuclei at energies up to 20 MeV. In this study we have investigated asymmetry term effect for the (n, t) reaction cross-sections at 14-15 neutron incident energy. It has been discussed the odd-even effect and the pairing effect considering binding energy systematic of the nuclear shell model for the new experimental data and new cross-sections formulas (n, t) reactions developed by Tel et al. We have determined a different parameter groups by the classification of nuclei into even-even, even-odd and odd-even for (n, t) reactions cross-sections.

J	Ubeyli, M; Yapici, H				Ubeyli, Mustafa; Yapici, Hueseyin			Utilization of heavy metal molten salts in the ARIES-RS fusion reactor	JOURNAL OF FUSION ENERGY			English	Article						heavy metal molten salt; fissile fuel breeding; tritium breeding	POWER-PLANT; DESIGN; ISSUES	ARIES-RS is one of the major magnetic fusion energy reactor designs that uses a blanket having vanadium alloy structure cooled by lithium [1, 2]. It is a deuterium-tritium (DT) fusion driven reactor, having a fusion power of 2170 MW [1, 2]. This study presents the neutronic analysis of the ARIES-RS fusion reactor using heavy metal molten salts in which Li(2)BeF(4) as the main constituent was mixed with increased mole fractions of heavy metal salt (ThF(4) or UF(4)) starting by 2 mol.% up to 12 mol.%. Neutron transport calculations were carried out with the help of the SCALE 4.3 system by solving the Boltzmann transport equation with the XSDRNPM code in 238 neutron groups and a S(8)-P(3) approximation. According to the numerical results, tritium self-sufficiency was attained for the coolants, Flibe with 2% UF(4) or ThF(4) and 4% UF(4). In addition, higher energy multiplication values were found for the salt with UF(4) compared to that with ThF(4). Furthermore, significant amount of high quality nuclear fuel was produced to be used in external reactors.

Its blanket has two different transmutation zones (MA transmutation zone, TZ(MA), and LLFP transmutation zone, TZ(FP)), located separately from each other. High burn-up pressured water reactor (PWR)-mixed oxide (MOX) spent fuel is used as HLW. The time-dependent transmutation analyses have been performed for an operation period (OP) of up to 10 years by 75% plant factor (eta) under a first-wall neutron load (P) of 5 MW/m(2). The effective half-lives of the MA and LLFP nuclides can be shortened significantly in the considered FDT while substantial electricity is produced in situ along the OP.

Processing of uranium oxide and silicon carbide based fuel using polymer infiltration and pyrolysis	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							FUSION ENERGY APPLICATIONS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; SICF/SIC COMPOSITES; MATRIX COMPOSITES; NUCLEAR-FUEL; INERT MATRIX; FABRICATION; U3O8; REDUCTION	Ceramic composite pellets consisting of uranium oxide, UO2, contained within a silicon carbide matrix, were fabricated using a novel processing technique based on polymer infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP). In this process, particles of depleted uranium oxide, in the form of U3O8, were dispersed in liquid allylhydridopolycarbosilane (AHPCS), and Subjected to pyrolysis up to 900 degrees C under a continuous flow of ultra high purity argon. The pyrolysis of AHPCS, at these temperatures, produced near-stoichiometric amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC). Multiple polymer infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP) cycles were performed to minimize open porosity and densify the silicon carbide Matrix. Analytical characterization was conducted to investigate chemical interaction between U3O8 and SiC. It was observed that U3O8 reacted with AHPCS during the very first pyrolysis cycle, and was converted to UO2. As a result, final composition of the material consisted of UO2 particles contained in an a-SiC matrix. The physical and mechanical properties were also quantified. It is shown that this processing scheme promotes uniform distribution of uranium fuel source along with a high ceramic yield of the parent matrix. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This glass was buried in a lysimeter in the SRS burial ground for 24 years. Lysineter leachate data was available for the first 8 years. The glass was exhumed in 2004. The glass was predicted to be very durable and laboratory tests confirmed this. Scanning electron microscopy of the glass burial surface showed no significant glass alteration consistent with results of other laboratory and field tests. Radionuclide profiling for alpha, beta, and (137)Cs indicated that Pu was not enriched in the soil while (137)Cs and (90)Sr were enriched in the first few centimeters surrounding the glass. Lysimeter leachate data indicated that (90)Sr and (137)CS leaching from the glass was diffusion controlled. (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Gueneau, C; Chatillon, C; Sundman, B				Gueneau, Christine; Chatillon, Christian; Sundman, Bo			Thermodynamic modelling of the plutonium-oxygen system	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							O-U SYSTEM; CRYSTAL STRUCTURE; HEAT-CAPACITY; COMPOSITION RANGE; DEGREES K; X-RAY; DIOXIDE; PUO2-X; PHASE; TEMPERATURE	The published data for the thermodynamic functions and phase equilibria of the plutonium-oxygen system have been examined. Some inconsistencies have been found for oxygen chemical potential and vaporization data of [Pu2O3 + PuO2-x]and PuO2-x domains. As the original chemical potential data were not performed at the same temperature and O/Pu ratio, a chart with fixed temperature and composition ranges was built in order to compare all the experimental data. The discrepancies remain difficult to explain. Thermodynamic models of all the phases have been derived by the least-squares minimization procedure using the Thermo-Calc software. The compound energy formalism with the sublattice models (Pu3+, Pu4+),(O2- ,Va)(2) and (Pu3+, Pu4+)(2)(O2-)(3)(O2-, Va)(1) have been chosen to account for the crystal structure, defect chemistry and thermodynamic properties of respectively PuO2-x and PuO1.61 phases. The liquid phase was described using the ionic two-sublattice model (Pu3+)(P)(O2-, Va(Q-), PuO2, O)(Q). The reliability of the refined parameters is demonstrated by calculation of the phase diagram, the thermodynamic properties of the phases and the equilibrium partial pressures in the Pu2O3-PuO2 region. Considering the large uncertainties on the experimental information, an overall good agreement was obtained. To improve the thermodynamic description of the system, some missing experimental data are listed. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Soderquist, C; McNamara, B; Oliver, B				Soderquist, Chuck; McNamara, Bruce; Oliver, Brian			Dissolution of uranium metal without hydride formation or hydrogen gas generation	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							ALLOYS	This study shows that metallic uranium will cleanly dissolve in carbonate-peroxide solution without generation of hydrogen gas or uranium hydride. Metallic uranium shot, 0.5-1 mm diameter, was reacted with ammonium carbonate-hydrogen peroxide solutions ranging in concentration from 0.13 M to 1.0 M carbonate and 0.50 M to 2.0 M peroxide. The dissolution rate was calculated from the reduction in bead mass, and independently by uranium analysis of the solution. The calculated dissolution rate ranged from about 4 x 10(-3) to 8 x 10(-3) mm/h, dependent primarily on the peroxide concentration. Hydrogen analysis of the etched beads showed that no detectable hydrogen was introduced into the uranium metal by the etching process. (C) 2008 Flsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thermodynamic study of actinides and lanthanides during total vaporisation of a very high burn-up UO2 fuel	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Review							MASS-SPECTROMETRIC MEASUREMENT; FISSION-PRODUCT RELEASE; HIGH-TEMPERATURE; CROSS-SECTIONS; NUCLEAR-FUEL; PHASE BEHAVIOR; OXYGEN SYSTEM; 100 MWD/KGHM; OXIDE FUEL; IONIZATION	A commercial PWR fuel sample of local burn-up of about 200 GWd/t was annealed in a Knudsen Cell Mass Spectrometer system (KCMS) with a temperature rate of 10 K/min up to 2750 K at which temperature the sample was completely vaporised. At high temperature the vapour above the sample contains mainly actinide and lanthanide oxides, the vapour pressure Of refractory metals remaining below the detection limit. The local isotopic composition was determined by mass spectrometry and indicated a high content in higher actinides. From comparison of the partial vapour pressure with data for the pure oxides, obtained from experiments or literature, it is demonstrated that the actinide and lanthanide oxides dissolved in UO2 matrix obey Henry's law.

Aqueous dissolution tests of AgI powder in FeCl2 solutions (10(-6) M to 10(-3) M) were performed in it glove box purged with a gas mixture (Ar + 5% H-2). The test results showed that AgI dissolves to release iodine at extremely slow rates, being controlled by it diffusion process in any FeCl2 solution. The comparison with thermodynamic calculations based on redox equilibria suggested that the AgI dissolution proceeds by redox reaction between Ag+ and Fe2+; however, it was far from the thermodynamic equilibrium. These results suggested that the form of AgI itself has a potential to immobilize iodine for a long time even under the disposal conditions. Solid-phase analysis for the reacted AgI by using SEM/EDS showed a certain amount of silver (maybe metallic silver) precipitated at the surface. On the basis of these results and discussion. a potential mechanism for the actual AgI dissolution was proposed as follows. The AgI dissolution proceeds by redox reaction between Ag+ and Fe2+ to release I-, which results in the precipitation of metallic silver as it reduction product of Ag+ at the AgI surface to form a thin layer covering the AgI surface. The silver layer evolves to be protective against the transport of reactant species, by which the further dissolution to reach the equilibrium is suppressed. Consequently, the dissolution proceeds at extremely slow rates. being, controlled by it diffusion process.

The simulated HLW glass was separated into SiO2-rich and B2O3-rich phases at 973 and 873 K when the ternary mass ratio of SiO2:B2O3:Na2O was adjusted to 68:27:5 by the addition of SiO2 and B2O3 to the simulated HLW glass. Annealing at the lower temperature of 878 K promoted the distribution of the elements in the B2O3-rich phase. Approximately 90% of the Ni, Zn, Fe, Nd, Te, Zr, and Mo were distributed in the B2O3-rich phase, and these elements, except Zr, were almost completely leached into 1 mol dm(-3) nitric acid at 363 K. The leaching of Zr was also achieved using 1.5 mol dm(-3) sulfuric acid after the nitric acid leaching. The leached fractions of the glass-network components. Such as B and Al, were lower than the other elements at approximately 70-80% due to the existence in the SiO2-rich phase. An increase in the concentration of CaO in the glass in the range of 2-5 wt% inhibited the distribution of elements into the B2O3-rich phase. The increase in the concentration of CaO also changed the structure of the B2O3-rich phase from the continuous unit shape to the discontinuous spherical shape. Consequently, the leaching fraction of every element dramatically decreased. The structure of the B2O3-rich phase returned to continuous when the concentration of CaO was more than 10 wt%. From this glass, the leaching of 69% Zr was possible using only nitric acid without any sulfuric acid.

In this study, metal active gas (MAG) welding, a typical arc welding method, was evaluated for its applicability in sealing a carbon steel overpack lid with a thickness of 190 mm. Welding conditions and parameters were examined with multilayer welding for three different groove depths. Welded joint tests including the observation of macro- and microstructures were conducted, and mechanical properties were within tentatively applied criteria. Measurements and numerical calculations for residual stress were also conducted, and residual stress distribution tendencies were discussed. These test results were compared with those previously reported for tungsten inert gas welding (TIG) and electron beam welding (EBW). MAG welding possesses the potential to complete overpack lid closure with a maximum groove depth of 190 mm, but the applicability of MAG welding to overpack final closure should be discussed from the viewpoint of the presence of slag inclusions possibly induced in the weld metal.

Several experiments were conducted involving uranium, plutonium, and elements simulating fission products (FPs) or corrosion products (CPS). Through these experiments, the effects of impurities and electrolysis pulse waveforms on the the deposit were clarified. In particular, the difference between the dissolution kinetics of UO2 and PuO2 during the period in which current was stopped was found to be the most important factor influencing the deposition behaviors. As a result, phase electrolysis conditions, which could restrain Pu enrichment of the deposited MOX, were confirmed. Furthermore, it was found that the elemental distribution in the MOX granule obtained by pulse electrolysis was homogenized, which is well suited for nuclear fuel fabrication. Finally, a qualitative model of the pulse electrolysis reaction near the field of the cathode surface is proposed.

It is important from an economic point of view that a non-nuclear-grade, rather than nuclear-grade, IS process plant be built based on conventional chemical plant construction standards. In order to construct the IS process as a conventional chemical plant, some critical safety issues must been studied and clarified prior to the application for safety case review from the government. JAEA has launched R&D for a non-nuclear-grade IS process to be coupled with the HTTR, which is the Japan's first VHTR capable of supplying 900 degrees C secondary helium for process heat application. In this paper, we describe the development scenario for a non-nuclear grade hydrogen production system. Utilizing the HTTR-IS system as a reference system, the R&D map is proposed for the VHTR-IS hydrogen production system.

The isotopic ratios of Cr-50/Cr-52 and Cr-53/Cr-52 were measured precisely by the multi-collector inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). The isotope enrichment factor for Cr-50-Cr-52 isotope pair was shown to vary between 1.5 similar to w2.3 parts per thousand and changed as a function of acidity. The magnitudes of mass-independent isotope fractionation could be attributed to the nuclear field shift effect.

Isotopic analysis was performed by the multi-collector thermal ionization spectrometry (MC-TIMS). Isotope enrichment factor epsilon(86.m) was observed to be, 0.35 +/- 0.20 parts per thousand (m = 84), 0.00 +/- 0.04 parts per thousand (m = 87), or -0.61 +/- 0.23 parts per thousand (m = 88). Reduced partition function ratios due to intermolecular vibrational frequency shifts were estimated by a quantum mechanics simulation. The estimated epsilon(86.84) and epsilon(86.88) showed similar values with those experimentally obtained, while calculated epsilon(86.87) disagreed with the experimental result. These results suggest all existence of mass-independent isotope fractionation which may be due to the nuclear field shift.

O1s core (C=O/OMe) to valence (pi*(CO)/sigma*(O-Me)/sigma*(C-OMe)) excitation bands in the total-ion-yields of methyl acetate were assigned based on the comparison with those of other esters and band-deconvolution analysis. Product branching ratios of CD3+ and CDO+ cations from deuterium-labeled methyl-d(3) acetate (CH3C(O)OCD3) showed that site-selective bond scission takes place between the (O1s(CO)(-1)pi*(CO)) and (O1s(OMe)(-1)pi*(CO)) sites, indicating the dissociation with an antibonding nature after the spectator Auger transitions. Although the efficient production of CDO+ was observed at the (O1s(OMe)(-1)sigma*(C-OMe)) transition, however, no apparent state-selective dissociation of CD3+ could be observed at the (O1s(OMe)(-1)sigma*(O-Me)). The present results indicate that the lack of state-selectivity at the (O1s(OMe)(-1)sigma*(O-Me)) is largely due to the weak band intensity buried into the congestion of core-to-Rydberg transitions.

Especially concerning the determination of low level contaminations of long-lived radioactive isotopes in environmental or technical samples, outstanding specifications have been demonstrated. Nevertheless, there is still an - even increasing - deficiency in the routine application of these techniques. This fact is ascribed to the complexity of operation and the still only limited reliability of the tunable laser systems in use. While fixed frequency lasers have widely conquered almost all fields of basic and applied research and development, the application of tunable and particularly narrow band width lasers is almost exclusively limited to the delicate fields of fundamental research and quantum optical investigations. Thus, routine investigations in the field of isotope sciences are still the domain of all kind of conventional radiometric, mass spectrometric or alternative optical techniques, but widely excluding resonant optical interaction. This review will discuss the state of the art of these resonant laser techniques developed with special emphasis on elemental isotope selective determination techniques, elucidate reasons for the slight stagnation observed in this field and stimulate further possible developments and applications.

Conventional sodium leak detectors have difficulty in measuring small amounts of sodium leak because of the presence of salinity in the atmosphere. In order to overcome this problem, an innovative technology has been developed to selectively detect the radioactive sodium of the primary cooling system using Laser Resonance Ionization Mass Spectrometry (RIMS). This research and development program consists of investigating the detection process of sodium aerosol by RIMS, manufacturing the prototype sodium detection system, and testing its function using an actual radioactive sodium sample, which will be taken from the experimental fast reactor Joyo. The schedule anti the results obtained from the investigation of the sodium leakage detection process are shown in this paper.

About 100 mu g of Am-241 (Am oxide, 99.9%) samples encapsulated in a small vanadium capsule were irradiated in the experimental fast reactor JOYO for 275 effective full power day (EFPD) by the fast neutron flux of 1.08 x 10(15) (No. 69. in the reflector region) and 3.25 x 10(15) (No. 70, at the center core) n.cm(-2)s(-1) (E >= 0.1 MeV). After dissolution of these samples, americium, curium, and plutonium were chemically separated and the isotopic composition was determined by alpha and gamma-ray spectrometries and mass spectroscopy. Am-242m, Am-243, Pu238-242 and Cm242-248 were clearly observed. The isotopic composition of Am-242m exceeded 1.01 at.% for sample No. 69 and 1.48 at.% for No. 70. It was suggested that this difference came from the different rates of neutron capture reaction. The main detected curium isotope Cm-243 was formed through Am-242m,Am-g by the neutron capture of Am-241. The transmutation ratios of americium could be evaluated from these experimental results and were around 7.8% and 11.1% for the sample No. 69 and No. 70, respectively.

Because of losses of optical transmission due to radiation damage in high-level radiation environments, however, both scintillating fibers and normal optical plastic fibers are less applicable to areas of high dose rate. In order to develop a flexible fiber-type radiation sensor with good radiation hardness, we propose to use a liquid light guide, the core of which is replaced by a liquid organic scintillator. A liquid light guide consists of flexible cladding material, and can be easily bent. A liquid organic scintillator can generate a much larger number of photons than the original liquid material, leading to a better detection efficiency than a simple liquid light guide; furthermore, it is not significantly damaged by incident radiation. In preliminary experiments Using a fast neutron beam, we confirmed that our prototype system can be operated as a position-sensitive radiation detector. Fundamental characteristics such as spatial resolution, detection efficiency and attenuation length of light propagation were examined with two detectors of 2 m and 10 in length. Optical transmission losses due to radiation damage were examined using Co-60 gamma rays; no significant transmission loss was observed up to a dose of 1.5 x 10(4) Gy.

A liquid scintillation counter (LSC) and tritium-free water are most commonly used for measuring tritium and estimating the background caused by various sources. Tritium-free water is difficult to obtain and maintain, and developing a method for estimating the background without using tritium-free water is an important contribution. This study establishes such a method using a tritium enrichment operation on tritiated water samples which have several concentration levels. Because the value measured by the LSC is composed of the tritium signal and the background, an enrichment operation will only increase the tritium radiation signal. On this premise, tritiated water samples with several levels of tritium activity were enriched and used to quantify the background statistically.

Obtained diffraction data were analyzed by the Rietveld method and the maximum entropy method. It was found that deuterium atoms were located close to the 12h (0, y, 0.5) site of the cubic perovskite structure (space group Pm (3) over barm). Such deuterium position seems common with many proton-conducting perovskite oxides.
