Particular attention is paid to the development of a method for predicting the concentrations of uranium and nitric acid in the mother liquor and the amount of uranyl nitrate crystals produced. Initial concentrations of uranyl nitrate and nitric acid are 500-600 g/l and 4-6 mol/l, respectively, corresponding to the condition of a dissolver solution of spent fuel. Steady-state mass balance equations including the correlation equation for the equilibrium solubility of uranium nitrate are applied to the prediction. The calculated concentrations of uranium and nitric acid are in close agreement with the experimental ones. The recovery of uranium is accurately predicted by the calculated concentrations, with an error of less than 10%.

Using Ionizing Radiation to Determine Trace Element Content in Living Human Subjects	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Symposium on Radiation Safety and Detection Technology	JUL 18-20, 2007	Hanyang Univ, Seoul, SOUTH KOREA	Innovat Technol Ctr Radiat Safety, Korean Minist Educ, Sci & Technol, Korean Assoc Radiat Protect	Hanyang Univ	x-ray fluorescence; neutron activation; in vivo elemental analysis; Pb; Sr; Cd; Mn; Al	X-RAY-FLUORESCENCE; NEUTRON-ACTIVATION ANALYSIS; CONCENTRATIONS IN-VIVO; BONE LEAD MEASUREMENT; RENAL-FUNCTION; CUMULATIVE EXPOSURE; INVIVO MEASUREMENT; STRONTIUM CONTENT; LIVER CADMIUM; XRF-ANALYSIS	The use of ionizing radiation for medical procedures is very familiar, both for diagnosis, such as in radiography or nuclear medicine, or for therapy, such as external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy. There are also many instances in which samples are analyzed for their elemental content in order to help diagnose or monitor a medical condition or environmental exposure. The use of ionizing radiation to measure the elemental content within the human body directly and non invasively has been developed and is used in a number of laboratories around the world. The in vivo analysis of trace and minor elements in this way has been termed Occupational Nuclear Medicine. There are two general considerations that apply to Occupational Nuclear Medicine procedures. One is that the radiation dose to the subject must be carefully controlled and maintained within acceptable levels in all circumstances. The second is that both the probe that it used to excite a signal from the element of interest and the signal itself must be sufficiently penetrating for the signal to be detected with adequate sensitivity externally to the body. In practice, this means that photons or neutrons are used as the probe and that varieties of x-ray fluorescence and neutron activation are the techniques most commonly used. For in vivo measurements, the use of x-ray fluorescence is confined to elements with relatively high atomic number, because the K shell x-rays are higher in energy and therefore more likely to escape from the body and the K shell fluorescence yield also increases with increasing atomic number. This presentation will examine measurements of both lead (Pb) and strontium (Sr) in bone. Pb is toxic, whereas Sr may confer strength on bone, although it is also damaging at high concentrations. Cadmium (Cd) can be measured in liver and kidney by measuring -rays emitted promptly following neutron capture. Manganese (Mn) or aluminum (Al) can be measured in bone by counting induced radioactivity following neutron absorption. Although Mn is an essential element, it is the toxic effects of each of these elements, associated with chronic exposure and excessive accumulation in the body, that have motivated the development and application of these Occupational Nuclear Medicine techniques.

In February 2007, the dose rate measurements of KN-12 cask were performed in the spent fuel decontamination pit at the KORI Nuclear Power Plant in Korea. The general specifications of spent fuels being loaded into the cask were a burnup of around 33 GWD/MTU, an initial enrichment of 3.4 wt% and cooling times ranging from 15.8 years to 17 years. The discrete measurements were performed at several points for acquiring axial and radial dose rate profiles along the cask's surface. All calculated and measured values showed the far less than dose rate requirements of 2000 mu Sv/h. The C/E ratios for neutron cases were generally about 1.0 similar to 2.8 except for the trunnions regions at cask's side. The C/E ratios in gamma ray cases were about 1.1 similar to 2.7 at cask's side. By this program the shielding integrity test for preservice inspection of KN-12 cask was successfully completed.

The source term originates from a leakage of fission products from the anticipated failed fuels into the gas flow tubes and around the instrumentation and control system. In order to quantify the fuel composition in the event of a fuel failure, the isotope generation and depletion code ORIGEN 2.0 was used. The computer program Microshield 6.2 was used to calculate the doses from specific locations, where a high radioactivity is expected during an irradiation. The results indicate that the equivalent dose in the investigated working areas is less than the permitted dose rate of 6.25 mu Sv/hr. However, access to the area of a decay vessel may need to be limited and the installation of a Pb wall with a 20.5 cm thickness is recommended. From the analysis of a radioactive decay with time, most of the concerned gaseous nuclides with short half-lives after 3 months, were decayed, with one exception which was Kr-85, thus it should be released in accordance with applicable government laws after measuring its activity in individual holding vessels.

The probability of a criticality accident in PCDF is extremely low. However, the criticality accident alarm system (CAAS) has been in place since 1982 to reduce the radiation dose to workers in case of such a rare criticality accident. The CAAS contains criticality accident detector units (CADs), one unit consisting of three plastic scintillation detectors, and using the 2 out of 3 voting system for the purpose of high reliability. Currently, eight CADs are installed in PCDF evaluating the dose using a simple equation allowing for a safety margin. The purpose of this study is to show the determination procedures for the adequate relocation of the CADs which adequately ensures safety in PCDF.

In this study, we consider the dose rates of photons and neutrons at working places, where a worker may be exposed to the radiations during the machine operation near a target room. A radiation shielding configuration for the target is designed optimally by estimating radiation dose rates of photons and neutrons with respect to various shielding materials, which are used to reduce the radiation dose rates below acceptable limits. In this proposed model, the proton beam line from the accelerator to the target is constructed in tunnel under the ground. A pathway to the target room is designed with a width of 1.7 meters for workers accessing to the machine. The radiation shielding walls were consisted of concrete blocks including lead stacked with a dimension of 0.8 meters thickness. To ensure the distribution of the radiation dose beyond the shielding walls, we allocated the pathway into 15 different points for the purpose of visualizing the variations of dose rate.

We suggest a radiation shielding design scheme to reduce the Ar-41 production rate in each target room of the Beam Application Research Area (BARA). Analyses were performed for the ventilation system design of Proton Engineering Frontier Project (PEFP). According to the analyses results, the radioactivity production rate in the accelerator tunnel is saturated at 5.57x10(-3) Bq/cm(3) in 16 h without a ventilation system operation, which satisfies the regulatory limits. In the target rooms of the BARA, the radioactivity production rate is reduced within the range from 329Bq/cm(3) to 5.19 Bq/cm(3) by the proposed ventilation system for the PEFP radiation shielding scheme.

The level of a specific radioactivity is also one of the important factors for determining the RCS volume. SMART reactor which is in the process of being developed consists of 69 fuel assemblies with a 660Mw thermal output. The reactor core has 2 batch fuel assemblies with a 30 month cycle and the effective full power days of the equilibrium cycle are 822 days. The specific activities of the SMART reactor primary coolant due to fission products were evaluated by using the SAEP code. The SAEP code can be applied to an integral reactor such as SMART as well as the current commercial PWRs in existence. The ORIGEN2 code is integrated into the SAEP as a subroutine, to solve the inhomogeneous differential equations which are used to determine the coolant activities. From the evaluation results, the specific activities of the SMART primary coolant due to fission products were compared with those of UCN 5&6 primary coolant with the same purification rate condition; they are averagely 25% of those of UCN 5&6. They are also inversely proportional to the RCS volume for almost all radioisotopes except the isotopes with a long half-life. Therefore, it is found that there is a possibility of reducing the RCS volume.

The activation method and the stacked-foil technique using the high-resolution HPGe gamma spectrometry were applied to determine the production cross-sections. The beam current was determined by the monitor reactions Cu-nat(p,x)Zn-62 and Al-27(p,x)Na-22,Na-24. This work reports new data for the above reactions. The results were also compared with ALICE-IPPE model calculations compiled in MENDL-2P file. This experiment is in partial agreement with model calculations. The Optimum energy range for the production of Y-86 is 40 - 30 MeV. The highest yield of Y-86 amounts to 33.37 MBq/mu Ah over this energy range and the levels of the Y-87, Y-87m and Y-88 impurities to 2.3, 26.55 and 0.33 %, respectively at EOB. The Zr-nat(p,x) process may be a suitable route for the production of the medically important radioisotope Y-86.	[Uddin, M.

They are called "difficult-to-measure" radio nuclei. Among them I-129 is a long-lived beta-emitting isotope with a half-life of 1.57 x 10(7) years. Iodine compounds are mobile in the vadose zone and groundwater and increase a significant long-term risk. Transmutation of I-129 is a challenging issue in nuclear waste management and disposal. If I-129 is transmuted into I-128 (half life; 25 minutes), it can easily be measured by a Ge detector. However, the I-129(gamma, n) reaction cross section has not been measured so far. In this study we have measured the inclusive I-129(gamma, n)I-128 cross section by using bremsstrahlung photons. The bremsstrahlung photons were produced from a 30-MeV electron linac. Measured average activation cross section agrees with 12% deviation from the evaluated one in the IAEA photonuclear data library.

The radioisotope was instantaneously injected into a river as a point source by means of an underwater glass-vial crusher. The detection was made with 60 2inch Nal(TI) scintillation detectors bound to 6 transverse lines at a downstream position. The multi-channel data acquisition systems, specifically fabricated by the research group for field studies, collected and processed the detection signals transmitted from the detectors. Transverse dispersion coefficient was determined by a moment method on the basis of field measurement data. As a result, the averaged transverse coefficients were 0.25 for S-River and 0.24 for H-River. This result was compared with the conventional values calculated with the empirically proposed formulas and its physical meaning is discussed.

It has 64 implanted and readout strips with a strip pitch of 500 mu m. Two silicon strip sensors were mounted perpendicularly one another to get two-dimensional position information with a 5 mm space gap. Two low noise analog ASICs, VA 1 chips, were used for signal readout of the strip sensor. The single-sided silicon strip detector (SSSD) consists of the two AC-coupled single-sided strip sensors and readout electronics. The SSSD was housed in an Al light-tight box. A CsI(Tl) scintillation crystal and a 2-in. photomultiplier tube were used to trigger signal events. The data acquisition systems were based on a 64 MHz FADC and control softwares for the PC-Linux platform. Experiments were performed at room temperature and silicon sensors were fully depleted. The SNRs were measured to be 29.1 +/- 2.2 and 26.4 +/- 0.3, respectively, for a 45 MeV proton beam and a Sr-90 radioactive source. Imaging tests were performed using a Pb phantom with a Sr-90 radioactive source and a 45 MeV proton beam, respectively. From the two-dimensional hit distribution, the phantom images were obtained and the position resolution was estimated to be about 240 mu m.

The large crystal was coupled with a green-extended Photomultiplier tube (PMT) and tested at room temperature. We measured light yield and energy resolution of the crystal using various radioactive sources. The energy resolutions of the CdWO4 crystal were obtained to be 9.5% and 5.3% for 662 keV and 2614 keV, respectively. Linearity of the crystal in different gamma-ray energy was also measured. In the environmental background spectrum, well defined peaks of 1461 keV by K-40 decay and 2614 keV by Tl-208 decay were identified. A simulation study with GEANT4 package was performed for the efficiency comparison with commonly used Nal(TI) crystal scintillators. The study showed that the CdWO4 crystal is the promising candidate for the boarder control and energetic X-and gamma-ray detection equipment.	[Kim, H.

The imaging system consists of a commercially-available CMOS pixel array of a 100 x 100 mu m(2) pixel size and a 5.4 x 151.0 mm(2) active area, coupled with a 750-mu m-thick CdTe photoconductor, and a collimated selenium (Se-75) radioisotope of an about 2.3 x 10(12) Bq activity and a physical size of 3.0 mm in diameter. In this study, we, for the first time, succeeded in obtaining useftil gamma images of several test phantoms with the 75 Se radioisotope from the imaging system and evaluated its imaging performance in terms of the line spread function (LSF), the modulation transfer function (MTF), the noise power spectrum (NPS), and the detective quantum efficiency (DQE). For comparison, we also tested its X-ray imaging performance with a microfocus X-ray tube of an about 5 pm focal spot size at an operation condition of 90 kV(p) and 100 mu A. According to our test results, the designed imaging system seems to be promising for our ongoing application of nondestructive testings, provided that the effective source size of the 75 Se radioisotope can be further limited.

Spent fuel standards (SFS) are usually used to calibrate the neutron coincidence counter for nuclear material measurements of spent fuel. To make the best selection and minimize the measurement uncertainty of neutron coincidence counter for the SFS, expected measurement errors for several kinds of burnups were obtained by using the ORIGEN-S code and the expected singles and doubles count rates were also acquired by using MCNPX code. The expected doubles count errors for I pellet of spent fuel are less than 4% for a burnup from 27 to 40 GWD/MtU. Considering everything, a higher burnup of the spent fuel seems to be better to obtain more accurate data from a nuclear material measurement by using a neutron coincidence counter than that of a lower burnup.

CdZnTe has wide band gap energy as 1.6 eV and can provide high quantum efficiency with reasonably good energy resolution at room temperature. This study is aimed at determining radionuclide analysis ability by measuring energy resolution of CZT detector which will be applied at nuclear material identification purpose. For experiment we used a CZT detector (5 x 5 x 5 mm 3) which is manufactured by eV Products. We have performed our measurement at varied temperatures similar to the outdoor environment for the investigation about temperature dependence of energy resolution and peak centroid fluctuation of CZT detector by using gas cooling and Peltier cooling methods. In order to test radionuclide identification we used various radionuclide samples; plutonium, europium and other standard sources. Pulse height spectra were obtained by standard electronics which consists of a preamplifier, a shaping amplifier, and a multi-channel analyzer.

From the nuclide analysis results for a filter medium part through pre-treatment of it, it was possible to obtain three kinds of typical distributions in view of the distribution of the captured nuclides in the filter medium. When considering these distribution characteristics of the captured radionuclide, the region showing the high concentration of the captured nuclides was the intake or the outlet part of the HEPA filter. On the other side, the middle part generally represented a uniform distribution below the average concentration of the captured nuclides. Therefore, in the event of taking a representative sample of a HEPA filter at the intake and the outlet part, the results of a nuclide analysis for that sample could be estimated as existing in the range from 1.0 to 1.5 times the real concentration of the nuclides captured by a filter medium. As a result, to conduct a radionuclide assessment of a spent HEPA filter without a dismantlement of it, the analysis results for a representative sample taken from both the intake and the outlet part of a spent HEPA filter could be regarded as an average value for the corresponding HEPA filter.

We have established the monitoring methodologies for these nuclides, to realize an appropriate and continuous radioactive discharge control. The methodologies having various special technical considerations for matching the monitoring of reprocessing off-gas, were summarized in this paper, Briefly, 3 H was collected by a cold-trap technique and the concentration was evaluated being independent of the water collection efficiency; C-14 was collected by a monoethanolamine bubbler and then measured by liquid scintillation counting without any interferences from H-3 and Kr-85; Kr-85 was continuously measured by combination of two kinds of detectors to cover very wide range of the concentration; and I-129 was collected by a charcoal filter and a charcoal cartridge in series with a relatively high collecting performance. The monitoring records over the period from the start of operation to fiscal 2006, the end of contract-based reprocessing, certainly ensured that the releases of these nuclides from the TRP have never exceeded the authorized discharge limits.

It has storage density more than twice larger than silo type which stands alone. The storage module can accommodates 40 cylinders in 4 rows of 10, with 24 located close to periphery of the module and 16 located internally at some distance from the peripheral walls. As for IAEA Safeguards, the module is equipped with a comprehensive set of receptacles into which the IAEA can install seals and verification equipment. The Safeguards equipment, coupled with related measures for physical protection, will facilitate the timely detection of any diversion of significant quantities of nuclear material from the spent fuels stored in the modules. Nevertheless, due to its generic design feature it makes very difficult to provide re-verification of the loaded or under loaded cylinders inside module. along with an unattended monitoring system re-verification is an IAEA safeguard requirement to measure the gamma dose rate and spectrum of each irradiated fuel basket once the storage cylinders are loaded with spent fuel. The gamma profile is read by lowering a detector inside the tube so that it can be registered at the level of each basket. For the 24 peripheral storage cylinders this method of measurement is retained on the side wall of the module. However, an alternate method is required for the 16 internal dry fuel storage cylinders since they are located some distance from the module walls and thus surrounded by storage cylinders.

The sensor head is prepared in two sizes: the larger one has the size 4.7mm x 4.7mm x 10mm and the smaller one has the size 2.2mm x 2.2mm x 10mm. A low attenuation plastic optical fiber with 3mm diameter and 10m length is attached to the square surface of the larger scintillator, and the same optical fiber with 2mm diameter is attached to the smaller one. The polished scintillator is wrapped with white Teflon tape, and the fiber is shielded with a thermal shrink tube to block the ambient light. The lights generated in the sensor head are detected by a pulse-type photomultiplier tube module. Co-60 sources with radioactivity of 50 mu Ci and 1mCi are used to test the performance of the constructed dosimeter models. The total number of pulses is measured as a function of the distance from the sensor head to the source. MCNPX simulation is also carried out for the source and dosimeter arrangements to assess the feasibility of the dosimeter model. The dosimeter model measures fairly well the change in the number of pulses as the source-to-detector distance changes, but shows poor capability to measure the pulse height spectrum and source activity.

Silicon sensors of various types were fabricated on a 380 mu m-thick n-type, float zone, 5 in. wafer which has high resistivity, < 100 > orientation, and is double-sided polished. We manufactured not only DC- and AC-coupled strip sensors but also pixel sensors and RC chips. The RC chips were fabricated for the purpose of using signal readout of the DC-coupled strip sensors. Electrical characteristics of the fabricated silicon sensors, leakage current and capacitance as a function of reverse bias voltage, were measured. Coupling capacitors and biasing resistors in the AC-coupled strip sensors were made by separating implantation from metallization strips with a thin oxide layer and made of polysilicons, respectively. The capacitance and resistance of each channel in the AC-coupled sensor were measured and compared with target values. The signal-to-noise ratio of the fabricated large pixel sensor was also measured by using a Sr-90 radioactive source.

The grown crystal was cut into a size of 10x10x10 mm(3). The lattice parameter of the grown crystal is a = b = c = 7.041 angstrom and the crystal structure is cubic. The luminescence and scintillation properties of the Ba0.20Sr0.80Cl2 crystal were studied. The luminescent characteristics were measured with ultraviolet (UV) light and X-ray source to study the emission spectra of the crystal. Scintillation properties of the crystal such as pulse height spectra, energy resolution, alpha/beta ratio, light output, proportionality curve, and fluorescence decay time were measured with the various radioactive gamma-ray sources and alpha-source at room temperature. The light output of the crystal was compared with that of the CsI(Tl) crystal and the absolute light output was measured with avalanche photodiode (APD). While the light output of the crystal was less than that of the CsI(Tl), the energy resolution was approximately 6.9% for Cs-137 662 keV gamma-ray with PMT which is similar to that of the CsI(Tl) crystal for (CS)-C-137 gamma-rays.

The gamma radiation levels thus measured are regularly compared with the pre-operational levels. The data generated for all the stations during the past years was subjected to various analyses like comparison of the annual levels with those during the pre operational levels, distribution studies, regressions with the possible contributors etc. This paper discusses the environmental gamma radiation levels based on the analyses of all data generated for all the power stations during the years up to 2005. Comparisons of the annual radiation levels with those during the pre operational data indicates that none of the stations show any increase in the environmental gamma radiation levels.

This paper presents an approach taken by Malaysian Nuclear Agency (Nuclear Malaysia) and authority to develop and implement safety culture for industries that uses radioactive material and radiation sources. Maintaining and improving safety culture is a continuous process. There is a need to establish a program to measure, review and audit health and safety performance against predetermined standards. Proper safety audit will help to identify the non-compliance of safety culture as well as the deviation of management, individual and policy level commitment; review of radiation protection program and activities should be preceded.

The radioactive contaminated soil sample was pulverized, Pu-239 was separated and determined by isotope dilution introduced coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, and gamma emitters, Am-241 and Cs-137 etc were measured by the gamma spectrometry. The dependence of the time taken during the milling and consequent mesh size, and the relationship between the weight of aliquot for radiochemical analysis and the mesh size of the soil were established, under the supposed representativeness criteria of (1) the relative standard deviation (RSD) less than 20% and (2) the deviation from certificated value (DCV) less than 10%. An empirical equation of the aliquot weight and size was fitted, by which the optimum size is 40mesh when circa 180 g is used for gamma measurement, and the preference size is 150 mesh when the aliquot for the radioanalysis around 2 g soil is scooped for assay. These results could be used in the assay of the soil samples in the radiological survey.

Measurements of radionuclides were carried out in atmospheric, terrestrial and aquatic environmental compartments using state-of art techniques and radiological impact due to external exposure, ingestion, inhalation and skin absorption pathways to individual member of public evaluated. A hypothetical case of OBT intake through contamination of crops due to tritium is also considered. The paper also presents the results of estimation of Site Specific Transfer Factors required for the impact assessment modeling. The parameters required for dose evaluation and respective uncertainties for each parameter were attributed. The dose distribution was estimated using parameter uncertainty analysis from all the pathways and for all the major radionuclides. Dose distribution was found to be lognormal and ranges from 0.2 - 5.8 mu Sv.a(-1) (at 95% Confidence) with a mean value of 1.1 mu Sv.a(-1) in the year 2006. Since the upper limit of 95% confidence level is below the regulatory limit, violation of the limit is highly unlikely. Statistical analysis of Cs-137 concentration in soil and sediment samples indicate that there is no build up of Cs-137 in the environment as compared to pre-operational value (p<0.001).	[Ravi, P.

Six-time samplings of rice and air were performed in seven fields from rice planting to harvest, and the measurements of C-14 content were made by using liquid scintillation counter on the air and each of available parts of the rice such as root, stem, crust and ear. The results illustrated that C-14 showed a relatively even distribution among parts of rice during the growth period implying C-14 accumulation was more dependent on interactions among the parts such as transportation of nutrients than on photosynthesis occurring only in stem that has chlorophyll. Also it was observed that the difference of C-14 concentration between each part of rice and the air decreased with time indicating that the time was needed for C-14 to reach equilibrium between both sides. The radius within which C-14 released from the Wolsong plant could have a significant effect on the C-14 concentrations of the parts was observed to be about 5 km.

Some parts of the shielding concrete of the KRR-2 were activated by a thermal neutron reaction during operation of the reactor. The levels of gamma and beta-emitting radionuclides in the dismantled concrete are required to be measured and evaluated. The samples were collected from the inner surface to 90 cm horizontal depth on one side of the shielding concrete. The gamma-emitting radionuclides in the activated concrete were analyzed by using HPGe spectrometer. The radioactivities of H-3 and C-14 were determined by a commercially available tube furnace and liquid scintillation counter and Fe-55 and Ni-63 by a combined method of an extraction chromatography and a liquid scintillation analysis, A correlation of the measurement results based on the Co-60 radioactivity was investigated to estimate the radioactivity level of the activated concrete. The radioactivities of H-3 and 55Fe in the dismantled concrete revealed a good correlation with that of Co-60. The correlation formulas are y = 0.77x + 1.68 (r=0.984) and y = 0.96x +1.26 (r=0.995), respectively. In the case of C-14, the correlation is represented as y = 0.60x -1.82 (r=0.998) in the higher range of activity.

The following samples among the imported foodstuffs were selected from open markets; one group is imported foodstuffs and the other group is domestic foodstuffs produced from around nuclear facilities. These included imported samples from a country associated with the Chernobyl nuclear accident, samples produced around nuclear power plants or nuclear tests, and foodstuffs reported as radioactively contaminated materials in a foreign country. After pretreatments such as a drying and homogenization, the samples were analyzed. Only the Cs-137 radionuclide was measured from among the regulation radionuclides((CS)-C-137, Cs-134, I-131) of the Korea food code. All foodstuffs except Inonotus Obliquus (Chaga mushooms) were less than 25.24 Bq/kg or below the minimum detectable activity (MDA). The average activity concentrations of 203 mushroom samples was 38.60 Bq/kg but the effective dose was also far less than 1 mSv/yr. Based on the radiological dose assessments and surveys of a radioactive contamination, the radioactivity of the domestic and imported foodstuffs has not shown any significant levels during recent years in Korea.

As these wastes have been stored for more than 18 years, some of them can be regulatory cleared. Before such a regulatory clearance, the radiological characteristics of these wastes should be analyzed first. And based on the analysis result, radiological dose should be estimated to confirm the safety of a disposal of these cleared wastes. In this study, a working procedure for a representative sampling and analysis of the wastes was developed. According to the analysis result, Co-60 and Cs-137 were major radionuclides while some wastes were contaminated with Mn-54, Fe-59, I-131, Cs-134 or Eu-152 of an extremely low concentration. The analysis results show that about 75% of wastes have a radioactivity concentration below 0.1 Bq/g and were considered for a clearance. It was assumed that radiation workers are exposed by the inhalation dose and the external dose. The radiological dose was estimated using the RESRAD code for the disposal workers and the management workers as 5.32 mu Sv/yr and 3.13 mu Sv/yr for an individual dose and 1.60E-4 man.Sv/yr and 3.13E-5 man-Sv/yr for a public dose, respectively.

The grain, vegetable, milk, and water, which the inhabitants generally ate or drunk, were sampled to reflect the dose effects. And TLD (Thermoluminescence dosimeter) was used for measuring the external dose in the sampled area. An external exposure includes die accumulated gamma dose measured by TLD and an internal exposure includes an ingestion of the food, and an inhalation of the air and radon gas, The radionuclides such as (CS)-C-137, Be-7, K-40 as well as U-238 were included for measuring the radioactivity concentrations of the samples. Radioactivity concentrations for the samples were calculated as averaged annual values. The effective dose by TLD analysis was similar to die domestic average when considering that it was between 0.63 mSv/y and 0.71 mSv/y. The Rn-222 concentration of indoor air significantly contributed to the total effective dose where the concentration of these uranium belt regions was more or less higher than the average domestic one. This study revealed that the dose level for the inhabitants of the uranium rich regions in Korea was similar to that of the other regions except for the effect by radon.

Currently, the Korean Atomic Energy Act and relevant regulation comply with the international recommendation of the sources/practices meeting an individual dose criterion 10 mu Sv/y and a collective dose criterion of less than 1 man.Sv/y. A variety of radionuclides was generated in the biological shield concrete by a neutron reaction during the operation of a reactor. The specific activities of these radionuclides were measured by using the developed methods and procedures. For the evaluation of a radiological dose, seven scenarios were selected which encompassed a realistic situation of a recycling such as a road construction and landfill disposal route. The external and internal exposure doses of each scenario were calculated by using the MCNP4C code and a mathematical model respectively. The dose assessment regarding the residents and industrial workers was evaluated by using the RESRAD code for the landfill disposal scenario. The maximum individual dose rate was 7.21 mu Sv/y and the maximum collective dose was 0.05 man. Sv/yr for the landfill disposal scenario.

The primary coolant water was collected during 30 MW operation of HANARO. The variation of activity concentrations of several radionuclides in the water with the cooling time were continually measured using the HPGe detection system. The nuclides of interest were Ar-41, Xe-133 and iodine nuclides. The effective half-life of Ar-41 in the water sample was measured to be 0.65 +/- 0.02 hours, and its elimination half-life due to the gasification and surface exchange coefficient were determined to be 1.01 hours and 6.89x10(-4) cm s(-1), respectively. For Xe-133, the elimination half-life due to the gasification and surface exchange coefficient were deter-mined to be 1.44 days and 2.27x10(-5) cm s(-1), respectively. For iodine nuclides, the measured effective half-lives were similar to their radioactive half-lives. Therefore, it is confirmed that the gasification of the iodine nuclide from the pool water is negligible unless the evaporation of water occurs. Above data for the gasification of several nuclides will be very useful for the assessment of the research reactor safety.

It uses the PSA technology to be classified into three phases, which involve first the failure probability assessment phase for a basket and a cylinder. And secondly the possible accident scenarios in the spent fuel dry storage facility are identified. Lastly the accident consequence analysis has been done by the MACCS code. The phase of the analysis includes the quantitative assessment for the failure probability by modeling of the basket and the cylinder, which is the major element of containing radioactive substances. It also evaluates the probability that radioactive substances are released to outside when the initial event happens by applying the construction of the event tree methods. It describes a various heading elements that affect the air inlet blockage accident mitigation. And also using the released radioactive substances, the radiation damage to affect neighborhood and workers, is quantitatively evaluated. It is shown that this framework developed in this study can be applied to assess the synthetic safety for any other dry storage facilities.

The system dynamics methodology has been applied to predict the time-dependent behaviors such as feedback and dependency as well as to model uncertain behavior of complex physical system. It is used to construct the transfer mechanisms of time dependent radioactivity concentration and to evaluate them. Dynamic variations of radio activities are simulated by considering several effects such as deposition, weathering, washout, re-suspension, root uptake, translocation, leaching, senescence, intake, and excretion of soil. The time-dependent radio-ecological model applicable to Korean specific environment has been developed in order to assess the radiological consequences following the short-term deposition of radio-nuclides during severe accidents nuclear power plant. An ingestion food chain model can estimate time dependent radioactivity concentrations in foodstuffs. And it is also shown that the system dynamics approach is useful for analyzing the phenomenon of the complex system as well as the behavior of structure values with respect to time. The output of this model (Bq ingested per Bq m(-2) deposited) may be multiplied by the deposition and a dose conversion factor (Gy Bq(-1)) to yield organ-specific doses. The model may be run deterministically to yield a single estimate or stochastic distributions by "Monte-Carlo" calculation that reflects uncertainty of parameter and model uncertainties. The results of this study may contribute to identifying the relative importance of various parameters occurred in consequence analysis, as well as to assessing risk reduction effects in accident management.

A demand for lengthening the life time of disposal site needs treatment of spent nuclear fuel to reduce the volume of high level radwaste. This study is for trapping the tritium gas during dry processes carried out in oxygen condition, having a potential of exposure into operators and environment. The experiments were performed into two different hydrogen concentration ranges, i.e. 1000 similar to 9000 ppm of high range of hydrogen concentration and 25 similar to 100 ppm of low range of hydrogen concentration. At high range of hydrogen concentration, H2O conversion ratio at 400 degrees C indicated above 98% up to 7000 ppm, and 100% at 450 degrees C. All the results of H2O conversion ratio at the low range of hydrogen concentration are represented close to 99%. Converted H2O vapor was adsorbed at the Molecular sieve close to 100%. More than 98% of H2O conversion ratio was attained up to 4 cm/s of linear gas velocity, whereas over 99% for the low range of hydrogen concentration. Some catalytic effect of ability of conversion hydrogen into H2O on stainless steel was studied.

A disk-shaped radiation source was developed by compressing sinter powder. Ten disk-shaped radiation sources were fabricated by this method and their weight, thickness, mass density, and radioactivity were determined. The results indicated that special skills or techniques are not required for production of a radiation source with this method, and the production method is robust. Thus, the method is suitable for the simultaneous fabrication of multiple uniform radiation sources. To evaluate the ability of this fabrication method to produce sinter radiation sources applicable to courses involving radiation protection or similar investigations, the dependence of the radiation count rate on distance, shielding thickness, and shielding materials was examined using a conventional GM survey meter. The results showed that the sinter radiation source is suitable to comprehend characteristics of radiation and principle of radiation protection related to distance and shielding.

The Database of the SF has 255 of radioactivity data on 6 waste streams from 20 NPPs. If the SF can be applicable to any wastes regardless of their generation year, then it can be applied all over the wastes from the past NPP wastes to the future ones. For the purpose, KHNP has planned to obtain the second SF through 337 samples from the same wastes as the first ones from 2007 to 2008. The second SF will be a principal key to verify the validity of the first SF for Korean NPP wastes. The first and the second SF will be unified to one SF in case of completion of verification. The wastes produced before the first SF was derived also have to be verified that it has the same correlation to the unified SF. In this study, 8 solidified evaporated bottom waste drums produced from 1988 to 2003 were cored and the radioactivities were analyzed. The SFs were compared with the first SF and proved that the SF can be applied all over the wastes from the past NPP wastes to the future ones in case of the solidified evaporated bottom waste drums.

Using Monte Carlo methods to estimate efficiencies of gamma-ray emitters with complex geometries	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								In the event of a radioactive disaster, one of the biggest tasks is to estimate the radiation dosage received by people to determine the actions of emergency response teams. The first and the most rapid screening method of internally contaminated people in case of an emergency response is to perform in-vivo measurements for gamma-emitters. Development of virtual gamma-ray calibration techniques will be critical for emergency invivo measurements because there are inadequate numbers of phantom types to approximate all body shapes and sizes. The purpose of this project was to find a reliable way to estimate the efficiency of gamma-systems using Monte Carlo computations, and to validate that efficiency by making measurements of a standard geometry. Two geometries, a 5-ml ampoule and a Bottle Manikin Absorption (BOMAB) phantom head, spiked with Ga-67 were used as standard geometries. The radioactive objects are measured at a number of distances from a high purity germanium (HPGe) detector, and the experimental efficiency for our gamma-spectrometry system is determined. The same set of experiments was then modeled using the Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport Code (MCNP). The conclusion of this project is that computationally derived detector efficiency calibrations can be comparable to those derived experimentally from physical standards.

A review of recent developments in self-attenuation correction leading to a simple dual energy lump correction model for use in the quantitative gamma assay of plutonium	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							RAY SPECTROMETRY; URANIUM	The application of quantitative high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometry for the non-destructive assay of plutonium bearing items, such as waste drums, is complicated by self-attenuation if the plutonium is present as lumps. By definition, lumps are small compared to the bulk matrix and so are not accounted for in the gross matrix correction yet can exert a significant influence on the assay result. Compared to a calibration using dilute standards, self-attenuation results in an under-reporting of the mass of plutonium present. The availability of representative standards is unrealistic for diverse waste streams and so a means to detect and compensate for the presence of lumps is needed. An experimental approach that can in principle generate an item specific correction factor is to exploit the differential attenuation between a set of gamma-lines of known relative emission intensity. In the case of routine measurements of drummed Pu wastes the choice of lines is often limited, the most appropriate often being those at 129 keV and 414 keV from Pu-239. This paper discusses the problems and potential of exploiting this pairing in a simple dual energy approach to the long standing and challenging problem of self-attenuation.	[Croft, S.; McElroy, R.

Comparison of portable detectors for uranium enrichment measurements	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								Uranium enrichment and holdup measurements require a detector capable of accurately obtaining the 186-keV peak area. NaI detectors have been widely used for these tasks. However, for recycled uranium, the interference of the 239-keV peak from the U-232 decay chain challenges the capabilities of the NaI detectors to accurately extract the area of the 186-keV peak. Using CZT detectors, which have much better resolution than the NaI detectors, has temporarily solved this interference problem. However, the CZT detectors have setbacks in that they are generally small and have low efficiencies, which require long acquisition times for reasonable statistics. Recently, two new types of scintillator detectors have become available commercially, LaCl3(Ce) and LaBr3(Ce). These cerium-doped lanthanum halide detectors, with comparable resolution but better efficiency than the CZT detectors, appear to permanently solve the interference problem for recycled uranium measurements. In this report, we compare the uranium enrichment measurement performances of a portable NaI detector, a large coplanar-grid CZT detector, and a LaBr3 detector.
