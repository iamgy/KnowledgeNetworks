Understanding UCN production in solid D-2: The generalized density of states measured via inelastic neutron scattering	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Workshop on Particle Physics with Slow Neutrons	MAY 29-31, 2008	Inst Laue Langevin, Grenoble, FRANCE	Inst Natl Phys Nucl & Phys Particules, CNRS, Univ Joseph Fourier, Excellence Cluster Origin & Struct Universe	Inst Laue Langevin	Neutron; Phonons; Ultra-cold neutrons (UCN); UCN production	ULTRACOLD NEUTRONS; TIME; HYDROGEN; COLD	The dynamics of solid deuterium [H. Nielsen, et all., Phys. Rev. B 7 (1973) 1626] (sD(2)) is studied by means of inelastic thermal neutron scattering (coherent and incoherent scattering) at different temperatures and para-ortho ratios. In this paper, the results for the generalized density of states (GDOS) are presented and discussed. The measurements were performed at the thermal time-of-flight (TOF) instrument IN4 at the ILL Grenoble, and at the cold neutron TOF instrument TofTof at the FIRM II. The GDOS contains beside the hcp phonon excitations of the sD(2) the rotational transition J = 0 -> 1 and 1 -> 2. The measured and expected intensities of these rotational excitations are strongly depended on the ortho concentration in the sD(2). Above E = 10meV there are still strong excitations, which are very likely smeared out higher energy optic phonons and multiphonon contributions. An empirical method of separation of the one- and multiphonon contributions to the GDOS will be presented and discussed. The impact of these measurements on the UCN production in sD(2) will be shown in detail. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Gutsmiedl, E.; Frei, A.; Mueller, A.

Ultra cold neutron production by multiphonon processes in superfluid helium under pressure	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Workshop on Particle Physics with Slow Neutrons	MAY 29-31, 2008	Inst Laue Langevin, Grenoble, FRANCE	Inst Natl Phys Nucl & Phys Particules, CNRS, Univ Joseph Fourier, Excellence Cluster Origin & Struct Universe	Inst Laue Langevin	Ultracold neutron production; Superfluid helium; Helium under pressure	SOLID DEUTERIUM SOURCE; LIQUID-HELIUM; HE-4; UCN; EXCITATIONS; SCATTERING; DEPENDENCE	Cold neutrons are converted to ultra cold neutrons (UCN) by the excitation of a single phonon or multiphonons in superfluid helium. The dynamic scattering function S(q, (h) over bar omega) of the superfluid helium strongly depends on pressure, leading to a pressure-dependent differential UCN production rate. A phenomenological expression for the multiphonon part of the scattering function s(lambda) describing UCN production has been derived from inelastic neutron scattering data. When combined with the production rate from single phonon processes this allows us to calculate the UCN production for any incident neutron flux. For calculations of the UCN production from single phonon processes we propose to use the values S* = 0.118(8) at saturated vapour pressure and S* = 0.066(6) at 20 bar. As an example we will calculate the expected UCN production rate at the cold neutron beam for fundamental physics PF1b at the Institut Laue Langevin. We conclude that UCN production in superfluid helium under pressure is not attractive. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Schmidt-Wellenburg, P.; Andersen, K.

The essential elements are a pulsed proton beam with highest intensity (I-p >= 2 mA) and a low duty cycle (1%), a lead spallation target, a large D2O moderator and a solid deuterium (sD(2)) converter system. Spallation neutrons are thermalized in the D2O, further cooled and partially downscattered into the ultra-cold neutron range in the sD(2). The expected UCN density is higher than 1000 UCN/cm(3) in typical experiments, an increase of almost two orders of magnitude over the best source currently available (at ILL). The new UCN source is expected to come into operation in 2009. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It can be realized within the thermal column situated close to the reactor core. With its large diameter of 1 m, this channel allows to install a 15-cm-thick bismuth shielding, a graphite premoderator (300 dm(3) at 20 K), and a superfluid helium converter (35 dm(3)). At a temperature of 1.2 K it is possible to remove the heat release power of about 20W. Using 4 pi flux of cold neutrons within the reactor column can bring more than a factor 100 of cold neutron flux incident on the superfluid helium with respect to the present cold neutron beam conditions at the ILL reactor. The storage lifetime for UCN in superfluid He at 1.2 K is about 30 s, which is sufficient when feeding experiments requiring a similar filling time. The calculated density of UCN with energy between 50 and 230 neV in an experimental volume of 401 is about 10(4) n/cm(3). Technical solutions for realization of the project are discussed.

Reconstruction of a radiation point source's radial location using goodness-of-fit test on spectra obtained from an HPGe detector	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						High purity germanium (HPGe) detectors; Spatial reconstruction; Low background; Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) goodness-of-fit test	POSITION	High purity germanium (HPGe) detectors are ubiquitous in nuclear physics experiments and are also used in numerous low radioactive background detectors. The effect of the position of (60)Co and (137)Cs point sources on the shape of spectra were studied with Monte Carlo and HPGe detector measurements. We briefly confirm previous work on the position dependence of relative heights of peaks. Spectra taken with the radiation sources placed at locations around the detector were then compared using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) goodness-of-fit test. We demonstrate that with this method the Compton continuum spectral shape has good sensitivity to the radial location of a point source, but poor angular resolution. We conclude with a study of the position reconstruction accuracy as a function of the number of counts from the source. Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Evans, L. T.; Andre, K.; Henning, R.; Morgan, E.

The emission of bremsstrahlung is treated as exactly as possible by the introduction of EGS4 results. The bremsstrahlung production data by pair-created electrons per pair creation reaction and Compton scattered electrons per Compton scattering are evaluated for 26 elements from hydrogen to uranium and four compounds and mixtures of water, concrete, air, and lead glass. The error estimation of bremsstrahlung contribution to buildup factors by the invariant embedding (IE) method coupled with these bremsstrahlung data is coincident with fully transported results by the EGS4 code within similar to 5%. By the introduction of bremsstrahlung production data into IE methods, we can calculate buildup factors included by the contribution of those with good accuracy up to deep penetration. By the interpolation and mixture of bremsstrahlung production data for each element, we can evaluate the data of the element or mixture whose data are not evaluated by the EGS4 code.

We demonstrate that radiation transport analysis yielded a spectrum unfolding strategy based on the energy structure of the BUGLE-96 cross-section library, with 47 neutron energy groups. The initial computational model used is an isotropic planar source incident on a block of high-density polyethylene moderator. Assuming 3He is diluted throughout the moderator, the (3)He(n,p) reaction rate energy group matrix in the block was computed using a completely "flat" neutron source spectrum. Analyzing the energy group matrix, there are neutrons from specific collections of energy groups (energy "bands") that induce a maximum reaction rate in specific locations; we determined that these groups cannot be further differentiated within the energy band using (3)He detectors. It was determined that optimal spectral fidelity for SNM detection and characterization is achievable using four spectral bands spanning among groups I through 29 (31.8 keV to 17.3 MeV). Using ideal-filter materials to remove the neutrons from different regions of the spectrum, we predicted the maximum neutron spectral resolution obtainable using this approach. To demonstrate our method, we present the optimally detected spectral differences between SNM materials (plutonium and uranium), metal and oxide, using ideal-filter materials. We have also selected a number of candidate filtering materials and, by replacing the ideal filters with real materials, we exemplified our approach with a design of a neutron detector array capable of resolving file spectra from SNM neutron sources using (3)He detectors.

All the samples are aligned with the proton beam axis inside and outside the demountable 92-cm-thick Pb target of 15-cm diameter assembled of 23 4-cm-thick discs. The samples are placed on 12 target disks to reproduce the long axis distribution of protons and neutrons. The target was exposed to an 800-MeV proton beam. The total number of protons onto the target was (6.0 +/- 0.5) x 10(15). The RRs were determined by the direct gamma spectrometry techniques. In total, 1196 gamma spectra have been measured, and about 1500 RRs have been determined. The measured RRs were simulated by the MCNPX and SHIELD codes. A generally acceptable agreement of simulations with experimental data has been found.

While beam losses of 1 W/m are at present accepted for proton machines as a tolerable level for ensuring "hands-on" maintenance, the beam-loss tolerances for high-energy heavy-ion accelerators have not yet been quantified. The Monte Carlo particle transport codes FLUKA and SHIELD were used to simulate the irradiation of copper and stainless steel by different ions (H-1, He-4, C-12, Ne-20, Ar-40, Kr-84, Xe-132, Au-197, and U-238) with energies typical for FAIR machines. Copper and stainless steel were chosen as common materials for accelerator structures. The isotope inventory contributing >90% to the total residual activity does not depend on the projectile species; it depends only on the target material and projectile energy. The activity per watt induced by a 1 GeV/u heavy ion is lower than the activity per watt induced by a 1-GeV proton. A tolerable beam-loss level for a 1 GeV/u U-238 beam wasfound to be similar to 5 W/m.

After irradiation, specific activities and residual dose rates were measured at different cooling times from I h up to several months. Furthermore, the irradiation experiment was simulated with the FLUKA Monte Carlo code. The calculations included a detailed identification of interaction processes creating the different nuclides. First comparisons of experimental data on specific activities and FLUKA results indicate underestimation by FLUKA at irradiation locations laterally to the target, while the agreement seems reasonable downstream of it. The irradiation experiment, the current status of the data analysis, and a preliminary comparison with FLUKA results are presented.	[Bauer, J. M.; Bharadwaj, V.; Brogonia, H.; Kerimbaev, M.; Liu, J.

GENERIC STUDIES OF RADIOACTIVITY INDUCED BY HIGH-ENERGY BEAMS IN DIFFERENT ABSORBER MATERIALS	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Radiation Shielding/15th Topical Meeting of the Radiation-Protection-and-Shielding-Division of American-Nuclear-Society	APR 13-18, 2008	Pine Mt, GA	Amer Nucl Soc, Radiat Protect & Shielding Div		high-energy hadron accelerators; induced radio-activity; residual dose rates		The FLUKA code is used to simulate the residual dose rates around a typical beam absorber considering various scenarios. The latter include carbon, copper, and tungsten as jaw materials, different beam energies, protons, and lead ion beams as well as different irradiation and cooling times. Using the dose rate maximum close to the absorber surface, the study investigates the cooling time dependence for the different scenarios. It is found to be similar for all jaw materials and beam energies. The dose rate scales with energy as E(0.83) and with the number of nucleons when comparing proton beam with lead ions. After a sufficiently long cooling time, a few radio-nuclides produced in the steel tank, such as (56)Co, (58)Co, (48)V, and (54)Mn, dominate the dose rate. The study can be easily extended to other materials or irradiation scenarios and can be applied to first evaluations of given accelerator design options.

The PHITS and the MCNPX codes were used to calculate the proton and neutron fluxes in water-cooled accelerator components. The activation. cross-section sets of oxygen for high-energy protons and neutrons were evaluated from the available experimental data and theoretically calculated data by the INC/GEM and the LAHET codes. The radioactivity from corrosion products was also estimated by scaling of the measurements at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization 12 GeV Proton Synchrotron Experiment (KEK-PS) and Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility (LAMPF). The tritium estimation is an acceptable level for disposal to the environment, while short-lived nuclides at the 3-GeV synchrotron may raise the dose rate in the machine room.

Radionuclide inventories are calculated for an 8-cm-diam, 30.9-cm-long lead target irradiated by 660-MeV protons using the particle transport code MCNPX and the transmutation codes CINDER'90, ORIHET-3, and SP-FISPACT The results using the various codes and data libraries are compared with experimental measurements. Comparisons are also made between the outputs of the three codes for nuclides not represented in the measurements. For more than half the nuclides studied, the codes agree with the measurements within a factor of 2, and nearly all agree within a factor of 10. The present set of codes and nuclear data files are largely adequate for calculating radioactivation in accelerator facilities, but there is room for substantial improvement for selected radionuclides.

The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) organization plans to adopt this code as one of the standard codes for nuclear analyses. However, validation of calculations with this code has not been carried out in detail so far. Thus, we validate this code through analyses of some bulk experiments and streaming experiments with deuterium-tritium neutrons at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency Fusion Neutronics Source. Analyses with the S,, code system DOORS and Monte Carlo code MCNP4C were also carried out for comparison. The agreement between the Attila and DOORS calculations is very good for the bulk experiments. For the streaming experiments Attila requires special treatment (biased angular quadrature sets or last collided source calculation) as well as DOORS in order to obtain similar results as those with MCNP, though Attila consumes much more time than DOORS.

Monte Carlo codes such as FLUKA allow the prediction of the production of individual radioactive isotopes and the induced radioactivity that causes the main contribution to the radiation exposure of personnel. The S work is a benchmark study of activation predictions for uranium beams with 5,90 and 950 MeV/u deposited in copper and stainless steel targets., Precise gamma spectrometry measurement,,: for isotope identification have been carried out with a HPGe detector. All gamma-emitting radionuclides with half-lives of more than 2 days that contribute significantly to the residual dose rates have been studied The benchmark study shows that FLUKA is a suitable code for the prediction of induced radioactivity at medium-energy heavy-ion accelerators.

Gamma radiation that is emitted during these processes as a result of the radioactive decay of reaction by-products [delayed gammas (DGs)] provides unique signatures that are useful for interrogation and information acquisition. Thus, it is of compelling interest to have a simulation tool that can be used to conduct studies to provide insights into the activation and fission processes. Beginning with version 2.5.0, MCNPX has been undergoing major upgrades to facilitate DG simulations. We illustrate the upgrades for a simple multiparticle reaction model involving (60)Ni and for (235)U photofission caused by 12-MeV photons.

The measurements and the interpretation of in vivo measurements performed with the minimum hypothesis about the activity distribution are presented and discussed. Measurements have been performed with a devoted four-germanium-detector system on a male subject presenting a 30-yr-old wound contamination by americium and plutonium isotopes. The measurements have been processed after the construction of voxelized phantoms of the measured body parts and Monte Carlo (MC) calculations of organ- and detector-specific counting efficiencies. The phantom construction and MC calculations were assisted by the OEDIPE software, and the reliability of the modeling has been controlled by a comparison of the measured and simulated efficiencies for point-source measurements and for the measurement of a Spitz anthropomorphic knee phantom. Mainly based on measurements at the knee level, the (241)Am specific bone activity was (0.27 +/- 23%) Bq/g. Using measurements at the thorax level, no activity could be detected in the lungs; the liver activity was between 410 and 460 Bq. The activity of the axillary, thoracic airways and trunk lymph nodes depends on the retained hypothesis, but a reasonable assessment for the axillary lymph nodes is between 100 and 350 Bq.

Gamma line emission can be imported from a library based on the Brookhaven National Laboratory Nuclear Data Center. The user can select one or more isotopes from a tree view list. The abundances can be corrected for radioactive decay, between two times. The line emission is then converted to MCNP SDEF format. Tabulated data, such as an X-ray tube spectrum, can be read and converted to MCNP format. Interactive tools are available for defining source volumes, direction, cone source opening angle, and bias direction; these items can be shown together with the geometry. All source definition items can be entered exactly in dialog fields. Source definitions can be read from existing input files. The tools will expedite and verify source definition and ensure accuracy and do not require knowledge of the MCNP SDEF syntax.

The facility will be utilized for performing basic and applied nuclear research, producing medical isotopes, and training young nuclear specialists. This paper presents the design and analyses of the biological shield performed for the top section of the facility. The neutron source driving the subcritical assembly is generated from the interaction of a 100-kW electron beam with a natural uranium target. The electron energy is in the range of 100 to 200 Me V, and it has a uniform spatial distribution. The shield design and the associated analyses are presented including different parametric studies. In the analyses, a significant effort was dedicated to the accurate prediction of the radiation dose outside the shield boundary as a function of the shield thickness without geometrical approximations or material homogenization. The MCNPX Monte Carlo code was utilized for the transport calculation of electrons, photons, and neutrons. Weight window variance-reduction techniques were introduced, and the dose equivalent outside the shield can be calculated with reasonably good statistics.

For this reason, radiation shielding analyses were performed at Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (FZK) in the course of nuclear safety assessments in support of the GUINEVERE project. The Monte Carlo (MC) MCNP5 model was developed in accordance with the current design of the VENUS-F fast lead reactor. The reactor was assumed to operate on 500-W fission power, which is called zero power, with accelerator-driven system (ADS)-related experimental aims. The MC variance reduction techniques, such as particle splitting, Russian roulette, weight windows, and point detectors, were applied. To speed up the MCNP calculations, the advantages of message-passing interface parallel computations on FZK's CampusGrid Linux Cluster were employed The MCNP track-length estimations, point detectors, and the mesh tally super-imposed over the GUINVERE geometry were used in dose rate calculations. The neutron and photon maps of dose equivalent rate were produced in places of possible personnel access inside the reactor control room and on the accelerator room's floor. To obtain the dose equivalent, the neutron and photon fluences were converted by means of ICRP-77 and ANSI/ANS-6.1.1-1977 conversion factors, respectively. The contributions of the D-D and D-T fusion neutron sources to the dose rate fields were estimated. Activation analyses of the lead core and building materials were performed by the FISPACT-2005 inventory code with the EAF-206 library to manage the radioactive materials after the series of ADS experiments in the GUINEVERE project. The activity density and shutdown contact dose rate have been calculated. The effect of the impurities in lead on its radioactivity after the VENUS-F campaign was examined.

In 2007, the shipment of 16 VPVR/M casks with EK-10 fuel of 10 wt% (235)U, IRT-2M fuel of 80 wt% (235)U, and IRT-2M fuel of 36 wt% (235)U expended at the LVR-15 research facility since 1957 was realized. The VPVR/M cask was designed for all fuel types used in Russian research reactors of similar designs, which were built in man), countries outside of Russia. A revised version of the ORIGEN 2.2 code was used for depletion calculations of 35 types of irradiated fuel. Shielding analyses of the VPVR/M cask were performed using the DORT code with the revised BUGLE-96 multi-group cross-section library based on ENDF/B-VI Release 3. The criticality of the cask loaded with the highest-reactivity fuel was evaluated with the MCNP code using the DLC-200 cross-section data library using the fresh fuel approach. The isotopic inventory of IRT-3M fuel of 36 wt% (235)U burned tip to 184 MWd/kg U was identified as the bounding value. The sources of gamma rays for shielding calculations, neutron sources for shielding and criticality calculations, and heat sources were consequently evaluated. The original design of the cask was optimized with respect to the minimum weight needed for the conservation of the required shielding properties. In compliance with the regulatory requirements for spent-fuel storage and transport casks, the subcriticality of the system met the criticality safety criterion of k(eff) < 0.95 for all the fuel types evaluated. The cask fulfilled Czech safety criteria as well as International Atomic Energy Agency regulations for subcriticality, shielding, heat cooling, and structure requirements.

A proposed solution for this situation is regionalized loading, which involves administratively separating the fuel basket of a shipping cask into two or more regions and loading fuel with different burnup, cooling times, and enrichments into each region. The analysis evaluated how regionalized loading affected spent-fuel shipments. Fuel having a range of burnups and a shipping cask were used in the analysis. The SCALE5 control module SAS2 was used to develop the radiological source terms, and MCNP5 was used to calculate the dose rates associated with the different loading patterns. The analysis indicated that the use of dual-zone loading patterns violated the principles of as-low-as-reasonably-achievable radiation levels. However, the analysis also showed that dual-zone loading patterns reduced the dose rates associated with shipping high-burnup fuel and reduced the time required to ship the fuel. Further analyses were performed to see if a compromise existed.

MTS is a spallation source facility being designed to irradiate reactor fuels and materials in a fast neutron spectrum. Calculated radionuclide inventories are used to provide decay heat input to cooling system design, decay radiation source terms for hot cell design, and material-at-risk input to accident analyses. CINDER'90 is a transmutation code that uses MCNPX-calculated spallation productyields and neurron fluxes to calculate residual nuclide concentrations based on irradiation history. The code also calculates decay heat and photon spectra for the resulting radionuclide inventories. A total activity of 2 X 10(17) Bq is created during MTS operation. Decay heat is an important factor since in loss of primary cooling scenarios, this heat must be removed. The major sources at shutdown are 3000 W for the tungsten target plates and 6000 W for fuel pins being irradiated. Decay photon spectra result in unshielded dose rates that hot cell design must accommodate on the order of 1000 Sv/h. The MTS design includes lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) coolant. For accident analysis (210)Po activity in the LBE is a significant concern. The calculated (210)Po activity following 2.5 yr of operation is 2 X 10(14) Bq. Radionuclide inventory calculations are important for MTS design. The CINDER'90 code is a valuable tool for this purpose.

In the T2K experiment, radionuclides at serious activity levels will be produced in a target, magnetic horns, and partially dissolved into the cooling water. Radionuclides at serious activity levels will also be produced in the cooling water. Therefore, we measured the total activity and distribution of (7)Be, (22)Na, (54)Mn, (57)Co, (60)Co, (88)Y, (101g)Rh, (102m)Rh, and (110m)Ag collected on a demineralizer in the K2K water cooling system, in order to consider reducing both exposure to personnel from the demineralizer and radioactivity released by draining the cooling water at regular intervals in the T2K experiment. The total activity of the individual nuclides was estimated to range from 0.9 MBq to 0.7 GBq at the end of the 2-yr K2K operation. When the results are projected to the T2K experiment, 70 GBq of (7)Be and 6 GBq of (12)Na are particularly high, and shielding from the radiation must be provided for the entire water system. Half of the demineralizer was saturated with the Al, Cu, and Ag ions dissolved from the target and magnetic horns. When the entire column is saturated with the ions, all high activity of (22)Na located at the bottom of the demineralizer will be released into the cooling water immediately. Although (88)Y, (101g)Rh, and (102m)Rh cannot be collected completely because of weak retention by hydrolysis and/or association with colloid, a reduction in the surface area of the Ag metal is possible for new magnetic horns and will result in a decrease of the activities in the cooling water.

Because of this, it is important to understand its radiation release characteristics. In this paper, the Monte Carlo method is applied to evaluate the radiation release characteristics of two types of PWR spent fuel assembly generated from the operating plants in Korea: Westinghouse and Korea Standard Nuclear Power Plant. The source terms were calculated using ORIGEN-ARP. The neutron and photon (or gamma) dose distributions along the vertical and horizontal directions of each spent fuel assembly were evaluated using MCNPX code. Compared with the two dose distributions, the photon dose was found to be about 10(5) times higher than the neutron dose.

J	Beer, HF				Beer, Hans-Frieder			RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT AT THE PAUL SCHERRER INSTITUTE - THE LARGEST SWISS NATIONAL RESEARCH CENTRE	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY & RADIATION PROTECTION			English	Article						waste management; dismantling; conditioning; research reactor; "medicine, industry, and research"		This paper presents the current radioactive waste management practices at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). The PSI contributes to waste related problems in two aspects, namely to the scientific basis of waste management and disposal, and to the practical treatment and storage of radioactive waste. In addition to the tasks of treating on-site generated waste, PSI manages the wastes from medicine, industry, and research throughout Switzerland on behalf of the government. Therefore the Dismantling and Waste Management Section is a part of the Logistics Department at PSI. Proved and accepted methods have to be developed for the safe conditioning and storage of radioactive waste. Various waste treatment facilities exist at PSI. The conditioning facility is dedicated to sorting, compaction by a 120 t press, solidification with special cement, and embedding in concrete. Specialised facilities were constructed for waste from the decommissioning of research reactors. Activated aluminum and its alloys were melted in crucibles and embedded in concrete in a concrete container. After dismantling the structural material of the reactors, it was embedded in concrete in the same manner. For the conditioning of activated reactor graphite, a dedicated method was developed. Graphite was crushed to replace sand in the grout, for embedding radioactive waste in concrete containers. For accelerator waste, a walk-in hot cell equipped with an electrically driven manipulator is available where the highly activated large components (targets, beam dump) can be cut into pieces and embedded in concrete in containers. To guarantee the fulfIlment of the demands of the regulators, the Dismantling and Waste Management Section applies an accredited quality management system for the safe collection, conditioning, and storage of radioactive waste.

HYDROGEOLOGICAL STUDIES FOR RADIOLOGICAL MONITORING OF SHALLOW GROUNDWATER IN THE EUREX PLANT OF SALUGGIA (VERCELLI, ITALY)	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th Workshop on Physical Agents Environmental Monitoring	MAR 24-27, 2009	Vercelli, ITALY					In 2004, contaminated water was found inside the safety interspace around the spent fuel pool; therefore, an ample monitoring programme of the structure, soils and shallow groundwater was started in order to detect any radioactive leakage into the environment. A first group of piezometers was installed. In the one nearest to the pool, an anomalous activity of (90)Sr (similar to 10(-2) Bq l(-1)) was found, calling for the following actions: gradual enlarging of the monitoring network, implementation of in situ permeability tests and groundwater tracer test and study of groundwater mobility of the main radionuclides contained in the pool water: (90)Sr, (137)Cs, (241)Am and (239/240)Pu. Because (90)Sr is the only artificial radionuclide detected in groundwater, this study mainly focused on this one. All the investigations demonstrated that (90)Sr coming from the pool is not detectable any longer just some tens of metres from the building and allow the correlation of (90)Sr concentration to flow and water-table fluctuations. Moreover, such a wide mass of hydrogeological and radiological data allows the estimation of an environmental value for environmental radiological significance.

IMPACT TO PUBLIC AND ENVIRONMENT OF NORM INDUSTRIES IN ITALY	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th Workshop on Physical Agents Environmental Monitoring	MAR 24-27, 2009	Vercelli, ITALY					Italian legislation requires companies undertaking certain work activities involving naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) to check compliance with action levels (1 mSv y(-1) for workers, 0.3 mSv y(-1) for the public). A project is being carried out by ARPAV and other Environmental Agencies to estimate doses to members of the public from NORM from several activities (refractory and tile industry, integrated steelworks, phosphate industry, aluminium production, coal-fired power plants). Activity concentration values of residues have been compared with general clearance levels given in Radiation Protection 122 part 2 and, in several cases, these levels appeared to be exceeded. Doses due to air emissions from stacks, from wastes in disposal sites and from the use of fertilisers in agriculture have been calculated through simulation models (PC-Cream, Resrad, Unscear algorithms), which produce fairly low dose estimates. A major problem for NORM control in Italy at the moment is the lack of official technical and legislative rules (concerning, for instance, residues and effluents management).

DEVELOPMENT OF AN ELECTROLYSIS SYSTEM FOR TRITIUM ENRICHMENT IN SUPERFICIAL WATER SAMPLES	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th Workshop on Physical Agents Environmental Monitoring	MAR 24-27, 2009	Vercelli, ITALY					Tritium present in the environment gradually decreased in the last decades and nowadays it has reached extremely low activity concentrations. The purpose of the present work is the implementation of a tritium enrichment system in water samples using electrolytic techniques and pure nickel and iron electrodes. In the present work a mean tritium enrichment factor of 13.0 +/- 3.2 was obtained. This result should allow to reach a minimum detectable activity of tritium in water samples of about 1 tritium unit (TU) or less. The present enrichment system necessitates further adjustments and improvements, such as a cooling system in order to reduce the tritium losses due to evaporation.

Radioactive radon gas has been recognised by various authors as a valuable natural tracer of transport and dispersion within this layer. To achieve a better comprehension of the urban pollution dynamic in the town of Alessandria, situated in the Po Valley in the north-west of Italy, a system for continuous measurement of radon concentration in outdoor air was experimented. This paper presents the first results obtained: the hourly trend of radon concentration in the diurnal course during different seasons and its correlation with the concentration of the major urban pollutants.

A single-crystal diamond-based thermal neutron beam monitor for instruments at pulsed neutron sources	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Thermal neutrons detectors; Diamond detectors; Pulsed neutron sources		Single-crystal diamond detectors manufactured through a Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) technique are recent technology devices that have been employed in reactor and Tokamak environments in order to detect both thermal and almost monochromatic 14MeV neutrons produced in deuterium-tritium (d-t) nuclear fusion reactions. Their robustness and compactness are the key features that can be exploited for different applications as well. Aim of the present experimental investigation is the assessment of the performance of a diamond detector as a thermal neutron beam monitor at pulsed neutron sources. To this aim, a test measurement was carried out on the Italian Neutron Experimental Station (INES) beam line at the ISIS spallation neutron source (Great Britain). The experiment has shown the capability of these devices to work at a pulsed neutron source for beam monitoring purposes. Other interesting possible applications are also suggested.

The thin-foil magnetic proton recoil neutron spectrometer MPRu at JET	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Neutron; Spectrometer; 14 MeV neutrons; 2.5 MeV neutrons; MPR; MPRu; Fusion; Diagnostic	DT PLASMAS; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; EMISSION; SPECTROSCOPY; CALIBRATION; SPECTRUM; SYSTEM	Neutrons are produced in fusion energy experiments with both deuterium (D) and deuterium-tritium (DT) plasmas. Neutron spectroscopy is a valuable tool in the study of the underlying fuel ion populations. The magnetic proton recoil neutron spectrometer, originally installed at JET in 1996 for 14-MeV neutron measurements, has been upgraded, with the main aim of improving its signal-to-background ratio (S/B), making measurements of the 2.5-MeV neutron emission in D plasmas possible. The upgrade includes a new focal-plane detector, based on the phoswich technique and consequently less sensitive to background, and a new custom-designed digital data acquisition system based on transient recorder cards. Results from JET show that the upgraded MPRu can measure 2.5-MeV neutrons with S/B=5, an improvement by a factor of 50 compared with the original MPR.S/B of 2.8 x 10(4) in future DT experiments is estimated. The performance of the MPRu is exemplified with results from recent D plasma operations at JET, concerning both measurements with Ohmic, ion cyclotron resonance (ICRH) and neutral beam injection (NBI) plasma heating, as well as measurements of tritium burn-up neutrons. The upgraded instrument allows for 2.5-MeV neutron emission and deuterium ion temperature measurements in plasmas with low levels of tritium, a feature necessary for the ITER experiment.

Optimization of geometric parameters for Marinelli beaker to maximize the detection efficiency of an HPGe detector	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Marinelli beaker; Detector efficiency; HPGe; Monte Carlo	RADIOACTIVE HOT PARTICLES; ENVIRONMENTAL-SAMPLES; COUNTING GEOMETRIES; EXTENDED SOURCES; PEAK EFFICIENCY	This paper describes the optimization of the geometric parameters of a Marinelli beaker to maximize the detection efficiency of sample measurement with a High Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector. A Monte Carlo model was developed and the detector pulse spectrum was studied for different beaker geometries with an HPGe detector. The results show that good sample measurement with an HPGe detector can be obtained by appropriate selection of the sample height over the top of the detector cap and the beaker radius surrounding the detector. Optimum sample heights and beaker radii are recommended for different sample volumes for a given detector specification. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

With the new tool DECSERVIS-2 one can simulate radioactive decay chains in open systems, i.e. when the concentrations of nuclides change also due to mass flows. Decay chains can be simulated under continuous and successive nuclide mass flow events into and out from the system and in freely determined time intervals. Simulation output for the entire decay chain (nuclide activity, mass, number of nuclides, nuclide ratios) can be presented as a function of time with various graphical presentations such as solid curve and column diagrams or animation. In this paper we introduce DECSERVIS-2 and demonstrate its use with simulation examples. DECSERVIS-2 is easy to use and has been designed with an eye on the demands of teaching.

The irradiator was based on a 1.3 GBq Pu-238 source, housed in a stainless steel tube flushed with helium. Radiation provided by Pu-238 consists mainly of alpha-particles with energy of 5.5 MeV. The alpha-particle fluence and energy spectra were measured with a silicon semiconductor detector. Monte Carlo simulations were used to estimate the mean number of alpha-particles and the mean absorbed alpha-particle dose to cells for various irradiation times and distances between cells and source. There was a linear dependence between exposure time and alpha-particle fluence for exposure times above 1 s. The alpha-particle activity concentration varied with a factor 2.7 over the source area, while the variation in energy peak position was <4%. At the cell nucleus position and with a distance of 45 mm between the source and the mylar dish surface, the alpha-fluence was 4.6 x 10(4) counts/(mm(2) s), the average incident alpha-particle energy was 2.5 MeV and the average linear energy transfer was 167 keV/mu m. The average dose rate to the cells, with 5 mu m diameter nucleus, was 1.2 Gy/s. The Pu-238 alpha-particle irradiator is feasible for irradiation of cells and it can be used for studies of both direct effects and bystander effects of alpha-radiation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Lee, CY; Lee, TH; Kim, HD				Lee, Chul-Yong; Lee, Tae-hoon; Kim, Ho-dong			A processing circuit for overlapped pulse signals for a thermal neutron coincidence counter	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Overlap pulse; Neutron coincidence counter; Dead-time; OR gate		We have developed a processing circuit for overlapped pulse signals. The overlapped pulse signals are generated when the pulse signals of a He-3 detector, by using a neutron coincidence counter, are connected to shift register coincidence electronics by an OR gate device. The developed circuit detects the overlapped pulse signals from among four input signals and produces new 50 ns pulse wide signals. We considered a case where two pulse signals are simultaneously overlapped among four signals. This circuit was tested with an ACP safeguards neutron counter (ASNC) for an advanced spent fuel conditioning process (ACP) and a (252)Cf neutron source at high rates. The loss rate of the output signal was reduced by 1.27% for singles and 4.75% for doubles when compared with the OR gate device. Also the variation for the triples was much bigger.

Spectral interference corrections for the measurement of U-238 in materials rich in thorium by a high resolution gamma-ray spectrometry	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Uranium (U-238); Thorium (Th-232); gamma-Ray spectrometry; Spectral interference; Self-absorption; True coincidence summing; Correction	URANIUM; SAMPLES; DETECTORS; SEDIMENTS; RA-226; SOILS	In this study, the spectral interferences are investigated for the analytical peaks at 63.3 keV of Th-234 and 1001.0 keV of Pa-234m, which are often used in the measurement of U-238 activity by the gamma-ray spectrometry. The correction methods are suggested to estimate the net peak areas of the gamma-rays overlapping the analytical peaks, due to the contribution of Th-232 that may not be negligible in materials rich in natural thorium. The activity results for the certified reference materials (CRMs) containing U and Th were measured with a well type Ge detector. The self-absorption and true coincidence-summing (TCS) effects were also taken into account in the measurements. It is found that ignoring the contributions of the interference gamma-rays of Th-232 and U-235 to the mixed peak at 63.3 keV of Th-234 (U-238) leads to the remarkably large systematic influence of 0.8-122% in the measured U-238 activity, but in case of ignoring the contribution of Th-232 via the interference gamma-ray at 1000.7 keV of Ac-228 to the mixed peak at 1001 keV of Pa-234m (U-238) results in relatively smaller systematic influence of 0.05-3%, depending on thorium contents in the samples. The present results showed that the necessary correction for the spectral interferences besides self-absorption and TCS effects is also very important to obtain more accurate U-238 activity results. Additionally, if one ignores the contribution of Th-232 to both U-238 and K-40 activities in materials, the maximum systematic influence on the effective radiation dose is estimated to be similar to 6% and similar to 1% via the analytical peaks at 63.3 and 1001 keV for measurement of the U-238 activity, respectively.

Daily variations of indoor air-ion and radon concentrations	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Air-ions; Radon concentration; Exhalation; Indoor air; Gerdien condenser	DECAY PRODUCTS; EXPOSURE; PARTICLES; DWELLINGS; PROGENY; RN-222; MYSORE; THORON	Air-ions and radon are two atmospheric trace constituents which have two opposite effects on human health: the ions are beneficial, and radon gas is potentially lethal as it increases the risk of lung cancer. In the lower troposphere, radon is the most important generator of the air-ions. Ionization by cosmic rays and radioactive minerals is almost constant in daily cycles, and variation of air-ion concentrations is attributed to changes of the radon activity. Air-ion and radon concentrations in outdoor and indoor space and their vertical gradients in residential buildings were measured. Gerdien type air-ion detector "CDI-06" made in our laboratory and radon monitor "RAD7" were utilized for these measurements. Correlation coefficient between positive air-ion and Rn indoor concentrations was approximately 0.7. Outdoor and indoor peak values were simultaneous while vertical gradient of concentrations in indoor measurements was evident. The indoor experiments showed that positive air-ion concentration could be an alternative method of radon activity concentration evaluation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Kolarz, P.

URANIUM DIOXIDE MASS TRANSFER IN THE CENTRAL CHANNEL OF THE FUEL KERNEL OF A FUEL ELEMENT OF A SINGLE-ELEMENT ENERGY-GENERATING CHANNEL	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The methods and computer program for calculating, as well as the computational results obtained, the remaining-life changes occurring in the profile of the central channel of the kernel of a fuel element in a single-element electricity generating channel because of uranium dioxide mass transfer, taking account of the redistribution of the fuel components and the effect of the spacers, are presented. It is shown that the measured and a priori computed profiles of the central channel are close after prolonged testing. It is shown that the superstoichiometric composition of the initial uranium dioxide with oxygen coefficient close to 2.003-2.005 shifts in time to the stoichiometric composition. This is due to the removal of oxygen outside the bounds of the fuel kernel. The calculations show that when uranium dioxide with substoichiometric composition is used or a perforated screen is introduced into the central channel the rate of the axial mass transfer of uranium dioxide is decreased by almost a factor of 2.

STUDY OF A SELF-REGULATED NUCLEAR BURN WAVE REGIME IN A FAST REACTOR BASED ON A THORIUM-URANIUM CYCLE	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article							SUSTAINED REGIME	The possibility of a wave of slow nuclear burning in a fast reactor in thorium-uranium fuel cycle is investigated. The calculations were performed using a model based on the solution of a nonstationary nonlinear diffusion equation for a cylindrical homogeneous reactor using the concept of a radial geometric factor (buckling) and the effective multigroup approximation taking account of the nuclear kinetics of the precursors of delay neutrons and burnup and production of the main nuclides of the thorium-uranium fuel cycle. The calculations showed that the generation and propagation of a wave of nuclear burning traveling with velocity approximately 2 cm/yr are possible in a thorium-uranium medium. However, the addition of even small quantities of a construction material and coolant to the composition of the reactor makes it impossible to obtain the burn wave regime. A self-maintained nuclear burn regime is also established in this case and exists for a long time (similar to 5 yr), but the system does not transition into a regime with a nuclear burn wave propagating along the axis of the reactor.

J	Scissons, KH				Scissons, Kevin H.			Nuclear Safety, Environmental and Community Impacts of Uranium Mining - Canada	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article								The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) is mandated under the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA, The CNSC's mandate is set out in Section 9 of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act.) for regulating all nuclear facilities and nuclear-related activities in Canada. Before any person or company can prepare a site, construct, operate, decommission or abandon a nuclear facility, or possess, use, transport or store nuclear substances, they must obtain a licence issued by the CNSC. This paper provides an overview of the licensing of uranium mines and mills in Canada, taking into consideration the requirements of the NSCA and associated regulations concerning the environment, the people and the communities we protect. Describing the role of the CNSC and our regulatory framework will form a key foundation to this paper. This paper will also explain the different licensing phases and their focus for uranium mines and mills. It will conclude with an overview of our community involvement (social, public aspects) and our joint regulatory approach for defence in depth.

J							ILK	ILK Statement on "Safety Requirements of the Final Storage of Heat-producing radioactive Waste"	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								The German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) has considered it necessary for quite some time to bring up to the current international state of the art the "Safety Criteria for the Final Storage of Radioactive Waste in a Mine" publicized in 1983 in the Federal Gazette by the then competent Federal Ministry of the Interior (BMI). For this purpose, the BMU inter alia commissioned drafts of new safety criteria, requested its two nuclear advisory bodies, the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (RSK) and the Advisory Committee on Radiological Protection (SSK), to elaborate a statement on the last draft available and, on July 29, 2008, published its "Safety Requirements of Final Storage of Heat-producing Radioactive Waste" in a version marked "draft." That draft met with violent criticism among experts, also at the "2008 Repository Symposium" organized by the BMU. Moreover, the safety requirements were not agreed with the German federal states (Lander), but represent conditions imposed by the BMU on the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS). A number of technical points and definitions in the safety requirements were not discussed to the end as far as contents are concerned. In summary, the publication of these requirements does not constitute a basis on which to make progress in the final storage of high-level radioactive waste. The ILK feels that safety requirements to be met in the final storage of high-level radioactive waste are necessary in order for stake-holders and the public to know what yardsticks are applied. These requirements should be based on the best available state of the art in technical and scientific terms and should be adopted jointly by the federal government and the federal states.

J							European Nucl Soc	The medical isotope crisis calls for political action A Position Paper of the High Scientific Council of the European Nuclear Society	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article								Last year saw a major worldwide crisis in the availability of medical radioisotopes. More specifically in the production of Mo-99/Tc-99m generators for diagnostic nuclear medicine. Tc-99m is used in about 80% of all diagnostic nuclear imaging procedures, corresponding to about 30 million examinations yearly worldwide among which several million in Europe alone. The paper shortly analyses the causes of the shortage and points to necessary long-term measures to avoid future crisis. It concludes that for many years to come, the European isotope production will remain fragile, as it is concentrated in only a few facilities, with the associated risk of shortage in case of facility failure. The fragility also comes from economics, since the isotope production is publicly subsidized by the limited number of countries hosting the facilities. This situation calls for a political action, not only to secure the isotope supply, to pool the risks and loads linked to operation, maintenance, radwaste treatment and decommissioning, but also to organize the isotope distribution on a sound and equal economical basis.
