In a no-stirring condition, zinc was easily deposited on a liquid gallium cathode in the form of dendrites. It was difficult for a paddle stirrer to directly fracture the zinc dendrites to fine particles. However, a harrow stirrer was observed to fracture the dendrite to some extent at high speeds. Not only their rotation speed but also the length of their blades needed to be properly adjusted to enhance their performance. In the uranium-cadmium experiment, the diffusion coefficient of the uranium species was obtained by the cyclic voltammetry method, which is around 1 X 10(-5) cm(2)/s. In a no-stirring condition, most of the uranium deposited at the current densities of 35, 100 and 200 mA/cm(2) did not sink into the liquid cadmium cathode. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Structure of mixed U(IV)-An(III) precursors synthesized by co-conversion methods (where An = Pu, Am or Cm)	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							SOLID-SOLUTIONS; OXALATES; CURIUM	Current concepts for future nuclear systems aim at improving the fuel cycle with the main following criteria: economy of resources, minimized volume and lower long-term potential radiotoxicity of ultimate wastes and proliferation risk reduction. Co-management of two (or more) actinides has recently been proposed for recycling reusable energy-producing actinides (mainly U and Pu) together, or for transmuting radiotoxic minor actinides within UO(2)-based materials. Co-conversion processes play an important role by closing the actinide separation-purification operations and at the same time producing mixed actinide solid compounds for the fabrication of fresh fuel. Handling of actinides mixtures, from the initial solution up to the solid product. requires innovative synthesis methods and structures, particularly for the minor actinides such as americium and curium. Considering the different designs of future nuclear fuels, various uranium-actinide co-conversion routes are currently investigated in the CEA-ATALANTE facility. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Development of fuel-model interfaces: Investigations by XPS, TEM, SEM and AFM	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							WASTE-DISPOSAL CONDITIONS; NEAR-FIELD HYDROGEN; SPENT FUEL; LEACHING BEHAVIOR; CORROSION; DISSOLUTION; RADIOLYSIS; ACTINIDES; OXIDATION; WATER	The presented work aims to reproducibly prepare UO(2)-Pd thin film model systems for spent nuclear fuel in order to further investigate surface reactions of these films under relevant redox conditions. The sputter co-deposition of U and Pd (fission product) in the presence of O(2) results in the homogenous distribution of Pd in a crystalline UO(2) matrix. Heating the films causes the diffusion of film components. Hereby, the formation of E-particles has to be clarified. First electrochemical studies show the influence of the nobel metal Pd on the redox behaviour Of UO(2). With increasing Pd concentration the matrix dissolution is decreased. However, we could demonstrate that blocked oxidation processes are of temporary nature. The passivation of the Pd reactive sites with increasing number of cycles finally induces the approximation of the mixed system to the redox behaviour of the pure UO(2) system. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The plutonium/hydrogen reaction: The pressure dependence of reaction initiation time	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							HYDRIDING KINETICS; HYDROGEN; URANIUM; POWDER; ALLOY	The hydrogen pressure dependence of the initiation time (I(t)) of the plutonium hydriding reaction has been determined over a hydrogen pressure range of 10-1000 mbar for plutonium covered in a dioxide over-layer. The data show that hydriding initiation time is inversely proportional to hydrogen pressure. This observation is consistent with a model of hydriding attack in which the dioxide over-layer acts as a diffusion barrier, controlling the flow of hydrogen to the oxide/metal interface. The low scatter and reproducibility of the experimental data set illustrate the importance of synthesising a reproducible oxide layer prior to determining this experimental parameter.

An energy resolution of 10.7% for the 662 keV gamma-line of Cs-137 was measured with the scintillator placed in a light collection setup similar to that used by the CRESST dark matter search. The light output and decay kinetics of ZnWO4 were examined over the temperature range 7-300 K and confirmed to be competitive with those of CaWO4. The radioactive contaminations of the ZnWO4 scintillator measured in the Solotvina Underground Laboratory do not exceed 0.1-10 mBq/kg (depending on radionuclide).

Stand-alone and network capable pocket radiation detection system	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Networked radiation detection; Gamma detection; Neutron detection		A multi-functional and networked pocket radiation detection system has been developed at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) capable of detecting and storing gamma ray and neutron data. The device can be used as a stand-alone device or in conjunction with an array to cover a small or large area. The device has programmable alarm trigger levels that can be modified for specific applications. The data are stored with a date/time stamp and can be transferred and viewed on a PDA via direct connection or, in networked configuration, wireless connection to a remote central facility upon request. Data functional/bench tests have been completed successfully and the device was demonstrated to detect radiation from a 55.6 mu Ci (252)Cf source at 5 m and from 1.4 mCi (252)Cf source at 10 m which exceeds both ANSI and IAEA standards for pocket radiation detection. In terms of sensitivity. this detection system detects neutron and gamma-ray fields down to 10 mu rem/h levels and therefore can find the location of the radioactive source quickly. The detection system is small enough to be put in a pocket or clipped to a belt. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Aryaeinejad, R.; Spencer, D.

A method to modify coordinates of detectors in positron emission tomography systems	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Positron emission tomograph; Spatial resolution; Detector coordinate	NORMALIZATION	A new method to modify coordinates of detectors in any positron emission tomography (PET) system using a radioactive point source is developed. This method is based on selecting a centered detector in each detector block of PET and measuring coincidence counts between the two centered detectors in opposite detector blocks to find the coordinates of their LOR (Line of Response). Due to slight misalignment of detector positions, measured LORs may not intersect at a single point. Based on the proposed method, the coordinates of detectors can be measured with very high accuracy and the coordinate of the center of the gantry (which is normally the same as the center of field of view) can be defined correctly. The results of the application of our method to a small animal PET system (FinePET), which was recently developed at Tohoku University, Japan, are shown here. The method is expected to contribute to the design and development of PET systems which can realize a very high spatial resolution of less than 1 mm FWHM. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A design concept and internal equipments required for the sampling system will be described in detail to provide information for the development of technical requirements for aircraft-mounted sampling equipment. This will be followed by description of the exterior designing process. Difficulties of designing exterior of the sampling system lie in the fluid dynamics performance of the system. The objective of the design is to maximize the suction flow necessary for achieving high efficiency of radionuclide sampling, while minimizing disturbance to the aircraft which carries the system. The design optimization was performed with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code FLUENT. The design options considered here were (1) diameter to head ratio of top and back head, (2) nozzle length and (3) nozzle diameter of the system. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

On the influence of spatial discretization in LWR-burnup calculations with HELIOS 1.9-Part I: Uranium oxide (UOX) fuel	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								Cell and burnup calculations are fundamental for all deterministic static and transient 3D full core calculations for different operational states of the reactor. The spatial discretization used for the cell and burnup calculations influences significantly the results for the used integral transport solutions. The arising differences in the neutron flux distribution are demonstrated of different spatial discretization strategies during the burnup of Uranium oxide (UOX) fuel. These differences in the flux distribution cause significant changes in the isotopic densities and the k(inf) value. The influence of different discretization strategies on the calculation of homogenized few group cross-sections is investigated. The influence of the discretization strategies on the calculation time is evaluated. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Studies on the overall safety aspects during irradiation of TeO2 in the central thimble of the TRIGA research reactor	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							II RESEARCH REACTOR	The purpose of this study is to provide a detailed safety analysis of overall system and components in terms of their ability to provide optimum output from the irradiation of TeO2 in the central thimble of the 3 MW TRIGA MARK II research reactor at Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE), Savar, Dhaka, Bangladesh. It identifies safety issues relevant to I-131 radioisotope production and ensures that safety analysis and design are consistent. It evaluates threats developed within the facility during the irradiation process and ultimately ensures establishment of in-core safety limits and conditions at all stages of I-131 production. In-core irradiation safety not only ensures the safe operation of the reactor but also strengthens the production of radioisotopes (RI). This study attempts to review and modify all safety related events and aspects relating to RI production. The three-dimensional continuous energy Monte Carlo code MCNP is used to develop a versatile and accurate full-core model of the TRIGA core. The cross-section library and fission product inventory are generated by using NJOY and ORIGEN computer codes. The methodology to evaluate heat generation and other relevant parameters necessary to provide enough information for thermal hydraulic analysis are discussed. The neutron flux distribution inside the dry and water filled central thimble is determined in order to locate the highest neutron flux trapping position. The thermal hydraulic and safety analysis are performed by elaborate numerical analysis as well as by using GENGTC computer code. A mock-up facility has also been developed to supplement and verify the theoretically predicted results. The total energy generated during irradiation of 50 gm TeO2 sample in dry condition is found to be 113.84 w of which 75% energy is due to neutron heating and rest of the amount is from gamma heating. Around 11.28 w of heat energy is also generated in the quartz vial. When the total generated-heat transfer is considered through conduction and radiation mechanisms, the calculated temperature of 50 g of TeO2 reaches at 970 degrees C. Considering simultaneous heat transfer mechanisms, (conduction, radiation and convection) the calculated maximum temperature of the 50 g of TeO2 powder comes down at 680 degrees C. it may be pointed out that very high amount of heat is generated during the irradiation of TeO2 at 3 MW reactor power in dry condition which is nearly the melting point of TeO2 and may be termed as unsafe mode of irradiation.

J	Huang, CC; Wu, TY				Huang, Chin-Cheng; Wu, Tung-Yueh			A study on dynamic impact of vertical concrete cask tip-over using explicit finite element analysis procedures	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								This work presents a study on dynamic impact of a vertical concrete cask (VCC) tip-over, using explicit finite element analysis (FEA) procedures. The VCC presented in this paper is made of reinforced concrete casted with a steel liner for accommodating a canister containing spent nuclear fuels. An explicit FEA code, LS-DYNA, is employed to treat the highly nonlinear problems encountered in postulated tip-over events. The plasticity and fragmentation of concrete are respectively treated by the pseudo-tensor material model and the element erosion technique. The interface de-bonding between VCC concrete and steel liner, contact/impact between VCC and target pad are all considered in order to investigate the reasonable impact load for cask design. Four cases with various analysis assumptions are respectively implemented and compared one another for ease of getting design load. The significance of interface de-bonding and concrete fragmentation in VCC to spent fuel cask design is highlighted in the reported numerical results. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Rowlands, J				Rowlands, John			Calculations to compare different ways of modelling the plate geometry cells of the Zebra fast critical assembly, MZA	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								The core region cells of the Zebra fast critical assembly MZA comprise 14 plates in a square steel tube, with 12 cells being stacked axially to form the core section of the assembly. The cells can be modelled in different levels of detail, ranging from a three-dimensional representation in which the core (The word core is used to describe both the region of a plate containing the main material, such as plutonium, UO(2) or sodium, and the region of the assembly containing fissile material cells.) and canning regions of the plates and the void gaps between the edges of the plates and the steel tube, and between tubes, are represented. Simplified models include a three-dimensional representation in which the void regions are combined with the tube material. A further simplified three-dimensional model, called the MURAL model, represents the core regions of the plates but homogenises the canning, tube material and void regions. Two types of one-dimensional slab geometry model are found in the literature, one in which the materials are homogenised within each of the three axial slab regions of a canned plate (plate core and upper and lower canning regions) and a further simplified version in which the plate is modelled as a single region, the compositions being averaged over the whole thickness of the plate, comprising the plate core material, the canning and the tube material. MONK Monte Carlo calculations have been made for each of these models, and also for the fully homogenised cells, and the k-effective values, core sodium void reactivities and reaction rate ratios are compared.

J	Abou-El-Maaty, T; Abdelhady, A				Abou-El-Maaty, Talal; Abdelhady, Amr			Reactor thermal behaviors under kinetics parameters variations in fast reactivity insertion	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							MTR	The influences of variations in some of the kinetics parameters affecting the reactivity insertion are considered in this study, it has been accomplished in order to acquire knowledge about the role that kinetic parameters play in prompt critical transients from the safety point of view. The kinetics parameters variations are limited to the effective delayed neutron fraction (beta(eff)) and the prompt neutron generation time (Lambda). The reactor thermal behaviors under the variations in effective delayed neutron fraction and prompt neutron generation time included, the reactor power, maximum fuel temperature, maximum clad temperature, maximum coolant temperature and the mass flux variations at the hot channel. The analysis is done for a typical swimming pool, plate type research reactor with low enriched uranium. The scram system is disabled during the accidents simulations. Calculations were done using PARET code. As a result of simulations, it is concluded that, the reactor (ETRR2) thermal behavior is considerably more sensitive to the variation in the effective delayed neutron fraction than to the variation in prompt neutron generation time and the fast reactivity insertion in both cases causes a flow expansion and contraction at the hot channel exit. The amplitude of the oscillated flow is a qualitatively increases with the decrease in both beta(eff) and Lambda. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hohlefelder, W				Hohlefelder, Walter			2009 Winter Meeting: Responsibility for Germany's Energy Supply	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Editorial Material								Some 350 stakeholders from the power utilities, industry, politics, administration, science and research met at the 2009 Winter Meeting in Berlin on February 4 and 5, 2009 at the invitation of Deutsches Atomforum for an exchange of ideas and experience. This year's event was organized under the heading of "Responsibility for Germany's Energy Supply." German and foreign experts discussed important aspects of the national and international power supply scenes. Prof. Dr. Hans- Werner Sinn drew attention to counterproductive conflicts caused by the current German renewable energies funding program and by international trade in CO(2) emission credits. Fatih Birol of the International Energy, Agency (IEA) indicated the need for immediate reform of the energy supply system so that renewables, CO(2) sequestration, and nuclear power would be available to help meet the challenges of rising worldwide energy consumption and at the same time, protect the climate. Walter Hohlfelder, President of the Deutsches Atomforum, appealed to German politics to act without bias, realistically and courageously in including nuclear power in the energy mix, also in order to be able to meet the current challenges posed in the financial and economic crisis. The technical and societal aspects of final storage of high-level radioactive waste were the subject of an expert discussion with Holger Broskamp, Michael Sailer, and Prof Dr. Dr. h.c. Ortwin Renn. In an international round of journalists, correspondents from Finland, the United Kingdom, Poland, Switzerland, and the United States analyzed the German energy debate from an external vantage point. Another panel debated whether "responsibility for energy supply" had a chance in Germany.

We are facing enormous challenges: The financial crisis has arrived in the real economy and caused a deep recession. It is also against this background and that of energy prices rising again on a medium term, especially those of oil and natural gas, that the role of nuclear power in keeping prices down is indispensable. This makes life extension of German nuclear power plants an adjunct of a sustainable economic program, all the more so as it will not cost the taxpayer one cent. Climate protection - the operation of nuclear power plants in Germany annually saves emissions of approximately 150 million tons of CO(2) - and security of supply also work in favor of continued operation of these plants. ne important subject of final storage of radioactive waste needs to be pursued consistently. The Konrad mine marks a first step, but results must now be achieved also for high-level waste, for instance, by further exploration of the Gorleben salt dome. An Apollo Program for Energy is also required in designing the future energy mix. This program would include, for instance, research and development of technologies with higher efficiency, new ways to store electricity, technologies Of CO(2) separation and sequestration, and further development of renewable energies as well as fusion technology and advanced generation-IV reactors. Internationally, nuclear power is experiencing another upswing. With the exception of Germany, all other G8 countries, for instance, consider the use of nuclear power an absolutely meaningful enrichment of the energy mix. Definitive plans and applications for construction of new plants, respectively, in countries such as France, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland, and the United States of America underline the importance attached to nuclear power.

J	Drabova, D				Drabova, Dana			Development and Contents of the WENRA Reference levels	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Winter Meeting on Responsibility for Germany's Energy Supply	2009	Berlin, GERMANY					Nuclear safety and radiation protection are based on the principle of the prime responsibility of the operators. The role of national regulators is to ensure that this responsibility is fully secured, in compliance with the regulatory requirements. The regulation of nuclear safety is a national responsibility, and at the same time nuclear safety is an issue of significant international importance. The international aspects of nuclear safety have been the driving force for setting up the Western European Nuclear Regeulators' Association (WENRA), which is a forum for exchanging information and experience with a view to promote continuous improvement of safety and to harmonise safety approach. The WENRA association was officially created in February 1999. Today nuclear safety authorities from 19 countries are members in WENRA. Exchanging experiences and seeking harmonization of safety requirements may help to address the main challenges for nuclear safety regulators. WENRA supports these targets and has created 2 working groups: - the Reactor Harmonization Working Group (RHWG) for nuclear power plants, and - the Working Group on Waste and Dismantling (WGWD) for management of spent fuel and radioactive waste, plus dismantling operations. The results achieved by the 2 Working Groups have confirmed that the adopted working manner towards harmonizing nuclear safety approaches in the European Union is viable, manageable and fruitful.

The Capstone study consisted of two components: 1) generating, sampling, and characterizing DU aerosols fly firing at and perforating combat vehicles, and 2) applying the source-term quantities and characteristics of the aerosols to the evaluation or doses and risks. This paper reviews the background of the study including the bases for the study, previous reviews of DU particles and health assessments, from DU used by the U.S. military, the objectives of the study components, the participants and oversight teams, and the types of exposures it was intended to evaluate. It then discusses exposure scenarios used in the dose and risk assessment and provides an overview of how the field tests and dose and risk assessments were conducted.

AEROSOL SAMPLING SYSTEM FOR COLLECTION OF CAPSTONE DEPLETED URANIUM PARTICLES IN A HIGH-ENERGY ENVIRONMENT	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						uranium, depleted; aerosols; air sampling; monitoring, air		The Capstone Depleted Uranium (DU) Aerosol Study was undertaken to obtain aerosol samples resulting from a large-caliber DU penetrator striking an Abrams or Bradley test vehicle. The sampling strategy was designed to (1) optimize the performance of the samplers and maintain their integrity in the extreme environment created during perforation of an armored vehicle by a DU penetrator, (2) collect aerosols as a function of time post perforation, and (3) obtain size-classified samples for analysis of chemical composition, particle morphology, and solubility in lung fluid. This paper describes the experimental setup and sampling methodologies used to achieve these objectives. Custom-designed arrays of sampling heads were secured to the inside of the target in locations approximating the breathing zones of the crew locations in the test vehicles. Each array was designed to support nine filter cassettes and nine cascade impactors mounted with quick-disconnect fittings. Shielding and sampler placement strategies were used to minimize sampler loss caused by the penetrator impact and the resulting fragments of eroded penetrator and perforated armor. A cyclone train was used to collect larger quantities of DU aerosol for measurement of chemical composition and solubility. A moving filter sample was used to obtain semicontinuous samples for DU concentration determination. Control for the air samplers was provided by live remotely located valve control and pressure monitoring units located inside and around the test vehicle. These units were connected to a computer interface chassis and controlled using a customized LabVIEW engineering computer control program. The aerosol sampling arrays and control systems for the Capstone study provided the needed aerosol samples for physicochemical analysis, and the resultant data were used for risk assessment of exposure to DU aerosol.

CALCULATING CAPSTONE DEPLETED URANIUM AEROSOL CONCENTRATIONS FROM BETA ACTIVITY MEASUREMENTS	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						beta particles; counting efficiency; radioactivity, airborne; uranium, depleted		Beta activity measurements were used as surrogate measurements of uranium mass in aerosol samples collected during the field testing phase of the Capstone Depleted Uranium (DU) Aerosol Study. These aerosol samples generated by the perforation of armored combat vehicles were used to characterize the DU source term for the subsequent Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) of Capstone aerosols. Establishing a calibration curve between beta activity measurements and uranium mass measurements is straightforward if the uranium isotopes are in equilibrium with their immediate short-lived, beta-emitting progeny. For DU samples collected during the Capstone study, it was determined that the equilibrium between the uranium isotopes and their immediate short-lived, beta-emitting progeny had been disrupted when penetrators had perforated target vehicles. Adjustments were made to account for the disrupted equilibrium and for wall losses in the aerosol samplers.

PHYSICOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF CAPSTONE DEPLETED URANIUM AEROSOLS I: URANIUM CONCENTRATION IN AEROSOLS AS A FUNCTION OF TIME AND PARTICLE SIZE	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						aerosols; inhalation; radioactivity, airborne; uranium, depleted		During the Capstone Depleted Uranium (DU) Aerosol Study, aerosols containing DU were produced inside unventilated armored vehicles (i.e., Abrams tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles) by perforation with large-caliber DU penetrators. These aerosols were collected and characterized, and the data were subsequently used to assess human health risks to personnel exposed to DU aerosols. The DU content of each aerosol sample was first quantified by radioanalytical methods, and selected samples, primarily those from the cyclone separator grit chambers, were analyzed radiochemically. Deposition occurred inside the vehicles as particles settled on interior surfaces. Settling rates of uranium from the aerosols were evaluated using filter cassette samples that collected aerosol as total mass over eight sequential time intervals. A moving filter was used to collect aerosol samples over time, particularly within the first minute after a shot. The results demonstrate that the peak uranium concentration in the aerosol occurred in the first 10 s after perforation, and the concentration decreased in the Abrams tank shots to about 50% within 1 min and to less than 2% after 30 min. The initial and maximum uranium concentrations were lower in the Bradley vehicle than those observed in the Abrams tank, and the concentration levels decreased more slowly. Uranium mass concentrations in the aerosols as a function of particle size were evaluated using samples collected in a cyclone sampler, which collected aerosol continuously for 2 h after perforation. The percentages of uranium mass in the cyclone separator stages ranged from 38 to 72% for the Abrams tank with conventional armor. In most cases, it varied with particle size, typically with less uranium associated with the smaller particle sizes. Neither the Abrams tank with DU armor nor the Bradley vehicle results were specifically correlated with particle size and can best be represented by their average uranium mass concentrations of 65 and 24%, respectively.

Aerosol particle size distribution is an important parameter that influences aerosol transport and deposition processes as well as the dosimetry of the inhaled particles. These aerosols were collected on cascade impactor substrates using a pre-established time sequence following the firing event to analyze the uranium concentration and particle size of the aerosols as a function of time. The impactor substrates were analyzed using proportional counting, and the derived uranium content of each served as input to the evaluation of particle size distributions. Activity median aerodynamic diameters (AMADs) of the particle size distributions were evaluated using unimodal and bimodal models. The particle size data from the impactor measurements were quite variable. Most size distributions measured in the test based on activity had bimodal size distributions with a small particle size mode in the range of between 0.2 and 1.2 mu m and a large size mode between 2 and 15 mu m. In general, the evolution of particle size over time showed an overall decrease of average particle size from AMADs of 5 to 10 mu m shortly after perforation to around 1 mu m at the end of the 2-h sampling period. The AMADs generally decreased over time because of settling. Additionally, the median diameter of the larger size mode decreased with time. These results were used to estimate the dosimetry of inhaled DU particles.

PHYSICOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF CAPSTONE DEPLETED URANIUM AEROSOLS III: MORPHOLOGIC AND CHEMICAL OXIDE ANALYSES	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						aerosols; contamination, environmental; uranium, depleted; radioactivity, airborne	OXIDATION-STATES; PARTICLES; KOSOVO; PENETRATORS; TANK	The impact of depleted uranium (DU) penetrators against an armored target causes erosion and fragmentation of the penetrators, the extent of which is dependent on the thickness and material composition of the target. Vigorous oxidation of the DU particles and fragments creates an aerosol of DU oxide particles and DU particle agglomerations combined with target materials. Aerosols from the Capstone DU aerosol study, in which vehicles were perforated by DU penetrators, were evaluated for their oxidation states using x-ray diffraction (XRD), and particle morphologies were examined using scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). The oxidation state of a DU aerosol is important as it offers a clue to its solubility in lung fluids. The XRD analysis showed that the aerosols evaluated were a combination primarily of U3O8 (insoluble) and UO3 (relatively more soluble) phases, though intermediate phases resembling U4O9 and other oxides were prominent in some samples. Analysis of particle residues in the micrometer-size range by SEM/EDS provided microstructural information such as phase composition and distribution, fracture morphology, size distribution, and material homogeneity. Observations from SEM analysis show a wide variability in the shapes of the DU particles. Some of the larger particles were spherical, occasionally with dendritic or lobed surface structures. Others appear to have fractures that perhaps resulted from abrasion and comminution, or shear bands that developed from plastic deformation of the DU material. Amorphous conglomerates containing metals other than uranium were also common, especially with the smallest particle sizes. A few samples seemed to contain small bits of nearly pure uranium metal, which were verified by EDS to have a higher uranium content exceeding that expected for uranium oxides. Results of the XRD and SEM/EDS analyses were used in other studies described in this issue of Health Physics to interpret the results of lung solubility studies and in selecting input parameters for dose assessments.

This static system was employed along with a SUF (synthetic ultrafiltrate) solvent, which is designed to mimic the physiological chemistry of extracellular fluid. Using sequentially obtained solvent samples, the dissolution behavior over a 46-d test period was evaluated by fitting the measurement data to two- or three-component negative exponential functions. These functions were then compared with Type M and S absorption taken from the International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication 66 Human Respiratory Tract Model. The results indicated that there was a substantial variability in solubility of the aerosols, which in part depended on the type of armor being impacted by the DU penetrator and the particle size fraction being tested. Although some trends were suggested, the variability noted leads to uncertainties in predicting the solubility of other DU-based aerosols. Nevertheless, these data provide a useful experimental basis for modeling the intake-dose relationships for inhaled DU aerosols arising from penetrator impact on armored vehicles.

The aerosol was approximated as a mixture of nine monodisperse (single particle size) components corresponding to particle size increments measured by the eight stages plus the backup filter of the cascade impactors used. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian analysis technique was employed, which straightforwardly calculates the uncertainties in doses.

This study consequently produced a database in which the DU aerosol source terms were specified both physically and chemically for a variety of penetrator-impact geometries and conditions. These source terms were used to calculate radiation doses and uranium concentrations for various scenarios as part of the Capstone Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA). This paper describes the scenario-related biokinetics of uranium, and summarizes intakes, chemical concentrations to the organs, and E(50) and HT(50) for organs and tissues based on exposure scenarios for personnel in vehicles at the time of perforation as well as for first responders. For a given exposure scenario (duration time and breathing rates), the range of DU intakes among the target vehicles and shots was not large, about a factor of 10, with the lowest being for a ventilated operational Abrams tank and the highest being for an unventilated Abrams with DU penetrator perforating DU armor. The ranges of committed effective doses were more scenario-dependent than were intakes. For example, the largest range, a factor of 20, was shown for scenario A, a 1 min exposure, whereas, the range was only a factor of two for the first-responder scenario (E). In general, the committed effective doses were found to be in the tens of mSv. The risks ascribed to these doses are discussed separately.

Special thanks is extended to Rick Traub for generating the biokinetic figures used in the text. The authors also want to recognize the contribution of Wes Van Pelt, one of the external panel reviewers, who suggested evaluating doses by individual Cl stages because the activity median aerodynamic diameters poorly characterized many of our aerosol samples. His independent realization of this need helped support Our resolve to proceed with the much more complicated evaluation process using the titanium content of each Cl substrate filter.

The most frequently used guideline for uranium kidney burdens is the International Commission on Radiological Protection value of 3 mu g U g(-1) kidney, a value that is based largely upon chronic studies in animals. In the present effort, a risk model equation was developed to assess potential outcomes of acute uranium exposure. Twenty-seven previously published case studies in which workers were acutely exposed to soluble compounds of uranium (as a result of workplace accidents) were analyzed. Kidney burdens of uranium for these individuals were determined based on uranium in the urine, and correlated with health effects observed over a period of up to 38 years. Based upon the severity of health effects, each individual was assigned a score (- to + + +) and then placed into it Renal Effects Group (REG). A discriminant analysis was used to build it model equation to predict the REG based on the amount of uranium in the kidneys. The model equation was able to predict the REG, with 85% accuracy. The risk model was used to predict the REG for soldiers exposed to depleted uranium as a result of friendly fire incidents during the 1991 Gulf War. This model equation can also be used to predict the REG of new cases in which acute exposures to uranium have occurred.

Although the radiation exposure from DU is low, there is concern that DU deposited in the body may increase cancer rates. Radiation doses to various organs of the body resulting from the inhalation of DU aerosols measured in the Capstone studies were calculated using International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) models. Organs and tissues with the highest calculated committed equivalent 50-y doses were lung and extrathoracic tissues (nose and nasal passages, pharynx, larynx, mouth, and thoracic lymph nodes). Doses to the bone surface and kidney were about 5 to 10% of the doses to the extrathoracic tissues. Organ-specific risks were estimated using ICRP and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) methodologies. Risks for crewmembers and first responders were determined for selected scenarios based on the time interval of exposure and for vehicle and armor type. The lung was the organ with the highest cancer mortality risk, accounting for about 97% of the risks summed from all organs. The highest mean lifetime risk for lung cancer for the scenario with the longest exposure time interval (2 h) was 0.42%. This risk is low compared with the natural or background risk of 7.35%. These risks can be significantly reduced by using an existing ventilation system (if operable) and by reducing personnel time in the vehicle immediately after perforation.

INHALATION AND INGESTION INTAKES WITH ASSOCIATED DOSE ESTIMATES FOR LEVEL II AND LEVEL III PERSONNEL USING CAPSTONE STUDY DATA	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						ingestion; inhalation; radioactivity, airborne; uranium, depleted	HAND EXPOSURE	Depleted uranium (DU) intake rates and subsequent dose rates were estimated for personnel entering armored combat vehicles perforated with DU penetrators (level II and level III personnel) using data generated during the Capstone DU Aerosol Study. Inhalation intake rates and associated dose rates were estimated from cascade impactors worn by sample recovery personnel and from cascade impactors that served as area monitors. Ingestion intake rates and associated dose rates were estimated from cotton gloves worn by sample recovery personnel and from wipe-tests samples from the interior of vehicles perforated with large-caliber DU munitions. The mean DU inhalation intake rate for level II personnel ranged from 0.447 mg h(-1) based on breathing zone monitor data (in and around a perforated vehicle) to 14.5 rug h(-1) based on area monitor data (in a perforated vehicle). The mean DU ingestion intake rate for level II ranged from 4.8 mg h(-1) to 38.9 mg h(-1) based on the wipe-tests data including surface-to-glove transfer factors derived from the Capstone data. Based on glove contamination data, the mean DU ingestion intake rates for level II and level III personnel were 10.6 mg h(-1) and 1.78 mg h(-1), respectively. Effective dose rates and peak kidney uranium concentration rates were calculated based on the intake rates. The peak kidney uranium concentration rate cannot be multiplied by the total exposure duration when multiple intakes occur because uranium will clear from the kidney between the exposures.

APPLICATIONS OF CAPSTONE DEPLETED URANIUM AEROSOL RISK DATA TO MILITARY COMBAT RISK MANAGEMENT	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						aerosols; uranium, depleted; inhalation; risk analysis		Risks to personnel engaged in military operations include not only the threat of enemy firepower but also risks from exposure to other hazards such as radiation. Combatant commanders of the U.S. Army carefully weigh risks of casualties before implementing battlefield actions using an established paradigm that takes these risks into consideration. As a result of the inclusion of depleted uranium (DU) anti-armor ammunition in the conventional (non-nuclear) weapons arsenal, the potential for exposure to DU aerosols and its associated chemical and radiological effects becomes an element of the commanders' risk assessment. The Capstone DU Aerosol Study measured the range of likely DU oxide aerosol concentrations created inside a combat vehicle perforated with a DU munition, and the Capstone Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) estimated the associated doses and calculated risks. This paper focuses on the development of a scientific approach to adapt the risks from DU's non-uniform dose distribution within the body using the current U.S. Department of Defense radiation risk management approach. The approach developed equates the Radiation Exposure Status categories to the estimated radiological risks of DU and makes use of the Capstone-developed Renal Effects Group as a measure of chemical risk from DU intake. Recommendations are provided for modifying Army guidance and policy in order to better encompass the potential risks from DU aerosol inhalation during military operations.

CONCLUSIONS OF THE CAPSTONE DEPLETED URANIUM AEROSOL CHARACTERIZATION AND RISK ASSESSMENT STUDY	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						air sampling; dose assessment; inhalation; uranium, depleted	VETERANS; SURVEILLANCE	The rationale for the Capstone Depleted Uranium (DU) Aerosol Characterization and Risk Assessment Study and its results and applications have been examined in the previous 13 articles of this special issue. This paper summarizes the study's results and discusses its successes and lessons learned. The robust data from the Capstone DU Aerosol Study have provided a sound basis for assessing the inhalation exposure to DU aerosols and the (lose and risk to personnel in combat vehicles at the time or perforation and to those entering immediately after perforation. The Human Health Risk Assessment provided a technically sound process for evaluating chemical and radiological doses and risks from DU aerosol exposure using well-accepted biokinetic and dosimetric models innovatively applied. An independent review of the study process and results is summarized, and recommendations for possible avenues of future study are provided by the authors anti by other major reviews of DU health hazards.

The Minor actinide (MA) ((237)Np, (241)Am, (243)Am and (244)Cm) and long-lived fission product (LLFP) ((99)Tc, (129)I and (135)Cs) nuclides discharged from high burn-up pressured water reactor-mixed oxide spent fuel are considered as the HLW. The volume fractions of the MA and LLFP are raised from 10 to 20% stepped by 2% and 10 to 80% stepped by 5%, respectively. The transmutation analyses have been performed for an operation period (OP) of up to 6 years by 75% plant factor (eta) under a first-wall neutron load (P) of 5 MW/m(2) by using two different computer codes, the XSDRNPM/SCALE4.4a neutron transport code and the MCNP4B Monte Carlo code. The numerical results bring out that the considered FDT has a high neutronic performance for an effective and rapid transmutation of MA and LLFP as well as the energy generation along the OP.

The centrifugal contactor has some attractive advantages such as more compact design and shorter liquid residence times than conventional contactors. Many kinetic studies using a miniature centrifugal contactor have been carried out worldwide. However, there are few engineering-scale studies in which stage efficiencies, transition behavior of concentration profiles, and robustness under maloperation conditions have been comprehensively discussed for a contactor cascade system. In this study, we carried out extraction and stripping tests of an engineering-scale centrifugal contactor cascade system based on a flowsheet of 10 kg-HM/h using uranyl nitrate solution. As a result, the stage efficiencies on uranium extraction and stripping were quite high, nearly 100% for extraction and 97-98% for stripping. The uranium concentration profiles became stable within 10 minutes for both extraction and stripping sections. No overflow or entrainment was observed under normal operation during the extraction and stripping tests. During the stripping test, it was estimated that an increase in temperature of the feed stripping solution from 308 to 333 K or a decrease in the flow rate ratio of the organic to aqueous phase from 1.0 to 0.8 corresponded to the distribution capacity of the two contactors. The maloperation test, in which a motor at a stage of the contactor cascade system was intentionally stopped, showed that the system could maintain stable operation with no emergency shutdown following the installation of at least two additional stages.

The steam-assisted pyrolysis system comprises a decontamination process for the gasification/separation of organic waste from nonvolatile radioactive nuclides by pyrolysis and a destruction process by submerged combustion. This two-step treatment system provides a high-volume reduction of waste and a very small amount of radioactive secondary waste. Tri-n-butyl phosphate/n-dodecane waste contaminated with uranium and simulated halogenated organic wastes stored in Japan Atomic Energy Agency were treated using the steam-assisted pyrolysis system. These wastes were reduced by 98 to 99.4% in weight during the treatment without any trouble using acidic compounds that are produced by the pyrolysis of wastes. Uranium was retained in the gasification chamber and the uranium concentration of secondary waste water was very low, thus permitting the discharge of neutralized waste water to the environment.

The adequacy of the ANCK feedback model was confirmed by analysis of the SPERT-III E-core reactivity accident tests. The chord weighting method was adopted in the effective fuel temperature (Teff) calculation model of ANCK and ANCK/MIDAC since it provides results that are in good agreement with those of a Monte Carlo calculation. The adequacy of the Teff model was also confirmed. The calculation results for hot startup and hot standby conditions using the ANCK code showed excellent agreement for the main parameters such as peak power, peak time, and behavior of reactor power. It was also confirmed that the ANCK feedback model with the chord weighting method was applicable to the reactivity-initiated accident (RIA) calculation for the case of 4.8 wt% UO2 core.

We determined the irradiation time required for oxidation of the dissolved organic carbon. By modifying the experimental apparatus, we decreased contamination by dead carbon, which came mainly from petrochemical products in the apparatus and from the incursion of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The modifications decreased the analytical blank level to less than 1% of sample size, a percentage that had not previously been achieved. The recovery efficiency was high, 95 +/- 1%. To confirm both the accuracy and reproducibility of the method, we tested it by analyzing an oxalic acid radiocarbon reference material and by determining the dissolved organic carbon in surface seawater samples.

The average radon exhalation rates are 20.71 +/- 3.45 mBq.m(-2).s(-1) in the sedimentary areas and 72.51 +/- 62.16 mBq.m(-2).s(-1) in the granite areas except abnormal sites. The observed maximum exhalation rate is 620.76 mBq.m(-2).s(-1) in the Zhuhai area. A small difference in radon exhalation rate was observed in the sedimentary areas, but a large difference was observed in the granite areas. Radon exhalation rate is obviously influenced by moisture content and porosity of soil. It is found that calculated radon exhalation rates are not consistent with measured values. The calculated values are lower than measured ones in the sedimentary areas but no definite correlation between them exists in the granite areas. Different geologic terrains in southern China lead to inherent problems determined by correlating radon exhalation rate with geological setting. Investigation on a larger scale and in greater detail should be conducted for mapping nationwide radon exhalation rate from soil in China.

Herein, the bentonite is characterized by using XRD and FTIR techniques. Sorption of radionickel to MX-80 bentonite in the presence/absence of humic acid (HA) or fulvic acid (FA) as a function of pH is investigated. The results indicate that the presence of HA or FA decreases the sorption of Ni(2+) obviously. The different experimental processes do not affect the sorption of nickel to FA/HA bound bentonite. The sorption of Ni(2+) on FA/HA-bound bentonite decreases with the increasing FA/HA content in the systems. The mechanism of nickel sorption is also discussed in detail.

The U-sorption onto Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Debaryomyces hansenii followed a Langmuir, while that onto Kluyveromyces marxianus and Candida colliculosa a Freundlich isotherm. The results demonstrated that all investigated biomasses could effectively remove uranium from acidic aqueous solutions. From all sorbents, Saccharomyces cerevisiae appeared to be the most effective with a maximum sorption capacity of 127.7 mg U/g dry biomass.

Studies for simultaneous quantitative electrodeposition of plutonium and americium for alpha-spectrometry	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								For high resolution alpha-spectrometric studies, the sources of alpha-emitting actinides are generally prepared by electrodeposition. Usually, by electrodeposition of only one element can be achieved quantitatively. A method was developed for the simultaneous quantitative electrodeposition of plutonium and americium, in two hours using 0.005M oxalic acid with saturated ammonium chloride. The alpha-spectral characteristics of sources prepared by this method were better than those prepared by the drop deposition method. This electrodeposition procedure was validated with nuclear fuel samples containing plutonium and americium.	[Mirashi, N. N.; Aggarwal, S.

For occupational radiation workers urine assay is the preferred method for monitoring of chronic internal exposure. Determination of low concentrations of actinides such as plutonium, americium and uranium at low level of mBq in urine by alpha-spectrometry requires pre-concentration of large volumes of urine. This paper deals with standardization of analytical method for the determination of U-isotopes in urine samples using anion-exchange resin and U-232 tracer for radiochemical recovery. The method involves oxidation of urine followed by co-precipitation of uranium along with calcium phosphate. Separation of U was carried out by Amberlite, IRA-400, anion-exchange resin. U-fraction was electrodeposited and activity estimated using tracer recovery by alpha-spectrometer. Eight routine urine samples of radiation workers were analyzed and consistent radiochemical tracer recovery was obtained in the range of 51% to 67% with a mean and standard deviation of 60% and 5.4%, respectively.

Behavior of uranium and thorium isotopes in soils of the Bor,on area, Mercantour Massif (SE France): Leaching and weathering rate modeling	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							CHERNOBYL ACCIDENT; SERIES DISEQUILIBRIUM; ACTIVITY RATIOS; DRINKING-WATER; RADIONUCLIDES; SEDIMENTS; FALLOUT; RADIOACTIVITY; DEPOSITION; SAMPLES	Four cores were collected in weathered rocks and soils in the Bor,on forest area (1765 m, Mercantour Massif, France). The samples were analyzed for the isotopes (230)Th, (232)Th, (234)U and (238)U. The activity and isotopic ratio profiles suggest that uranium was mobilized (leaching and precipitation) during the weathering process, as well as thorium but in a much less proportion. A model was drawn up to evaluate the U leaching rate and the time that some levels of the weathered rocks have been subjected to weathering. It utilizes LATHAM and SCHWARCZ's two equations,(15) expressed as (234)U/(238)U and (230)Th/(238)U activity ratios, which assume that the alpha recoil effect allows easier leaching for (234)U than (238)U and no Th mobility. But this last assumption does not correspond to the observations made in the Bor,on area, since it appears that in some soil deeper layers (230)Th and (228)Th are in radioactive deficit relatively to their parents. As there are four unknown quantities (the time, the leaching rates of (238)U, (234)U, (230)Th), the problem to be solved requires two more equations; these can be obtained utilizing the U activity ratio in water, and taking into account the (232)Th behavior. In some sites the (238)U leaching rate is high in deeper soil levels (near the fresh rocks); this would correspond to a loss of half the U amount in less than 24 000 years.

The resulting membrane sheets were used to evaluate the removal of surrogate radioactive materials for cesium-137 and strontium-90 from high caustic nuclear waste simulants. The membrane supports met the nominal requirement for non-chemical interaction with the embedded ion-exchange materials and were porous enough to allow sufficient liquid flow. Most of the stamped out 47-mm size titanium impregnated ion-exchange membrane discs removed more than 96% of dissolved cesium-133 and strontium-88 from caustic nuclear waste salt simulants.	[Oji, L.

It was found that in the presence of phosphate sorbed preliminarily on the silica column, the amount of U(VI) sorbed on this column is significantly increased owing to the interaction of U(VI) with phosphate sorbed as compared with that in the absence of phosphate, and the breakthrough and the mean residence time of U(VI) on this column are similar to those in the absence of phosphate. While the effect of simultaneous injection of Cr3+ on the retardation of U(VI) on the silica column, the maximum concentration of BTC and the amount of U(VI) sorbed was found to be insignificant. Transport and sorption studies of U(VI) are important, since all uranium isotopes are radioactive, there is a need to understand the potential for migration away from radioactive waste storage and mill tailing sites.

For each solution and each isotopic ratio, a statistical analysis based on standard ISO 5725 was carried out to calculate the mean, the repeatability and reproducibility standard deviations, the z-score and zeta-score, the bias with respect to the target values, and to compare their precision. The mean measurement results for the (234)U/(238)U and (235)U/(238)U isotopic ratios show no significant biases compared with the target values, whatever is the analytical technique. The results were much less satisfactory for the (236)U/(238)U isotopic ratio, for which only the laboratories specialized in traces analyses and/or precise isotopic analyses submitted results in good agreement with the target values.

In this study, sorption and retardation characteristics of strontium in fine-particle media were studied to evaluate the distribution coefficient (K (d) ) and retardation factor (R (d) ) of this radioactive element in fine-particle media, which was comprised of selected particles with a diameter less than 1 mm from a candidate site to dispose very low level waste (VLLW). The results indicated that K (d) values of strontium under different initial concentrations ranged between 20 and 110. Values of strontium R (d) measured from column experiments ranged between 36 and 102, with the corresponding K (d) values, determined from solving the inverse problem of R (d) calculating formula, ranging between 5 and 20.
