A significant rise of both quantities would enhance the thermal performance and lead to an increased tritium breeding ratio. In order to improve these quantities pretreated lithium orthosilicate pebble material was dry pressed and subsequently sintered. The thermal conductivity of cylindrical pellets was determined by the heat pulse method using a laser flash device. A pebble bed characteristic sample was also investigated in order to check the measurement accuracy in comparison with previous results. Furthermore, two samples of low density cellular ceramics were also prepared by infiltration of polymer foams with a ceramic slurry. The thermal conductivity results show that the values are affected both by the particle size and the sample density. Thermal conductivity values of higher than 2 W/m K were obtained using large particles and sintering at 1000 degrees C. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ion-induced luminescence was measured under irradiation of protons and helium ions in the energy range of 0.2-2 MeV. The luminescent intensity at around 2.9 eV was proportional to the projected range of incident ions, independent of the electronic energy loss. During ion irradiation, the luminescent intensity monotonically decreased with increasing fluence. This decrease could be explained by a simple model that included annihilation and production processes based on nuclear collisions. At room temperature, hydrogen atoms were uniformly distributed in samples with a maximum concentration of 15 at.%. The samples with a higher hydrogen concentration exhibited a lower luminescent intensity: this suggested that hydrogen trapping was related to the luminescent centers in Li2ZrO3.

Design and trial fabrication of a dismantling apparatus for irradiation capsules of solid tritium breeder materials	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Fusion Reactor Materials (ICFRM-13)	DEC 10-14, 2007	Nice, FRANCE				LI2TIO3 PEBBLE BED; BLANKET	Irradiation experiments of solid breeder materials including Li(2)TiO(3) have been being carried out in preparation for a test blanket module (TBM) of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). The present paper deals with design and trial-fabrication works for developing a dismantling apparatus for the irradiation capsules. The dismantling process leads to release of tritium which is left in free volumes of the capsule or in the breeder specimens. In the design of the dismantling apparatus, the released tritium is recovered safely by a purge-gas system during the cutting of the irradiation capsule by a band saw, and then the tritium is consolidated into a radioactive waste. Furthermore, an inner-box enclosing the dismantling apparatus works as a countermeasure of possible release of tritium in accidental events. Good performance of a trial fabrication model of the dismantling apparatus has been demonstrated by preliminary cutting runs using some mockups simulating the irradiation capsules. Thus, the present design of the apparatus, together with the trial mock-up runs, will contribute to the design of the TBM structure and to the planning of the dismantling process of the TBM.

The authors performed out-of-pile annealing tests using the lithium orthosilicate pebbles irradiated in a research reactor. Moreover, the effect of the deposition of palladium in the lithium orthosilicate pebbles on the behavior of tritium release was investigated. The lithium orthosilicate pebbles were irradiated in a research reactor. In the out-of-pile annealing experiments, the temperature of lithium orthosilicate pebbles was raised from ambient temperature to 1173 K at a constant rate of 5 K/min under the stream of 0.1% hydrogen/nitrogen sweep gas. The experimental results indicate that almost all tritium was released as tritiated water vapor from the virgin lithium orthosilicate pebbles. It was also found that a lager amount of tritium was released as the molecular form (HT) from the lithium orthosilicate pebbles deposited with palladium. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Control of molten salt corrosion of fusion structural materials by metallic beryllium	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Fusion Reactor Materials (ICFRM-13)	DEC 10-14, 2007	Nice, FRANCE				ELEVATED-TEMPERATURE; NEUTRON-IRRADIATION; TRITIUM; FLIBE; REDOX; CHEMISTRY; BREEDER; FLUORIDE	A series of tests have been performed between 2001 and 2006 at the Safety and Tritium Applied Research facility of the Idaho National Laboratory to demonstrate chemical compatibility between the molten salt flibe (2LiF + BeF(2) in moles) and fusion structural materials once suitable fluoride potential control methods are established. The tests adopted metallic beryllium contact as main fluoride potential control, and the results have been published in recent years. A further step was to expose two specimens of low activation ferritic/martensitic steel 9Cr-2W to static corrosion tests that include an active corrosion agent (hydrofluoric gas) in controlled conditions at 530 degrees C, and the results of the tests are presented in this paper. The results confirmed the expected correlation of the HF recovery with the concentration of metallic impurities dissolved in the salt because of specimen corrosion. The metals concentration dropped to levels close to the detectable limit when the beryllium rod was inserted and increased once the content of excess beryllium in the system had been consumed by HF reduction and specimen corrosion progressed. Metallographic analysis of the samples after 500 h exposure in reactive conditions showed evidence of the formation of unstable chromium oxide layers on the specimen's surface. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The main purposes of this exercise are the improvement in the uncertainties on the gamma-ray emission intensities and they clarify the discrepancies verified among the intensity values for many weak gamma rays reported in the literature. In this work the results of the activity obtained were used to determine the absolute and relative gamma-ray intensities using a planar and coaxial HPGe detectors calibrated by Eu-152 and 116"'Ho multigamma standard sources covering the energy range from 20 to 1408 keV.

In order to study the details of the detector response and finalize the detector design, a prototype neutrino detector with a scale of 1/3 in diameter is constructed at the Institute of High Energy Physics (1HEP), Beijing. The detector is viewed by 45 8 '' photomultipliers, which are calibrated by LED light pulse. The energy response of the detector, including the resolution, linearity, spatial uniformity, etc., is studied by radioactive sources (133)Ba, (137)Cs, (60)Co, and (22)Na at various locations of the detector. The measurement shows that the detector, particularly the specially designed optical reflectors, works as expected. A Monte Carlo simulation based on the Geant4 package shows a good agreement with the experimental data. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Analysis of spent fuel assemblies using a lead slowing down spectrometer	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Spent fuel measurement; Non-destructive assay	ASSAY	We analyze the potential of using Lead Slowing Down Spectrometer technology for assaying spent fuel. This initial Study demonstrates that it may be feasible to design a system that will provide approximately 1% statistical precision in the determination of the (239)Pu concentration in a pressurized water reactor spent-fuel assembly, for intermediate-to-high burnup levels, using commercial neutron Sources, and an array of ultra-high-purity (238)U threshold fission detectors. LSDS technology can also determine the concentration of (241)Pu and (235)U. There is indication that missing pins can be detected, as can asymmetry in the fuel bundle. The analytical model used to perform the viability assessment is described, as are the systematic effects that were not incorporated in this analysis, but could significantly degrade actual performance. These results provide the justification and impetus for the initiation of followup studies that will incorporate the complete Suite of effects that impact the accuracy of LSDS measurements.

Fissile and fertile nuclear material measurements using a new differential die-away self-interrogation technique	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Spent fuel measurement; Plutonium assay; Differential die-away; Nuclear safeguard; Neutron detector		This paper presents a new technique for the measurement of fissile and fertile nuclear materials in spent fuel and plutonium-laden materials such as mixed oxide (MOX) fuel. The technique, called differential die-away self-interrogation, is similar to traditional differential die-away analysis, but it does not require a pulsed neutron generator or pulsed beam accelerator, and it can measure the fertile mass in addition to the fissile mass. The new method uses the spontaneous fission neutrons from (244)Cm in spent fuel and (240)Pu effective neutrons in MOX as the "pulsed" neutron source, with an average of similar to 2.7 neutrons per pulse. The time-correlated neutrons from the spontaneous fission and the subsequent induced fissions are analyzed as a function of time to determine the spontaneous fission rate, the induced fast-neutron fissions, and the induced thermal-neutron fissions. The fissile mass is determined from the induced thermal-neutron fissions that are produced by reflected thermal neutrons that originated from the spontaneous fission reaction. The sensitivity of the fissile mass measurement is enhanced by the use of two measurements, with and without a cadmium liner between the sample and a hydrogenous moderator that surrounds the sample. The fertile mass is determined from the multiplicity analysis of the neutrons detected soon after the initial triggering neutron is detected. The method obtains good sensitivity by the optimal design of two different neutron die-away regions: a short die-away for the neutron detector region and a longer die-away for the sample interrogation region.

Theory of He trapping, diffusion, and clustering in UO2	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							GENERALIZED GRADIENT APPROXIMATION; TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; WAVE BASIS-SET; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; SINGLE-CRYSTALS; PSEUDOPOTENTIAL APPROACH; DISSOCIATIVE ADSORPTION; HELIUM; BEHAVIOR; TRANSITION	We have performed ab initio total energy calculations to investigate the behavior of helium and its diffusion properties in uranium dioxide MOD. Our investigations are based on the density functional theory within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The trapping behavior of He in UO2 has been modeled with a supercell containing 96-atoms as well as uranium and oxygen vacancy trapping sites. The calculated incorporation energies show that for He a uranium vacancy is more stable than an oxygen vacancy or an octahedral interstitial site (OIS). Interstitial site hopping is found to be the rate-determining mechanism of the He diffusion process and the corresponding migration energy is computed as 2.79 eV at 0 K (with the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) included), and as 2.09 eV by using the thermally expanded lattice parameter of UO2 at 1200 K, which is relatively close to the experimental value of 2.0 eV. The lattice expansion coefficient of He-induced swelling of UO2 is calculated as 9 x 10(-2). For two He atoms, we have found that they form a dumbbell configuration if they are close enough to each other, and that the lattice expansion induced by a dumbbell is larger than by two distant interstitial He atoms. The clustering tendency of He has been studied for small clusters of up to six He atoms. We find that He strongly tends to cluster in the vicinity of an OIS, and that the collective action of the He atoms is sufficient to spontaneously create additional point defects around the He cluster in the UO2 lattice.

J	Rest, J; Hofman, GL; Kim, YS				Rest, J.; Hofman, G. L.; Kim, Yeon Soo			Analysis of intergranular fission-gas bubble-size distributions in irradiated uranium-molybdenum alloy fuel	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							RE-SOLUTION; GROWTH; UO2	An analytical model for the nucleation and growth of intra and intergranular fission-gas bubbles is used to characterize fission-gas bubble development in low-enriched U-Mo alloy fuel irradiated in the advanced test reactor in Idaho as part of the Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactor (RERTR) program. Fuel burnup was limited to less than similar to 7.8 at.% U in order to capture the fuel-swelling stage prior to irradiation-induced recrystallization. The model couples the calculation of the time evolution of the average intergranular bubble radius and number density to the calculation of the intergranular bubble-size distribution based on differential growth rate and sputtering coalescence processes. Recent results on TEM analysis of intragranular bubbles in U-Mo were used to set the irradiation-induced diffusivity and re-solution rate in the bubble-swelling model. Using these values, good agreement was obtained for intergranular bubble distribution compared against measured post-irradiation examination (PIE) data using grain-boundary diffusion enhancement factors of 15-125, depending on the Mo concentration. This range of enhancement factors is consistent with values obtained in the literature. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Rest, J.; Hofman, G.

J	Roth, O; Jonsson, M				Roth, Olivia; Jonsson, Mats			On the impact of reactive solutes on radiation induced oxidative dissolution of UO2	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							SPENT NUCLEAR-FUEL; REPOSITORY CONDITIONS; DISPOSAL CONDITIONS; AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; UNIRRADIATED UO2; RADIOLYSIS; H2O2; CORROSION; KINETICS; NACL	The impact of 2-propanol (100 mM), NaCl (0.1 - 2 M) and Fe(II)(aq) (10 mu M) on the radiation induced oxidative dissolution of UO2 is investigated experimentally by gamma-irradiating a UO2 pellet immersed in aqueous solution containing 10 mM HCO3- together with one of the studied solutes and measure the U(VI) concentration in solution as a function of irradiation time. The solution was saturated with one of the following gases; Air, N2O, inert gas (N-2 or At) in order to vary the experimental conditions and/or avoid the influence of oxygen. The results show that, in the presence of oxygen, 2 M chloride decrease the rate of UO2 dissolution whereas the dissolution rate increases somewhat in the presence of 100 mM 2-propanol. Under oxygen-free conditions both 2 M chloride, 100 mM 2-propanol and 10 mu M Fe(II)(aq) decrease the rate of UO2 dissolution. The trends in dissolution rates were reproduced by calculations based on previously determined rate constants for UO2 oxidation and oxidant concentrations obtained from numerical simulation of radiolysis in the corresponding homogeneous systems (taking reactions between the different solutes and the products of water radiolysis as well as changes in oxygen solubility into account). However, the results indicate that we cannot fully account for the G-values in 2 M chloride solution or all reactions involving CI- in the aqueous phase. This calls for further studies of the chloride system. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Localization by TEM and EELS of deuterium trapping sites in CFC exposed to plasma irradiation in Tore Supra	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							FOCUSED ION-BEAM; AMORPHOUS-CARBON; WALL INTERACTION; COMPOSITES; RETENTION; INVENTORY; SPECTRA; SAMPLES	Carbon fiber composite (CFC) Sepcarb (R) N11 is used in the tokamak Tore Supra as plasma-facing components. To investigate the fuel retention capability of this material, a mobile sample holder was used to expose CFC N11 samples to direct irradiation by the scrape-off layer plasma of Tore Supra at fluences up to 1 x 10(25) m(-2). Deuterium (D) elemental mapping using nuclear reaction analysis for the most-exposed CFC sample showed that D retention occurs at depths greater than 8 Elm due to the presence of deep (>3.5 mu m) local retention sites. In this work, combining transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), we describe at a high spatial resolution where and how D atoms are trapped in these sites. TEM experiments performed on thin cross-sections of the plasma-modified surface show evidence of the presence of a 3.5 mu m-thick deuterated amorphous carbon layer deposited on the CFC surface. We show that specific localized retention sites correspond to the filling of relatively large (similar to 3 mu m.) and deep (at least 3 mu m below the initial CFC surface) cracks between fibres and matrix by the deuterated amorphous carbon layer.

Grazing-incidence electron microscopy of surface blisters in single- and polycrystalline tungsten formed by H+, D+ and He+ irradiation	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							PLASMA-FACING MATERIALS; FLUX DEUTERIUM PLASMA; LOW-ENERGY; ION-IRRADIATION; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; HELIUM IRRADIATION; THERMAL-DESORPTION; CRYSTAL TUNGSTEN; FUSION-REACTORS; RETENTION	Blisters on single- and polycrystalline tungsten surfaces formed by hydrogen and helium ion irradiation were investigated by grazing-incidence electron microscopy (GIEM) with an ultra-high-voltage transmission electron microscope. It was found that the blister skin thickness formed by D+ irradiation of polycrystalline tungsten (PCW) was considerably larger than the calculated ion range of the implants; however, this skin thickness (or blister depth) is not related to the pre-existing grain boundaries in the PCW. Blister formation was also observed with GIEM for single crystal tungsten (SCW) irradiated with H+, D+, and He+. The critical ion fluence for blister formation in SCW is estimated to be similar to 10(23) H+(D+)/m(2) for H(D) and similar to 10(21) He+/m(2) for He. The size of the blisters and their skin structure depends on the irradiating conditions. Typical skin thickness was about 50-150 nm. Based on the assumption that gas particles (H-2, D-2, and He) accumulate within the blisters during H+, D+, and He+ irradiation, the GIEM measurements provide a means to derive an estimate of the amount of gas so accumulated, by reproducing the observed blister shapes with finite element method (FEM) calculations. From the GIEM images and FEM calculations we have estimated the number of implanted ions being retained in the blisters, and compared these amounts with published retention measurements. A mechanism for the blister formation is proposed based on the present results. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Evolution of the nanostructure of VVER-1000 RPV materials under neutron irradiation and post irradiation annealing	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							PRESSURE-VESSEL STEELS; 3-DIMENSIONAL ATOM-PROBE; CR-MO-V; MICROSTRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION; RADIATION EMBRITTLEMENT; APFIM CHARACTERIZATION; POSITRON-ANNIHILATION; WELD; SEGREGATION; PERSPECTIVE	A high nickel VVER-1000 (15Kh2NMFAA) base metal (1.34 wt% Ni, 0.47% Mn, 0.29% Si and 0.05% Cu), and a high nickel (12Kh2N2MAA) weld metal (1.77 wt% Ni, 0.74% Mn, 0.26% Si and 0.07% Cu) have been characterized by atom probe tomography to determine the changes in the microstructure during neutron irradiation to high fluences. The base metal was studied in the unirradiated condition and after neutron irradiation to fluences between 2.4 and 14.9 x 10(23) m(-2) (E > 0.5 MeV), and the weld metal was studied in the unirradiated condition and after neutron irradiation to fluences between 2.4 and 11.5 x 10(23) m(-2) (E > 0.5 MeV). High number densities of similar to 2-nm-diameter Ni-, Si- and Mn-enriched nanoclusters were found in the neutron irradiated base and weld metals. No significant copper enrichment was associated with these nanoclusters and no copper-enriched precipitates were observed. The number densities of these nanoclusters correlate with the shifts in the Delta T(41) (J) ductile-to-brittle transition temperature. These nanoclusters were present after a post irradiation anneal of 2 h at 450 degrees C, but had dissolved into the matrix after 24 h at 450 degrees C. Phosphorus, nickel, silicon and to a lesser extent manganese were found to be segregated to the dislocations. Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Miller, M. K.; Russell, K. F.; Nanstad, R.

Amorphization of the interaction products in U-Mo/Al dispersion fuel during irradiation	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							POSTIRRADIATION EXAMINATION; REACTION LAYER; MO; URANIUM; REACTORS; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEM; U3SI2	The microstructures of the product resulting from interaction between U-Mo fuel particles and the Al matrix in U-Mo/Al dispersion fuel are discussed. We analyzed the available characterization results for the Al matrix dispersion fuels from both the out-of-pile and in-pile tests and examined the difference between these results. The morphology of pores that form in the interaction products during irradiation is similar to the porosity previously observed in irradiation-induced amorphized uranium compounds. The available diffraction studies for the interaction products formed in both the out-of-pile and in-pile tests are analyzed. We have concluded that the interaction products in the U-Mo/Al dispersion fuel are formed as an amorphous state or become amorphous during irradiation, depending on the irradiation conditions.

LEU foil plate target proposed by University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) will be irradiated in PARR-1 for the production of 100Ci of Molybdenum-99 at the end of irradiation, which will be sufficient to prepare required (99)Mo/(99m)Tc generators at Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology, Islamabad (PINSTECH) and its supply in the country. Neutronic and thermal hydraulic analysis for the fission Molybdenum-99 production at PARR-1 has been performed. Power levels in target foil plates and their corresponding irradiation time durations were initially determined by neutronic analysis to have the required neutron fluence. Finally, the thermal hydraulic analysis has been carried out for the proposed design of the target holder using LEU foil plates for fission Molybdenum-99 production at PARR-1. Data shows that LEU foil plate targets can be safely irradiated in PARR-1 for production of desired amount of fission Molybdenum-99. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We have developed a fast-valve system and complementary 3-D Monte-Carlo code which can be used separately or in combination to assess the effusive-flow properties of vapor-transport systems, independent of size, geometry and chemical properties of the transport species. In this report, we describe the fast valve and present time spectra and characteristic time data for noble gases flowing through serial- and parallel-coupled vapor-transport systems similar in geometry but longer than those used for RIB generation at the HRIBF with and without target coating matrices.

The program was designed to provide a basis for validation of criticality calculations for MOX fuel manufacturing processes and particularly those with low-moderated MOX fissile material. An extensive experimental program was performed, including criticality and reactor-type parameter measurements. The experiments were evaluated, peer reviewed, and analyzed with various codes and cross-section data. The criticality validation study was performed employing a sensitivity/uncertainty technique based on the generalized linear least squares method.

In the first part, the study deals with the analyses of spent fuels through the isotopic content of actinides (U, Pu, Np, Am, Cm), fission products used to evaluate the burn-up (Nd, Cs) and the most absorbing fission products (Sm, Eu, Gd). The interpretation performed with the APOLLO2.8 code package shows that the concentrations of the main fissile isotopes -(235)u, Pu-239 and (241)pU - are predicted to better than 8% on the overall height of the fissile column, with an experimental uncertainty below 5% (1 sigma). For the second part, reactivity worth measurements of irradiated UOx fuels were performed in the MINERVE facility using an oscillation technique. The analysis shows a very good agreement between the calculated and the experimental values of reactivity loss for the three samples, with different void fraction and burn-up. The Calculation - Experiment biases (C/E - 1) are lower than +1.8%, with an uncertainty of 2.8% (1 sigma). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Monte Carlo study of photoneutron production in U-235 following perturbations in cross section data	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Physics of Reactors - Nuclear Power, A Sustainable Resource	SEP 14-19, 2008-2009	Interlaken, SWITZERLAND				TRANSPORT; NEUTRON	Active photon interrogation systems may be employed to detect high-Z isotopes without significant spontaneous fission emissions. These systems induce photonuclear reactions with emissions (such as fission neutrons) that may be detected. However, there are inconsistencies in the literature reporting resonance photonuclear interaction data for many isotopes. Recent publications show variations as large as 20% between various measurements of photonuclear cross section data. A perturbation methodology utilizing the modular nature of the MCNPX/MCNP-PoliMi code system has been implemented and is applied here to highly-enriched uranium. Monoenergetic photon sources between 8 and 18 MeV were simulated; neutron detection was performed using the MCNP-PoliMi liquid scintillator model. At photon energies less than 12 MeV, the number of detected neutrons is approximately 70% sensitive to changes in the (gamma,f) cross section and 30% sensitive to changes in the (gamma, n) cross section. As gamma-ray energy increases the (gamma,f) sensitivity increases and the (gamma, n) sensitivity decreases. There is a small (gamma,2n) sensitivity at photon energies between 15 and 17 MeV. The ability of modern simulation tools to predict photonuclear responses is greatly limited in this energy region due to the high sensitivity of the simulated results to observed discrepancies in photonuclear cross section data.

Economy of uranium resources in a three-component reactor fleet with mixed thorium/uranium fuel cycles	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Physics of Reactors - Nuclear Power, A Sustainable Resource	SEP 14-19, 2008-2009	Interlaken, SWITZERLAND					The potential for minimizing uranium consumption by using a reactor fleet with three different components and mixed thorium/uranium cycles has been investigated with a view to making nuclear power a more sustainable and cleaner means of generating energy. Mass flows of fissile material have been calculated from burnup simulations at the core-equivalent assembly level for each of the three components of the proposed reactor fleet: plutonium extracted from the spent fuel of a standard pressurized water reactor (first component) is converted to (233)U in an advanced boiling water reactor (second component) to feed a deficit of multi-recycled (233)U needed for the Th/(233)U fuel of the light/heavy water reactor (third component) which has a high breeding ratio. Although the proposed fleet cannot breed its own fuel, we show that it offers the possibility for substantial economy of uranium resources without the need to resort to innovative (and costly) reactor designs. A very high fleet breeding ratio is achieved by using only currently existing water-based reactor technology and we show that such three-component systems will become economically competitive if the uranium price becomes sufficiently high (>300 $/kg). Another major advantage of such systems is a corresponding substantial decrease in production of plutonium and minor actinide waste. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Wilson, J.

It can be conveniently produced by a small-sized cyclotron via the (86)Sr(p,n)(86)Y nuclear reaction. The optimization of the electrochemical separation of (86)Y from the target material and its purification was done by modeling the whole production cycle using (90)Y. The radionuclide was isolated using four electrodes in two electrolytic steps. In the first step two Pt plate anodes and a Pt Winkler cathode were used and the electro-deposition yield was determined in constant current mode of operation. In addition, the influence of pH on the efficiency of this first step was investigated. The second electrolysis, with Winkler electrode as anode and a Pt wire as cathode, was also performed in constant current mode of operation. The kinetics of recovery of the deposited activity on the Pt wire was investigated in acidic solutions. The optimized electrochemical method was then applied for (86)Y separation and purification. This modified procedure was proved to be faster and simpler than the previously proposed electrochemical techniques and is more convenient for automation of the routine production of (86)Y.

Cyclotron and linac production of Ac-225	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th Pacific Basin Nuclear Conference	OCT 15-20, 2006	Sydney, AUSTRALIA			Actinium; Ac-225; Ra-226; Bl-213; Linac; Cyclotron and NMC		Radium needles that were once implanted into tumours as a cancer treatment are now obsolete and constitute a radioactive waste problem, as their half-life is 1600 years. The reduction of radium by photonuclear transmutation by bombarding Ra-226 with high-energy photons from a medical linear accelerator (linac) has been investigated. A linac dose of 2800 Gy produced about 2.4 MBq (64 mu Ci) of Ra-225, which decays to Ac-225 and can then be used for Targeted Alpha Therapy(TAT) of cancer. This result, while consistent with theoretical calculations, is far too low to be of practical use unless much larger quantities of radium are irradiated, The increasing application of Ac-225 for cancer therapy indicates the potential need for its increased production and availability. This paper investigates the possibility of producing of Ac-225 in commercial quantities, which could potentially reduce obsolete radioactive material and displace the need for expensive importation of Ac-225 from the USA and Russia in the years ahead. Scaled up production of Ac-225 could theoretically be achieved by the use of a high current cyclotron or linac. Production specifications are determined for a linac in terms of current, pulse length and frequency, as well as an examination of other factors such as radiation issues and radionuclei separation. Yields are compared with those calculated for the Australian National Cyclotron in Sydney. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For imaging in vivo not only is the radioactivity in the target organ important, but so too is the ratio of radioactivity in the target versus that in the background. Nearly all studies reported in the literature have dealt with the surface index, as a standard factor to study the relationship between the target (tissue or organ) and the background. It is necessary to know the ratio between the volumetric activity of lesions (targets) and normal tissues (background) instead of knowing the ratio between the area activity, the volume index being a more realistic factor than the area index as the targets (tissues or organs) are real volumes that have surfaces. The intention is that this work should aid in approaching a quantitative relationship and differentiation between different tissues (target/background or abnormal/normal tissues). For the background, square regions of interest (Rios) (11 x 11 pixels in size) were manually drawn by the observer at locations far from the border of the plastic cylinder (simulated organ), while an isocontour region with 50% threshold was drawn automatically over the cylinder. The total number of counts and pixels in each of these regions was calculated. The relationship between different phantom parameters, cylinder (target) depth, area activity ratio (background/target, A(B/T)) and real volumetric activity ratio (background/target, V(B/T)), was demonstrated. Variations in the area and volumetric activity ratio values with respect to the depth were deduced. To find a realistic value of the ratio, calibration charts have been constructed that relate the area and real volumetric ratios as a function of depth of the tissues and organs. Our experiments show that the cross-sectional area of the cylinder (applying a threshold 50% isocontour) has a weak dependence on the activity concentrations of the background. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Distribution of naturally occurring radionuclides activity concentration in East Malaysian marine sediment	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						NORM; East Malaysia; Marine sediment; External hazards value		Studies of naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) distribution of (226)Ra (228)Ra and (40)K in East Malaysia were carried out as part of a marine coastal environment project. The results of measurements will serve as baseline data and background reference level for Malaysia coastlines. Sediments from 21 coastal locations and 10 near shore locations were collected for analyses. The samples were dried, finely ground, sealed in a container and stored for a minimum of 30 days to establish secular equilibrium between (226)Ra and (228)Ra and their respective radioactive progenies. They were counted using a high-purity germanium (HPGe) spectrometer covering the respective progeny energy peak. For 40K, the presence of this was measured directly via its 1460 keV energy peak. The concentration of (226)Ra, (228)Ra and 40K in samples obtained from coastal Sarawak ranged between 23 and 41 (mean 30 +/- 2) Bq/kg, 27 and 45 (mean 39 +/- 4)Bq/kg and 142 and 680 (mean 462 +/- 59)Bq/kg, respectively. Meanwhile, the concentration of (226)Ra, (228)Ra and (40)K for samples obtained from coastal Sabah ranged between 16 and 30 (mean 23 +/- 2)Bq/kg, 23 and 45 (mean 35 +/- 4)Bq/kg and 402 and 842 (mean 577 +/- 75)Bq/kg, respectively. For the Sarawak near shore stations, the concentration of (226)Ra, (228)Ra and (40)K ranged between 11 and 36 (mean 22 +/- 2)Bq/kg, 21 and 65 (mean 39 +/- 5)Bq/kg and 149 and 517 (mean 309 +/- 41)Bq/kg, respectively. Meanwhile, the concentration of (226)Ra, (228)Ra and (40)K for samples obtained from Sabah ranged between 9 and 31 (mean 14 +/- 2)Bq/kg, 10 and 48 (mean 21 +/- 3)Bq/kg and 140 and 580(mean 269 +/- 36)Bq/kg, respectively. The calculated external hazard values of between 0.17 and 0.33 (less than unity) showed that there is little risk of external hazard to the workers handling the sediments. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The mean activity concentrations of (238)U, (232)Th and (40)K were 65.26 +/- 12.99, 23.66 +/- 0.95 and 146.33 +/- 1.50 Bq kg(-1), respectively. Data of the soil samples show evidence of possible deposition and accumulation of (137)Cs. The mean activity concentration of (137)CS in the soil samples was 4.37 +/- 0.16 Bq kg(-1) with a range of 0,00-35.70 Bq kg(-1). The measured activity concentration range of (137)CS was compared with reported ranges in the literature from some of the other locations in the world. The radium-equivalent, dose rate in air and annual effective dose rate were evaluated. The mean activity concentrations of the gamma-ray emissions from radionuclides in El-Qattamia petrified wood forest region were relatively low. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Relationship between radioactivity of radium and concentrations of barium and lead in hokutolite	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Hokutolite; Radium; Gamma-ray spectrometry; Photon activation analysis; Medical accelerators	TAIWAN	Hokutolite consists of barite (BaSO(4)) and anglesite (PbSO(4)), and contains significant amounts of radium isotopes as a radioactive mineral. Photon activation and gamma-ray spectrometry were employed to determine Ba, Pb and (226)Ra contents in hokutolite samples and to investigate the correlation between (226)Ra activity and both Ba and Pb content. (226)Ra activity in 30 hokutolite samples were estimated in the range of 40-65 Bq/g and was positively related to Ba content (r = 0.859, p < 0.001), but independent of Pb content (r = -0.236, p = 0.217). Experimental results implied that (226)Ra preferably precipitated with Ba over Pb. The (226)Ra activity in hokutolite from the Peitou Hot Spring was experimentally estimated based on the Ba/Pb ratio and expressed as (226)GRa (Bq/g) = 14.67 (Ba/Pb)(molar)+14.13.

Uranium statistical and geological evaluation of airborne spectrometric data in the Al-Awabed region and its surroundings (Area-3), Northern Palmyrides, Syria	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Uranium prospecting; Aerial spectrometry survey; Al-Awabed region; Northern Palmyrides; Syria	PHOSPHATIC DEPOSITS; SIGNATURES	Qualitative and quantitative statistical analysis have been applied to the Airborne spectrometric data from the Al-Awabed region and its surroundings (Area-3), Northern Palmyrides, Syria. It was shown that equivalent uranium eU values vary between a minimum of 0.01 and a maximum of 22.33 ppm. The probability graph has been used to compute the threshold level of uranium in the study area. It was found that this threshold level of 5.54 ppm agrees well with that obtained by traditional statistical computation ((X) over bar + 2 sigma). Uranium prospecting methodology is proposed in order to explain the origin of the radioactive anomalies related to the Al-Awabed region and its surroundings in Area-3, and to determine the dominant geological conditions that effectively contribute to the radioactive anomalies occurring in the study area. Four radioactive-geological profiles have been established in Area-3, where their analysis and study reveal that lowlands and basins, the unconformity between Paleogene and Neogene, the contact between Cretaceous and Paleogene and the phosphate beds themselves are considered favorable environments for uranium deposits. The proposed methodology is proven and field verified and can be therefore applied in other areas considered as promising for uranium deposits. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The electromotive force of a solid-electrolyte galvanic cell and solid-phase coulonometric titration were used to establish the regularities of the variation of the oxygen potential versus the oxygen/metal ratio for the oxide U(0.718)Ce(0.282)O(2-x) . A thermodynamic model of uranium dioxide with elements dissolved in the matrix was developed; the model makes it possible to determine the oxygen potential in a wide interval of temperatures and non-stoichiometry.

J	Renn, O				Renn, Ortwin			Can the Repository Problem in Germany Be Solved by Societal Consensus?	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								The final storage of radioactive waste is an issue mobilizing people. It is intimately connected with the whole debate about the future of nuclear power. Another concept associated with this topic is risk, which also incorporates the three basic elements of complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity. If the repository problem in Germany is to be advanced, questions must be answered about the complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity of the risk involved, and the answers must be taken into account in the process of implementation. Complexity: Experts must seek to achieve consensus in knowledge of the criteria describing the suitability of a repository. Uncertainty: Discourses must be led to weigh the pros and cons in finding a stable solution for a "sufficiently good" site under the prevailing conditions. Ambiguity: An overarching, fundamental discourse must be led about the way people in Germany design their future, i.e. above and beyond the mere question of power supply. The siting decision requires agreement, on scientific and technical grounds, about the suitability of site concepts and the criteria applying to a suitable site. In addition, there must be an equitable compensation for the acceptance of uncertainties. The objective is finding a just and stable solution so as to be able to manage uncertainties in a prospective way. This also involves site development as a respected and honored acceptance by society of uncertain consequences and possible future burdens.

J	Klein, F				Klein, Frank			Conditioning of Fuel Plates from Siemens Training Reactors - Process Development and Application	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								Siemens training reactors (SUR) were installed in the Federal Republic of Germany in the 1960s and 1970s. The SUR line I I were so-called 0-power reactors (thermal power: 100 MW) operated on uranium oxide enriched <20%. The SUR core was made LIP of fuel plates, i.e. polyethylene plates in which the uranium oxide was dispersed. Disassembly and demolition of the SUR reactors was begun after several decades of operation. However, no disposal pathway existed for the fuel plates, as the material could not be emplaced in the Konrad repository. Against this background, the Radiochemistry Chair of the Munich Technical University, (RCM) in 2003 launched a research and development (R&D) project funded by the Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF). The purpose of the exercise was to recover the uranium oxide from the fuel plates and blend it to an enrichment level of <4.9%. The blend produced in this way was to be recycled into the production of LWR fuel elements for German nuclear reactors. The project was completed in 2007. The conditioning process developed was employed to treat and recycle four SUR cores. The article describes the development of the conditioning technique. Some preliminary studies indicated a development pathway which was then pursued further tip to the definition of the final technical setup. Setbacks and partial successes are described, technical and analytical solutions explained. A defined quality product was generated from the four SUR cores which met all specification requirements.

DESIGN OF THE NIF CRYOGENIC TARGET SYSTEM	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	18th Target Fabrication Specialists Meeting	MAY 11-15, 2008	Lake Tahoe, CA			NIF; cryogenic target system; ignition		The U.S. Department of Energy has embarked on a campaign to conduct credible fusion ignition experiments on the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 2010. The target assembly specified for this campaign requires the formation of a deuterium-tritium fuel ice layer in a 2-mm-diam capsule at the center of a 9-mm-long X 5-mm-diam cylinder, called a hohlraum. The ice layer must be formed and maintained at temperatures below 20 K. At laser shot time, the target is positioned at the center of the NIF target chamber, aligned to the laser beams, and held stable to <7-mu m root-mean-square. We have completed the final design of the cryogenic target system and are currently integrating the devices necessary to create, characterize, and position the cryogenic target for ignition experiments.

OPTICAL AND X-RAY CHARACTERIZATION OF GROOVE PROFILES IN D-T ICE LAYERS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	18th Target Fabrication Specialists Meeting	MAY 11-15, 2008	Lake Tahoe, CA			cryogenic ice; phase contrast; grain boundary groove	OBJECTS; SIZE	Deuterium-tritium (D-T) single-crystal ice layers in spherical shells often form with localized defects that we believe are vapor-etched grain boundary grooves built from dislocations and accommodating slight misorientations between contacting lattice regions. Ignition implosion target requirements limit the cross-sectional areas and total lengths of these grooves, and since they are often the dominant factor in determining layer surface quality, it is important that we be able to characterize their depths, widths, and lengths. We present a variety of ray-tracing and diffraction image modeling results that support our understanding of the profiles of the grooves, which is grounded in X-ray and optical imaging data. We also describe why these data are nevertheless insufficient to adequately determine whether or not a particular layer meets the groove requirements for ignition. We present accumulated data showing the distribution of groove depths, widths, and lengths from a number of layers, and we discuss how these data motivate the adoption of layer rejection criteria in order to ensure that layers that pass these criteria will almost certainly meet the groove requirements. We also describe future improvements that will provide more quantitative information about grooves in D-T ice layers.	[Koch, J. A.; Kozioziemski, B. J.; Salmonson, J.; Chernov, A.; Atherton, L.

DEVELOPMENT OF A LASER-PRODUCED PLASMA X-RAY SOURCE FOR PHASE-CONTRAST RADIOGRAPHY OF D-T ICE LAYERS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	18th Target Fabrication Specialists Meeting	MAY 11-15, 2008	Lake Tahoe, CA			inertial confinement fusion; cryo layering; X-ray phase contrast imaging	IGNITION	Refraction-enhanced X-ray phase-contrast imaging is crucial for characterization of deuterium-tritium (D-T) ice layer roughness in optically opaque inertial confinement-fusion capsules. Observation of the time development of D-T ice roughness over approximately second timescales requires a bright X-ray source that can produce an image faster than the evolution of the ice surface roughness. A laser-produced plasma X-ray source is one of the candidates that can meet this requirement. Experiments were performed at the Janus laser facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to assess the characteristics of a laser-produced plasma X-ray source as a potential backlight for in situ target characterization.

BENCHMARKING X-RAY PHASE CONTRAST IMAGING FOR ICF D-T ICE CHARACTERIZATION USING ROUGHENED SURROGATES	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	18th Target Fabrication Specialists Meeting	MAY 11-15, 2008	Lake Tahoe, CA			cryogenic deuterium-tritium layered capsules; X-ray phase contrast radiography; atomic force microscopy	CAPSULES	We use X-ray phase contrast imaging to characterize the inner surface roughness of deuterium-tritium (D-T) ice layers in capsules for future ignition experiments. It is therefore important to quantify how well the X-ray data correlate with the actual ice roughness. We benchmarked the accuracy of our system using surrogates with fabricated roughness characterized with high precision standard techniques. Cylindrical surrogates with azimuthally uniform sinusoidal perturbations with 100-mu m period and 1-mu m amplitude demonstrated 0.02-mu m accuracy limited by the resolution of the imager and the source size of our phase contrast system. Spherical surrogates with random roughness close to that required for the D-T ice for a successful ignition experiment were used to correlate the actual surface roughness to that obtained from the X-ray measurements. We compare first the average power spectra of individual measurements. The accuracy mode number limits of the X-ray phase contrast system benchmarked against surface characterization performed by atomic force microscopy are 60 and 90 for surrogates smoother and rougher than the required roughness for the ice. These agreement mode number limits are about 100 when comparing matching individual measurements. We will discuss the implications for interpreting D-T ice roughness data derived from phase contrast X-ray imaging.

To better understand how to produce and control the required uniform fuel ice layer, experimental layering targets are fabricated and assembled to be dimensionally similar to the ignition targets and vacuum leaktight at 18 K. Low,production yield of these targets demanded a more quantitative understanding of the interfacial behavior of bonded joints and required the development of more deterministic assembly methods. Each sealing joint was individually analyzed, and target components, assembly processes, and tooling were modified as needed to make robust leaktight targets.

THE ASSEMBLY AND CHARACTERIZATION OF DYNAMIC HOHLRAUM DOUBLE-SHELL TARGETS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	18th Target Fabrication Specialists Meeting	MAY 11-15, 2008	Lake Tahoe, CA			double-shell; target; fabrication	GLASS SHELLS; FABRICATION; LASER	General Atomics has supported the dynamic hohlraum experiment series with the production of double-shell targets filled with deuterium, xenon, and neopentane gases. Production of a double-shell target is a process by which multiple subassemblies are fabricated, assembled, and characterized in a planned sequence. An inner capsule assembly is produced with a SiGDP conversion glass capsule stalk mounted and attached together with glass fill tube and laser-cut beryllium disk. An outer CH mandrel with a permeation barrier is then machined and each subassembly fitted together. Challenges include aligning the inner and outer glass capsules as well as filling the inner void space with known gas quantities. Information describing how we assemble the target, new hardware designed to complete the gas fills, and characterization techniques to analyze the assembly will be presented.	[Vermillion, B.

LASER FORMING OF SHAPED FILL HOLES IN BERYLLIUM TARGETS FOR INERTIAL CONFINEMENT FUSION EXPERIMENTS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	18th Target Fabrication Specialists Meeting	MAY 11-15, 2008	Lake Tahoe, CA			laser; microfabrication; drilling		A variety of shaped fill holes is needed in beryllium capsules for inertial confinement fusion experiments to allow for pyrolysis of the plastic (CH) mandrels, deuterium (D(2)) or deuterium-tritium gas fill, and fill tube attachments. The holes required include through-holes ranging in diameters from similar to 5 to 30 mu m and counter-bores ranging in diameters from similar to 13 to 17 mu m with depths <37 mu m. These holes are laser drilled using a double-pulse nanosecond format. Hole diameter and depth can be controlled by altering pulse format, energy, anal beam delivery optics. Furthermore, according to National Ignition Campaign specifications, there is a tight tolerance for perturbations on capsule surfaces, so we have developed a technique to eliminate material redeposition through the use of sacrificial foils stretched over the targeted areas.
