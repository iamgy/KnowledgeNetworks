Sequential determination of Po-210 and uranium radioisotopes in drinking water by alpha-particle spectrometry	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Radionuclide Metrology-Low-Level Radioactivity Measurement Techniques	SEP 22-26, 2008	Braunschweig, GERMANY			Polonium; Uranium; Alpha-particle spectrometry; Radiochemistry; Drinking water		Procedures for the sequential determination of low level Po-210 and uranium radioisotopes in drinking water by alpha-particle spectrometry are presented. After addition of Po-208 and U-232 tracers, the radionuclides were preconcentrated from water samples by co-precipitation on Fe(OH)(3) or MnO2 at pH 9 using ammonia solution. The Po-210 source was prepared by spontaneous deposition onto a copper disc either before or after uranium separation. The uranium source for alpha-particle counting was prepared by micro co-precipitation with CeF3. The procedures were tested on mineral water and the results obtained are compared.

In-vitro analysis of the dissolution kinetics and systemic availability of plutonium ingested in the form of 'hot' particles from the Semipalatinsk NTS	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Radionuclide Metrology-Low-Level Radioactivity Measurement Techniques	SEP 22-26, 2008	Braunschweig, GERMANY					In-vitro leaching of radioactive 'hot' particles isolated from soils sampled at the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site has been carried out in order to evaluate the fraction of plutonium activity released into Simulated human stomach and small intestine fluids during digestion. Characterisation of the particles (10-100 Bq (239.240)Pu) and investigation of their dissolution kinetics in simulated fluids has been accomplished using a combination of high-resolution alpha-spectrometry, gamma-spectrometry and liquid scintillation counting. The results of these analyses indicate that plutonium transfer across the human gut following the ingestion of 'hot' particles can be up to two orders of magnitude lower than that expected for plutonium in a more soluble form, and show that for areas affected by local fallout, use of published ingestion dose coefficients, together with bulk radionuclide concentrations in soil, may lead to a considerable overestimation of systemic uptake via the ingestion pathway.

Since dismantling was a complex task, to achieve the main goal was minimization of radioactive waste production and required the set-up of procedures, criteria of free release, strict follow-up and traceability at all steps. This study gave an overview of the efforts on non-destructive assay (NDA) of relatively large volumes of waste and the sampling of contaminated waste with radiochemical analysis was utilized to determine the radionuclide vectors. The experiences of free release planning and measurement of a very low level radioactivity with high throughput for scrapped metal at the INER and the technical achievements in this research could offer a reference of decision-making by the competent authority.

The present work studies the effect that salts present in sea water have in the gross alpha/beta determination using low-level liquid scintillation counting and a new method is established. This is done from a previously established method for such determinations in non-saline water. External quenching parameter, efficiency, spectra position and interference values are evaluated to look for differences in matrix behaviour. Some quality parameters of the new method are reported.

Model of nanotube formation in solution under molecular sorption conditions	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article							SIMULATION	Reliable disposal of radioactive wastes in nanosize containers which ensure that the wastes are isolated and strongly contained is investigated. A model of the process of incorporating impurity components into solutions where nanotubes are formed is presented to substantiate the possibility considered. An attempt is made to describe the rolling up of nanotubes in a liquid medium from the standpoint of the energy balance in a system that consists of a nanometer-size thin film and molecules which are sorbed on its surface from solution. The results show that when molecules are sorbed from solution onto a nanolayer surface the layer rolls up. The possibility that a roll or nanotube loses stability when sorbed molecules are present in them must be taken into account when studying the final state of the nanolayer.	[Poluektov, P.

Spectrometric method of evaluating spent nuclear fuel characteristics	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								A spectrometric method of identifying spent fuel assemblies according to the type of fuel elements present in them is described. The method is based on the results of spectrometric measurements and subsequent analysis of the radiation from fission products and the characteristic radiation from uranium in the irradiated fuel. The fuel assemblies used in the VVR-2 and OR research reactors contained fuel elements of a different type, differing by the initial quantity of uranium contained in them. To prepare the spent fuel assemblies for shipment to a reprocessing facility after long-time storage in cool-down pools, the assemblies must be sorted according to the type of fuel elements present in them. The method developed for identifying the types of fuel elements in the irradiated fuel is based on the dependence of the intensity of the characteristic radiation from uranium on the uranium content in a fuel element. The degree of excitation of the characteristic radiation of uranium also depends on the intensity of the radiation from fission products, which is monitored during the spectrometric measurements performed on the irradiated fuel; ultimately, this makes it possible to sort the spent fuel assemblies.

J	Vance, R				Vance, Robert			Uranium Supply/Demand Projections to 2030 in the OECD/NEA-IAEA "Red Book"	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Vertiefungskurs 2008 Kembrennstoffe - Wirtschaftlichkeit und Versorgungssicherheit	NOV 20-21, 2008	Olten, SWITZERLAND					World demand for electricity is expected to continue to grow rapidly over the next several decades to meet the needs of an increasing population and economic growth. The recognition by many governments that nuclear power can produce competitively priced, base load electricity that is essentially free of greenhouse gas emissions, combined with the role that nuclear can play in enhancing security of energy supplies, has increased the prospects for growth in nuclear generating capacity. Since the mid-1960s, with the co-operation of their member countries and states, the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have jointly prepared periodic updates (currently every 2 years) on world uranium resources, production and demand. These updates have been published by the OECD/NEA in what is commonly known as the "Red Book". The 2007 edition replaces the 2005 edition and reflects information current as of 1(st) January 2007. Uranium 2007: Resources, Production and Demand presents, in addition to updated resource figures, the results of a recent review of world uranium market fundamentals and provides a statistical profile of the world uranium industry. It contains official data provided by 40 countries (and one Country Report prepared by the IAEA Secretariat) on uranium exploration, resources, production and reactor-related requirements. Projections of nuclear generating capacity and reactor-related uranium requirements to 2030 as well as a discussion of long-term uranium supply and demand issues are also presented.

J	Printz, R; Valencia, L; Merx, H				Printz, Rudolf; Valencia, Luis; Merx, Heike			Research Locations Preparing for Commissioning of the Konrad Repository	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								After the Federal Republic of Germany had been given a relatively free hand on May 5, 1955 in the sector of peaceful nuclear power research and application, the German national research centers were established, among other developments. In addition, a number of other institutions were founded, especially those attached to universities, which were active in fundamental nuclear research, such as the Munich Technical University (TUM), which commissioned the first German research reactor (FRM-1, the so-called Atomic Egg) for this purpose in Garching as early as in October 1957. Operation of the nuclear research and pilot facilities under government responsibility gave rise to radioactive waste and residues which had to be disposed of in a planned and regulated approach. For this purpose, facilities for treatment, conditioning and interim storage were set up at various locations, especially in Karlsruhe and Julich. These facilities have been used to this day in the management of the waste and residues arising from decommissioning and demolition of nuclear plants. After a legally valid, executable license had been granted in 2007 to the repository for solid or solidified radioactive waste producing negligible amounts of heat, i.e. the former Konrad mine, corresponding boundary conditions were created for managing the respective radioactive waste. Emplacement is expected to begin in 2013 at the earliest. The 2 research centers of Karlsruhe and Julich are cited as models to show how government-operated waste producers prepare for the boundary conditions and what measures are being initiated, respectively, in order to be able to emplace in the Konrad repository the radioactive waste existing or to arise in the future.

SUBMICRON GOLD COATING MEASUREMENTS FOR HOHLRAUM DEVELOPMENT	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	18th Target Fabrication Specialists Meeting	MAY 11-15, 2008	Lake Tahoe, CA			X-ray fluorescence; thickness measurement; hohlraum development		A thin gold layer is deposited as a liner on the interior of a uranium hohlraum to protect from oxidation of uranium. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry was chosen as the liner thickness measurement method for its accuracy, speed, and ease of measurement. The process is noncontact and nondestructive. The thicknesses were determined using a micro-XRF spectrometer unit with analysis software. The accuracy of the measurements was verified against qualified standards. The method was used to accurately measure gold liner thicknesses of cylindrical hohlraums, and it gave initial promising results for measuring the thickness of a boron-doped gold layer when corrected for the gold atom fraction.

THICKNESS, DOPING ACCURACY, AND ROUGHNESS CONTROL IN GRADED GERMANIUM DOPED CHX MICROSHELLS FOR LMJ	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	18th Target Fabrication Specialists Meeting	MAY 11-15, 2008	Lake Tahoe, CA			quartz microbalance; laser target; amorphous hydrogenated carbon	CHEMICAL-VAPOR-DEPOSITION; CONFINEMENT FUSION EXPERIMENTS; C-H FILMS; DEPOLYMERIZABLE MANDREL; FABRICATION; TARGET; SPECIFICATIONS; COATINGS	In the Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique Laser Megajoule (LMJ) facility, amorphous hydrogenated carbon (a-C:H or CHX) is the nominal ablator used to achieve inertial confinement fusion experiments. These targets are filled with of fusible mixture of deuterium-tritium in order to perforin ignition. The a-C:H shell is deposited on a poly-alphamethylstyrene (PAMS) mandrel by; glow discharge polymerization with trans-2-butene, hydrogen, and helium. Graded germanium doped CHX microshells are supposed to be more stable regarding hydrodynamic instabilities. The shells art, composed of four layers for a total thickness of 180 mu m. The germanium gradient is obtained by doping the different a-C:H layers with the addition of tetramethylgermanium in the gas mixture. As the achievement of ignition greatly depends on the physical properties of the shell, the thicknesses, doping concentration, and roughness must be precisely controlled. Quartz microbalances were used to perform an in situ and real-time measurement of the thickness in order to reduce the variations-and so our fabrication tolerances-on each layer thickness. Ex situ control of the thickness of each layer was carried out, with both optical coherent tomography and interferometry, (wallmapper). High-quality, PAMS and a rolling system have been used to lower the low-mode roughness [root-mean-square (rms) (mode 2) < 70 nm]. High modes were clearly, reduced by, coating the pan containing the shells with polyvinyl alcohol + CHX instead of polystyrene + CHX resulting in an rms (>mode 10) < 20 nm, which can be <15 nm for the best microshells. The germanium concentration (0.4 and 0.75 at.%) in the a-CH layer is obtained by regulating the tetramethylgermanium flow. Low range mass flow controllers have been used to improve the doping accuracy.

PROPERTIES OF SILICON-DOPED GDP SHELLS USED FOR CRYOGENIC IMPLOSIONS AT OMEGA	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	18th Target Fabrication Specialists Meeting	MAY 11-15, 2008	Lake Tahoe, CA			cryotargets; Si-doped polymer; FTIR analysis	ICF TARGETS; POLYMER SHELLS; FABRICATION	One suggested approach to decreasing preheat of Laboratory for Laser Energetics cryotargets is to add a silicon dopant similar to 4 to 6 at.% to normal plasma polymer. As in the case of pure CH and CD shells used previously, the physical properties of these shells are of utmost importance to allow proper fielding for cryogenic shots. We have fabricated and characterized two types of Si-doped glow discharge polymer (GDP) capsules: single-layer Si-doped GDP shells (SiGDP) and double-layer Si-doped GDP/SCD shells (SiGDP/SCD). The Si-doped GDP shells with an similar to 870-mu m diameter and 5-mu m-thick walls were fabricated to meet the cryogenic direct laser fusion experiment requirements. Si-doped GDP shells with <0.25-mu m wall variation and 5% silicon dopant level were delivered. These cryogenic shells can survive a 1000-atm D(2) or deuterium-tritium fill and cryogenic cooling without bursting or buckling. With an average buckle strength of 70 psi, a half-life of 12 s, and a D(2) permeability at 20 degrees C of 2.4 X 10(-14) (mol X m/m(2) X Pa X s), Si-doped GDP shells meet the criteria for cryogenic experiments. A possible drawback of the SiGDP layer is its rapid OH pickup due to exposure to air, which an increase the amount of infrared light absorbed in the shell wall as compared to D(2) ice and possibly result in a poor ice uniformity during the cryogenic layering process. The absorption coefficient of the SiGDP at 3160 cm measured by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is similar to 48 cm(-1) at 0.1 h to similar to 130 cm(-1) at 167 h of air exposure.	[Luo, R.

China is the world's largest producer and consumer of cigarettes, yet no comprehensive published reports of the Pb-210 and Po-210 activity concentrations in Chinese cigarettes are available. Twelve brands of cigarettes that were commonly smoked within a group of 184 Chinese smokers were selected for Ph-210 and Po-210 activity analysis. For each brand, the tobacco from two cigarettes was isolated, dried, weighed, spiked with a (209)po tracer for yield, and digested with concentrated HNO3, followed by HCl. The polonium in each digested solution was spontaneously deposited onto a nickel disc. The polonium activity was then counted rising alpha spectroscopy. The mean (range) Po-210 activity for all brands was 23 (18-29) mBq cig(-1). The state of radioactive equilibrium between (210)To and Pb-210 in each cigarette was verified in three brands of cigarettes. Cigarettes from two brands were smoked on a machine in order to estimate the fraction of Pb-210 and Po-210 inhaled. An average of 8% of the Pb-210 and 13% of the Po-210 in the tobacco of the cigarettes was transferred to the mainstream smoke. It is thus estimated that a person smoking 20 of these cigarettes per day in China would inhale a mean (range) of 37 (29-46) mBq d(-1) of Pb-210 and 60 (47-75) mBq d(-1) of Po-210. Cigarette smoking in China may therefore be a large source of a person's daily intake of Pb-210 and Po-210.

URANIUM IN DRINKING WATER: EFFECTS ON MOUSE OOCYTE QUALITY	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						biological indicators; chromosome aberration; pregnancy; uranium	INTRACYTOPLASMIC SPERM INJECTION; DEPLETED URANIUM; URANYL-NITRATE; DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY; CHEMICAL TOXICITY; MALE REPRODUCTION; NATURAL URANIUM; MICE; EMBRYOS; EXPOSURE	The aim of this work was to evaluate the reproductive toxicological effects of uranium (U) at 2.5, 5, and 10 mgU/kg/d chronically administered in drinking water for 40 d. Swiss female control mice (n = 28) and mice chronically contaminated with uranyl nitrate in drinking water (n = 36) were tested. The number and quality of ovulated oocytes, chromatin organization, and nuclear integrity were evaluated. No significant differences were obtained in the numbers of ovulated oocytes between the different groups. Nevertheless, in 1,520 of the oocytes examined, dysmorphism increased from 11.99% in the control group to 27.99%, 27.19%, and 27.43% in each of the contaminated groups, respectively, in a dose-independent manner. On the other hand, morphological chromatin organization from 880 oocytes examined showed an increase in metaphase plate abnormalities from 37.20% (+/- 7.21) in the control group to 55.13% (+/- 21.36), 58.29% (+/- 21.72), and 64.10% (+/- 12.62) in each of the contaminated groups, respectively. Cumulus cell (CC) micronucleation, a parameter of nuclear integrity, increased from 0.21% (+/- 0.31) in the control group to 1.92 (+/- 0.95), 2.98 (+/- 0.97), and 3.2 (+/- 0.98), respectively. Both metaphase plate abnormalities and CC micronucleation showed an increase in a dose-dependent manner (r = 0.9; p < 0.001). The oocyte and its microenvironment showed high sensitivity to uranium contamination by drinking water. The lowest observed adverse effect level for this system is estimated at a level below 2.5 mgU/kg/d for female mice.

This paper presents a method of calibrating a clearance box monitor based on practical experimental measurements and Monte Carlo simulations. Adjusting the simulation for experimental data obtained using a simple point source permits the computation of absolute calibration factors for more complex geometries with an accuracy of a bit more than 20%. The uncertainty of the calibration factor can be improved to about 10% when the simulation is used relatively, in direct comparison with a measurement performed in the same geometry but with another nuclide. The simulation can also be used to validate the experimental calibration procedure when the sample is supposed to be homogeneous but the calibration factor is derived from a plate phantom. For more realistic geometries, like a small gravel dumpster, Monte Carlo simulation shows that the calibration factor obtained with a larger homogeneous phantom is correct within about 20%, if sample density is taken as the influencing parameter. Finally, simulation can be used to estimate the effect of a contamination hotspot. The research supporting this paper shows that activity could be largely underestimated in the event of a centrally-located hotspot and overestimated for a peripherally-located hotspot if the sample is assumed to be homogeneously contaminated. This demonstrates the usefulness of being able to complement experimental methods with Monte Carlo simulations in order to estimate calibration factors that cannot be directly measured because of a lack of available material or specific geometries.

It was designed to test the Canadian Federal, Provincial and Municipal response to a terrorist attack using radioactive materials. The complexity or this exercise had been increased over previous exercises to now include provincial and municipal players. As a result about 350 persons participated as players in the 4-day exercise that was held in two locations in the western part of Canada. This paper summarizes the experiences and the lessons learned of the Health Canada HQ team.

Also, medical personnel in hospitals lack a basic understanding of radiation principles, as well as diagnostic and treatment guidelines for radiation exposure. Clinicians have indicated that they lack sufficient training on radiological emergency preparedness; they are potentially unwilling to treat patients if those patients are perceived to be radiologically contaminated; and they have major concerns about public panic and overloading of clinical systems. fit response to these findings, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed a tool kit for use by hospital medical personnel who may be called on to respond to unintentional or intentional mass-casually radiological and nuclear events. This tool kit includes clinician fact. sheets, a clinician pocket guide, a digital video disc (DVD) of just-in-time basic skills training, a CD-ROM training on mass-casualty management, and a satellite broadcast dealing with medical management or radiological events.

J	Nakano, Y; Okubo, T; Koma, Y				Nakano, Yoshihiro; Okubo, Tsutomu; Koma, Yoshikazu			Effect of Decontamination Factor on Core Neutronic Design of Light Water Reactors Using Recovered Uranium Reprocessed by Advanced Aqueous Method	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						recovered uranium; re-enrichment; advanced aqueous reprocessing; decontamination factor; U-236; U-235 enrichment; moderator temperature reactivity coefficient		In the case where uranium recovered by an advanced aqueous reprocessing is utilized in light water reactors (LWRs) with the thermal neutron spectrum, the effects of the decontamination factor (DF) of the reprocessing on core neutronic characteristics were examined. The amounts of transuranium (TRU) elements and fission products (FPs) contained in the recovered uranium depend on the DF of reprocessing, and also U-236 is generated by neutron capture of U-235 during a reactor operation. These all act as poisons in the fuel. Therefore, in this paper, the additional U-235 enrichment necessary to compensate for the produced TRU elements, FPS, and U-236 was evaluated for three representative DF values: 10(2), 10(3), and infinity. The low value of 10(2) corresponds to the advanced aqueous reprocessing investigated here. An APWR core with a discharge burnup of 49 GWd/t when the initial U-235 enrichment is 4.6% was considered as the reference core. Uranium of the reference core was enriched from the natural one. It was calculated that the recovered uranium has to be re-enriched up to 5.24% even when DF is infinity in order to achieve the same burnup, of 49 GWd/t as the reference core. On the other hand, it was also found that the necessary U-235 enrichment after the advanced aqueous reprocessing studied here with the low DF value of 10(2) is only slightly different. The effect of the DF value on moderator reactivity coefficient was also studied, and no effect was found.

The heat generation rates in the canister containing these wastes were obtained using burn-up calculations of PWR fuels. For wastes from spent MOX fuel, the heat generation rates increase to 3.2-4.5 times that from present-day burn-up spent UO2 fuel when these canisters are disposed of. The temperature distributions in the area around the disposal galleries for these wastes were obtained using two-dimensional thermal analyses by assuming a maximum 80 degrees C temperature exposure of the cement mortar. For wastes from spent MOX fuel, the temperature of the surrounding rock remains at about 60-70 degrees C after disposal, even after 1,000 years. In this case, the number of canisters loaded in a waste package must be decreased from four to around one. This increases the number of waste packages to contain the required number of canisters. It will be important to apply alternative approaches to increase the amount of wastes in a waste package by reducing the amounts of FPs and actinides adhering to hulls and to optimize the layout design of galleries, which may be done by significantly increasing the distance separating neighboring galleries.

J	Overcamp, TJ				Overcamp, Thomas J.			Energy Absorption Buildup Factors and Energy Conservation	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						buildup; gamma radiation; energy conservation; energy absorption		The ANSI/ANS energy absorption buildup factors (ANSI/ANS-6.4.3-1991) were used to determine if they conserve absorbed energy from a point source of monoenergetic photons in an infinite, absorbing medium. Air, water, concrete, iron, lead, and uranium were considered for photon energies ranging from 0.015 to 15 MeV. The primary calculations were based on fitting natural cubic splines to the energy absorption buildup factors and analytical integration of the energy absorbed using the cubic spline curve fit. This method was supplemented by linear spline interpolation. For air, water, concrete, and iron, the ANSI/ANS energy absorption buildup factors were determined using the method of moments with the energy attenuation and deposition coefficients of Hubbell (NSRDS-NBS 29). The results of this Study essentially confirmed energy conservation for these four materials using the energy attenuation and deposition coefficients of Hubbell. For lead and uranium, the ANSI/ANS energy absorption buildup factors were determined using the discrete ordinates-integral transport method with PHOTX energy attenuation and deposition coefficients that are essentially the same as those in the ANSI/ANS report. The calculations in this study could not confirm energy conservation for these two materials.

Burnup calculations of the BR3 MOX fuel were performed using a general-purpose neutronic calculation code SRAC, and core calculations of the three critical cores were carried out using SRAC, a transport calculation code THREEDANT, and a continuous-energy Monte Carlo code MVP. The measured inventories of major U and Pu isotopes on a sample taken from the BR3 MOX fuel agree with the results of the burnup calculations within 3% deviation. The k(eff)'s of the three cores are from 0.985 to 1.002. The measured burnup reactivity of the irradiated BR3 MOX fuel was well reproduced by the three types of core calculations. The influence of the accuracy of the inventory calculations on burnup reactivity was studied by comparing between the calculated and measured inventories. The result indicates that the biases in the inventory and reactivity calculations compensate each other, and it makes the total biases of the burnup reactivity small.

This course has had nuclear and radiation engineering and chemistry graduate students. While the course also has an extensive laboratory component only the lectures are web based. The lectures begin with a historical introduction of radiochemistry followed by two movies on Madame Curie. This is followed by the usual lectures on radioactivity, fundamental properties, radioactive decay, decay modes, and nuclear reactions. As section on radioactive waste management and nuclear fuel cycle is also presented. Lectures in neutron activation analysis, geo- and cosmochemistry, and plutonium chemistry have also been developed. All lectures are in power point with many animations and a significant number of solved problems. All students are required to make a short oral presentation on some aspect of nuclear and radiochemistry in their research or a chosen topic.

Radionuclidic standardization by primary methods: An overview	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd International Nuclear Chemistry Congress (2nd-INCC)	APR 13-17, 2008	Cancun, MEXICO				METROLOGY; SYSTEM; RADON; NEEDS; NI-63; NBS	Primary methods of radionuclidic standardization serve as the underlying basis of the physical measurement standards of activity that are needed in virtually every sub-discipline of radioanalytical and nuclear chemistry. Primary methods refer to the direct measurement of the number of nuclear transformations that occur per unit time, without recourse to other calibrations or standards. Such measurements, leading to the development and dissemination of radioactivity standards, are primarily performed under the purview of national metrology laboratories, like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the USA. This paper briefly reviews some of the various primary methods that have been developed by many such laboratories over many years. Their features and their role in ensuring the quality of radioactivity measurements are highlighted by several primary standardizations that have been recently performed at NIST.

Separation of cesium-137 from uranium fission products via a NeoflonA (R) column supporting tetraphenylboron	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd International Nuclear Chemistry Congress (2nd-INCC)	APR 13-17, 2008	Cancun, MEXICO					Cesium is a member of the Group I alkali metals, very reactive earth metals that react vigorously with both air and water. The chemistry of cesium is much like the chemistry of neighboring elements on the periodic table, potassium and rubidium. This close relation creates many problems in plant-life exposed to cesium because it is so easily confused for potassium, an essential nutrient to plants. Radioactive (134)Cs and (137)Cs are also chemically akin to potassium and stable cesium. Uptake of these radioactive isotopes from groundwater by plant-life destroys the plant-life and can potentially expose humans to the radioactive affects of (134)Cs and (137)Cs. Much experimental work has been focused on the separation of (137)Cs from uranium fission products. In previous experimental work performed a column consisting of Kel-F supporting tetraphenylboron (TPB) was utilized to separate (137)Cs from uranium fission products. It is of interest at this time to attempt the separation of (134)Cs from 0.01M EDTA using the same method and Neoflon in the place of Kel-F as the inert support. The results of this experiment give a separation efficiency of 88% and show a linear relationship between the column bed length and the separation efficiency obtained.	[Whitney, C.

Measurement of uranium in small quantities in phosphates by use of gamma-ray spectrometry and the 1001 keV peak of Pa-234m	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd International Nuclear Chemistry Congress (2nd-INCC)	APR 13-17, 2008	Cancun, MEXICO					Phosphates, naturally containing trace amounts of uranium, were examined using direct gamma-ray spectrometry. Both normal and Compton-suppressed counting modes were utilized. The 1001 keV photo peak of the second daughter of U-238 was chosen because of its isolation from other, potentially interfering peaks. The findings suggest that with the aid of Compton suppression, it is possible to quantify low uranium levels in phosphates using samples sizes of order 10 grams within an accuracy of 5%. The uranium content was determined in several sample types and was found to range from 60 +/- 4 to 70 +/- 8 mu g/g, depending on the sample composition. This investigation also considered the effects of sample size, counting time, and counting technique as sources of precision maximization. This work has shown that only a small amount of phosphate is needed to determine the constituent concentration, instead of the standard several hundred grams of material.

Scintillation phase method: A new approach for studying surfactant behavior at liquid/liquid interface	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd International Nuclear Chemistry Congress (2nd-INCC)	APR 13-17, 2008	Cancun, MEXICO				ADSORPTION; SOLUBILIZATION; SPECTROSCOPY	Radiochemical approach for the investigation of partitioning and adsorption of surfactants at water-oil interfaces has been developed. The so-called "scintillation phase method" is based on the introduction of tritium labeled surfactant in an aqueous phase of the water-oil system followed by measuring radioactivity of the whole system. Partition coefficients and the value of adsorption at water-non-polar liquid interfaces of homologous series of alkyltrimethylammonium bromides (DTAB, TTAB and CTAB) have been experimentally determined by means of scintillation phase method. The influence of non-ionic surfactants on TTAB adsorption has also been studied.	[Chernysheva, M. G.; Tyasto, Z. A.; Badun, G.

Extraction of molybdenum and technetium with diamides of dipicolinic acid from nitric acid solutions	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd International Nuclear Chemistry Congress (2nd-INCC)	APR 13-17, 2008	Cancun, MEXICO				SOLVENT-EXTRACTION; MONONUCLEAR; ACTINIDES; WASTES; TODGA	The concentration of molybdenum(VI) in dissolved spent nuclear fuel is comparable with the concentrations of Tc, and the minor actinides (Np, Am). Therefore it is of great interest to understand its behavior under conditions imposed by separation processes. The simultaneous extraction ability of ortho, meta, and para isomers of N,N'-diethyl-N,N'-ditolyl-dipicolinamide (EtTDPA) for molybdenum and technetium were investigated in a large range of nitric and hydrochloric acid conditions. Molybdenum shows no increase in extraction at higher concentrations of nitric acid giving a solvate number n=0 with all isomers of EtTDPA, while Mo shows great extractability from HCl. Technetium distribution ratios decrease with increasing concentrations of nitrate showing indication of ion exchange occurring between TcO(4) (-) and NO(3) (-) anions. Et(m)TDPA and Et(p)TDPA show the greatest extractability, with 60% of the total technetium extracted into the organic phase at 1M HNO(3).	[Lapka, J. L.; Paulenova, A.; Alyapyshev, M.
