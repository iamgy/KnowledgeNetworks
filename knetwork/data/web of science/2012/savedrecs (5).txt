Validation of actinide fluoride simulators for studying solubility in fuel salt of molten-salt reactors	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article							TRIFLUORIDE; BERYLLIUM; MIXTURES	The physicochemical, thermodynamic, and crystallographic properties of actinide and lanthanide fluorides are compared. On this basis, CeF3, LaF3, PrF3, ThF4, and UF4 were chosen to simulate PuF3, AmF3, CmF3, NpF4, and PuF4. Simulators will make it possible to decrease considerably the work in and costs of studying the individual and combined solubility of actinide fluorides and fission products in the low-melting fluoride melts used in molten-salt reactors for burning high-activity actinides.

J	Price, MST				Price, M. S. T.			The Dragon Project origins, achievements and legacies	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Topical Meeting on High Temperature Reactor Technology	OCT 18-20, 2010	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC					The lineage of the Dragon Project can be traced back to 1955 when the United Kingdom launched a nuclear power programme which involved the construction of large graphite moderated reactors fuelled with natural uranium and cooled by carbon dioxide. Not long afterwards the European Nuclear Energy Agency (ENEA) of the then newly formed Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC), in the spirit of the time, sought to encourage the construction of nuclear power stations and the development of joint nuclear undertakings. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) had, since 1949, been studying possible long term improvements in energy conversion efficiency resulting from higher coolant gas temperatures and the use of ceramic materials. A 1955 paper on gas-cooled reactors using the U-233/thorium cycle attracted interest and this progressed to the definition of an initial programme. The high temperature work led to a proposal for a 20 MW(Th) Reactor Experiment and one important consequence of the ENEA/OEEC initiative was the setting up in April 1959 of the international Dragon Project Agreement. Initial experiments at Harwell in 1957 had involved the coating of small spheroidal particles of uranium carbide or oxide with pyrolytic carbon which were then bonded with carbonaceous material. But experiments demonstrated that fission products such as caesium, strontium or barium could diffuse through such coatings. This led in 1961 to the modification of the coated particle design by the addition of an intermediate layer of silicon or zirconium carbide. The small size of the particles necessitated a statistical approach to quality during manufacture and effort was concentrated on the minimisation of the broken or defective particle fraction. The subsequent operation of the Dragon Reactor for over 10 years confirmed the benign nature of a HTR. It also proved that fuel bodies made with coated particles were capable of maintaining a high degree of fission product containment at high temperatures and for high burn-ups. What is remarkable is the speed with which the particle design evolved. The success of the choices that were made resulted in the High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor system being studied in its various forms by many countries. Irrespective of the particular core design, the basic component of HTR fuel is the coated particle. In the intervening years since the early HTRs were launched it has been realised worldwide that there are now even more factors favouring the use of high temperature reactors. They enable more efficient use of fissile isotopes as well as providing inherent reactor safety. Unlike most other reactor designs, the HTR can take economic advantage from operation at high gas outlet temperatures, whilst maintaining the good retention of fuel and fission products within the fuel elements. The fuel cycle can use uranium, thorium or plutonium. In addition the burn-up can be high, permitting safe disposal of spent fuel without the need for reprocessing. Fast reactors based on coated particle fuel may be a future possibility. The Dragon Project was a successful political collaboration and a technical triumph in demonstrating a new type of reactor. However, overstretched resources coupled with a world-wide trend in that era to favour water reactors caused work on Dragon to be terminated in March 1976. By then the main objectives for the Dragon Project had been successfully achieved and extensively reported. The progression from the 20 MWE(Th) Dragon to a 1200 MW(e) power station as a single jump in technology was too large a step for the time. The experiences of the other major civil HTR projects of the same period in Germany and the United States of America resulted in the high temperature reactor system being studied in its various forms by many countries as is evidenced by the large number of papers presented at the biennial HTR conferences. In the intervening years since the early HTRs were launched it has been realised that there are now even more factors favouring the use of high temperature reactors. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	McEachern, DW; Wu, W; Venneri, F				McEachern, Donald W.; Wu, Wen; Venneri, Francesco			Performance of PyC, SiC, ZrC coatings in the geologic repository	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Topical Meeting on High Temperature Reactor Technology	OCT 18-20, 2010	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC				SILICON-CARBIDE; OXIDATION-KINETICS; CORROSION; WATER; CERAMICS	The U.S. Deep-Burn Project is pursuing a fuel cycle that uses transuranic material taken from Light-Water Reactor (LWR) spent fuel in a High Temperature Reactor (HTR) to extract energy and transmute long-lived radionuclides. Burning transuranic radionuclides (TRU) from LWR spent fuel in a Deep-Burn High Temperature Reactor (DB-HTR) without addition of fertile material is an efficient and cost-effective way to process spent LWR fuel for disposal. With one coated particle fuel fabrication and one pass through the core, the HTR uses 95% of the energy from the fissile plutonium, and reduces the inventory of long-lived radionuclides by up to 60% by transmutation and fission. Public protection equivalent to that achieved by multi-recycle in a fast spectrum reactor can be achieved by disposing of the spent Deep-Burn fuel without further reprocessing - relying on the corrosion resistant TRISO or TRIZO coatings to contain the long-lived radioisotopes until they decay to low levels in the geologic repository. Coated particle behavior in a geologic repository is predicted here using coating corrosion data from a new, more comprehensive compilation in the one-dimensional, finite element fuel performance code PISA. Because of uncertainties associated with the properties of irradiated coatings and the mechanisms and rates of corrosion of coatings in repositories, the predictions made in this analysis are not quantitative but may be useful indicators of the behavior of the particle coatings. The uncertainties notwithstanding, our results indicate that integrity and radionuclide retention by coated particles are much longer than for other waste forms. SiC coated particles corrode slowly in dry and moist air and can survive for long times. If protected by the outer pyrocarbon coatings SiC can be an effective radionuclide barrier in aqueous media for long times; exposure to aqueous media substantially shortens the life of SiC coatings. ZrC coatings oxidize readily in repository air and provide less protection than SiC. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, ML; Liu, B; Shao, YL				Liu, Malin; Liu, Bing; Shao, Youlin			Optimization of the UO2 kernel coating process by 2D simulation of spouted bed dynamics in the coater	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Topical Meeting on High Temperature Reactor Technology	OCT 18-20, 2010	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC				FUEL PARTICLES; SIC COATINGS; GAS; COEFFICIENT; DEPOSITION; REACTOR	In the present study, a 2D Euler-Euler numerical simulation was carried out to study the hydrodynamics in the spouted bed with different gas velocities and gas inlets (single-nozzle and multi-nozzle). The maximum spouted height could be mainly determined by the gas velocity if the packing heights of particles were the same. The spatial distribution of particles was uneven and the aggregation of them near the wall could be found when using the single-nozzle gas inlet, regardless of the gas velocity. The aggregation of particles could be partly reduced by using the multi-nozzle gas inlet instead. The dead zone could be eliminated under appropriate particle loading by using the spouted bed bottom with the multi-nozzle gas inlet. Based on the simulation results, the appropriate gas distributor design was recommended to increase the gas solid contact efficiency. It can also be revealed that the temperature would affect the physical properties of gas and particles, thus affecting the particle fluidized state from the simulation results. The maximum spouted height increased with increasing temperature, but the quantitative comparison between the simulation results and the experimental ones can not be obtained because of the limitation of the measuring techniques at high temperature. The present investigation showed that the gas distributor had a critical impact on the gas-particle contact efficiency in the gas-solid two-phase system in the spouted bed, and CFD is a good alternative tool to optimize the spouted bed design in researching the coating process of the UO2 kernel.

PYCASSO: Irradiation of HTR coated particles at high temperatures	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Topical Meeting on High Temperature Reactor Technology	OCT 18-20, 2010	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC				NUCLEAR HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION	The PYCASSO (PYrocarbon irradiation for Creep And Swelling/Shrinkage of Objects) irradiations were a part of RAPHAEL (ReActor for Process Heat And Electricity), a 4-year Integrated Project on Very High Temperature Reactors, which started in April 2005 as part of the European 6th Framework Program. In the Fuel Technology Sub-Project (SP-FT), the PYCASSO experiments were performed to determine the effect of high temperature (900-1100 degrees C) irradiation on thermo-mechanical properties of various coating materials for TRISO coated particle fuel. Effects due to the presence of fuel, such as pressurization or chemical attack by fission products, have been excluded by irradiating surrogate (ZrO2 and Al2O3) kernels. The partners involved in this irradiation are CEA (France), JAEA (Japan) and KAERI (Republic of South Korea). The PYCASSO irradiations have taken place in the High Flux Reactor (HFR) Petten and were coordinated by NRG (The Netherlands). In this paper we will discuss the performance of PYCASSO-I by a direct comparison between the in-pile behavior of the experiment and the behavior of the corresponding finite element model. The experience of PYCASSO-I led to recommendations for the follow-up irradiation PYCASSO-II irradiation, of which the performance is also presented. The PYCASSO-I experiment has been successfully dismantled, which was a complex procedure of retrieving samples from the highly activated sample holders. The dismantling was successful, as demonstrated by relatively low sample activity, which will most likely allow exporting the samples from hot cells and enable PIE in a glovebox. Also the measured fluence is reported, which shows that the experiment fluence target has been perfectly met. Finally, the proposed PIE for the PYCASSO-I and PYCASSO-II samples in the ARCHER FP7 proposal is presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Knol, S.; de Groot, S.; Hania, P.

J	Moses, DL				Moses, David L.			Nuclear safeguards considerations for pebble bed reactors (PBRs)	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Topical Meeting on High Temperature Reactor Technology	OCT 18-20, 2010	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC					Recent reports by the Department of Energy National Laboratories have discussed safeguards considerations for low enriched uranium (LEU)-fueled pebble bed reactors (PBRs) and the need for bulk accountancy of the plutonium in "used fuel." These reports fail to account for the degree of plutonium dilution in the graphitized-carbon pebbles that is sufficient to meet the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) "provisional" guidelines for termination of safeguards on "measured discards." The thrust of this finding is not to terminate safeguards but to limit the need for specific accountancy of plutonium in stored used fuel. While the residual uranium in the used fuel is not sufficiently diluted to meet the IAEA provisional guidelines for termination of safeguards, the estimated quantities of the uranium minor isotopes U-232 and U-236 in the used fuel at the target burnup of similar to 90 Gigawatt-days per metric ton (GWD/MT) exceed standard specification limits for reprocessed uranium and will require extensive blending with either natural uranium or uranium enrichment tails to dilute the U-236 content to fall within specification. Hence, the PBR used fuel is less desirable for commercial reprocessing and reuse than that from light water reactors. Also the PBR specific activity of a reprocessed uranium isotopic mixture and its A(2) values for effective dose limits if released in a dispersible form during a transportation accident are more limiting than the equivalent values for light-water-reactor used fuel at 55 GWD/MT without accounting for the presence of the principal carry-over fission product (technetium, Tc-99) and plutonium contamination. Thus, the potentially recoverable uranium from PBR used fuel carries reactivity penalties and radiological penalties likely greater than those for reprocessed uranium from light water reactors. These factors impact the economics of reprocessing, but a more significant consideration is that reprocessing technologies for coated particle fuels encased in graphitized carbon have not progressed beyond laboratory-scale demonstrations. However, key equipment that has been tested in the past (such as graphite burners and electrolytic disintegration/dissolution devices) is not listed on either the "Trigger List" or the "Dual Use List" for mandatory export controls. If gross burnup determined from fission-product gamma-ray inspection of a discharged pebble cannot be correlated acceptably with predicted plutonium content of the pebble, development and testing may be required on detector concepts for more directly measuring the plutonium content in a discharged pebble to ensure that its placement in the spent fuel storage tanks is for an acceptable measured discard of diluted plutonium.

Utilization of HTR reflector graphite as embedding matrix for radioactive waste	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Topical Meeting on High Temperature Reactor Technology	OCT 18-20, 2010	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC					The reflector graphite of an HTR reactor has to be handled as radioactive waste after the operational period of the reactor. However the waste management of irradiated graphite from Magnox reactors shows, that waste management of even low contaminated graphite could be expensive and requires special retrieval, treatment and disposal technologies for safe long term storage as low or medium radioactive waste. However the reflector graphite could be transferred into long term stable embedding matrix for high level radioactive waste especially for HTR fuel elements. This can be achieved by closing the pore system of the graphite with a stable inorganic binder, e.g. glass. First investigations proved the sealing of the pore system and the potential for embedding HTR fuel pebbles. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Fachinger, J.; Grosse, K.

Especially for the emerging nations the HTR Technology has become of special interest because of its inherent safety feature and due to the alternative possibilities of applications, e.g. in the production of liquid hydrocarbons or the alternative application in H-2 generation. The HTR fuel in its various forms (spheres or prismatic fuel blocks) is based on small fuel kernels of about 500 mu m in diameter. Each of these uranium oxide or carbide kernels are coated with several layers of pyrocarbon (PyC) as well as an additional silicon carbide (SiC) layer. While the inner pyrocarbon layer is porous and capable to absorb gaseous fission products, the dense outer PyC layer forms the barrier against fission product release. The SiC layer improves the mechanical strengths of this barrier and considerably increases the retention capacity for solid fission products that tent to diffuse at these temperatures. Especially the high quality German LEU TRISO spherical fuel based on the NUKEM design, has demonstrated the best fission product release rate, particular at high temperatures. The similar to 10% enriched uranium triple-coated particles are embedded in a moulded graphite sphere. A fuel sphere consists of approximately 9 g of uranium (some 15,000 particles) and has a diameter of 60 mm. As the unique safety features, especially the inherent safety of the HTR is based on the fuel design, this paper shall reflect the complexity but also developments and economical aspects of the fabrication processes for HTR fuel elements.

J	Phillips, JA; Nagley, SG; Shaber, EL				Phillips, Jeffrey A.; Nagley, Scott G.; Shaber, Eric L.			Fabrication of uranium oxycarbide kernels and compacts for HTR fuel	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Topical Meeting on High Temperature Reactor Technology	OCT 18-20, 2010	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC				PARTICLE CROSS-SECTIONS; IRRADIATION PERFORMANCE; HTGR FUEL	As part of the program to demonstrate tristructural isotropic (TRISO)-coated fuel for the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP), Advanced Gas Reactor (AGR) fuel is being irradiation tested in the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) at Idaho National Laboratory (INL). This testing has led to improved kernel fabrication techniques, the formation of TRISO fuel particles, and upgrades to the overcoating, compaction and heat treatment processes. Combined, these improvements provide a fuel manufacturing process that meets the stringent requirements associated with testing in the AGR experimentation program. Researchers at INL are working in conjunction with a team from Babcock and Wilcox (B&W) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to (a) improve the quality of uranium oxycarbide (UCO) fuel kernels, (b) deposit TRISO layers to produce a fuel that meets or exceeds the standard developed by German researches in the 1980s, and (c) develop a process to overcoat TRISO particles with the same matrix material, but apply it with water using equipment previously and successfully employed in the pharmaceutical industry. A primary goal of this work is to simplify the process, making it more robust and repeatable while relying less on operator technique than prior overcoating efforts. A secondary goal is to improve first-pass yields to greater than 95% through the use of established technology and equipment. In the first test, called "AGR-1," graphite compacts containing approximately 300,000 coated particles were irradiated from December 2006 to November 2009. The AGR-1 fuel was designed to closely replicate many of the properties of German TRISO-coated particles thought to be important for good fuel performance. No release of gaseous fission product, indicative of particle coating failure, was detected in the nearly 3-year irradiation to a peak burn up of 19.6% at a time-average temperature of 1038-1121 degrees C. Before fabricating AGR-2 fuel, each fabrication process was improved and changed. Changes to the kernel fabrication process included replacing the carbon-black powder feed with a surface-modified carbon slurry and shortening the sintering schedule. AGR-2 TRISO particles were produced in a 6-inch diameter coater using a charge size about 21-times that of the 2-inch diameter coater used to coat AGR-1 particles. The compacting process was changed to increase matrix density and throughput by increasing the temperature and pressure of pressing and using a different type of press. AGR-2 fuel began irradiation in the ATR in late spring 2010. The high quality UCO kernels used in the AGR fuel tests at ATR were produced by B&W. Fuel for the AGR-1 test (350 mu m, 19.7% U-235-enriched UCO kernels) was produced in 2005. Fuel for the AGR-2 test (425-mu m, 14% enriched UCO kernels and 500-mu m, 9.6% enriched UO2 kernels) was produced in 2008. Fuel of the same size and enrichment as AGR-1 kernels were produced for the AGR-3/4 experiment, yet to be irradiated. B&W has also produced more than 100 kg of natural uranium UCO kernels, which are being used in coating development tests. Successive kernel lots also demonstrate consistent high quality and allow for fabrication process improvements. Improvements in kernel forming were made subsequent to AGR-1 kernel production. Following fabrication of AGR-2 kernels, incremental increases in sintering furnace charge size have been demonstrated. Recently, small-scale sintering tests using a small development furnace equipped with a residual gas analyzer (RGA) have increased understanding of how kernel sintering parameters affect sintered kernel properties. The steps taken to increase throughput and process knowledge have reduced kernel production costs. Other modifications have been studied to increase the current fabrication line capacity for producing first core fuel for the NGNP and to provide a basis for the design of a full-scale fuel fabrication facility. INL and B&W are evaluating an alternative hot-press compaction methodology to yield higher matrix densities, generate less waste, and increase compaction rates without any compromise in compact quality. A variety of process approaches are available and have been historically used to manufacture cylindrical fuel compacts. jet milling, fluid-bed overcoating, and hot-press compacting approaches being adopted by the U.S. Advanced Gas Reactor Fuel Development Program for scale-up of the compacting process involve significant paradigm shifts from historical approaches. These new methods are being pursued simply to increase yields and eliminate process mixed waste. Recent advances in jet-milling technology simplify dry matrix powder preparation. The matrix preparation method is well matched with patented fluid-bed powder overcoating technology, recently developed for the pharmaceutical industry and directly usable for overcoating high-density fuel-particle-matrix. High-density overcoating places fuel particles as close as possible to their final position in the compact and is matched with hot-press compacting, which fully fluidizes matrix resin to achieve die fill at low compacting pressures and without matrix end caps. Overall, the revised methodology provides a simpler process that should provide very high yields, improve homogeneity, further reduce defect fractions, eliminate intermediate grading and quality control steps, and allow further increases in fuel packing fractions. The compacting process for AGR fuel is being scaled-up from a laboratory process to an engineering-scale process ready for replication to meet production requirements. The scale-up effort was started after a year of planning and evaluation. It continues today on the baseline premise of designing a safe, efficient, and cost effective compacting system and adjusting graphite and resin material characteristics as needed to achieve all specification requirements, high yields, and an optimum product within that design. At this writing, the scale-up effort is 20 months into the execution phase. The B&W compacting facility was readied, and the required scale-up process equipment purchased, factory tested, and received. Its installation is nearing completion. By the end of March 2011, overcoating of natural uranium oxycarbide (NUCO) particles for process finalization testing can begin. The fuel qualification test of AGR-5/6 compacts is scheduled in approximately 23 months, so finalizing the process is gaining urgency. Process engineering work on unit operations for compacting has streamlined the fabrication approach, eliminated waste management issues, and allowed specification, design, and purchase of engineering-scale equipment appropriate for efficient compact manufacturing. A set of process-detail surrogate tests were initiated in the summer of 2010 to determine the components and process parameters appropriate for production compacting.

Dust in HTRs: Its nature and improving prediction of its resuspension	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Topical Meeting on High Temperature Reactor Technology	OCT 18-20, 2010	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC				PARTICLE RESUSPENSION; TURBULENT FLOWS; REACTOR	The HTR primary-system environment comprises nuclear graphites, alloys, dust (primarily carbonaceous) and high-purity helium. The amount of carbonaceous dust produced in a pebble-bed system would be considerably greater than one using a prismatic core with a significant contribution arising from the partially-graphitized binder of the pebbles. The dust is very fine, <10 mu m in size. Experience with HTRs shows the primary system to be contaminated by the isotopes Cs-134, Cs-137, Sr-90, (110)mAg, I-131, Xe-135, Kr-85 and tritium at a level representing an occupational-health issue rather than a safety issue. However, strong sorption of caesium, strontium, iodine and tritium onto carbonaceous dust has been observed. Hence, the extent to which deposited dust can be resuspended during a depressurization accident is a safety issue since the dust comprises the main vector for release of radioactivity into the confinement. For fine dust on a surface, the principal force keeping it in place arises from inter-molecular (van der Waals) forces while aerodynamic forces, mainly drag, act to remove it. The reference model chosen here for improving resuspension predictions is the so-called Rock'n'Roll model. This model is based on a statistical approach leading to a resuspension rate for the escape of particles from a potential well via the action of the fluctuating aerodynamic force caused by turbulence. The as-published Rock'n'Roll model assumes that the fluctuations of the aerodynamic force obey a Gaussian distribution. Here, we introduce calculated statistics for the fluctuations taken from a large-eddy simulation of turbulent channel flow (work is in progress on generating these statistics using direct numerical simulation of turbulence). The overall influence of more-realistic (non-Gaussian) forces on the resuspension rate is found to be an increase in short-term resuspension. Given this and the fact that the adhesive force is based on an empirical correlation, work has started on developing specific modelling for multi-layer deposits. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

JRC's on-line fission gas release monitoring system in the high flux reactor Petten	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Topical Meeting on High Temperature Reactor Technology	OCT 18-20, 2010	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC					For HTR fuel irradiation tests in the HFR Petten a specific installation was designed and installed, dubbed the "Sweep Loop Facility" (SLF). The SLF is tasked with three functions, namely temperature control by gas mixture technique, surveillance of safety parameters (temperature, pressure, radioactivity etc.) and analysis of fission gas release for three individual capsules in two separate experiments. The SLF enables continuous and independent surveillance of all gas circuits. The release of volatile fission products of the in-pile experiments is monitored by continuous gas purging. The fractional release of these fission products, defined as the ratio between release rate of a gaseous fission isotope (measured) to its instantaneous birth rate (calculated), is a licensing-relevant test for HTR fuel. The newly developed gamma spectrometry station allows for higher measurement frequencies, thus enabling follow-up of rapid and massive release transients. The designed stand-alone system was tested and fully used through the final irradiation period of the HFR-EU1 experiment which was terminated on 18 February 2010. Its robustness allowed us to use it as extra safety instrumentation. This paper describes the gas activity measurement technique based on HPGe gamma spectrometry and illustrates how qualitative and quantitative analysis of volatile fission products can be performed on-line.

Major highlights include design, fabrication and testing of innovative helium components, improved fuel fabrication and fuel and materials irradiation, and safety testing and PIE of irradiated fuel. In the area of coupled reactor physics and core thermo fluid dynamics, benchmarks have been performed on core safety experiments on the AVR and HTR10 high temperature test reactors, and on the HFR EU1 bis fuel burn-up experiment. The fuel cycle back-end activities cover characterisation of V/HTR-specific waste, disposal behaviour and conditioning and spent fuel performance modelling. The materials activities comprise vessel and high-temperature materials, the latter work in collaboration with EXTREMAT. and graphite irradiation and characterisation. Safety and licensing assessments of a V/HTR, and the system integration aspects with respect to plant reference data and R&D results complete the comprehensive scope of RAPHAEL. Selected results will be made available as Euratom input for exchange within the GIF VHTR projects in negotiated procedures. Two advisory groups (safety-SAG and industrial users-IUAG) accompanied the project and provided valuable input regarding adjustment of concept specifications. The recommendations of the Industrial Users Advisory Group, including major end-users, are used as input to EUROPAIRS, an FP7 support action aiming at integrating end-users into the R&D process towards a demonstrator for cogeneration. To address the key issue of knowledge transfer, RAPHAEL conducted three Eurocourses, with support of the IAEA, to transmit V/HTR physics and technology to young engineers and students. Furthermore, RAPHAEL was regularly present in conferences and has issued numerous technical publications. RAPHAEL executed intensive international collaboration mainly in the areas of materials and fuel, in particular with Korea. and in safety. In addition, its representation and contribution was often requested in collaboration initiatives of Euratom with Russia and China, and in workshops organised by IAEA. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Pohl, C; Allelein, HJ				Pohl, Christoph; Allelein, Hans-Josef			Burning minor actinides in a HTR energy spectrum and effects on the final radiotoxicity	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Topical Meeting on High Temperature Reactor Technology	OCT 18-20, 2010	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC					The production of nuclear energy with existing nuclear reactors is equivalent to the use of low enriched uranium. But the neutron capture of the large corresponding U-238 fuel fraction also generates a buildup of plutonium isotopes and minor actinides as Neptunium. Americium and Curium. These actinides are dominant for the long time assessment of final disposal therefore a minimization of the long living isotopes is aspired. Burning the actinides in a high temperature helium cooled graphite moderated reactor (HTR) is one of these options. Using plutonium isotopes to sustain the criticality of the system is intended to avoid highly enriched uranium because of international regulations and low enriched uranium because of the build up of new actinides from neutron capture in U-238. Also fractions of plutonium isotopes are build up to minor actinides but for this absorption the overall number of actinides keeps constant Nevertheless for the final assessment the activity and toxicity of all important actinides have to be taken into account. This paper comprises calculations for plutonium/minor actinides/thorium fuel compositions, their correlated final burn-up and the long term activity and toxicity for a generic pebble bed HTR based on the reference design of the 400 MW PBMR. In particular the behaviour of the different minor actinide isotopes in the higher thermal energy spectrum of a HTR will be discussed. Thorium based fuel - as a promising alternative to uranium based fuel - offers several advantages as a minimized build up of new Pu and MA, a higher thermal conductivity and melting point. Combining the thorium fuel with a significant fraction of minor actinides and an isotope fraction consistent with burned LWR fuel the total amount of the minor actinides stays nearly unchanged while the isotope composition significantly changes. This behaviour with respect to the initial heavy metal load and the influence on the long term activity and toxicity will be discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Analysis of dust and fission products in a pebble bed NGNP	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Topical Meeting on High Temperature Reactor Technology	OCT 18-20, 2010	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC					In the HTR pebble bed reactor graphite dust is generated during normal reactor operation due to pebble-to-pebble interactions. This dust will be deposited throughout the primary system. Furthermore, the dust will become radioactive due to sorption of fission products released during normal operation. This paper presents an analysis of dust transport and deposition and fission product transport and plate-out during normal operation of a NGNP (next generation nuclear plant) Westinghouse pebble bed design. The main objective is to determine the amount and location of deposited graphite dust in the system and the amount of radioactive isotopes adsorbed on the structures and the dust during normal operation. The results will be used in planning of maintenance activities. Moreover the present results may be used in a next step to perform a depressurized loss of forced cooling (D-LOFC) analysis and to determine the amount of radioactivity released to the atmosphere during the accident. The analysis was performed using the SPECTRA code. Based on the assumed dust source term, during the 60 years lifetime of the pebble bed reactor concept which was analyzed approximately 1630 kg dust enters the primary helium flow. It was determined: (1) That 86% of the dust settles on the graphite structures inside the reactor vessel. Of the remaining graphite dust 2/3 collects in the low temperature intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) and the remaining dust in the high temperature IHX and the connecting pipes of the primary system. (2) Agglomeration of dust from smaller into larger particles is observed at all locations. The resuspension of agglomerated dust particles is an important phenomenon that limits the build-up of a dust layer on the surface of the IHXs. A large deposited dust layer is observed on the control rod drive (CRD) walls in the graphite structures. The dust accumulates on the CRD walls because, due to very low gas velocities, resuspension of the agglomerated particles does not occur. (3) The dust binds a significant amount of fission product vapors. Although the vapor concentrations are typically smaller on the dust surface than on the metallic surfaces, the dust particles have a relatively large surface. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Kalanxhi, E; Dahle, J				Kalanxhi, Erta; Dahle, Jostein			Transcriptional responses in irradiated and bystander fibroblasts after low dose alpha-particle radiation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						alpha-particle radiation; bystander effect; noncancerous fibroblasts; gene expression	DOUBLE-STRAND BREAKS; HIGH-LET RADIATION; CHROMOSOMAL INSTABILITY; IN-VIVO; TARGETED IRRADIATION; EPIGENETIC EFFECTORS; GENOMIC INSTABILITY; GENE-EXPRESSION; CYTOME ASSAY; CELLS	Purpose: The objective of this study was to demonstrate the radiation-induced bystander effect (RIBE) in human F11 fibroblasts using micronucleus (MN) formation as an end-point and to investigate transcriptional responses towards low doses of alpha-particle radiation in irradiated and bystander fibroblasts employing genome-wide microarray analysis. Materials and methods: The MN frequency was investigated in unirradiated bystander cells recipient of growth medium from alpha-particle irradiated (0, 0.1, 0.5 and 2 Gy) immortalized human F11 fibroblasts. The irradiated conditioned medium (ICM) was transferred from irradiated to bystander fibroblasts 2 h after irradiation. Microarray analysis was performed in 0.1 Gy alpha-particle irradiated cells, unirradiated bystander cells and appropriate controls at different time points after ICM transfer. Microarray data analysis was performed at the single-gene level and gene-set level. Results: MN were induced in unirradiated fibroblasts recipient of ICM harvested from 0.1 Gy alpha-particle irradiated cultures, but not from cultures irradiated with 0.5 or 2 Gy. Fibroblasts irradiated with 0.1 Gy showed repression of 26 genes 4 h after being irradiated. However, no significantly altered genes were found in bystander fibroblasts at any of the time points used in this study. Gene-set enrichment analysis showed that pathways such as ribosome, protein export, proteasome and protein 53 (p53) signaling were enriched in irradiated cells. However, bystander cells were enriched only in the lysosome pathway 24 h after receiving ICM, indicating persistence of the signals received from the irradiated cells. Conclusion: MN formation was induced in bystander fibroblast receiving medium from 0.1 Gy alpha-particle irradiated fibroblasts, but this was accompanied with only minor transcriptional responses.

An off-line method to characterize the fission product release from uranium carbide-target prototypes developed for SPIRAL2 project	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Uranium carbide; Release time; Radioactive ion beams; Target; Composite; Fission products	RADIOACTIVE ION-BEAMS; ISOTOPE SEPARATOR; ONLINE PRODUCTION; ISOL TARGETS; IRRADIATION; TEMPERATURE; FUEL; FACILITY; JAEA	In the context of radioactive ion beams, fission targets, often based on uranium compounds, have been used for more than 50 years at isotope separator on line facilities. The development of several projects of second generation facilities aiming at intensities two or three orders of magnitude higher than today puts an emphasis on the properties of the uranium fission targets. A study, driven by Institut de Physique Nucleaire d'Orsay (IPNO), has been started within the SPIRAL2 project to try and fully understand the behavior of these targets. In this paper, we have focused on five uranium carbide based targets. We present an off-line method to characterize their fission product release and the results are examined in conjunction with physical characteristics of each material such as the microstructure, the porosity and the chemical composition.

The source, a gamma unit containing Cobalt-60 pencils, was improperly disposed of by a research institution in violation of national regulations for radiation protection and safety of radioactive sources. The unit was sold off to unsuspecting scrap dealers who dismantled the equipment. This event subsequently caused the most severe radiation accident reported in India to date, resulting in seven radiation injuries and one death. The clinical course of five of the patients treated at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences hospital, New Delhi, is summarised in this report. All five patients suffered from the haematological form of the acute radiation syndrome and local cutaneous radiation injury as well. While four patients exposed to doses between 0.6 and 2.8 Gy survived with intensive or supportive treatment, the patient with the highest exposure of 3.1 Gy died due to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure on Day 16 after hospitalisation. The incident highlights the current gaps in the knowledge, infrastructure and legislation in handling radioactive materials. Medical institutions need to formulate individualised triage and management guidelines to immediately respond to future public radiological accidents.	[Dey, A.

This report assesses the initial clinical status and the medical and psychological long-term follow-up of two radiation accident patients from Peru during the mid-to-late 1990s: one patient exposed to a radiotherapy Co-60 source in Arequipa, the other patient to a Ir-192 source in Yanango. Commonalities and differences are described. The main causes in both accidents were human error and the failure to apply appropriate safety guidelines and standard operating procedures. Education and training of the personnel working with radiation sources are essential to prevent accidents. The experience gained from the medical management of the two patients is valuable for future treatment of such patients.	[Barriga, L.

A multi gamma ray source of Eu-152 having similar to 1 mCi activity was used for the determination of attenuation correction factors for high count rate drums. Dead time corrections were applied to arrive at the corrected count rates for all the gamma rays. Present study has shown that the estimation of similar to 1 g of Pu-239 in a waste drum can be carried out in the presence of Cs-137 up to an activity level of 20 mCi.

Solvent extraction of uranium from lean grade acidic sulfate leach liquor with alamine 336 reagent	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Symposium on Nuclear Analytical Chemistry (NAC)	NOV 15-19, 2010	Mumbai, INDIA			Uranium; Refractory minerals; Alamine 336; Solvent extraction; Leaching	U(VI)	This paper describes the solvent extraction studies carried out on an acidic low assay uranium bearing leach liquor generated during sulfuric acid leaching of a refractory uranium ore using alamine 336-isodecenol-kerosene reagent combine. The leach liquor has a U3O8 content of about 270 mg/L, free acidity 2.4 N H2SO4 and total dissolved solids concentration of 260 g/L. Process parameteric variation studies indicated strong influence of free acidity of the leach liquor, alamine 336 concentration and aqueous to organic phase ratio on the extraction efficiency of uranium. An extraction efficiency of about 95% was achieved when the free acidity of leach liquor was 1 N H2SO4 or lower, using 2% (v/v) alamine 336 at ambient temperature with an aqueous to organic phase ratio of 1:1. The loading capacity under these conditions was 1.2 g/L of U3O8. About 98% of the uranium values could be stripped from the loaded organic using 1 N NaCl in 0.2 N H2SO4. The solvent extraction studies aided in developing a suitable process flowsheet for treating refractory uranium ores which need high acidity during leaching and relatively lower acidity for purification by solvent extraction.

The presence of uranium in zircon has led to its increased use in the age determination of rocks. Zirconium is also considered as a strategic, hi-tech element because of its various applications, especially in the manufacturing, nuclear and aerospace industries. Analysis of zircon constitutes one of the tough tasks in analytical chemistry as it is a highly resistant mineral and it is extremely difficult to achieve its complete decomposition. In the present work, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry has been applied to the determination of hafnium, REE, uranium and thorium in zircon samples using two different sample dissolution procedures, one employing sodium peroxide fusion and another using a fusion mixture of KHF2 and NaF in 3:1 ratio. Some selected zircon samples originating from different places on the eastern coast of India have been analysed by both the methods and values obtained by both methods were found to be in good agreement with each other. Though a number of international zircon reference materials are available, certified or even proposed values are available only for a very few elements in them. Two zircon reference materials have also been analysed by both methods and usable values have been proposed in this paper. The values obtained by both methods were found to compare well with each other and as well with those reported in literature. The % RSD for all the estimated elements varied from 1.0 to 12.0% at different concentration levels.	[Singh, A.

The thermal and radiation stability of the compound was checked by TGA technique and a gamma-irradiating chamber with a total dose rate of 5 kGy/h. The compound is highly stable towards thermal, chemical and total radiation dose of 64 kGy. The study of the exchange capacity of the material towards different alkali and alkaline earth metal ions showed that the sorption capacities of the alkali metal ions were greater than those of alkaline earth metal ions. The crystalline state of this new inorganic material is very useful as an inorganic ion exchanger to have the carrier free short-lived beta-active daughter product Y-90 from the long-lived Sr-90 of the radioactive equilibrium mixture. The absorbed daughter was recovered by using 1.0% EDTA solutions at pH 7.0 as eluting agent. The features and trends in elution are encouraging to apply this material as an exchanger in radionuclide generator system.

Cu-64 is generally produced by Ni-64 (p, n) reaction in a cyclotron for medical use. High specific activity 'no carrier added' grade Cu-64 by Zn-64 (n, p) route is an alternative for research studies and was hence explored. 10 mg zinc foil target (48.63% in Zn-64) was irradiated in the medium flux reactor Dhruva at a thermal neutron flux of similar to 5.6 x 10(13) n cm(-2) s(-1) for 3 days. The irradiated Zn foil was dissolved in 5 mL 10 M HCl and Cu-64 was separated by anion exchange chromatography (Dowex 1 x 8; 100-200 mesh) at 3 M HCl conditions. Cu-64 radioactivity content and its radionuclide purity were ascertained by gamma-ray spectrometry using HPGe detector coupled to a 4 K multichannel analyser system. Radiochemical separation yielded a radionuclidic purity of 99.9% Cu-64.	[Vimalnath, K. V.; Rajeswari, A.; Jagadeesan, K. C.; Viju, C.; Joshi, P.

Studies on testing and evaluation of platinum plated titanium electrode for production of uranous nitrate	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Symposium on Nuclear Analytical Chemistry (NAC)	NOV 15-19, 2010	Mumbai, INDIA			Purex; Uranous; Platinum; Plating; Beta back scatter; SEM		Partitioning of plutonium from uranium is an important step in the reprocessing of spent fuel by PUREX process of solvent extraction using 30% TBP-dodecane. This is achieved by selectively reducing the Pu in solution to least extractable trivalent state by uranous nitrate as the reductant. The latter is conventionally produced by electrolytic reduction of uranyl ion in presence of hydrazine nitrate as uranous nitrate stabilizer using Pt-coated titanium as the anode. The anode plating wears out after period of operation thus affecting the process efficiency and hence the quality control testing of platinum plated electrode becomes important. This article describes the use of Beta backscattering method with strontium-90 radioisotope as non-destructive testing tool for measuring the coating thickness of the sample Ti electrode. The surface characteristics and coating morphology were also examined by scanning electron microscope and the micrographs are presented.	[Singh, Kulwant; Bidaye, A.

Total plutonium (Pu-238,Pu- 239,Pu- 240,Pu- 241 & 242) concentration in the sample is analysed by HTTA (Thenoyl Trifluoro Acetone) extraction method wherever interference from other alpha emitting nuclides (Raffinate) and bulk natural uranium (uranium products) are present "as reported by Milyukov et al. (Analytical chemistry of plutonium, 1967) and Natarajan and Subba Rao (BARC, pp. 38-43, 2007)". This method requires the addition of corrosive reagents such as NH2OH.HCl which is a problem in waste disposal for reduction. A salt-free reagent such as Hydroxyurea is studied as a reducing agent which has the ability to reduce both Pu(VI) and Pu(IV) to Pu(III) "as reported by Zhaowu (260(3):601-606, 2004) and Zhaowu (262(3):707-711, 2004)". Pu(III) thus formed can be easily oxidised to Pu(IV) by NaNO2 for the extraction of Pu by HTTA.	[Sivakumar, P.; Mohan, S. V.; Rao, R. V.

In the present study the sorption kinetics of uranium was studied in soil and the influence parameters to the sorption process, such as initial uranium concentration, pH, contact time and temperature were investigated. Distribution coefficient of uranium on soil was measured by laboratory batch method. Experimental isotherms evaluated from the distribution coefficients were fit to Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) models. The sorption energy for uranium from the D-R adsorption isotherm was calculated to be 7.07 kJ mol(-1).The values of Delta H and Delta S were calculated to be 37.33 kJ mol(-1) and 162 J K-1 mol(-1), respectively. Delta G at 30 A degrees C was estimated to be -11.76 kJ mol(-1). From sorption kinetics of uranium the reaction rate was calculated to be 1.6 x 10(-3) min(-1).

Application of particle induced gamma-ray emission for non-destructive determination of fluorine in barium borosilicate glass samples	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Symposium on Nuclear Analytical Chemistry (NAC)	NOV 15-19, 2010	Mumbai, INDIA			Barium borosilicate glass; Fluorine; PIGE; Proton beam; In situ current normalization; RBS; Gamma-ray spectrometry	STRUCTURAL ASPECTS; THORIUM; PIXE	Barium borosilicate glass (BaBSG) is proposed as a potential candidate for vitrification of nuclear waste generated from thoria based nuclear reactors. Along with fission products, activation products and many inactive chemicals, like fluorine in the form of HF are expected to be present in the dissolver solution with nuclear waste. As vitrification occurs at high temperature, it is important to quantify fluorine in BaBSG. Due to its complex matrix, most of the wet chemical and nuclear analytical methods encounter problems in the estimation of fluorine. Particle induced gamma-ray emission (PIGE) method has been standardized for non-destructive determination of fluorine contents in BaBSG samples utilizing measurement of prompt gamma-rays from F-19 (p, p'gamma) F-19 reaction. Experiments have been carried out with thick pellet targets prepared in cellulose matrix using 4 MeV proton beam from the folded tandem ion accelerator at BARC, Mumbai. For obtaining current normalized count rate of interest, beam current variation was monitored by the Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) method as well as by the in situ approach using an externally added element sensitive to PIGE. In this paper standardization of PIGE methods for F determination, validation of methods using synthetic samples, and application to BaBSG samples are reported.

Determination of concentrations of U and Th in their mixed oxides by INAA methods	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Symposium on Nuclear Analytical Chemistry (NAC)	NOV 15-19, 2010	Mumbai, INDIA			AHWR; Mixed oxide fuel; U and Th; Thermal NAA; Epithermal NAA; Reactor neutron; Gamma ray spectrometry	NEUTRON-ACTIVATION ANALYSIS; NUCLEAR-DATA; REACTOR; THORIUM	Uranium and thorium mixed oxides are being prepared using natural U and Th for studies on fuels for Advanced Heavy Water Reactors, wherein composition of U and Th is specific and requires strict control in terms their contents and homogeneity. Chemical quality control necessitates accurate and precise compositional characterization of the fuel material by a suitable analytical method. Among various analytical methods for U and Th, instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) is one of the best methods for their simultaneous determination without chemical dissolution and separation. INAA methods using reactor neutrons namely thermal NAA and epithermal NAA were standardized for the determination of U and Th in their mixed oxides. Standards, synthetic samples and U-Th mixed oxide samples, prepared in cellulose matrix, were irradiated at pneumatic carrier facility of Dhruva reactor as well as at self serve facility of CIRUS reactor under cadmium cover (0.5 mm). Radioactive assay was carried out using a 40% relative efficiency HPGe detector. Both activation and daughter products of U-238 (U-239 and Np-239) and Th-232 (Th-233 and Pa-233) were used for their concentration determination. The method was validated by analyzing synthetic samples of 6-48%U-Th mixed oxides. The standardized method was used for the concentration determination of U and Th in 4-30%U-Th mixed oxide samples. Results of U and Th concentrations including associated uncertainties obtained from the INAA methods are presented in this paper.	[Acharya, R.; Gupta, Ruma; Pujari, P.

Performance of HPGe gamma spectrometry system for the measurement of low level radioactivity	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Symposium on Nuclear Analytical Chemistry (NAC)	NOV 15-19, 2010	Mumbai, INDIA			Radioactivity; Gamma spectrometry; HPGe; Quality Control	RAY SPECTROMETRY; RADIONUCLIDES; SAMPLES	Comprehensive quality assurance/quality control procedure is very much necessary to obtain accurate and precise analytical measurement result. This paper discusses the quality control aspects of the High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) based gamma spectrometry system, which has been used for the measurement of low-level radioactivity in environmental samples. The gamma spectrometry system consisting of coaxial n-type HPGe detector having 50% relative efficiency with respect to 7.62 cm x 7.62 cm NaI (Tl), Nuclear Instrumentation Module (NIM) based pulse processing electronic accessories and 8 k MCA. To reduce the background contribution, 7.5 cm thick lead has been placed surrounding the detector. The minimum detectable activities (MDA) with 95% confidence level (for 300 g soil sample and 100,000 s counting time) for important radionuclides such as U-238, Ra-226, Th-232, K-40, and Cs-137 are 10.4, 4.3, 4.1, 16.9 and 0.1 Bq kg(-1), respectively. The Quality control (X bar R) charts were plotted using Cs-137 and K-40 background counts observed periodically, which showed that the fluctuation is well within the confidence limit and confirms the stability of the system. The laboratory has been participating in the proficiency tests (PTs) of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). In recently concluded PTs, the samples include soil, spiked standard solution, spinach, phosphogypsum and spiked air filter were analysed for the natural, fission and activation products radionuclides. The performance evaluation of the IAEA PTs showed that the laboratory results were in good agreement with the target value, which confirms the reliability and traceability of the gamma spectrometric measurement result of the laboratory.

The radiation dose of the waste solution was reduced by radiochemical separation of cesium from HLW by solvent extraction with chlorinated cobalt dicarbollide dissolved in 20% nitrobenzene in xylene. Minor actinides (Np, Pu, Am, Cm) in the high level waste were assayed by alpha spectrometry following radiochemical separation. The gross alpha activity determined by liquid scintillation agrees well (within 10%) with the cumulative quantities of actinides determined by alpha spectrometry.	[Kar, A. S.; Tomar, B.

Therefore, nondestructive assay (NDA) methods are being developed to assay Pu mass in SFAs. Uncertainty quantification is an important task in most assay methods, and particularly for SFA assay. A computer model (MCNPX) is being used to predict isotope masses and the spatial distribution of masses in virtual SFAs for 64 combinations of initial fuel enrichment (IE), fuel utilization [burnup (BU)], and cooling time (CT) values. Additional MCNPX modeling for the same 64 virtual SFAs provided the expected detector responses (DRs) for several NDA techniques such as the passive neutron albedo reactivity method and the Cf-252 interrogation with prompt neutrons method. A previous paper describes one uncertainty quantification approach involving Monte Carlo (MC) simulation using individually any of six new NDA options together with IE, BU, and CT. This paper provides an interpretation of the MC approach that is suited for a numerical Bayesian alternative. separately assesses the impact of MCNPX interpolation error, and compares several options to use subsets of IE, BU, CT, and one DR.

The B4C powder is composed of particles with a narrow size distribution, with a d(50) (mean diameter) of 0.65 pm. The amount of B4C particles dispersed decreased exponentially with increasing dispersion time. The dispersibility of B4C particles increased with an increase in the loading of B4C particles and reached a maximum value at 12.91 wt%. The zeta potential of the B4C suspension was measured as a function of pH and temperature. The B4C suspension has a negative zeta potential value in the pH range between 2 and 12. The dispersion of B4C particles was not greatly influenced by the addition of boric acid (H3BO3). The absolute value of the zeta potential decreased with increasing temperature.

Fluctuations of Mass Yield Distribution for the Epithermal Fission of U-235 and Its Impact on HCLWR Calculations	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							SCISSION	The need for accurate nuclear data represents a permanent challenge to improve the calculation tools used in reactor physics. Uranium-235 is one of the most important isotopes, and its related nuclear data need to be known with a high degree of accuracy. In this context, many studies have been undertaken to improve the fission yields of U-235 for the main fission products in spent fuels. For a few years, an increasing interest has been observed for high-conversion light water reactors, for better use of the fuel and for nonproliferation considerations. These concepts are based on a low moderation ratio (similar to 0.9) and the use of highly enriched mixed oxide fuels (>8%). Because of a neutron flux much harder than in pressurized water reactors, calculations require a good knowledge of nuclear data in the epithermal range to accurately predict the fuel depletion with burnup. In particular, the energy dependence of the fission yields must be considered, because of the existence of fluctuations of the fragment fission yields in the resonances of U-235(n,f). Unfortunately, the fluctuations are incorrectly taken into account in calculation codes because of the rough energy description in the usual nuclear data libraries. In this paper, integral experiments are presented for the identification and the quantification of this effect in an almost 1/E neutron spectrum. The experiments consist of the irradiation of U-235 samples in the MINERVE reactor (CEA Cadarache), first in a mostly thermal neutron spectrum and second in a mostly epithermal one. Measurements of some abundant fission products are realized with gamma-ray spectrometry and show fluctuations of the U-235 cumulative fission yields between the two experiments. Results are interpreted with the multimodal random neck rupture model as a variation of 5% of the weight ratio w(1)/w(2) between the standard I and standard II fission modes, and compared with the differential experiments.

In order to explain the difference of the degradation rates, the quasi-two phase material model is proposed to assess the thermal conductivity degradation of the MIMAS MOX fuel, which takes into account the Pu agglomerate distributions in the MOX fuel matrix as fabricated. As a result, the quasi-two phase model calculation shows the gradual increase of the difference with burnup and may expect more than 10% higher thermal conductivity values around 75 GWd/t. While these results are not fully suitable for thermal conductivity degradation models implemented by some industrial fuel manufacturers, they are consistent with the results from the irradiation tests and indicate that the inhomogeneity of Pu content in the MOX fuel can be one of the major reasons for the moderation of the thermal conductivity degradation of the MOX fuel.

An agitating granulator equipped with three blades and a chopper was used and its performance was evaluated. Characteristics and physical properties of the raw powder and the granules were measured together with observations by scanning electron microscopy before/after granulation. We could obtain the granules of 120-140 mm in diameter within a narrow range of water addition ratio 12.5-13.5 wt% combined with a flow-ability 473 and a product yield 490%. Specific surface area that corresponds to sintering performance was almost the same as that of raw powder. When the ratio was 59 wt%, no granule was observed, and flow-ability did not change from that of raw powder <30. It was estimated from an additional experiment that the reason was capillaries (or voids) in the raw powder. When the ratio was more than 14 wt%, the flow-ability saturated and the product yield decreased. This narrow range of water addition ratio and strong binding force were successfully understood based on the standard theory of granulation supposing the Pendular state and the Gorge method.

In order to find out precipitants with high selectivity to U(VI) and to investigate factors controlling precipitation ability to U(VI) and U(IV), properties of 3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-1,3-dimethyl-2(1H)-pyrimidinone (DMPU) as a precipitant have been examined by using U(VI), U(IV) as a simulant of Pu(IV), and simulated fission products (FPs). We have evaluated precipitation ratios (P. R.) for U(VI) and U(IV), solubility of U(VI) precipitates to 3.0 mol dm(-3) (M) HNO3 solution, melting points (MPs) of U(VI) precipitates, log P (distribution ratio of a substance in 1-octanol/water biphasic system, a measure of hydrophobicity) of precipitants, and decontamination factors (DFs) of FPs. The properties of DMPU were compared with those in systems using N-n-butyl-2-pyrrolidone (NBP), N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone (NCP), and other pyrrolidone derivatives as the precipitant. The P. R. values of DMPU to U(VI) and U(IV) in 3.0 M HNO3 solutions were around 99% at [DMPU]/[U(VI)] = 2.0 and 0% at [DMPU]/[U(IV)] = 5.0, respectively. In DMPU system, the DF values of the most of simulated FPs [Rb(I), Cs(I), Sr(II), Ba(II), Ru(III), Rh(III), La(III), Ce(III), Pr(III), Nd(III), and Sm(III)] used in the present study were found to be more than 100. Even in U(VI)-U(IV) coexisting system, the selectivity of DMPU to U(VI) was higher than those of NBP and NCP. This selective precipitation ability of DMPU to U(VI) was evaluated by the solubility of U(VI) precipitates on the basis of their MPs and the log P values of precipitants. As a result, it was found that the precipitants having low hydrophobicity and forming the U(VI) precipitates with high MPs have highly selective precipitation ability to U(VI).

The MCNP code was used for the analysis. Calculation model geometry was fully detailed, and ENDF, JENDL, JEFF, and TENDL libraries were used during calculation. For the cross sections of erbium nuclides, the analysis revealed that calculated results upon all the libraries corresponded with experimental data within the errors. However, in some libraries, significant differences were found in case of carbon and uranium nuclides under certain conditions.

However, from a criticality safety point of view, such high enrichment levels require a significant investment for the considerable modification of most facilities and equipment. Erbia-credit super-high-burnup fuel offers an effective solution that can solve the problem: Small amounts of erbia added to the entire amount of UO2 powder can reduce the reactivity level to less than that observed at a 5 wt% enrichment level, thus eliminating the need for the modifications mentioned above. A series of criticality safety analyses has been performed to determine the minimum and sufficient content of erbia that can guarantee a suitable erbia credit. As a noteworthy result, the erbia content required was determined for corresponding values of uranium enrichment in a range >5 wt%, as indicated in our EGOS (Erbia COntent for Sub-criticality judgment) diagram. This paper outlines a series of criticality safety analyses and explains how the minimum erbia content can be determined to ensure sub-criticality for a >5 wt% enrichment fuel to ensure that the fuel obtained is equivalent to that whose enrichment is <5 wt%.

This fuel cycle aims to minimize processing requirements and proliferation risk while still being able to achieve exponential growth and high uranium utilization. The neutron excess concept is applied to compute the starting fuel requirements of new B&B reactors, allowing fleet doubling times to be estimated. A simple analytic expression for doubling time is derived, which is applied to example B&B reactors using a hypothetical core composition. It is found that larger reactors are able to achieve shorter doubling times because of their smaller starter fuel requirements per unit power. Several variant fuel cycle configurations are examined, and their doubling times are computed.

TECHNOLOGY AND POLICY ASPECTS OF DEEP BOREHOLE NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						nuclear waste disposal; deep boreholes; repository licensing		The use of deep boreholes for the disposal of high-level radioactive waste is reassessed, emphasizing key enabling technical features and their strong linkage to national and international fuel cycle policy. Emplacement 2 to 4 km deep in widely available granitic continental bedrock, under a 1-km caprock layer of high-integrity bedrock, is shown in this analysis to have the potential to provide sufficiently low host rock permeability to prevent radionuclide escape by transport in water-the only plausible release mechanism. The modular nature of the concept enables multiregion siting in large user countries and is especially well-suited for small-user nations. Irretrievability can be built-in to better meet safeguards objectives, and the exceptionally high assurance of confinement makes the disposal of minor actinides (and troublesome fission products) an attractive alternative to their destruction by transmutation.

DEVELOPMENT OF A U.S. NUCLEAR WASTE REPOSITORY RESEARCH PROGRAM IN SALT	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						salt repository; nuclear waste disposal; model-driven uncertainty reduction		With the United States rethinking its strategy for the management and disposal of defense high-level radioactive waste and civilian used nuclear fuel (UNF), it is an opportune time to evaluate the near-term and long-term options and requirements for the U.S. geologic repository program. In this paper, we outline a research program investigating the behavior of salt when subjected to thermal loads like those that would be present in a high-level-waste (HLW) repository. This program builds upon the knowledge base developed as a result of previous repository program efforts and the successful licensing and operation of the Waste Isolation Pilot Project Transuranic waste repository. We present a preliminary evaluation of a conceptual repository design that, in principle. exploits the positive attributes of salt as a disposal medium while balancing heat management issues against other considerations such as efficiency of disposal operations and cost. The coupled thermal-mechanical behavior of the intact and crushed salt, which influences and is influenced by the liberation and movement of water present in the salt and hydrous minerals, will ultimately control the thermal and hydrochemical conditions in the repository and at the waste package. To address key scientific issues, we advocate a combination of laboratory-scale investigations, a thermal test in the field for a configuration that replicates a small portion of our conceptual repository design, and numerical simulations conducted to develop a validated model that can be used for future repository design or performance assessment purposes. Accompanying this testing program would be a broader set of investigations that we advocate be conducted in the context of an iterative and adaptive process for systematically reducing uncertainties as we build a science-based safety case for HLW disposal in salt.

A NEW ANALYSIS OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS FOR USE IN GLOVE-BOX APPLICATIONS	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						composite materials; glove-box materials; radiation shielding	PROTECTION	Oil and natural gas companies use Am-241 sources for well-logging applications (in the form of americium-beryllium neutron sources). Currently, the domestic supply of Am-241 is depleted, and industry is now purchasing sources from Russia. The goal of the Americium Recovery Project (ARP) is to reprocess defense-waste plutonium to recover Am-241 that would then be sold to oil and gas companies, providing a safe, secure domestic source for industrial applications. Because the primary radiological concern with an Am-241 source is external photon exposure, the radiological workers involved in the ARP will perform operations in glove boxes featuring lead-lined gloves. Given the U.S. mandate for the reduction of lead in industrial settings and the costs associated with the disposal of leaded gloves as mixed waste, alternatives are being considered to the traditional lead-lined gloves used in glove boxes. Several composite materials were previously developed and analyzed for incident photons of energies below 400 keV using the Lambert-Beer law to calculate transmission fractions. This research extends the energy range to 10 MeV and uses a source term of interest to the ARP. Further, the Monte Carlo transport code MCNP5 is used to calculate source-normalized doses using two common response functions: H'(0.07) and H*(10). The results and calculations presented in this research are more detailed than previous calculations and present further rationale for the context-specific selection of a given material.

In this paper, the biokinetics of systemically administered soluble Co-60 have been examined. Male and female jugular-vein-catheterized (JVC) F344 rats received intravenous (IV) doses of 11.2 kBq of (CoCl2)-Co-60. The distribution of the radiocobalt was followed for 28 d with tissue sampling done at 1 and 4 h, and at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 28 d. Urine and feces were collected daily. Tissues and excreta were analyzed by gamma pulse height analysis. Within 8 d, 93% of the cobalt was eliminated from the body, primarily though urine. The highest tissue burdens were found in the liver, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and muscle shortly after administration. These tissues cleared quickly, so that by the conclusion of the 28-d study, less than 3% of the injected dose remained in the body. The results are comparable to published literature values for tissue content of 60Co and for excretion patterns up to 30 d after injection. These results will provide the data needed to construct a biokinetic model for the unperturbed biokinetics of 60Co in rats, which will subsequently be used to evaluate the impact of administered decorporating agents on organ radiation doses. The animal model described in this paper is representative of that used for other routes of radionuclide administration, such as inhalation, ingestion, and wound contamination, that have been studied at LBERI in support of the MCART and NIAID programs.

A conceptual spacecraft radioisotope thermoelectric and heating unit (RTHU)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH			English	Article						space; nuclear; radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG); radioisotope heater unit (RHU); radioisotope power system (RPS); nuclear battery		Spacecraft venturing to the outer planets and beyondor onto the planetary surface where available solar energy is reducedbenefit from the longevity and consistency of electrical and thermal energy derived from radioisotope energy sources. A review of likely mission requirements and concept studies of small electrical generating units (<10?We) reveals a potential opportunity for a unit with an electrical output of around 1?We that can also supply some heat to the spacecraft to aid thermal control: a radioisotope thermoelectric and heating unit. This power requirement cannot be achieved with current US space-qualified modular radioisotope fuel assemblies. Additionally, new European programmes consider 241Am fuel to be much more cost effective than 238Pu. Taken together, these factors provide the rationale for taking a relatively clean-sheet approach to design of a radioisotope thermoelectric and heating unit fuelled with 241Am. In this paper, initial requirements and performance targets for such a unit are developed, a simple concept design and thermal model is presented and the performance and mass are estimated. The results suggest that units generating 12?We may achieve a specific power of around 0.70.9?We?kg-1 without the thermal inputs to spacecraft becoming impractically large. Such units can use a bismuth telluride thermoelectric material, which is commercially applied in terrestrial applications and is therefore likely to incur lower cost and development risk than more specialised compounds. This study may form the basis of a more detailed design effort. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	[Williams, H. R.; Ambrosi, R. M.; Bannister, N.

The effect of contact time between the sorbent and aqueous solution, pH, initial concentration of uranium and temperature were also investigated. Kinetic studies show that uranium sorption onto amberlite CG-400 resin in the presence of phosphate is a fast process and follows pesudo-second-order kinetics. It was also found that the pH value and the presence of phosphate play very important roles in the uranium sorption onto CG-400 resin. Optimum pH for uranium sorption in the presence of phosphate anions was about 3.5. The experimental sorption isotherm is successfully described by Langmuir and Freundlich models. The maximum uranium sorption capacity was 57.14 and 112.36 mg g(-1) in the absence and presence of phosphate anion, respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Acir, A; Coskun, H				Acir, Adem; Coskun, Hasan			Neutronic analysis of the PBMR-400 full core using thorium fuel mixed with plutonium or minor actinides	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Monte Carlo; MONTEBURNS; ORIGEN2; Thorium; Reactor grade plutonium; Minor actinides	GRADE PLUTONIUM; REACTOR; TRANSMUTATION; INCINERATION; CRITICALITY	Time evolution of criticality and burnup grades of the PBMR were investigated for reactor grade plutonium and minor actinides in the spent fuel of light water reactors (LWRs) mixed with thoria. The calculations were performed by employing the computer codes MCNP and MONTEBURNS 2.0 and using the ENDF/B-V nuclear data library. Firstly, the plutonium-thorium and minor actinides-thorium ratio was determined by using the initial k(eff) value of the original uranium fuel design. After the selection of the plutonium/minor actinides-thorium mixture ratio, the time-dependent neutronic behavior of the reactor grade plutonium and minor actinides and original fuels in a PBMR-400 reactor was calculated by using the MCNP code. Finally, k(eff), burnup and operation time values of the fuels were compared. The core effective multiplication factor (k(eff)) for the original fuel which has 9.6 wt.% enriched uranium was computed as 1.2395. Corresponding to this k(eff) value the reactor grade plutonium/thorium and minor actinide/thorium oxide mixtures were found to be 30%/70% and 50%/50%, respectively. The core lives for the original, the reactor grade plutonium/thorium and the minor actinide/thorium fuels were calculated as similar to 3.2, similar to 6.5 and similar to 5.5 years, whereas, the corresponding burnups came out to be 99,000, similar to 190,000 and similar to 166,000 MWD/T, respectively, for an end of life k(eff) set equal to 1.02.
