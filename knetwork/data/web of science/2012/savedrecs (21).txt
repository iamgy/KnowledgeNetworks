J	Bilgin, A				Bilgin, Azra			Characterization and evaluation of the factors affecting the geochemistry of groundwater near a nuclear generating station in US	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article							SALINIZATION; RECHARGE; AQUIFER; CONTAMINATION; AGRICULTURE; FLUORIDE; QUALITY; NITRATE; TRITIUM; WATERS	Water quality monitoring data obtained from groundwater and wastewater facilities at the nuclear generating station in U.S. between 2003 and 2008 was evaluated to determine the impact wastewater facilities had on the ground water source. Most of the constituent concentrations were reported as non-detect or below the reporting limits of the method used. For the constituents for which exceedances were reported, geochemical data analysis tools were used to plot and determine changes in water quality at each location. Historical information and data were also gathered and compared to the recent data to determine the changes in the water chemistry (if any) since the nuclear station started its operations. Water quality in the wells down gradient of the wastewater facilities did not indicate any changes due to wastewater leaks. Graphical and statistical analyses and evaluation of peer-reviewed literature supported the conclusion that the exceedances were not caused by discharges from the nuclear facility, but were naturally occurring or caused by surrounding agricultural activity.

J	Ambos, F; Aminy, A; Gentes, S				Ambos, Frank; Aminy, Akramullah; Gentes, Sascha			Decontamination Processes for Pipes	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								Naturally occuring radioactive material (NORM) is solved and transported to the surface when oil and gas are extracted from their geological formations. This enables NORM to become soluble in the fluid and thus provides a way for NORM to be transported out of the formation. When liquid is transported from the underground through pipes temperature and pressure are changed and consequently NORM and other materials precipitate. The main share of radioactive contaminated pipes is found in relation with the extraction of oil and gas. In Germany there may be some hundred kilometers of contaminated pipes. However, this is only a very small percentage of used and contaminated pipes worldwide. Previously used technologies for pipe decontamination are based on spraying techniques. A successful decontamination with these techniques is only possible with great efforts. Additionally the used materials for spraying e.g. water and/or abrasive materials secondary waste is produced. It is necessary to process these materials after use for decontamination. A project was initiated and supported by the Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (Federal Ministry of Education and Research) to qualify a new technology for the decontamiantion of such pipes. The project was carried out by sat. Kerntechnik GmbH. The challenge was an efficient and naturally friendly technology without the production of secondary waste.

J	Vayssier, G				Vayssier, George			PRESENT DAY EOPS AND SAMG - WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Post-Fukushima; Extended Design Basis Accidents; Extended SAMG Technical Basis; BDBA Safety Classification; Outside Emergency Support		The Fukushima-Daiichi accident shook the world, as a well-known plant design, the General Electric BWR Mark I, was heavily damaged in the tsunami, which followed the Great Japanese Earthquake of 11 March 2011. Plant safety functions were lost and, as both AC and DC failed, manoeuvrability of the plants at the site virtually came to a full stop. The traditional system of Emergency Operating Procedures (EOPs) and Severe Accident Management Guidelines (SAMG) failed to protect core and containment, and severe core damage resulted, followed by devastating hydrogen explosions and, finally, considerable radioactive releases. The root cause may not only have been that the design against tsunamis was incorrect, but that the defence against accidents in most power plants is based on traditional assumptions, such as Large Break LOCA as the limiting event, whereas there is no engineered design against severe accidents in most plants. Accidents beyond the licensed design basis have hardly been considered in the various designs, and if they were included, they often were not classified for their safety role, as most system safety classifications considered only design basis accidents. It is, hence, time to again consider the Design Basis Accident, and ask ourselves whether the time has not come to consider engineered safety functions to mitigate core damage accidents. Associated is a proper classification of those systems that do the job. Also associated are safety criteria, which so far are only related to 'public health and safety', in reality, nuclear accidents cause few casualties, but create immense economical and societal effects - for which there are no criteria to be met. Severe accidents create an environment far surpassing the imagination of those who developed EOPs and SAMG, most of which was developed after Three Mile Island - an accident where all was still in place, except the insight in the event was lost. It requires fundamental changes in our present safety approach and safety thinking and, hence, also in our EOPs and SAMG, in order to prevent future 'Fukushimas'.

J	Kwon, TJ; Kim, JK				Kwon, Tae Je; Kim, Jong Kyung			APPLICATION OF A GENETIC ALGORITHM FOR THE OPTIMIZATION OF ENRICHMENT ZONING AND GADOLINIA FUEL (UO2/Gd2O3) ROD DESIGNS IN OPR1000s	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Enrichment Zoning; Gadolinia; Genetic Algorithm; Optimization; PLUS7; Power Peaking		A new effective methodology for optimizing the enrichment of low-enriched zones as well as gadolinia fuel (UO2/Gd2O3) rod designs in PLUS7 fuel assemblies was developed to minimize the maximum peak power ill the core and to maximize the cycle lifetime. An automated link code was developed to integrate the genetic algorithm (GA) and the core design code package of ALPHA/PHOENIX-P/ANC and to generate and evaluate the candidates to be optimized efficiently through the integrated code package. This study introduces an optimization technique for the optimization of gadolinia fuel rod designs in order to effectively reduce the peak powers for a few hot assemblies simultaneously during the cycle. Coupled with the gadolinia optimization, the optimum enrichments were determined using the same automated code package. Applying this technique to the reference core of Ulchin Unit 4 Cycle 11, the gadolinia fuel rods in each hot assembly were optimized to different numbers and positions from their original designs, and the maximum peak power was decreased by 2.5%, while the independent optimization technique showed a decrease of 1.6% for the same fuel assembly. The lower enrichments at the fuel rods adjacent to the corner gap (CG), guide tube (GT), and instrumentation tube (IT) were optimized from the current 4.1, 4.1, 4.1 w/o to 4.65, 4.2, 4.2 w/o. The increase in the cycle lifetime achieved through this methodology was 5 effective full-power days (EFPD) on an ideal equilibrium cycle basis while keeping the peak power as low as 2.3% compared with the original design.

The containment pressure suppression chamber (S/C) should have failed until the noon on 12 March 2011 only by seismic load due to the huge earthquake on 11 March or by combination of seismic deterioration and dynamic load due to steam flowing-in through safety relief valve. Opening of the two safety relief valves (SRVs) at 14 March 21:18 should have resulted in discharge of large amount of radioactive materials through the S/C breach with the measured air dose rate peak value of 3.130E-3Sv/h at 21:37 near the main gate of the site. The containment drywell (D/W) should have failed at 15 March 06:25, at the cable penetration seal due to high temperature caused by the fuel materials heating up on the floor of the D/W, which had flowed out from the reactor pressure vessel. Then large amount of radioactive materials should have been discharged through the D/W breach with the measured air dose rate peak value of 1.193E-2Sv/h at 15 March 9:00.

Highly porous silica beads, the inner pores of which were embedded with a benzo-18-crown-6 ether resin or a benzo-15-crown-5 ether resin, were used as column packing material. For both the resins, enrichment of heavier isotopes of calcium was observed in the frontal part of their respective calcium chromatograms. The values of the isotope fractionation coefficient were on the order of 10(-3) and 10(-4) for the benzo-18-crown-6 ether and benzo-15-crown-5 ether resins, respectively. The observed isotope fractionation coefficient was dependent on the concentration of hydrochloric acid in the calcium feed solution; a higher hydrochloric acid concentration resulted in a smaller fractionation coefficient value. The present calcium isotope effects were most probably mass dependent, indicating they came from isotope effects based on molecular vibration. Molecular orbital calculations supported the present experimental results in a qualitative fashion.

Measurements of soil radon in south Russia for seismological application: Methodological aspects	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article						Variation of radon; Soil; Counter; Measurements; Methods; Earthquakes; Predict	SSNTDS	As a first step in the monitoring of soil radon in search of harbingers of earthquakes, an investigation of suitable measurement techniques was conducted. As a result of these investigations, the following recommendations are made. Semiconductor and scintillation (ZnS) counters are the most suitable for Rn monitoring with chambers for natural drift of emanations to the detector. The method of compulsory selection of soil air is hardly effective. Soil aerosols might enter the drift chamber; these aerosols transfer many radioactive isotopes. The most suitable locations for placement of detectors of radon are cellars. Measurements should be continuous in character. The choice of a place for monitoring near mud volcanoes and faults should be determined by an Rn survey. In mud volcanoes, the best locations are areas with an average concentration of radon. For faults, identical tendencies of change in radon are maintained at some distance from the borders of the fault. For large faults, this distance is equal to half the width of the fault. For small faults, this distance increases by up to 3 times the fault width. All the recommendations were applied in the Northern Caucasus. Reliable results of the changes in soil radon were obtained during strong geophysical processes. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Numerical modelling of the activity concentration measurements of beta-radioactive noble gases by absorption in polycarbonates and external beta-counting	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article						Kr-85; Rn-222; Polycarbonates; Absorption; Beta-counting; Monte Carlo	RADON; RN-222; WATER; MAKROFOL; MONITOR; AIR	This work presents a unified numerical model for detailed description of the measurement of activity concentrations of radioactive noble gases by absorption in polycarbonates and external beta-counting. The model combines the numerical description of the kinetics of sorption and desorption processes with Monte Carlo simulations and calculates the measurement efficiency. The numerical model is compared to experimental data for Kr-85 and Rn-222 and a very good agreement is found. The numerical and experimental results show that for plate polycarbonates the measurement efficiency depends on the sorption and desorption times. In the case of Kr-85 measurements the numerical modelling shows that this dependence is pronounced for thick polycarbonates and short exposure durations. For large exposure times Kr-85 concentration inside the polycarbonate reaches homogeneous distribution, hence the efficiency of the system stays constant with time. In the case of Rn-222 measurements no homogeneous activity distribution inside the polycarbonate can be reached due to the short half-life of Rn-222. The measurement efficiency in the case of Rn-222 depends slightly on the desorption time. It is also demonstrated that in the case of Rn-222 the measurement efficiency could be influenced by registration of the alpha-particles of Rn-222 and its progeny. This influence increases the time dependence of the efficiency on the sorption and desorption times. Therefore, this effect must always be checked for and taken into account if an accurate measurement result is necessary. The developed numerical model allows to optimize the measurements by choosing appropriate experimental conditions in terms of polycarbonate thickness and sorption and desorption times. Results from several scenarios are presented, which allow the experimenter to chose a priori the optimal exposure and measurement conditions. Finally, we present results from pilot experiments on slowing down the desorption of the radioactive noble gases from the polycarbonates. We demonstrate that cooling the exposed polycarbonates to liquid nitrogen temperature practically stops the desorption of Rn-222 from the polycarbonate specimen. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Disaggregating measurement uncertainty from population variability and Bayesian treatment of uncensored results	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							ATOMIC-BOMB SURVIVOR; MEASUREMENT ERROR; LIKELIHOOD FUNCTIONS; LUNG-CANCER; EXPOSURE; DOSIMETRY; LEVEL; POWER	In making low-level radioactivity measurements of populations, it is commonly observed that a substantial portion of net results is negative. Furthermore, the observed variance of the measurement results arises from a combination of measurement uncertainty and population variability. This paper presents a method for disaggregating measurement uncertainty from population variability to produce a probability density function (PDF) of possibly true results. To do this, simple, justifiable and reasonable assumptions are made about the relationship of the measurements to the measurands (the otrue values'). The measurements are assumed to be unbiased, that is, that their average value is the average of the measurands. Using traditional estimates of each measurements uncertainty, a likelihood PDF for each individuals measurand is produced. Then using the same assumptions and all the data from the population of individuals, a prior PDF of measurands for the population is produced. The prior PDF is non-negative, and the average is equal to the average of the measurement results for the population. Using Bayess theorem, posterior PDFs of each individual measurand are calculated. The uncertainty in these Bayesian posterior PDFs appears to be all Berkson with no remaining classical component. The method is applied to baseline bioassay data from the Hanford site. The data include Sr-90 urinalysis measurements of 128 people, Cs-137 in vivo measurements of 5337 people and Pu-239 urinalysis measurements of 3270 people. The method produces excellent results for the Sr-90 and Cs-137 measurements, since there are non-zero concentrations of these global fallout radionuclides in people who have not been occupationally exposed. The method does not work for the Pu-239 measurements in non-occupationally exposed people because the population average is essentially zero relative to the sensitivity of the measurement technique. The method is shown to give results similar to classical statistical inference when the measurements have relatively small uncertainty.

Scavenging ratio was found to vary from 0.06 to 1.04 with a mean of 0.46. The wet deposition velocity of tritium observed in the present study was in the range of 3.3E03 to 1.1E02 m s(1) with a mean of 6.6E03 m s(1). The ratio of specific activity of tritium in soil moisture to that in air moisture ranged from 0.17 to 0.95 with a mean of 0.49. The specific activity of tritium in plant water in this study varied from 73 to 310 Bq l(1). The present study is very useful for understanding the process and modelling of transfer of tritium through air/soil/plant system at the Kaiga site.	[Ravi, P. M.; Hegde, A. G.; Sarkar, P.

Natural radioactivity in granite stones used as building materials in Iran	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								Due to increasing concern about environmental radiological protection, specific radioactivity concentrations of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 in different types of commonly used granite stone samples collected from the Tehran city of Iran have been determined by means of a high-resolution HPGe gamma-spectroscopy system. The activity concentrations of Th-232, Ra-226 and K-40 in the selected granite samples ranged from 18 to 178, 6 to 160 and 556 to 1539 Bq kg(1), respectively. The radium equivalent activities (Ra-eq) are lower than the limit of 370 Bq kg(1) set by NEA-OECD [Nuclear Energy Agency. Exposure to radiation from natural radioactivity in building materials. Report by NEA Group of Experts. OECD (1979)], except in two samples. The internal hazard indexes have been found well below the acceptable limit in most of the samples. Five samples of investigated commercial granite stones do not satisfy the safety criterion illustrated by UNSCEAR (United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation. Exposure from natural sources of radiation. Report to the General Assembly (1993). Applying dose criteria recently recommended by the EC [European Commission Report on Radiological Protection Principles Concerning the Natural Radioactivity of Building Materials.

Transfer factor of the radionuclides in food crops from high-background radiation area of south west India	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							NATURAL RADIONUCLIDES; SOIL; RADIOACTIVITY; PLANT; URANIUM; ELEMENTS; FIELD	It is necessary to obtain the transfer factor (TF) of long-lived radionuclides because soil type and vegetation can affect TF. We studied the food crops commonly consumed by the general public of Kanyakumari district of south India. The main focus was on rice, fruits, vegetables and tapioca because the consumption of these is high. The soil to rice TF for the radionuclides, Ra-226, Th-232, U-238 and (40) K are 8.810(2), 14.210(2), 5.810(2) and 6.310(2), respectively. The TF of tapioca for Ra-226, Th-232, U-238 and (40) K are 6.210(2) , 1110(2), 1.910(2) and 8.910(2), respectively. For fruits and vegetables, the TFs are low. In the majority of the crops the non-edible parts accumulate more radionuclides than the edible parts.	[Shanthi, G.] Womens Christian Coll, Dept Phys, Nagercoil 629001, India; [Kumaran, J.

Measurements of Rn-222 activity concentration in domestic water sources in Penang, northern peninsular Malaysia	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							DRINKING-WATER; RADON; RADIOACTIVITY	Measurements of Rn-222 activity concentration were carried out in 39 samples collected from the domestic and drinking water sources used in the island and mainland of Penang, northern peninsular, Malaysia. The measured activity concentrations ranged from 7.49 to 26.25 Bq l(1), 0.49 to 9.72 Bq l(1) and 0.58 to 2.54 Bq l(1) in the raw, treated and bottled water samples collected, respectively. This indicated relatively high radon concentrations compared with that from other parts of the world, which still falls below the WHO recommended treatment level of 100 Bq l(1). From this data, the age-dependent associated committed effective doses due to the ingestion of Rn-222 as a consequence of direct consumption of drinking water were calculated. The committed effective doses from Rn-222 resulting from 1 ys consumption of these water were estimated to range from 0.003 to 0.048, 0.001 to 0.018 and 0.002 to 0.023 mSv y(1), for age groups 01, 216 and 16 y, respectively.

Measurements were conducted with both sensor and radioisotope sources placed in a vacuum and cooled to 78 K. The results are consistent with the previous theory of Shockley for the e-h PCE in semiconductors. The measured PCE using three particle types over a large range of energies yield self consistent values for the PCE. For MCT with a 2.63 micron cutoff, a PCE of 2.4 eV is determined.

Three casks with size proportion of 1:1, 1:1/2.5, and 1:1/5 are respectively simulated to explore the size effect in small scale drop tests. The analysis is carried out by fully 3-D simulation following the procedures of explicit finite element. The commercial code, LS-DYNA is employed to treat the strong nonlinear phenomena, such as the geometric, material and contact/impact nonlinearities. In addition, a technique for quickly determining the adequate cut-off frequency in post-process of acceleration response curve is proposed. The height of the vertical drop event is 61 cm, which is adopted in accordance with the operation procedures designed for a nuclear power plant in Taiwan. The scenarios of 0 degrees straight impact and 5 degrees oblique impact are both investigated. The discrepancies in the straight and oblique impacts and in the three diverse size scales are reported and discussed. It is shown that to predict the response of 1:1 prototype only using small scale test is nearly impossible. Numerical simulation is a must to help predict the response of 1:1 prototype.

In this study, the performance of a hybrid modeling combined with the industrial source complex (ISC) model and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for predicting tracer concentrations was investigated. Tracer dispersion experiments were performed to produce the field data assuming the accidental release of radioactive material. ANFIS was trained in order that the outputs of the ISC model are similar to the measured data. Judging from the higher correlation coefficients between the measured and the calculated ones, the hybrid modeling approach could be an appropriate technique for an improvement of the modeling capability to predict the air concentrations for radioactive materials.

J	Ahmad, A; Parks, GT				Ahmad, Ali; Parks, Geoffrey T.			The mechanical integrity of fuel pin cladding in a pulsed-beam accelerator driven subcritical reactor	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Accelerator driven subcritical reactor; Fixed field alternating gradient accelerator; Pulsed-beam operation; Thermal cyclic fatigue; Fuel pin cladding integrity	SYSTEMS; STEEL; ADS	The Accelerator Driven Subcritical Reactor (ADSR) is one of the reactor designs proposed for future nuclear energy production. Interest in the ADSR arises from its enhanced and intrinsic safety characteristics, as well as its potential ability to utilize the large global reserves of thorium and to burn legacy actinide waste from other reactors and decommissioned nuclear weapons. The ADSR concept is based on the coupling of a particle accelerator and a subcritical core by means of a neutron spallation target interface. One of the candidate accelerator technologies receiving increasing attention, the Fixed Field Alternating Gradient (FFAG) accelerator, generates a pulsed proton beam. This paper investigates the impact of pulsed proton beam operation on the mechanical integrity of the fuel pin cladding. A pulsed beam induces repetitive temperature changes in the reactor core which lead to cyclic thermal stresses in the cladding. To perform the thermal analysis aspects of this study a code that couples the neutron kinetics of a subcritical core to a cylindrical geometry heat transfer model was developed. This code, named PTS-ADS, enables temperature variations in the cladding to be calculated. These results are then used to perform thermal fatigue analysis and to predict the stress-life behaviour of the cladding. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mathematical modeling and measurement of the activated corrosion products in the MNSR research reactor	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Al-alloy; Corrosion products; Modeling; MNSR reactor	ALUMINUM	The corrosion product activities of Na-24 and Mg-27 have been experimentally measured as a function of the MNSR reactor operation time. The Na-24 corrosion product contribution is much more than the Mg activity in the MNSR reactor coolant and its activity increased with the reactor operation time. The activity of the Mg-27 corrosion product reaches its saturation state in about 2 h after the start of the MNSR reactor operation. The mean neutron flux and cross sections for the interactions of Al-27 with neutrons in the MNSR reactor have been numerically calculated using MCNP-4C code. A simple mathematical model for the simulation of the coolant activation due to the corrosion products in the MNSR reactor has been proposed. This model has been based on considering the balance between the rate of radioactive nuclei production and their radioactive decays. The calculated Na-24 and Mg-27 corrosion products activities values are in a good agreement with the corresponding experimental measured values. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The tritium concentrations in the temporary storage for both after tritium removal (T-removal) and without T-removal cases are estimated with respect to the capacity of ADS and VDS to find the influence of the tritium removal process. And also a numerical model for estimating tritium behavior in the concrete wall in the temporary storage is developed by using a one-dimensional diffusion model and tritium concentration model. The tritium permeated depths in the wall under the worst conditions are estimated for both after T-removal and without T-removal, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The calculations are performed with the Monte Carlo computer code MCNP. Differences of similar to 600 pcm in k(eff) are observed for the benchmark model of the TRIGA reactor, while there are practically no differences in the k(inf) of the fuel. Therefore, an investigation is performed also for hypothetical homogeneous and heterogeneous systems with different leakage. The uncertainty analysis shows that the most important contributors to the difference in k(eff) are the Zr isotopes (especially Zr-90 and Zr-91) and thermal scattering data for H and Zr in ZrH. As the differences in k(eff) due to the use of different cross section libraries are relatively large, there is certainly a need for a review of the evaluated cross section data of the zirconium isotopes.

A novel method for rapid comparative quantitative analysis of nuclear fuel cycles	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Fuel cycle; Optimisation; Reactor model; Fast reactors; Thermal reactors	REACTORS; OPTIONS	One of the greatest obstacles facing the nuclear industry is that of sustainability, both in terms of the finite reserves of uranium ore and the production of highly radiotoxic spent fuel which presents proliferation and environmental hazards. Alternative nuclear technologies have been suggested as a means of delivering enhanced sustainability with proposals including fast reactors, the use of thorium fuel and tiered fuel cycles. The debate as to which is the most appropriate technology continues, with each fuel system and reactor type delivering specific advantages and disadvantages which can be difficult to compare fairly. This paper demonstrates a framework of performance metrics which, coupled with a first-order lumped reactor model to determine nuclide population balances, can be used to quantify the aforementioned pros and cons for a range of different fuel and reactor combinations. The framework includes metrics such as fuel efficiency, spent fuel toxicity and proliferation resistance, and relative cycle performance is analysed through parallel coordinate plots, yielding a quantitative comparison of disparate cycles.

In the current study, optimization and neutronic design calculations have been carried out for an LEU homogeneous aqueous solution reactor with uranyl nitrate as a solution fuel. Lattice calculations and core modeling was performed employing available standard nuclear reactor codes WIMSD and CITATION. Calculation procedure was verified using experimental published data and simulated criticality results were compared with the published data. After verification of the calculation methodology, optimization and design calculations were performed for four different uranium enrichments (5%, 10%, 15%, and 19.99%) of the uranyl nitrate solution. Keeping in view the restraints on peak power density of solution reactors, annular geometry is suited as compared to the cylindrical geometry. Among the four considered enrichments in the analysis, 19.99% enriched uranyl nitrate solution with annular geometry presents optimum design parameters for the homogeneous aqueous solution reactor.

Point defect formation and migration in Ga stabilised delta-Pu	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							MINIMUM ENERGY PATHS; ELASTIC BAND METHOD; SADDLE-POINTS; PLUTONIUM; SIMULATIONS; ALLOYS; POTENTIALS; CASCADES; GALLIUM	The energetics of point defects in Ga stabilised delta-Pu are investigated through calculations of formation energies, migration pathways and through on-the-fly kinetic Monte Carlo (OTF-KMC) calculations. Using the Modified Embedded Atom Method as the interatomic potential, defect formation energies are found to depend greatly on both the specie of the defect and the surrounding local environment. Ga vacancies are found to have considerably larger formation energies than Pu vacancies, due to the change in the nearest neighbour Pu-Ga ordering. Point vacancy and point interstitial migration involving Ga atoms or Pu atoms in regions close to substitutional Ga, results in much higher energy barriers than for migration in pure Pu. OTF-KMC calculations show that this leads to defect migration pathways confined to areas of high Pu concentration, with the degree of confinement dependent on the location and ordering of the substitutional Ga. Vacancy migration takes place only through displacing Pu atoms and split Ga interstitials become almost instantaneously substitutional, displacing a Pu atom. The results indicate that the presence of Ga within the Pu matrix has a significant effect on the recovery of point defects. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Robinson, M.; Kenny, S.

Effects of deuterium implantation and subsequent electron irradiation on the microstructure of Fe-10Cr model alloy	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							HELIUM; STEEL; HYDROGEN; METALS; DEFECT; IRON	The interactions between deuterium atoms and irradiation defects in materials are important for designing materials in fusion reactors due to the fact that deuterium widely exists in nuclear reactions, and that the interactions provide a means to study the dynamic behavior of the isotopes of hydrogen in the material based on the isotope effects. In the current paper, the effects of deuterium implantation and the subsequent electron irradiation on the microstructure of Fe-10 wt%Cr model alloy have been investigated using ultra-high voltage transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The in situ observation showed that the size of dislocation loops increases with increasing electron irradiation dose and irradiation temperature. No distinct voids were observed at irradiation temperature up to 823 K. The migration energy (E-m) of deuterium-vacancy complex was calculated from the growth speed of dislocation loops at 623-773 K. A high-resolution TEM image of dislocation loops because of deuterium ion implantation was also achieved. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Liu, P. P.; Bai, J. W.; Ke, D.; Wan, F.

Investigation of iron long-term corrosion mechanisms in anoxic media using deuterium tracing	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							ARCHAEOLOGICAL ARTIFACTS; CARBON-STEEL; CROSS-SECTION; PASSIVE FILM; IN-SITU; ENVIRONMENT; BEHAVIOR; PRODUCT; SOIL	In the context of the nuclear waste storage and the preservation of metallic artefacts, the long-term corrosion of iron is studied. In an anoxic medium, the cathodic process involves the reduction. of water into gaseous hydrogen and hydrogen-containing species that can precipitate with iron((II)). Consequently, to understand the corrosion mechanisms, isotopic deuterium tracing (D2O) has been performed on archaeological artefacts to locate the precipitation zones in the corrosion layer. The presence of deuterium in the metallic matrix of the sample indicates that gaseous hydrogen has been formed and is a clue of the water reduction reaction. Moreover, the precipitation zones in the corrosion layer have been identified on its internal part. This is caused by the iron source location on this part of the corrosion layer. Deuterium concentration quantification made it possible to evaluate an instantaneous corrosion rate below 2 mu m/year. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

High temperature chromium volatilization from Cr2O3 powder and Cr2O3-doped UO2 pellets in reducing atmospheres	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							PHASE-DIAGRAMS; CR-O; SYSTEMS	Chromium volatilization from Cr0O3 powder and Cr2O3-doped UO2 pellets during sintering in reducing atmospheres has been studied by thermogravimetry (TG) coupled with differential thermal analysis (DTA) up to 1700 degrees C. The sintering of Cr2O3-doped UO2 pellets was also followed by dilatometry. Oxygen partial pressures in the range 10(-20)-10(-11) atm (10(-15)-10(-6) Pa) have been fixed ill all the experiments thanks to mixtures of hydrogen and carbon dioxide. A linear heating rate of 20 degrees C min(-1) was applied to all the experiments. The dopant amount was in the range 0.18-0.9 mol% Cr in UO2. For all the oxygen potentials, the mass loss of Cr2O3 powder was found to start at temperatures as high as 1470 degrees C due to Cr2O3 dissociation, the lower the oxygen potential, the lower the starting temperature and the higher the volatilized amount. For intermediate oxygen potentials, an exothermic DTA peak observed during cooling, from 1700 degrees C to room temperature, attested for the crystallization of a liquid phase which was attributed to CrO(I) according to thermodynamic predictions. Then, the dilatometry and TG studies allowed following the behavior of Cr2O3-doped UO2 pellets. The mass loss at temperatures higher than 1470 C was attributed to chromium volatilization for all the doped samples. During the sintering of doped UO2 pellets, the liquid phase CrO(I) seemed to appear at a lower oxygen potential than in Cr2O3 powder, which probably contributed to enhance the densification rate. For the highest dopant amount, 0.9 mol% Cr, the volatilization process was found to be rather similar to that of Cr2O3 powder, due to the part of chromia not solubilized in the UO2 crystal. Moreover, as the initial pellets were not dense, as long as the pellet porosity remained open, the chromia particles were able to dissociate as in the Cr2O3 powder. Thus the volatilization of chromium from doped UO2 pellets under sintering in reducing atmospheres must be understood as the result of several phenomena whose contribution depends on temperature, oxygen potential and heating rate: before the porosity closure, both dissociation of chromia into Cr(g) and oxygen from excess Cr2O3 particles, and Cr volatilization from doped UO2 particles: then chromium volatilization from the doped UO2 ceramic during further densification process.

Multidimensional multiphysics simulation of nuclear fuel behavior	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							FRAMEWORK; CREEP; UO2	Nuclear fuel operates in an environment that induces complex multiphysics phenomena, occurring over distances ranging from inter-atomic spacing to meters, and times scales ranging from microseconds to years. This multiphysics behavior is often tightly coupled and many important aspects are inherently multidimensional. Most current fuel modeling codes employ loose multiphysics coupling and are restricted to 2D axisymmetric or 1.5D approximations. This paper describes a new modeling tool able to simulate coupled multiphysics and multiscale fuel behavior, for either 2D axisymmetric or 3D geometries. Specific fuel analysis capabilities currently implemented in this tool are described., followed by a set of demonstration problems which include a 10-pellet light water reactor fuel rodlet, three-dimensional analysis of pellet clad mechanical interaction in the vicinity of a defective fuel pellet, coupled heat transfer and fission product diffusion in a TRISO-coated fuel particle, a demonstration of the ability to couple to lower-length scale models to account for material property variation with microstructural evolution, and a demonstration of the tool's ability to efficiently solve very large and complex problems using massively-parallel computing. A final section describes an early validation exercise, comparing simulation results to a light water reactor fuel rod experiment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Williamson, R.

This technique was developed to identify failures occurred during the fabrication process. It is based on a smart image analysis technique for automatic identification of the failures on uranium oxide pellets used as fuel in PWR nuclear power stations. In order to achieve this goal, an artificial neural network (ANN) has been trained and validated from image histograms of pellets containing examples not only from normal pellets (flawless), but from defective pellets as well (with the main flaws normally found during the manufacturing process). Based on this technique, a new automatic identification system of flaws on nuclear fuel element pellets, composed by the association of image pre-processing and intelligent, will be developed and implemented on the Brazilian nuclear fuel production industry. Based on the theoretical performance of the technology proposed and presented in this article, it is believed that this new system, NuFAS (Nuclear Fuel Pellets Failures Automatic Identification Neural System) will be able to identify structural failures in nuclear fuel pellets with virtually zero error margins. After implemented, the NuFAS will add value to control quality process of the national production of the nuclear fuel. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

FUEL COMPOSITION STABILIZATION IN A SUBCRITICAL LIQUID-SALT TRANSPLUTONIUM BURNER REACTOR	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								Possible replenishment schemes ensuring the attainment and maintenance of an equilibrium fuel composition are studied for a subcritical liquid-salt transplutonium burner reactor now under development. The computational model describes fuel burnup in a two-component approximation singling out the transplutonium actinides and the remaining actinide fractions consisting mainly of plutonium. The analysis is limited to instantaneous replenishment control, directly proportional to the criticality and/or fuel composition unbalance. The case of small fuel composition unbalance, allowing linearization of the burnup equations, and the general case where Lyapunov functions are used for stability analysis are studied. It is shown that criticality unbalance control using the transplutonium actinide fraction does not secure fuel-composition stability. Control using the plutonium fraction does secure stability.

SAFETY PROPERTIES OF BN-1200 WITH MIXED OXIDE AND NITRIDE FUEL: A COMPARISON	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								Along with mixed oxide fuel, the possibility of using in BN-1200 dense nitride fuel, making it possible to attain higher technical-economic performance, is also studied. However, safety analysis will determine the choice of fuel type. In this connection, it is important to perform a comparative analysis of the inherent safety properties for variants of the BN-1200 core with mixed uranium-plutonium and nitride fuel for the most serious unanticipated loss-of-power accident with failure of all emergency protection organs of the reactor simultaneously. A two-dimensional version of the COREMELT computer code was used in the calculations. The computational analysis showed that the inherent safety of BN-1200 is much greater with nitride than with mixed uranium-plutonium fuel.	[Volkov, A. V.; Ashurko, Yu. M.; Kuznetsov, I.

Gamma-ray spectrometry was used to determine Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 contents in pulverised coal, bottom ash and fly ash samples. The natural radionuclide concentrations in pulverised coal ranged from 29 to 61 Bq kg(1) for Ra-226, from 32 to 55 Bq kg(1) for Th-232 and from 229 to 414 Bq kg(1) for K-40. The fly ash fraction gave concentrations ranging from 80 to 98 Bq kg(1) for Ra-226, from 64 to 85 Bq kg(1) for Th and from 754 to 992 Bq kg(1) for K-40, respectively. The enrichment factors from coal to fly ashes are 1.7, 2.24 and 2.6 for Th-232, Ra-226 and K-40, respectively. Therefore, it is advisable to monitor the environmental impact of the power plant.

There is general agreement between these new activity measurements and the specific activities derived from previously calculated dose values on the one hand and former measurements of samples gathered at distances less than 1,000 m from the center of the explosion (G 1,000 m slant range) on the other. It was found that activities at long range (9 1,300 m slant range) were mainly cosmogenically induced. Furthermore, at long range, these results are in disagreement with older measurements whose specific activity values were 10 to 100 times higher than predicted by computer model calculations in DS86 and DS02. As a consequence, the previously reported discrepancy is not confirmed.

ESTIMATION OF HIGH-LEVEL, RAPIDLY-CHANGING CONCENTRATIONS USING MOVING-FILTER CONTINUOUS PARTICULATE AIR MONITORS	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						accidents; power reactor; monitoring, air; calibration; monitors; radiation; decay chain		A previously published mathematical model for the dynamic response of moving-filter continuous particulate air monitors has been enhanced to extend that model to include decay chains. During this work, it was observed that a quantitative relationship appeared to exist between the monitor count rate and the time-dependent particulate airborne radioactive material concentration if, and only if, the filter (tape) speed was much faster than the nominal 2.54 cm h (1) (1 in h (1)). The extended model demonstrated that operating moving-filter monitors at this nominal filter speed does not provide a quantitative measurement of a changing airborne particulate concentration of a fission product or other contaminant. By contrast, at faster filter speeds [e.g., 76.2 or 152.4 cm h (1) (30 or 60 in h (1))], numerical experimentation with this model showed that the count rate trace has essentially the same shape as the concentration profile. It was then found that a quantitative relationship applies, but only when the filter speed is sufficiently fast so that a Taylor series expansion of the monitor count rate can be reasonably well truncated at the first-order term. This mode of operation, which does not require any new monitor hardware, is capable of tracking rapidly changing concentrations. Since the fast filter speed also reduces the monitor's count rate, all else being equal, the approach will best be used for relatively high-level concentrations, such as may occur in abnormal or "accident" conditions. The count rate suppression may also be useful for reducing the detector saturation that can occur with higher levels of airborne particulate radioactivity in post-accident situations.

Airborne radioactive material was detected in metropolitan areas near Tokyo, and increases in radiation dose rate were observed at many locations. In this study, repeated measurements with the in situ Ge system were performed in Chiba City, which is about 220 km south of Fukushima. Increases in radiation dose rate were recorded on 15, 16, and 21 March, with a maximum of 0.5 mu Gy h(-1). This level is clearly higher than natural background in Japan. Airborne Mo-99, (99)mTc, (129)mTe, Te-129, Te-132, I-131, I-132, I-133, Xe-133, (133)mXe, Xe-135, Cs-134, Cs-136, Cs-137, and La-140 were detected. Environmental radioactive contamination in the metropolitan area occurred mainly on 21 March by rainfall. The initial rates of decrease in radiation dose rate generally reflected radiological decay according to their physical (radiological) half-lives. However, the in situ half-lives of the long-lived radionuclides such as Cs-134 and Cs-137 reflected environmental dispersal rather than radiological decay.

The workers were employed at various facilities throughout the United States, including the Department of Energy defense facilities and uranium mining and milling sites. The majority of individuals were involved in documented radiological incidents during their careers. All had voluntarily agreed to donate their organs or whole body to the United States Transuranium and Uranium Registries. External and internal dose assessments were performed using occupational exposure histories and postmortem concentrations of transuranic radionuclides in critical organs. Statistical data analyses were performed to investigate the potential relationship between radiation exposure and causes of death within this population due to cancers of the lungs, liver, and all sites combined while controlling for the effects of other confounders. No association was found between radiation exposure and death due to cancer (alpha = 0.05). However, statistically significant associations were found between death due to any type of cancer and smoking (yes or no) (odds ratio = 5.41; 95% CI: 1.42 to 20.67) and rate of cigarette smoking (packs per day) (odds ratio = 2.70; 95% CI: 1.37 to 5.30).

Although the associated direct contact finger doses are typically small, it is suggested (and in line with the principle of ALARA) to handle these tubes from the cap of the tube. When containing radioactive material, handling a tube near the bottom conical section would unnecessarily increase the skin dose to the fingers. This investigation modeled a 2.0-mL Eppendorf tube containing various individual beta emitting isotopes commonly used in a biomedical research environment (i.e., C-14, H-3, I-131, P-32, and S-35) to determine the skin dose when directly handling the tube at the cap end and when handling it at the bottom conical section. The primary goal of this paper is to assess how significantly this dose is altered by handling geometry. The skin dose to a single finger was calculated with Monte Carlo simulations using MCNP5 and determined at a depth of 0.007 cmin water averaged over 10 cm(2) as described in 10CFR20. Results show that the dose rate may vary by as much as a factor of 700 depending on handling geometry.

J	Hu, TA				Hu, T. Albert			IMPROVED MODEL FOR HYDROGEN GENERATION RATE OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE AT THE HANFORD SITE	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						hydrogen generation; radioactive waste; water radiolysis	WATER	Hydrogen is the major flammable gas observed in the dome space of each million-gallon radioactive waste storage tank at the U.S. Department of Energy Hanford Site. Semiempirical rate equations are derived to estimate hydrogen generation based on chemical reactions, radiolysis of water and organic compounds, and corrosion. The rate equations account for tank waste composition, temperature, radiation dose rate, and liquid fraction. Numerical parameters are established by the analysis of gas generation kinetic data from actual waste samples, literature data, and waste characterization and field surveillance data. The model improvement includes development of refined water radiolysis equations, accounting of total alpha radiation contribution to both water and organic radiolysis, new parameterization on the rate equations of organic thermolysis and radiolysis with extra tank waste gas generation test data, and revised corrosion rate equations. A comparison of the generation rates observed in the field with the rates calculated for 28 tanks shows agreement within a factor of 3. The model serves as a useful tool to evaluate flammable gas issues to support Hanford operations.

Paper chromatography as well as thin layer chromatography, using different patterns of solvents and developers, are discussed. It was found that the organic and inorganic species were of different types and the species resulting from (n,gamma) differed from those resulting from beta-decay. The species resulting from beta-decay reaction were little affected by the type of paper chromatography, while those resulting from (n,gamma) reaction were not affected at all. The retention depended on the type of paper and the pattern of solvent/developer. Paper chromatography gave the best results when the compound was dissolved and developed in toluene. The retention values of Lu-177 in three different cases were determined. The obtained retention values indicated that the compound under investigation was not suitable for the purpose of high specific activity radioisotope production. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Determination of U and Th alpha-emitters in NORM samples through extraction chromatography by using new and recycled UTEVA resins	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Uranium; Thorium; NORM samples; Extraction chromatography	URANIUM; SPECTROMETRY	This manuscript describes a protocol for the determination of U and Th isotopes via alpha spectrometry in NORM samples containing high concentrations of these radionuclides, up to kBq kg(-1). This technique is based on extraction chromatography with UTEVA (Triskem Int.) resins and it has been tested using both NORM samples from a phosphate industry and reference materials. The results proved that this method is highly optimized in terms of accuracy and precision when dealing with NORM samples. Recycling of UTEVA columns was also checked using NORM samples and successful results were obtained for both U and Th isotopes, thus proving the feasibility of re-using these type of columns.

Methods: 16 rabbits with tumors were randomly divided into 4 groups. 4 rabbits served as untreated controls, and others received intratumoral administration of P-32-CP-PLLA particles with CT guidance. The total radioactivities in treated groups were as follows: a low activity was 93 MBq (n=4) (group 1), a medium activity was 185 MBq (n=4) (group 2) and a high activity was 370 MBq (n=4) (group 3). Brachytherapy treated VX2 tumors underwent F-18-FDG PET/CT at 0 day, 3 day, 7 day and 14 day postinjection. In control group, F-18-FDG PET/CT images were acquired at the same time points but without any treatment. Bremsstrahlung SPECT images were performed at 14 days after intratumoral brachytherapy in treated groups. After Bremsstrahlung SPECT and last F-18-FDG PET/CT imagings, the rabbits were euthanized and the tumors were removed for histological examination. Results: Bremsstrahlung SPECT images study indicated that there was no leakage of P-32 out of the injection site at 14 days after treatment. Compared with the control, the tumor volumes in treated groups significantly decreased, and P-32-CP-PLLA particle produced a reduction in maximum or mean SUV of VX2 tumor (p < 0.05). The percentage changes in maximum and mean SUV gradually decreased in group 1 and group 2 from day 3 to day 14 (p < 0.05). A transient increase in F-18-FDG accumulation at group 3 occurred due to the inflammatory reaction elements. Activity dependence was seen in HE and PCNA staining after 14 days treatment among three treated groups (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our data suggested that P-32-CP-PLLA particle localized on the injecting sites. This novel brachytherapy device efficiently suppressed the growth of the VX2 tumors implanted in the rabbit. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Selenium-72 formation via Br-nat(p,x) induced by 100 MeV Protons: Steps towards a novel Se-72/As-72 generator system	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Se-72/As generator; Br-nat(p,x) reaction; NaBr target; Thermal analysis; Se-72 recovery; Dithiocarbamate synthesis	SOLID-PHASE EXTRACTION; RELEVANT; NABR	Selenium-72 production by the proton bombardment of a natural NaBr target has been successfully demonstrated at the Los Alamos National Laboratory Isotope Production Facility (LANL-IPF). Arsenic-72 (half life 26 h) is a medium-lived positron emitting radionuclide with the major advantage of being formed as the daughter of another "generator" radioisotope (Se-72, 8.5 d). A Se-72/As-72 generator would be the preferred mechanism for clinical utilization of As-72 for positron emission tomography (PET). No portable Se-72/As-72 generator system has been demonstrated for convenient, repeated As-72 elution ("milking"). In this work, we describe Se-72 production and recovery from irradiated NaBr targets using a 100 MeV proton beam. We also introduce an As-72 generator principle based on Se-72 chelation followed by liquid-liquid extraction, which will be transferred to a solid-phase sorption/elution system.

Module-assisted preparation of Cu-64 with high specific activity	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Cu-64; Cyclotron; Targetry; Automation; PET imaging; Radiotherapy	RADIOISOTOPE PRODUCTION; CYCLOTRON; PET; SEPARATION; NI-64	In this work the production of Cu-64 via the Ni-64(p,n)Cu-64 reaction with optimized conditions for low current irradiation is presented. Different target setups and cleaning steps for lowering metal contaminations in the product were applied. Cu-64 with high specific activities up to 1685 GBq/mu mol was produced despite low overall activity (similar to 4.2 GBq per run). The module processing leads to a highly reproducible, reliable product quality (< 1 mu g Cu and < 7 mu g Ni). Besides its diagnostic value Cu-64 may be of interest even for therapeutic purposes due to its decay characteristics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Improvement of a method for the sequential determination of Pb-210, Ra-226, and uranium isotopes by LSC and alpha-particle spectrometry	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Uranium; Ra-226; (210)pb; Radiochemical method	SAMPLES	In a previous paper the authors proposed a sequential method for the determination of isotopes of uranium, thorium, radium, and lead from environmental samples using alpha-particle spectrometry and LSC techniques. Although the radiochemical yields were suitable when the assays were performed on synthetic samples, application to real environmental samples caused a major decrease in the radiochemical yield, especially for uranium in inorganic samples (soils).
