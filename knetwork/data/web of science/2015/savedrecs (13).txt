The created code was implemented in EGS4 Monte Carlo simulation package. TCS factors were determined for nine different energies for different detector-source geometries. The calculated results were successfully validated by an empirical method using a point Cs-134 radioactive source and a p-type HPGe detector having 55% relative efficiency. Although the code created gives TCS factors only for Cs-134 the technique presented can be used to obtain the factors for any radionuclide used in gamma-ray spectrometry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The ripples of the HVPS have a variety of negative effects on the output high voltage and the neutron yield. In this paper, the 350 kV HVPS ripples were analyzed by means of power spectrum density based on fast Fourier transform. A ripple measurement system with anti-interference measures is developed to acquire the ripples information at the four kinds of output high voltages. The distributions of different frequencies ripples on the HVPS components are obtained from the characteristic frequencies composition of the power spectrum density in accordance with ripples generation mechanism. Furthermore, numerous scientific decisions could be made on the use, maintenance and improvement of the HVPS on the basis of spectrum analyses and diagnoses results.

It is shown that taking into account the kind of radioactive decay, i.e. alpha or beta decay, the Rayleigh density limit results in a critical radius limit for the coalescence and growth of radiative bubbles. Because the size of bubbles is one of the most important parameters to be considered in transport and extraction technologies, the present study has important application for the computational modelling of tritium extraction from liquid Pb-16Li blankets for fusion reactor technologies.

Development and validation of the multi-physics DRACCAR code	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						DRACCAR; Achilles; THETIS; Reflooding; Spent fuel pool; LOCA	AIR	To meet the simulation needs of its LOCA R&D program, the IRSN is developing a multi-rod computational tool named DRACCAR. In order to realistically describe the behavior of the reactor core during a Loss Of Coolant Accident (LOCA), modeling has to take into account many coupled phenomena such as thermics (heat generation, radiation, convection and conduction), hydraulics (multi dimensional 1-3 phase flow, shrinkage), mechanics (thermal dilatation, creep, embrittlement) and chemistry (oxidation, oxygen diffusion, hydriding,...). This paper presents several aspects of the DRACCAR code abilities: first to handle thermal-hydraulics during reflooding of an intact and of a partially ballooned bundle and secondly the simulation of the OECD SFP phase II experiment dealing with the instantaneous draining of a spent fuel pool.

The ultimate goal of the on-going efforts concerning DYNSUB is to provide a cost-effective improved description of light water reactor core behavior with pin-by-pin resolution for both static and transient safety relevant scenarios. A cost-effective computer code is defined to be executable on commodity computing clusters which users/customers commonly have access to. Efforts undertaken to improve DYNSUB's numerical performance and parallelize the code system are presented in this work. Moreover, the coupled code system has been extended in terms of fuel pin level homogenization corrections and flexible mapping schemes. After optimization and extension DYNSUB is successfully applied to study the OECD/NEA and U.S. NRC PWR MOX/UO2 core transient benchmark with both fuel assembly/channel and pin level/sub-channel model resolution. Even though further improvements in terms of numerical performance and accuracy of physical models are required, the applicability of DYNSUB pin-by-pin simulations for light water reactor safety analysis is proven in principle in this work.

Advanced multiphysics coupling for LWR fuel performance analysis	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Multiphysics; Fuel performance analysis	PHASE-FIELD SIMULATION; THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; RADIAL-DISTRIBUTION; GAS-BUBBLES; UO2 FUEL; PART I; BURNUP; MODEL; IRRADIATION; PLUTONIUM	Even the most basic nuclear fuel analysis is a multiphysics undertaking, as a credible simulation must consider at a minimum coupled heat conduction and mechanical deformation. The need for more realistic fuel modeling under a variety of conditions invariably leads to a desire to include coupling between a more complete set of the physical phenomena influencing fuel behavior, including neutronics, thermal hydraulics, and mechanisms occurring at lower length scales. This paper covers current efforts toward coupled multiphysics LWR fuel modeling in three main areas. The first area covered in this paper concerns thermomechanical coupling. The interaction of these two physics, particularly related to the feedback effect associated with heat transfer and mechanical contact at the fuel/clad gap, provides numerous computational challenges. An outline is provided of an effective approach used to manage the nonlinearities associated with an evolving gap in BISON, a nuclear fuel performance application. A second type of multiphysics coupling described here is that of coupling neutronics with thermomechanical LWR fuel performance. DeCART, a high-fidelity core analysis program based on the method of characteristics, has been coupled to BISON. DeCART provides sub-pin level resolution of the multigroup neutron flux, with resonance treatment, during a depletion or a fast transient simulation. Two-way coupling between these codes was achieved by mapping fission rate density and fast neutron flux fields from DeCART to BISON and the temperature field from BISON to DeCART while employing a Picard iterative algorithm. Finally, the need for multiscale coupling is considered. Fission gas production and evolution significantly impact fuel performance by causing swelling, a reduction in the thermal conductivity, and fission gas release. The mechanisms involved occur at the atomistic and grain scale and are therefore not the domain of a fuel performance code. However, it is possible to use lower length scale-models such as those used in the mesoscale MARMOT code to compute average properties, e.g. swelling or thermal conductivity. These may then be used by an engineering-scale model. Examples of this type of multiscale, multiphysics modeling are shown. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Hales, J. D.; Tonks, M.

The innovation consists of the use of 0.015 mm thick dielectric coating as inter-pixel light-insulators, manufactured by Crytur (Czech Republic) intended to improve crystal insulation and then light collection. Respect to the traditional treatment with 0.2 mm of white epoxy, a thinner pixel gap enhances packing fraction up to 98% with a consequent improvement of detection efficiency. Spectroscopic characterization of the array was performed by a Hamamatsu R6231 photomultiplier tube. A pixel-by-pixel scanning with a collimated Tc-99m radioisotope (140 keV photon energy) highlighted a deviation in pulse height close to 3.5% respect to the overall mean value. Meanwhile, in term of energy resolution a difference between the response of single pixel and the array of about 10% was measured. Results were also supported and validated by Monte Carlo simulations performed with GEANT4. Although the dielectric coating pixel insulator cannot overcome the inherent limitations of LuYAP crystal due to its self-absorption of light (still present), this study demonstrated that the new coating treatment allows better light collection (nearly close to the expected one) with in addition a very good uniformity between different pixels. These results confirm the high potentiality of this coating for any other crystal array suited for imaging application and new expectations for the use of LuYAP for PET systems.

Purification of telluric acid for SNO plus neutrinoless double-beta decay search	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Tellurium; Purification; Metal-loaded liquid scintillator; Double beta decay; Neutrino	ACTIVATION	Tellurium 130 has the highest natural abundance of any double beta decay isotopes. Recently it has been developed as a promising candidate for loading in liquid scintillator to explore the Majorana or Dirac nature of the neutrino through a search for neutrinoless double beta decay (ov beta beta). To this end, procedures have been developed to transfer tellurium ions into the organic liquid by a water based loading technology. However, traces of naturally occurring radioactivity and cosmic ray induced isotopes introduced into the sciraillator with tellurium could produce undesirable contaminations in the Te-130 ov beta beta region. Measurements using various elemental spikes prepared from different chemical forms indicate that the uses of self scavenging as well as acid and thermal recrystallization prior to the preparation of a tellurium loaded liquid scintillator can deplete U and Th and several cosmic activated isotopes from Te feedstock by a factor of 10(2)-10(3) in a single pass. The process is also found to improve the optical transmission in the blue region, sensible to the photomultiplier tube, by removing traces of colored impurities. In addition to the scintillator-based experiments, this cleansing scheme has potential applications to the production of radiopure tellurium crystals for other rare-event experiments.

A search for double-electron capture of Se-74 to excited levels using coincidence/anticoincidence gamma-ray spectrometry	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						HPGe spectrometer; Background of HPGe detectors; Double electron-capture decay; Selenium-74	DECAY; RADIOACTIVITY; TECHNOLOGIES	Evaluation of single, coincidence and anticoincidence gamma ray spectrometry methods has been carried out with the aim to search for double electron capture of Se-74 to excited states. This process is unique, because there is probability for transition to the 2+ excited state in Ge-74 (1204 keV), and de excitation through two gamma quanta cascade with energies of 595.9 keV and 608.4 keV. Long-term measurements with an anticosmic shielded HPGe (high purity Ge) spectrometer and a coincidence HPGe-NaI(TI) spectrometer did not show any evidence for the double electron capture in Se-74. The best limit for the half-life of the double electron capture in Se-74 (both for the neutrinoless and two neutrino processes) was estimated to be > 1.5 x 10(19) yr. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio, we employed coincident photon counting. Additionally, the charge of the photo sensor signals was measured to estimate the number of detected photons accurately. In addition, proper corrections were incorporated for the wavelength; response functions of the apparatus obtained using a low-pressure mercury lamp, and photon detection efficiencies of the optical system were considered. The obtained omission spectrum is found to be in the shape of a Gaussian function, with the center at 57,199 perpendicular to 34 (sta.) +/- 33 (syst.) cm(-1) (174.8 +/- 0.1 (stat.) +/- 0.1 (syst.) urn) and the full width at half maximum of 3328 +/- 72 (slat.) +/- 65 (syst.) cm(-1) (10.2 +/- 02 (stat.) +/- 0.2 (sys.) urn), These results are the most accurate values obtained in terms of the data acquisition method and the calibration for the experimental system and provide valuable information regarding the high precision instruments that employ a liquid xenon scintillator.

As a complement to single and multichannel detection algorithms, inefficient under too low signal-to-noise ratios, temporal correlation algorithms have been introduced. Test hypothesis methods based on empirically estimated mean and variance of the signals delivered by the different channels have shown significant gain in terms of a tradeoff between detection sensitivity and false alarm probability. This paper discloses the concept of a new hypothesis test for temporal correlation detection methods, taking advantage of the Poisson nature of the registered counting signals, and establishes a benchmark between this test and its empirical counterpart. The simulation study validates that in the four relevant configurations of a pedestrian source carrier under respectively high and low count rate radioactive backgrounds, and a vehicle source carrier under the same respectively high and low count rate radioactive backgrounds, the newly introduced hypothesis test ensures a significantly improved compromise between sensitivity and false alarm It also guarantees that the optimal coverage factor for this compromise remains stable regardless of signal-to-noise ratio variations between 2 and 0.8, therefore allowing the final user to parametrize the test with the sole prior knowledge of background amplitude.

Si and GaAs were selected as the energy conversion devices in four types of betavoltaic microbatteries, and Ni-63 and Pm-147 were used as beta sources. Current density-voltage curves were determined at a temperature range of 213.15-333.15 K. A simplified method was used to calculate the theoretical parameters of the betavoltaic microbatteries considering the energy loss of beta particles for self-absorption of radioactive source, the electron backscatter effect of different types of semiconductor materials, and the absorption of dead layer. Both the experimental and theoretical results show that the short-circuit current density increases slightly and the open-circuit voltage (V-OC) decreases evidently with the increase in temperature. Different combinations of energy conversion devices and beta sources cause different effects of temperature on the microbatteries. In the approximately linear range, the V-OC sensitivities caused by temperature for Ni-63-Si, Ni-63-GaAs, Pm-147-Si, and Pm-147-GaAs betavoltaic microbatteries were -2.57, -5.30, -2.53, and -4.90 mV/K respectively. Both theoretical and experimental energy conversion efficiency decreased evidently with the increase in temperature. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Investigation of material property influenced stoichiometric deviations as evidenced during UV laser-assisted atom probe tomography in fluorite oxides	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Field evaporation; Laser-material interactions; Stoichiometry; Uranium oxide; Cerium oxide	URANIUM-DIOXIDE; DOPED CERIA; UO2; CEO2; ENERGY; FIELD	Oxide materials are used in numerous applications such as thermal barrier coatings, nuclear fuels, and electrical conductors and sensors, all applications where nanometer-scale stoichiometric changes can affect functional properties. Atom probe tomography can be used to characterize the precise chemical distribution of individual species and spatially quantify the oxygen to metal ratio at the nanometer scale. However, atom probe analysis of oxides can be accompanied by measurement artifacts caused by laser-material interactions. In this investigation, two technologically relevant oxide materials with the same crystal structure and an anion to cation ratio of 2.00, pure cerium oxide (CeO2) and uranium oxide (UO2) are studied. It was determined that electronic structure, optical properties, heat transfer properties, and oxide stability strongly affect their evaporation behavior, thus altering their measured stoichiometry, with thermal conductance and thermodynamic stability being strong factors.

The method is independent of the measurement geometry, sample form and chemical composition. Since U-232 is an artificially produced isotope, it carries information about previous irradiation of the material, which is relevant for nuclear forensics, nuclear safeguards and for nuclear reactor operations. A correlation between the U-232 content and U-235 enrichment of the investigated samples has been established, which is consistent with theoretical predictions. It is also shown how the correlation of the mass ratio U-232/U-235 VS. U-235 content can be used to distinguish materials contaminated with reprocessed uranium from materials made of reprocessed uranium. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Reducing DRIFT backgrounds with a submicron aluminized-mylar cathode	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						DRIFT; NITPC; WIMP; Dark matter; Radon; Uranium	DARK-MATTER DETECTOR; PARTICLES	Background events in the DRIFT-Ild dark matter detector, mimicking potential WIMP signals, are predominantly caused by alpha decays on the central cathode in which the alpha particle is completely or partially absorbed by the cathode material. We installed a 0.9 mu m thick aluminized-mylar cathode as a way to reduce the probability of producing these backgrounds. We study three generations of cathode (wire, thin-film, and radiologically clean thin-film) with a focus on the ratio of background events to alpha decays. Two independent methods of measuring the absolute alpha decay rate are used to ensure an accurate result, and agree to within 10%. Using alpha range spectroscopy, we measure the radiologically cleanest cathode version to have a contamination of 3.3 +/- 0.1 ppt U-234 and 73 +/- 2 ppb U-238. This cathode reduces the probability of producing an RPR from an alpha decay by a factor of 70 +/- 20 compared to the original stainless steel wire cathode. First results are presented from a texturized version of the cathode, intended to be even more transparent to alpha particles. These efforts, along with other background reduction measures, have resulted in a drop in the observed background rate from 500/day to With the recent implementation of full volume fiducialization, these remaining background events are identified, allowing for background free operation.

A multiple parallel-plate avalanche counter for fission-fragment detection	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Fission; Uranium; Plutonium; Californium-252; Parallel-plate avalanche counter		A new low-mass multiple gas-filled parallel-plate avalanche counter for the fission-fragment detection has been developed to mark the fission occurrence in measurements of the prompt fission neutron energy spectrum as a function of incident neutron energy. It was used successfully for the neutron-induced fission of U-235 and (PU)-P-239 with a total mass near 100 mg each and the spontaneous fission of Cf-252. Both the incident neutron energy and the prompt fission neutron energy are measured by using the time-of-tlight method. The design and performance of this avalanche counter are described.

Variance estimation in neutron coincidence counting using the bootstrap method	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Neutron multiplicity counting; Bootstrap method; Passive interrogation statistical variance		In the study, we demonstrate the implementation of the "bootstrap" method for a reliable estimation of the statistical error in Neutron Multiplicity Counting (NMC) on plutonium samples. The "bootstrap" method estimates the variance a a measurement through a re-sampling process, in which a large number of pseudo-samples are generated, from which the so-called bootstrap distribution is generated. The outline of the present study is to give a full description of the bootstrapping procedure, and to validate, through experimental results, the reliability of the estimated variance. Results indicate both a very good agreement between the measured variance and the variance obtained through the bootstrap method, and a robustness of the method with respect to the duration of the measurement and the bootstrap parameters.

This necessitates either using a single detector-source pair and translating the barrel or using multiple detector-source pairs for increasing the scanning speed. Additionally, because the use of bulky HPGe detectors may limit the number of detectors used in both active and passive modes, we propose to use 1" x 1" LaBr3(Ce) scintillators. This paper describes a practical fan-beam reconstruction for A&PCT imaging of waste barrels. A fan beam system model has been computed analytically and reconstruction done using MLEM algorithm. The results are compared with analytical reconstruction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Roy, Tushar; More, M.

The main accelerator for the in-flight system accelerates uranium and proton beams to 200 MeNifu and 660 MeV, respectively, with a beam power of 400 kW. The front-end system consists of two 28 GHz electron cyclotron resonance ion sources (10 IceV/u), a low energy beam transport (LEBT) line with two 90' bends, a multi harmonic bundler with three different ri frequencies, a radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ), and a medium energy beam transport line (MEBT) with three rebunchers and eight quadrupoles. A driver linac system consisting of Linac-1 and Linac-2 has been designed to optimize the beam and accelerator parameters so as to meet the required design goals. A charge stripper section is located between Linac-1 and Linac-2. To optimize these designs, we performed sLarL-Lo-end simulations with the beams from the LEBT to Linac-2 using 1 million macroparLicles. We present the resulting beam dynamics to evaluate the performance of the accelerator. Our simulation results predict that the transmission rate of the uranium beam is 85.8% from the LEBT to Linac-2. The designed facility is expected to achieve the required beam loss condition of less than 1 Wfm, The RAON driver linac lattice design was developed and an overview of the beam dynamics is presented.

Chromic-acid-treated amidoxime fibers were synthesized based on the simultaneous irradiation grafting method at a low temperature. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) fibers were treated with chromic acid for up to 90 minutes. After the treatment, the fibers were submerged in 60:40 acrylonitrile:methacrylic acid monomer by volume and irradiated with 40 kGy gamma-ray. The maximum grafting efficiency of about 90% occurred at 20 minutes of acid treatment time, as a significant enhancement of 30% compared to the literature-reported value of about 70%. When submerged in shallow seawater with an average temperature of 30 degrees C for 4 weeks, the amidoxime adsorbent exhibited the adsorption capacity of 2.06g-U/kg-adsorbent, which was 37% higher than the literature-reported value. These significantly increased grafting and adsorption efficiencies were attributed to the increased surface area of chromic-acid-etched LDPE fibers. Moreover, for the submersion up to 8 weeks, the adsorption increased to 2.15g-U/kg-adsorbent. The adsorption capacity was evaluated to reduce to about 65% after eight cycles of repeated usage. Uranium concentrations in Thailand's seawater collected at various depths and locations were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to be about 3 ppb everywhere.

Considering that kriging can consider the spatial correlation of radioactivity concentrations between different points, we propose a method of applying kriging to ensure compliance with the site release criterion. Estimated radioactivity concentrations exhibit uncertainty, which results in a certain probability of the occurrence of decision errors regarding site release. We describe a method for calculating the uncertainty as a function of the number of measurement points and establish a minimum number of measurement points required for a given error probability. We applied the proposed method and a conventional statistical method to two sample cases. It was observed that the proposed method appropriately estimated the mean radioactivity concentration even if the measurement points were distributed inhomogeneously. This method was observed to lead to an efficient measurement requiring fewer measurement points relative to the conventional statistical method when spatial correlation existed.

Questions concerning the need for reprocessing and subsequent isolation of high-level wastes are elucidated. It is shown that the BN-1200 and BREST fast reactors now under consideration for closing the fuel cycle do not permit efficient use of plutonium, because for the existing spent-fuel reprocessing technologies these reactors could be very expensive or a long cool-down time may be required, which will reduce the positive effect from closing the fuel cycle.

Modeling of C-14 Diffusion from the Core of the Decommissioned ad Reactor	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								A mathematical model of the diffusion of radionuclides through engineered safety barriers is developed for C-14 in order to determine the long-term safety conditions and characteristics of a decommissioned commercial uranium-graphite reactor. Dry and wet mixtures and concrete are used as the barrier materials. Diffusion is studied as the dominant mechanism for the transport of the radionuclides. The C-14 concentration at the boundary between the radwaste storage site and the environment is determined computationally and the effect of the modeling conditions on the specific activity of the radionuclide is analyzed. The decomposition sequence of the safety barriers for which the C-14 concentration is much lower than the admissible value is determined.	[Antonenko, M. V.; Chubreev, D.

Radiological aspects and behavior of spent fuel considering long-term storage	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	EUROSAFE Forum	NOV 04-05, 2013	Cologne, GERMANY			Long-term storage; Cladding; Temperature; Hoop stress; Dose rate		For spent nuclear fuel management in Germany, the concept of dry interim storage in dual purpose casks before direct disposal is applied. Current operation licenses for storage facilities have been granted for a storage time of 40 years. Due to the current delay in site selection, an extension of the storage time seems inevitable. In consideration of this issue, GRS performed burnup calculations, thermal and mechanical analyses as well as particle transport and shielding calculations for UO2 and MOX fuels stored in a cask to investigate long-term behavior of the spent fuel related parameters and the radiological consequences. It is shown that at the beginning of the dry storage period, cladding hoop stress levels sufficient to cause hydride reorientation could be present in fuel rods with a burnup higher than 55 GWd/tHM. The long-term behavior of the cladding temperatures indicates the possibility of reaching the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature during extended storage scenarios. Surface dose rates are 3 times higher when a cask is partially loaded with 4 MOX fuel assemblies. Due to radioactive decay, long-term storage will have a positive impact on the radiological environment around the cask. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Large scale in-situ experiments on sealing constructions in underground disposal facilities for radioactive wastes - Examples of recent BfS- and GRS-activities	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	EUROSAFE Forum	NOV 04-05, 2013	Cologne, GERMANY			Underground disposal facilities for radioactive wastes; Sealing constructions; In-situ experiments; Drift seals; Long-term behaviour of the sealing materials; Closure of the low- and intermediate-level waste disposal facility Morsleben (ERAM)		This paper shows examples of in-situ constructions and laboratory tests that have been designed and implemented by BfS and GRS in order to demonstrate the technical feasibility of special constructions for the sealing of drifts and shafts in different salt formations. Since it is often not possible to directly verify the long-term functionality (for times scales envisaged in long-term safety assessments) of such constructions, an overall understanding of the main chemical and physical processes involved needs to be developed. Such an understanding is required in order to extrapolate the evolution of a sealing system with a sufficient degree of reliability. Laboratory tests and large-scale in-situ tests are necessary and integral parts of the procedures for enhancing the process understanding. Based on a safety case, BfS has developed a robust decommissioning concept for the closure of the low- and intermediate-level waste disposal facility Morsleben (ERAM) which also takes into account the retention of radionuclides by combined effects of different sealing components. GRS has contributed to this concept with laboratory tests and modelling of the long-term behaviour of the sealing material "salt concrete" foreseen for the sealing constructions in Morsleben. Salt concrete is based on the cement Portlandite i.e., on CaO. Furthermore GRS has also investigated the MgO based "sorel concrete" employed by BfS for the Asse project. The chemical corrosion path and the subsequent permeability changes for both concretes have been investigated with test procedures developed in the GRS laboratory. GRS has also developed a new Self-Sealing material "Selbst Verheilender Versatz - SVV" (SVV, German for Self Sealing Backfill) and tested in laboratory and in-situ experiments. With this material it is possible to achieve an instantaneous and long-lasting permeability reduction within the complex system consisting of the sealing construction and the Excavation Demaged Zone (EDZ) upon brine intrusion. The presentation demonstrates details of the concepts and highlights results from the BfS in-situ experiments in Morsleben and the preceding GRS laboratory and in-situ tests. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The reactor accidents at Fukushima Dai-ichi in March 2011 gave reason and indications for checking the risk assessment approach for internal and external hazards as currently described in the German PSA Guideline and its supplementary technical documents. A standardized approach for performing a comprehensive HPSA has been developed emphasizing the complete consideration of all potential failure dependencies induced by hazards. The systematic extension of the given plant model of Level 1 PSA is the real crux of the new HPSA approach. The extension is carried out for each hazard H using the corresponding hazard equipment list (H-EL) and the corresponding hazard dependency list (H-DL). Parts of the approach have already been tested. In the paper a successful application for the plant internal hazard fire is presented. A German licensee plans a system modification of the spent fuel pool cooling, therefore a Level 1 PSA has been carried out to compare the fuel damage frequencies for the existing and the modified version. It is outlined how the systematic (and partly automatic) extension of the fault trees is performed using a so-called Fire Equipment List (F-EL). The F-EL contains a compartment assignment for all relevant components and cables. The probability of a compartment failure by fire must be determined for any compartment mapped. This is the conditional probability that the components and cables within the compartment are inoperable due to the fire. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Lithuanian laws on nuclear energy and radioactive waste management require that dismantling and decontamination projects shall be licensed by the Lithuanian State Nuclear Power Safety Inspectorate and other Authorities. Licensing is an inseparable part of the Lithuanian regulatory and supervisory system for safety of nuclear facilities. The licensing process starts when the nuclear power plant submits the first licensing document(s) to the Authorities. Usually the licensing documents cover Basic Design, Safety Assessment, Environmental Impact Assessment and Civil Design reports. Safety Assessment Report is a major document, which justifies that the proposed activities will be implemented in compliance with design and regulatory requirements. Licensing process is completed when all the licensing documents are approved by the Authorities and authorization to start dismantling and decontamination activities is received by the nuclear power plant. Current paper discusses the main steps of the licensing process adopted for the first dismantling and decontamination projects at Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant and provides examples of safety assessment in the case of bounding initiating events that can be caused by dismantling and decommissioning activities.

A site selection process based on safety criteria, defined in the "Sectoral plan for deep geological repositories", will be followed by a step-by-step licensing process under the responsibility of the Federal Government. Stage 1 of the Sectoral Plan has been successfully completed and geological siting regions identified. Stage 2, currently underway, has included the participation of a wide range of stakeholder to identify sites for the surface facilities. It will lead to the narrowing down of the number of geological siting regions by means of a safety-based comparison. Key factors for successful site selection include: (i) A clearly defined stepwise approach with the criteria defined before starting site selection with first priority given to safety; (ii) a process in which all stakeholders are prepared to commit themselves and work together, and are ready to accept the basic rules defined beforehand; (iii) for this purpose, it is important to have a strong process owner who keeps the process on track.

Additionally, the 2012 Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommendations, the future of reprocessing, consolidated interim spent fuel storage, and maintaining technical competence within the NRC in challenging budgetary conditions are addressed. I conclude that there is confidence in the feasibility of safe storage of spent nuclear fuel following the licensed operational life of a reactor and any change in high-level waste policy will require Congressional action to amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.

Methodological approach to a safety analysis of radioactive waste disposal in rock salt: An example	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	EUROSAFE Forum	NOV 04-05, 2013	Cologne, GERMANY			Radioactive waste; Final disposal; Safety analysis; Safety assessment; Repository design; Rock salt		A methodological approach was applied in preparing of the project "Preliminary Safety Analysis of the Gorleben Site" according to the German requirements for final disposal of heat generating radioactive waste. The German requirements and the approach are based on recent international documents from IAEA and OECD/NEA on safety assessment and the safety case. The approach included the description of the geological site and its future evolution coupled with a range of possible waste emplacement scenarios using site specific repository designs. The repository designs were developed to provide operational safety, long-term safety and retrievability/recoverability of the waste to comply with the German safety requirements. The German requirements require ongoing optimisation of repository designs. Analysis of the integrity, fluid flows and radiological consequences was done and the performance of the system was assessed. If the present assumptions are confirmed by future research and development, the designed repository system for drift disposal was assessed to be robust. Further optimization is possible in relation to gaseous radionuclide species for the drift disposal design and in relation to the technology of retrieval for the borehole disposal design. The site specific safety analysis identified important tasks for research and development which would have not been possible by a generic safety analysis. The methodology and safety concept can be applied to other salt rock sites and can be transferred partially to clay sites. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the concepts of microdosimetry are not generally intuitive to the public or indeed to health physicists. In this article, the methods of conventional internal dosimetry was applied to different forms of radioactive iodine to derive cell-hit numbers and cell fractions affected by low-level exposures, and it is shown that microdosimetric analysis is compatible with conventional dosimetry but has the advantage of underscoring the stochastic nature of ionising radiation at low dose. The microdosimetric description of low-dose exposures derived in this work could be improved with the use of Monte Carlo track structure codes and more realistic models of different tissues and their cellular structure.

SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF AUGER ELECTRONS EMITTED FROM INTERNALISED RADIONUCLIDES IN CANCER CELLS: THE PHOTORESIST AUTORADIOGRAPHY (PAR) METHOD	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th International Symposium on Microdosimetry (MICROS)	OCT 20-25, 2013	Trevisto, ITALY	INFN, Lab Nazl Legnaro, NASA, Johnson Space Ctr, Univ Nevada, Houston & Hlth Phys & Diagnost Sci Dept, Int Commiss Radiat Units & Measurements, Univ Oxford, Oxford Inst Radiat Oncol			MONTE-CARLO-SIMULATION; CELLULAR DOSIMETRY; SOLID TUMORS; RADIOACTIVITY; RESOLUTION; THERAPY; RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY; CYTOTOXICITY; POPULATIONS; IRRADIATION	Microdosimetric evaluation of Auger electron-emitting radionuclides involves a detailed evaluation of energy deposition at a nanometre scale. To perform Monte Carlo modelling of such energy deposition, accurate information regarding the spatial distribution of the radionuclide is required. A recent addition to the methods for determining the spatial distribution of cellular internalised radionuclides is based on detection in a polymer photoresist (e.g. polymethyl methacralate), followed by atomic force microscopy analysis of the resultant 3D pattern. In comparison with present practice, the method offers greater spatial resolution and improved quantification. The volume of the pattern is proportional to the total dose, thereby permitting assessment of variability of accumulated activity, while the variation in depth across the pattern reflects the lateral spatial distribution in the local fluence per unit area. An added advantage is the similarity in response to ionising radiation of an organic polymer compared to that of biological material. A pattern in the resist from radiation emitted by a radionuclide treated cell gives additional spatial information about the energy deposited in the resist.	[Royle, G.; Vallis, K.

Progress on the development and design of both a shattered pellet injector (SPI) that produces large solid cryogenic pellets to provide reliable deep penetration of material and a fast opening high flow rate gas valve for massive gas injection (MGI) is presented. Cryogenic pellets of deuterium and neon up to 25 mm in size have been formed and accelerated with a prototype injector and a full scale prototype MGI valve is now in testing. Implications of the design with respect to response time and reliability at the proposed injector locations on ITER are discussed.	[Baylor, L. R.; Barbier, C. C.; Carmichael, J. R.; Combs, S.

The tritium self-sufficiency, blanket testing, and materials testing are of particular interest since they define a critical element of the FNSF mission. There is a definitive need to breed the majority of if not all, the tritium required for operation. A staged blanket testing strategy has been developed to test and enhance the blanket performance during each phase of operation. A materials testing module is critically important to include in FNSF to test large specimens of future generations of materials (for blanket, divertor, magnets, etc.) in relevant fusion environment. In this strategy, the test modules play a pivotal role and serve as "forerunners" for more advanced versions of blanket and materials that will validate their characteristics and features to assure the successful operation of DEMO and advanced power plants.

PPPL ST-FNSF ENGINEERING DESIGN DETAILS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	21st American-Nuclear-Society (ANS) Topical Meeting on the Technology of Fusion Energy (TOFE)	NOV 10-13, 2014	Anaheim, CA	Amer Nucl Soc, US Dept Energy, Off Fusion Energy Sci				One of the goals of the PPPL Spherical Tokamak (ST) Fusion Nuclear Science Facility (FNSF) study was to generate a self-consistent conceptual design of an ST-FNSF device with sufficient physics and engineering details to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of different designs and to assess various ST-FNSF missions. This included striving to achieve tritium self-sufficiency; the ability to provide shielding protection of vital components and to develop maintenance strategies that could be used to maintain the in-vessel components (divertors, breeding blankets, shield modules and services) and characterize design upgrade potentials to expanded mission evolutions. With the conceptual design of a 2.2 m ST pilot plant design already completed emphasis was placed on evaluating a range of ST machine sizes looking at a major radius of 1m and a mid-range device size between I m and 2.2 m. This paper will present an engineering summary of the design details developed from this study, expanding on earlier progress reports presented at earlier conferences that focused on a mid-size 1.7 m device. Further development has been made by physics in defining a Super-X divertor arrangement that provides an expanded divertor surface area and places all PF coils outside the TF coil inner bore, in regions that improve the device maintenance characteristics. Physics, engineering design and neutronics analysis for both the 1.7 m and I m device have been enhanced. The engineering results of the PPPL ST-FNSF study will be presented along with comments on possible future directions.

VACUUM PERMEATOR ANALYSIS FOR EXTRACTION OF TRITIUM FROM DCLL BLANKETS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	21st American-Nuclear-Society (ANS) Topical Meeting on the Technology of Fusion Energy (TOFE)	NOV 10-13, 2014	Anaheim, CA	Amer Nucl Soc, US Dept Energy, Off Fusion Energy Sci			FLUID FRICTION; MASS-TRANSFER; LI17PB83; SOLUBILITY; DIFFUSION; PB-17LI; ALLOY; FLOW	It is envisioned that tritium will be extracted from DCLL blankets using a vacuum permeator. We derive here an analytical solution for the extraction efficiency of a permeator tube, which is a function of only two dimensionless numbers: one that indicates whether radial transport is limited by the PbLi or by the solid membrane, and another that is the ratio of axial and radial transport times in the PbLi. The permeator efficiency is maximized by decreasing the velocity and tube diameter, and increasing the tube length. This is true regardless of the mass transport correlation used; we review several and find that they differ little, and the choice of correlation is not a source of significant uncertainty here. The PbLi solubility, on the other hand, is a large source of uncertainty, and we identify upper and lower bounds from the literature data. Under the most optimistic assumptions, we find that a ferritic steel permeator operating at 470 degrees C will need to be about twenty times larger in volume than previous conceptual designs using niobium and operating at higher temperatures.

The estimation of tritium inventories in various components of the HCCR submodule and its permeation amount into the helium coolant was obtained through three computational models involving: I) a 3D FW standalone model where diffusion and permeation into FW He coolant through tritium ion implantation was studied, 2) a 2D Poloidal-Radial (P-R) mid-plane model where the effect of increased tritium concentration in the purge gas stream was accounted for, and 3) a 2D Toroidal-Radial (T-R) mid-plane model to study tritium concentration accumulation in the He coolant. The analysis shows that tritium inventory in the breeder reaches an equilibrium value in about 10 cycles, and is about 0.373 mg per submodule. Tritium inventory in the ferritic steel structure reaches its equilibrium value in less than 10 cycles, and has about 0.0012 mg per submodule at the end of the plasma burn. The amount of the tritium permeated into helium coolant is about 1.8% of the amount of tritium produced per cycle.

The rate constant of tritiated water formation by CuO catalyst at the temperature above 500 K was determined to be k [s(-1)] = 5.4x10(5) exp (-0.65 eV / k(B)T). For the flow rate less than 50 sccm, it was found that the reaction rate will be controlled by the desorption rate of HTO on the surface of CuO. These results were applied for the design of tritium removal system at radiation-controlled area. It was concluded that the reactor tubing with 1.0 meter length at 600 K will be suitable to reduce the tritium concentration less than 1/1000 and the longer reactor tubing will be required if the operation temperature will be lower than 600 K	[Oya, Yasuhisa; Sato, Misaki; Yuyama, Kenta; Chikada, Takumi] Shizuoka Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Suruga Ku, Shizuoka 4228529, Japan; [Hara, Masanori; Hatano, Yuji; Matsuyama, Masao] Toyama Univ, Hydrogen Isotope Res Ctr, Toyama 9308555, Japan	Oya, Y (reprint author), Shizuoka Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Suruga Ku, 836 Ohya, Shizuoka 4228529, Japan.	oya.yasuhisa@shizuoka.ac.jp			University of Toyama collaboration program [HRC2014-01]	This study is supported by University of Toyama collaboration program, HRC2014-01.

QUANTIFICATION OF DOMINATING FACTORS IN TRITIUM PERMEATION IN PbLi BLANKETS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	21st American-Nuclear-Society (ANS) Topical Meeting on the Technology of Fusion Energy (TOFE)	NOV 10-13, 2014	Anaheim, CA	Amer Nucl Soc, US Dept Energy, Off Fusion Energy Sci			TRANSPORT	In this paper the problem of tritium transport in PbLi (Lead-Lithium) blankets has been studied and analyzed by means of our recently developed computational models. Several simulations are performed by incorporating the geometric configurations of the PbLi blankets including both DCLL (Dual Coolant Lead Lithium) and HCLL (Helium Cooled Lead Lithium) blankets. Tritium permeation loss percentage from the HCLL concept is about one order of magnitude higher than from the DCLL concept (similar to 17%. vs. 1.2%). Sensitivity study also shows that the most relevant factors on tritium permeation are: 1) the level of tritium solubility in PbLi, 2) the gap velocity of the liquid metal in a DCLL blanket, 3) Hartmann number, and 4) the FCI (Flow Channel Insert) electrical conductivity.

Korea has been developing an SDS. The main purpose of this tritium storage and delivery system is to store and supply the D-T gas needed for DT plasma operation and to provide the necessary infrastructure for short- and long-term storage of large amounts of tritium. We have been developing tritium storage beds for the SDS. The primary role of the metal hydride beds in the SDS is to store and supply D-T fuel during DT plasma operation. ZrCo and depleted uranium (DU) have been extensively studied. Compared to the use of ZrCo, which is disproportionate at temperatures of higher than 350 degrees C, DU hydride can be heated up to very high temperatures sufficient to pump hydrogen isotopes without using gas compressors. Our experimental apparatus used to test the experimental DU bed consists of a tank that stores and measures the hydrogen, and a DU bed used for the hydriding/dehydriding of hydrogen. Our DU bed is a horizontal double-cylinder type with sintered metal filters. The bed is composed of primary and secondary vessels. The primary vessel contains a DU, and a vacuum layer is formed between the primary and secondary vessels. In this study, we present our recent experimental results on the direct delivery of hydrogen isotopes from a DU hydride bed. We also present the effect of the initial bed temperature and impurity gas on the hydriding rates.

The fusion DEMO reactor is planned to start up in the 2030s. Herein, methods for supplying the reactor with tritium are discussed. For the initial startup of the fusion reactor, use of a high temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) as a tritium production device has been proposed So far, the analyses have been focused only on the operation in which fuel is exchanged at stated periods (batch) using the block type HTGR. In this paper, to improve the performance of tritium production, properties of the HTGR are studied from the viewpoint of continuous operation for several conditions. In continuous operation, for example, in the pebble bed type HTGR, it is possible to design an operation that has no time loss for refueling. The pebble bed modular reactor (PBMR) and the gas turbine high temperature reactor of 300 MWe nominal capacity (GTHTR300) are assumed as the calculation and comparison targets, and simulation is made using the continuous-energy Monte Carlo transport code MVP-BURN. It is shown that the continuous operation using the pebble bed type HTGR has almost the same tritium productivity compared with the batch operation using the block type HGTR.

In the basic case, the main parameters of the DEMO reactor are a major radius of 8.2 m and a fusion power of 1.35 GW. Blanket segments and divertor cassettes should be replaced independently, as their lifetimes differ. A blanket segment comprises several blanket modules mounted to a back-plate. The total weight of an in-vessel component is estimated to be about 6,648 ton (1,575, 3,777, 372, and 924 ton of blanket module, back-plate, conducting shell, and divertor cassette, respectively). The lifetimes of a blanket segment and a divertor cassette are assumed to be 2.2 years and 0.6 years, respectively, and 52,487 tons of waste is generated over a plant life of 20 years. Therefore, there is a concern that the contamination-control area for radioactive waste may need to increase due to the amount of waste generated from every replacement. This paper proposes a management scenario to reduce radioactive waste. When feasible and relevant, back-plates of blanket segment and divertor cassette bodies (628 ton) should be reused. Using the three-dimensional neutron transportation code MCNP, the displacement per atom (DPA) of the SUS316LN back-plates is 0.2 DPA/year and that of the F82H cassette bodies is 0.6 DPA/year. Therefore, the reuse of back-plates and cassette bodies would be possible if re-welding points are arranged under neutron shielding. We found that radioactive waste could be reduced to 20 % when tritium breeding materials are recycled. Finally, we propose a design for the DEMO building that uses a hot cell and temporary storage.

EXPERIMENT ON RECOVERY OF HYDROGEN FROM FLUIDIZED Li17Pb83 BLANKET	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	21st American-Nuclear-Society (ANS) Topical Meeting on the Technology of Fusion Energy (TOFE)	NOV 10-13, 2014	Anaheim, CA	Amer Nucl Soc, US Dept Energy, Off Fusion Energy Sci			ISOTOPIC EXCHANGE; EUTECTIC ALLOY; LITHIUM; LI0.17PB0.83; PERMEATION; DIFFUSION	Development of an efficient tritium recovery method is indispensable in order to compose a liquid blanket system of a D-T fusion reactor in the near future. Here, tritium recovery using a bubbling tower is focused on, and the behavior of H transfer between fluidized lithium-lead (Li-Pb) and gas bubbles of Ar-H-2 or pure Ar is examined analytically and experimentally under isothermal conditions. Gas of Ar-H-2 or pure Ar is injected into fluidized Li-Pb through an I-shape nozzle made from SS-316. Time variations of the H-2 concentration in gas bubbles that come out from fluidized Li-Pb are measured by gas chromatography. Mass-transfer coefficients to correlate rates of H atom transfer between Li-Pb and gas bubbles are obtained by fitting analytical equations to experimental results. The solution is derived under conditions where H transfer between bubbles and liquid Li-Pb is limited by diffusion in the Li-Pb boundary layer. The parameters such as bubble diameter and terminal rising velocity which are used in order to derive analytic formula are estimated from balance among several forces such as gravity, surface tension, inertia force and so on. The behavior of hydrogen transfer at gas-liquid interfaces in liquid blanket is investigated in terms of the mass-transfer coefficient obtained under various conditions.

From tritium balance, 22.5 % (7.1 MBq) of input tritium (31.5 MBq) was retained in the soil bed. By distilled water purge, 70 % (5 MBq) of retained tritium was recovered but 30% (2.1 MBq) was left. To recover residual tritium, the soil was immersed in distilled water for 531 days but the amount of tritium released to distilled water was slight (0.04 MBq). A part of the soil immersed in the water was taken out and heated up to 300 degrees C under humid oxygen atmosphere. Tritium release terminated at about 50 hours. 11 % (0.23 MBq) of retained tritium was released. By heating to 1000 degrees C, the release amount of tritium increased proportionally to the time and additional 4% (0.09 MBq) was released at 5 hours. The desorption rates of tritium in each process was quantified. Tritium is quite slowly released from the natural soil exposed to tritiated water in water at room temperature. However, a long time heating by 1000 degrees C would be required to try to recover all tritium from the contaminated soil positively, although tritium recovery was not completed in this work.

In this paper, the disintegration and dissolution of spent cationic resins were studied by Fenton-like process. The influencing factors on resin dissolution, such as pH, temperature, type and concentration of catalysts were evaluated. The results showed that the spent resins could be effectively dissolved at pH < 1, [Fe2+]= 0.2 M and T = 97 +/- 2 degrees C. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction rate was more than 99%. The scanning electron microscopy and the Raman spectrum were used to observe the morphological changes of the spent resins during the dissolution process. Fenton-like oxidation is an efficient method for the volume reduction and stabilization of the spent resins before further immobilization. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Basically, radiation shielding performance and safe removal of decay heat, which play important roles in the safety performance, were checked and validated using the Monte Carlo method and finite element analysis to establish the radiation dose rate calculation model and three-dimensional heat transfer model for the CHN-24 container. The dose rates at the surface of the container and at a distance of 1 m from the surface were 0.42 mSv/h and 0.06 mSv/h, respectively. These conform to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) radioactive material transportation safety standards 2 mSv/h and 0.1 mSv/h. The results shows that the CHN-24 container maintains its structural and material integrity under the condition of normal thermal steady-state heat transfer as well as in case of extreme fire as evinced by transient-state analysis. The temperature inside and on the surface of the container were 150.91 degrees C and 80 degrees C under normal storage conditions, which indicated that the design also conform to IAEA heat transfer safety standards of 190 degrees C and 85 degrees C.
