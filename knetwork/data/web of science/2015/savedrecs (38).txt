RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINATION OF SPENT REACTOR GRAPHITE	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The radioactive contamination of the spent graphite of uranium-graphite reactors is analyzed. The formation of the radioactive contamination during irradiation for 30-35 years is described. The contamination of graphite samples by radionuclides, including the products of activation of impurities and fission products, and by actinides is examined for three commercial uranium-graphite reactors at the Siberian Chemical Combine, the AM-1 reactor at the Physics and Power Engineering Institute, and the thermal column of the IRT reactor at the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute. It is concluded that C-14 makes the main contribution to the activity of the graphite. The mass of the radionuclides in the bricks of the I-1, EI-2, and ADE-3 reactors at the Siberian Chemical Combine is presented. Some questions concerning the handling of the spent graphite are examined.	[Bushuev, A. V.; Kozhin, A. F.; Zubarev, V. N.; Aleeva, T. B.; Petrova, E. V.; Glagovskii, E. M.; Rudenko, V.

UNCONVENTIONAL METHODS OF RADIOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND EARTHQUAKE PREDICTION	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								Methods of radiological monitoring of the environment that can be used on objects utilizing atomic energy, including NPP, are examined. The methods are based on the indications of sensors measuring the dose rate and the spectral characteristics of photon radiation. The sensors can be placed in the opening of a vent stack as well as on unmanned radio-controlled aircraft and underwater apparatus. Radiological monitoring is accomplished in real-time by transmitting information along a radio channel to the pilot's and dosimetrist's consoles. A method of remote radiological monitoring where the diagnostics apparatus is a radar station operating in a definite wavelength range is briefly described. The use of cryogenic technologies for recycling radioactive inert gases discharged into the atmosphere is briefly described.

Source term derivation and radiological safety analysis for the TRICO II research reactor in Kinshasa	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							HYPOTHETICAL ACCIDENT	The source term from the 1 MW TRIGA Mark II research reactor core of the Democratic Republic of the Congo was derived in this study. An atmospheric dispersion modeling followed by radiation dose calculation were performed based on two possible postulated accident scenarios. This derivation was made from an inventory of peak radioisotope activities released in the core by using the Karlsruhe version of isotope generation code KORIGEN. The atmospheric dispersion modeling was performed with HotSpot code, and its application yielded to radiation dose profile around the site using meteorological parameters specific to the area under study. The two accident scenarios were picked from possible accident analyses for TRIGA and TRIGA-fueled reactors, involving the case of destruction of the fuel element with highest activity release and a plane crash on the reactor building as the worst case scenario. Deterministic effects of these scenarios are used to update the Safety Analysis Report (SAR) of the reactor, and for its current version, these scenarios are not yet incorporated. Site-specific meteorological conditions were collected from two meteorological stations: one installed within the Atomic Energy Commission and another at the National Meteorological Agency (METTELSAT), which is not far from the site. Results show that in both accident scenarios, radiation doses remain within the limits, far below the recommended maximum effective (whole body) dose of 20 mSv/year for workers and 1 mSv/year for the general public in the IAEA Basic Safety Standards 115 and demonstrate the radiation safety of this reactor. This guarantees the safety of workers and the population around the plant site. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Muswema, J. L.; Ekoko, G. B.; Lukanda, V. M.; Lobo, J.

J	Boulore, A; Aufore, L; Federici, E; Blanpain, P; Blachier, R				Boulore, Antoine; Aufore, Laurence; Federici, Eric; Blanpain, Patrick; Blachier, Remi			Advanced characterization of MIMAS MOX fuel microstructure to quantify the HBS formation	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								Fission gas behaviour in accidental situations is closely related to the location of fission gas before the accident. More precisely, most of the fission gas in intergranular position is released during the accident and HBS zones contribute a lot to this intergranular quantity. So a methodology to characterize the HBS zones a priori from examination of unirradiated pellet has been developed at CEA. Characterization of plutonium distribution in MIMAS MOX fresh fuel pellets can be performed by image analysis on I mm(2) X-ray mappings of plutonium acquired using Electron Probe Micro Analysis (EPMA). The specific software developed to describe the fuel using Pu X-ray mapping (ANACONDA) has been improved in order to simulate the fission products (FP) production and recoil during a given irradiation of the fuel, taking into account the evolution of the plutonium due to neutron irradiation. This simulation results from calculations with our fuel performance code ALCYONE combined with image processing. The final result is a mapping of local burn-up, but also the distribution of the relative FP concentration as a function of the local burn-up. A validation of this simulation process has been done by comparing the simulated mapping of neodymium to one measured on the same fuel batch after irradiation. Using previous studies of mechanisms for HBS formation, a probabilistic criterion for HBS formation has been proposed, based on the EPMA measurements of the decrease of the xenon signal as a function of the local burn-up. Combining the simulated FP cartography with this probabilistic HBS formation criterion, it is possible to calculate the surface fraction of the fuel which will be restructured at a given average burn-up, and the fraction of the total FP contained in these areas. These quantities are given as random variables. This approach has been extended to the whole fuel pellet to take into account the radial distribution of burn-up and the radial distribution of temperature (at high temperature, HBS formation is impossible) using the CEA fuel performance code PLEIADES/ALCYONE. And so, knowing the irradiation history and the initial plutonium repartition of a MOX fuel before irradiation, this methodology allows us to calculate the-total fraction of HBS zones in the pellet, and the associated FP quantity. The application on an experimental fuel pellet (Pu content about 12%) irradiated in the Halden reactor demonstrates that the calculated quantities can be considered as upper bounds for the fission gas release of MOX fuel in accidental situation.

Optimization of temperature coefficient and breeding ratio for a graphite-moderated molten salt reactor	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								Molten salt reactor (MSR) has fascinating features: inherent safety, no fuel fabrication, online fuel reprocessing, etc. However, the graphite moderated MSR may present positive feedback coefficient which has severe implications for the transient behavior during operation. In this paper, the feedback coefficient and the breeding ratio are optimized based on the fuel-to-graphite ratio variation for a thorium based MSR (TMSR). A certain thermal core with negative feedback coefficient and relative high initial breeding ratio is chosen for the reprocessing scheme analysis. The breeding performances for the TMSR under different online fuel reprocessing efficiencies and frequencies are evaluated and compared with other MSR concepts. The results indicate that the thermal TMSR can get a breeding ratio greater than 1.0 with appropriate reprocessing scheme. The low fissile inventory in thermal TMSR leads to a short doubling time and low transuranic (TRU) inventory. The lifetime of graphite used for the TMSR is also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Development of a semi-autonomous directional and spectroscopic radiation detection mobile platform	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article						Gamma-ray detector; Radioactive source localization; Lanthanum bromide; Radiation detection robot; Directionality	CAMERA	This paper presents a method for a small, inexpensive mobile robot equipped with a single high resolution scintillation detector to quickly survey an area and convey information about local sources of gamma radiation to a remote human operator. This is achieved by surrounding the detector with a lead sheath that blocks all gamma-rays except those incident along the detector's axial direction. A 180 horizontal scan is performed by rotating the detector and a directional profile of gamma radiation is constructed. In addition, a 180 visual panorama of the local area is assembled using a camera mounted on the detector. A plot of the detector count rate versus angle is then overlaid on top of the visual panorama and visible peaks clearly indicate the direction of local gamma radiation sources. Measuring the energy spectrum of gamma-rays in each direction produces a 2D count frequency histogram where distinct peaks indicate the energy and direction of local gamma-ray sources allowing the identification of different radio-isotopes. The mobile robot can use the peaks as goal directions and autonomously move towards gamma-ray sources. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether retrospective dosemeters can provide dose estimates with comparable accuracy like conventional personal dosemeters. Using an external source of radiation Cs-137 and an anthropomorphic phantom, we simulated serious irradiation of a human body in anterior-posterior and rotational geometries. Retrospective luminescence dosimetry objects, such as mobile phones, dental ceramic and household salt, and conventional personal dosemeters (thermoluminescent and electronic) were fixed to the anthropomorphic phantom. The doses obtained were compared with specific reference values. In most cases, relative deviations between the measured doses and the reference values did not exceed 20%. As the retrospective and conventional dosemeters show no significant differences in laboratory conditions, the retrospective luminescence dosimetry objects represent a very promising tool if handled properly.

While different types of radiation sensors exist, in recent history, in light of a few catastrophic nuclear melt-downs, the development of sensors with rapid and effective detection properties have become crucial. To probe the feasibility of incorporating such features into the detector architecture, a simple sensor based on mushroom Deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA (Aluminium (Al)/DNA/Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)) was built, and the possibility of employing DNA electronics for the potential detection of alpha particles was investigated. Current voltage (I-V) profiles were obtained following radiation using alpha particles at different dosages and exposure periods at room temperature. Properties such as series resistance, R-S and other properties (barrier height, ideality factor and hypersensitivity) were calculated and analyzed using Conventional, Cheung and Cheung and Norde methods. R-S values of the non-radiated samples calculated using the first method was about 8.6 M Omega. Using Conventional and Norde methods, samples irradiated for 4 min demonstrated the highest R-S values of 5.79 and 1.81 M Omega, respectively. The results obtained were used to demonstrate the possibility of applying the sensitivity of DNA sensors to the measurement of alpha radiation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Surface roughness and spatial variation of the matrix composition make interpretation of broad beam spectra complex and non obvious. We discuss complications of applied IBA arising for fusion-relevant surfaces and demonstrate how quantification can be improved by employing micro IBA methods. The analysis is bound to pre-defined regions on the sample surface and can be extended by employing beams of several types, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and stereo SEM techniques.

Irradiation-induced microstructural evolution was examined by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy. A micro-swelling (lattice expansion) induced by cation ion disordering was observed, which an obvious swelling was achieved at a fluence of 2.0 x 10(16) He+/cm(2), and saturated at a fluence of 1.0 x 10(17) He+/cm(2) with cation ions fully disordered. Furthermore, during the irradiation process, the pristine pyrochlore phase was found to form by a fluence of 5.0 x 10(16) He+/cm(2), corresponding to an average ballistic damage dose of 0.25 displacements per atom (dpa) for the near surface examined region. No amorphization was observed even to the highest fluence of 2.0 x 10(17) He+/cm(2). The experimental observations are further discussed in the context of antisite formation in the pyrochlore Lu2Ti2O7. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Zhang, J.; Yin, D.

Neutrons production in heavy extended targets by electrons of energy from 15 to 1000 MeV	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Neutrons; Electrons; Energy spectra; Spallation targets; MCNPX; FLUKA		We present the results of calculation of energy spectra of the neutrons produced in heavy spallation targets in the form of Pb and W rods by electrons of 200 MeV to 1 GeV energy. The spectra are compared with similar distributions of neutrons generated by 1 GeV protons in the same targets. For electrons in the energy range of 15-240 MeV interacting with Pb and Cu targets our calculated data are also compared with available experimental results. The conclusion is made that the shape of neutrons energy spectra created by both 1 GeV protons and electrons are acceptably comparable below similar to 1 MeV whilst above this value electronuclear neutrons are large enough in number to be used as a spallation neutron source for several aims like transmutation and incineration at least at the experimental level. Moreover, the heat release and remnant radioactivity of investigated targets have also been calculated. All calculations are performed by using MCNPX and FLUKA codes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, the present work proposes the development of a new tool that allows the user to make interactions inside a virtual environment, which simulates the nuclear facility's structure, in order to aid on planning action strategies to improve its security. For such, a virtual model of the Brazilian nuclear research center known as Instituto de Engenharia Nuclear (IEN), located on Ilha do Fundao - Rio de Janeiro was developed. It is defined as a 3D model with a high degree of fidelity to the real environment in which it is based. Inside this model, characters known as avatars can move and interact in real time. Situations that could affect invader's visibility and detection such as natural and artificial illumination, climate and shadows can be represented with realism. In addition, the tool has a virtual CCTV surveillance system that allows environment supervising. Thus, the system makes possible strategies simulation, allowing an evaluation of the performed procedures as well as assisting in the training of security personnel in nuclear and radioactive installations.

Gamma rays were counted by 0.6 cc, Farmer type PTW (TM) Ion chamber. Experimental results were compared with the theoretical values calculated by WinXCom program. Consequently, colemanite addition make enhancement in the radiation shielding of the lightweight concrete, however there is no directly proportional relation between colemanite rate (0.4-2%) and attenuation properties of the lightweight concrete and cure age especially long timed, raises the linear attenuation coefficient and decreases the mean free path values.

The spent radioactive ion exchange resins have been produced during the operation of the nuclear facilities in the nuclear industry. The resins loaded with radioactive nuclides could not be regenerated and reused. These waste resins should be properly treated and disposed in order to minimize their potential hazard to the environments. In this paper, different technologies used for the treatment and disposal of spent radioactive resins were summarized and compared, including immobilization (such as cementation, bituminization and plastic solidification), advanced oxidation processes (such as incineration, pyrolysis, acid boiling degradation, the Fenton or Fenton-like reaction, supercritical water oxidation and plasma technology) and super compaction. Some supplementary methods, such as acid stripping, microbial conversion treatment and high integrity container were also mentioned. The principle of treatment methods, their characteristics and applications were briefly introduced, the future research directions were discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Guo, Q; Chen, ZP; Mao, LF; Dang, TQ; Wang, JY				Guo, Qian; Chen, Zhenping; Mao, Lanfang; Dang, Tongqiang; Wang, Jianye			Preliminary source term and consequence assessment of primary cover gas leakage accident for CLEAR-I	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						CLEAR-I; Primary cover gas leakage; Accident consequence; Individual effective dose	CONCEPTUAL DESIGN; REACTOR; CHINA	China LEAd-based Research Reactor (CLEAR-I) is a 10 MWt research reactor cooled with lead-bismuth. The cover gas system on top of the reactor cavity prevents the coolant from being exposed directly to the air and is important for reactors cooled with liquid metal. We carried out a preliminary analysis of a leakage simulation for the primary cover gas as a design basis accident of CLEAR-I. The radioactive sources and the consequences of release of radioactive material for the population around the reactor were determined. The results show that Xe-133 was the nuclide released in the largest amounts. Release of airborne radioactivity under the simulation conditions resulted in a maximum individual effective whole-body dose of only 6.06 x 10(-6) mSv and a thyroid dose of only 3.54 x 10(-6) mSv for adult, which are six and five orders of magnitude, respectively, lower than the upper limits set in Chinese regulation GB6249-2011. The results indicate that the consequences would be very small for such an accident for CLEAR-I, and no emergency actions would be required. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Analysis of thorium and uranium based nuclear fuel options in Fluoride salt-cooled High-temperature Reactor	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Thorium; Neutronics; FHR	CYCLES	In order to utilize thorium in Fluoride salt-cooled High-temperature Reactor (FHR), neutronics analysis for thorium based fuels (U-233 + Th, U-235 + Th and Pu-239 + Th) is carried out in a whole-core model of pebble bed FHR. Uranium (U-239) based fuels with the above three fissile nuclides are also analyzed for comparison. The atomic density of fissile material is kept constant at start-up for the six fuel types. Neutron characteristics including neutron spectrum, effective multiplicity factor (k(eff)), temperature coefficient of reactivity (TCR), conversion ratio (CR) and burnup for the six fuel options are discussed. With the same fissile nuclide, the thorium based fuels have a higher initial k(eff) than the uranium based fuels due to the smaller resonance absorption of Th-232. As for fissile material, U-233 is the best candidate as a driver fuel in thermal and epithermal spectra due to its effective number of fission neutrons (eta). Besides, the Th-232/U-233 fuel can be extended to radioactive waste management benefited from deeper burnup and lower level of radio-toxicity. The FHR core with thermal and epithermal spectra is more suitable for Th-U fuel cycle than U-Pu fuel cycle. These analyses can provide an approach for the further optimizations of thorium utilization in FHR. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Li, X. X.; Cai, X. Z.; Jiang, D. Z.; Ma, Y.

Advanced plutonium management in PWR, complementarity of thorium and uranium	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Scenario; Steady-state; Plutonium management; PWR; Thorium		The possible delay of decades for the deployment of fourth generation reactors brings up new issues. First, the possibility of higher tension on uranium mining motivates the research of a better use of resources in PWR. Second, countries like France which are storing spent MOX fuels containing plutonium in prediction of starting FBR could have to adapt their plutonium management strategy. Different options and different types of uranium and thorium based fuels in PWR have been studied using the MURE core. The steady-state of all considered strategies is calculated taking into account the whole nuclear cycle, allowing a precise description of the fuel composition and behavior at each step. The study is made in the most similar strategy of fuel reprocessing and allows a real comparison of U and Th cycles. It shows the low breeding capacity of thorium-fuel in PWR that leads to no significant gain on resource consumption. Moreover multireprocessing plutonium on thorium matrix implies to reprocess it in dedicated ThPu assemblies in order to be able to recover U-233. This leads to high plutonium concentrations. The global comparison, that takes into account the whole fleet, between plutonium recycling on depleted uranium or thorium based fuel is then not such favorable for thorium in terms of total plutonium inventories in the fleet at steady state. The same effect is observed for americium production. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Adoption of inert matrix fuels (IMFs) can effectively reduce the amount of Np-237 and Np element in the spent fuel of present-day commercial power reactors. In order to study the burn-up characteristics of IMFs caused by the unique composition, burn-up calculations and MA accumulation of two typical IMFs, PuO2 + ZrO2 + MgO and PuO2 + ThO2, are performed in this paper. Results indicate that k(inf) at beginning of life (BOL) and reactivity drop with burn-up for PuO2 + ZrO2 + MgO are much larger than those of PuO2 + ThO2 IMF. The yields of Np-237 and Np element in IMFs are two orders smaller than those of UO2 and mixed oxide (MOX) fuels. For the same PuO2 volume fraction and a certain burn-up, the masses of Np-237, Np element, and Am-241 for PuO2 + ZrO2 + MgO are smaller than those of PuO2 + ThO2; however, the mass of total MA is larger. IMF has high destruction efficiencies of TRU and plutonium (Pu). The results and conclusion provide basic data for the ongoing IMF design and application study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This double objective conveys the need of very fast neutron spectrum and the use of fuels with a relatively high content of transuranium nuclei, particularly plutonium isotopes. These facts define a narrow design window where a solution must be found to the safety problems created by the lack of Doppler effect and by a strong reduction in the percentage of delayed neutrons. The operational range in safe conditions almost vanishes, because of the lack of negative feedback mechanism and the very small reactivity margin before arriving to prompt-criticality. In order to improve operation conditions, the reactor is kept subcritical, and power level is kept constant with the help of an external source of neutrons, generated by spallations induced by accelerated protons. Main innovations are found in the fuel configuration, because the fuel is embodied into small disks with suitable cladding and different diameters, and the disks are fixed to a geometrical structure forming a virtual spherical surface or cage. The reactor core is therefore a pebble bed, but the pebbles are not actual pebbles, as already said, although they can be evacuated from the core by letting them fall down into a core catcher where subcriticality and decay heat cooling are guaranteed.

The PBMR-400 was designed as a reference core. The neutronic calculations were performed by the code combination MCNP-ORIGEN-MONTEBURNS. In this study, neutronic performances of three different types of nuclear fuels (Reactor Grade Plutonium - RGPu; Weapon Grade Plutonium - WGPu and Minor Actinides - MAs) combined with natural uranium were conducted in a PBMR-400 full core. The neutronic performances were compared with the original uranium fuel designed for this reactor. Neutronic calculations showed that 9.6 wt % enriched uranium has a core effective multiplication factor (k(eff)) of 1.2395. Corresponding to this k(eff) values the natural UO2/RG-PuO2; natural UO2/WG-PuO2 and natural UO2/MAO(2) mixture were found 70%/30%, 76%/24% and 63%/37%, respectively. The operation times were computed as similar to 2000, similar to 2500 and 1400 days whereas, the corresponding burnup values were obtained as similar to 163 000, similar to 194 000 and similar to 116 000 MWD/T, respectively, for end of life k(eff) set equal to 1.08.

The fuel types currently under irradiation are thorium oxide fuel with plutonium as the fissile component, and uranium fuel with thorium as an additive for enhancement of thermo-mechanical and neutronic fuel properties. Fuel temperatures, rod pressures and dimensional changes are monitored on-line for quantification of thermo-mechanical behavior and fission gas release. Preliminary irradiation results show benefits in terms of lower fuel temperatures, mainly caused by improved thermal conductivity of the thorium fuels. In parallel with the irradiation, a manufacturing procedure for thorium-plutonium mixed oxide fuel is developed with the aim to manufacture industrially relevant high-quality fuel pellets for the next phase of the irradiation campaign.

J	Permana, S; Novitrian; Ismail; Suzuki, M; Saito, M				Permana, Sidik; Novitrian; Ismail; Suzuki, Mitsutoshi; Saito, Masaki			Analysis on isotopic plutonium barrier based on spent nuclear fuel of LWR	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Isotopic plutonium; Even mass plutonium; Material barrier; LWR; Burnup; Cooling		Recycling option of spent nuclear fuels (SFN) from the reactors is one of the hot issues in term of fuel utilization of recycling fuel for extending sustainability of nuclear fuel as well as nuclear non-proliferation because of plutonium utilization. The potential risk of plutonium utilization can be reduced by maintaining the isotopic plutonium barrier. Plutonium barrier can be increased by producing more even-mass plutonium isotopes or by increasing the irradiation time process Which can burn much more fissile material in the reactors. The present study intends to analyze some important aspects of isotopic material barrier of plutonium composition based on the composition of spent nuclear fuel of light water reactors (LWRs). Some parameters of material barrier are evaluated such as decay heat (DH) and spontaneous fission neutron (SFN) which depends on plutonium isotopic compositions. The results show that increased production of even-mass plutonium (Pu-238, Pu-240 and Pu-242) can be easily achieved by increasing the burnup level, which also effectively reduces fissile Pu-239 production because more fissile material is consumed. Higher DH from even-mass plutonium can be achieved with higher burnup and longer cooling time because of high contribution of individual decay heat properties of even-mass plutonium especially from Pu-238 contribution. In addition, higher SFN composition can be obtained with a higher burnup level and longer cooling time, which is mainly due to the Pu-240 contribution. Higher bumup and longer cooling time are effective for increasing the even-mass plutonium composition. It is explained that higher irradiation process and cooling times are effective for increasing the proliferation resistance level of plutonium due to the level of even-mass plutonium as well as increasing the decay heat and spontaneous fission neutron as material barrier parameters.

The variation of adsorption process was investigated in batch sorption mode. The parameters studied were pH, contact time and adsorbent dosage. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models were used in order to present a mathematical description of the equilibrium data at three different temperatures (25 degrees C, 35 degrees C and 45 degrees C). The final results confirmed that the equilibrium data tend to follow Freundlich isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacity of Amberlite IRA-402 for uranium(VI) was evaluated to be 213 mg/g for the Langmuir model at 25 degrees C. The adsorption of uranium on the mentioned anion exchange resin was found to follow the pseudo-second order kinetic model, indicating that chemical adsorption was the rate limiting-step. The values of thermodynamic parameters proved that adsorption process of uranium onto Amberlite IRA-402 resin could be considered endothermic (Delta H > 0) and spontaneous (Delta G < 0).

The effect of changing enrichments on core performance	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Low leakage core; Haling Power Depletion; Burnable poisons; Normalized power; Pin peak power; Fuel costs		The information presented in this paper has been developed as a follow on to two previous papers published using the same low leakage core configuration with the addition in this paper of evaluating fuel costs. The two previous publications studied the characteristics of this low leakage core with two different enrichment sets, where each enrichment set represents the three batches in the core. The purpose of the two previous papers proved the effectiveness of using the Haling Power Depletion (HPD) method as a guide. The first purpose of this paper is to extend this study to higher enrichment sets to finally attain a core having close to the highest possible cycle length. Three additional similar enrichment sets are studied increasing the number of enrichment sets to five. The ratio between the enrichment sets was maintained constant except for the highest enrichment set. This was done to increase the cycle length to approximately the longest possible cycle length of 800 days for a 1000 MWe reactor limited to a maximum 5% enrichment. The core reactor physics characteristics of these five cores are presented in this paper together with the evaluating of the fuel costs. These core characteristics include radial power fractions (RPF), Haling Power Depletion, RPF distributions, maximum pin peak powers (PPPMAX), and other important data. The HPD RPFs of all 5 cores were similar and used to help develop the burnable poison placement designs for each core. The longest two cycles required an improved technique using more information than the HPD results to develop successful BP placement designs. Also, it was very difficult to find the correct soluble boron ppmB in the HPD input to have the Studvik HPD calculation converge. There is an error in this algorithm. The fuel costs for the five cores were calculated and the results prove that the fuel costs are lower with the cores having the longest cycle lengths. The details observed in this study are presented in this paper. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Simulation of boiling flow in evaporator of separate type heat pipe with low heat flux	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Spent fuel pool; Flow boiling; VOF; Numerical simulation; Separate heat pipe	2-PHASE FLOW; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; PREDICTION; TRANSITION; PATTERN; DESIGN; ONSET; WATER	The separate type heat pipe heat exchanger is considered to be a potential selection for developing passive cooling spent fuel pool - for the passive pressurized water reactor. This paper simulates the boiling flow behavior in the evaporator of separate type heat pipe, consisting of a bundle of tubes of inner diameter 65 mm. It displays two-phase characteristic in the evaporation section of the heat pipe working in low heat flux. In this study, the two-phase flow model in the evaporation section of the separate type heat pipe is presented. The volume of fluid (VOF) model is used to consider the interaction between the ammonia gas and liquid. The flow patterns and flow behaviors are studied and the agitated bubbly flow, churn bubbly flow are obtained, the slug bubble is likely to break into churn slug or churn froth flow. In addition, study on the heat transfer coefficients indicates that the nucleate boiling is the dominant mechanism in large pipes at low mass and heat flux, with the heat transfer coefficient being less sensitive to the total mass flux.

SINRD is based on the detection of the neutron flux attenuation by Pu-239 around the 0.3 eV neutron resonance, here indicated as the SINRD signature. An effective deployment of the SINRD technique relies on demonstrating that the (PU)-P-239 content in spent fuel can be correlated with the SINRD signature. Previous work from Los Alamos National Laboratory proposed to place a set of fission chambers on one side of the fuel assembly and to detect the passive neutron emission. Since it is expected that in water the signature degrades after a few millimeters from the fuel assembly, a different measurement approach is proposed in our work, namely to insert a set of fission chambers in the guide tubes of the fuel assembly. SCK.CEN conducted a research based on Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the phenomena affecting the SINRD signature. First, we studied the impact of measurement conditions on the energy distribution of the neutron flux at the measurement position. Then, we determined the sensitivity of the SINRD signature to 239PU content. In the final part of our research, we assessed the expected individual impact that other nuclides have on the SINRD signature. We concluded that a better sensitivity is expected when the fuel assembly is in Air, surrounded by a slab of polyethylene. The obtained results also indicated that the ratio between the neutron flux in the fast region and the neutron flux around the 03 eV resonance is more strongly related to the Pu-239 content than other ratios. The impact of U-235 on the SINRD signature was found to be significant, while limited effects were due to other nuclides. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

As much as the unit process development itself, the linkage method between each unit process is also of importance. There may be different linkage options between a set of two process units, or different options caused by different technologies for one of two unit processes connected to each other. The linkage method may affect the loss of nuclear materials and distribution of fission products, which are essential from the safeguards and proliferation resistance points of view. In this study, different technology options for some of the major process steps and possible linkage options were identified, and aspects of their proliferation resistance including the impact on the safeguards are discussed. Several options for decladding and feeding to electro-reduction, dross and the residual salt treatment of reduced materials as well as feeding to electro-refining, and salt transfer from electro-refining to electro-winning were identified and their technical and proliferation resistance aspects were analyzed. This study does not conclude any ranking of each option or suggest which option is the best. It is important to note that the objectives to review the process and linkage options are to give the basic characteristics and technical information related to safeguards measures and proliferation resistance and to suggest a conceptual idea for certain options to investigate further and enhance those aspects.

J	Ragaisis, V; Poskas, P; Simonis, A				Ragaisis, Valdas; Poskas, Povilas; Simonis, Audrius			Methodology for the scoping assessment of radioactive releases during dismantling of RBMK-1500 reactor systems with low-level contamination	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						RBMK type reactor; Ignalina NPP; Radioactive release; Decommissioning; Mass factor	NUCLEAR; PARAMETERS; MANAGEMENT; PROGRESS; NPP	The Ignalina nuclear power plant operated two reactors of the RBMK-1500 type which are now under decommissioning. Decommissioning has been started from the reactor's periphery, with dismantling of non-contaminated and low contaminated equipment and installations. This paper discusses a method for the scoping assessment of airborne radioactive releases to the environment when the number of items of equipment and the variety of installations to be addressed is significant, and separate consideration of each item becomes impractical, especially when the level of radioactive contamination is low. The method is based on the grouping of items into the manageable number of mass streams with particular geometric and other decommissioning-approach-related properties. Radioactive releases are then evaluated by application of "mass factors" that are detailed for two geometric forms - pipes and plates. These forms are the most usual outcomes from Ignalina nuclear power plant decommissioning activities performed on reactor periphery components. The method can be used for the scoping assessment of radio-nuclide releases considering that the radiological impact is expected to be low and, therefore, simple and straightforward solutions are sufficient for demonstration of compliance with the established radiation protection goals.

Samples of debris coming from several FCI tests have been characterized by solid-state analytical techniques. Two kinds of tests have been analyzed: (i) Experiments using simulant materials (MISTEE, PREMIX, ECO FCI experiments) and tests using prototypic corium i.e., in the U-Zr-O system (KROTOS experiments). The nonradioactive melts produce during FCI from negligible amounts of hydrogen up to 3.6 g per kg of melt. It was found that UO2-ZrO2 melt solidifies during FCI into face-centered (Fm3m) crystal cell forming a U1-xZrxO2+y solid solution. The oxygen over-stoichiometry of the solid solution is the evidence of FCR and release of hydrogen. A method combining chemical analysis by Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry (SEM/EDS) and X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD) allowed the determination of the oxygen over-stoichiometry y. Therefore, it has been indirectly estimated how much hydrogen was formed during the chemical reaction between hot corium and water. These data are provided for KROTOS KS2, KS4 and KS5 tests performed in the frame of the OECD/NEA Serena phase-2 project. It has been shown that up to i.e., 4.7 g of H-2 per kg of delivered corium melt can be formed by the reaction stoichiometric or suboxidized UO2-ZrO2 melts with water. The oxygen over-stoichiometry of the U1-xZrxO2+y debris (initially x = 0.48 for KS2; x = 0.35 for KS4; x = 0.38 and y = 0.37 for KS5) varied between 0.107 <= y <= 0.167. The hydrogen formation during FCI is primarily linked to the melt composition and secondary to the size of the fragmented melt droplets. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The approach proposes the use of a tungsten insert marked with a binary code and placed inside the container. The insert is read with a combination of two independent techniques, radiation and ultrasonic measurements, in order to get a unique identification of the cask. Passive and active versions of the tag are considered. The passive version makes use of the radiation coming from the spent nuclear fuel itself. The active version of the tag is based on the use of an artificially introduced mixture of alpha-emitting isotopes, such as Am-241 with materials, B-11 and Na-23, which easily undergo alpha-induced reactions with emission of specific gamma-lines, 2313 key and 1809 keV, respectively. The paper discusses results of the radiation and ultrasonic measurements and Monte-Carlo evaluations as the first proof of the concept. The results of the investigations show the strong potential for this concept to maintain the continuity of knowledge of spent nuclear fuel copper canisters for a time scale up to a few thousands years without compromising the environmental safety of the casks.

This article builds upon the existing research into MSRs to model and simulate the operation of thorium-fueled single-fluid and two-fluid reactors. The analysis is based on neutronics calculations and focuses on denatured MSR systems. Resource utilization and basic proliferation-risk attributes are compared to those of standard light-water reactors. Depending on specific design choices, even fully denatured reactors could reduce uranium and enrichment requirements by a factor of 3-4. Overall, denatured single-fluid designs appear as the most promising candidate technology minimizing both design complexity and overall proliferation risks despite being somewhat less attractive from the perspective of resource utilization.

First estimates using a HTGR presently constructed in China (HTR-PM) conclude that a concentration of approximately 80 mg/kg U in PR is sufficiently high for energy neutral wet acid PR processing with waste treatment and a concentration of approximately 110 mg/kg U is adequate to promote energy intensive high quality thermal phosphoric acid production. In addition, the recovery of U from PRs yields beneficial side-effects in a way that U loads on agricultural soils are reduced and consequently contamination of groundwater with U will be diminished.

Safety, security and safeguard	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Review						Safety; Security; Safeguard; Synergy; Threat; Sabotage		A physical protection system (PPS) integrates people, procedures, and equipment for the protection of assets or facilities against theft, sabotage and terrorist attacks. Therefore, this paper proposes the use of a systematic and measurable approach to the design of PPS and its emphases on the concept of detection, delay and response. The proposed performance based PPS has the capability of defeating adversaries thereby achieving its targets. Therefore, timely detection of intrusion - based on the use of sensors, signal lines and alarm systems - is a major principle in the proposed system. Also the need for deterrence such as barriers in form of guards, access control, close circuit television (CCTV), strong policy and procedures, then the security culture amongst the facility workers was appropriately discussed. Since nuclear power is considered the only source that can provide large scale electricity with comparatively minimal impact on the environment, the paper also considered base guidelines for the application of PPS in any nuclear and radioactive facilities, followed with the necessity to incorporate inherent safety, security and safeguard (3S) synergy innovation in the physical protection system design-and other characteristics that will enhance to reduce the vulnerability of nuclear facilities and materials to theft sabotage and terrorist attacks.

Consequently, the special core configuration with high sensitivity to low introduced reactivity changes was developed at LR-0 reactor. It proved to be suitable for precise definition of any material, in terms of its impact on reactivity, being inserted into a reactor core. The results also imply this kind of core configuration to be applicable for the planed precise measurement of the MSR FLIBE salt temperature reactivity coefficients. This paper also examines the agreement between calculations and experiments for some cases of the low reactivity introduction into the core. Besides that, the similar cores can be used for purposes of neutron dosimetry, therefore the neutron spectrum in the experimental region was determined and compared with the results of MCNP calculations with the standard nuclear data libraries.

J	Wu, X; Kozlowski, T				Wu, Xu; Kozlowski, Tomasz			Coupling of system thermal-hydraulics and Monte-Carlo code: Convergence criteria and quantification of correlation between statistical uncertainty and coupled error	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Monte Carlo; System thermal-hydraulics; Coupled simulation; Uncertainty quantification	LWR	Coupled multi-physics approach plays an important role in improving computational accuracy. Compared with deterministic neutronics codes, Monte Carlo codes have the advantage of a higher resolution level. In the present paper, a three-dimensional continuous-energy Monte Carlo reactor physics burnup calculation code, Serpent, is coupled with a thermal-hydraulics safety analysis code, RELAP5. The coupled Serpent/RELAP5 code capability is demonstrated by the improved axial power distribution of UO2 and MOX single assembly models, based on the OECD-NEA/NRC PWR MOX/UO2 Core Transient Benchmark. Comparisons of calculation results using the coupled code with those from the deterministic methods, specifically heterogeneous multi-group transport code DeCART, show that the coupling produces more precise results. A new convergence criterion for the coupled simulation is developed based on the statistical uncertainty in power distribution in the Monte Carlo code, rather than ad-hoc criteria used in previous research. The new convergence criterion is shown to be more rigorous, equally convenient to use but requiring a few more coupling steps to converge. Finally, the influence of Monte Carlo statistical uncertainty on the coupled error of power and thermal-hydraulics parameters is quantified. The results are presented such that they can be used to find the statistical uncertainty to use in Monte Carlo in order to achieve a desired precision in coupled simulation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigated the effect of non-uniform temperature distribution on the tritium permeation rate through the heat exchanger wall and improved the prediction capability of the existing models by reflecting it. To be more explicit, the effective diffusivity (D-m) and the effective temperature (T-m) was newly defined for the heat exchanger wall, and the effective weight (x(eff)) was derived from one-dimensional diffusion equation. Based on the data collected by numerical methods, an empirical correlation for xeff was developed by a linear regression method and it was validated by comparisons with randomly generated separate numerical solutions. As a result, the new permeation model based on the effective temperature (T-eff) showed very good agreement with the numerical results within an error of 1.28% on average while the existing model based on the average wall temperature (T-m) showed large discrepancies exceeding 200% in the maximum error. This study concludes that the newly developed tritium permeation model significantly improves the prediction capability on the tritium permeation rate through the heat exchangers. Which is the main tritium transport path in the high temperature reactor and the integrated industrial process systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, the multi-cycle core was designed in order to increase thorium utilization and TRU waste transmutation. For that purpose, the reprocessed fuel assemblies inside the subcritical core are shuffled for twice burnt while the thorium assemblies are remained inside the reactor until the end of reactor life. As the result, at the equilibrium state, the thorium fuel contribution to total core power is improved (35.7%) compared to the startup cycle and it has benefit in flattening the power peaking inside the subcritical core. Compare to the startup cycle, less reprocessed fuel is loaded but the reprocessed assemblies are shuffled and burnt twice, hence, the TRUs are transmuted in a deeper level. At discharge, the reduction of radiotoxicity from the TRU waste is about 20% with 1% uncertainty, mainly due to the reduction of Pu and Am. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Al Saadi, S; Yi, YS				Al Saadi, Sara; Yi, Yongsun			Dry storage of spent nuclear fuel in UAE - Economic aspect	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Nuclear fuel cycle; Dry storage; Economic analysis		Cost analysis of dry storage of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) discharged from Barakah nuclear power plants in the UAE was performed using three variables: average fuel discharge rate (FD), discount rate (d), and cooling time in a spent fuel pool (T,001). The costs of dry storage as an interim spent fuel storage option in the UAE were estimated and compared between the following two scenarios: Scenario 1 is 'accelerated transfer of spent fuel to dry storage' that SNF will be transferred to dry storage facilities as soon as spent fuel has been sufficiently cooled down in a pool for the dry storage; Scenario 2 is defined as 'maximum use of spent fuel pool' that SNF will be stored in a pool as long as possible till the amount of stored SNF in the pool reaches the capacity of the pools and, then, to be moved to dry storage. A sensitivity analysis on the costs was performed and multiple regression analysis was applied to the resulting net present values (NPVs) for Scenarios 1 and 2 and Delta NPV that is difference in the net present values between the two scenarios. The results showed that NPVs and Delta NPV could be approximately expressed by single equations with the three variables. Among the three variables, the discount rate had the largest effect on the NPVs of the dry storage costs. However, Delta NPV was turned out to be equally sensitive to the discount rate and cooling period. Over the ranges of the variables, the additional cost for accelerated fuel transfer (Scenario 1) ranged from 86.4 to 212.9 million $. Calculated using the maximum difference (212.9 M$) between the two scenarios, the accelerated fuel transfer to dry storage could incur the additional electricity rate 8.0 x 10(-5) USD/kWh, which is not considered to be significant, compared to the overall electricity generation cost.

Conceptual design of a passively safe thorium breeder Pebble Bed Reactor	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Pebble Bed Reactor; Thorium; Breeding; Passive safety; Transients		More sustainable nuclear power generation might be achieved by combining the passive safety and high temperature applications of the Pebble Bed Reactor (PBR) design with the resource availability and favourable waste characteristics of the thorium fuel cycle. It has already been known that breeding can be achieved with the thorium fuel cycle inside a Pebble Bed Reactor if reprocessing is performed. This is also demonstrated in this work for a cylindrical core with a central driver zone, with 3 g heavy metal pebbles for enhanced fission, surrounded by a breeder zone containing 30 g thorium pebbles, for enhanced conversion. The main question of the present work is whether it is also possible to combine passive safety and breeding, within a practical operating regime, inside a thorium Pebble Bed Reactor. Therefore, the influence of several fuel design, core design and operational parameters upon the conversion ratio and passive safety is evaluated. A Depressurized Loss of Forced Cooling (DLOFC) is considered the worst safety scenario that can occur within a PBR. So, the response to a DLOFC with and without scram is evaluated for several breeder PBR designs using a coupled DALTON/THERMIX code scheme. With scram it is purely a heat transfer problem (THERMIX) demonstrating the decay heat removal capability of the design. In case control rods cannot be inserted, the temperature feedback of the core should also be able to counterbalance the reactivity insertion by the decaying xenon without fuel temperatures exceeding 1600 C. Results show that high conversion ratios (CR > 0.96) and passive safety can be combined in a thorium PBR within a practical operating regime, which means a thermal power of 100 MW or higher, 1000 days total residence time of the breeder pebbles and fuel pebble handling times longer than 14.5 s, like in the HTR-PM. With an increased U-233 content of the fresh driver pebbles (18 w%), breeding (CR = 1.0135) can already be achieved for a 220 cm core and 80 cm driver zone radius. While the decay heat removal is sufficient in this design, the temperature feedback of the undermoderated driver pebbles is too weak to compensate the reactivity insertion due to the xenon decay during a DLOFC without scram. With a lower U-233 content per driver pebble (10 w%) it was found possible to combine breeding (CR = 1.0036) and passive safety for a 300 cm core and 100 cm driver zone radius, but this does require more than a doubling of the pebble handling speed and a high reprocessing rate of the fuel pebbles. The maximum fuel temperature during a DLOFC without scram was simulated to be 1481 C for this design, still quite a bit below the TRISO failure temperature. The maximum reactivity insertion due to an ingress of water vapour is also limited with a value of +1497 pcm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Wols, F. J.; Kloosterman, J.

J	Foad, B; Takeda, T				Foad, Basma; Takeda, Toshikazu			Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis for UO2 and MOX fueled PWR cells	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Sensitivity; Uncertainty; IR approximation; Self-shielding; PWR	COEFFICIENTS	This paper discusses the improvement of a method for calculating sensitivity coefficients of neutronics parameters relative to infinite dilution cross-sections because the conventional method neglects resonance self-shielding effect. In this study, the self-shielding effect is taken into account by using the intermediate resonance approximation in order to get accurate results in both high and low energy groups. The improved method is applied to calculate sensitivity coefficients and uncertainties of eigenvalue responses for UO2 and MOX (ThO2-UO2 and PuO2-UO2) fueled pressurized water reactor cells. The verification of the improved method was performed by comparing the sensitivities with MCNP6 and TSU-NAMI-1D. For uncertainty, calculation comparisons were done with TSU-NAMI-1D, and we demonstrate that the differences are caused by the use of different covariance matrices. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Radiocarbon mass balance for a Magnox nuclear power station	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Magnox reactors; Carbon-14; Graphite; Activation modelling		Nuclear power generation in the United Kingdom is based principally on graphite-moderated gas-cooled reactors. The mass of irradiated graphite associated with these reactors, including material from associated experimental, prototype and plutonium production reactors, exceeds 96,000 tonnes. One of the principal long-lived radionuclides produced during graphite irradiation is radiocarbon (C-14). Its potential as a hazard must be taken into account in decommissioning and graphite waste management strategies. While C-14 production processes are well-understood, radionuclide distributions and concentrations need to be characterised. A common misconception is that generic statements can be made about C-14 precursors and their location. In fact, the composition of the original manufactured material, the chemical environment of the graphite during service and its irradiation history will all influence C-14 levels. The analysis presented here provides the first assessment of the principal C-14 activation pathways for a UK Magnox reactor. Activation modelling has been used to predict C-14 production rates in both the graphite core and the carbon dioxide coolant over a selected period of operation and the results compared with monitoted site C-14 discharges. Principal activation routes have been identified, which should inform future graphite waste management strategies relating to radiocarbon. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Metcalfe, M.

Austenitic type 310 (310SS) and 304 stainless steels, ferritic Fe-20Cr-5Al (FeCrAl) and APMT (TM) alloys, and silicon carbide (SiC)-based materials were considered and compared with Zircaloy-4. SCALE 6.1 was used to analyze the associated neutronics penalty/advantage, changes in reactivity coefficients, and spectral variations once a transition in the cladding was made. In the cases examined, materials containing higher absorbing isotopes invoked a reduction in reactivity due to an increase in neutron absorption in the cladding. Higher absorbing materials produced a harder neutron spectrum in the fuel pellet, leading to a slight increase in plutonium production. A parametric study determined the geometric conditions required to match cycle length requirements for each alternate cladding material in a PWR. A method for estimating the end of cycle reactivity was implemented to compare each model to that of standard Zircaloy-4 cladding. By using a thinner cladding of 350 mu m and keeping a constant outer diameter, austenitic stainless steels require an increase of no more than 0.5 wt% enriched U-235 to match fuel cycle requirements, while the required increase for FeCrAl was about 0.1%. When modeling SiC (with slightly lower thermal absorption properties than that of Zircaloy), a standard cladding thickness could be implemented with marginally less enriched uranium (similar to 0.1%). Moderator temperature and void coefficients were calculated throughout the depletion cycle. Nearly identical reactivity responses were found when coolant temperature and void properties were perturbed for each cladding material. By splitting the pellet into 10 equal areal sections, relative fission power as a function of radius was found to be similar for each cladding material. FeCrAl and 310SS cladding have a slightly higher fission power near the pellet's periphery due to the harder neutron spectrum in the system, causing more Pu-239 breeding. An economic assessment calculated the change in fuel pellet production costs for use of each cladding. Implementing FeCrAl alloys would increase fuel pellet production costs about 15% because of increased U-235 enrichment and the additional UO2 pellet volume enabled by using thinner cladding.

Parameterized representation of macroscopic cross section for PWR reactor	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Cross-section; Parameterized cross-sections; Chebyshev polynomials; Fuel burnup	REGRESSION	The purpose of this work is to describe, by means of Chebyshev polynomials, a parameterized representation of the homogenized macroscopic cross section for PWR fuel element as a function of soluble boron concentration, moderator temperature, fuel temperature, moderator density and U-235(92) enrichment. The cross-section data analyzed are fission, scattering, total, transport, absorption and capture. The parameterization enables a quick and easy determination of problem-dependent cross-sections to be used in few group calculations. The methodology presented in this paper will allow generation of group cross-section data from stored polynomials to perform PWR core calculations without the need to generate them based on computer code calculations using standard steps. The results obtained by the proposed methodology when compared with results from the SCALE code calculations show very good agreement. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Separation of cyclotron-produced Sc-44 from a natural calcium target using a dipentyl pentylphosphonate functionalized extraction resin	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Sc-44; Scandium-44; PET; Radioisotope production; Radiochemical separation; Radiometal; Radiolabeling	IN-VIVO; PET; RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS; RADIONUCLIDE; STABILITY; COMPLEXES	Significant interest in Sc-44 as a radioactive synthon to label small molecules for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has been recently observed. Despite the efforts of several research groups, the ideal Sc-44 production and separation method remains elusive. Herein, we propose a novel separation method to obtain Sc-44 from the proton irradiation of calcium targets based on extraction chromatography, which promises to greatly simplify current production methodologies. Using the commercially available Uranium and Tetravalent Actinides (UTEVA) extraction resin we were able to rapidly ( < 20 min) recover >80% of the activity generated at end of bombardment (EoB) in small similar to 1 M HCl fractions (400 mu L). The chemical purity of the Sc-44 eluates was evaluated through chelation with DOTA and DTPA, and by trace metal analysis using microwave induced plasma atomic emission spectrometry. The distribution coefficients (K-d) of Sc(III) and Ca(II) in UTEVA were determined in HCI medium in a range of concentrations from zero to 12.1 M. The Sc-44 obtained with our method proved to be suitable for the direct labeling of small biomolecules for PET imaging, with excellent specific activities and radiochemical purity.

Elemental composition in sealed plutonium-beryllium neutron sources	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Sealed PuBe neutron source; ICP-MS; ICP-AES; Plutonium assay; Beryllium assay; Trace elements	ICP-MS; NEPTUNIUM; ASSAY	Five sealed plutonium-beryllium (PuBe) neutron sources from various manufacturers were disassembled. Destructive chemical analyses for recovered PuBe materials were conducted for disposition purposes. A dissolution method for PuBe alloys was developed for quantitative plutonium (Pu) and beryllium (Be) assay. Quantitation of Be and trace elements was performed using plasma based spectroscopic instruments, namely inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Pu assay was accomplished by an electrochemical method. Variations in trace elemental contents among the five PuBe sources are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
