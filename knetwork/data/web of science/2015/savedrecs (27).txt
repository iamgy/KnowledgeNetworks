NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE COST ESTIMATION AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF UNIT COSTS ON THE BASIS OF AN EQUILIBRIUM MODEL	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Deterministic method; Direct disposal; Equilibrium model; Nuclear fuel cycle cost; Probabilistic method; Pyroprocess; Pyro-SFR fuel cycle; Uncertainty; Unit cost		This paper examines the difference in the value of the nuclear fuel cycle cost calculated by the deterministic and probabilistic methods on the basis of an equilibrium model. Calculating using the deterministic method, the direct disposal cost and Pyro-SFR (sodium-cooled fast reactor) nuclear fuel cycle cost, including the reactor cost, were found to be 66.41 mills/kWh and 77.82 mills/kWh, respectively (1 mill = one thousand of a dollar, i.e., 10(-3) $). This is becauae the cost of SFR is considerably expensive. Calculating again using the probabilistic method, however, the direct disposal cost and Pyro-SFR nuclear fuel cycle cost, excluding the reactor cost, were found be 7.47 mills/kWh and 6.40 mills/kWh, respectively, on the basis of the most likely value. This is because the nuclear fuel cycle cost is significantly affected by the standard deviation and the mean of the unit cost that includes uncertainty. Thus, it is judged that not only the deterministic method, but also the probabilistic method, would also be necessary to evaluate the nuclear fuel cycle cost. By analyzing the sensitivity of the unit cost in each phase of the nuclear fuel cycle, it was found that the uranium unit price is the most influential factor in determining nuclear fuel cycle costs.

In the current study, neutronic assessment of UO2 in comparison with two (Th-U-233)O-2, and (Th-U-235)O-2 thorium-based fuel loads in a heavy water research reactor has been proposed. The obtained computational data showed both thorium-based fuels caused less negative temperature reactivity coefficients for the modeled research reactor in comparison with UO2 fuel loading. By contrast, U-233-containing thorium-based fuel and U-235-containing thorium-based fuel loadings in the thermal core did not drastically reduce the effective delayed neutron fractions and delayed neutron fractions compared to UO2 fuel. A provided higher conversion factor and lower transuranic production in the research core fed by the thorium-based fuels make the fuel favorable in achieving higher cycle length and less dangerous and costly nuclear disposals.

The LSDS system currently under development at the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (Daejeon, Korea) is planned to utilize a high-flux (>10(12) n/cm(2).s) neutron source comprised of a high-energy (30 MeV)/high-current (similar to 2 A) electron beam and a heavy metal target, which results in a very intense and complex radiation field for the facility, thus demanding structural shielding to guarantee the safety. Optimization of the structural shielding design was conducted using MCNPX for neutron dose rate evaluation of several representative hypothetical designs. In order to satisfy the construction cost and neutron attenuation capability of the facility, while simultaneously achieving the aimed dose rate limit (<0.06 mu Sv/h), a few shielding materials [high-density polyethylene (HDPE)-Borax, B4C, and Li2CO3] were considered for the main neutron absorber layer, which is encapsulated within the double-sided concrete wall. The MCNP simulation indicated that HOPE-Borax is the most efficient among the aforementioned candidate materials, and the combined thickness of the shielding layers should exceed 100 cm to satisfy the dose limit on the outside surface of the shielding wall of the facility when limiting the thickness of the HOPE-Borax intermediate layer to below 5 cm. However, the shielding wall must include the instrumentation and installation holes for the LSDS system. The radiation leakage through the holes was substantially mitigated by adopting a zigzag-shape with concrete covers on both sides. The suggested optimized design of the shielding structure satisfies the dose rate limit and can be used for the construction of a facility in the near future.

One goal of this technique is to achieve good precision in a short measurement time. In this paper, we describe a procedure to derive mass assay variance for multiplicity counting based on the three-parameter model, and analytical equations are established using the measured neutron multiplicity distribution. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to evaluate precision versus plutonium mass under a fixed measurement time with the equations. Experimental data of seven weapons-grade plutonium samples are presented to test the expected performance. This variance analysis has been used for the counter design and optimal gate-width setting at Institute of Nuclear Physics and Chemistry.

A novel tritium monitor system including an open-walled ionization chamber, an electrometer and an IPC (Industrial Personal Computer) has been developed to measure tritium in gaseous form. Using mesh walls, instead of sealed wall, the open-walled ionization chamber has less tritium absorption and lower memory effect. In addition, tritium gas can diffuse into the chamber's sensitive region without the assistant of sampling system and ion trap, which are installed at the front-end of commonly used flow-through ionization chambers. Background signal of this monitor system is about 3.7 x 10(5) Bq/m(3), and after exposed to tritium concentration at about 10(11) Bq/m(3) for 4h, background of the monitor can recover after purging it several times with dry air. It is suitable for longtime tritium measurements in both glovebox and workplace.

This technique is derived from the proton-proton scattering technique and has been proven to have the same beneficial features, namely a detection limit below 1 wt-ppm and a depth resolution better than 1 mu m. The method gives absolute quantitative information about H or D content in atoms per cm(2) and does not depend on the structure, chemical environment or other so called "matrix effects". This work presents an evaluation of the developed technique through measurements on unique material from samples from the Tagish Lake meteorite, which has been suggested to be one of the most primitive solar system materials yet studied.

J	Skubacz, K				Skubacz, Krystian			Measurements of low doses with Panasonic dosimeters. Algorithm and tests	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article						UD-813; UD-802; Thermoluminescence; Low doses; Mixed fields; Algorithm	DETECTORS	The Panasonic TLD system utilises a number of dosimeters designated for different dosimetry tasks and most of them are used to evaluate doses in mixed radiation fields in personal and environmental dosimetry. As in other similar systems the results are often only input data that are used to evaluate the correct doses. The firmware provided does not offer the possibility of performing statistical analysis, and that is especially important where there are low doses. This article contains a description of an algorithm developed in The Silesian Centre for Environmental Radioactivity for dose calculations, evaluation of the corresponding measurement uncertainties and finally the critical levels and lower limits of detection. The algorithm was also applied to derive component signals associated with a particular type of radiation, and then to evaluate the necessary calibration factors, taking into account the calibration dose. Finally it was used to check the measurement capabilities of UD-813 Panasonic dosimeters that are primarily designed to evaluate the dose of neutron radiation. The application of the algorithm is possible for other types of dosimeters, for example UD-802. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sources can be abandoned, lost or stolen. If they are stolen, they could be used to cause deliberate harm and the risks are varied and significant. There is a need for a global security protection system and enhanced capability to achieve this. The establishment of radioactive source security requires 'cultural exchanges'. These exchanges include collaboration between: radiation protection specialists and security specialists; the nuclear industry and users of radioactive sources; training providers and regulators/users. This collaboration will facilitate knowledge and experience exchange for the various stakeholder groups, beyond those already provided. This will promote best practice in both physical and information security and heighten security awareness generally. Only if all groups involved are prepared to open their minds to listen to and learn from, each other will a suitable global level of control be achieved.

Some of these facilities were built and operated before the regulatory infrastructure was in place to ensure adequate control of radioactive material during operation and decommissioning. In other cases, controls were in place but did not meet modern standards, leading to what is now considered to have been inadequate control. Accidents and other events have occurred resulting in loss of control of radioactive material and unplanned releases to the environment. The legacy from these circumstances is that many countries have areas or facilities at which abnormal radiation conditions exist at levels that give rise to concerns about environmental and human health of potential interest to regulatory authorities. Regulation of these legacy situations is complex. This paper examines the regulatory challenges associated with such legacy management and brings forward suggestions for finding the path from: legacy recognition; implementation, as necessary, of urgent mitigation measures; development of a longer-term management strategy, through to release from regulatory control.

This case was carefully followed until 2013. Since no decorporation measures had been taken, the undisturbed metabolism of Pu and Am can be derived from the data. First objective was to determine the amount of inhaled radionuclides and to estimate committed effective dose. In vivo and excretion measurements started immediately after the inhalation, and for quality assurance, all types of measurements were performed by different labs in Europe and the USA. After dose assessment by various international groups were completed, the measurements were continued to produce scientific data for model validation. The data have been analysed here to estimate lung absorption parameter values for the inhaled plutonium and americium oxide using the proposed new ICRP Human Respiratory Tract Model. As supplement to the biokinetic modelling, biological data from three different cytogenetic markers have been added. The estimated committed effective dose is in the order of 1 Sv. The subject is 30 y after the inhalation, of good health, according to a recent medical check-up.

This paper sketches out the technical and administrative aspects and highlights a recent review of the biosphere effects of a potential release from the repository. A comprehensive database and an understanding of major fluxes and pools of water and organic matter in the landscape let one envisage the future by looking at older parts of the site. Thus, today's biosphere is used as a natural analogue of possible future landscapes. It is concluded that the planned repository can meet the safety criteria and will have no detectable radiological impact on plants and animals. This paper also briefly describes biosphere work undertaken after the review. The multidisciplinary approach used is relevant in a much wider context and may prove beneficial across many environmental contexts.

The side-product of this activity is the radioactive waste, which is mainly generated as a result of preventive and corrective maintenance, upgrading activities and the dismantling of experiments or accelerator facilities. Prior to treatment and disposal, it is common practice to temporarily store radioactive waste on CERN's premises and it is a legal requirement that these storage facilities are safe and secure. Waste treatment typically includes sorting, segregation, volume and size reduction and packaging, which will depend on the type of component, its chemical composition, residual activity and possible surface contamination. At CERN, these activities are performed in a dedicated waste treatment centre under the supervision of the Radiation Protection Group. This paper gives an overview of the radiation protection challenges in the conception of a temporary storage and treatment centre for radioactive waste in an accelerator facility, based on the experience gained at CERN. The CERN approach consists of the classification of waste items into 'families' with similar radiological and physical-chemical properties. This classification allows the use of specific, family-dependent techniques for radiological characterisation and treatment, which are simultaneously efficient and compliant with best practices in radiation protection. The storage was planned on the basis of radiological and other possible hazards such as toxicity, pollution and fire load. Examples are given of technical choices for the treatment and radiological characterisation of selected waste families, which could be of interest to other accelerator facilities.

In 2007, ASN set up a system for the notification of radiation protection events. The majority of them concern the exposure of patients undergoing therapeutic or diagnostic procedures and, to a lesser extent, occupational exposures and the management of radioactive effluents. The most significant events concern interventional radiological procedures and nuclear medicine, in which there are exceedances of mandatory dose limits and staff contaminations, respectively. Deterministic effects in patients were observed following interventional procedures and in nuclear medicine. Many events involve leakage of radioactive effluents and highlight the need to improve the monitoring and maintenance of radioactive effluent facilities. The causes are mainly of organisational and human origin. The lessons learned emphasise the importance of the role of medical physicists and radiation protection officers and the need to implement quality and risk management measures and to conduct clinical audits.

A review of the results from the German Wismut uranium miners cohort	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th European Congress of the International-Radiation-Protection-Association (IRPA)	JUN 23-27, 2014	Geneva, SWITZERLAND	Int Radiat Protect Assoc			LUNG-CANCER RISK; IONIZING-RADIATION; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASES; MORTALITY; RADON; EXPOSURE; LEUKEMIA; SILICA; DUST; SMOKING	The Wismut cohort is currently the largest single study on the health risks associated with occupational exposures to ionising radiation and dust accrued during activities related to uranium mining. The cohort has similar to 59 000 male workers, first employed between 1946 and 1989, at the Wismut Company in Germany. The main effect is a statistically significant increase in mortality from lung cancer with both increasing cumulative radon exposure and silica dust exposure. Risks for cancers of the extrathoracic airways, all extra-pulmonary cancers and cardiovascular diseases associated with radiation exposures have been evaluated. Cohort mortality rates for some other cancer sites, stomach and liver, are statistically significantly increased in relation to the general population, but not statistically significantly related to occupational exposures. No associations between leukaemia mortality and occupational doses of ionising radiation were found.

Units related to radiation exposure and radioactivity in mass media: the Fukushima case study in Europe and Russia	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th European Congress of the International-Radiation-Protection-Association (IRPA)	JUN 23-27, 2014	Geneva, SWITZERLAND	Int Radiat Protect Assoc			RISK COMMUNICATION; PERCEPTION; KNOWLEDGE	Using an analysis of the way European newspapers covered the Fukushima nuclear accident, this article explores how the mass media transmit information about radiation risks from experts to the general public. The study applied a media content analysis method on a total of 1340 articles from 12 leading newspapers in 6 countries: Belgium (N = 260), Italy (N = 270), Norway (N = 133), Russia (N = 172), Slovenia (N = 190) and Spain (N = 315). All articles analysed were selected as being directly or indirectly related to the Fukushima accident by containing the word 'nuclear' and/or 'Fukushima' and were published between the 11th March and the 11th May 2011. The data presented here focus specifically on a cross-cultural comparison of the way the media use quantitative units. Results suggest that although experts are accustomed to communicating about radiological risks in technical language, often using quantitative units to describe the risks, mass media do not tend to use these units in their reporting. Although the study found a large variation in the measurement units used in different countries, it appeared that journalists in all the analysed countries preferred to describe radioactivity by comparing different radiation exposures, rather than reporting the actual measured units. The paper concludes with some practical guidelines for sound public communication about radiation risks.

J	van Dillen, T				van Dillen, Teun			SUDOQU: a new dose model to derive criteria for surface contamination of non-food (consumer) goods, containers and conveyances	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th European Congress of the International-Radiation-Protection-Association (IRPA)	JUN 23-27, 2014	Geneva, SWITZERLAND	Int Radiat Protect Assoc				The Fukushima nuclear accident (Japan, 11 March 2011) revealed the need for well-founded criteria for surface contamination and associated screening levels related to the import of non-food (consumer) goods, containers and conveyances. The only available European-harmonised criteria are those laid down in the IAEA transport regulations, but these criteria date back from the early 1960s and only apply to the safe transport of radioactive materials. The main problem is that a generic dose-assessment model for consumer products is missing. Therefore, RIVM (National Institute for Public Health and the Environment) developed a new methodology entitled SUDOQU (SUrface DOse QUantification) to calculate the annual effective dose for both consumers and non-radiological workers, addressing issues of removability of surface contamination. The methodology can be used to derive criteria and screening levels for surface contamination and could serve as a useful tool for policy-makers and radiation-protection specialists.

A general problem of hydrometallurgical reprocessing of spent carbide fuel is the formation of plutonium complexes with water-soluble organic compounds of an acidic nature, which are formed when such fuel dissolves in nitric acid. The drawbacks of the proposed methods of decomposing organic compounds include the possibility of secondary precipitation and reduction of the extractability of multivalent actinides, long-time limitations in choosing the structural materials of the equipment, and incomplete decomposition of organic compounds. Often, the solutions obtained are unsuitable for direct extractive reprocessing because of the need to remove corrosive reagents or their inorganic residues, which increases the volume of secondary wastes.

Release of Nitrogen Oxides into the Gas Phase Accompanying the Dissolution of Uranium Nitride in Nitric Acid	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The release of nitrogen oxides (N2O, NO, NO2) accompanying the dissolution of UN in HNO3 with concentration 3-16 mol/liter and the ratio S:L = 1:7.5 and in 7.2 mol/liter HNO3 with S:L varying from 3 to 30 in atmospheric air or argon is studied. In the indicated HNO3 concentration range N2O is formed mainly as a result of the oxidation of UN and secondarily as a result of the reduction of HNO3. The presence or absence of oxygen in the atmosphere has no effect on the amount of N2O formed. The formation of NO2 is due to the reduction of HNO3. The presence of oxygen increases the amount of NO2 formed as a result of the oxidation of NO. The amount of nitrogen monoxide NO released into atmospheric air is higher than the amount released into an argon atmosphere. The amount of NO formed increases with increasing nitric acid concentration. The release of nitrogen oxides from UN as well as from nitric acid results in considerable dilution of nitride nitrogen, which casts doubt on the possibility of recycling N-15 in the case where (UN)-N-15 is used as fuel.

Obtaining a Diluent for High-Enrichment Uranium in a Double Cascade	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								A scheme for producing a diluent for high-enrichment uranium in a double cascade is examined. The marketable product, viz., low-enrichment uranium, is obtained in the product flow of the first cascade; the diluent is obtained in the product flow of the second cascade from the waste flow of the first cascade. To reduce the cost of the separative work performed on the production of all products it is proposed that the feed point for the first cascade be displaced in the direction of the product flow relative to the optimum, calculated from the condition of optimization of the cascade for the production of U-235. A computational experiment shows this scheme to be efficient and the particularities associated with the use of natural uranium and depleted wastes as initial materials.

In case of the unplanned (potential) accidents there are extremely large uncertainties of the model predictions for crop contamination and dose due to many factors affecting the Organically Bound Tritium (OBT) dynamics in crops. A full mechanistic model is difficult to develop due to the complexity of the processes involved in tritium transfer and the environmental conditions. The preparatory steps for a robust model are discussed in the present study, considering the role of the thy matter and photosynthesis contributing to the OBT dynamics in crops.

Therefore, the capture and exchange method for HTW utilizing Molecular Sieve Beds (MSB) was investigated in view of adsorption capacity, isotopic exchange performance and process parameters. For the MSB, different types of zeolite were selected. All zeolite materials were additionally platinized The following work comprised the selection of the most efficient zeolite candidate based on detailed parametric studies during the H-2/D2O laboratory scale exchange experiments (similar to 25 g zeolite per bed) at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK). For the zeolite, characterization analytical techniques such as Infrared Spectroscopy, Thermogravimetry and online mass spectrometry were implemented. Followed by further investigation of the selected zeolite catalyst under fill technical operation, a MSB (similar to 22 kg zeolite) was processed with hydrogen flow rates up to 60 mol h(-1) and deuterated water loads up to 1.6 kg in view of later ITER processing of arising HTW.

The process is an elemental isotope exchange process in which H-2 (when flowed through the molecular sieves) will exchange with the adsorbed water, D2O, leaving H2O adsorbed on the molecular sieves. Various formulations of catalyzed molecular sieve material were prepared using two different techniques, Pt-implantation and Pt-ion exchange. This technology has been demonstrated for a protium (H) and deuterium (D) system, but can also be used for the removal of tritium from contaminated water (T2O, HTO, and DTO) using D-2 (or H-2).

A conventional way to recover tritium release to atmosphere is catalytic oxidation of tritiated species and adsorption of tritated water vapor on adsorbents with high surface areas. However, pressure loss would become more serious with increase in the size of adsorbent beds, which could lead to greater power needs for ventilation systems. Therefore, new adsorbents with low pressure loss and high surface areas need to be developed and utilized for such large-scale adsorption systems. Thus, the authors tested new types of adsorbents, which are gear-type and honeycomb-type pellet adsorbents. The experimental results reveal that the gear-type pellet adsorbents have larger adsorption capacity than the honeycomb-type pellet adsorbent. It was also found that the gear-type MS4A adsorbent possesses larger adsorption capacity than other adsorbents tested in this work. Furthermore, it was found that new types of adsorbents are lower pressure than conventional-type of adsorbents. Among the new adsorbents studied in this work, the gear-type MS4A adsorbent appears to be most promising for the application to the adsorption systems in terms of adsorption capacity and adsorption rate.

For in-situ measurements of high level tritiated water by bremsstrahlung counting, the characteristics of a low-noise silicon drift detector (SDD) have been examined at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK). In static measurements with constant sample volume and tritium concentration, the bremsstrahlung spectra of tritiated water samples in a concentration range of 0.02 to 15 MBq/ml have been observed. The volume has been kept constant at 5 cm(3). The observed spectra are well above the noise threshold. In addition to X-rays induced by beta-rays, the spectra feature X-ray fluorescence peaks of the surrounding materials. No indications of memory effects have been observed. A linear relation between the X-ray intensity and the tritium concentration was obtained and the lower detection limit of the setup has been determined to I MBq ml(-1), assessed by the Currie criterion. In addition, the spectra obtained experimentally could be reproduced with high agreement by Monte-Carlo simulations using the Geant4-toolkit. It was found that the present detection system is applicable to non-invasive measurements of high-level tritiated water and the SDD is a convenient tool to detect the low energy bremsstrahlung X-rays.

Hydrogen produced by water corrosion of alpha Fe is trapped and/or blocked in/by product oxide layers to delay hydrogen uptake in alpha Fe for a moment. However, the oxide layers do not work as a sufficient barrier for hydrogen uptake. Some of hydrogen dissolved in alpha Fe could normally diffuse and permeate through the alpha Fe bulk. Assuming hydrogen dissolution at the water/Fe interface proportional to the square root of the hydrogen pressure (Sieverts' law), the partial hydrogen pressure were estimated to be 0.7, 5.0 and 9.5 kPa at 303, 323 and 348 K, respectively.

The C+ implanted W, WC and HOPG were prepared and dynamic sputtered particles were measured during H-2(+) irradiation. It was found that the major hydrocarbon species for C+ implanted tungsten was found to be CH3, although those for WC and HOPG were CH4. The chemical state of hydrocarbon is controlled by the H concentration in a W-C mixed layer. The amount of C-H bond and the retention of H trapped by carbon atom should control the chemical form of hydrocarbon sputtered by H-2(+) irradiation and the desorption of CH3 and CH2 was due to chemical sputtering, although that for CH was physical sputtering. The activation energy for CH3 desorption was estimated to be 0.4 eV, corresponding to the trapping process of hydrogen by carbon through the diffusion in W It was concluded that the chemical states of hydrocarbon sputtered by H-2(+) irradiation for W was determined by the amount of C-H bond on the W surface.

As the experimental results of the dependence of both dissolved oxygen and tritium concentration on the anodic behavior of chromium, it was found that the self-passivation of chromium induced by dissolved oxygen was inhibited in the tritiated solution, as found in the previous studies for SUS304 stainless steel. Therefore, it was considered that the elution of chromium by highly oxidative radiolysis products would induce a passivation inhibitory effect onto SUS304 stainless steel in a tritiated solution, resulting in an enhancement of the corrosion.

Tritium monitoring is performed using tritium-in-air gas monitoring instrumentation based either on flow-through ion chambers or proportional counting systems. Tritium-in-air monitors are typically calibrated in dry conditions but in service may operate at elevated levels of relative humidity. The NPL radioactive gas-in-air calibration system has been used to study the effect of humidity on the response to tritium of two tritium-in-air ion chamber based monitors and one proportional counting system which uses a P10/air gas mixture. The response of these instruments to HTO vapour has also been evaluated In each case, instrument responses were obtained for HT in dry conditions (RH similar to 2%), HT in 45% Relative Humidity (RH), and finally HTO at 45% RH. Instrumentation response to HT in humid conditions has been found to slightly exceed that in dry conditions.

Many of the waste products contain organic materials which may undergo degradation leading to the release of tritium and carbon-14 species into waste containers and potentially into the environment. Monitoring for radioactive gas releases are required for environmental regulatory compliance and for radiation protection of facility workers. Research is currently being undertaken at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) as part of a European Metrology Research Programme (EMRP) project MetroRWM to adapt and automate existing environmental sampling techniques for tritium and carbon-14 species. An innovative modular system is being developed which will lead to the introduction of an on-site small scale system capable of gas collection, liquid scintillation sample preparation and measurement. This paper outlines the evaluation of a liquid scintillation system that has been performed to date using active solutions of spiked trapping medium of similar activity concentrations to those anticipated in a waste repository. This system will operate using pre-set conditions for quench and luminescence derived from these and subsequent trials, unlike most other counters for which corrections for these phenomena are applied post measurement.

The availability target for a hypothesized Fuel Cycle has been analysed as a test case. The analysis has been done on the basis of the experience gained in operating existing tokamak fusion reactors and developing the ITER design. Plant Breakdown Structure (PBS) and Functional Breakdown Structure (FBS) related to the DEMO Fuel Cycle and correlations between PBS and FBS have been identified. At first, a set of availability targets has been allocated to the various systems on the basis of their operating, protection and safety functions. 75% and 85% of availability has been allocated to the operating functions of fuelling system and tritium plant respectively. 99% of availability has been allocated to the overall systems in executing their safety functions. The chances of the systems to achieve the allocated targets have then been investigated through a Failure Mode and Effect Analysis and Reliability Block Diagram analysis. The following results have been obtained: i) the target of 75% for the operations of the fuelling system looks reasonable, while the target of 85% for the operations of the whole tritium plant should be reduced to 80%, even though all the tritium plant systems can individually reach quite high availability targets, over 90% - 95%; ii) all the DEMO Fuel Cycle systems can reach the target of 99% in accomplishing their safety functions.

In the work presented, a stress test of a Leybold (R) MAG W2800 with a tritium throughput of 1.1 kg over 384 days of operation was performed at TLK. After this, the pump was dismantled and the tritium uptake in several parts was determined. Especially the non-metallic parts of the pump absorb large amounts of tritium and are most likely responsible for the observed pollution of the process gas. The total tritium uptake of the TMP was estimated with 0.1-1.1 TBq. No radiation-induced damages were found on the inner parts of the pump. The TMP showed no signs of functional limitations during the 384 days of operation.

The compliancy with the ITER interface requirements, in terms of space availability, service fluids, limits on tritium release, constraints on maintenance, is driving the design of the TBS tritium processing systems. Other requirements come from the characteristics of the relevant TBM and the scientific programme that has to be developed and implemented. This paper identifies the main requirements for the design of the TBS tritium systems and equipment and, at the same time, provides an updated overview on the current design status, mainly focusing onto the tritium extractor from Pb-16Li and TBS tritium accountancy. Considerations are also given on the possible extrapolation to DEMO breeding blanket.

Raman spectroscopy provides a fast and contact-free gas analysis procedure with high precision, thus being an advantageous tool for the named purpose. In this paper, it is shown that the sensitivity achieved with conventional Raman systems (in 90 degrees or forward/backward configurations) can be enhanced by at least one order of magnitude by using a metal-lined hollow glass fiber as the Raman cell. This leads to the ability to detect low partial pressures of tritium within short measurement intervals (< 0.5 mbar in < 0.5 s).

It was found that two major deuterium desorption stages were observed at the temperature regions of 400 - 700 K (Stage 1) and 900 - 1100 K (Stage 2), considering that Stage I was linked to the desorption of deuterium trapped by near surface and intrinsic defects, and Stage 2 was related to the desorption of deuterium bound to impurities as C-D bonds. By heating the sample above 673 K, the major peak of C-1s was shifted from C-O bond to C-C bond, where the retention of deuterium as Stage 2 was increased. Therefore it was indicating that the hydrogen isotope retention was controlled by the amount of C-C bond in VPS, most of which was contaminated during the VPS coating process. The comparison of several samples (VPS-W with shading, VPS-W without shading and Polycrystalline W (PCW)) shows that the carbon impurity has a large affinity with deuterium and make stable trapping states compared to that with intrinsic defects and grain boundaries. However, most of them was reduced by heating at 1173 K Therefore, heating treatment is quite important to get rid of carbon impurities and refrain higher tritium retention in VPS.

This deficit can be overcome by using radioluminescence emission from helium atoms induced by beta-electrons from tritium decay. We present theoretical considerations and combined Raman/radioluminescence spectra. Furthermore, we discuss the linearity of the method together with validation measurements for determining the pressure dependence. Finally, we conclude how this technique can be used for samples of helium with traces of tritium, and vice versa.

Small-scale tritium testing indicates that this method is efficient for reaching an exchange factor (EF) of 100. Full-scale non-tritium testing implies that an EF of 300 can be achieved in 24 hours of operation if a temperature gradient is applied along the column. For the isotopic exchange, deuterium recycled from the Isotope Separation System (deuterium with 1% T and/or 200 ppm T) should be employed, and the tritiated water regenerated from the Pt-catalyzed zeolite bed after isotopic exchange should be transferred to Water Detritiation System (WDS) for further processing.

Indian Lead Lithium cooled Ceramic Breeder Test Blanket Module (LLCB-TBM) would extract hydrogen isotopes through Cryogenic Molecular Sieve Bed (CMSB) adsorber system. A prototype Hydrogen Isotopes Recovery System (HIRS) is being developed to validate the concepts for tritium extraction by adsorption mass transfer mechanism.In this study, a design model has been developed and analyzed to simulate the adsorption mass transfer kinetics in a fixed bed adsorption column. The simulation leads primarily to effective design of HIRS, which is a state-of-the-art technology. The paper describes the process simulation approach and the results of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis. The effects of different operating conditions are studied to investigate their influence on the hydrogen isotopes adsorption capacity. The results of the present simulation study would be used to understand the best optimized transport phenomenon before realizing the TES as a system for LLCB-TBM	[Devi, V.

In the design of TBM tritium systems of China, the safety design of common chemistry engineering system and tritium safety design are considered at the same time. It is necessary to avoid a continuous increase of the tritium concentration in the coolant and to reduce the tritium permeation into the secondary coolant as well as environment. In this paper, the design and tritium permeation analysis of China HCCB TBM port cell are introduced. At first, the primary design considerations of the system are given to fulfill the engineering demand of the ordinary system (non radioactive system). Then the tritium permeation, the release analysis, the effect of tritium release to the people and environment are discussed. From the calculation of the tritium permeation in the systems housed in the port cell, tritium permeation barrier is needed in the higher temperature components such as the reduction bed and the heater.

THERMAL RELEASE OF He-3 FROM TRITIUM AGED LaNi4.25Al0.75 HYDRIDE	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 21-25, 2013	Nice Acropolis Congress Ctr, Nice Acropolis, FRANCE	CEA, Irfm, VILLE DE NICE, Iter, SDEC, Premium Analyse, MBRAUN	Nice Acropolis Congress Ctr			Recently, the demand for He-3 has increased dramatically due to widespread use in nuclear nonproliferation, cryogenic, and medical applications. Essentially all of the world's supply of He-3 is created by the radiolytic decay of tritium. The Savannah River Site Tritium Facilities (SRS-TF) utilizes LANA.75 in the tritium process to store hydrogen isotopes. The vast majority of He-3 "born" from tritium stored in LANA.75 is trapped in the hydride metal matrix. The SRS-TF has multiple LANA.75 tritium storage beds that have been retired from service with significant quantities of He-3 trapped in the metal. To support He-3 recovery, the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) conducted thermogravimetric analysis coupled with mass spectrometry (TGA-MS) on a tritium aged LANA.75 sample. TGA-MS testing was performed in an argon environment. Prior to testing, the sample was isotopically exchanged with deuterium to reduce residual tritium and passivated with air to alleviate pyrophoric concerns associated with handling the material outside of an inert glovebox. Analyses indicated that gas release from this sample was bimodal, with peaks near 220 and 490 degrees C. The first peak consisted of both He-3 and residual hydrogen isotopes, the second was primarily He-3. The bulk of the gas was released by 600 degrees C.
