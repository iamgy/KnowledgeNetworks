To satisfy, fueling requirement of fusion machine, rapid delivery from metal hydride bed is one of major factors for the development of tritium storage and delivery system. Desorption from metal hydride depends on the operation scenario by pressure and temperature control of the bed The effect of operation scenario and pump performance on desorption rate of metal hydride bed was experimentally investigated using ZrCo bed. The results showed that the condition of pre-heating scenario before actual delivery of gas affected the delivery performance. Different pumps were connected to desorption line from bed and the effect of pump capacity on desorption rate were also found to be significant.

COMPARATIVE TESTING OF VARIOUS FLOW-CELL DETECTORS FABRICATED USING CAF(2) SOLID SCINTILLATOR	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 21-25, 2013	Nice Acropolis, FRANCE					A monitoring system based on a flow-cell detector was developed for measuring the tritium concentration in water. The flow-cell detector was fabricated using a granular CaF2 solid scintillator. This system does not use a liquid scintillation cocktail and does not generate radioactive organic liquid waste. Moreover, continuous real-time measurements are possible, in contrast to a liquid scintillation counting system, which requires batch measurements. For further development of the system, four flow-cell detectors were fabricated. They included a single 3-mm-diameter cell, three 3-mm-diameter cells in series, a single 5-mm-diameter cell, and three 5-mm-diameter cells in series. Continuously flowing water containing tritium at various concentrations was passed through the flow cells, and tritium count were measured for 600 and 10000 s. Investigating the relation between the count rate and concentration, the three 5-mm-diameter cells were most sensitive, with a linear relation maintained down to approximately 2 Bq/mL and 10 Bq/mL for 10000- and 600-s measurements, respectively.

A URANIUM BED WITH CERAMIC BODY FOR TRITIUM STORAGE	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 21-25, 2013	Nice Acropolis, FRANCE				DEUTERIUM PERMEATION; BARRIER; BEHAVIOR; MANET	Tritium permeation through structural materials is a key issue in many activities linked with tritium handling both for radiological safely and accountancy reasons to say nothing of economical aspect: tritium is not the cheapest material in the world. It is widely recognized that ceramic coatings provide an attractive solution to lower tritium permeation in structural materials. Alumina based ceramic coatings have the highest permeation reduction factor for hydrogen. Nevertheless even small cracking will significantly spoil the permeation reduction factor of a protecting coating. Nowadays for hydrogenating neutron tube targets with tritium "VNIIA" uses working chambers manufactured by pressing of alumina based ceramics. These chambers have revealed extremely low hydrogen permeation upon conditions of their application. For this reason an attempt was made to apply low porous ceramics as a structural material of a bed body for tritium storage in a setup used for hydrogenating neutron tube targets at "VNIIA". The present article introduces the design of the bed. This bed possesses essentially less hydrogen permeation factor than traditionally used beds with stainless steel body. Bed heating in order to recover hydrogen from the bed is suggested to be implemented by high frequency induction means. Inductive heating allows decreasing the time necessary for tritium release from the bed as well as power consumption. Both of these factors mean less thermal power release into glove box where a setup for tritium handling is installed and thus causes fewer problems with pressure regulations inside the glove box. Inductive heating allows raising tritium sorbent material temperature up to melting point. The latter allows achieving nearly full tritium recovery.

INERT BLANKETING OF A HYDRIDE BED USING TYPICAL GRADE PROTIUM	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 21-25, 2013	Nice Acropolis, FRANCE				URANIUM; TRITIUM	The reduction in hydride absorption rate due to "blanketing" can be explained in terms of a reduced hydrogen partial pressure in the bed due to the accumulation of inerts (i.e. non-hydrogen isotopes) in the bed void volume. Literature results show reduced absorption rates when protium for bed absorption contains helium with low-end inert compositions in the 0.6 to 1% range. A hydride bed containing 9.66 kg of LaNi4.25Al0.75 (LANA0.75) metal hydride - a nominal capacity of 1400 STP-L, was cycled repeatedly to decrepitate the hydride material into smaller particles for bed strain measurement. The hydride cycles added and removed nominally 1000 to 1100 STP-L of protium per hydride cycle. Consistent and repeatable absorptions results were observed for different absorption cycles. During one of the absorption tests, slower absorption results were obtained due to the use of typical grade (500 ppm inerts), instead of research grade, protium which blanketed the bed. The impact of 0.05% inerts in protium on bed absorption rate is shown and explained in terms of an increase in inert partial pressure as the bed was loaded	Savannah River Natl Lab, Aiken, SC 29808 USA	Klein, JE (reprint author), Savannah River Natl Lab, Aiken, SC 29808 USA.	james.klein@srnl.doe.gov			U.S. Department of Energy [DEAC09-08SR22470]	The authors would like to thank Jody Dye for her contributions to this work.

TRITIUM ACCOUNTANCY IN FUSION SYSTEMS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 21-25, 2013	Nice Acropolis, FRANCE					The US Department of Energy (DOE) has clearly defined requirements for nuclear material control and accountability (MC&A) of tritium whereas the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) does not since tritium is not a fissile material. MC&A requirements are expected for tritium fusion machines and will be dictated by the host country or regulatory body where the machine is operated Material Balance Areas (MBAs) are defined to aid in the tracking and reporting of nuclear material movements and inventories. Material sub-accounts (MSAs) are established along with key measurement points (KMPs) to further subdivide a MBA to localize and minimize uncertainties in the inventory difference (ID) calculations for tritium accountancy. Fusion systems try to minimize tritium inventory which may require continuous movement of material through the MSAs. The ability of making meaningful measurements of these material transfers is described in terms of establishing the MSA structure to perform and reconcile ID calculations. For fusion machines, changes to the traditional ID equation will be discussed which includes breading, burn-up, and retention of tritium in the fusion device. The concept of "net" tritium quantities consumed or lost in fusion devices is described in terms of inventory taking strategies and how it is used to track the accumulation of tritium in components or fusion machines.

A LOW TRITIUM HYDRIDE BED INVENTORY ESTIMATION TECHNIQUE	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 21-25, 2013	Nice Acropolis, FRANCE				PACE BED; ACCOUNTABILITY	A nominal 1500 STP-L Passively Cooled, Electrically heated hydride (PACE) Bed was developed and deployed into tritium service in Savannah River Site (SRS) Tritium Facilities. Process beds to be used for low concentration tritium gas were not fitted with instrumentation to perform the steady-state, flowing gas calorimetric inventory measurement method: In-Bed Accountability (IBA). In some instances, two physical beds, or canisters, were joined together with one process line connection, creating a bed with a total capacity of nominally 3000 STP-L or up to 815 grams of tritium. The IBA detection limit for these beds was estimated to be 9.75 grams tritium. After deployment of these low tritium beds, the need arose to estimate tritium inventories of these beds without installation of IBA instrumentation. Two methods have been developed to estimate the tritium inventory of these low tritium content beds. The first approach assumes the bed is half-full and uses a gas composition measurement to estimate the tritium inventory and uncertainty. The second approach utilizes the bed's hydride material pressure-composition-temperature (PCT) properties and a gas composition measurement to reduce the uncertainty in the calculated bed inventory.

In future the vacuum vessel will be treated as non-radioactive ones after the clearance procedure under the Japanese regulation depending on the tritium (T) contamination level. Note that the vessel was manufactured from Inconel 625 steel. Therefore, it was very important to study the hydrogen isotope behavior in Inconel 625 from viewpoint of the clearance procedure. Inconel 625 specimen was exposed to the D-2 (92.8 %) T-2 (7.2 %) gas mixture at 573 K for 5 hours. The tritium release from the specimen at 298 K was controlled for about I year. After that a part of tritium remaining in the specimen was released by heating up to 1073 K Other part of tritium trapped in the specimen was measured by chemical etching method. Most of the chemical form of the released tritium was HTO. The contaminated specimen by tritium was released continuously the diffusible tritium under the ambient condition. In the tritium release experiment, the amount of desorbed tritium was about 99% during I year. It was considered that the tritium in Inconel 625 was released easily. From these results, the behavior of tritium in the vacuum vessel of the JT-60U torus will be evaluated and discussed.

FORTHCOMING REVISION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY TRITIUM HANDLING AND SAFE STORAGE GUIDE	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 21-25, 2013	Nice Acropolis, FRANCE					Once every five years, the US. Department of Energy (DOE) requires, via DOE Order (O) 252.1A, Technical Standards Program, that each of its Standards and Handbooks undergo a maintenance review (also known as "sunset reviews'). There are three possible outcomes of a maintenance review: (I) reaffirmation as current, accurate, and of continuing value to the Department; (2) revision to be current, accurate, and of continuing value; or (3) cancellation. DOE-HDBK-1129-2008, Tritium Handling and Safe Storage, is following option (2) above; the required justification of continuing value was demonstrated by a lack of comparable technical breadth and depth available in other publications. This paper gives an overview of the updates that the Tritium Handling and Safe Storage Guide will undergo. It is expected that the update will be completed in early 2014.

To develop nuclear fusion technology, it will be necessary to store and supply hydrogen isotopes needed for Tokamak operation. SDS is used for storing hydrogen isotopes as a metal hydride form. We designed and fabricated a small-scale getter bed of zirconium cobalt (ZrCo). The rapid hydriding of tritium is very important not only for safety reasons but also for the economic design and operation of the SDS. The effect of the initial absorption temperatures on the hydriding of ZrCo was measured and analyzed. The experimental results of the hydrogen pressure of hydriding (ZrCoH2.8) at various cooling temperatures are in agreement with the calculated values using numerical modeling equations. The effect of a helium blanket on hydriding was measured and analyzed. The experimental results of the hydriding with 0 %, 4%, and 8% of helium concentration are in agreement with the calculated values based on numerical modeling equations.

LIMITATION OF TRITIUM OUTGASSING FROM TRITIATED SOLID WASTE DRUMS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 21-25, 2013	Nice Acropolis, FRANCE				WATER-VAPOR; ADSORPTION	In the framework of the development of fusion thermonuclear reactors, tritiated solid waste is foreseen and will have to be managed. In France, the long-term management of all radioactive waste is under the responsibility of the national waste management agency (ANDRA), which sets out strict specifications on waste drums before their acceptances in disposal. Among all these specifications, the related ones for tritium concern limitations in terms of activity and tritium degassing. The latter is the subject of research developments to improve its control. The degassing tritium can be under the form of tritiated hydrogen, tritiated water and, in some specific cases, negligible amount of tritiated volatile organic compound. Hence, considering the major forms of degassing tritium, CEA has developed a mixed-compound dedicated to tritium trapping in drums. Based on several experiments, the foreseen mixed compound is composed of MnO2, Ag2O, Pt and molecular sieve, the three first species having the ability to convert tritiated hydrogen into tritiated water and the last one acting as a trap for tritiated water. This paper aims at describing the formulation of the mixed solids compound and presenting the first results of experimental lab-scale tests performed on purely tritiated waste confined in a small reactor. It is observed that the rate of tritium degassing from the reactor is reduced drastically during several months by means of the presence of the mixed compound.

The impact of hydrogen and radiogenic helium on mechanical properties of CrNi35WTiAl alloy was determined by tensile tests of cylindrical samples in inert and hydrogen atmospheres. For this research samples with various concentrations of 3 He (90, 230 and 560 appm) were prepared. The buildup of 3 He has been fulfilled using the "tritium trick" technique. Maximal influencing of hydrogen and radiogenic helium on mechanical properties of CrNi35WTiAl was observed at 873 K on samples with 560 appm of He-3.

Understanding tritium permeation behavior through F82H is important. In a normal operation of a fusion reactor, the temperature of F82H will be controlled below 550 degrees C because it is considered that F82H can be used up to 30,000 hours at 550 degrees C. However, it is necessary to assume the situation where F82H is heated over 550 degrees C in a severe accident. In this study, hydrogen permeation behavior through F82H was investigated in the temperature range from 500 degrees C to 800 degrees C. In some cases, water vapor was added in a sample gas to investigate an effect of water vapor on hydrogen permeation. The permeability of hydrogen in the temperature range from 500 degrees C to 700 degrees C agreed well with the permeability reported by E. Serra et al. The degradation of the permeability by water vapor was not observed. After the hydrogen permeation reached in a steady state at 700 degrees C, the F82H sample was heated to 800 degrees C. The permeability of hydrogen through F82H sample which was once heated up to 800 degrees C was lower than that of the original one.

Uncertainty induced by chest wall thickness assessment methods on lung activity estimation for plutonium and americium: a large population-based study	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article						lung monitoring; americium; plutonium; efficiency; uncertainty	FEMALE WORKERS; EQUATIONS; EFFICIENCY; DETECTORS; PHANTOMS	In vivo lung counting aims at assessing the retained activity in the lungs. The calibration factor relating the measured counts to the worker's specific retained lung activity can be obtained by several means and strongly depends on the chest wall thickness. Here we compare, for 374 male nuclear workers, the activity assessed with a reference protocol, where the material equivalent chest wall thickness is known from ultrasound measurements, with two other protocols. The counting system is an array of four germanium detectors. It is found that non site-specific equations for the assessment of the chest wall thickness induce large biases in the assessment of activity. For plutonium isotopes or Am-241 the proportion of workers for whom the retained activity is within +/- 10% of the reference one is smaller than 10%. The use of site-specific equations raises this proportion to 20% and 58% for plutonium and Am-241, respectively. Finally, for the studied population, when site-specific equations are used for the chest wall thickness, the standard uncertainties for the lung activity are 42% and 12.5%, for plutonium and Am-241, respectively. Due to the relatively large size of the studied population, these values are a relatively robust estimate of the uncertainties due to the assessment of the chest wall thickness for the current practice at this site.

The ICRP-recommended biokinetic model for strontium has limitations for use in a population study, because it is not gender specific and does not cover all age ranges. The extensive Techa River data set on Sr-90 in humans (tens of thousands of measurements) is a unique source of data on long-term strontium retention for men and women of all ages at intake. These, as well as published data, were used for evaluation of age-and gender-specific parameters for a new compartment biokinetic model for strontium (Sr-AGe model). The Sr-AGe model has a similar structure to the ICRP model for the alkaline earth elements. The following parameters were mainly re-evaluated: gastrointestinal absorption and parameters related to the processes of bone formation and resorption defining calcium and strontium transfers in skeletal compartments. The Sr-AGe model satisfactorily describes available data sets on strontium retention for different kinds of intake (dietary and intravenous) at different ages (0-80 years old) and demonstrates good agreement with data sets for different ethnic groups. The Sr-AGe model can be used for dose assessment in epidemiological studies of general populations exposed to ingested strontium radioisotopes.	[Shagina, N. B.; Tolstykh, E. I.; Degteva, M.

US Transuranium and Uranium Registries case study on accidental exposure to uranium hexafluoride	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article						uranium hexafluoride; slightly enriched uranium; autopsy tissue analysis; biokinetic modelling; lung dissolution	CALCULATING BAYESIAN UNCERTAINTIES; YORK-CITY RESIDENTS; OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURES; INTERNAL DOSIMETRY; BIOKINETIC MODEL; DRINKING-WATER; INHALATION; CLEARANCE; RETENTION; INGESTION	The United States Transuranium and Uranium Registries' (USTUR) whole-body donor (Case 1031) was exposed to an acute inhalation of uranium hexafluoride (UF6) produced from an explosion at a uranium processing plant 65 years prior to his death. The USTUR measurements of tissue samples collected at the autopsy indicated long-term retention of inhaled slightly enriched uranium material (0.85% U-235) in the deep lungs and thoracic lymph nodes. In the present study, the authors combined the tissue measurement results with historical bioassay data, and analysed them with International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) respiratory tract models and the ICRP Publication 69 systemic model for uranium using maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistical methods. The purpose of the analysis was to estimate intakes and model parameter values that best describe the data, and evaluate their effect on dose assessment. The maximum likelihood analysis, which used the ICRP Publication 66 human respiratory tract model, resulted in a point estimate of 79 mg of uranium for the occupational intake composed of 86% soluble, type F material and 14% insoluble, type S material. For the Bayesian approach, the authors applied the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, but this time used the revised human respiratory tract model, which is currently being used by ICRP to calculate new dose coefficients for workers. The Bayesian analysis estimated that the mean uranium intake was 160 mg, and calculated the case-specific lung dissolution parameters with their associated uncertainties. The parameters were consistent with the inhaled uranium material being predominantly soluble with a small but significant insoluble component. The 95% posterior range of the rapid dissolution fraction (the fraction of deposited material that is absorbed to blood rapidly) was 0.12 to 0.91 with a median of 0.37. The remaining fraction was absorbed slowly, with a 95% range of 0.000 22 d(-1) to 0.000 36 d(-1) and a median of 0.000 31 d(-1). The effective dose per unit intake calculated using the dissolution parameters derived from the maximum likelihood and the Bayesian analyses was higher than the current ICRP dose coefficient for type F uranium by a factor of 2 or 7, respectively; the higher value of the latter was due to use of the revised respiratory tract model. The dissolution parameter values obtained here may be more appropriate to use for radiation protection purposes when individuals are exposed to a UF6 mixture that contains an insoluble uranium component.

J	Vervecken, L; Camps, J; Meyers, J				Vervecken, Lieven; Camps, Johan; Meyers, Johan			Dynamic dose assessment by Large Eddy Simulation of the near-range atmospheric dispersion	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article						dose assessment; dispersion; Large Eddy Simulation; atmospheric boundary layer	MINE VENTILATION SHAFT; PLUME DISPERSION; TURBULENT-FLOW; VICINITY	In order to improve the simulation of the near-range atmospheric dispersion of radionuclides, computational fluid dynamics is becoming increasingly popular. In the current study, Large-Eddy Simulation is used to examine the time-evolution of the turbulent dispersion of radioactive gases in the atmospheric boundary layer, and it is coupled to a gamma dose rate model that is based on the point-kernel method with buildup factors. In this way, the variability of radiological dose rate from cloud shine due to instantaneous turbulent mixing processes can be evaluated. The steady release in an open field of Ar-41 and Xe-133 for 4 different release heights is studied, thus covering radionuclides that decay with a high-energy gamma and a low-energy gamma, respectively. Based on these simulations, the variability of dose rates at ground level for different averaging times in the dose measurements is analyzed. It is observed that turbulent variability in the wind field can lead to dose estimates that are underestimated by up to a factor of four when conventional long-term measurements are used to estimate the dose from short-term exposures.

The goal was to measure the energy-integrated neutron-induced capture cross section in three different neutron spectra (from pressurized water reactor-like to undermoderated ones). This paper summarizes the combined deterministic APOLLO2 and stochastic TRIPOLI4 analysis using the JEFF-3.1.1 European nuclear data library. Very good agreement is observed for most neutron-induced capture cross sections of actinides except for a clear underestimation of Am-241(n,gamma). An accurate value of its associated isomeric branching ratio is also suggested. A resonant fluctuation (factor of 2.7 between the two available excited levels regarding the l = 0 total orbital momenta) is suggested for this isomeric branching capture ratio. Finally, a precise value (more accurate than the reported JEFF-3.1.1 one) of the decay branching ratio of Am-242g(beta(+)/epsilon) is deduced: 0.171 +/- 0.001.

Integrated Nondestructive Assay Systems to Estimate Plutonium in Spent Fuel Assemblies	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							MEASUREMENT ERROR; REGRESSION; MODELS	An integrated nondestructive assay (NDA) system combining active (neutron generator) and passive neutron detection and passive gamma (PG) detection is being analyzed in order to estimate the amount of plutonium, verify initial enrichment, burnup, and cooling time, and detect partial defects in a spent fuel assembly (SFA). Active signals are measured using the differential die-away (DDA), delayed neutron (DN), and delayed gamma (DG) techniques. Passive signals are measured using total neutron (TN) counts and both gross and spectral resolved gamma counts. To quantify how a system of several NDA techniques is expected to perform, all of the relevant NDA techniques listed above were simulated as a function of various reactor conditions such as initial enrichment, burnup, cooling time, assembly shuffling pattern, reactor operating conditions (including temperature, pressure, and the presence of burnable poisons) by simulating the NDA response for five sets of light water reactor assemblies. This paper compares the performance of several exploratory model-fitting options (including neural networks, adaptive regression with splines, iterative bias reduction smoothing, projection pursuit regression, and regression with quadratic terms and interaction terms) to relate data simulated with measurement and model error effects from various subsets of the NDA techniques to the total Pu mass. Isotope masses for SFAs and expected detector responses (DRs) for several NDA techniques are simulated using MCNP, and the DRs become inputs to the fitting process. Such responses include eight signals from DDA, one from DN, one from TN, and up to seven from PG; the DG signal will be examined separately. Results are summarized using the root-mean-squared estimation error for plutonium mass in held-out subsets of the data for a range of model and measurement error variances. Different simulation assumptions lead to different spent fuel libraries relating DRs to Pu mass. Some results for training with one library and testing with another library are also given.

J	Hollenbach, DF				Hollenbach, D. F.			Bounding Parameters of a Theoretical Deep-Earth Uranium Fission Reactor	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							NUCLEAR-FISSION; GEOMAGNETIC-FIELD; CORE; GABON	More than 50 years ago it was postulated that a naturally occurring nuclear reactor was possible if it started 2 billion years ago. The subsequent discovery of the natural reactor at Oklo confirmed that it is possible for a nuclear fission reactor to naturally form and cycle on and off over extended periods of time. The hypothesis of a naturally occurring reactor was extended to include the possibility of significant quantities of uranium aggregating inside the molten core of Earth due to gravity during its formation. When sufficient quantities of uranium accumulate, a self-sustaining fission reactor could form, which would fluctuate in power as uranium fissions and fission products are produced. Lighter elements would migrate out of the reactor region, and heavier elements would coalesce due to gravity. In this technical note, SCALE, a state-of-the-art nuclear engineering computer code system developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, was used to investigate this hypothesis. The analysis indicates that the overall operational parameters of a postulated nuclear fission reactor located in the inner core of Earth must fall within a relatively narrow band in order to still be operating today. If the overall power level were too low, the reactor would not breed sufficient fissile material, and the average enrichment would drop below the level required to form a self-sustained fast reactor. If the power level were too high, the reactor would have burned itself out well before the present day. The objective of this technical note is to provide calculations that support an existing geo-reactor and the operating parameters that would govern a deep-Earth reactor and allow it to still be operating today, 4.5 billion years after Earth was formed. To help bound the possible power range, a simplified, one-dimensional, homogeneous, deep-Earth reactor having a steady-state fission power is simulated over geologic time. Power levels and start times are varied. The simulations show that if the reactor were still operating today, it would have an overall lifetime average operating fission power of <3 TW. Analyses show that both instantaneous and cumulative He-3/He-4 ratios are a function of fission power, U-235/U-238 ratio, total uranium mass, and geo-reactor starting time. The calculated He-3/He-4 ratios are consistent with those observed in nature.

Neutron Yield of the Reaction (alpha, n) on Thick Targets Comprised of Light Elements	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article							PRODUCTION CROSS-SECTIONS; REACTION-RATES; NA-23(ALPHA,N)AL-26 REACTIONS; ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS; BOMBARDING ENERGY; THRESHOLD; MG-26(P,N)AL-26; SPECTRA; S-33	Accurate data on the neutron yield from the interaction of alpha-particles with the nuclei of light elements ranging from lithium to potassium are required for solving the problems of nuclear power technologies: development of analytical means for controlling the technological processes of fabricating and reprocessing nuclear fuel, securing radiological protection for workers, improving the systems for managing and monitoring nuclear materials and radioactive wastes, measuring the burnup fraction of spent nuclear fuel, and others. The uncertainty of this information must be < 10% for energies ranging from 4 to 9 MeV of alpha-particles emitted by naturally occurring and artificial radionuclides. The computational uncertainty of the neutron yield can be reduced on the basis of a combined analysis of (alpha, n) reactions, measured on alpha-particle accelerators with tunable energy and on compounds of actinides with light elements, using reliable data on the stopping power of alpha-particles for elements from hydrogen to californium. The results of such an analysis based on experimental and evaluated data for the light isotopes Li-6, Li-7, Be-9, B-10, B-11, C-13, N-14, O-17, O-18, Ne-21, Ne-22, F-19, Na-23, Mg-25, Mg-26, Al-27, Si-29, Si-30, P-31, S-33, S-34, Cl-35, Cl-37, and K-41 in the alpha-particle energy range from 4 to 9 MeV are presented.

J	Jackel, BS				Jaeckel, Bernd S.			Status of the spent fuel in the reactor buildings of Fukushima Daiichi 1-4	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								The ratios of the radionuclides Cs-134g and Cs-137 deduced from measurements of liquid samples from the spent fuel pools in Fukushima Daiichi 1-4 are used to interpret the status of the spent fuel assemblies in the pools of the damaged reactor buildings. The different natures of the production of Cs-134g (neutron capture product of Cs-133) and Cs-137 (cumulative fission product from mass chain 137) and the different half-lives (2.06 years and 30.17 years respectively) require a complicated calculation of the mass and activity of the two nuclides. These masses are depending on the local burn up of the fuel, the burn up history and the radioactive decay. Calculation of the neutron capture product Cs-134g is particularly complicated, because the production of Cs-133 (stable cumulative fission product from mass chain 133) has to be taken into account The neutron capture cross section for Cs-133 for thermal neutrons is well known, but the energy spectrum of the neutrons in a reactor includes higher energies according to the degree of moderation. Therefore the cross section was fitted from a gamma scan of spent fuel rods in a hot cell. The method of the calculation of the nuclide activities and the interpretation of the gamma measurements of the spent fuel pool samples from Fukushima Daiichi 1-4 are described in detail. It could be shown that at most only very minor mechanical damage of some spent fuel elements occurred during the accident and the later phase of the clearing work. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Melting temperature of MOX fuel for FBR applications: TRANSURANUS modelling and experimental findings	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							MIXED-OXIDE FUELS; UO2-PUO2 SYSTEM; PHASE-DIAGRAM; FAST-REACTORS; PLUTONIUM; BEHAVIOR; PU; REDISTRIBUTION; EXTENSION; LIQUIDUS	The paper is focused on the modelling of the melting temperature of mixed oxide (MOX) fuel for fast breeder reactors (FBRs). After a review of the models available in the TRANSURANUS (TU) code and in the open literature, their predictions were compared to an experimental dataset compiled from published measurements. The recommended model of TRANSURANUS was confirmed to be in good agreement with experimental data. A critical discussion of the comparison provided additional useful indications for the future development of the code and for the recommendations to the users involved in the analysis of the performance of fast reactor fuel. A special attention was given to the presence of minor actinides (MA), a topic of great importance for closure of the nuclear fuel cycle. In this frame, the code could be extended with the model of Konno in order to account for the presence of minor actinides. Finally, the review of the experimental data indicated the need for a reassessment of the effect of the oxygen-to-metal (O/M) ratio on the melting temperature in the low plutonium content domain of relevance to FBR fuel.

A RIA is a scenario challenging the fuel integrity and consequently, devoted experimental campaigns and related code simulations have been extensively performed. In all experiments in which irradiated fuel is tested, the experiment is preceded by in reactor period, i.e. the base irradiation. In the present paper the considered RIA experiment is CIP3-1 performed in CABRI reactor (part of the OECD/NEA WGFS benchmark); a discussion about the relevance of the base irradiation simulation is presented. Such a work is conducted by sensitivities calculation in which a single parameter, among a preselected set, is changed. The range of variation of such parameters is either supplied within the selected RIA test specification or is taken from typical values available in the open literature. All mentioned calculations have been performed developing a specific model in TRANSURANUS code. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lee, HC; Lim, HS; Han, TY; Cerba, S				Lee, Hyun Chul; Lim, Hong Sik; Han, Tae Young; Cerba, Stefan			A neutronic feasibility study on a small LEU fueled reactor for space applications	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Space reactor; Low enriched uranium fuel; Minimum critical mass; Launch accident safety		In this paper, a neutronic feasibility study on a small space reactor with LEU fuel is presented. The minimum critical reactor mass of a simple homogeneous core model was investigated for the variety of fuel types, moderator materials, and reflector materials. Lithium hydride (LiH) with 99.99% enriched Li-7 showed a very good performance in terms of reactor mass. However, further study should be conducted to resolve the problems that could rise from the poor thermal properties of LiH such as a low melting point, low thermal conductivity, and high thermal expansion coefficient. The combination of uranium metal fuel and zirconium hydride (ZrH1.5) moderator with a Be reflector showed a good performance as well. Uranium hydride (UH3) is a very attractive fuel from a neutronic point of view. However, it requires hydrogen pressurization for high temperature operation due to its low hydrogen decomposition temperature. It was also shown that the core reactivity can be maximized or the critical reactor mass can be further reduced by adopting a heterogeneous core configuration through stacking fuel and moderator plates. Three small space reactors with a control rod system and NaK coolant pipes have been designed and the neutronic performance of these reactors during their life time as well as their safety behavior during various accident scenarios have also been investigated. All the three reactors showed similar neutronic performance during their life time, nevertheless, the smallest reactor mass was achieved in case of a reactor with heterogeneous core configuration. It was also found that a thick reflector is required to keep the reactor subcritical during launch accident scenarios involving a loss of the reflector and the control rods. In "the worst-case accident scenarios" in which the control rods are missing without any damage in the reflector, the reactors became supercritical even in cases when thick reflectors are used. Such situation is inevitable for any space reactor as long as a conventional control rod system or control drum system is adopted as the reactivity control system of the reactor. Efforts should be made to overcome this drawback of the conventional reactivity control systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The safety of SFP under this circumstance is very important. Large amounts of radioactive materials would be easily released into the environment if a severe accident happened in the SFP, because the spent fuel pool (SFP) in a PWR nuclear power station (NPS) is often located in the fuel handing building outside the reactor containment. To gain insight into the loss of pool coolant accident progression for a pressurized water reactor (PWR) SFP, a computational model was established by using the Modular Accident Analysis Program (MAAP5). Important factors such as Zr oxidation by air, air natural circulation and thermal radiation were considered for partial and complete drainage accidents without mitigation measures. The calculation indicated that even if the residual water level was in the active fuel region, there was a chance to effectively remove the decay heat through axial heat conduction (if the pool cooling system failed) or steam cooling (if the pool cooling system was working). For sensitivity study, the effects of emergency ventilation and water injection on the accident progression were analyzed. The analysis showed that for the current configuration of high-density storage racks, it was difficult to cool the spent fuels by air natural circulation. Enlarging the space between the adjacent assemblies was a way of increasing air natural circulation flow rate and maintaining the coolability of SFP. Water injection to the bottom of the SFP helped to recover water inventory, quenching the high temperature assemblies to prevent melting, and even the molten corium pool to avoid molten-corium-concrete-interaction (MCCI).

The majority of commercial reactors in operation in the world are PWRs, so to study the minor actinide transmutation characteristics in the PWRs and ultimately realize the successful minor actinide transmutation in PWRs are crucial problem in the area of the nuclear waste disposal. The key issues associated with the minor actinide transmutation are the appropriate loading patterns when introducing minor actinides to the PWR core. We study two different minor actinide transmutation materials loading patterns on the PWR burnable poison rods, one is to coat a thin layer of minor actinide in the water gap between the zircaloy cladding and the stainless steel which is filled with water, another one is that minor actinides substitute for burnable poison directly within burnable poison rods. Simulation calculation indicates that the two loading patterns can load approximately equivalent to 5-6 PWR annual minor actinide yields without disturbing the PWR k(eff) markedly. The PWR k(eff) can return criticality again by slightly reducing the boric acid concentration in the coolant of PWR or removing some burnable poison rods without coating the minor actinide transmutation materials from PWR core. In other words, loading minor actinide transmutation material to PWR does not consume extra neutron, minor actinide just consumes the neutrons which absorbed by the removed control poisons. Both minor actinide loading patterns are technically feasible; most importantly do not need to modify the configuration of the PWR core and composition of nuclear fuel. Furthermore, the two minor actinide loading patterns completely isolate minor actinide transmutation materials from nuclear fuel, so it also facilitates fuel reprocessing after discharged from PWR core. We believe that loading minor actinide to PWR burnable poison rods for transmutation is an optimal minor actinide loading pattern. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

As a result of the periodic safety review on Wolsong Unit 3 & 4 in 2011, the regulator recommended that an assessment on the long-term accumulation trend of environmental radioactivity around Wolsong Unit 3 & 4 should be performed. In response to this, the assessment was performed based on environmental monitoring data and non-parametric statistical tool (i.e., Mann-Kendall Test). The environmental monitoring data included indicator organisms, soil and marine deposit which were usually monitored for verification of the typical radioactivity level. Most results of the assessment showed no trend and only a few results showed a slight increase. It was concluded that the radioactivity accumulation due to the operation of the plant was insignificant and thus no concern has been raised regarding any effect on the safety and health of the residents around Wolsong NPP site. It is expected that the result of this study could be utilized to establish the plan and policy for environmental monitoring at other NPP sites. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

NDT methods and sipping test are practical techniques which are used for this purpose. Assessing the fuel integrity by NDT is a troublesome process which could incur personal overdose due to high radiation, requiring large space, and heavy equipment. Therefore to overcome problems associated with the NDT process, sipping test is widely used. The main purpose of this article is introducing sipping test simulator (STS) which is so important for training. Also, this article describes the procedure and methodology used to perform sipping test on the fuel assemblies either in reactor pool or spent fuel storage pool. A unique ability of this simulator is analyzing direct spectroscopy files from experimental data of a real operating reactor. The sipping test simulator is a full-feature training curriculum in spent nuclear fuels storage technology with a PC-based simulator. This simulator is written in C# programming language for a Windows based computer. The simulator will teach everything needed to know for identifying the fuel defects using sipping test process. As learning the basics of sipping test step wise, a freshman operator will soon be able to accomplish all steps in practice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

From a proliferation perspective, an advantage of pyroprocessing is its inability to isolate pure plutonium. However, because plutonium is present in the process, it needs to be effectively safeguarded to protect against diversion of plutonium-containing materials that could be post-processed elsewhere. The most complicated unit to safeguard in the process is the electro-refiner where UNF is chemically separated into several material entities. Molten LiCl-KCl serves as the electrolyte into which actinides (including uranium and plutonium), rare earths, and other active metals from the fuel are partitioned after being oxidized to chloride salts. Various voltammetric methods are being developed to measure the concentration of actinides in the molten salt in near-real-time. However, these methods have mostly been applied to molten salt mixtures containing a single actinide. Unfortunately, the presence of multiple actinides will create interferences in the electrochemical responses which could make traditional analysis of voltammetric data inaccurate for determining individual species concentrations. It is proposed to use multivariate techniques to more accurately predict concentrations of multiple actinides from voltammetric data. Two techniques, principal component analysis and partial least squares, are demonstrated on experimental and simulated data for molten salt mixtures containing uranium and plutonium. These techniques consistently yielded more accurate predictions of uranium and plutonium concentrations than simply using peak height. Possible methods of employing multivariate techniques in safeguarding an electrorefiner are also demonstrated. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

MCNPX (Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtend) computer code based on Mont Carlo method, is used to design two models for a BWR fuel bundle in a typical operating temperature and pressure conditions, the first is the oxide fuel bundle model and the second is the blanket-seed (BS) bundle model. A test case was compared with a previously published data calculated by HELIOS code and good agreement was found. The two models are used to determine the multiplication factor, pin-by-pin power distribution and thermal neutron flux distribution for both UO2 and (LIZr/ThO2) fuels. BS bundle model improves the performance of BWR in different ways: (a) by increasing the energy extracted per fuel assembly, (b) by reducing the uranium ore, (c) reducing the plutonium accumulated in BWR through burn-up and continues to grow throughout the world, and (d) by increasing fuel burn-up and reactor lifetime.

J	Hidayatullah, R; Hartanto, D; Kim, Y				Hidayatullah, Rully; Hartanto, Donny; Kim, Yonghee			A novel research reactor concept based on coated particle fuel	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Research reactor; Coated particle fuel (CPF); Plate fuel; Multi-batch fuel management; Equilibrium cycle; Doppler effect		This work presents a preliminary study of a novel plate-type fuel concept for a high-performance and ultra-safe research reactor. This new fuel type consists of coated particle fuel (CPF) randomly dispersed in an aluminum matrix with a certain packing fraction that can be adjusted depending on the reactor design requirements. The CPF can also be varied in the fuel kernel material between UC and UO2. For the purpose of this study, UO2 was used as the reference fuel type. Using this novel fuel type, a 20 MWth pool-type research reactor was investigated to determine the preliminary performance and safety characteristics of the new fuel. The core thermal analysis was done using the MATRA-P code. The neutronics analysis was done using the Monte Carlo Serpent code for an equilibrium cycle resulting from a multi-batch fuel management. In this analysis, it was found that the Doppler effect is significantly enhanced through the implementation of CPF, in turn improving the inherent safety of the reactor. In addition to the notable improvement in safety, the new fuel type also promises to be able to achieve a high thermal neutron flux, improving the performance and utility of the reactor. It is concluded that the CPF-based fuel concept presented in this paper can enable new high-flux reactor designs using simple plate-type fuels with improved safety. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

For each case, increased interlobar bridging was observed in nuclei of the myeloid cells, many of which were bilobed and morphologically similar to Pelger Huet (PH) cells. The high-dose group (n = 5, 2.98-4.61 Gy-Eq) exhibited 13.0 +/- 0.85% PH cells (mean +/- SEM) in the neutrophil population compared to 6.8 +/- 1.6% in the low-dose group (n = 3, 0.29-0.86 Gy-Eq; p = 0.008). An age-and gender-matched control group (n = 8) exhibited 3.6 +/- 0.9% PH cells. Results of a one-way ANOVA show that the high-dose group is statistically different from both the low-dose group and the control group (p = 0.002). However, the low-dose group is not statistically different from the control group (p = 0.122). The mean number of nuclear lobes in blood neutrophils was also enumerated as a function of time after exposure and was found to be diminished, consistent with incomplete nuclear segmentation that is characteristic of the Pelger Huet anomaly (PHA). In contrast to these changes in myeloid cells, the morphology of erythrocytes and platelets appeared to be normal. The authors conclude that ionizing radiation induces abnormal morphology of circulating neutrophils, which is similar to the pseudo-PHA that is acquired in disorders such as myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, and leukemoid reactions. Potential molecular mechanisms by which radiation induces this morphological change are discussed. From this cohort, the biomarker appears to be present early post-accident (<9 h) and stable at least up to 16 y post-accident. Assessment of circulating pseudo-Pelger Huet cells is being investigated as a potential biodosimetric tool.

DECORPORATION OF SYSTEMICALLY DISTRIBUTED AMERICIUM BY A NOVEL ORALLY ADMINISTERED DIETHYLENETRIAMINEPENTAACETIC ACID (DTPA) FORMULATION IN BEAGLE DOGS	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						Am-241; dogs; DTPA; health effects	LIPOPHILIC POLYAMINOCARBOXYLIC ACID; ZN-DTPA; SEQUESTERING AGENTS; ACTINIDE CHELATORS; INITIAL EVALUATION; INHALED PLUTONIUM; DRINKING-WATER; RAT; EFFICACY; CONTAMINATION	Novel decorporation agents are being developed to protect against radiological accidents and terrorists attacks. Radioactive americium is a significant component of nuclear fallout. Removal of large radioactive materials, such as Am-241, from exposed persons is a subject of significant interest due to the hazards they pose. The objective of this study was to evaluate the dose-related efficacy of daily doses of NanoDTPA (TM) Capsules for decorporating Am-241 administered intravenously as a soluble citrate complex to male and female beagle dogs. In addition, the efficacy of the NanoDTPA (TM) Capsules for decorporating Am-241 was directly compared to intravenously administered saline and DTPA. Animals received a single IV administration of Am-241(III)-citrate on Day 0. One day after radionuclide administration, one of four different doses of NanoDTPA (TM) Capsules [1, 2, or 6 capsules d(-1) (30 mg, 60 mg, or 180 mg DTPA) or 2 capsules BID], IV Zn-DTPA (5 mg kg(-1) pentetate zinc trisodium) as a positive control, or IV saline as a placebo were administered. NanoDTPA (TM) Capsules, IV Zn-DTPA, or IV saline was administered on study days 1-14. Animals were euthanized on day 21. A full necropsy was conducted, and liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs and trachea, tracheobronchial lymph nodes (TBLN), muscle samples (right and left quadriceps), gastrointestinal (GI) tract (stomach plus esophagus, upper and lower intestine), gonads, two femurs, lumbar vertebrae (L1-L4), and all other soft tissue remains were collected. Urinary and fecal excretion profiles were increased approximately 10-fold compared to those for untreated animals. Tissue contents were decreased compared to untreated controls. In particular, liver content was decreased by approximately eightfold compared to untreated animals. The results from this study further demonstrate that oral NanoDTPA (TM) Capsules are equally efficient compared to IV Zn-DTPA in decorporation of actinides.

Exposure rate measurements were performed at 1 m and 5 cm from the surface of each treated patient until patient release. Dose estimates based on measured exposure rates were compared with those based on analytic point-source (PSM) and line-source (LSM) models. Effective doses D(infinity) to travelers, co-workers and sleeping partners were estimated by using the standard gamma factor (Gamma) and the physical half-life or the values derived from measured data. Seven hundred ten patients were studied until the exposure at 1 m was below the constraints of 0.010 mSv. The I-131 activities administered ranged from 1.85 to 11.0 GBq (median: 3.7 GBq), according to the therapeutic requirements. Based on the PSM and an experimental G, the mean/maximum estimated D(8) to sleeping partners, partners, travelers, and co-workers were 2.60/20.65, 0.32/2.53, 0.96/7.59, and 0.57/4.50 mSv, respectively. Using the LSM and an experimental G, the D(infinity) values were 2.41/19.15, 0.32/2.50, 0.83/6.62, and 0.57/4.42 mSv, respectively, while they were almost double using the theoretical G. The results presented, based on measured data in a large cohort of I-131-treated thyroid cancer patients, will allow more accurate estimation of potential third-party D(infinity) following patient release and thus may be used to better informphysicians and hospital staff on recommendations for patient release and post-release precautions following radioiodine therapies.

Now, many of these sites are being remediated to remove legacy materials including chemical and radioactive wastes. Along with remediation comes the responsibility to adequately assess risk to cleanup workers who could be exposed to any hazardous materials, including resuspended uranium dust, encountered during environmental restoration. Inhalation of resuspended uranium represents one of the exposure hazards at an abandoned former metal rolling mill where approximately 11 thousand tons of uranium metal was rolled between 1947 and 1958. Residual uranium contamination in the dirt floor of this abandoned site has been exposed to rain, ice, snow, and other environmental factors for more than 50 y. This report describes the solubility of the uranium contamination in this dirt measured in vitro using a modified recipe for simulated lung fluid that contains a pulmonary surfactant. Small (0.1 g) aliquots of dirt collected at this site were sequentially dissolved in simulated lung fluid for increasing periods of time up to 30 d. Solubility was classified according to the ICRP categories as fast, medium, and slow. Results demonstrate that the solubility designation for the uranium contamination in the dirt is approximately 50% fast, 15% medium, and 35-40% slow. There was no observed difference in solubility when a pulmonary surfactant was added to the simulated lung fluid.

Lynn			A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE ON THE US RESPONSE TO THE FUKUSHIMA RADIOLOGICAL EMERGENCY	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						dose assessment; emergency planning; public information; radiation	NUCLEAR-POWER-PLANT; ACCIDENT	On 11 March 2011, northern Japan was struck by first a magnitude 9.0 earthquake off the eastern coast and then by an ensuing tsunami. At the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), these twin disasters initiated a cascade of events that led to radionuclide releases. Radioactive material from Japan was subsequently transported to locations around the globe, including the U.S. The levels of radioactive material that arrived in the U.S. were never large enough to cause health effects, but the presence of this material in the environment was enough to require a response from the public health community. Events during the response illustrated some U.S. preparedness challenges that previously had been anticipated and others that were newly identified. Some of these challenges include the following: (1) Capacity, including radiation health experts, for monitoring potentially exposed people for radioactive contamination are limited and may not be adequate at the time of a large-scale radiological incident; (2) there is no public health authority to detain people contaminated with radioactive materials; (3) public health and medical capacities for response to radiation emergencies are limited; (4) public health communications regarding radiation emergencies can be improved to enhance public health response; (5) national and international exposure standards for radiation measurements (and units) and protective action guides lack uniformity; (6) access to radiation emergency monitoring data can be limited; and (7) the Strategic National Stockpile may not be currently prepared to meet the public health need for KI in the case of a surge in demand from a large-scale radiation emergency. Members of the public health community can draw on this experience to improve public health preparedness.	[Whitcomb, Robert C., Jr.; Ansari, Armin J.; Buzzell, Jennifer J.; McCurley, M.

The system analyzes time-interval data (e.g., time between counts), as this was shown to be a more sensitive technique for detecting low count rate sources compared to analyzing counts per unit interval (Luo et al. 2013). Two distinct versions of the detection system are developed. The first is intended for situations in which the sample is fixed and can be measured for an unlimited amount of time. The second version is intended to detect sources that are physically moving relative to the detector, such as a truck moving past a fixed roadside detector or a waste storage facility under an airplane. In both cases, the detection system is expected to be active indefinitely; i.e., it is an online detection system. Both versions of the multi-energy detection systems are compared to their respective gross count rate detection systems in terms of Type I and Type II error rates and sensitivity.

Furthermore, this increase occurs without a threshold. However, these conclusions are at variance with the results reported by other investigators. A possible cause of these inconsistencies could be the lack of application of microdosimetric considerations when discussing "dose" to the lung.

Records involving nonhuman primate experiments performed from 1973 to 1987 were collected and compiled by researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. These records included early blood samples that were taken after soluble plutonium was administered via intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intravenous injection. Samples were collected as early as 5 min post injection with several samples collected during the first few weeks. The NCRP 156 biokinetic model was developed primarily from animal experiments due to insufficient human data not influenced by chelation therapy. This work compared the NCRP 156 biokinetic model default transfer rate constants to the early blood excretion data from nonhuman primate experiments for Pu-238. These results indicated that the blood content of nonhuman primates exhibited "moderate" retention properties for simulated wound conditions. Additionally, there was no evidence of long-term retention of plutonium in the whole blood samples, confirming that plutonium was not incorporated within blood cells. Particle solubility characteristics should be considered for wounds when using the NCRP 156 wound biokinetic model.

J	Kobayashi, M; Oya, Y; Munakata, K; Okuno, K				Kobayashi, Makoto; Oya, Yasuhisa; Munakata, Kenzo; Okuno, Kenji			Developing a tritium release model for Li2TiO3 with irradiation-induced defects	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							LITHIUM METATITANATE; BREEDER MATERIALS; BEHAVIOR; HYDROGEN; PELLETS; GRAIN	The annihilation kinetics of irradiation-induced defects in Li2TiO3 was evaluated by electron spin resonance. The radiation defects were stabilized with increasing defect density by interaction with neighboring defects. Subsequently, the tritium migration model in Li2TiO3 was established by integrating the kinetics of tritium diffusivity in Li2TiO3 crystalline grains, tritium trapping/detrapping at oxygen vacancies and hydroxyl groups, and annihilation of irradiation-induced defects. The contribution of hydrogen isotopes contained in tritium recovery gas was also considered in this model. The model can demonstrate an overall profile of out-of-pile tritium release for Li2TiO3 with various neutron fluences. Tritium release behavior under neutron irradiation was also estimated by the present established model. The tritium inventory increased under high neutron flux because of the continuous generation of tritium trapping sites, and the addition of hydrogen isotopes to the purge gas could reduce the tritium inventory for Li2TiO3.

Atomistic investigation of the structure and transport properties of tilt grain boundaries of UO2	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATION; FISSION-GAS RELEASE; STABILIZED CUBIC-ZIRCONIA; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; OXYGEN DIFFUSION; SELF-DIFFUSION; INTERATOMIC POTENTIALS; NANOCRYSTALLINE UO2; POLYCRYSTALLINE UO2; NUCLEAR-FUELS	We apply atomistic simulation techniques to address whether oxygen shows higher diffusivity at the grain boundary region compared to that in bulk UO2, and whether the relative diffusivity is affected by the choice of the grain boundary. We consider coincident site lattice grain boundaries, Sigma 3, Sigma 5, Sigma 9, Sigma 11 and Sigma 19, expressing the {n n 1}, {n 1 1}, and {n 1 0} surfaces, and evaluate the extent that the grain boundary structures affect the diffusion of oxygen. We found that oxygen diffusion is enhanced at all boundaries and in the adjacent regions, with strong dependence on the temperature and local structure.

Straight-chain halocarbon forming fluids for TRISO fuel kernel production - Tests with yttria-stabilized zirconia microspheres	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							INTERNAL GELATION; CERIA	Current methods of TRISO fuel kernel production in the United States use a sol-gel process with trichloroethylene (TCE) as the forming fluid. After contact with radioactive materials, the spent TCE becomes a mixed hazardous waste, and high costs are associated with its recycling or disposal. Reducing or eliminating this mixed waste stream would not only benefit the environment, but would also enhance the economics of kernel production. Previous research yielded three candidates for testing as alternatives to TCE: 1-bromotetradecane, 1-chlorooctadecane, and 1-iodododecane. This study considers the production of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) kernels in silicone oil and the three chosen alternative formation fluids, with subsequent characterization of the produced kernels and used forming fluid. Kernels formed in silicone oil and bromotetradecane were comparable to those produced by previous kernel production efforts, while those produced in chlorooctadecane and iodododecane experienced gelation issues leading to poor kernel formation and geometry.

Transmission electron microscopy characterization of the fission gas bubble superlattice in irradiated U-7 wt%Mo dispersion fuels	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							NONDESTRUCTIVE ANALYSES; LATTICE FORMATION; 7.9-PERCENT FIMA; RIM STRUCTURE; KRYPTON IONS; HIGH BURNUP; UO2 FUEL; MOLYBDENUM; TEMPERATURE; METALS	Transmission electron microscopy characterization of irradiated U-7 wt%Mo dispersion fuel were performed on various U-Mo fuel samples to understand the effect of irradiation parameters (fission density, fission rate, and temperature) on the self-organized fission-gas-bubble superlattice that forms in the irradiated U-Mo fuel. The bubble superlattice was seen to form a face centered cubic structure coherent with the host U-7 wt%Mo body-centered cubic structure. At a fission density between 3.0 and 4.5 x 10(21) fiss/cm(3), the superlattice bubbles appear to have reached a saturation size with additional fission gas associated with increasing burnup predominately accumulating along grain boundaries. At a fission density of similar to 4.5 x 10(21) fiss/cm(3), the U-7 wt%Mo microstructure starts to undergo grain subdivision and can no longer support the ordered bubble superlattice. The sub-divided fuel grains are less than 500 nm in diameter with what appears to be micron-size fission-gas bubbles present on the grain boundaries. Solid fission products typically decorate the inside surface of the micron-sized fission-gas bubbles. Residual superlattice bubbles are seen in areas where fuel grains remain micron sized. Potential mechanisms of the formation and collapse of the bubble superlattice are discussed. Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Miller, B. D.; Gan, J.; Keiser, D. D., Jr.; Robinson, A. B.; Jue, J.

J	Yang, JW; Gao, T; Liu, BQ; Sun, GA; Chen, B				Yang, Jin-Wen; Gao, Tao; Liu, Ben-Qiong; Sun, Guang-Ai; Chen, Bo			Ab initio calculations of the ideal tensile and shear strengths of uranium metal	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							1ST PRINCIPLES CALCULATIONS; TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; WAVE BASIS-SET; ELASTIC PROPERTIES; 1ST-PRINCIPLES; DEFORMATION; CONSTANTS; ALPHA	The mechanical properties under large tensile and shear strains for orthorhombic uranium have been investigated systematically using the ab initio Density Functional Theory (DFT). We calculated the ideal tensile and shear strengths by incrementally deforming the simulation cell using first-principles total energy method. The obtained ideal tensile strengths are 21.3, 14.9, and 12.8 GPa in the [100], [010], and [001] crystalline directions, respectively, and the obtained ideal shear strengths are 14.3, 7.8, and 8.9 GPa in the (100)[011], (010)[101], and (001)[110] slip systems, respectively. In both cases, the present calculated results present typical mechanical anisotropy in different orthorhombic axes and slip systems. In particularly, the calculated electronic density of states (DOS) and the charge density of Cmcm uranium under the loading conditions consistently demonstrate that both tensile and shear deformation processes are intrinsically correlated with the evolution of electronic structure.

Rare earth substituted phosphomolybdates of the formula REE0.9Ca0.1P0.9Mo0.1O4 (REE = Ce, Nd, Sm, Gd) and the wasteform La0.4Nd0.1Y0.1Gd0.1Sm0.1Ce0.1Ca0.1P0.9Mo0.1O4 were synthesized by simple solution route. The prepared compounds were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transformed infrared spectra, thermogravimetric analysis, energy dispersive X-ray analysis and scanning electron microscopic techniques. Chemical durability of the wasteform was studied by dynamic MCC-5 test for a period of one month. Normalized elemental mass loss and leach rate of molybdenum was found to be in the order of 103 g/m(2) and 10(3)-10(1) g/m(2)/d respectively. Polymer-monazite composite wasteform was prepared to control the leaching of molybdenum. The composite approach reduced molybdenum leach rate order from 10(1) to 10 (4) g/m(2)/d.
