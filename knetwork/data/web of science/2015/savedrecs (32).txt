Concentrations of U-238 and Th-232 in samples were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. U-238 and Th-232 in plants were lower than those in relevant soils. A decreasing trend of their activity concentration has been observed in the order vegetable > rice > fruit; and root > leaf > stem. Soil-to-plant TFs for U-238 and Th-232 were also in decreasing order as vegetable > rice > fruit.	[Kritsananuwat, R.; Sahoo, S.

REPRESENTING NUCLEAR CRITICALITY EXCURSION EXPERIMENT DATA BY AN ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						initial spike energy; power; criticality accident	POWER-PLANTS; ACCIDENT; IDENTIFICATION	A feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) is constructed using select nuclear criticality excursion experiment data sets from the French Consequences Radiologiques d'un Accident de Criticite (CRAC) and SILENE reactor campaigns. The ability to represent initial spike characteristics by an ANN provides a new method that is aligned to excursion data more directly and to a wider variable data set than traditional analytic approaches. The ANN is configured, trained, validated, and tested to 85 unique highly enriched uranium (HEU) excursion experiments, considering six input variables and two output variables (specific power and energy). The fidelity of the ANN is enhanced by normalizing the input and output data. The trained ANN is then used to determine output values for 19 select Kinetic Energy Water Boiler experiments and 14 additional CRAC excursions not used in the ANN construction. Furthermore, the same trained ANN is also used for an extensive comparison (80 cases) for a combination of uranium concentrations, concentrations, ramp feed reactivity insertion rates, system volumes, and vertical container sizes. The specific spike energy and power ranges determined are bracketed by published experiment results and are more realistically represented than results derived from well-known analytical methods. The ability to predict initial peak fissions by an ANN does not require determining, a priori, a volume-dependent energy quench parameter ("b") specific to HEU solutions. The results derived from the ANN can aid in designing realistic emergency planning constructs or criticality accident alarm system hardware placements without undue penalty for fission source term uncertainties. Neither excursion characteristics after the initial spike nor explicit time dependencies are modeled by an ANN at this time. The extension of the methods presented is left for further work.			angelopl@y12.doe.gov					ANGELO P.

Investigations were performed to analyze the dispersion of CNTs in a UO2 matrix utilizing homogenization and sonication techniques. Ethanol and ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) were utilized as solvents during the mixing process. Distributions of both multi-walled carbon nanotubes and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) were analyzed. It has been determined that CNTs can be homogeneously distributed into a UO2 matrix using mechanical processes, sonication, and homogenization in the organic solvent ODCB. The powder mixture of UO2 and CNTs was sintered at 1300 degrees C with a hold time of 5 min and 40-MP a pressure in a spark plasma sintering furnace, and the resulting grain size distribution was analyzed. It was observed that where the distribution of CNTs was not well controlled, significant grain growth of UO2 occurred. However, where the CNT distribution is well controlled, the grain growth is limited by the pinning effect of the CNTs along the grain boundaries. The resulting pellet thermal conductivity was improved by 29.7% with the addition of 5 vol % SWNT, relative to pure UO2 values. Raman spectroscopy in conjunction with scanning electron microscopy shows that most CNTs survive both the mixing and sintering processes.

INFLUENCE OF SOLUTION CHEMISTRY ON THE SELECTIVE ADSORPTION OF URANIUM AND THORIUM ONTO ACTIVATED CARBON	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						adsorption; uranium; thorium	AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; COMPETITIVE ADSORPTION; METAL-IONS; REMOVAL; SORPTION; ADSORBENT; SILICA; WASTE; WATER; ACID	Radioactive element separation is of particular interest in nuclear technology. For this purpose, batch experiments were carried out in order to find the best separation conditions of uranium [U(VI)] and thorium [Th(IV)] from aqueous solution using rice straw activated carbon. The influence of pH and contact time on selective adsorption of U(VI) and Th(IV) was investigated. The results indicate that the velocity of these species from liquid phase to the surface of carbon is rapid enough. The reaction rate was fast, requiring only a short contact time of 40 min for U(VI) and 100 min for Th(IV). Sorption reaches maximum at pH 4 for Th(IV) and at pH 5.5 for U(VI). U(VI) and Th(IV) can be separated by the judicious controlling of pH and contact time. They can be separated from each other at pH 4 with different contact time [Th(IV) at lower time and U(VI) at 200 min]. Studies were conducted to examine the change in the adsorption behavior of U(VI) and Th(IV) on adsorbent as a function of employing different complexing agents of mineral and organic acids that are important in industrial and environmental processes, including hydrochloric, nitric, acetic, sulfuric, and phosphoric acids at 0.1M concentration. Acetic acid enhances U(VI) and Th(IV) uptake compared to mineral acids. These procedures may be useful in the separation of U(VI) and Th(IV) from natural or industrial samples containing these elements.	[Yakout, S.

MICROFLUIDIC-BASED SAMPLE CHIPS FOR RADIOACTIVE SOLUTIONS	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						microfluidics; sampling; microcapillary	SEPARATION; EXTRACTION	Historical nuclear fuel cycle process sampling techniques required sample volumes ranging in the tens of milliliters. The radiation levels experienced by analytical personnel and equipment, in addition to the waste volumes generated from analysis of these samples, have been significant. These sample volumes also impacted accountability inventories of required analytes during process operations. To mitigate radiation dose and other issues associated with the historically larger sample volumes, a microcapillary sample chip was chosen for further investigation. The ability to obtain microliter sample volumes coupled with a remote automated means of sample loading, tracking, and transporting to the analytical instrument would greatly improve analytical efficiency while reducing both personnel exposure and radioactive waste volumes. Sample chip testing was completed to determine the accuracy, repeatability, and issues associated with the use of microfluidic sample chips used to supply microliter sample volumes of lanthanide analytes dissolved in nitric acid for introduction to an analytical instrument for elemental analysis.

The range of the specific activities of natural radionuclides was first evaluated by analyzing Ac-228 and Bi-214, which are Th-232 and Ra-226 indicators, respectively, in about 100 samples of raw materials and by-products through a gamma-ray spectrometer. From further experiments using several samples selected based on the results of the distribution of natural radionuclides, the validation of their analytical evaluations for the indirect measurements using a gamma-ray spectrometer and direct measurements using ICP-MS was assured by comparing their results. Chemically processed products from the raw materials, such as Zr sand and ceramic balls, were generally shown for the type of bead and particularly analyzed showing a definite disequilibrium with above a 50% difference between U-238 and Ra-226 in the uranium series and Th-232 and Ra-228 in the thorium series.

Gamma-ray spectroscopy in the decay of Se-83 to levels of Br-83	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Se-83, Br-83; Se-81g,Se-m gamma ray spectroscopy; Br-83, Kr-83; Br-81 energy levels	ENERGY CALIBRATION; KR-83	High-resolution gamma ray spectroscopy experiments have been done to study the emissions from the radioactive decay of 22-min Se-83g produced from neutron capture using samples of enriched Se-82. Energy and intensity values have been obtained to roughly an order of magnitude greater precision than in previous studies. Based on energy sums, 2 new levels are proposed in the daughter Br-83 and one previously proposed level is shown to be doubtful. Some 25 new transitions appear to decay with the Se-83 halflife, about half of which can be accommodated among the previous or newly proposed levels. Several previous gamma ray placements are shown to be inconsistent with the new determinations of the Br-83 energy levels, but cannot be accommodated anywhere else among the known levels. As a result of the missing gamma ray placements, some of the beta branchings in the decay to levels of Br-83 appear to be negative. Gamma rays from the 2.4-h decay of the daughter Br-83 to levels of Kr-83 have also been observed, along with decays of Se-81g,Se-m present as a small impurity in the enriched samples and also as a strong component in irradiated samples of natural Se.

Self-attenuation as a function of gamma ray energy in naturally occurring radioactive material in the oil and gas industry	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM); Oil and gas industry; Self-attenuation correction factor; Gamma ray absorption	SAMPLES; DETECTOR	Self-attenuation correction factors were experimentally determined using radioactive point sources in combination with a subject material of naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) obtained from oil exploration waste products. The self-attenuation correction factors were taken across a range of gamma ray energies from 41.73 to 1408.0 keV. It is noted that the greatest amount of self-attenuation occurs in the energy regime below 200 keV and rises to near zero attenuation at higher energies for these types of samples. For the 46.5 keV gamma ray of Pb-210 there can be an underestimation of 62%. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[Millsap, D.

J	da Silva, ML; Bonotto, DM				da Silva, Marcio Luiz; Bonotto, Daniel Marcos			Uranium isotopes in groundwater occurring at Amazonas State, Brazil	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Groundwater; Tube wells; Dissolved uranium; U-234/U-238 activity ratio; Amazon area	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; WATER; ENHANCEMENT; TRANSPORT; BEHAVIOR; COLLOIDS; THORIUM; U-234	This paper reports the behavior of the dissolved U-isotopes U-238 and U-234 in groundwater providing from 15 cities in Amazonas State, Brazil. The isotope dilution technique accompanied by alpha spectrometry were utilized for acquiring the U content and U-234/U-238 activity ratio (AR) data, 0.01-1.4 mu g L-1 and 1.0-3.5, respectively. These results suggest that the water is circulating in a reducing environment and leaching strata containing minerals with low uranium concentration. A tendency to increasing ARs values following the groundwater flow direction is identified in Manaus city. The AR also increases according to the SW-NE directions: Uarini -> Tefe; Manacapuru -> Manaus; Presidente Figueiredo -> Sao Sebastiao do Uatuma; and Boa Vista do Ramos -> Parintins. Such trends are possibly related to several factors, among them the increasing acid character of the waters. The waters analyzed are used for human consumption and the highest dissolved U content is much lower than the maximum established by the World Health Organization. Therefore, in view of this radiological parameter they can be used for drinking purposes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Measurements of liquid phase residence time distributions in a pilot-scale continuous leaching reactor using radiotracer technique	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Uranium; Continuous leaching reactor; Residence time distribution; Mean residence time; Radiotracer; Dead volume; Tanks-in-series model		An alkaline based continuous leaching process is commonly used for extraction of uranium from uranium ore. The reactor in which the leaching process is carried out is called a continuous leaching reactor (CLR) and is expected to behave as a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) for the liquid phase. A pilot-scale CLR used in a Technology Demonstration Pilot Plant (TDPP) was designed, installed and operated; and thus needed to be tested for its hydrodynamic behavior. A radiotracer investigation was carried out in the CLR for measurement of residence time distribution (RTD) of liquid phase with specific objectives to characterize the flow behavior of the reactor and validate its design. Bromine-82 as ammonium bromide was used as a radiotracer and about 40-60 MBq activity was used in each run. The measured RTD curves were treated and mean residence times were determined and simulated using a tanks-in-series model. The result of simulation indicated no flow abnormality and the reactor behaved as an ideal CSTR for the range of the operating conditions used in the investigation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Confirmation of 20% error in the Po-209 half-life	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Half-life; Tracer; Po-209; Po-210; Error; Uncertainty; Radioactivity; Environment		First results of a half-life measurement of Po-209 show 20% discrepancy with the formerly recommended value of 102 (5) years, which was based on a single experiment performed in 1956. After one year of measurement, a statistical uncertainty on T-1/2 of 3.5% has been reached and effects of long-term instability are assumed to be less than 5%. The preliminary half-life value obtained in this work, 120 (6) years, supports the newly determined value of 125.2 (33) years by Colle et al. (2014). The 20% error in the half-life has an impact on numerous measurements in which aged Po-209 solutions were used as a tracer. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Accounting for the roundedness of the crystal's front edges and an inhomogeneous description of the detector's dead layers were shown to achieve better agreement between measurements and simulation efficiency determination. The calculations were experimentally verified using point sources in the energy range from 50 key to 1400 key, and an overall uncertainty less than 2% was achieved. In order to use the detector for different matrices and geometries in radioactivity, the suggested model was validated by changing the counting geometry and by using multi-gamma disc sources. The introduced simulation approach permitted the revaluation of the performance of an HPGe detector in comparison of its initial condition, which is a useful tool for precise determination of the thickness of the inhomogeneous dead layer.

Secondary ion mass spectrometry signatures for verifying declarations of fissile-material production	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Secondary ion mass spectrometry; Signatures; Isotope ratios; Uranium enrichment; Nuclear archeology	URANIUM HEXAFLUORIDE; CAMECA IMS-4F; TOF-SIMS; TREATY; CORROSION; XPS	Direct analysis of uranium enrichment facility components were performed using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). A standard protocol was developed to enable preparation of SIMS samples from a corroded pipe piece without disturbing the corrosion layer. Unique uranium, oxygen and fluorine containing signatures were discovered in the corrosion layer by performing a mass scan of the region of interest from 230 to 280 amu. These signatures identified the source of the corrosion layer as uranium hexafluoride (UF6) or an associated hydrolysis product. Isotopic analysis of the corrosion layer determined enrichment of U-235 to a value of 0.0116 +/- 0.0019 for the U-235/U-238 isotopic ratio as compared to the NIST traceable standard (CRM 112-A) with a natural U-235/U-238 isotopic ratio of 0.007254 +/- 0.000004. SIMS depth analysis revealed that the corrosion layer was isotopically homogenous to a depth of similar to 23.5 mu m. Optical profilometry measurements prior to and following SIMS depth analysis were used to determine a sputter rate of 0.48 nm/s for 18.5 keV O- ion bombardment of the corrosion layer. The data presented is conclusive evidence that SIMS depth analysis can be used to identify novel nuclear archeology signatures from uranium enrichment components and perform meaningful isotopic analysis of these signatures.

The decay properties of both simultaneous produced nuclear isomers Hg-197m and Hg-197 like convenient half life, low energy gamma radiations for imaging, Auger and conversion electrons for therapy are combined with unique chemical and physical properties of mercury and its compounds. Gold as a monoisotopic element has a natural abundance of 100% Au-197 superseding expensive enrichment for the target material. Additionally, the high thermal conductivity of gold enables high beam current irradiations. For separation of target material a liquid-liquid extraction method was applied. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Ca-47 production for Ca-47/Sc-47 generator system using electron linacs	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article							RADIOISOTOPES; THERAPY; SC-47	In this work we have studied the feasibility of photonuclear production of Ca-47 from Ca-48 for Ca-47/Sc-47 generators. Photon flux distribution for electron beams of different energies incident on a tungsten converter was calculated using the MCNPX radiation transport code. The Ca-47 production rate dependence on electron beam energy was found and Ca-47/Sc-47 yields were estimated for a 40 MeV electron beam. It was shown that irradiating enriched targets with a 40 MeV, 1 mA beam will result in tens of MBq g(-1) (few mCi g(-1)) activity of Sc-47. The results of the simulations were benchmarked by irradiating 22.5 g of CaCl2 powder with a 39 MeV electron beam incident on a tungsten converter. Measured Ca-47/Sc-47 activities were found to be in very good agreement with the predictions. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ORGANICALLY BOUND TRITIUM ANALYSIS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLES	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 21-25, 2013	Nice Acropolis, FRANCE					Many methods allow analysing the various forms of tritium in environmental samples; however, there are no published standard methods for measuring organically bound tritium (OBT). Furthermore, there are no certified reference materials of OBT for environmental samples. In environmental samples (plants and animals), the measurement of the various tritium fractions requires extraction of the free water, often through freeze drying processes. Combustion of the dry sample is then carried out to recover organically bound tritium in the combustion water. By measuring these water fractions, the tissue-free water tritium (TFWT) and the OBT concentration can be assessed However, these techniques are tricky and sometimes not available in all monitoring labs. Indeed, most of them measure only the TFWT fraction in food samples, such as wine or milk. Researches to promote the use of validated procedures are on-going in several countries. However, for almost all comparison exercise organisers it is difficult on a yearly basis to provide the samples and to realise the statistical treatment of the results. Therefore, to improve OBT analytical skills, an international task group devoted to the improvement of OBT analytical procedures was created to overcome these limitations. For the first exercise about 20 labs from 8 countries were registered The samples, specially-prepared potatoes, were provided in March 2013 to each participant. Technical information and results from this first exercise are discussed here for all the labs which have realised the five replicates necessary to allow a reliable statistical treatment. From this work an optimised procedure can start to be developed to deal with OBT analysis and will guide subsequent planned OBT trials by the international group.

MULTI-PURPOSE HYDROGEN ISOTOPES SEPARATION PLANT DESIGN	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 21-25, 2013	Nice Acropolis, FRANCE					There is a potential interest at CRL to detritiate moderately tritiated light water and to reclaim tritiated, downgraded heavy water. With only a few limitations, a single CECE process configuration can be designed to remove tritium from heavy water or light water and upgrade heavy water. Such a design would have some restrictions on the nature of the feed-stock and tritium product, but could produce essentially tritium-free light or heavy water that is chemically pure. The extracted tritium is produced as a small quantity of tritiated heavy water. The overall plant capacity is fixed by the total amount of electrolysis and volume of catalyst. In this proposal, with 60 kA of electrolysis a throughput of 15 kg.h(-1) light water for detritiation, about 4 kg.h(-1) of heavy water for detritiation and about 27 kg.h(-1) of 98% heavy water for upgrading can be processed. Such a plant requires about 1,000 L of AECL isotope exchange catalyst. The general design features and details of this multi-purpose CECE process are described in this paper, based on some practical choices of design criteria. In addition, we outline the small differences that must be accommodated and some compromises that must be made to make the plant capable of such flexible operation.	[Boniface, H.

PROPOSAL FOR SECONDARY ENCLOSURE SETUP FOR EXPERIMENTS TO EXPOSE PLASMA FACING MATERIALS TO TRITIATED PLASMA IN VISIONI	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 21-25, 2013	Nice Acropolis, FRANCE					SCK center dot CEN 's VISIONI has the capability to expose candidate plasma facing materials to tritium deuterium plasmas at ITER first wall conditions. To protect operators against exposure to a tritiated atmosphere VISIONI must be placed in a secondary confinement. The current Tritium lab at SCIC center dot CEN has a walk-in process cell which can be used to enclose the plasma chamber and diagnostics of the VISIONI setup, which have a limited tritium inventory. This allows easy accessibility to the setup in a well-ventilated environment. Routine operations should be conducted from outside the process cell and maintenance operations can be conducted from within the process cell with proper protections. The tritium storage and supply can be enclosed in a glove box with a dedicated air detritiation system which is activated during an experiment or in case of an incident. The detritiation system will oxidize tritium and capture it on molecular sieves. By using this confinement approach it is possible to expose materials to a tritiated plasma while maintaining good accessibility of the VISION' setup. This paper describes the proposed confinement system and compares it to the most common approach where the entire system is enclosed into one large glovebox.	[Broeckx, W. E.

The volume of the calorimeters varies between 0.5 and 20.6 liters. About two years ago we have started an extensive work to improve our calorimeters with regard to reliability and precision. We were forced to upgrade 3 of our 4 calorimeters due to the outdated interfaces and software. This work involved creating new Lab View programs driving the devices, re-tuning control loops and replacing obsolete hardware components. In this paper we give a review on the current performance of our calorimeters, comparing it to recently available devices from the market and in the literature.

CLASSIFICATION METHODOLOGY FOR TRITIATED WASTE REQUIRING INTERIM STORAGE	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 21-25, 2013	Nice Acropolis, FRANCE					Fusion machines like the ITER experimental research facility will use tritium as fuel. Therefore, most of the solid radioactive waste will result not only from activation by 14 MeV neutrons, but also from contamination by tritium. As a consequence, optimizing the treatment process for waste containing tritium (tritiated waste) is a major challenge. This paper summarizes the studies conducted in France within the framework of the French national plan for the management of radioactive materials and waste. The paper recommends a reference program for managing this waste based on its sorting, treatment and packaging by the producer. It also recommends setting up a 50-year temporary storage facility to allow for tritium decay and designing future disposal facilities using tritiated radwaste characteristics as input data. This paper first describes this waste program and then details an optimized classification methodology which takes into account tritium decay over a 50-year storage period The paper also describes a specific application for purely tritiated waste and discusses the set-up expected to be implemented for ITER decommissioning waste (current assumption). Comparison between this optimized approach and other viable detritiation techniques will be drawn.

The light water in the fuel bay had built up tritium that had been transferred from the heavy water moderator through normal fuel transfers. A demonstration of the method was done that involved Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling of the swap process and a test program that showed excellent agreement with model prediction for the effective removal of almost all the tritium with a minimal water volume. Building on the successful demonstration, AECL fabricated, installed, commissioned and operated a full-scale system to perform a water swap.

One of them, called ELA (radioactive sodium waste treatment process), is based on the implementation of the sodium-water reaction, in a controlled and progressive way, to remove residual sodium mainly from the sodium purification systems called cold traps. This sodium contains impurities such as sodium hydride, sodium oxide and tritiated sodium hydride. The hydrolysis of these various chemical species leads to the production of a liquid effluent, mainly composed of an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide, and a gaseous effluent, mainly composed of nitrogen (inert gas), hydrogen and steam. The tritium is distributed between these effluents, and, within the gaseous effluent, according to its forms HT and HTO. HTO being 10,000 times more radiotoxic than HT, a precise knowledge of the mechanisms governing the phase distribution of tritium is necessary. Indeed, it will help to design the process needed to optimize the treatment of the off-gas before its release into the environment. This paper presents the first experimental results from a parametric study on the tritium distribution between the various effluents generated during hydrolysis operations. This parametric study has been performed in a laboratory scale hydrolysis process designed at the CEA Cadarache.

If left to accumulate, tritium oxide will become a hazard to the operating staff and public. The primary purpose of a Tritium Removal Facility (TRF) is to reduce tritium concentration in a heavy water moderator. In Korea, operation of a TRF commenced at the Wolsong Nuclear Power Site on July 26th, 2007. Nowadays, KAERI is developing a Very High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor (VHTR). We have developed a tritium behavior analysis code for the VHTR. We also developed analytical methods for the measurement of food stuffs. Korea shared in the construction of the ITER fuel cycle plant with the EU, Japan, and the US, and is responsible for the supply of an SDS (Tritium Storage and Delivery System). We present the recent progress in the development of tritium storage technology, and safety features of the related system. KAERI has been developing tritium technologies related to the Wolsong TRF, HANARO, VHTR, and nuclear fusion fuel systems. We thus present details on the recent development progress of these tritium systems.

Beside new R&D on highly tritiated water, CAPER is presently largely used to support satellite experiments, mainly those dedicated to R&D on advanced analytics. Mutation from R&D to part of the TLK tritium infrastructure necessitated new features to be installed in order to facilitate and optimize tritiated mixtures preparation and sample filling, and to enable satellites experiments to discharge their waste gas to CAPER for clean-up. This paper presents recent CAPER mutations to become a central and key facility at TLK.	[Demange, D.; Fanghaenel, E.; Fischer, S.; Le, T. L.; Priester, F.; Roellig, M.; Schloesser, M.; Simon, K.

MICRO-CHANNEL CATALYTIC REACTOR INTEGRATION IN CAPER AND R&D ON HIGHLY TRITIATED WATER HANDLING AND PROCESSING	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 21-25, 2013	Nice Acropolis, FRANCE				EXPERIENCE; MANAGEMENT; FACILITY; PERMCAT; ITER; TLK	The CAPER facility of the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe has demonstrated the technology for the tokamak exhaust processing. CAPER has been significantly upgraded to pursue R&D towards highly tritiated water (HTW) handling and processing. The preliminary tests using a metal oxide reactor producing HTW afterward detritiated with PERMCAT were successful. In a later stage, a micro-channel catalytic reactor was installed in view of long term R&D program on HTW The integration of this new system in CAPER was carried out along with a careful safety analysis due to high risk associated with such experiments. First experiments using the mu-CCR were performed trouble free, and HTW up to 360 kCi/kg was produced at a rate of 0.5 g/h. Such HTW was collected into a platinized zeolite bed (2 g of HTW for 20 g of Pt-zeolite), and in-situ detritiation was performed via isotopic exchange with deuterium. These first experimental results with tritium confirmed the potential for the capture and exchange method to be used for HTW in ITER.	[Demange, D.; Cristescu, I.; Fanghaenel, E.; Gramlich, N.; Le, T.

Damages of such windows were observed after three months of exposure to highly purified tritium gas in the LOOPINO facility. In this work, the origin of the damages was investigated, identified and eliminated Coating samples manufactured by various physical vapor deposition methods have been tested for durability by exposure to pure tritium gas and subsequent visual inspection. Electron beam deposited coatings showed indications for damage after 17 days of tritium exposure in contrast to samples manufactured by ion assisted deposition or sputtering. An improved coating layout of the sample cell is presented for reliable long-term monitoring of tritium gas using Raman spectroscopy.

MEASUREMENT OF TRITIUM PENETRATION THROUGH CONCRETE MATERIAL COVERED BY VARIOUS PAINTS COATING	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 21-25, 2013	Nice Acropolis, FRANCE				TRITIATED-WATER; HYDROPHOBIC PAINTS	The present study aims at obtaining fundamental data on tritium migration in porous materials, which include soaking effect, interaction between tritium and cement paste coated with paints and transient tritium sorption in porous cement. The amounts of tritium penetrated into or released from cement paste with epoxy and urethane paint coatings were measured. The tritium penetration amounts were increased with the HTO exposure time. Time to achieve a saturated value of tritium sorption was more than 60 days for cement paste coated with epoxy paint and with urethane paint, while that for cement paste without any paint coating took 2 days to achieve it. The effect of tritium permeation reduction by the epoxy paint was higher than that of the urethane. Although their paint coatings were effective for reduction of tritium penetration through the cement paste which was exposed to HTO for a short period, it was found that the amount of tritium trapped in the paints became large for a long period. Tritium penetration rates were estimated by an analysis of one-dimensional diffusion in the axial direction of a thickness of a sample. Obtained data were helpful for evaluation of tritium contamination and decontamination.

Within the location of ESS facility in Lund, Sweden site it is mandatory to demonstrate that the management strategy of the produced tritium ensures the compliance with the country regulation criteria. The aim of this paper is to give an overview of the different aspects of the tritium management in ESS facility. Besides the design parameter study of the helium coolant purification system of the target the consequences of the tritium releasing into the environment were also analyzed. Calculations shown that the annual release of tritium during the normal operations represents a small fraction from the estimated total dose. However, more refined calculations of migration of activated-groundwater should be performed for higher hydraulic conductivities, with the availability of the results on soil examinations. With the assumption of 100% release of tritium to the atmosphere during the occurring of the extreme accidents, it was found as well that the total dose complies with the constraint.

This work/paper proposes a configuration of Tritium Recovery System wherein elemental tritium and water vapors are recovered in a separated, parallel manner. The proposed TRS configuration is a combination of permeators, a platinum microreactor (MR) and a trickle bed reactor (TBR) and consists of two branches: one branch for elemental tritium recovery from tritiated deuterium gas and the second one for tritium recovery from streams containing a significant amount of water vapours but a low amount, below 5%, of tritiated gas. The two branches shall work in a complementary manner in such a way that the bleed stream from the permeators shall be further processed in the MR and TBR in view of achieving the required decontamination level. A preliminary evaluation of the proposed TRS in comparison with state of the art tritium recovery system from tritium processing facilities is also discussed.

Being taken into consideration of multi-structural concrete composed of aggregates, sand, water and cement which contents are CaO, SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, MgO, CaSO4 and so on, tritium path is discussed in terms of the HTO diffusivity and adsorption coeffcient on porous walls. Measures to predict rates of tritium leak from laboratory walls to the environment and residual tritium amounts in concrete are estimated based on previous data. Three cases of accidental or chronic tritium release to laboratory air are discussed using the diffusion-adsorption model.

These models describes overall HTO washout with rain by the first-order kinetic equation, while washout coefficient A depends on the type of rain event and rain intensity and empirical parameters a, b. It was shown recently that variations of published data of washout coefficient are significant Thus A = 10(-4) sec(-1) for the light rain event (similar to 1 mm.hour(-1)) while A = 10(-3) sec(-1) for heavy rain (similar to 25 mm.hour(-1)). Canadian standard recommends washout coefficient of 1.8.10(-4) sec(-1), German standard gives 3.5.10(-5)sec(-1), while published Japan data varies from A = (7.3 +/- 4.1).10(-5) sec(-1) at 2 mm hour(-1) to A = 4.6.10(-4) sec(-1) for the same rain intensity. This means that further investigations of HTO washout process are required. One of the issues is determining the useful relationship between macroscopic parameter of HTO washout A and microscopic HTO exchange rate of HTO molecules in atmosphere and in the raindrop water. Approaches to address this issue have been presented elsewhere. It can be shown that the empirical parameters a, b can be represented through the rain event characteristics using the relationships for molecular impact rate, rain intensity and specific rain water content while washout coefficient can be represented through the exchange rate K, rain intensity, raindrop diameter and terminal raindrop velocity.

FIRST CALIBRATION MEASUREMENTS OF AN FTIR ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY SYSTEM FOR LIQUID HYDROGEN ISOTOPOLOGUES FOR THE ISOTOPE SEPARATION SYSTEM OF FUSION POWER PLANTS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 21-25, 2013	Nice Acropolis, FRANCE				BACKGROUND SUBTRACTION; ITER	Fusion facilities like ITER and DEMO will circulate huge amounts of deuterium and tritium in their fuel cycle with an estimated throughput of kg per hour. One important capability of these fuel cycles is to separate the hydrogen isotopologues. For this purpose the Isotope Separation System (ISS), using cryogenic distillation, as part of the TRitium Enrichment Test Assembly (TRENTA) is under development at Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe. Fourier transform infrared absorption spectroscopy (FTIR) has been selected to prove its capability for inline monitoring of the tritium concentration in the liquid phase at the bottom of the distillation column of the ISS. The actual R&D work is focusing on the calibration of such a system. Two major issues are the identification of appropriate absorption lines and their dependence on the isotopic concentrations and composition. For this purpose the Tritium Absorption IR spectroscopy experiment has been set up as an extension of TRENTA. For calibration a Raman spectroscopy system is used First measurements, with equilibrated mixtures of H-2, D-2 and HD demonstrate that FTIR can be used for quantitative analysis of liquid hydrogen isotopologues and reveal a nonlinear dependence of the integrated absorbance from the D-2 concentration in the 2nd vibrational branch of D-2 FTIR spectra.

The exposure to plasma resulted in a drastic increase in T retention at the surface and/or sub surface. However, the T trapped at the surface/subsurface was easily removed by maintaining the specimens in air at similar to 300 K Formation of radiation-induced defects led to a significant increase in T retention, and T trapped in the defects was not removed at similar to 300 K These observations suggest that displacement damages have the largest effects on T retention at similar to 473 K	[Hatano, Y.; Alimov, V.

THERMAL ENHANCEMENT CARTRIDGE HEATER MODIFIED (TECH MOD) TRITIUM HYDRIDE BED DEVELOPMENT PART I - DESIGN AND FABRICATION	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 21-25, 2013	Nice Acropolis, FRANCE				FISH BED; STORAGE	The Savannah River Site (SRS) tritium facilities have used 1st generation (Gen1) LaNi4.25Al0.75 (LANA(0.75)) metal hydride storage beds for tritium absorption, storage, and desorption. The Gen1 design utilizes hot and cold nitrogen supplies to thermally cycle these beds. Second and 3rd generation (Gen2 and Gen3) storage bed designs include heat conducting foam and divider plates to spatially fix the hydride within the bed. For thermal cycling, the Gen2 and Gen 3 beds utilize internal electric heaters and glovebox atmosphere flow over the bed inside the bed external jacket for cooling. The currently installed Gen1 beds require replacement due to tritium aging effects on the LANA0.7 5 material, and cannot be replaced with Gen2 or Gen3 beds due to different designs of these beds. At the end of service life, Gen1 bed desorption efficiencies are limited by the upper temperature of hot nitrogen supply. To increase end-of-life desorption efficiency, the Gen1 bed design was modified, and a Thermal Enhancement Cartridge Heater Modified (TECH Mod) bed was developed Internal electric cartridge heaters in the new design to improve end-of-life desorption, and also permit in-bed tritium accountability (IBA) calibration measurements to be made without the use of process tritium. Additional enhancements implemented into the TECH Mod design are also discussed	[Klein, J. E.; Estochen, E.

THERMAL ENHANCEMENT CARTRIDGE HEATER MODIFIED TRITIUM HYDRIDE BED DEVELOPMENT PART II - EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION OF KEY CONCEPTUAL DESIGN FEATURES	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 21-25, 2013	Nice Acropolis, FRANCE					The Thermal Enhancement Cartridge Heater Modified (TECH Mod) tritium hydride bed is an interim replacement for the Is' generation (Gen 1) process hydride beds currently in service in the Savannah River Site (SRS) Tritium Facilities. Three new features are implemented in the TECH Mod hydride bed prototype: internal electric cartridge heaters, porous divider plates, and copper foam discs. These modifications will enhance bed performance and reduce costs by improving bed activation and installation processes, in-bed accountability measurements, end-of-life bed removal, and He-3 recovery. A full-scale hydride bed test station was constructed at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) in order to evaluate the performance of the prototype TECH Mod hydride bed. Controlled hydrogen (H-2) absorption/desorption experiments were conducted to validate that the conceptual design changes have no adverse effects on the gas transfer kinetics or H2 storage/release properties compared to those of the Gen I bed. Inert gas expansions before, during, and after H2 flow tests were used to monitor changes in gas transfer rates with repeated hydriding/dehydriding of the hydride material. The gas flow rates significantly decreased after initial hydriding of the material; however, minimal changes were observed after repeated cycling. The data presented herein confirm that the TECH Mod hydride bed would be a suitable replacement for the Gen I bed with the added enhancements expected from the advanced design features.	[Heroux, K.

DETERMINATION OF HYDROGEN DIFFUSION COEFFICIENTS IN F82H BY HYDROGEN DEPTH PROFILING WITH A TRITIUM IMAGING PLATE TECHNIQUE	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	OCT 21-25, 2013	Nice Acropolis, FRANCE				ACTIVATION MARTENSITIC STEELS	Hydrogen diffusion coefficients in a reduced activation ferritic/martensitic steel (F82H) and an oxide dispersion strengthened F82H (ODS-F82H) have been determined from depth profiles of plasma-loaded hydrogen with a tritium imaging plate technique (TIPT) in the temperature range from 298 K to 523 K Data of hydrogen diffusion coefficients, D, in F82H are summarized as D [m(2) s(-1)] =1.1x 10(-7)exp(-16[kJ mol(-1)]/RT). The present data indicate almost no trapping effect on hydrogen diffusion due to an excess entry of energetic hydrogen by the plasma loading, which results in saturation of the trapping sites at the surface and even in the bulk. In the case of ODS-F82H, data of hydrogen diffusion coefficients are summarized as D [m(2) s(-1)] =2.2 x10(-2)exp(-30[kJ mol(-1)/RT) indicating a remarkable trapping effect on hydrogen diffusion caused by tiny oxide particles in the bulk of F82H.

The cooling water will contain tritium with high concentration because tritium can permeate metal walls at high temperature easily. A development of tritium handling technology for confining tritiated water in the fusion facility is an important issue. In addition, it is also important to understand tritium behavior in environment assuming severe accidents. In this study, percolation experiments of tritiated water in soil packed bed were carried out and tritium behavior in soil was discussed. Six soil samples were collected in Hakozaki campus of Kyushu University. These particle densities were same degree as that of general soils and moisture contents were related to BET surface area. For two soil samples used in the percolation experiment of tritiated water, saturated hydraulic conductivity agreed well with the estimating value by Creager. Tritium retention ratio in the soil packed bed was larger than water retention. This is considered to be due to an effect of tritium sorption on the surface of soil particles. The isotope exchange capacity estimated by assuming that H/T ratio of supplied tritiated water and H/T ratio of surface water of soil particle was equal was comparable to that on cement paste and mortar which were obtained by exposure of tritiated water vapor.

Although the tritium release properties of tritium breeders are documented in databases for DEMO blanket design, no in situ examination under fusion neutron (DT neutron) irradiation has been performed In this study, a preliminary examination of the tritium release properties of advanced tritium breeders was performed, and DT neutron irradiation experiments were performed at the fusion neutronics source (FNS) facility in JAEA. Considering the tritium release characteristics, the optimum grain size after sintering is <5 mu m. From the results of the optimization of granulation conditions, prototype Li(2+)xTiO(3+y) pebbles with optimum grain size (<5 mu m) were successfully fabricated The Li(2+)xTiO(3+y) pebbles exhibited good tritium release properties similar to the Li2TiO3 pebbles. In particular, the released amount of HT gas for easier tritium handling was higher than that of HTO water.

A new calorimeter has been developed by Setaram Instrumentation and the CEA Valduc in France. This new calorimeter is designed for drums having a volume bigger than 100L. It guarantees high operator safety by optimizing drum handling and air circulation for cooling, and optimized software for direct measurement of the quantity of nuclear material. The system is designed to provide precise measurements independent of environmental conditions.
