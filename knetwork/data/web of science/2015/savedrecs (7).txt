Characterization of coal and charcoal by alpha-particle and gamma-ray spectrometry	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Topical Meeting on Industrial Radiation and Radioisotope Measurement Applications	JUL 06-11, 2014	Valencia, SPAIN			Coal; Charcoal; Alpha-Particle Spectrometry; Gamma-Ray Spectrometry	FIRED POWER-PLANTS; RADIOACTIVITY; RADIONUCLIDES; SIMULATION; ELEMENTS	Although coal and charcoal have similar physical and chemical characteristics, there are several crystallographic procedures used to distinguish and characterize them. But if the matrix is crushed, there is no standard procedure to distinguish coal from charcoal. In this work, a procedure to characterize coal and charcoal samples based on the radioactive content is proposed. The first assay is by gamma-ray spectrometry, which allows a part of the radioactive content to be determined rapidly and non-destructively. Then, alpha-particle spectrometry is applied to assay the content of those radionuclides which are difficult to determine precisely by gamma-ray spectrometry. This second technique requires prior chemical purification of the carbon sample in order to separate the corresponding radionuclides of interest. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Radon concentration in soil gas and its correlations with pedologies, permeabilities and Ra-226 content in the soil of the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte - RMBH, Brazil	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Topical Meeting on Industrial Radiation and Radioisotope Measurement Applications	JUL 06-11, 2014	Valencia, SPAIN			Radon; Soil; Permeability; Ra-226		The radon concentration in soil gas is directly dependent on the geological characteristics of the area, such as lithology, pedology and on geochemicals, physicals and mineralogicals parameters of the soil. This paper looks for correlations between radon concentrations in soil gas and its soil permeability, U-238, Th-232 and Ra-226 contents in the soil groups classified by pedologies of Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte (RMBH), Minas Gerais, Brazil. The soil gas radon concentrations were determined by using an A/phaGUARD monitor at about 150 measurement points. In soil samples of the same measurement points, the concentrations of Ra-226 were determined by gamma spectrometry (HPGe), and U-233 and Th-232 by ICP-MS. The soil permeabilities were determined by using the RADON-JOK (R) permeameter. The mean concentrations of radon in soil gas ranged from 13.6 +/- 3.0 kBq m(-3) for Litholic Neosols until 60.6 +/- 8.7 kBq m(-3) for Perferric Red Latosols. The mean of Ra-226 activity concentrations presented variation of 12.4 +/- 2.5 Bq kg(-1) for Litholic Neosols until 50.3 +/- 13 Bq kg(-1) for Perferric Red Latosols. Approximately 40% of the soils presented high permeability. The areas of different pedologies were classified by Soil Radon Index (SRI), determined by the soil gas radon concentration and permeability. Approximately 53% of the Perferric Red Latosols measurement site could be classified as "High Risk" (Swedish criteria). The preliminary results may indicate an influence of iron formations present very close to the Perferric Red Latosols in the retention of uranium minerals, and hence an increase in the concentration of radon and radium, whereas the series are in equilibrium in the environment.

Cosmic muon effect in the background of a Si/Si coincidence measurement: Study and application	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Topical Meeting on Industrial Radiation and Radioisotope Measurement Applications	JUL 06-11, 2014	Valencia, SPAIN			CTBTO; PIPSBox; GEANT4; Cosmic muons; Coincidences; Cosmic veto	RADIOACTIVE XENON; GAS	The PIPSBox is a new high resolution electron spectrometer composed of two Si-PIN detectors developed by CEA. It is designed for the measurement of radioxenons by means electron/photon coincidences when coupled to a NaI(TI) or HPGe detector. Alternatively, electron/electron (or Si/Si) coincidences can be studied when focusing on events depositing energy in its two Si-PIN detectors simultaneously. In this paper, such Si/Si coincidence measurements are studied. Especially, it is shown (using Monte-Carlo simulations) that the Si/Si background coincidence spectrum is dominated by secondary cosmic muons. Finally, the cosmic veto efficiency of the gamma(3) spectrometer (a recently developed low-background ground-based photon spectrometer (Cagniant et al., 2015)) was estimated to be 99.0 +/- 0.7% thanks to Si/Si coincidence measurements inside its shielding.

In the present work the sensitivity of the simulations on the hydrogen and boron content in concrete shielding was investigated. MCNP code was used to simulate neutron streaming along the JET Hall personnel entrance labyrinth for deuterium-deuterium and deuterium-tritium plasma sources for different concrete wall compositions. Neutron fluence and ambient dose equivalent along the labyrinth were calculated. Simulation results for the "as built" JET concrete composition were compared against measurements performed using thermoluminescence detectors. This study contributes to the optimization of the radiation shielding of JET and, furthermore, provides information from JET experience that may assist in optimizing and validating the radiation shielding design methodology used in its successor fusion devices ITER and DEMO.

Analysis of radionuclide concentration in air released through the stack of a radiopharmaceutical production facility based on a medical cyclotron	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Topical Meeting on Industrial Radiation and Radioisotope Measurement Applications	JUL 06-11, 2014	Valencia, SPAIN			Medical cyclotron; PET; Radioactive air effluent; Radiopharmaceuticals		Positron emitting radionuclides are increasingly used in medical diagnostics and the number of radiopharmaceutical production facilities have been estimated to be growing worldwide. During the process of production and/or patient administration of radiopharmaceuticals, an amount of these radionuclides might become airborne and escape into the environment. Therefore, the analysis of radionuclide concentration in the air released to the stack is a very important issue to evaluate the dose to the population living around the plant. To this end, sampling and measurement of radionuclide concentration in air released through the stack of a Nuclear Medicine Center (NMC), provided with a cyclotron for radiopharmaceuticals production, must be routinely carried out with an automatic measurement system. In this work is presented the air monitoring system realized at "San Gaetano" NMC at Bagheria (Italy) besides the analysis of the recorded stack relesead air concentration data. Sampling of air was carried out continuously and gamma-ray spectrometric measurement are made on-line and for a short time by using a shielded Marinelli beaker filled with sampled air and a gamma detector. The use of this system allows to have 1440 values of air concentration per day from 2002, year of the start of operation with the cyclotron. Therefore, the concentration values are very many and an analysis software is needed to determine the dose to the population. A comparison with the results of a simulation code based on a Gaussian Plume air dispersion modelling allow us to confirm the no-radiological significance of the stack effluent releases in terms of dose to population and to evaluate possible improvements in the plant devices to reduce the air concentration at stack.

Evaluation of natural radionuclides in Brazilian underground mines	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Topical Meeting on Industrial Radiation and Radioisotope Measurement Applications	JUL 06-11, 2014	Valencia, SPAIN			Natural radioactivity; Detectors; Total effective dose	RADON CONCENTRATION MEASUREMENTS; EXPOSURE; TURKEY	Mineral processing releases long and short half-life radionuclides generating potential exposure to miners. They are internally exposed to radon, thoron and their short-life decay products and, externally, to the gamma emitters scattered in the rock and dust of the mine. Concerning to radiological hazards to workers, this paper focuses on the characterization of the natural radioactivity in the Brazilian underground mines. The radon and its progeny concentrations were measured by using AlphaGUARD and DOSEman detectors, respectively. Radon concentration measurement in groundwater was performed by using RAD7 detector. The U-238 and Th-232 activity concentration in ore and soil samples were determined by ICPMS. Gamma spectrometry was used to determined Ra-226, Ra-228 and K-40 (activity concentrations. The average radon concentration ranged from 113 to 4964 Bq m(-3) and the average Equilibrium Equivalent Concentration varied from 76 to 1174 Bq m(-3). Based on these data, the total annual effective dose for the miners was estimated. The results suggest the need of establishing monitoring and control procedures in some mines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Radiological risk from thoron, a case study: The particularly radon-prone area of Bolsena, and the lesson learned	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Topical Meeting on Industrial Radiation and Radioisotope Measurement Applications	JUL 06-11, 2014	Valencia, SPAIN				NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; DECAY PRODUCTS; INDOOR RADON	The contribution of Rn-220 is usually negligible compared to that of Rn-222: its very short half-life makes escape from its source site within the rock very unlikely and it never has time enough to filtrate through the ground and through cracks in the floors or cellar walls to reach living quarters. This however becomes untrue if walls built with Th-232-rich materials are present: then sizeable amounts of thoron may be detected in the closed areas bounded by those walls. This is the case for many dwellings in central Italy, and the town of Bolsena (northern Latium) is presented as a case study. A typical building of the area, entirely constructed with tuff blocks, is investigated and the annual dose rates calculated for varying distances from the wall. Thoron concentration was found to decrease with a relaxation length of 13 cm. Thoron was found to pose a significant risk. The rate of air exchange was found to produce little effect. Wall plastering acts as a filter: thoron diffuses through it but a HVL of less than 1 cm was found to prevail. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Holecek, J; Otahal, P				Holecek, Josef; Otahal, Petr			Non-destructive decontamination of building materials	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Topical Meeting on Industrial Radiation and Radioisotope Measurement Applications	JUL 06-11, 2014	Valencia, SPAIN			Artificial radionuclides; Decontamination; Strippable coatings; Building materials		For nondestructive radiation decontamination of surfaces it is necessary to use varnishes, such as AR-GONNE, DG1101, DG1108, etc. This text evaluates the use of manufactured strippable coatings for radiation decontamination. To evaluate decontamination capability of such coatings the following varnishes were selected and subsequently used: AZ 1-700 and AXAL 1807S. The varnishes were tested on different building materials surfaces contaminated by short-term radioisotopes of Na-24 or La-140, in water soluble or water insoluble forms. Decontamination quality was assessed by the decontamination efficiency value, defined as the proportion of removed activity to the applied activity. It was found that decontamination efficiency of both used varnishes depends not only on the form of contaminant, but in the case of application of AXAL 1807S varnish it also depends on the method of its application on the contaminated surface. The values of the decontamination efficiency for AZ1-700 varnish range from 46% for decontamination of a soluble form of the radioisotope from concrete surface to 98% for the decontamination of a soluble form of the radioisotope from ceramic tile surface. The decontamination efficiency values determined for AXAL 1807S varnish range from 48% for decontamination of a soluble form of the radioisotope from concrete surface to 96% for decontamination of an insoluble form of the radioisotope from ceramic tile surface. Comparing these values to the values given for the decontaminating varnishes we can conclude that AXAL 1807S varnish is possible to use on all materials, except highly porous materials, such as plasterboard or breeze blocks, or plastic materials. AZ 1-700 varnish can be used for all dry materials except plasterboard. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

High energy muon induced radioactive nuclides in nickel plate and its use for 2-D muon-beam image profile	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						High energy muon; Muon induced radionuclides; Muon-beam image	COSMOGENIC RADIONUCLIDES	Target materials were exposed to a muon beam with an energy of 160 GeV/c at the COMPASS experiment line in CERN-SPS to measure the production cross-sections for muon-incluced radionuclides. A muon imager containing four nickel plates, each measuring 100 mm x 100 mm, exposed to the IP plate successfully detected the muon beam image during an irradiation period of 33 days. The contrasting density rate of the nickel plate was (5.2 +/- 0.7) x 10(-9) PSL/muon per one-day exposure to IP. The image measured 122 mm and 174 mm in horizontal and vertical lengths, respectively, in relation to the surface of the base, indicating that 50 +/- 6% of the muon beam flux is confined to an area of 18% of the whole muon beam. The number of muons estimated from the PSL value in the total beam image area (0.81 +/- 0.1) x 10(13) was comparable to the total muon counts of the ion-chamber at the M2 beam line in the CERN-SPS. The production cross-sections of Cr-51, Mn-54, Co-56, Co-57, and Co-58 in nickel were 0.19 +/- 0.08, 0.34 +/- 0.06, 0.5 +/- 0.05, 3.44 +/- 0.07, 0.4 +/- 0.03 in the unit of mb, respectively, reducing muon associated particles effects.

Meanwhile, simultaneous spectroscopy of alpha particles and gamma-rays has many applications in quantification and distinguishing the alpha-emitting radionuclides which usually occur in the analysis of environmental solid samples. Here, we have developed a system for detection of radioactive actinides (e.g., Am-241) based on the alpha-gamma coincidence technique. The underlying concept, is to assemble two appropriately selected scintillators (i.e., a fast and a slow one) together with a discriminating unit for analysis of their data. Detailed Monte Carlo simulation procedure has been developed using the GEANT4 toolkit to design and find enough knowledge about the response of the system in the studied radiation Field. Various comparisons were made between experimental and simulation data which showed appropriate agreement between them. The calibration was performed and the MDA was estimated as 60 mBq for the phoswich system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Moghadam, S. Rajabi; Feghhi, S. A.

Particle gamma correlations in C-12 measured with the CsI(Tl) based detector array CHIMERA	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Angular distributions; Polarization; Inelastic scattering; Gamma decay; 4 pi detectors	INELASTIC-SCATTERING; NUCLEAR-REACTIONS; 4-PI DETECTOR; SPIN-FLIP; ENERGY; IDENTIFICATION; SCINTILLATORS; BEAMS	The gamma decay of the first excited 4.44 MeV 2 level of C-12, populated by inelastic scattering of proton and O-16 beams at various energies was studied in order to test gamma-ray detection efficiency and the quality of angular distribution information given by the CsI(Tl) detectors of the 4 pi CHIMERA array. The gamma-decay was measured in coincidence with ejectile scattered particles in an approximately 47 geometry allowing to extract the angular distribution in the reference frame of recoiling C-12 target. The typical sin(2) (2 theta) behavior of angular distribution was observed in the case of O-16 beam. Besides that, for the proton beam, in order to explain the observed distribution, the addition of an incoherent flat contribution was required. This latter is the effect of proton spin flip events allowing the population of M= +/- 1 magnetic substates, that is not possible in reactions induced by O-16 beam. A comparison with previously collected data, obtained measuring only in and out of plane proton-gamma-ray coincidences, confirms the good quality of the angular distribution information given by the apparatus. Possible applications with radioactive beams are outlined. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Development of time projection chamber for precise neutron lifetime measurement using pulsed cold neutron beams	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Neutron lifetime; Time projection chamber	TRAP; SIMULATION; LABSOCS; SYSTEM	A new time projection chamber (TPC) was developed for neutron lifetime measurement using a pulsed cold neutron spallation source at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC). Managing considerable background events from natural sources and the beam radioactivity is a challenging aspect of this measurement. To overcome this problem, the developed TPC has unprecedented features such as the use of polyether-ether-ketone plates in the support structure and internal surfaces covered with Li-6-enriched tiles to absorb outlier neutrons. In this paper, the design and performance of the new TPC are reported in detail. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Multi-Sampling Ionization Chamber (MUSIC) for measurements of fusion reactions with radioactive beams	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Active target detector; Multi-Sampling Ionization Chamber; Fusion reactions	TRACKING PROPORTIONAL CHAMBER; RELATIVISTIC HEAVY-IONS; CROSS-SECTIONS	A detection technique for high-efficiency measurements of fusion reactions with low-intensity radioactive beams was developed. The technique is based on a Multi-Sampling Ionization Chamber (MUSIC) operating as an active target and detection system, where the ionization gas acts as both target and counting gas. In this way, we can sample an excitation function in an energy range determined by the gas pressure, without changing the beam energy. The detector provides internal normalization to the incident beam and drastically reduces the measuring Lime. In a first experiment we tested the performance of the technique by measuring the C-10,C-13,C-15 + C-12 fusion reactions at energies around the Coulomb barrier. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Sevon, T				Sevon, Tuomo			A MELCOR model of Fukushima Daiichi Unit 1 accident	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Severe accident; Fukushima accident; MELCOR	REACTOR	A MELCOR model of Fukushima Daiichi Unit I accident was developed. The model is based on publicly available information, and the MELCOR input file is published as Electronic Supplementary data with this paper. In order to reproduce the measured containment pressure, it was necessary to model a leak from the reactor coolant system. Recirculation pump seal leak, starting 5 h after the earthquake, was assumed in this study. The reactor pressure vessel lower head was calculated to fail, and all fuel was discharged to the containment. Almost all of the radioactive noble gases and about 0.05% of the cesium inventory were released to the environment, according to this calculation.

A new approach to nuclear reactor design optimization using genetic algorithms and regression analysis	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Genetic; Algorithm; Reactor; Design; Modular; Optimization	MONTE-CARLO-SIMULATION; FUEL; MAINTENANCE; SYSTEM	A module based optimization method using genetic algorithms (GA), and multivariate regression analysis has been developed to optimize a set of parameters in the design of a nuclear reactor. GA simulates natural evolution to perform optimization, and is widely used in recent times by the scientific community. The GA fits a population of random solutions to the optimized solution of a specific problem. In this work, we have developed a genetic algorithm to determine the values for a set of nuclear reactor parameters to design a gas cooled fast breeder reactor core including a basis thermal hydraulics analysis, and energy transfer. Multivariate regression is implemented using regression splines (RS). Reactor designs are usually complex and a simulation needs a significantly large amount of time to execute, hence the implementation of GA or any other global optimization techniques is not feasible, therefore we present a new method of using RS in conjunction with GA. Due to using RS, we do not necessarily need to run the neutronics simulation for all the inputs generated from the GA module rather, run the simulations for a predefined set of inputs, build a multivariate regression fit to the input and the output parameters, and then use this fit to predict the output parameters for the inputs generated by GA. The reactor parameters are given by the, radius of a fuel pin cell, isotopic enrichment of the fissile material in the fuel, mass flow rate of the coolant, and temperature of the coolant at the core inlet. And, the optimization objectives for the reactor core are, high breeding of U-233 and Pu-239 in desired power peaking limits, desired effective and infinite neutron multiplication factors, high fast fission factor, high thermal efficiency in the conversion from thermal energy to electrical energy using the Brayton cycle, and high fuel burn-up. It is to be noted that we have kept the total mass of the fuel as constant. In this work, we present a module based (modular) approach to perform the optimization wherein, we have defined the following modules: single fuel pin cell, whole core, thermal hydraulics, and energy conversion. In each of the modules we have defined a specific set of parameters and optimization objectives. The GA system (GAS), and RS together, play the role of optimizing each of the individual modules, and integrating the modules to determine the final nuclear reactor core. However, implementation of GA could lead to a local minimum or a non-unique set of parameters, those meet the specific optimization objectives. The GA code is built using Java, neutronic analysis using MCNP6, thermal hydraulics calculations using Java, and regression analysis using R. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hong, SG; Kim, JH; You, W				Hong, Ser Gi; Kim, Jin Hyeong; You, WuSeung			A neutronic design study of lead-bismuth-cooled small and safe ultra-long-life cores	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Ultra-long-life core; Lead-bismuth coolant; Small modular reactor	FAST-REACTOR; NUCLEAR-POWER; FUEL-CYCLE; SODIUM	In this paper, two small ultra-long-life lead-bismuth-cooled cores having 48 and 58 effective full power years (EFPYs) of operation life are neutronically designed, and their core physics characteristics including safety-related parameters are analyzed and inter-compared. Each core's rate is 110 MWt (36 MWe), and they use depleted uranium and thorium blankets, respectively, for achieving ultra-long life and high burnup while the ternary metallic fuels having TRU from LWR spent fuels are adopted as driver fuels. They adopt a low power density for ultra-long life and for considering some possibilities of high peak power density. This work provides a consistent comparison of the effects of the depleted uranium and thorium blankets on the performances of small ultra-long-life lead-bismuth-cooled cores. The results of the detailed neutronic analyses show that the core with depleted uranium has a significantly longer life because of the better breeding characteristics of depleted uranium versus the core with a thorium blanket and that all of the cores have negative reactivity coefficients except for the very small positive coolant expansion reactivity coefficients and low peak linear power densities. Additionally, a detailed decomposition analysis is performed to better understand the effects of coolant voiding on reactivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An additional objective is to establish the tradeoff between the minimum required DPA (displacements per atom) and average required bumup (fuel utilization) for B&B cores spanning a core power range from 1250 to 3500 MWth. It is found possible to design a B&B core fuelled with depleted uranium to have a peak radiation damage at or below 350 DPA when using 3D-shuffling. Relative to conventional 2D-shuffling, 3D-shuffling offers between 30% and 40% reduction in the peak DPA along with up to 30% increase in the average discharge bumup and, hence, in the depleted uranium utilization as well as significant increase in the core average and specific power density. Per DPA, the 3D shuffling option offers up to 60% higher uranium utilization. Even though 350 DPA is above the 200 DPA peak radiation damage HT9 steels were exposed to so far, it is below the 400 DPA advanced structural materials are expected to tolerate.

In this paper, results of modeling radiation doses during the dismantling of the large diameter pipes from the emergency core cooling system of RBMK-1500 reactor at Ignalina NPP are presented. The effective doses to the workers are modeled for four dismantling alternatives in order to propose the optimal dismantling approach. The impacts of the cutting technology and individual respiration protection on effective doses are analyzed. The total effective personnel doses are obtained by summing the effective personnel doses from various sources of exposure, i.e., direct radiation from radioactive equipment, internal radiation due to inhalation and ingestion of radioactive aerosols, and direct radiation from radioactive aerosols arising during hot cutting. The collective effective doses and their uncertainties are analyzed using VISIPLAN and MATLAB codes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Control rods worth computation is a challenge for the full deterministic calculation methodology, including the few group cross section generation, and the core analysis. The purpose of this work is to interpret our codes system, and their applicability of obtaining reliable CRs worth by some engineering adjustments. Cross sections collapsing in three energy groups is made by WIMS and SN2 codes, while the core analysis is performed by CITATION. We use these codes for the design, construction, and operation of our research reactor CMRR (China Mianyang Research Reactor). However, due to the intrinsic deficiency of the diffusion theory and homogenizing approximation, the directly obtained results, such as CRs worth and neutron flux distributions are not satisfactory. So two points of simple adjustments are made to generate the few group cross-sections with the assistance of measurements and auxiliary Monte Carlo runs. The first step is to adjust the fuel cross sections by changing properly the mass of a non-fissile material, such as the mass of the two 0.4 mm Cd wires existing at both sides of each uranium plate, so that the core model of CITATION can get good eigenvalue when all CRs are completely extracted. The second step is to revise the shim absorber cross section of CRs by adjusting the hafnium mass, so that the CITATION model can get correct critical rods position. In this manuscript, the JRR-3M (Japan Research Reactor No. 3 Modified) reactor is employed as a demonstration. Final revised results are validated with the stochastic simulation and experimental measurement values, including the critical rods position, the differential/integral CR curves, and the thermal neutron flux distributions.

Compared with the previous process, an auxiliary molecular sieve bed was added in helium purification regeneration system and new operation process was proposed to collect tritium-containing waste water. In this paper, the optimized process and verification experiment were presented in detail. In commissioning experiment of the improved HTR-10, a large quantity of high-dose tritium-containing waste water was successfully collected in the water separator of helium purification regeneration system, with the specific activity being 6.1 x 10(9) Bq/L. The verification experiment confirms that the optimized process is effective and reliable for the demonstration plant design of High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor-Pebble bed module (HTR-PM) to avoid the large emission of detrimentally radioactive waste water to the environment.

J	St-Aubin, E; Marleau, G				St-Aubin, Emmanuel; Marleau, Guy			Optimized CANDU-6 cell and reactivity device supercell models for advanced fuels reactor database generation	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Cell and supercell calculations; Reactivity devices; Incremental cross sections; CANDU; DRAGON		Several 2D cell and 3D supercell models for reactivity device simulation have been proposed along the years for CANDU-6 reactors to generate 2-group cross section databases for finite core calculations in diffusion. Although these models are appropriate for natural uranium fuel, they are either too approximate or too expensive in terms of computer time to be used for optimization studies of advanced fuel cycles. Here we present a method to optimize the 2D spatial mesh to be used for a collision probability solution of the transport equation for CANDU cells. We also propose a technique to improve the modeling and accelerate the evaluation, in deterministic transport theory, of the incremental cross sections and diffusion coefficients associated with reactivity devices required for reactor calculations.

Velocity characteristic and stability of wave solutions for a candle reactor with thermal feedback	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Nuclear fission wave; Traveling wave reactor; Fast reactor; CANDLE; Stability; Reactivity feedback	FISSION WAVE; CRITICALITY WAVES; BURNUP STRATEGY; DESIGN; CORE; FUEL	We study the stationary nuclear fission wave (NFW) in the CANDLE fission wave reactor analytically and numerically. The focus of this work is to elucidate in a universally applicable way the variation of wave velocity and power with respect to parameters of reactor composition and design. We also study the stability of such waves solving the time-dependent problem numerically. A one-dimensional model of an infinite cylindrical reactor with U-Pu fuel and non burnable absorber is used, including a qualitative model of thermal feedback. A new analytical approach is proposed to determine the velocity of the stationary wave. We show that there are three main mechanisms which determine the wave velocity, and thus, the power and the amplitude of the neutron flux distribution. The thermal feedback mechanism and the mechanism related to the kinetics of Np-239 contribute to wave velocity formation in a similar way. These mechanisms compete together with the effect of slow beta-decay of Pu-241. The latter dominates at lower velocities, leading to instability of the stationary wave solutions and to the existence of a minimal possible velocity of real stationary waves. Negative thermal feedback decreases wave velocity and lowers the upper margin of possible absorber densities. Under realistic conditions, both nuclear density mechanisms and thermal feedback may be important for wave velocity formation in CANDLE reactors with uranium fuel. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Large amount of heat transport with small temperature difference is required. Two-phase thermosyphon loops are suitable for these cases. Flow and heat transfer characteristics of a two-phase thermosyphon loop were numerically investigated using RELAP5 code. Effects of fill charge ratio on the heat transfer were analyzed. The fill charge ratio should be chosen between 30% and 80%, smaller than 30% or larger than 80% will reduce the heat transfer. Based on the analysis of two-phase thermosyphon loops, a complete design of a passive cooling system for the spent fuel pool was proposed. An analysis method for decoupling of the thermo-hydraulics of the water natural circulation in spent fuel pool, two-phase flow of ammonia in thermosyphon loop and air natural circulation in cooling tower was presented. The results indicate that 1528 two-phase thermosyphon loops can passively remove 16 MW decay heat from the spent fuel pool successfully. Finally, the velocity and temperature distributions in the spent fuel pool were numerically simulated using ANSYS FLUENT software. It was proved that natural circulation of water in spent fuel pool can be realized with the present design. The temperature uniformity was fairly well and the maximum water temperature was 81 degrees C. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Liang, F; Liu, XG				Liang, Fan; Liu, Xuegang			Analysis on the characteristics of geologic disposal waste arising from various partitioning and conditioning options	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Nuclear spent fuel; P&C options; Geological repository; Linear loading capacity; Thermal power		Siting a nuclear geological repository entails high economic, social, and political costs. The concept of expanding the capacity of repository is of great interest to the nuclear industry. Partitioning and conditioning (P&C) technology of high level radioactive liquid waste (HLLW) is expected to be effective to mitigate the burden of repository by removal of some elements from disposal waste and reducing the repository size necessitated to emplace the waste forms. The impacts of P&C technology on the characteristics of disposal waste are discussed in this paper. Four P&C options are assumed in the analysis: (1) Spent fuel once through, to dispose spent fuel directly; (2) Conventional reprocessing, to dispose vitrified HLLW glass; (3) Reprocessing plus long-lived nuclides partitioning, to dispose waste streams without minor actinides (MAs), rare earth elements (REs), Tc and Pu; (4) Reprocessing plus high thermal output nuclides separation, to dispose waste streams without Sr&Cs. The partitioning scheme is based on China's TRPO full partitioning process and its experimental results. The waste conditioning and disposal is in accordance with the specifications of Yucca Mountain Repository. The content of disposal waste stream in each option is presented and its characteristics, such as mass, volume, linear loading capacity, thermal power and linear thermal power, are identified.

To secure the stable control of criticality with physical and chemical durability, a neutron absorber was designed and fabricated using borosilicate glass and a rare earth compound. The performance of the developed neutron absorber was evaluated in terms of the: (1) criticality controllability with various artificial rare earth compositions, (2) stability after neutron irradiation generated from the spent fuel, (3) radioactivity of the neutron absorber, and (4) physical and chemical properties. Our results show that the neutron absorber can successfully control the criticality regardless of the artificial rare earth composition. Also, we demonstrate that the neutron absorber can be utilized without any additional radiation shielding of the spent fuel storages for a long period of time (more than 100 years). In addition, analysis shows that the absorber has sufficient physical and chemical strength for use in spent fuel storage. We expect that this study will help to minimize the number of radioactive waste storage sites as well as reduce the disposal costs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An analysis was performed on the feasibility of replacing the uranium in Canada's nuclear reactors with thorium. Thorium only exists as a fertile isotope, and so an external fissile source such as U-235, U-233, or (PU)-P-239 is required to stimulate the fission process. A uranium plant and a similar thorium-fuelled plant were compared over a 40 year operational life based on a comprehensive economic analysis. The results from the economic analysis were used to estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement cost compared to the coal and natural gas-based power. The economic analysis determined that a thorium plant is more financially lucrative in Canada than a uranium plant. An abatement cost assessment in relation to gas-fired and coal-fired power plants demonstrated that nuclear power offers a cost savings per tonne of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gas (GHG) when compared to both fossil fuel alternatives. From the values determined for a plant potentially fuelled on thorium, the abatement cost when compared to the coal-fired and gas-fired plants is -$10.4/tonne-CO(2)eq and -$15.7/tonne-CO(2)eq, respectively.

Investigation of different scenarios of thorium-uranium fuel distribution in the VVER-1200 first core	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Mixed thorium-uranium fuel; Seed-blanket fuel; VVER-1200		Thorium fuel gives some superiority from safeguards point of view and is now being considered as an option for nuclear fuel. It is found to achieve high proliferation resistance because it has significant lower production of plutonium and minor actinides as compared with uranium fuel. The effect of the insertion of thorium, as a part of the nuclear fuel, on the neutronic parameters of the VVER-1200 first core under normal operation was studied. Two different patterns, namely mixed thorium uranium fuel and seed-blanket fuel, were compared. In addition to the amount of the inserted thorium, it was found that the position of the thorium assemblies inside the reactor core plays an important role in determining the effective multiplication factor and hence the core cycle length. It was concluded that the best location of thorium is in the periphery of the reactor core. As the preparation of thorium fuel does not involve all the requirements imposed by the uranium fuel, it is therefore expected that the economical feedback of both uranium-thorium fuels will be also positive, especially for a country with high thorium abundance.

J	Ginting, AB; Liem, PH				Ginting, Aslina Br.; Liem, Peng Hong			Absolute burnup measurement of LEU suicide fuel plate irradiated in the RSG GAS multipurpose reactor by destructive radiochemical technique	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Absolute burnup measurement; Destructive radiochemical technique; U-235; Cs-137; Silicide LEU fuels; RSG GAS	VERIFICATION	Absolute bumup measurements of a sample taken from the IDA0045 fuel plate of RI-SIE2 low enriched uranium, suicide, experimental fuel element irradiated in the Reaktor Serba Guna G.A. Siwabessy (RSG GAS; previous name MPR-30) multipurpose reactor were conducted using destructive radiochemical technique. The destructive bumup measurement effort is an important part of the continuing efforts related to the post irradiation examination (PIE) project of the Indonesian National Nuclear Energy Agency. The amount of 11-235 fissile material left and the Cs-137 fission product in the sample were selected as the bumup indicator for the present work. The measured bumup values of the sample were 72.4 -/+ 4.5% loss of 11-235 and 78.6 -/+ 5.0% loss of U-235 based on the amount of U-235 fissile material and Cs-137 fission product, respectively. The burnup value based on the measured Cs-137 showed an overestimation since it was assumed that all fissions originated from 11-235 thermal fissions. Numerical bumup verification was also conducted using the SRAC2006 code system with a PIE dedicated detail burnup chain and a SRAC library based on the JENDL-3.3 nuclear data. The verification results, combined with the previous nondestructive bumup measurement results on the plate wise and axial distributions of the Cs-134/Cs-137 activity ratio, produced burnup value of 75.0 -/+ 5.0% loss of U-235 which agreed well with the measured values.

The aim is to investigate the nuclear fuel evolution using reprocessed fuel and the neutronic parameters under neutron irradiation. The source multiplication factor and fuel depletion for both systems were analysed during 10 years. The simulations were performed using MONTEBURNS code (MCNP/ORIGEN). The results indicate the main differences when irradiating the fuel with different neutron sources as well as the most suitable system for achieving transmutation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Some theoretical considerations about origins of oscillations are very general, however it may be difficult to apply it easily to other models as a prediction of stability. Physics of HTR core differs significantly from the properties of light water system and the reliable extrapolation of the current numerical results is not possible. Moreover, most of the works concerning HTR bumup calculations put no emphasis on the spatial stability of the simulation and apply very long time steps. The awareness in this field of research seems to be not sufficient. In this paper, we focus on the demonstration of depletion instabilities in the simulations of HTR core dedicated for deep burnup of plutonium and minor actinides. We apply various methodology of time step implemented in advanced Continuous Energy Monte Carlo burnup code MCB version 5. Stability analysis is very rare for the full core calculations and the awareness of the oscillation's problem is obligatory for the reliable modeling of a fuel cycle.

A concrete storage cask to safely store spent nuclear fuel should be able to adequately emit the decay heat from the spent nuclear fuel. Moreover, the concrete storage cask must ensure that the temperatures of the spent nuclear fuel assemblies are maintained within the allowable values for normal, off-normal, and accident conditions. Therefore, the concrete storage cask must be designed to have heat removal capabilities with appropriate reliability. However, the thermal conductivity of concrete is not good and the allowable temperature of concrete is lower than that of steel. In this study, a thermal test was performed to evaluate the heat removal performance of the concrete storage cask under development by KORAD (Korea Radioactive Waste Agency), under normal and off-normal conditions. In addition, a thermal test was performed to evaluate the thermal integrity of the concrete under accident conditions. The heat transfer rate to the ambient atmosphere by convective airflow through the passive heat removal system of the concrete storage cask was found to reach 93.5% under normal conditions. Thus, it was confirmed that the passive heat removal system was well designed and worked adequately. In addition, the heat transfer rate to the ambient atmosphere by convective airflow through the passive heat removal system under off-normal conditions was estimated to reach 87.4%. Therefore, it was deduced that the half-blockage of the inlet openings has a relatively small effect on the maximum temperatures and temperature distributions. Moreover, no significant temperature differences were detected with respect to the location of the half-blockage of the inlet openings. This indicated that, the influence of the direction of the half-blockage of the inlet openings on the heat removal performance was minimal. Finally, the maximum temperature of the over-pack inner surface under accident conditions was measured as 103 degrees C, thus verifying that the thermal integrity of the concrete is adequately maintained under accident conditions.

After a general discussion of SMR developments, in the main section of this paper we present an analysis of a generic sodium-cooled fast reactor designed to sustain an unusual lifetime of 30 years, similar to concepts such as the Toshiba 45. For this reactor, material composition over lifetime is calculated and its material attractiveness compared to (spent) fuel from other reactor types. Depletion calculations show that a significant amount of plutonium is produced over time with an isotopic composition highly attractive for military purposes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wu, X; Kozlowski, T; Hales, JD				Wu, Xu; Kozlowski, Tomasz; Hales, Jason D.			Neutronics and fuel performance evaluation of accident tolerant FeCrAl cladding under normal operation conditions	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						FeCrAl; Accident Tolerant Fuel	HIGH-TEMPERATURE; IRON-ALLOYS; OXIDATION; STEAM	Neutronics and fuel performance analysis is done for enhanced accident tolerance fuel (ATF), with the Monte Carlo reactor physics code Serpent and INL's fuel performance code BISON. The purpose is to evaluate the most promising ATF candidate material FeCrAl, which has excellent oxidation resistance, as fuel cladding under normal operational conditions. Due to several major disadvantages of FeCrAl coating, such as difficulty in fabrication, diametrical compression from reactor pressurization, coating spallation and inter diffusion with zirconium, a monolithic FeCrAl cladding design is suggested. To overcome the neutron penalty expected when using FeCrAl as cladding for current oxide fuel, an optimized FeCrAl cladding design from a detailed parametric study in literature is adopted, which suggests reducing the cladding thickness and slightly increasing the fuel enrichment. A neutronics analysis is done that implementing this FeCrAl cladding design in a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) single assembly. The results show that the PWR cycle length requirements will be matched, with a slight increase in total plutonium production. Fuel performance analysis with BISON code is carried out to investigate the effects with this FeCrAl cladding design. The results demonstrate that the application of FeCrAl cladding could improve performance. For example, the axial temperature profile is flattened. The gap closure is significantly delayed, which means the pellet cladding mechanical interaction is greatly delayed. The disadvantages for monolithic FeCrAl cladding are that: (1) fission gas release is increased: and (2) fuel temperature is increased, but the increase is less than 50 K even at high burnup. The better strength, corrosion, and embrittlement properties of FeCrAl enable the fabrication of FeCrAl cladding with thinner walls. FeCrAl cladding proves to be a good alternate for zircaloy cladding, given the advantages and insignificant disadvantages shown by fuel performance analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

MOX fuel enrichment prediction in PWR using polynomial models	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						PWR MOX; Nuclear fuel fabrication; Model; Fuel cycle		A dynamic fuel cycle simulation code models all the ingoing and outgoing material flow in all facilities of a nuclear reactor's fleet as well as their evolutions through the different nuclear processes (irradiation, decay, chemical separation, etc.). One of the main difficulties encountered when performing such calculation comes from the fuel fabrication of reprocessed fuel such as MOX fuel. Indeed, the MOX fuel is fabricated using a plutonium base completed with depleted uranium. The amount of plutonium in the fuel will directly impact the neutron multiplication factor and its evolution through irradiation, so the duration to keep the fuel in the reactor. The present paper presents the study of different PWR MOX fuel fabrication polynomial models. Those models will allow the prediction of the amount of plutonium needed to reach a wanted burnup from the plutonium isotopics. After defining a method to generate a training sample, that is to say the set of fuel depletion calculations used to fit the polynomial models, this papers will discuss their performances on 3 different applications. On the two tested models, one linear and one quadratic, while the linear model fail to properly describe the amount of plutonium needed, the fuel fabricated, using the quadratic one, reaches the wanted burnup with a discrepancy below 2%.

Simultaneous multiple reactivity insertions in a typical MTR-type research reactor having U3Si2-Al fuel	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Low Enriched Uranium core; Research reactors; U3Si2-Al fuel; Multiple ramp reactivity transient	TRANSIENTS; SIMULATION	Safety assessment for simultaneous multiple reactivity insertions in a typical research reactor having low enriched, high density (U3Si2-Al) fuel has been done using modified PARET code. As a first step, the effect of single reactivity ramps on power and temperatures during transients showed good agreement with already published data. Then simulation of transients for multiple reactivity insertions were carried out and the effects on reactor power, net reactivity of the system, and temperatures (fuel, clad and coolant) were studied. The simultaneous reactivity insertions included ramp reactivity (large and small) and beam tube flooding, a ramp reactivity and a core movement and a ramp reactivity and a sample ejection accident respectively. When simultaneously two different reactivity insertion transients are coupled in the reactor under uncontrolled conditions, the self-control of the reactor decreases. The power and temperatures show several peaks and it oscillates along with the net reactivity of the system within the first second of the accident. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Optimization of U-Th fuel in heavy water moderated thermal breeder reactors using multivariate regression analysis and genetic algorithms	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Thorium; Uranium; Parametric; Optimization; Regression; Predictive	MONTE-CARLO-SIMULATION; NUCLEAR-FUEL; INDIAN PHWR; MAINTENANCE; DESIGN; SYSTEM	An analysis and optimization of a set of neutronics parameters of a thorium-fueled pressurized heavy water reactor core fuel has been performed. The analysis covers a detailed pin-cell analysis of a seed-blanket configuration, where the seed is composed of natural uranium, and the blanket is composed of thorium. Genetic algorithms (GA) is used to optimize the input parameters to meet a specific set of objectives related to: infinite multiplication factor, initial breeding ratio, and specific nuclide's effective microscopic cross-section. The core input parameters are the pitch-to-diameter ratio, and blanket material composition. Recursive partitioning of decision trees (rpart) multivariate regression model is used to perform a predictive analysis of the samples generated from the GA module. Reactor designs are usually complex and a simulation needs a significantly large amount time to execute, hence implementation of GA or any other global optimization techniques is not feasible, therefore we present a new method of using rpart in conjunction with GA. Due to using rpart, we do not necessarily need to run the neutronics simulation for all the inputs generated from the GA module rather, run the simulations for a predefined set of inputs, build a regression fit to the input and the output parameters, and then use this fit to predict the output parameters for the inputs generated by GA. The rpart model is implemented as a library using R programming language. The results suggest that the initial breeding ratio tends to increase due to a harder neutron spectrum, however a softer neutron spectrum is desired to limit the parasitic absorption of Pa-233. The neutronics model, design and analysis have been done using Serpent 1.1.19 Monte Carlo code. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the first step of the calculation procedure, a series of neutronic calculations were made in order to find the proper mixture ratios for these fertile fuel mixtures by using MCNP5 with ENDF/B-VI cross-section library. After the determination of these mixture ratios, in order to compare these fuel mixtures, time dependent neutronic calculations were made by using Monteburns 2.0 with MCNP5 and Origen 2.2. According to the results obtained, different parameters (operation time, burnup value, fissile isotope production, etc.) were compared. Results of the first step showed that, in order to reach the reference k(eff) value, 690.6 kg more fissile isotope was used in natural uranium mixture than the thorium mixture. In the second step of this study, time dependent calculations showed that for the natural uranium mixture, operation time and burnup values were found as 1935 days and 177.76 GWd/MTU, respectively, while these values for thorium mixture were 1925 days and 153.95 GWd/MTU.

On the way to enabling FRAPCON-3 to model spent fuel under dry storage conditions: The thermal evolution	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Dry storage; FRAPCON-3; Cladding thermal modelling	BURNUP	During dry storage cladding degrading mechanisms can affect fuel rod state and, subsequently, any fuel management necessary to be conducted at the later stage. The thermal effect on phenomena like creep and hydrogen embrittlement is well known, so that any prediction of cladding mechanical performance requires an accurate estimate of clad temperature. In this work a theoretical correlation of temperature in dry storage with burnup (33-63 GWd/tU) and out-of-reactor time (up to 300 years) has been derived based on an ad-hoc methodology relying on 3D thermo-fluid dynamics analyses. The law has been implemented in the so called FRAPCON-3xt. The significance of this enhancing feature has been demonstrated by setting comparisons in terms of clad creep and ductile-to-brittle transition (DBT) when a reference thermal evolution is adopted. Particularly, the prediction of time-to-DBT is notably affected. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Feria, F.; Herranz, L.

Validation study of the reactor physics lattice transport code WIMSD-5B by TRX and BAPL critical experiments of light water reactors	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Validation; TRX-BAPL benchmark lattices; Integral parameters; WIMSD-5B code; TRIGA		The aim of this analysis is to validate the reactor physics lattice transport code WIMSD-5B by TRX (thermal reactor-one region lattice) and BAPL (Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory-one region lattice) critical experiments of light water reactors for neutronics analysis of 3 MW TRIGA Mark-II research reactor at AERE, Dhaka, Bangladesh. This analysis is achieved through the analysis of integral parameters of five light water reactor critical experiments TRX-1, TRX-2, BAPL-UO2-1, BAPL-UO2-2 and BAPL-UO2-3 based on evaluated nuclear data libraries JEFF-3.1 and ENDF/B-VII.1. In integral measurements, these experiments are considered as standard benchmark lattices for validating the reactor physics lattice transport code WIMSD-5B as well as evaluated nuclear data libraries. The integral parameters of the said critical experiments are calculated using the reactor physics lattice transport code WIMSD-5B. The calculated integral parameters are compared to the measured values as well as the earlier published MCNP results based on the Chinese evaluated nuclear data library CENDL-3.0 for assessment of deterministic calculation. It was found that the calculated integral parameters give mostly reasonable and globally consistent results with the experiment and the MCNP results. Besides, the group constants in WIMS format for the isotopes U-235 and U-238 between two data files have been compared using WIMS library utility code WILLIE and it was found that the group constants are well consistent with each other. Therefore, this analysis reveals the validation study of the reactor physics lattice transport code WIMSD-5B based on JEFF-3.1 and ENDF/B-VII.1 libraries and can also be essential to execute more neutronics analysis of 3 MW TRIGA Mark II research reactor at AERE, Savar, Dhaka, Bangladesh.

J	Kim, KO; Jo, D				Kim, Kyung-O; Jo, Daeseong			Analysis of Doppler coefficients for typical PWR UO2 and MTR U3Si2-Al fuels using ENDF/B-VI and VII	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Doppler coefficient; PWR UO2; MTR U3Si2-Al; ENDF/B-VI; ENDF/B-VII	URANIUM	This study was performed to evaluate the Doppler coefficients for two types of uranium fuels and to investigate the effect of the neutron cross-section on these evaluations. A series of calculations was performed using MCNP6.1 and KENO6 codes which are three-dimensional neutron transport codes based on Monte Carlo method. The typical PWR UO2 lattice and the Material Testing Reactor (MTR) U3Si2-Al lattice were considered as fuel models of this study. The latest cross-sections (ENDF/B-VI and VII) at the desired temperatures were also generated from the makxsf code, and applied to the MCNP calculations. As a result, there were some differences (about 300-400 pcm) among the neutron multiplication factors (k(eff)) at each enrichment because of the codes and nuclear data used in these evaluations. Although the Doppler coefficient was changed to be less negative with increasing uranium enrichment regardless of types of nuclear fuel, their behaviors were significantly different between those. The Doppler coefficient for UO2 fuel followed an asymptotic curve, while the coefficient for the other followed an exponential curve which more significantly became less negative with increasing uranium enrichment. Also, the Doppler coefficient for UO2 fuel was about 2 times more negative than those for U3Si2-Al fuel. It was estimated that additional study was required for investigating the cause of occurrence because there was a difference more than two standard deviation (2 sigma) between the Doppler coefficients derived from different cross-sections at some enrichments.

Study the effects of different reflector types on the neutronic parameters of the 10 MW MTR reactor using the MCNP4C code	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						10 MW MTR; Reflectors; k(eff); Neutron flux; Distribution		A 3-D neutronic model for the 10 MW MTR research reactor has been conducted for the HEU (93%), MEU (45%) and LEU (20%) fuels using the MCNP4C code. This model has been used to study the effect of different types of reflector materials on the reactor multiplication factor and neutron flux distribution in the reactor. It was found that the beryllium reflector was the most efficient reflector among the studied reflector groups (beryllium, heavy water, graphite and light water) since it gave the highest reactor multiplication factor, 1.21441. It followed by heavy water, graphite and light water with the following reactor multiplication factors: 1.19458, 1.19287 and 1.16867 respectively. The graphite reflector gave the highest maximum thermal neutron flux in the water trap, 2.576E14 n cm(-2) s(-1). It followed by heavy water, light water, and beryllium with the following results: 2.533E14, 2.526E14 and 2.525E14 n cm(-2) s(-1) respectively. Considerable gains in reactivity were not appreciably influenced by changing the fuel enrichment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Feasibility assessment of the once-through thorium fuel cycle for the PTVM LWR concept	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Pressure tube reactor; "Breed & burn"; Moderator variation; Seed-blanket geometry; Once-through thorium fuel cycle	DESIGN	This paper investigates the feasibility of a once-through thorium fuel cycle for the novel reactor-design concept named the pressure tube light water reactor with variable moderator control (PTVM LWR). The PTVM LWR operates in a "breed & burn" mode, which makes it an attractive system for utilizing thorium fuel in a once-through mode. The "breed & burn" mode can emphasize the in situ generation as well as incineration of U-233, which are the basic foundations of the once-through thorium fuel cycle. The PTVM LWR concept makes use of a seed blanket geometry, whereby the core is divided into separated regions of thorium-based fuel channel assemblies (blanket) and low-enriched uranium (LEU) based fuel channel assemblies (seed). A novel fuel in-core management scheme based on two separate fuel flow routes (i.e., seed route and blanket route) is proposed and analyzed. Neutronic performance analysis indicates that the proposed novel fuel in-core management scheme has the potential to utilize both LEU- and thorium-based fuel in an efficient manner. The once-through thorium cycle, presented and discussed in this paper, provide interesting research leads and can serve as a bridge between current LEU-based fuel cycles and a thorium fuel cycle based on recycling of U-233.

It is shown that an appropriate physics-based correction successfully removes the bias. It depends on four correction coefficients which can only be exactly determined if the sample geometry and composition are known. In some cases, for example in warhead authentication, available information on the sample will be very MCNPX-PoliMi simulations have been performed to obtain the correction coefficients for a range of spherical plutonium metal geometries, with and without polyethylene reflection placed around the spheres. For hollow spheres, the analysis shows that the correction coefficients can be approximated with high accuracy as a function of the sphere's thickness depending only slightly on the radius. If the thickness remains unknown, less accurate estimates of the correction coefficients can be obtained from the neutron multiplication. The influence of isotopic composition is limited. The correction coefficients become somewhat smaller when reflection is present. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the large accelerator and a big Q3D magnetic spectrometer, the measurement method for Ni-59 and Ni-63 is under development at the AMS facility at China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE). By using the Delta E-Q3D technique with the Q3D magnetic spectrometer, the isobaric interferences were greatly reduced in the measurements of Ni-59 and Ni-63. A four anode gas ionization chamber was then used to further identify isobars. With these techniques, the abundance sensitivities of Ni-59 and Ni-63 measurements are determined as Ni-59/Ni = 1 x 10(-13) and Ni-63/Ni = 2 x 10(-12), respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The AMS system is versatile, based on a 5 MV tandem Pelletron-type accelerator. Since its establishment in 1997, the AMS system has been used for measurement of carbon-14 (C-14) mainly for C-14 dating studies in neotectonics and hydrogeology, in support of JAEA's research on geosphere stability applicable to the long-term isolation of high-level radioactive waste. Results of the measurement of C-14 in soils and plants has been applied to the dating of fault activity and volcanism. Development of beryllium-10 (Be-10) and aluminum-26 (Al-26) AMS systems are now underway to enhance the capability of the multi-nuclide AMS in studies of dating by cosmogenic nuclides. The Be-10-AMS system has already been used for routine measurements in applied studies and improvements of the measurement technique have been made. Now we plan to fine tune the system and perform test measurements to develop the Al-26-AMS system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Currently, a multi-nuclide AMS (Be-10, C-14, Al-26, Cl-36, I-129) system is available and shows good performance in both precision and sensitivity, and the accelerator serves for PIXE, NRA, ERDA/RBS measurements as well. The total operation time of the accelerator has been over 95,000 hours since the start of MALT, 20 years ago. After the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident, many projects related to I-129 have been conducted. The retrospective reconstruction of the I-131 distribution at the accident from I-129 is one of the most important missions for dose evaluation of the residents. The accident-derived I-129 is also quite useful as a tracer for the general iodine dynamics in the environment. As a new tool for environmental assessment related to nuclear activity, including the global fallout from past atmospheric nuclear bomb testing, effects from the spent fuel reprocessing plant, and nuclear accidents such as Chernobyl and FDNPP, a U-236-AMS system is now under development.
