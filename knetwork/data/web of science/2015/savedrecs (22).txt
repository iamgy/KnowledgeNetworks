Usage of HPGe detectors for radioactivity measurements in the environment or for nuclear safeguard applications, to combat illicit trafficking of nuclear materials or uranium and plutonium monitoring in nuclear wastes, has become a norm in the recent years. Portable HPGe-based radionuclide spectrometer with electrical cooling has lately appeared on the market for in situ applications. At the same time deterioration of energy resolution associated with vibrations produced by cryocooler or high weight of the instrument, short time of autonomous operation and high price of these spectrometers are limiting their usage in many cases. In this paper we present development results of ultra compact hand held all-in-one spectrometer for in situ measurements based on HPGe detector cooled by liquid nitrogen without listing the above disadvantages.

The gamma induced reactions on some of the human essential elements are studied to show the probability of changes of nuclei. The Talys 1.4 toolkit was adopted as the theoretical model for calculation. The reactions investigated include the (gamma, n) and (gamma, p) channels for the stable Na, Mg, Cl, K, Ca, and Fe isotopes, with the incident energy of gamma ranging from 1 to 30 MeV. It was found that the cross sections for the reactions are very low, and the maximum cross section is no larger than 100 mb. By considering the threshold energy of the channel, the half-life time of the residue nucleus, and the percentage of the element accounting for the weight and its importance in the body, it is suggested to track the radioactive nuclei Na-22, Ca-41, and K-42,K-43 after gamma therapy. The results might be useful for medical diagnosis and disease treatment.

Different from the regular aqueous radioactive wastes, these liquids possess a higher hazard potential and cannot be disposed through the conventional methods due to their radioactivity and chemical nature. Spent extraction solvent is a kind of common liquid organic radioactive wastes. In this work, tri-butyl phosphate (TBP), which is more difficult to degrade in the spent extraction solvent, was used as the model compound. Influences of reaction conditions on total organic carbon (TOC) removal and the volume percentage of each gas component under supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) were studied. The SCWO behaviors of spent extraction solvent simulants were studied under the optimal conditions derived from the TBP experiment. The SCWO experiments were studied at 400-550 degrees C, oxidant stoichiometric ratio of 0-200%, feed concentration of 1.5%-4% and pressure of 25 MPa for 15-75 s. The results show that the TOG removal of the simulants was greater than 99.7% and CH4, H-2 and CO were not detected at 550 degrees C, 25 MPa, oxidant stoichiometric ratio of 150%, feed concentration of 3%, and residence time of 30s.

The adsorbent was used to uptake iodide anions (I-) by batch and column techniques. The kinetic and saturated adsorption experiments were carried out by varying the shaking times and initial concentration of I-. Experimental results shown that the kinetic adsorption of I- was controlled by a pseudo second order model and the saturated adsorption of I- was controlled by the chemisorption mechanism, which followed a Langmuir adsorption equation. The breakthrough curve of I had a S-shaped profile. The column efficiency was estimated to be over 90%.

Presented is an analysis and recommendations based on measurement results obtained in the underground caves over the past 12 y. The most important results for cave environments were as follows: integral radon monitoring using RAMARN detectors can provide more consistent results for calculating the effective dose; no major differences were shown in the average radon activity concentration during working time as opposed to non-working time; the unattached fraction of radioactive particles in air ranged from 0.03 to 0.6, with arithmetical average f(p) = 0.13; the direct dependence between equilibrium factor F and the size of the unattached fraction f(p) was described using the Log-Power expression ln(1/f(p)) 5 a*ln(1/F)(b); the calculated values for coefficients a and b were 1.85 and -1.096, respectively. The individual cave factor for each investigated underground area was calculated.

As a part of this radiological survey, this article presents results obtained from Egrigoz pluton, which lies in the northeastern region of Western Anatolia. In the investigated area, the activity measurements of the natural gamma-emitting radionuclides (Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40) in the granitic rock samples and soils have been carried out by means of the NaI(Tl) gamma-ray spectrometry system. The activity concentrations of the relevant natural radionuclides in the granite samples appeared in the ranges as follows: Ra-226, 28-95 Bq kg(-1); Th-232, 50-122 Bq kg(-1) and K-40, 782-1365 Bq kg(-1), while the typical ranges of the Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 activities in the soil samples were found to be 7-184, 11-174 and 149-1622 Bq kg(-1), respectively. Based on the available data, the radiation hazard parameters associated with the surveyed rocks/soils are calculated. The corresponding absorbed dose rates in air from all those radionuclides were always much lower than 200 nGy h(-1) and did not exceed the typical range of worldwide average values noted in the UNSCEAR (2000) report. Furthermore, the data are also used for the mapping of the surface soil activity of natural radionuclides and the corresponding gamma dose rates of the surveyed area.	[Ozturk, B. Canbaz; Cam, N.

While radioactivity is normally measured through the ionising radiation produced during the spontaneous decay of unstable atoms, selected radionuclides or their chemical elements can be quantified with instrumental techniques based on stimulated emission or counting of atoms. The advantages and disadvantages of these analytical methods are discussed. Particular attention is paid to X-ray fluorescence analysis of materials containing uranium and thorium. It is also possible to determine the area distributions of these chemical elements in samples with the use of scanning X-ray fluorescence systems.

A COLIBRI TTC survey metre with an SABG-15+ probe (Canberra, USA) was purchased for this purpose. The probe is designed for surface contamination measurements, and it is intended to measure the activity of aerosols deposited on the filters during experiments in the RAC. Since the probe is calibrated in a different geometry, its response in the authors' experimental geometry was simulated by a Monte Carlo method. The authors present a Monte Carlo model using MCNPX and an experimental verification of this probe model.

A total of 25 locations were chosen for the study at Kalpakkam. Ambient radiation levels were monitored prior to collection of samples, which were subjected to gamma spectrometry. While U-238 concentration was found to be below detectable limit, the activities of Th-232 and K-40 were varying from 34.53 to 1093.11 Bq kg(-1) and 36.6 to 570.08 Bq kg(-1), respectively. The radium equivalent activities (Ra-eq) were in the range of 83-1574 Bq kg(-1). There was no appreciable radon exhalation, and the thoron surface exhalation rate varied from 942 to 7720 Bq m(-2) h(-1). The annual effective dose was ranging from 0.05 to 0.81 mSv y(-1). Good correlation was observed between Th-232 content and thoron exhalation rate. The details of the study are presented in this article.	[Sundar, S.

The great number of involved parameters and processes affecting the emanation of radon from the soil grains and its transport in the source medium has led to many theoretical and/or laboratory studies. The authors report the first results of a laboratory study carried out at the Radioactivity Laboratory of the Department of Physics and Astronomy (University of Catania) by means of a facility for measuring radon concentrations in the sample pores at various depths under well-defined and controlled conditions of physical parameters. In particular, radon concentration vertical profiles extracted in low-moisture samples for different advective fluxes and temperatures were compared with expected concentrations, according to a three-phase transport model developed by Andersen (Riso National Laboratory, Denmark), showing, in general, a good agreement between measurements and model calculations.

The accumulation chambers with hollow headspace and chambers with activated charcoal are the most used devices for these purposes. Systematic errors of the measurements strongly depend on the geometry of the chamber and diffusion coefficient of the radon in soil. The calibration system for the attestation of devices for radon flux measurements was constructed. The calibration measurements of accumulation chambers and chambers with activated charcoal were conducted. The good agreement between the results of 2D modelling of radon flux and measurements results was observed. It was demonstrated that reliable measurements of radon flux can be obtained by chambers with activated charcoal (equivalent volume similar to 75 l) or by accumulation chambers with hollow headspace of similar to 7-10 l and volume/surface ratio (height) of >15 cm.

The literature Eatough (Alpha-particle dosimetry for the basal layer of the skin and the radon progeny Po-218 and Po-214. Phys. Med. Biol. 1997;42:1899-1911.) suggests that the alphas from the short-lived radon daughters, Po-218 and Po-214, may reach the basal layer of the epidermis, which is believed to be important in the induction of skin cancers. The deposition of the alphas from the Po-218 and Po-214 daughters was investigated using PADC detector material. The expectation would be that no alpha particles would penetrate through the dead skin layer, assuming the average of 70 microns used in radiation protection, but the skin around the collar bone could potentially be thinner than the assumed average. It should be noticed that by inserting a slice of pig skin in between the necklace and the PADC, no great excess of alpha tracks were seen after 1 week of exposure in the freezer. There was, however, a clear signal through the pig skin from beta particles, confirming the potential of a uranium bead necklace posing a health risk.	[Hansen, M. F.; Moss, G.

The two largest contributors to indoor radon are radon in soil gas, formed from the rocks and soil surrounding the home, and building materials such as aggregate. This study measured the surface radon exhalation rates for 35 aggregate samples collected from producers across Canada. The radon exhalation rates ranged from 2.3 to 479.9 Bq m(-2) d(-1), with a mean of 80.7 +/- 112 Bq m(-2) d(-1). Using a simple, conservative analysis, the aggregate contribution to radon concentrations in an unfinished basement was determined. The maximum estimated radon concentration was 32.5 +/- 2.7 Bq m(-3), or similar to 16 % of the Canadian Radon Guideline. It can be concluded that under normal conditions radon exhalation from aggregate contributes very little to the total radon concentration in indoor air.

Investigation of Experimental Dispersion Fuel Elements with an Aluminum-Based Matrix for High-Flux Research Reactors	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								A variant of experimental dispersion fuel elements with fuel based on uranium dioxide as fissile material in a silumin matrix, which have been proposed for modernizing the core of the SM reactor and are irradiated in a wide spectrum of neutron-physical and thermophysical parameters in the reflector channel of the reactor, is investigated. A nonuniformity with fuel density two times higher than the average over a fuel element, viz., a cluster of uranium dioxide particles in the central zone of the kernel, has been found in the distribution of the fuel phase in the fuel elements. The thermophysical calculations show that for such a distribution of fuel particles the temperature of the fuel composition with heat flux density from the fuel-element surface > 6 MW/m(2) can reach the melting temperature of the matrix. This is confirmed by investigations of fuel elements with appreciably larger volume and shape change. To increase the serviceability of the fuel elements, ways of improving their design and the material composition of the fuel mix are proposed.	[Gil'mutdinov, I. F.; Shishin, V. Yu.; Starkov, V.

It is found that as the grains increase in size their Young's modulus and the microhardness increase and the fracture toughness decreases. It is determined that for relatively small loads (to 1 kg) the formation of Palmqvist cracks is characteristic for uranium oxide pellets, and in the case of large grains they propagate freely over a large distance right through grains (transcrystallite propagation) while for small grains they propagate predominately along grain boundaries with branching (intercrystallite propagation).

Purification and Enrichment of Regenerated Uranium in a Double Cascade	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The effi ciency of two cascades is investigated on the basis of a computational experiment: in the fi rst one regenerated uranium is purifi ed and in the second one low-enrichment uranium is produced from the purifi ed waste of the fi rst one. It is shown that the use of R cascades for purifi cation makes it possible to reduce the content of U-232,U-234 considerably, but it leads to high U-235 concentration 60-90% in the steps. To eliminate this, the purifi cation by removal of U-232,U-234 should be done in optimal cascades, calculated according to the data obtained with the R cascades, with the feed shifted into the product step. This makes it possible to reduce the U-235 content in the steps of the cascade to 20% or less. The quality of the lowenrichment uranium produced from the purifi ed regenerated uranium can be improved by using dilution and enrichment operations, which make it possible to reduce the U-236 content.

Researchers around the globe are investigating alternative methods of production, mainly using accelerators. This paper presents a concept feasibility study of a novel technique dubbed nSPECT, in which non-radioactive isotopes administered to patients would be activated with slow neutrons to emit prompt gamma rays (PGNA). Although a common technique of elemental analysis, PGNA has not been used for medical imaging. This paper presents SPECT images of I-131 at activity levels that could be reasonably produced by neutron activation of Sm-149 in vivo. Simulated Compton noise from hydrogen was added to degrade the images to levels that would be expected in practice. Advantages of nSPECT are discussed.

It is also critical for time-of-flight (TOF) image reconstruction. Here, we use a thin annular cylinder (shell) phantom filled with a radioactive source and located axially and centrally in a PET camera for the timing alignment of a TOF PET system. This timing alignment method involves measuring the time differences between the selected coincidence detector pairs, calibrating the differential and integral nonlinearity of the time-to-digital converter (TDC) with the same raw data and deriving the intrinsic time biases for each detector using an iterative algorithm. The raw time bias for each detector is downloaded to the front-end electronics and the residual fine time bias can be applied during the TOF list-mode reconstruction. Our results showed that a timing alignment accuracy of better than +/- 25 ps can be achieved, and a preliminary timing resolution of 473 ps (full width at half maximum) was measured in our prototype TOF PET/CT system.

The target was exposed unshielded, and shielded with borated high-density polyethylene, or steel, and delayed gamma-ray and neutron signatures were measured. We found that a high confidence measurement of the delayed emission could be obtained in this environment and show the results from each detector array, for varying amounts of shielding, in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio vs. time and the relationship between the mean of the signal-to-noise ratio vs. areal mass density.

While the activation products are relatively shortlived, personnel entering the accelerator room may inhale some radioactive air, which warrants internal dosimetry assessments. This work illustrates a method based on the use of ammonium nitrate solutions for the evaluation of photon-induced air activation and for the estimate of internal doses to radiotherapy personnel. Air activation and internal dosimetry assessments based on our method are presented for some widespread radiotherapy linear accelerator models. Our results indicate that the equivalent dose to the lungs of radiotherapy personnel is negligible for beam energies below 18 MeV.

Radiological and chemical toxicity due to ingestion of uranium through drinking water in the environment of Bangalore, India	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article						uranium; laser fluorimeter; radiological and chemical toxicity; risk; dose	GROUNDWATER	Groundwater samples collected from 96 bore wells in the study area (city of Bangalore) were analysed for concentration of natural uranium using laser-induced fluorimetry. The risk to the population of the region associated with radiological and chemical toxicity of uranium due to its ingestion through drinking water over a lifetime was estimated. The concentration of uranium was found to be in the range 0.136 to 2027.5 mu g L-1 with an average value of 92.42 mu g L-1. In the present study, about 61% of the samples show concentrations of uranium within the safe limit of 30 mu g L-1 as set by the world health organisation. The radiological risk estimated as lifetime cancer risk is in the range 4.3 x 10(-7) to 6.4 x 10(-3) with an average of 2.9 x 10(-4). The chemical toxicity risk measured as lifetime average daily dose is found to range from 0.005 to 75.42 mu g kg(-1) d(-1). The reference dose estimated as 1.12 mu g kg(-1) d(-1) was used to assess the chemical toxicity. The results indicate that the chemical toxicity due to ingestion of uranium through drinking water is of more concern than the radiological toxicity. The present study, being the first of its kind in this region, will augment the database of uranium in groundwater.	[Mathews, Gladys; Nagaiah, N.; Kumar, M. B. Karthik; Ambika, M.

J	Youngman, MJ				Youngman, M. J.			Review of methods to measure internal contamination in an emergency	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Review						internal; contamination; emergencies; monitoring; screening; thyroid; whole body	WHOLE-BODY COUNTER; SITUATIONS	In the event of a radiation emergency, people close to the site of the incident may be exposed to radiation by external exposure, or as a result of intakes of radioactive material. For these incidents it may be necessary to monitor members of the public both for external and internal contamination. This work reviews currently available equipment for the assessment of internal exposure following an emergency. It concentrates on incidents involving the spread of radioactive material and on contamination by radionuclides which emit penetrating radiation. It is essential that this monitoring is carried out as soon as possible so that people who have been exposed at a level which could have an effect on health can be identified and receive prompt medical assessment. Proposed action levels to identify people who need medical attention are reviewed to determine the required sensitivity of monitoring equipment. For releases containing gamma-ray emitting radionuclides the best means of measuring internal contamination is to use detectors placed close to the body (whole body or partial body monitoring). Laboratory based whole body monitors could be used but these may well be inconveniently located and so equipment which can be deployed to the site of an incident has been developed and these are described. The need for rapid selection and prioritisation of people for monitoring, methods to deal with potentially high numbers of contaminated people and the requirement for a means of rapidly interpreting monitoring information are also discussed. It has been found that for many types of incidents and scenarios, systems based on unshielded high-resolution detectors and hand-held instruments do have the required sensitivity to identify people who require medical assessment.

A panorama coded-aperture gamma camera optimized for use in complex nuclear environment has been developed and evaluated with an angular resolution of 3.5 degrees. Typical gamma cameras have the limited field of view ranging from 10 degrees to 60 degrees in both horizontal and vertical direction. The system presented in this paper extends the field of view to 360 degrees in the horizontal direction and 60 degrees in the vertical direction. The partial encoding of coded aperture imaging is mitigated by convolving the data of diverse adjacent modules with a partial transmission function. The experimental feasibility of measuring multiple sources in the 360 degrees horizontal field of view was demonstrated with a panoramic image. The results showed that the system could clearly identify the direction of multiple radiation sources in an unknown extended radiation environment The system can help to simplify the clean up and decommissioning of nuclear sites.

The effect of isotope on the dynamic behavior of < 100 > vacancy-type dislocation loop in deuterium-implanted Fe	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						Dislocation loop; In situ TEM; "Inside-outside" method; Deuterium	SELF-INTERSTITIAL ATOM; HEAVY-ION IRRADIATIONS; ELECTRON-IRRADIATION; DAMAGE EVOLUTION; RADIATION-DAMAGE; FERRITIC STEEL; THIN-FOILS; PURE IRON; CLUSTERS; DEFECT	The dynamic behavior of individual loops of the both interstitial and vacancy types is believed to be strongly connected to the degradation processes that affect radiation-resistant materials used in nuclear-fission and fusion devices. Meanwhile, the isotopic effect of hydrogen on irradiation damage has attracted wide interest. In situ transmission electron microscopy investigation of the dynamic behavior of dislocation loops under high-energy electron irradiation was carried out in pure Fe with deuterium implantation at room temperature and aged at different temperatures. Shrinkage of dislocation loop was observed in implanted sample annealed at 753 K, except the popular growth of dislocation loop. The loop shrinkage was also observed in H implanted sample annealed at relatively lower temperature. The shrinking loop is identified to be < 100 > vacancy-type loop by acknowledged "inside-outside" method. Origin for the dynamic behavior of both type loops and the isotopic effect on the behavior were discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Liu, P. P.; Zhu, Y. M.; Zhao, M. Z.; Jiang, S.

Tritium breeding mock-up experiments containing lithium titanate ceramic pebbles and lead irradiated with DT neutrons	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						Tritium self-sufficiency; Tritium production rate; Liquid scintillation counting; Breeding blanket mock-up	BLANKET; ITER; PROGRESS	Experiments were conducted with breeding blanket mock-up consisting of two layers of breeder material lithium titanate pebbles and three layers of pure lead as neutron multiplier. The radial dimensions of breeder, neutron multiplier and structural material layers are similar to the current design of the Indian Lead Lithium cooled Ceramic Breeder (LLCB) blanket. The mock-up assembly was irradiated with 14 MeV neutrons from DT neutron generator. The local tritium production rates (TPR) from Li-6 and Li-7 in breeder layers were measured with the help of two different compositions of Li isotopes (60.69% Li-6 and 7.54% Li-6) in Li2CO3. Tritium production in the multiplication layers were also measured with above mentioned two types of pellets to compare the experimental tritium production with calculations. TPR from Li at one location in the breeder layer was also measured by direct online measurement of tritons from Li-6(n, t)He-4 reaction using silicon surface barrier detector and Li-6 to triton converter. Additional verification of neutron spectra (E-n > 0.35 MeV) in the mock-up zones were obtained by measuring In-115(n, n)(115m) in reaction rate and comparing it with calculated values in all five layers of mock-up. All the measured nuclear responses were compared with transport calculations using code MCNP with FENDL2.1 and FENDL3.0 cross-section libraries. The average C/E ratio for tritium production in enriched Li2CO3 pellets was 1.11 in first breeder zone and 1.09 in second breeder zone with uncertainty 8.3% at 1 sigma level. The experimental details and results are discussed in this paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Jakhar, Shrichand; Abhangi, M.; Tiwari, S.; Chaudhari, V.; Swami, H.

Significant tritium inventory accumulated in beryllium as a result of neutron-induced transmutations could become a safety issue for the operation of such blankets as well as for the nuclear waste utilization. To provide a related materials database, a neutron,irradiation campaign of beryllium pebbles with diameters of 0.5 and 1 mm at 686-1006K, the HIDOBE-01 experiment, has been performed in the HFR in Petten, the Netherlands, producing up to 3020 appm helium and 298 appm tritium. Thermal desorption tests of irradiated unconstrained and constrained beryllium pebbles were performed in a purge gas flow using a quadrupole mass-spectrometer (QMS) and an ionization chamber. Compared to unconstrained pebbles, constrained beryllium pebbles have an enhanced tritium release at all temperatures investigated. Small elongated sub-grains formed under irradiation in the constrained pebbles promote formation of numerous channels for facilitated tritium release. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Lithium orthosilicate (Li4SiO4) is one of these materials and has been recommended by many ITER research teams as the first selection for the solid tritium breeder. In this paper, the fabrication of Li4SiO4 pebbles used as tritium breeder by a graphite bed method was studied for the first time. Ceramic powders and deionized water were mixed and ball milled to obtain homogeneous suspensions. And then the ceramic suspensions were dispersed on spread graphite powder through nozzles. Spherical droplets with highly uniform size were formed by the surface tension of the liquid droplets. The droplets converted into green pebbles after drying. After calcination and sintering, Li4SiO4 pebbles with desired size and shape were prepared. The obtained Li4SiO4 pebbles had narrow size distribution and favorable sphericity. Thermal analysis, phase analysis and microstructure observation of the pebbles were carried out systematically. Properties of the prepared pebbles were also characterized for crushing load strength, density and porosity, etc. The values were found to be conforming to the desired properties for used as solid breeder.

Tritium self-sufficiency is one of the most important issues for CFETR and the tritium breeding ratio (TBR) is recommended not less than 1.2. As one of the candidates, a helium cooled solid breeder blanket for CFETR superconducting tokamak option was proposed. In the concept, radial arranged U-shaped breeding zones are adopted for higher TBR and simpler structure. In this work, three-dimensional neutronics design and analysis of the blanket were performed using the Monte Carlo N-Particle transport code MCNP with IAEA data library FENDL-2.1. Tritium breeding capability of the proposed blanket was assessed and the breeding zones parallel to first wall (FIN) and perpendicular to FW were optimized. Meanwhile, the nuclear heating analysis and shielding performance were also presented for later thermal and structural analysis. The results showed that the blanket could well meet the tritium self-sufficiency target and the neutron shield could satisfy the design requirements. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The computational results indicated that the dehydrogenation of tritiated methane is endothermic. The decomposition of tritiated methane catalyzed by Ni to form Ni-based carbon (Ni-C) after a four-step dehydrogenation companied with releasing tritium. After the first and second dehydrogenation steps, Ni+CT4 formed NiCT2. After the third and fourth dehydrogenation steps, NiCT2 formed NiC. The first and second steps of dehydrogenation occurred on both the singlet and triplet states, and the lowest energy route is Ni + CT4 -> (COM)-C-1 -> (TS1)-T-1 -> (IM1)-I-3 -> (TS2)-T-3 -> (IM2)-I-3. The third and fourth steps of dehydrogenation occurred on both the singlet and quintet states, and the minimum energy reaction pathway appeared to be IM3 -> (TS4)-T-1 -> (IM4)-I-5 -> (5)TS5 -> (5)IM5 -> (5)pro + T-2. The fourth step of dehydrogenation TNiCT -> T2NiC was the rate-determining step of the entire reaction with the rate constant of k(2) = 2.8 x 10(13) exp(-313,136/RT) (in cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1)), and its activation energy barrier was calculated to be 51.8 kcal/mol. The Ni-catalyzed CH4 and CD4 cracking dehydrogenation processes are also investigated and the hydrogen isotope effect is evaluated. The hydrogen isotope effect value of k(H)/k(T) is computed to be 2.94, and the value of k(D)/k(T) is computed to be 1.39. The catalytic dehydrogenation reactions of methane and deuterated methane are likely to occur, accompanied by the tritiated methane catalytic cracking reaction in the fusion process.

Stochastic and deterministic models to evaluate the critical distance of a near surface repository for the disposal of intermediate and low level radioactive wastes	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								The aim of this paper is to present the stochastic and deterministic models developed for the evaluation of the critical distance of a near surface repository for the disposal of intermediate (ILW) and low level (LLW) radioactive wastes. The critical distance of a repository is defined as the distance between the repository and a well in which the water activity concentration is able to cause a radiological dose to a member of the public equal to the dose limit set by the regulatory body. The mathematical models are developed based on the Richards equation for the liquid flow in the porous media and on the solute transport equation in this medium. The release of radioactive material from the repository to the environment is considered through its base and its flow is determined by Darcy's Law. The deterministic model is obtained from the stochastic approach by neglecting the influence of the Gaussian white noise on the rainfall and the equations are solved analytically with the help of conventional calculus (non-stochastic calculus). The equations of the stochastic model are solved analytically based on the Ito stochastic calculus and numerically by using the Euler-Maruyama method. The impact on the value of the critical distance of the Abadia de Goias repository is analyzed, taken as a study case, when the deterministic methodology is replaced by the stochastic one, considered more appropriate for modeling rainfall as a stochastic process.

Transient stratification modelling of a corium pool in a LWR vessel lower head	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							RETENTION; BEHAVIOR; REACTOR; MELT	In the context of light water reactor severe accidents analysis, this paper is focused on one key parameter of in-vessel corium phenomenology: the immiscible phases stratification and its impact on the heat flux distribution at the corium pool lateral boundary with the so-called focusing effect related to a "thin" top metal phase and the potential vessel failure at that point. More particularly, based on the limited knowledge of the stratification transient phenomenon derived from the MASCA-RCW experiment, a basic model is proposed that can be used for corium in lower head sensitivity analyses. It has been implemented in the PROCOR platform developed at CEA Cadarache. A short parametric study on a simple hypothetical transient is presented in order to highlight the different focusing effect "modes" that can be encountered based on this in-vessel corium pool model. An early mode may occur during the formation of the top metal layer while two other modes may appear later during the thinning of this top metal layer because of thermochemically induced mass transfers. Some associated relevant parameters (model or scenario-dependent) and modelling issues are mentioned and illustrated with some results of a Monte-Carlo based sensitivity calculation on the transient behaviour of the corium in the lower head of a 1650 MWe GenIll PWR. Within the limiting modelling hypotheses, the thermal modelling of the steel layer for small (centimetre) heights and the mass diffusivity (limited in this case to the uranium diffusivity in the oxidic layer) are main sensitive parameters.

J	Li, QM; Tian, P; Zhou, C; Wang, NX				Li, Qiming; Tian, Pan; Zhou, Chong; Wang, Naxiu			A new method to evaluate the sealing reliability of the flanged connections for Molten Salt Reactors	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								The Thorium based Molten Salt Reactor (TMSR) project is a future Generation IV nuclear reactor system proposed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences with the strategic goal of meeting the growing energy needs in the Chinese economic development and social progress. It is based on liquid salts served as both fuel and primary coolant and consequently great challenges are brought into the sealing of the flanged connections. In this study, an improved prototype flange assembly is performed on the strength of the Freeze-Flange initially developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The calculation results of the finite element model established to analyze the temperature profile of the Freeze-Flange agree well with the experimental data, which indicates that the numerical simulation method is credible. For further consideration, the ideal-gas thermodynamic model, together with the mathematical approximation, is novelly borrowed to theoretically evaluate the sealing performance of the modified Freeze-Flange and the traditional double gaskets bolted flange joint. This study focuses on the passive decrease of the leak driving force due to multiple gaskets introduced in flanged connections for MSR. The effects of the redesigned flange configuration on molten salt leakage resistance are discussed in detail. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A transient natural convection model of the accelerator blanket primary heat removal (HR) system was developed to demonstrate that the blanket could be cooled for a sufficient period of time for long-term cooling to be established following a loss-of-flow accident (LOFA). The particular case of interest in this work is a complete LOFA. For the accident scenario in which pumps are lost in both the target and blanket HR systems, natural convection provides effective cooling of the blanket for similar to 68 h, and if only the blanket HR systems are involved, natural convection is effective for similar to 210 h. The heat sink for both of these accident scenarios is the assumed stagnant fluid and metal on the secondary sides of the heat exchangers.	[Lee, Si Y.; Hamm, L.

The comparison of calculated theoretical reaction heat value and practical value is also given. The result shows that with the increase of density of U(VI) and hydrazine, increase of amount of catalyst and decrease of nitric acid, reaction rate slows down. The reaction kinetic rate equation is as follow: -dC(UO22+)/dt =KC1.11(UO22+)C-1.42(N2H5+)C-0.72(H (+)), and the reaction rate constant is 1.3 x 10(-3) (mol/L)(-0.81) / min when r(S/L) is 0.008 kg/L at 50 degrees C. The theoretical reaction equation of unit volume is as follows: Q = a Delta H-f(m,1)Theta + Delta H-f(m,2)Theta [C(N2H4) - C(UO22+)a/2 - beta]/3. The comparison shows the coincidence in 1 h of theoretical value and practical value.

TRISO (TRi-structural-ISO-tropic) particles from the spherical fuel elements contain UO2 fuel kernels (500 mu m diameter) which are coated by three tight layers ensuring the encapsulation of fission products during reactor operation. After cracking of the tight coatings Kr-85 and C-14 as (CO2)-C-14 were detected in the gas fraction. Xe was not detected in the gas fraction, although ESEM (Environmental Scanning Electron Micoscope) investigations revealed an accumulation in the buffer. UO2 fuel kernels were exposed to synthetic groundwater under oxic and anoxic/reducing conditions. U concentration in the leachate was below the detection limit, indicating an extremely low matrix dissolution. Within the leach period of 276 d Sr-90 and Cs-134/137 fractions located at grain boundaries were released and contribution to IRF up to max. 0.2% respectively 8%. Depending on the environmental conditions, different release functions were observed. Second relevant release steps occurred in air after similar to 120 d, indicating the formation of new accessible leaching sites. ESEM investigations were performed to study the impact of leaching on the microstructure. In oxic environment, numerous intragranular open pores acting as new accessible leaching sites were formed and white spherical spots containing Mo and Zr were identified. Under anoxic/reducing conditions numerous metallic precipitates (Mo, Tc and Ru) filling the intragranular pores and white spherical spots containing Mo and Zr, were detected. In conclusion, leaching in different geochemical environments influenced the speciation of radionuclides and in consequence the stability of neoformed phases, which has an impact on IRF.

In the aim of personnel training and experience gathering at the Universidad Simon Bolivar there is in progress a project of developing a subcritical thorium liquid-fuel reactor. The neutron source to run this subcritical reactor is a Cf-252 source and the reactor will use high-purity graphite as moderator. Using the MCNP5 code the neutron spectra of the Cf-252 in the center of the graphite moderator has been estimated along the channel where the liquid thorium salt will be inserted; also the ambient dose equivalent due to the source has been determined around the moderator.

Nucleation and growth of hydrogen bubbles on dislocations in tungsten under high flux low energy plasma exposure	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Hydrogen retention; Tungsten; Bubble	DEUTERIUM RETENTION; SURFACE; DEPENDENCE; DIFFUSION	A new mechanism for the nucleation and growth of hydrogen (H) bubbles on dislocations under plasma exposure of tungsten was recently proposed on the basis of direct ab initio calculations. Density functional theory calculations demonstrated that H atoms are strongly bound to a screw dislocation core and exhibit fast one-dimensional migration along its line. Once the number of hydrogen atoms trapped on a dislocation segment exceeds eight, the emission of a jog occurs thereby converting a pure H-N cluster into a HN+1-jog configuration. On the basis of these results a kinetic model was formulated to evaluate the conditions (i.e., range of temperature and flux exposure) for the transformation of pure H clusters into supercritical hydrogen vacancy clusters attached to the dislocation line. In this work, a parametric study employing the kinetic nucleation model was performed to derive the hydrogen bubble formation energy function that offers the best agreement with available experimental results. The obtained results allow one to rationalize the depth and temperature dependence of the experimentally observed hydrogen deposition after high flux low energy plasma exposure for ITER relevant conditions.

Accelerated chemical aging of crystalline nuclear waste forms: A density functional theory study of (CdxAg1-xS)-Cd-109-Ag-109	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Cadmium sulfide; Silver sulfide; Nuclear waste forms; Transmutation; Density functional theory	RADIATION TOLERANCE; CDS; PLUTONIUM; CERAMICS; WURTZITE; OXIDES; ALPHA	Recently, a combined experimental theoretical approach to assess the effect of daughter product formation on the stability of crystalline compounds comprised of radioisotopes has been developed. This methodology was motivated by the potential impact on crystalline nuclear waste form stability of a significant fraction of the constituent atoms undergoing transmutation. What is particularly novel about this approach is the experimental use of very short-lived isotopes to accelerate the chemical evolution that occurs during decay. In this paper, we present results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations that have been performed in support of corresponding experiments on the (CdxAg1-xS)-Cd-109-Ag-109 material system. Cd-109 has been selected in order to simulate the decay of important "short-lived" fission products Cs-137 or Sr-90 (which decay via beta- to Ba-137 and Zr-90 respectively with approximate to 30-year half-lives). By comparison, Cd-109 decays by electron capture with a half-life of 109 days to Ag-109. DFT results predict the formation of heretofore unobserved CdxAg1-xS structures, which support corresponding experiments and ultimately may have implications for waste form stability.

Molecular dynamics study of the bulk temperature effect on primary radiation damage in uranium dioxide	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Irradiation; Cascade; Uranium dioxide; Molecular dynamics; Temperature	FISSION-GAS BUBBLES; HIGH BURNUP UO2; DISPLACEMENT CASCADES; MICROSTRUCTURAL CHANGE; IRRADIATION; FUELS; NUCLEATION; MECHANISM; RECOVERY; DEFECTS	The effect of bulk temperature on the primary damage induced by a displacement cascade was investigated in uranium dioxide using classical molecular dynamics simulations. In this study, the Morelon potentials were used to model the middle-range interactions between the atoms that constitute the host matrix during the radiation events. Cascades were initiated by accelerating a uranium primary knock-on atom at 10 keV inside a perfect 1302 lattice at a temperature between 700 K and 1800 K, a range which comprises in-pile temperatures of oxide fuels in light water reactors in standard operating conditions. Cascade overlap sequences were also simulated at 700 K and 1400 K in,order to study the radiation damage accumulation in the oxide fuel. This study reveals the maximum damage level which the material can accommodate for decreases with the temperature. Furthermore the direct formation of vacancy clusters under irradiation is considerably slowed down above 1000 K, notably during cascade overlap sequences. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The interatomic potentials of PuN were fitted by using Chen-Mobius multiple lattice inversion technique. Based on these interatomic potentials, the lattice constant, bulk modulus, compressibility, cohesive energy and heat capacity of PuN were obtained and the results are well consistent with experimental data and previous reports.

Measurement of fission gas release from irradiated U-Mo monolithic fuel samples	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							NUCLEAR-FUEL	The uranium-molybdenum (U-Mo) alloy in a monolithic form has been proposed as one fuel design capable of converting some of the world's highest power research reactors from the use of high enriched uranium (HEU) to low enriched uranium (LEU). One aspect of the fuel development and qualification process is to demonstrate appropriate understanding of the extent of fission product release from the fuel under anticipated service environments. An apparatus capable of heating post-irradiated small-scale samples cut from larger fuel segments according to specified thermal profiles under a controlled atmosphere has been installed into a hot cell. Results show that optimized experimental parameters to investigate fission product release from small samples have been established. Initial measurements conducted on aluminum alloy clad uranium-molybdenum monolithic fuel samples reveal three clear fission gas release events over the temperature range of 30-1000 degrees C. The mechanisms responsible for these events are discussed, and the results have been compared with available information in the literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Deuterium migration in nuclear graphite: Consequences for the behavior of tritium in CO2-cooled reactors and for the decontamination of irradiated graphite waste	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							THERMAL-BEHAVIOR; NRA	In this paper, we aim at understanding tritium behavior in the graphite moderator of French CO2-cooled nuclear fission reactors (called UNGG for "Uranium Naturel-Graphite-Gaz") to get information on its distribution and inventory in the irradiated graphite waste after their dismantling. These findings should be useful both to improve waste treatment processes and to foresee tritium behavior during reactor decommissioning and waste disposal operations. The purpose of the present work is to elucidate the effects of temperature on the behavior of tritium during reactor operation. Furthermore, it aims at exploring options of thermal decontamination. For both purposes, annealing experiments were carried out in inert atmosphere as well as in thermal conditions as close as possible to those encountered in UNGG reactors and in view of a potential decontamination in humid gas. D+ ions were implanted into virgin nuclear graphite in order to simulate tritium displaced from its original structural site through recoil during reactor operation. The effect of thermal treatments on the mobility of the implanted deuterium was then investigated at temperatures ranging from 200 to 1200 degrees C, in inert atmosphere (vacuum or argon), in a gas simulating the UNGG coolant gas (mainly CO2) or in humid nitrogen. Deuterium was analyzed by Nuclear Reaction Analysis (NRA) both at millimetric and micrometric scales. We have identified three main stages for the deuterium release. The first one corresponds to deuterium permeation through graphite open pores. The second and third ones are controlled by the progressive detrapping of deuterium located at different trapping sites and its successive migration through the crystallites and along crystallites and coke grains edges. Extrapolating the thermal behavior of deuterium to tritium, the results show that the release becomes significant above the maximum UNGG reactor temperature of 500 degrees C and should be lower than 30% of the total amount produced over a reactor operating time corresponding to about 11 effective full-power years. Moreover, it would mainly concern the tritium located close to the free surfaces. Furthermore, the total extraction of the remaining tritium in graphite waste should be more efficient in dry inert gas than in humid gas, but would require temperatures higher than 1300 degrees C for the total removal of the most deeply located deuterium.

Determination of diffusion coefficients of hydrogen and deuterium in Zr-2.5%Nb pressure tube material using hot vacuum extraction-quadrupole mass spectrometry	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							ZIRCONIUM ALLOYS; TERMINAL SOLUBILITY; ALPHA-PHASE; ZIRCALOY-2; ZR-2.5NB; LIMITS	The diffusion coefficients of hydrogen and deuterium in Zr-2.5%Nb alloy were measured in the temperature range 523 to 673 K, employing hot vacuum extraction-quadrupole mass spectrometry (HVE-QMS). One end of the Zr-2.5%Nb alloy specimens was charged electrolytically with the desired hydrogen isotope. After annealing at different temperatures for a predetermined time, the specimens were cut into thin slices, which were analyzed for their H-2/D-2 content using the HVE-QMS technique. The depth profile data were fitted into the equation representing the solution of Fick's second law of diffusion. The activation energy of hYdrogen/deuterium diffusion was obtained from the Arrhenius relation between the diffusion coefficient and temperature. The temperature dependent diffusion coefficient can be represented as D-H = 1.41 x 10(-7) exp(-36,000/RT) and D-D = 6.16 x 10(-8) exp(-35,262/RT) for hydrogen and deuterium, respectively.
