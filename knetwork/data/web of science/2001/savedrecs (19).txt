The validity of the established analytical potentials is tested by calculating the crystallographic parameters of the compositions for 0 less than or equal to y less than or equal to 6 and comparing to the experimental values. The validity is further tested by calculating the variation of the phonon spectra when transitioning from the fluoroapatite Ca(10)(PO(4))(6)F(2) to the full silicate neodymium fluorobritholite Ca(4)Nd(6)(SiO(4))(6)F(2). Trivalent plutonium ions are introduced into the mono-silicate neodymium fluorobritholite using transferable potentials in order to obtain the composition Ca(9)Pu(0.5)Nd(0.5)(SiO(4))(PO(4))(5)F(2), which corresponds to a Pu concentration of about 10 wt%. The thermodynamic properties of the resulting structure are calculated, and the threshold displacement energies of various sublattices are estimated by applying the sudden approximation (SA) method. The activation energies for Frenkel defect annealing are also calculated using the rational function optimisation (RFO) procedure for the saddle point research. (C) 2001. Elsevier Science B.V.

Chemical durability of these matrices is a major problem. Radiation damages due to a-decay events can strongly reduced it. The defect creation mechanism has been determined in fluoroapatite using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) on line with an ion implanter. At room temperature, the defect creation is controlled by amorphization directly in the cascade. From this result and published data on the defect annealing in this material, the disorder evolution as a function of time has been established. An application concerning the incorporation of Cm-244 is considered. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The results show that the conductivity decreases monotonically with increasing temperature. The observed conductivity can be explained in terms of the phonon-defects and phonon-phonon interaction processes. It is also shown that the intrinsic thermal resistivity can be quantitatively explained by the modified Leibfried-Schlomann (LS) equation proposed by G.A. Slack (in: H. Ehrenreich, F. Seitz, D.

The sintered density of UO2-10 wt% Gd2O3 pellets decreases with increasing oxygen potential of the sintering atmosphere. Dilatometry and X-ray diffraction studies indicate that the delay of densification takes place between 1300 degreesC and 1500 degreesC, along with the formation of (U,Gd) O-2 A very large solubility of Gd2O3 in UOz relative to the reverse solubility might cause Gd ions to diffuse into UO2 so directionally that new pores are produced at the places of Gd2O3 particles. The new pores may be difficult to shrink and thus lead to the density decrease under an oxidizing atmosphere but not under a reducing atmosphere, because a driving force for the shrinkage of new pores may be smaller under an oxidizing atmosphere than under a reducing atmosphere.

J	Chevalier, PY; Fischer, E				Chevalier, PY; Fischer, E			Thermodynamic modelling of the C-U and B-U binary systems	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Review								The thermodynamic modelling of the carbon-uranium (C-U) and boron-uranium (B-U) binary systems is being performed in the framework of the development of a thermodynamic database for nuclear materials, for increasing the basic knowledge of key phenomena which may occur in the event of a severe accident in a nuclear power plant. Applications are foreseen in the nuclear safety held to the physico-chemical interaction modelling, on the one hand the invessel core degradation producing the cerium (fuel, zircaloy, steel, control rods) and on the other hand the ex-vessel molten cerium-concrete interaction (MCCI). The key O-U-Zr ternary system, previously modelled, allows us to describe the first interaction of the fuel with zircaloy cladding. Then, the three binary systems Fe-U, Cr-U and Ni-U were modelled as a preliminary work for modelling the O-U-Zr-Fe-Cr-Ni multicomponent system, allowing us to introduce the steel components in the cerium. In the existing database (TDBCR, thermodynamic data base for cerium), Ag and In were introduced for modelling AIC (silver-indium-cadmium) control rods which are used in French pressurized water reactors (PWR). Elsewhere, B4C is also used for control rods. That is why it was agreed to extend in the next years the database with two new components, B and C. Such a work needs the thermodynamic modelling of all the binary and pseudo-binary sub-systems resulting from the combination of B, B2O3 and C with the major components of TD B CR, O-U-Zr-Fe-Cr-Ni-Ag-In-Ba-La-Ru-Sr-Al-Ca-Mg-Si + Ar-H. The critical assessment of the very numerous experimental information available for the C-U and B-U binary systems was performed by using a classical optimization procedure and the Scientific Group Thermodata Europe (SGTE). New optimized Gibbs energy parameters are given, and comparisons between calculated and experimental equilibrium phase diagrams or thermodynamic properties are presented.

J	Olander, DR; Van Uffelen, P				Olander, DR; Van Uffelen, P			On the role of grain boundary diffusion in fission gas release	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							UO2 FUEL; HIGH-TEMPERATURE; BWR FUELS; PRODUCTS; WATER; IRRADIATION; CODE	It is generally believed that thermal fission gas release from LWR fuel occurs mainly via interconnected grain boundary bubbles. Grain boundary diffusion is not considered to be a significant mechanism. We investigated this supposition by two methods; first, by assessing the distance a gas atom can migrate in a grain boundary containing perfectly absorbing traps. For areal number densities and fractional coverages by the traps observed in fuel irradiated to burnups exceeding similar to 20 MWd/kg, gas atoms will be trapped after a migration distance equal to the size of a grain or less. This supports the supposition for medium-to-high burnups. However, the above-mentioned model is inapplicable for trace-irradiated specimens. In our second analysis, we examined Xe release from trace-irradiated UO2. The measurements indicated that the liberation involves more than only lattice diffusion at the specimen surface, and that the data are consistent with sequential lattice and grain boundary diffusion unimpeded by intergranular traps. The analysis also provided rough estimates of the grain boundary diffusion coefficient in UO2. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Examined were (i) a tokamak fusion test reactor (TFTR) graphite tile (D-D plasmas), (ii) a JET graphite tile (low-tritium D-T plasmas), and (iii) several JET carbon fibre composite (CFC) divertor tiles as well as a graphite limiter tile (all high-tritium D-T plasmas). Whilst the bulk tritium concentration in graphite tiles appears to remain at very low levels (about 0.3% of the total tritium) the tritium bulk concentrations in CFC divertor tiles can be as high as three times that in the surface layer. The latter is attributed to plasma-induced trapping of tritium between the fibre planes of CFC in the hot divertor zone. In addition to carbon/hydrogen co-deposition, this contribution constitutes another important source of tritium inventory in the torus that so far had not been recognised.

J	Furutani, G; Nakajima, N; Konishi, T; Kodama, M				Furutani, G; Nakajima, N; Konishi, T; Kodama, M			Stress corrosion cracking on irradiated 316 stainless steel	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article								Tests on irradiation-assisted stress corrosion cracking (IASCC) were carried out by using cold-worked (CW) 316 stainless steel (SS) in-core flux thimble tubes which were irradiated up to 5 x 10(26) n/m(2) (E > 0.1 MeV) at 310 degreesC in a Japanese PWR. Unirradiated thimble tube was also tested for comparison with irradiated tubes. Mechanical tests such as the tensile, hardness tests and metallographic observations were performed. The susceptibility to SCC was examined by the slow strain rate test (SSRT) under PWR primary water chemistry condition and compositional analysis on the grain boundary segregation was made. Significant changes in the mechanical properties due to irradiation such as a remarkable increase of strength and hardness, and a considerable reduction of elongation were seen. SSRT results revealed that the intergranular fracture ratio (%IGSCC) increased as dissolved hydrogen (DH) increased. In addition, SSRT results in argon gas atmosphere showed a small amount of intergranular cracking. The depletion of Fe, Cr, Mo and the enrichment of Ni and Si were observed in microchemical analyses on the grain boundary. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

For this purpose, experiments were carried out to investigate the reactivity effect of an iron reflector in a light-water-moderated core using the critical assembly, TCA. The experiment showed that iron reflectors of lj cm thickness made the core more reactive than water and that the increasing the thickness from 2.2 cm to 15 cm produced 1.8%n Deltak/k core reactivity gain. The experiment was analyzed with the two-dimensional transport code PHOENIX-P and the continuous energy Monte Carlo code MVP. From the analyses, it has been found that, if the ENDF/B-VI data for iron isotopes are used, the calculated reactivity effect gives good agreement with the experiment and that the epi-thermal and thermal capture reaction rate distributions measured with gold wires and the resultant spectral index distribution are also well reproduced. The experiment and calculations have revealed that increasing a baffle plate thickness in PWRs above 2.2 cm can increase the core reactivity and contribute to fuel cycle cost saving. Based on this result, a stainless steel radial reflector has been employed in the APWR, and it has been shown that a reduction of about 0.07 wt% U-235 enrichment can he achieved with the use of this radial reflector. Lastly, through the experimental analyses, the reactivity effect of the iron reflector has been found to give a benchmark useful for the evaluation of iron nuclear data. We expect that the experimental data described in this paper will be used to verify new iron data.

In order to clarify the condition for liquefaction at the fuel-cladding interface, the reactions of U-Pu alloys with Fe have been examined at 923 and 943 K. The test results confirmed that the liquid phase is not formed at 923 K in any region of the reaction zone when the maximum Pu content in the (U,Pu)(6)Fe phase is less than the Pu solubility limit in this phase. Comparison of the present test results with the liquefaction data from the various tests on metallic fuel-cladding compatibility suggested that the liquefaction condition is independent of the Zr content in the fuel alloy and can be expressed as a function of the atom fraction ratio of Pu/(U+Pu) in the fuel alloy and the reaction temperature. At 923 K, liquefaction will occur when the Pu/(U+Pu) ratio is larger than 0.25.

J	Matsuo, T; Nishi, T				Matsuo, T; Nishi, T			Treatment rate improvement of the ozone oxidation method for laundry waste water	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						treatment rate; ozone; laundry waste water; nuclear power plants; heating; flow rates; TOC		Radioactive laundry waste water generated in nuclear power plants includes organic compounds to be removed, for which ozone oxidation treatment is a possibility. To verify the applicability, its total organic carbon concentration (TOC) lowering rate improvement was examined in 0.5 x 10(-3) m(3) batch and 3x10(-2) m(3) pilot equipment experiments. In the batch experiments, ozone at a concentration of 200 g/Nm(3) was dispersed into 0.5 x 10(-3) m(3) of Simulated Laundry Waste Water (SLWW) with TOC of 11 mM. Total organic carbon concentration was measured every hour to see the effects of the temperature, and the initial concentrations of both H2O2 and NaOH which were added to urge OH radical generation from ozone. In the pilot equipment experiments, 1 x 10(-2) to 3 x 10(-2) m(3) of the SLWW were circulated using an ejector to disperse the ozone. The influences of the flow rate and the SLWW volume on lowering TOC were examined, because they were related to the ejector dispersion performance and the appropriate ozone addition per SLWW volume. Appropriate initial H2O2 and NaOH concentrations in the batch experiments were 14.7 mM and 1 mM, respectively. Lowering of TOC became faster at higher temperatures, because ozone self-decomposition and OH radical diffusion to the organic compound molecules were promoted. Lowering of TOC also became faster at higher flow rates, while the influence of the volume became saturated.

A ROX fueled LWR core has reactivity coefficients and burnup reactivity swing problems, which can be mitigated by these additives. From the burnup calculations of the ROX fueled LWR. it was found that the additive ThO2 causes a few percent decrease in Pu transmutation in ROX fuel, while the additive UO2 or Er2O3 decreases it largely The production of Am-241, which is a parent of long-lived Np-237, is smaller in ThO2 added fuel than that in UO2 or Er2O3 added fuel. However, the productions of Am-243 and Cm-244 are more in ThO2 added fuel than those in UO2 or (ErO3)-O-2 added fuel. The long-lived fission products (LLFPs) production in ThO2 added fuel is nearly the same as that in UO2 added fuel, and smaller than that in Er2O3 added fuel. As a result of these Pu transmutation and minor actinides (MAs) and LLFPs productions, ingestion radiotoxicity hazard index of ThO2 added ROX spent fuel is lower than that of UO2 or Er2O3 added ROX spent fuel, except at the 10(5) years cooling. From these calculations, ThO2 is recommended to be used as the additive in ROX fuel.

As a result, substantial number of nuclear submarines equipped with ballistic missiles will be also withdrawn from service. However. Russian nuclear submarines have suffered from reactivity accidents five times. In the paper, a reactivity accident on a nuclear submarine that happened at Chazhma Bay located between Vladivostok and Nakhodka on August 10, 1985, has been described. In addition, the characteristics of submarine nuclear reactors, procedures of refueling, and the possibility of a similar accident are given. Further, the radiological risk to Japan and neighboring countries has been assessed by using an atmospheric pollutant transport code, WSPEEDI, developed by Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute. The radiological risk has been evaluated for the Chazhma Bay accident and for a hypothetical reactivity accident of a retired submarine during defueling, assuming winter meteorological conditions. The analyses have shown that the radioactive material might be transported in the atmosphere to Japan in one to several days and might contaminate wide areas of Japan. Under the assumptions taken in the paper, however, the radiological dose to population in the area might be not significant.

This Lime dependent emission results in variation of the U-concentration in the released aerosol. The subsequent annealing ("maturation") reactions acting on the aerosol particles are greatly affected bq the emission sequence of the different elements.

Slovenia. indoor radon and gamma dose rate measurements were carried out in nineteen schools from February 10 to May 10. 1995. using scintillation cells and etched track detectors for radon rind thermoluminescence dosimeters for gamma-ray. detection. In five schools indoor radon levels exceeded 400 Bq.m(-3). which is the proposed Slovene action level. The maximum average radon value of 1600 Bq mj and the maximum gamma-dose rate of 172 mu Sv month(-1) were found in the same school. According to the ICRP 65 methodology. annual effective doses from radon decay products ranged from 0.05 to 6.10 mSv for pupils and from 0.04 to 4.90 mSv for teachers. Gamma dose rates ranged from 0.05 to 0.19 mSv.y(-1) for pupils and from 0.07 to 0.27 mSv.y(-1) for teachers.

The uranium(IV) coordination at the trilacunary Keggin units shifts the nu (as)(W-O-b,O-c-W), nu (as)(W=O-d), nu (as)(W-O-a) antisymmetric stretching vibration bands in the 700 divided by 950 cm(-1) region of the FT-IR spectrum of U(IV)-complex. The visible electronic absorption spectrum of the complex indicates a H-3(4) electronic ground state of uranium ions and a quasicubic local symmetry around them. The UV electronic spectra of the U(IV)-POM complex and of the ligand present the broad bands assigned to p(pi)-d(pi) electronic transitions in the W=O bonds (at 46640 cm(-1) for the ligand and 47280 cm(-1) for the complex) and d(x)-p(pi)-d(pi) transitions in tricentric W-O-W bonds (at 40880 cm(-1) for the ligand and 39920 cm(-1) for the complex).

Nd. Th and U (concentration 10 to 1000 mg l(-1)) was studied using instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and C-12-Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (C-12-RBS). For comparison, the sorption of La and Nd by granitic feldspar and natural zeolite heulandite was also investigated. The experimental results showed that biotite exhibits higher sorption ability towards La and Nd, (maximum uptake 2.09 and 7.98 mg/g, respectively) than the feldspar and the heulandite. The interaction of biotite with Th is also intense. the metal being preferably concentrated at the near-surface layers of the crystals. This indicates that other sorption mechanisms (adsorption and surface precipitation) than ion-exchange take place at the solid/solution interface. The same phenomenon was also observed in the case of U, although the corresponding metal uptake was found to be: considerably lower.

In addition to concentration data. strontium isotopic composition of the soil samples were measured by thermal ionization mass spectrometry. The measurements contributed to the understanding of the background levels of these elements in an area contaminated due to Chernobyl accident. There was not a significant variation in the concentration of REEs at different depth levels in forest soil samples, however, the ratio of Th/U varied from 3.32 to 3.60. Though concentration of U and Th varied to some extent, the ratio did not show much variation. The value of Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio, was in the top layer soil sample relatively higher than in the lower layers.

The growth suppression by selenium in the medium was observed in most of the microorganisms tested. The amounts of selenium taken up in microbial cells differ with different species and groups of microorganisms. The marked enhancement of uranium adsorbing ability by Se-loading was only found in yeasts, such as Candida utilis. The amounts of uranium adsorbed by the cells were increased with increasing selenium in the cells. Thus, it is assumed that the selenium in the cells will play an important role in uranium binding.

Na, Mg, Cl, K, Mn, Zn, Rb and Br were determined in young and aged mice. by instrumental neutron activation analysis for small amounts of regional (corpus striatum, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, midbrain, pens and medulla olfactory bulb) samples. Significant age-related differences were found for Mn concentration in all brain regions. The Mn concentration of the young brain was higher than those of aged brain, in addition, Zn was distributed heterogeneously, and highly concentrated in cerebral cones and hippocampus regions in both young and aged mice. These results suggest that, in the aged brain, Mn is required less than in the young brain, on the other hand, Zn is required equally in both young and aged brains.

Since the diketonate complexes are volatile. we developed a new solid-liquid extraction system based on the adsorption of neutral complexes on hydrophobized glass surfaces. This system was applied to the studies of complexation of the short-lived isotopes Zr4+, Hf4+, Po4+, and Rf(4+). The procedure including collection of radioactivity, adsorption of complexes and preparation of the alpha -source, took roughly 50-60 seconds to complete. The obtained results show that studies of adsorption on hydrophobized glass surface mag provide important experimental data on the formation of chelate complexes with short-lived radionuclides.

H-3 was used for obtaining the migration velocity. of the moisture water in the test zone. The result of the 2-year test indicated that under natural rainfall conditions, the migration of Sr-85 is a combination of downward and upward movements. It moves down in summer and moves up in winter. Under artificial rainfall conditions the migration of Sr-85 is a velocity-change process. It migrates down faster in summer and slower in winter. This phenomenon is considered to be caused by the dry winter and relatively wet summer.

Specific activities ranging from 3.6 to 45.2 mBq/l have been detected, in general, activity levels are lower than those detected when direct discharges were carried out. However, there is still a clear contamination due to the disposal of phosphogypsum in open air piles by the river.

J	Balkey, JJ; Wieneke, RE				Balkey, JJ; Wieneke, RE			Transuranic waste management at Los Alamos National Laboratory	NUCLEAR ENERGY-JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH NUCLEAR ENERGY SOCIETY			English	Article						transuramic; plutonium; minimisation; computerised		Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) was, the first to ship transuranic waste for deep geologic disposal in the waste isolation pilot plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, New Mexico. This was the culmination of a tremendous effort on the part of personnel at the Plutonium Facility (TA-55) where the waste was generated and of LANL waste management personnel. The Plutonium Facility provides a wide variety of actinide research and development capabilities in support of national defence needs. Many of these operations produce a wide variety of waste forms, including transuranic waste from activities in the glove-box lines throughout the facility. Critical to the success of this shipment was the integrity of the waste management programme at TA-55. A group of dedicated waste management professionals worked intimately with actinide processing operations personnel to assure that all waste packages met the WIPP waste acceptance criteria and were documented and packaged in accordance with all applicable regulations. Records are largely computerised, eliminating paper forms and improving the integrity of data packages and expediting the review and approval process. Research into waste minimisation has succeeded in identifying processes to reduce the volumes of transuranic waste produced and has resulted in the implementation of decontamination and waste avoidance techniques in the facility. This paper provides a broad overview of current waste management activivities in the TA-55 Plutonium Facility.

The question now is: 'How does the nuclear industry engineer a suitable storage regime for the foreseeable future?'. This paper explores some of the engineering considerations that Nuclear Installations Inspectorate specialist inspectors need to address when considering the safety case for a long-term radioactive materials store. Any licensee contemplating building a store should already know of such items. Integrity of waste form, storage container, handling equipment and store structure are addressed.

J	Sepold, L				Sepold, L			Reflooding experiments with LWR-type fuel rod simulators in the QUENCH facility	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Meeting on Nuclear Ractor Thermal Hydraulics (NURETH-9)	OCT 03-08, 1999	SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA					The QUENCH experiments at the Karlsruhe Research Center are carried out to investigate the hydrogen generated during reflooding of an uncovered Light Water Reactor (LWR) core. The QUENCH test bundle is made up of 21 fuel rod simulators approximately 2.5 m long. The Zircaloy-4 rod cladding is identical to that used in PWRs (Pressurized Water Reactors) with respect to material and dimensions. Pellets are made of zirconia to simulate UO2. After a transient phase with a heating rate of 0.5-1 K s(-1) water of approx. 395 K is admitted from the bottom when the test bundle has reached its pre-determined temperature. Except for the flooding (quenching) phase, the QUENCH test phases are conducted in an argon/steam atmosphere at 3 g s(-1) each. The results of the first two experiments, QUENCH-O1 (with pre-oxidation of 300 mum oxide layer thickness at the cladding outside surface) and QUENCH-02 (reference test without pre-oxidation), are compared in the paper. The pre-oxidized LWR fuel rod simulators of QUENCH-O1 were quenched from a maximum temperature of similar to 1870 K. In the second bundle experiment, QUENCH-02, quenching started at similar to 2500 K. Pre-oxidation apparently prevented a temperature escalation in the QUENCH-01 test bundle, while the QUENCH-02 test bundle experienced a temperature excursion which started in the transient phase and lasted throughout the flooding phase. The different behavior of the two experiments is also reflected in hydrogen generation. While the bulk of H-2 was produced during pre-oxidation of test QUENCH-01 (30 g), the largest amount, i.e. 170 g, of hydrogen was generated during the reflooding phase of test QUENCH-02, at a maximum production rate of 2.5 g s(-1) as compared to 0.08 g s(-1) in test QUENCH-01. Similarities between the two experiments exist in the thermo-hydraulics during the quench phase, e.g. in the cooling behavior, the quench temperatures, and quench velocities.

The tests, referenced as L-29 and L-31, involved 39 and 92 kg of 80 wt% UO2 + 20 wt% ZrO2 melt, respectively. The molten material was poured into a 1.5-m depth pool of water at 0.2 MPa and ambient temperature. No spontaneous steam explosion occurred. The quenching process was different between the two tests, producing a conglomerate debris bed in L-29 and a particulate debris bed in L-31, with higher thermal load in L-29 than in L-31. The difference in the melt initial temperature is believed to be the cause of this dissimilarity. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

During the crystallization process it is possible to estimate the viscosity of the liquid phase by considering the evolution of its composition during the solid phase deposit. To estimate the increase of viscosity expected with the solid volume fraction and the mean 'dimension' of the solid particles must be known. The first part of this work consists of the application of Urbain's correlation developed for ternary SiO2-Al2O3-CaO mixtures. We calculated the viscosity of basalts and basalt with 18%wt. of UO2, and then, pending direct measurements of liquid cerium viscosity, we tried to determine the range of applicability of this method to cerium-concrete mixtures. In the second part, we looked for an apparent viscosity model which takes account of the increase of solid volume fraction when the temperature of the melt decreases. We observed that the viscosity of metallic or oxidic melts in the solidification range can be expressed as an exponential law versus the solid volume fraction. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In some particular cases the affinity of the tracer is sufficient to consider the use of an intraoperative probe which enables the surgeon to identify radioactive tissues. A radiopharmaceutical consists of a radioisotope bound to a carrier molecule. The radioactive emissions must represent certain criteria in terms of half-life and energy to be detected during an operation. In the field of intraoperative detection radionuclides like Tc-99m, In-111,I-125 and I-131 fall into this category. Their energy, which ranges from some 10 to 364keV, cannot be properly detected by a single type of detector. Two technologies have been developed to yield detectors which are handy and sufficiently sensitive: semiconductor CdTe or CdZnTe to detect low energies and scintillator CsI(TI) for higher energies. Today the intraoperative detection has been evaluated in the case of several pathologies such as osteoid osteoma, colorectal cancer, neuroblastoma, reoperation of differentiated thyroid carcinoma and localization of sentinel node in breast cancer and cutaneous melanoma. Obviously, the results obtained are not comparable from one indication to the other. Nevertheless, the surgeons have noted a considerable advantage in using the intraoperative probe in the case of neuroblastoma and thyroid surgery, especially when the reoperation is difficult or the localizations are ectopic or unusual. As regards the sentinel node, this concept represents a major new opportunity in the field of intraoperative detection and the results actually reported in the literature demonstrate that, when it is detected, elective node excision renders the staging of the disease more accurate. In conclusion, intraoperative detection supplies the surgeon with additional knowledge to be used in correlation with the patient's medical history. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Such measurements are required to verify the operator declarations on irradiated items in a reactor, cooling pond or in a hot cell. Gamma spectra of irradiated nuclear material and non-irradiated nuclear material are measured with miniature CdZnTe detectors and evaluated using specialized software. It is concluded that small-sized CdZnTe detectors are the best choice for characterizing high-level waste, items in hotcells, irradiated fuel assemblies and irradiated non-fuel items. These small detectors can easily be shielded, collimated and brought close to the item to be verified, often allowing in situ measurements. Their resolution is sufficient to resolve the fission product gamma lines of spectra taken from irradiated fuel assemblies with a cooling time of just a few days. Various safeguards applications are described, gamma spectra are shown and the information derived from these measurements is discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The energy resolution of these detectors is lower than for a typical germanium detector but significantly better than for a sodium iodide detector. An incomplete charge collection leads to spectral distortion manifested by asymmetric full-energy peaks and long low-energy tails. The interpretation of the spectra obtained with a CdTe or a CdZnTe detector requires correspondingly accurate knowledge of the analytical line shape. In the present work, the spectral response of a hemispherical CZT (10 x 10 x 5 mm(3)) detector is described with a set of functions (GPP code, J. L. Campbell). The fit parameters have been determined with standard gamma sources thus covering the energy range 121-1332 keV. Point sources in different experimental conditions (background, shielding) have been used to simulate spent fuel spectra. Applying the fixed fit parameters, the ratio Cs-134/Cs-137 has been determined with a good precision. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The better the resolution the easier this task can be accomplished. High-purity germanium detectors (HPGe) are in this respect the best choice, however, they are difficult to use under field conditions and in spent fuel ponds, since they require liquid nitrogen for cooling. NaI detectors do not require cooling, but have limitations in their resolution. For field applications, e.g., the verification of nuclear material, the use of CdZnTe detectors has advantages over NaI detectors since their resolution is much better. CdZnTe detectors, often exhibit asymmetric peak shapes, particularly at high energies making automated peak fitting methods and sophisticated isotope identification programs difficult to use. In this paper the design and use of a semi-automated isotope identification program is described. It is based on an interactive graphical method to find a simple solution to identifying various isotopes which may be present in a sample. The spectrum to be analyzed and an isotopic library containing a list of suspected isotopes is loaded. After selection of detector type,measurement geometry and starting values for the resolution, a peak search is performed. This can also determine the FWHM of the gamma peaks as function of energy. For each gamma peak found, the software suggests possible candidate isotopes to which the gamma peak may belong. The next, most decisive step to determine to which of the sometimes many choices of isotopes, a certain gamma line belongs to, is visual and interactive. Once one candidate's gamma line is marked, the program overlays the expected gamma peak pattern of this isotope with the measured one. Based on the presence or absence of certain lines in the spectrum (checked visually, aided by a numeric indicator), and the observed pattern of coincidence, the user can easily make a decision on whether a certain isotope is present in the sample or not. This approach proved to be simple, effective not requiring specialized knowledge in gamma spectrometry. Although the software works also for low-resolution NaI and high-resolution HPGe detectors, it is in particular well suited for use with spectra of CdZnTe detectors for which peak fit methods are more difficult to use. The deficiency of not using a strict peak fit is compensated by fast and straightforward human interaction. Application examples are given to identify isotopes in various samples, typical for qualitative safeguards verification tasks - attribute tests. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The PCC consists of a matrix of 64 x 64 square pixels with 170 mum side length, each pixel comprising a 15-bit counter and a pulse-height discriminator. The chip has been bump bonded to equally segmented 200 mum thick SI-LEC GaAs detectors showing a very high absorption energy for X-rays used in diagnostics. An absolute calibration of the system with a radioactive source and a synchrotron beam are described resulting in the value of the test input capacitance of similar to 24.7 fF. Using this value a full characterisation of the system from electrical measurements is presented. The entire system can reach a minimum threshold of similar to 2100e(-) with similar to 250e(-) rms noise. One of the characteristic features of the PCC is the possibility to adjust the thresholds of all pixels on a pixel-by-pixel basis with 3-bit precision. The threshold distribution after adjustment is similar to 120e(-) rms. The spatial resolution of the system has been measured to be 3.61p/mm. A comparison of a tooth image taken with the PCC and with a screen-CCD-system demonstrates its imaging capabilities. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Ni and Al at a Ni3Al-5 at.% Mg grain boundary. and the Mg-induced distortion energies at the grain boundary, the bulk and the free surface. The calculated concentration distributions show that Mg segregation is present with Al-depletion and Ni-enrichment at the grain boundary. The cause might be not only that at the same zone, the Mg-induced distortion energy in the site of Al is always negative and lower than that of Ni. but also that the Mg-induced distortion energy in the Al site at the grain boundary is the lowest among those at all zones.

J	Wisshak, K; Voss, F; Kappeler, F				Wisshak, K; Voss, F; Kappeler, F			Neutron capture cross section of Th-232	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							BARIUM FLUORIDE DETECTOR; S-PROCESS; ISOTOPES	The neutron capture cross section of Th-232 has been measured in the energy range from 5 to 225 keV at the Karlsruhe 3.7-MV Van de Graaff accelerator relative to the gold standard. Neutrons were produced via the Li-7(p,n)Be-7 reaction by bombarding metallic Li targets with a pulsed proton beam, and capture events were registered with the Karlsruhe 4 pi barium fluoride detector The main difficulty in this experiment is the detection of true capture events characterized by a comparably low binding energy of 4.78 MeV in the presence of the high-energy gamma background (up to 3.96 MeV) associated with the decay chain of the natural thorium sample. With the high efficiency and the good energy resolution of the 4 rr detector, the sum energy peak of the capture cascades could be reliably separated from the background over the full range of the neutron spectrum, yielding cross-section uncertainties of similar to2% above 20 keV and of 4% at 5 keV. The clear identification of the various background components represents a significant improvement compared to existing data for which sometimes high accuracy was claimed, but which were found to be severely discrepant. A comparison to the evaluated files shows reasonable agreement in the energy range above 15 keV, but also severe discrepancies of up to 40% at lower neutron energies.

A granular hexacyanoferrate ion exchanger has been used in packed-bed column mode operations for the removal of cesium from a variety of wastewater types. CsTreat beds have successfully purified both high-salt evaporator concentrates and dilute floor drain waters at NPPs in Finland and the United Stares. Furthermore, medium-active reprocessing solutions, containing high concentrations of sodium nitrate, have been decontaminated by a CsTreat bed at the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute. These solutions are described as are other industrial applications of this ion exchange material, which, of all the commercial materials, has been shown to be the most selective exchanger for cesium. In addition, some prospective fields of hexacyanoferrate utilization, such as the use of CsTreat powder in a precoat filtration system, are discussed.

J	Lemehov, S; Nakamura, J; Suzuki, M				Lemehov, S; Nakamura, J; Suzuki, M			Pluton: A three-group model for the radial distribution of plutonium, burnup, and power profiles in highly irradiated LWR fuel rods	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							TRANSURANUS	A three-group model (PLUTON) is described, which predicts the power density distribution, plutonium buildup. and burnup profiles across the fuel pellet radius as a function of in-pile rime and parameters characterizing the type of reactor system with respect to fuel temperature and changes of density during the irradiation period The PLUTON model is a part of two fuel performance codes (ASFAD and FEMAXI-V), which provide all necessary input for this model, mainly local temperatures and fuel matrix density across the radius. Comparisons between measurements and predictions of the PLUTON model are made on fuels with enrichments in the range 2.9 to 8.25% and with burnup between 21 000 and 64 000 MWd/t. It is shown that the PLUTON predictions are in good agreement with measurements as well as with predictions of the well-known TUBRNP model. The proposed model is flexibly applicable for all types of light,vater reactor (LWR) fuels, including mired oxide, and for fuel tested in the Organization for Economic Corporation and Development's Halden heavy water reactor. The PLUTON three-group model is based on analytical (theoretical) consideration of neutron absorption in a resonant region of the fuel in its apparent form. It makes the model more flexible in comparison with the semi-empirical TUBRNP one-group model and allows the physically based model analysis of commercial LWR-type fuels at high burnup as well as analysis of experimental fuel rods tested in the Halden heavy water reactor, which is one of the main test reactors in the world. The differences in fuel behavior in the Halden reactor in terms of burnup distribution and plutonium buildup can be more clearly understood with the PLUTON model.

J	Hagrman, DL; Rempe, JL				Hagrman, DL; Rempe, JL			Corium oxidation at temperatures above 2000 K	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								A mechanistic model, based on a quasi-equilibrium analysis of oxidation reactions, is proposed for predicting high-temperature cerium oxidation, The analysis suggests that oxide forming on the surface of corium containing uranium, zirconium, and iron is similar to the oxides formed on zirconium and uranium as long as there is a small percentage of unoxidized zirconium or uranium in the metallic phase. This is because of the higher affinity of zirconium and uranium for oxygen. Hence, oxidation rates and heat production rates are similar to (U,Zr) compounds until nearly all the uranium and zirconium in the cerium oxidizes. Oxidation rates after this point are predicted to be similar to those implied by the oxide thickness present when the forming oxide ceases To be protective, and heat generation rates should be similar to those implied by iron oxidation, i.e., similar to4% of the zirconium oxidation heating rate. The maximum atomic ratio of unoxidized iron to unoxidized liquid zirconium plus uranium for the formation of a solid protective oxide below 2800 K is estimated for a temperature, T(in Kelvin), as follows: unoxidized iron / unoxidized zirconium + uranium = 1/28 root 54.7/exp-(147 061 + 12.08T log(T) - 61.03T - 0.000555T(2) / 1.986T) As long as this limit is not exceeded, either zirconium or uranium metal oxidation rates and heating describe the cerium oxidation rate. If this limit is exceeded, diffusion of steam to the cerium surface will limit the oxidation rate, and linear time-dependent growth of a nonprotective, mostly FeO, layer will occur below the protective (Zr, U) O-2 scale, When this happens, the oxidation should be at the constant rate given by the thickness of the protective layer. Heat generation should be similar to that of iron oxidation.	Idaho Natl Engn & Environm Lab, Idaho Falls, ID 83415 USA	Hagrman, DL (reprint author), 1895 Carmel Dr, Idaho Falls, ID 83402 USA.

Transmutation is proposed to be performed in the blanket of a fusion neutron source with the plasma performance characteristics inherent in the current re search on fusion reactors. The domain of Cs transmutation is quantitatively determined with detailed neutronics analysis of hard and softened neutron spectra, the effect of first wall loading, and two reprocessing modes. One is continuous on-line reprocessing; another one deals with a multicycle option in which a substantially long irradiation period is assumed before reprocessing. Transmutation efficiency is estimated in terms of the effective lifetime of Cs-135, which is the key characteristic governing the approach To equilibrium and the fraction of power associated with cesium transmutation in a nuclear energy system as a whole. In a contrast to fast reactors and accelerator-driven systems, fusion-driven transmutation reveals time to approach equilibrium that is comparable with the lifetime of transmuter and power associated with transmutation lies well within 5% of the total power of the nuclear energy system composed of fission reactors and transmuters.

J	Tedder, DW; Finney, BC				Tedder, DW; Finney, BC			Concepts in waste management: Cerium-promoted dissolution of refractory actinide oxides	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							ELECTROCHEMICAL TREATMENT; HAZARDOUS WASTES; ETHYLENE-GLYCOL; OXIDATION	The effective dissolution of refractory plutonium oxide (fired to T greater than or equal to 1000 degreesC) can be carried out by forming eerie nitrate in nitric acid. Preliminary engineering concepts are presented for dissolving such actinide species in the presence of contaminated high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and incinerator ashes to permit actinide recovery using conventional wet methods. An electrochemical oxidation tank is envisioned with electrodes mounted on the tank lid to facilitate remote operation and maintenance. Contaminated HEPA filters can be treated using an upflow reactor in which eerie nitrate is recirculated between an oxidation tank and a reactor. A membrane separating the electrodes is not required, but special materials of construction are required for all equipment in direct contact with eerie nitrate (e.g., titanium or glass-lined vessels). Since this oxidant is easily reduced to cerous nitrate using oxalic acid, subsequent actinide recovery can be curried out in conventional stainless steel equipment after reduction. The concepts described have been demonstrated on the bench scale.
