J	El Nabi, SHA				El Nabi, SHA			Evaluation of airborne gamma-ray spectrometric data for the Missikat uranium deposit, Eastern Desert, Egypt	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article								The examination of gamma-ray spectrometric data of the Missikat area was found to be useful in locating areas worth exploring for uranium occurrence. The statistical treatment of these data shows that the uranium threshold level is 13 ppm. Such a value represents indirectly the presence of uranium mineralization and identifies anomalous areas on the eU contour map in the northern border of the Missikat-Ria EI Gerra granitic plutons. This area should be of prime concern in uranium exploration of these plutons. The interpretation of the variation in the eU/eTh ratio with eU and eTh suggests that uranium redistribution has occurred within the Missikat-Ria El Gerra granitic plutons. Uranium may be reconcentrated in silicification, sericitization and kaolinization alterations which are geologically evident. eU, eTh and their ratio eU/eTh for the Missikat-Ria El Gerra granites exhibit a lognormal distribution which is in agreement with the general distribution of trace elements, whereas the K content tends towards a normal distribution.

This analysis yields two groups of mineral deposit with different origins. The method deviates from standard methods of following dispersal of radionuclides in the environment, which an usually based on the construction of lines of equal concentrations. The paper focuses on the methodology of quantitatively correlating activity concentrations of natural radionuclides in two groups of minerals. The methodology is widely applicable, but is demonstrated for natural radioactivity in beach sands along the coast of South West Australia. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The techniques used in this research are natural gamma -ray well logging, gamma and alpha-spectrometry. It is shown that uranium concentrations in the samples taken from the wells studied vary between 42.8 and 112.5 ppm with a standard deviation of 15.2 ppm. The P2O5 content varies between 20.5% and 28.31% with a standard deviation of 3.11% and the radioactive intensities vary between 150 and 275 counts per second (cps) with a standard deviation of 31 cps. The ratio of U-224/U-238 in the analyzed samples indicates that the study region is in radioactive equilibrium. The affinity of uranium and P2O5 to some trace elements, such as V, Sr, Cu and Ni has been verified through studying the correlation matrix of these elements. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Geologists, mineralogists, and geophysicists from the division have worked in Ukraine, in Northern and Eastern Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kirgizia and in many regions of the Russian Federation. A great deal of research was performed in the countries of Central Europe, and Mongolia; and recently in certain countries of Asia and Africa. The new scientific information obtained by the division staff has made a large contribution to the study of ore deposits. Books and articles, which played a large role in the founding of a new scientific discipline uranium geology; were published on the basis of this material. Geological and mineralogical schools for studying objects of radioactive raw material have been created and a large number of specialists have been trained in the division.									0	0	0	0	1	CONSULTANTS BUREAU	NEW YORK	233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA	1063-4258			ATOM ENERGY+	Atom.

J	Maichel, G				Maichel, G			The future of nuclear power	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								The market and competition, political boundary conditions, ecological boundary conditions, science and technology as well as international aspects are factors decisive in the future use of nuclear power. The agreement reached between the federal government and the power utilities in June 2000 represents a workable compromise without winners or losers - in a situation in which action was urgently required. Oner: the agreement has: been put into effect by legislators and the executive, operation of the nuclear power plants still on stream can be continued on a long term basis under safe boundary conditions. This requires an amendment to the Atomic Energy Act reflecting the sense of the agreement reached, the constructive inclusion of the federal states, and the immediate, legally assured execution of necessary transports of spent fuel and the construction of on-site stores for spent fuel. In the common interest, the question of final storage should not suffer from politically motivated delays. Factors favoring the further use of nuclear power continue to be mainly ecological and economic ones. The economic performance of plants is being documented very clearly, especially in the course of the deregulation of the electricity market, and the objective of finding a power supply system which protects the climate seems to be attainable only by nuclear power also in countries other than Germany. In the course of globalization, and in the light of thoughts about building new nuclear power plants also in European countries, it must also be in the public interest to preserve competence in nuclear technology, together with a capable infrastructure, in Germany. In addition, strengthening research and development is important in se curing the future technical performance capability of Germany.

J	Konig, W				Konig, W			Licensing procedure for interim stores in Germany	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								The coalition agreement of October 1998 signed by the parties in government contains a provision about the treatment of spent fuel elements from nuclear power plants which, in principle, seeks to avoid transports and terminate reprocessing, which would also end transports to France and the UK, by July 1, 2005, After that date, all fuel elements arising are to be managed by direct disposal. Pending the start of operation of a suitable repository, this concept requires safekeeping of spent fuel elements in appropriate storage facilities. The consensus agreement between the federal government and the power utilities contains this approach with the goal of building on-site storage facilities. The Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS), as the competent supervisory authority under Sec. 6 of the Atomic Energy Act, has received licensing applications for temporary and on-site stores, respectively, as decentralized interim stores for all nuclear power plant sites in Germany (with the exception of Mulheim-Karlich. for which special regulations exist). Three technical concepts, namely two variants of a hall structure, a tunnel concept for Neckarwestheim, and a temporary store, must be examined by BfS in a licensing procedure including as its main steps public participation, examination of the preconditions for a permit, and drafting of the licensing decision. In addition, on-site stores require that an environmental impact assessment be carried out. Proceedings are conducted at BR largely in parallel and speedily by a project group set up. BfS intends to finish all steps involving public participation still this year. When all preconditions have been met for licensing decisions to be granted, and with an assumed construction period of two years, on-site interim stores ought to be available from 2005 on.

J	Barleon, L; Burr, U; Mack, KJ; Stieglitz, R				Barleon, L; Burr, U; Mack, KJ; Stieglitz, R			Magnetohydrodynamic heat transfer research related to the design of fusion blankets	FUSION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							LIQUID-METAL BLANKETS; MHD-FLOW; RECTANGULAR DUCTS; INSULATING WALLS; CONDUCTING WALLS; MAGNETIC-FIELD; INSTABILITIES; TURBULENCE; REACTORS; LAMINAR	Lithium or any lithium alloy like the lithium lead alloy Pb-17Li is an attractive breeder material used in blankets of fusion power reactors because it allows the breeding of tritium and, in the case of self-cooled blankets, the transfer of the heat generated within the liquid metal and the walls of the cooling ducts to an external heat exchanger. Nevertheless, this type of liquid-metal-cooled blanket, called a self-cooled blanket, requires specific design of the coolant ducts, because the interaction of the circulating fluid and the plasma-confining magnetic fields causes magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects, yielding completely different flow patterns compared to ordinary hydrodynamics (OHD) and pressure drops significantly higher than there. In contrast to OHD, MHD flows depend strongly ora the electrical properties of thf wall. Also, MHD flows reveal anisotropic turbulence behavior and are quite sensitive to obstacles exposed to the fluid flow. A comprehensive study of the heat transfer characteristics of free and forced convective MHD flows at fusion-relevant conditions is conducted. The general ideas of the analytical and numerical models to describe MHD heat transfer phenomenon in this parameter regime are discussed. The MHD laboratory being installed, the experimental program established, and the experiments on heat transfer of free and forced convective flow being conducted are described. The theoretical results are compared to the results of a series of experiments in forced and free convective MHD flows with different wall properties, such as electrically insulating as well as electric conducting ducts. Based on this knowledge, methods to improve the heat transfer by means of electromagnetic/mechanic turbulence promoters (TPs) or sophisticated, arranged electrically conducting walls are discussed, experimental results are shown, and a cost-benefit analysis related to these methods is performed. Nevertheless, a few experimental results obtained should be highlighted: 1. The heat flux removable in rectangular electrically conducting ducts at walls parallel to the magnetic field is by a factor of 2 higher than irt the slug flow model previously used in design calculations. Conditions for which this heat transfer enhancement is attainable are presented The measured dimensionless pressure gradient coincides with the theoretical one and is constant throughout the whole Reynolds number regime investigated (Re = 10(3) --> 10(5)), although the flow turns from laminar to turbulent. The use of electromagnetic TPs close to the heated wall leads to nonmeasurable increase of the heat transfer in the same Re regime as long as they do not lead to an interaction with the wall adjacent boundary layers. 2. Mechanical Tps used in an electrically insulated rectangular duct improved the heat transfer up to seven times compared to slug flow, but the pressure drop can increase also up to 300%. In a cost-benefit analysis, the advantageous parameter regime for applying this method is determined. 3. Experiments performed in a flat box both in a vertical and a horizontal arrangement within a horizontal magnetic field show the expected increase of damping of the fluid motion with increasing Hartmann number M. At high M, buoyant convection will be completely suppressed in the horizontal case. In the vertical setup, the fluid motion is reduced to one large vortex leading to a decreasing heat transfer between heated and cooled plate to pure heat conduction. From an analysis of the experimental and theoretical results, general design criteria are derived for the orientation and shape of the first Mall coolant ducts of self-cooled liquid metal blankets. Methods to generate additional turbulence within the flow, which can improve the heat transfer further are elaborated.

The isotope exchange reaction that occurs when the chemical form of tritium in the gas phase is in the molecular form, i.e., HT or T-2, has been named isotope exchange reaction 1, and that which occurs when tritium in the gas phase is in water form, i.e., HTO or T2O, has been named isotope exchange reaction 2. The rate of isotope exchange reaction 2 is experimentally quantified, and the rate is observed to be about one-third of the rate of adsorption, The trapping and release behavior of tritium from the piping surface due to isotope exchange reaction 2 is also discussed. It is certified that swamping of water vapor to process gas is effective to release tritium from the surface contaminated with tritium.

A pion production target (liquid lithium) and a synthesizer [liquid deuterium-tritium (D-T) mixture] are considered. Negative pions a reproduced inside a 17/7 T magnetic field by an intense (2-GeV, 12-mA) deuteron beam interacting with the 150-cm-long, 0.75-cm-radius lithium target. Muons from the pion decay are collected in the backward direction and stopped in the D-T mixture of the synthesizer. The synthesizer has the shape of a 10-cm-radius sphere surrounded by two 0.03-cm-thick titanium shells. At 100 mu CF events/muon, it can produce up to 10(17)n/s of 14-MeV neutrons. A quasi-isotropic neutron flux up to 10(14) n/cm(2).s(-1) cam be achieved in the test volume of similar to2.5 l with an irradiated surface of similar to 350 cm(2). The thermophysical and thermotechnical analyses show that the technological limits are not exceeded.

The synthesizer is connected to an external cooler by input and output pipelines. The optimal mixture composition, synthesizer layout, and dimensions ave determined The possibility of creating a D-T mixture flow with a quasi-uniform velocity distribution is demonstrated. Possible vortexes were found to be eliminated by installation of corresponding hydraulic resistance in the shape of a spherical shell segment. At the mu CF-INS operation with its design parameters [neutron flux as high as 10(14)n/(cm(2).s)], the total heat deposit in the D-T mixture due to fusion and charged-particle ionization losses is estimated at similar to 117 kW. However, even at such conditions, with the appropriate synthesizer geometry and mass flow rate, the mixture temperature does not exceed the boiling point in any part of the synthesizer.

J	Meade, DM				Meade, DM			Fusion Ignition Research Experiment (FIRE)	FUSION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th Topical Meeting on the Technology of Fusion Energy	OCT 15-19, 2000	PARK CITY, UTAH	Amer Nucl Soc				Experiments are needed to test and extend present understanding of confinement, macroscopic stability, alpha-driven instabilities, and particle/power exhaust in plasmas dominated by alpha heating. A. design study of a Fusion Ignition Research Experiment(FIRE) is underway to assess near term opportunities for producing and studying fusion dominated plasmas in the laboratory. The emphasis is on understanding the behavior of fusion plasmas dominated by alpha heating (Q greater than or equal to 5) that are sustained for a duration comparable to the characteristic plasma time scales (greater than or equal to 20 tau (E) and similar to 1.5 tau (skin), where tau (skin) is the time for the plasma current profile to redistribute at fixed current). These requirements can be satisfied with BeCu/OFHC toroidal field coils and OFHC poloidal coils that are pre-cooled to 77 degreesK prior to the pulse. The plasma facing components will have tungsten divertor plates and Be first wall tiles. No graphite is allowed inside the vacuum vessel due to tritium retention issues. The mission of FIRE is to attain, explore, understand and optimize alpha-dominated plasmas to provide knowledge for the design of attractive magnetic fusion energy systems. The programmatic strategy is to access the alpha-heating-dominated regime with confidence using the present advanced tokamak data base (e.g., Elmy-H-mode, less than or equal to 0.75 Greenwald density) while maintaining the flexibility for accessing and exploring other advanced tokamak modes (e. g., reversed shear, pellet enhanced performance) at lower magnetic fields and fusion power for longer durations in later stages of the experimental program. A major constraint. is to develop a design concept that could meet these physics objectives with a construction cost in the range of $1B.

Facilities and systems are developed on the basis of a "greenfield" site, with no benefit for existing facilities, but also without any constraints on the potential arrangement. Because FIRE will operate deuterium-tritium plasmas for pulse lengths on the order of 20 seconds, FIRE will require a moderate on-site tritium inventory. FIRE buildings and systems must be designed and licensed to comply with regulations for nuclear facilities. They must also include systems to manage tritium and tritiated water, activated dust, and radioactive waste material. Maintenance activities on FIRE will require the use of remote handling systems to remove and transport tokamak parts to hot cell facilities. Major tokamak service connections will be required to feed power to the copper magnet system and deliver plasma-heating energy to ICRF antennae. Competition for access to the tokamak for service connections and repair activities will constrain the overall arrangement and routing of services. This paper examines the design implications for the fuel supply, vacuum pumping, fuel recovery, cooling, and other balance of plant systems that contribute to the control of radioactive materials. It also examines the design implications for the tokamak test cell, hot cells, structures to house key services, and routing of service connections to the tokamak. Site requirements, a generic site plan, and conceptual building arrangements are provided.

The design contains many innovative features to improve both the physics and engineering performance of the system. From the safety and environmental perspective, there is greater depth to the overall analysis than in past ARIES studies. For ARIES-AT, the overall spectrum of off-normal events to be examined has been broadened. They include conventional loss of coolant and loss of flow events, an ex-vessel loss of coolant, and in-vessel off-normal events that mobilize in-vessel inventories (e.g. tritium and tokamak dust) and bypass primary confinement such as a Loss of Vacuum and an in-vessel loss of coolant with bypass. This broader examination of accidents improves the robustness of the design from the safety perspective and gives additional confidence that the facility can meet the no-evacuation requirement. We also provide a systematic assessment of the design to address key safety functions such as confinement, decay heat removal, and chemical energy control. In the area of waste management, waste is classified by both the volume of the component and its hazard. In comparison to previous ARIES designs, the overall waste volume is less because of the compact design.

The dependence of these scenarios on both the fusion development and implementation paths has been assessed. A range of implementation paths has been studied. The deployment of CANDU fission power plants in Canada and the deployment of fission power plants in France have been assessed as possible models for U.S. fusion deployment. The waste production and resource (including tritium) needs have been assessed. The conclusion that can be drawn from these studies is that it is challenging to make a significant impact on energy production during this century. However, the rapid deployment of fission power plants in Canada and France supports fusion implementation scenarios for the U.S. with significant power production during this century. If we can meet the schedule requirements then the resource needs and waste production are found to be manageable problems.

The implementation capacity of fusion power reactors depends upon the net tritium breeding gain and a requirement of the initial supply of tritium for a steady commercial operation. In the reference case, the maximum implementation capacity is 7 GWe in 10 years after the year of fusion introduction, 118 GWe in 20 years and 488 GWe in 25 years. It is mainly limited by the industrial construction capacity after 25 years. The maximum implementation capacity is largely depends on the preparation interval of operation as well as the tritium breeding performance. It means that subsequent reactors must start operation as soon as possible not to leave produced tritium. The requirement to the tritium breeding for a satisfactory implementation effusion power plants is also discussed. In the case that fusion implementation is similar to the increase of fission reactors in last 40 years, tritium breeding ratio of 1.08 will be required for the early plants. On the other hand, tritium breeding ratio of 1.02 is sufficient when fusion plants are widely deployed.

J	Gohar, Y				Gohar, Y			Flibe blanket concept for transmuting transuranic elements and long lived fission products	FUSION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th Topical Meeting on the Technology of Fusion Energy	OCT 15-19, 2000	PARK CITY, UTAH	Amer Nucl Soc				A Molten salt (Flibe) fusion blanket concept has been developed to solve the disposition problems of the spent nuclear fuel and the transuranic elements. This blanket concept can achieve the top rated solution, the complete elimination of the transuranic elements and the long-lived fission products. Small driven fusion devices with low neutron wall loading and low neutron fluence can perform this function. A 344-MW fusion power from D-T plasmas for thirty years with an availability factor of 0.75 can dispose of 70,000 tons of the US inventory of spent nuclear fuel generated up to the year 2015. In addition, the utilization of this blanket concept eliminates the need for a geological repository site for these materials, which is a major advantage. This application provides an excellent opportunity to develop and to enhance the public acceptance of the fusion energy for the future. The energy from the transmutation process is utilized to produce revenue. Flibe, lithium-lead eutectic, and liquid lead are possible candidates. The liquid blankets have several features, which are suited for this application. It can operate at constant thermal power without interruption for refueling by adjusting the concentration of the transuranic elements and lithium-6. These liquids operate at low-pressure, which reduces the primary stresses in the structure material. Development and fabrication costs of solid transuranic materials are eliminated. Burnup limit of the transuranic elements due to radiation effects is eliminated. Heat is generated within the liquid, which simplifies the heat removal process without producing thermal stresses. These blanket concepts have large negative temperature coefficient with respect to the blanket reactivity, which enhances the safety performance. These liquids are chemically and thermally stable under irradiation conditions, which minimize the radioactive waste volume. The operational record of the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor with Flibe was very successful, which established the technical bases for this application. This paper provides the technical analyses and the performance of the Flibe blanket concept as an example of this class of blankets.

J	Morgan, MJ; Tosten, MH				Morgan, MJ; Tosten, MH			Tritium and decay helium effects on cracking thresholds and velocities in stainless steel	FUSION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th Topical Meeting on the Technology of Fusion Energy	OCT 15-19, 2000	PARK CITY, UTAH	Amer Nucl Soc				Crack initiation and propagation were studied in three tritium-exposed stainless steels. The purpose was to measure cracking thresholds and velocities as a function of helium concentration in Type 21-6-9 stainless steel and compare the results to earlier measurements on Types 316L and 304L steels. Fracture toughness specimens were cut from forgings, fatigue-cracked and exposed to tritium at 423 K and 31 MPa; The samples were aged for selected times at 273 K to " build-in " He-3 from tritium decay. Tritium concentrations ranged from 0-2600 atomic parts-per-million (appm) and He-3 concentrations ranged from 0-600 appm. The samples were step-loaded at room temperature in air using a screw-driven mechanical testing machine and held at fixed displacement until crack initiation was detected. Crack propagation was monitored by continuously recording the drop in load until crack arrest. Threshold stress intensity was calculated from the load and the crack length at the end of the test. Crack velocities were determined from the load-time records and compliance relationships and verified on some samples using a DC potential-drop technique. The crack path was along grain and twin boundaries. For 21-6-9, the threshold for cracking decreased with increasing helium concentrations from about 90 MPa-m(1/2) (50 appm helium) to 25 MPa-m(1/2) (600 appm helium). Steady-state-crack velocities averaged 10(-7) m/s and was not strongly dependent on helium concentration. The data show that embrittlement of tritium-exposed stainless steels is a form of hydrogen embrittlement made worse by the hardening of the microstructure from nanometer-sized helium bubbles that build-in with tritium decay.

Release behavior of tritium produced in the neutron-irradiated Li4SiO4 is investigated by the Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS). Thermal annealing behavior of the irradiation damages was also studied by Electron Spin Resonance CESR) method. These experimental results showed that the annealing process of the damages occurred in the almost same temperature range of tritium released from the neutron-irradiated Li4SiO4 This suggested that the thermal annealing processes of the damages were closely correlated with the tritium release process. It was also found that the thermal annealing consisted of two processes. The activation energies of the two processes were determined to be 0.5 eV and 0.96 eV, respectively.

The thrust of our initial effort on the blanket has been to seek solutions as close to present-day technology as possible, and we have therefore focused on steel structure with helium coolant. The simple FRC cylindrical geometry has allowed us reasonable success due to the low FRC magnetic field and relatively easy maintenance. In this design the breeder is Li2O tubes. The design is modular with 10 modules each 2.5 m long. The inner radius of the first wall is 2.0 m and the FW/blanket/shield thickness is about 2 m. The surface heat flux will be radiation dominated, fairly uniform, and relatively low, because most of the charged particles follow the magnetic flux tubes to the end walls. The neutron wall loading is 5 MW/m(2) In this design the surface heat flux equals 0.19 MW/m(2). The maximum Li2O tube temperature is 1003 degreesC. The helium exit temperature from the heat exchanger is about 800 degreesC which allows a thermal efficiency of about 52%. The local tritium breeding ratio (TBR) equals 1.1 and is sufficient because in the FRC geometry the plasma has nearly full coverage. The helium pumping power is I MW. The coolant routing is optimized to limit the steel maximum temperature to 635 degreesC. The same concept would be applicable to a spherical torus and spheromak.

To achieve a relatively low cost of electricity, the cost to produce these targets will need to be less than approximately $0.25 per target. In this paper the status on the development of concepts for a TFF to produce targets for a heavy ion fusion (HIF) reactor, such as HYLIFE II, and a laser direct drive fusion reactor such as Sombrero, is discussed. The baseline target that is produced in the HIF TFF is similar to the close-coupled indirect drive target designed by Callahan-Miller and Tabak at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. This target consists of a cryogenic hohlraum that is made of a metal case and a variety of metal foams and metal-doped organic foams. The target contains a DT-filled CH capsule. The baseline direct drive target is the design developed by Bodner and coworkers at Naval Research Laboratory. HIF targets can be filled with DT before or after assembly of the capsule into the hohlraum. Assembly of targets before filling allows assembly operations to be done at room temperature, but tritium inventories are much larger due to the large volume that the hohlraum occupies in the fill system. Assembly of targets cold after filling allows substantial reduction in tritium inventory, but this requires assembly of targets at cryogenic temperature. A model being developed to evaluate the tritium inventories associated with each of the assembly and fill options indicates that filling targets before assembling the capsule into the hohlraum, filling at temperatures as high as possible, and reducing dead-volumes in the fill system as much as possible offers the potential to reduce tritium inventories to acceptable levels. Use of enhanced DT ice layering techniques, such as infrared layering can reduce tritium inventories significantly by reducing the layering time and therefore the number of capsules being layered. Current processes for fabrication of ICF capsules can most likely be easily scaled up to produce capsules at rates needed for an TFE plant.

Also, MHD may have strong impact on heat transfer if the flow is perpendicular to the magnetic field. The issues associated with the REDOX reaction and the MHD issues have to be resolved by both experimental program and numerical solutions.

An alternative concept of free surface using a capillary force is shown to be feasible even in helical systems, where a spiral flow is formed and drastically enhances the heat transfer efficiency. The nuclear property of Flibe blanket is modified with increasing Be amount and adopting carbon reflector, resulting the local TBR of 1.3. As an optional technique, 50% enrichment of Li-6 gives the maximum TBR of 1.4.

The main chemical form of tritium-containing species in Flibe was controlled to HT or TF by H, partial pressure and F potential in an in-pile experimental system. The release rate coefficients of HT and HF, and HT/TF ratio in released tritium under various H,partial pressure were observed. The mechanism in chemistry change was considered by a model assuming an isotopic exchange reaction. Increase of HT release rate was observed by the addition of Be metal into Flibe. HT permeation rate coefficient through Monel Metal and SUS316 tubing wall contacting with Flibe were smaller by one order of magnitude than HT release rate coefficient.

This experimental system is designed to measure the mobilization of tritium, fluorine, and other constituents in molten Flibe following trace neutron irradiation at fusion-relevant temperatures (500-1000 degreesC). Trace neutron irradiation is achieved using a spontaneous fission Cf-252 source that produces a relatively uniform concentration of tritium in the Flibe. The experimental goals aim to better understand the mechanisms, mobilization rates, and physiochemical forms of tritium mobilized from the Flibe along with other potentially detectable radioactive isotopes and toxic-material species under inert-gas, air, and steam-ingress conditions. System design details are discussed which include neutronic studies to optimize tritium production, thermal design to maintain and isolate molten Flibe, and instrumentation to meet experimental goals.

J	Youssef, MZ; Khater, H; Kotschenreuther, M				Youssef, MZ; Khater, H; Kotschenreuther, M			Plasma stabilization conducting shells end their impact on TBR and activation in CLIFF design	FUSION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th Topical Meeting on the Technology of Fusion Energy	OCT 15-19, 2000	PARK CITY, UTAH	Amer Nucl Soc			POWER	Plasma stabilization and plasma elongation are best achieved by keeping a stabilizing shell as close as possible to the plasma. In CLiFF design, a 2-cm-thick flowing liquid layer is placed in front of a solid FW and is thought to be used as an active conduction shell if its conductance is relatively high such as with liquid lithium. On the other hand, higher conductance is achieved by solid shells (e.g. Cu, Al, FS, W, V alloy). In the present study, the adverse effect of this stabilizing shell (whether it is liquid or solid material) on tritium breeding ratio (TBR) is investigated. Among the design features that quantify this effect are: the type of breeder and structure, the degree of Li-6 enrichment, the material and thickness of the shell, and whether or not there is a front beryllium multiplying zone in the blanket. Additionally, the presence of a solid conducting shell near the FW will impose a safety concern in the case of LOCA. The present study addresses this concern and comparison of the level of decay heat and waste disposal rating is made among the candidate materials for the stabilizing shell.

Liquid walls-offer the advantage of protecting solid structure behind them from excessive damage from neutrons originated in the plasma and thus have the capability for high power density applications; the central research focus of the Advanced Power Extraction (APEX) study. In the present parametric and scoping work, several combinations of liquid breeder and structure type where investigated. The aim is to maximize local tritium breeding ratio (TBR), power multiplication, and ensuring that the vacuum vessel and toroidal coils are protected from excessive radiation. The candidate liquid breeders considered are Li, Flibe, and Sn-Li. Vanadium-alloy is deployed with Li while either Ferritic steel or SiC is deployed with Flibe and Sn-Li. Deployment of other refractory alloys and their impact on TBR was also studied. The introduction of a beryllium multiplier zone in the blanket was shown to enhance tritium production capability, particularly for those liquid breeders whose TBRs are marginal.

Upgraded to TMAP4, it was verified and validated at the INEEL. The further upgrade of the code to TMAP2000 was accomplished in response to several needs. TMAP and TMAP4 had the capacity to deal with only a single trap for diffusing gaseous species in solid structures. TMAP2000 has been revised to include up to three separate traps and to keep track separately of each of up to 10 diffusing species in each of the traps. The original code experienced problems in dealing with heteronuclear molecule formation such as HD and DT. That has been corrected. A further sophistication is the addition of non-diffusing surface species and surface binding energy dynamics options. TMAP2000 will accommodate up to 30 such surface species. Additionally, TMAP2000 allows simulation of surface fluxes dependent on a surface binding energy and an adsorption barrier energy. All of the previously existing features for heat transfer, flows between enclosures, and chemical reactions within the enclosures have been retained, but the allowed problem size and complexity have been significantly increased to take advantage of the greater memory and speed available on modern computers.

Permeation experiment was carried out with pure tungsten foils (34 mm in diameter, 25 micro-m in thickness, and 99.5% purity) annealed at 1273 K for 3 hours in vacuum and unannealed one. Those permeation characteristics at transient state were analyzed by TMAP4 code. As a result, the feature of the trap site in the unannealed tungsten specimen was revealed that which has about 0.9 eV trap energy and 40ppm-trap density, By the analysis of the permeation behavior through the annealed tungsten, above trap sites disappeared by specimen annealing, and the permeation through annealed tungsten was found to be expressed by simple diffusion equation with the effective diffusion coefficient. However, it may involve the trapping parameter, which is virtually indistinguishable from reduction of diffusion coefficient, in itself.

Two chemical states of implanted deuterium were observed in SiC. It was suggested that the one was contribution of deuterium in interstitial, and the other was contribution of deuterium in defects resulted by deuterium ion (D-2(+)) implantation. From the results for Si, it was found that implanted deuterium existed in Si with three chemical states. The deuterium behavior in graphite was different with that in SiC and in Si. The deuterium chemical behavior in SiC was discussed in comparison with that implanted into Si and graphite.

J	Reyes, S; Latkowski, JF; del Rio, JG; Sanz, J				Reyes, S; Latkowski, JF; del Rio, JG; Sanz, J			Accident doses analysis of the SOMBRERO inertial fusion energy power plant design	FUSION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th Topical Meeting on the Technology of Fusion Energy	OCT 15-19, 2000	PARK CITY, UTAH	Amer Nucl Soc				SOMBRERO (solid moving breeder reactor) is a conceptual design of a 1000 MWe laser-driven inertial fusion energy (IFE) power plant. An important goal of the original study was the achievement of a safe and environmentally attractive reactor of relatively simple design. However, recent work has pointed out some key issues involving safety that were not completely addressed at that time, and which need to be reviewed in order to maximize the SOMBRERO design attractiveness. The present work uses a set of computer codes traditionally used for magnetic fusion safety studies (CHEMCON, MELCOR), which have been adopted and adapted for use in IFE safety analysis. Here we consider a loss of flow accident (LOFA) combined with simultaneous loss of vacuum accident (LOVA) produced by a breach in the confinement building. Although confinement failure would be a very unlikely event, it must be postulated in order to produce significant off-site doses. The CHEMCON code is used to simulate the longterm thermal transient in the reactor structures resulting from oxidation and radioactive decay heat. MELCOR is used to simulate a wide range of physical phenomena including thermal-hydraulics, heat transfer, aerosol physics and fusion product release and transport. As specified in the DOE Fusion Safety Standards, an off-site dose below 1 rem (10 mSv) is the requirement to avoid public sheltering and evacuation.

Recently we developed a base case for a severe accident scenario in order to calculate accident doses for HYLIFE-II. It consisted of a total loss of coolant accident (LOCA) in which all the liquid flibe (Li(2)BeF(4)) was lost at the beginning of the transient. Results showed that the off-site dose was below the limit given by the DOE Fusion Safety Standards for public protection in case of accident, and that this dose was dominated by the tritium released during the accident. In order to further advance a complete safety analysis for HYLIFE-II, a range of other accident scenarios must be considered. In this work, we introduce a new version of the MELCOR thermal-hydraulics code recently developed by the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) that uses flibe as the working fluid. We have focused on a loss of flow accident (LOFA), with simultaneous failure of the blanket structure and the beam Cubes that connect the chamber with the outside of the confinement building. This constitutes the bypass needed to communicate the target chamber with the environment. Once the release fractions of the various radioactivity sources are known, we calculate off-site doses under different conditions as a consequence of the accident.

Target fill is the key subtask in determining the overall tritium inventory for the plant. By segmenting the inventory into multiple, parallel production lines-each with its own fill canister-and including an expansion tank to limit releases, it appears possible for a target fabrication facility to meet the accident dose goals of 10 mSv (1 rem) set forth in the Department of Energy's Fusion Safety Standards. For indirect-drive targets, we calculate release fractions for elements from lithium to bismuth and show that nearly all elements meet the dose goal. Our work suggests directions for future R&D that will help reduce total tritium inventories and increase the flexibility of target fabrication facilities.

J	Smolik, GR; Petti, DA; Sharpe, JP; Schuetz, ST				Smolik, GR; Petti, DA; Sharpe, JP; Schuetz, ST			Oxidation and volatilization from tantalum alley during air exposure	FUSION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th Topical Meeting on the Technology of Fusion Energy	OCT 15-19, 2000	PARK CITY, UTAH	Amer Nucl Soc				Tantalum alloys are one of the refractory metals with renewed consideration for high temperatures in fusion reactor applications. Tantalum alloys perform well in protective environments but are oxidized readily in gases containing higher oxygen levels. In addition, the radioactive isotope Ta-182 would be produced in tantalum and could be a significant contributor to dose if mobilized. Other isotopes of importance are produced from tungsten and hafnium. Mobilization of activated products during an accident with air ingress is therefore a safety issue. In this study, we measured the extent of oxidation and mobilization from tantalum alloy T-222 oxidized in flowing air between 500 and 1200 degrees C. This alloy nominally contains 10 wt% tungsten, 2.5 wt% hafnium and 0.01 wt% carbon. We found that the mobilization of Ta and Hf was closely linked to the occurrence of oxide spalling. These elements showed no migration from the test chamber. Some W was mobilized by volatilization as evidenced by transport from the chamber. Tungsten volatilization could occur primarily during initial stages of oxidation before the formation of an oxide scale impedes the process. The mobilization of Ta and W are presented in terms of the mass flux (g/m(2)-h) as a function of test temperature. These measurements along with specific designs, activation calculations, and accident scenarios provide information useful for dose calculations of future fusion devices.

The cesium isotopes, Cs-134 and Cs-136, and the iodine isotope, I-126, would produce a high level of off-site dose (62.13 rem) at the plant site boundary if they were released entirely to the environment during an accident. The xenon gas is pumped out of the chamber (recycled) during operation to remove unburned T-2 and D-2. Removing the Cs and I isotopes from the Xe gas during this recycling process will reduce the Cs and I inventories inside the chamber to negligible values. This process limited the off-site dose caused by the accidental release of Xe from the chamber of the SOMBRERO power plant to 29.9 mrem, which is less than the 1 rem no-evacuation limit. Using krypton, argon or neon as fill gases will result in producing lower levels of off-site dose than xenon.
