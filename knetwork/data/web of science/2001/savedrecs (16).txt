Activation of blankets and shields used during a plant lifetime was evaluated by an activation calculation code taking into accounts of the distribution of neutron wall loading and the scenario of blanket replacement. Limits on surface dose limits define the feasibility of recycling by remote handling (RHR) and by hands-on operation (HOR). After 50 years for decay of activated components, surface dose rate of most of components exceeds 10 mSv/h and cannot be recycled. Some of shields are lower than 10 mSv/h and have a possibility of RHR. After 100 years, surface dose rate of all components is lower than 3 mSv/h, and RHR is feasible. Half of shields are lower than 0.01 mSv/h and have a possibility of HOR. After 225 years, dose rate of all components is lower than I mSv/h. RHR with a relatively simple shielding precaution may be feasible In the cases of 150 years or later, little degradation of dose rate can be expected. Therefore, the used components should be managed within approximately 125 years by suitable methods.

The samples used in this study were stainless steel 304 with three types of surface finish, aluminum alloy A-5052 with two types of surface finish, three types of O-ring and two types of carbon fiber reinforced plastic. After the samples were exposed in the tritiated moisture environment, the concentration of tritium adsorbed on the specimen was measured and the decontamination experiments using gas purges with three different moisture concentrations were performed. It is found that tritium does not adsorb on stainless much and oxide layer adsorbs significant tritium in Al alloy. The amount of tritium in rubber is found to relate with the permeability, solubility and tolerance for water vapor. In case of carbon fiber reinforced plastic, almost adsorbed tritium could not removed by gas purge.

The area of the permeation window is estimated to be comparatively small unless very low tritium partial pressure is demanded for the system. It is probable that the tritium transfer rate is controlled not by permeation through the window material (Nb or ferrite steel) but diffusion in Flibe. Since tritium diffusion in the molten salt is also determination of the recovery rate in the gas-bubble column from Flibe to He, the evaluation of the tritium diffusion resistance in the molten salt is crucial for its design.

In this study, a four-column cascade was proposed considering the 450 seconds burn / 1350 seconds dwell operation scenario of ITER-FEAT instead of the present five-column cascade design of the FDR-ITER. This proposed cascade is found to be effective in all operation phases. The impact of the optional 3000 seconds burn / 9000 seconds dwell operation scenario on the present design is also discussed in this paper. Tritium concentration in the released hydrogen stream into environment must always be controlled to be lower than the regulation limit for stack release, and the two-column system for treatment of this flow is found to be effective for meeting this requirement.

One side of the cell was exposed to pure hydrogen and the other was exposed to 0.01 similar to 10 vol % of hydrogen balanced with helium. Static and dynamic hydrogen pumping properties of the cell were evaluated Electromotive force generated between two electrodes by the difference of hydrogen concentration was measured as static characteristics. In the region of the ratio of hydrogen partial pressure up to 100, the electrochemical potential driven by the difference of hydrogen partial pressure agreed well with the theoretical values derived from Nernst's law. The hydrogen pumping capacity was measured as the current density with applied DC. Hydrogen was selectively transferred at the current density of 7mA/cm(2) at 873K and 9mA/cm(2) at 973K which satisfy our projected requirement (above 5mA/cm(2)) for applying to the blanket tritium recovery system. Voltage-induced degradation of the cell material accompanied with water vapor generation was observed, and voltage region to avoid this degradation was identified.

This program used a Reference Female phantom shell filled with radioactive tissue-substitute polyurethane to simulate a uniform fission-product distribution in soft tissues. The nuclides used were Cs-137 and Co-60. The phantom also contained K-40 homogeneously distributed in an amount similar to a Reference Female to produce a representative Compton background in the resulting spectra. Participants were asked to identify the nuclides and report activities for all except K-40. They were also asked to measure the precision of counting and supply the MDA for Cs-137 and Co-60. The bias results were in the range of -30% to +80% with most facilities falling inside the range of -25% to +50% (Canadian and U.S. acceptable performance criteria). Results indicated that there was no measurable size dependency for this phantom. All reported precisions were less than 5% but NaI detector based systems seemed to have a systematic uncertainty in addition to Poisson variability. Contrarily, this was not found for Ge detector based systems. MDA data was scattered (14-3,500 Bq for Cs-137 and 9-460 Bq for Co-60) and only suggested that lengthening the counting time improves MDA. Health Phys. 80(3):214-224; 2001.

The counting features of the system were investigated by using a neck-thyroid phantom. A clear thyroid image was obtained at thin prethyroid tissue thicknesses and short distances between IP and neck surface. The characteristic I-125 thyroid image made it possible to visually confirm that the thyroid definitely accumulated I-125. The counting efficiency in 100xcps Bq(-1) of the imaging plate system was determined by setting a region of interest on the thyroid image resulting in a maximum efficiency of 0.5%. The higher efficiency was obtained for thinner tissue thickness overlaying the thyroid, smaller thyroids, and shorter distances between the imaging plate and neck surface.

J	Heikkinen, MSA; Harley, NH				Heikkinen, MSA; Harley, NH			Calculation of the air concentrations of serially decaying nuclides - A new method applied to radon progeny	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						air sampling; radon progeny; radioactivity, environmental; computer calculations	DAUGHTERS	A new calculation method is presented for determining the air concentrations of any serially decaying nuclides. This new method is easily incorporated into a Basic or spreadsheet program that is used to record the decay data. Specifically, the measurements were designed to illustrate radon progeny from a filter sample that is gross-alpha counted. The method is based on regressing the decay data, recorded in 1-min intervals, on the time after the end of sampling with an equation that describes the alpha activity as a function of the decay exponentials, e(-lambdat). The results from both generated data and experimental filter samples were compared to the results obtained by two other well-known methods. All the methods give comparable estimates for the progeny air concentrations; non-linear regression and weighting by variances produces the smallest error estimates with the method presented here.

X rays and photons from the decay of uranium and thorium remaining on the filter after each dissolution period were also directly measured using a planar germanium detector as a means for rapidly evaluating the solubility of the uranium-bearing dusts. Results of these analyses demonstrate that two distinct types of uranium-bearing dusts were collected on the filters depending upon the location of the air samplers, The first material exhibited a dissolution half-time much less than 1 d and was most likely UO3. The dissolution rate of the second material, which was most likely U3O8, exhibited two components. Approximately one-third of this material dissolved with a half time much less than 1 d. The remaining two-thirds of the material dissolved with half times between 230 +/- 16 d and 1,350 +/- 202 d. The dissolution rates for uranium determined by radiochemical analysis and by gamma spectrometry were similar, However, gamma spectrometry analysis suggested a difference between the half times of U-238 and its initial decay product Th-234, which may have important implications for in vivo monitoring of uranium.

In response to concern that exposure to depleted uranium may have been a cause of health problems suffered by returning veterans of that war, an already existing surveillance program following depleted uranium "friendly fire" victims was enlarged to assess the wider veteran community's exposure to depleted uranium. Between August 1998 and December 1999, 169 Gulf War veterans submitted 24-h urine samples for determination of urinary uranium concentration and questionnaires describing their potential exposures to depleted uranium while in the Gulf War theatre. Depleted uranium exposure assessment was determined from 30 separate questionnaire items condensed into 19 distinct exposure scenarios. Results of urine uranium analysis were stratified into high and low uranium groups with 0.05 mug uranium/g creatinine being the cut point and approximate upper limit of the normal population distribution. Twelve individuals (7.1%) exhibited urine uranium values in the high range, while the remaining 157 had urine uranium values in the low range. A repeat test of urine for 6 of these 12 produced uranium results in the low range for 3 of these individuals. Exposure scenarios of the high and low uranium groups were similar with the presence of retained shrapnel being the only scenario predictive of a high urine uranium value. Results emphasize the unlikely occurrence of an elevated urine uranium result and consequently any uranium-related health effects in the absence of retained depleted uranium metal fragments in the veterans.

However, the performance of such instruments is not sufficiently specified in this type of application, so ASM asked the Nuclear Engineering Department of the Polytechnic elf Milan to draw up a test protocol and to lead the following experimental campaign. A truck trailer and a source container were prepared ad hoc, and three different systems underwent a sensitivity and a false alarm test. On the basis of the final results, the performance characteristics of various monitoring systems in this particular application were established with the correct degree of accuracy.

Materials and methods: Wistar strain male rats continuously ingested tritiated water as drinking water and tritiated wheat as food for 14 weeks. Urine and tissue samples were obtained and total tritium in the fresh wet samples and organically hound tritium (OBT) in the freeze-dried samples were determined. Results: The biokinetics of tritium was different between the two modes of exposure. The concentration of total tritium in the tissues exposed to tritiated water attained a steady-state condition by 2-3 weeks. The steady-state condition in the case of exposure to tritiated wheat was not observed for 10 weeks after the start of exposure in the majority of tissues. The relatively efficient and prolonged OBT formation during chronic exposure to tritiated wheat resulted in relatively high incorporation and retention of tritium in the tissues compared with those for exposure to the same activity of tritiated water. Conclusion: Radiation dose rates estimated at the end of continuous ingestion showed that tritiated wheat gave higher dose rates than tritiated water by a factor of 1.3 to 4.5, but the factors were within 2.0 in the majority of tissues except for small intestine and adipose tissue.

Materials and methods: Rats were exposed to a single whole-body dose of gamma radiation (6 Gy; 0.75 Gy.min(-1)). Three days after irradiation they were orally and/or intravenously contaminated with 100 mug.kg(-1) uranium or 3 kBq.kg(-1) neptunium. The gastrointestinal absorption and organ distribution of both radionuclides were measured 6 days after irradiation. Results: External irradiation increased the intestinal transit time of uranium and neptunium but had no effect on their gastrointestinal absorption. The average fractional absorption was determined to be 0.93 and 0.98% (uranium) and 4.7 and 4.8% (neptunium) for the irradiated and non-irradiated rats respectively. The excretion of uranium and neptunium was not affected by the irradiation.

Based on various design studies a machine with 6.2 m major radius and aspect ratio 3.1 has been selected. Two main regimes of operation are foreseen namely ELMy H-mode and steady-state operation, the latter in discharges with internal transport barriers (ITB). In ELMy H-mode, an important issue is the maximum tolerable energy for repetitive pulsed energy loads (ELMs) of 0.4 and 0.64 MJ m(-2) for CFC and W, respectively, in order to achieve adequate divertor lifetimes (ca. a few 1000 discharges). Based on present predictions there is only a marginal compatibility of the expected ELM energy loads with these thresholds. Reducing the ELM size, by gas puffing, tends to reduce also the energy confinement. The regimes with ITB may pose a problem for the divertor operation due to the expected low plasma edge density and the large power crossing the separatrix (up to 130 MW). Using the present knowledge about plasma-wall interaction (erosion in steady and pulsed loads, re-deposition as well as of tritium co-deposition), the majority of the plasma facing surface has to be clad with Be and W. At present, a small area of CFC at the divertor strike zones is foreseen in the reference design. However, due to the relatively high T co-deposition rate predicted, the use of CFC may not be possible in a D-T machine. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The Ion-surface InterAction Experiment (IIAX) has been optimized to reliably measure the absolute sputtering yield of many ion-target combinations including solid and liquid lithium. A Colutron ion source is used to create and accelerate gaseous or metal ions onto a liquid metal target. The bombarding ions are mass-selected through an E X B filter and decelerated near the target. The target can be rotated in order to provide variation in the angle of incidence. Deuterium plasma from a hollow cathode source is used to remove any remaining oxides. Upon melting of the sample a thin oxide layer forms and is cleaved by an in situ arm. Results show that sputtering yields from liquid tin-lithium are larger than pure lithium. In addition, modeling with VFTRIM-3D confirms that Li atoms segregate to the surface of liquid tin-lithium. This is consistent with results of ion fraction of sputtered atoms, which show a sputtered-atom ion fraction of 65% for liquid tin-lithium, equal to pure liquid lithium, and <10% for solid tin-lithium. <(c)> 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Retained deuterium quantities were measured using thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS). Retention in annealed CVD-W and W1%La. for implantation temperatures less than 200 degreesC, is below that in annealed W foil, indicating that trapping may be affected by the different material defect structures. For implantation temperatures less than 300 degreesC, retention in CVD-W2C is somewhat higher than that in CVD-W, indicating trapping could be enhanced by trace carbon impurities, differences in W2C material structure and recoil carbon-induced material damage. Implantation into C-coated W resulted in orders of magnitude more retention than in uncoated material, because of trapping in the carbon coating. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A temperature dependence exists clearly below 100 eV. For 20 eV D, the yield is 0.5% at 300 K and 1.5% in the maximum at 500 K. Contrary to Si erosion, no formation of silane was observed with mass spectrometry. Hydrocarbons, predominantly CD4 molecules, are only found at 20 eV. From the erosion of a thin SiC layer investigated using MeV ion beam analysis, segregation and preferential erosion of carbon are ruled out, because the layer thickness decreases while the composition stays constant. As no volatile silane production is detected, it is assumed that sputtering of Si or silane precursors with low binding energy occurs at low ion energies. The mechanism of the chemical erosion of Si in presence of C and absence of C is different. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The erosion yields of the WC- and V8C7-doped graphites are reduced by a factor of 2 for 30 eV D at 300 K compared to pure graphite. This observed reduction is partly attributed to surface enrichment of carbide due to preferential C erosion. The other part is assigned to changes in the chemical erosion process (Y-surf) as well as at elevated temperatures in the thermal activated process (Y-therm). The reduction of both erosion processes is determined for all dopants to be more than 25% of the erosion yield of the undoped graphite. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Irradiation of SCW with 1.5 keV D-3(+) ions at 300 K leads to saturation at a much lower incident fluence than seen in polycrystalline tungsten (PCW), but with the same levels of D retention at saturation, approximate to 5 x 10(20) D/m(2). Implantations at 500 Ii reached saturation at a very low incident fluence, below 10(21) D+/m(2), with the amount of D retained at saturation approximate to 1.5 x 10(20) D/m(2). This level is 3-4 times lower than the saturation value for 300 Ii implantation of the same single crystal of tungsten. Deuterium depth profile analysis by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) shows D trapping primarily within the 500 eV D+ ion implantation range for both 300 and 500 Ii profiles. SIMS also revealed that the depth profiles for oxygen and deuterium were similar. When the tungsten was annealed at 500 K for 1 h after implantation at 500 Ii, SIMS indicated that the deuterium retention decreased by an order of magnitude. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

As a result of the microstructural observation, accumulated radiation damage (dislocation loops) due to charge exchange (CX) neutrals were observed only in the specimens pointing to the lower half of plasma and almost no damage in the specimens pointing to the upper side. These results indicate that the lower half of the plasma is the major source for energetic CX neutrals. This anisotropy can be explained by the effect of the gradient B drift of high-energy ions trapped in a toroidal ripple. The mean flux was estimated to 4.2 x 10(17) particles m(-2) s(-1) sr(-1) from the lower side by using the areal density (A.D.) of dislocation loops. The depth distribution of the dislocation loops shows a significant contribution of the high-energy CX neutrals. The energetic CX neutrals will give a great impact on material degradations.

The trapping coefficient eta, which is found from the thermal desorption spectra after implantation, is measured for the energy range of 5-120 eV per deuteron at 60 degrees angle of incidence. The value of eta measured for target cleaned with Ar bombardment and temperature treatment decreases with energy from eta similar to 0.3 at the primary energy E-0 = 120 eV to eta similar to 0.15 at about E-0 = 5 eV. Computer simulations based on the binary collision approximation and performed with taking into account the real target micro relief measured with STM agree with the experimental data rather well.

The retention of 1 keV D ions implanted in W crystals was strongly enhanced by the 10 keV He-4 pre-irradiation to a small dose where a large distortion was created at room temperature. The total amount of D retained in near surface laver of the W crystal did not vary with a range of He pre-implantation dose between 10(19) He/m(2) and 10(21) He/m(2). However, the lattice disorder was significantly accumulated in near surface layer above 10(21) He/m(2) and the thermal release of retained D atoms occurred at higher temperature. For a specimen preirradiated at 850 K, the crystal lattice was not heavily damaged, and trapping sites for the D atoms were uniformly distributed in the He implanted region probably owing to ordered He bubbles.

Weight loss measurements of W samples during sputtering by 2.4 keV C ions at different temperatures in the range between 300 and 1000 It showed a strong temperature dependence. At a certain fluence, which depends on the temperature, the probe's weight starts to increase again. This is due to C enrichment in the surface during ion bombardment, which eventually leads to the formation of a pure C surface. This C film then shields the underlying W from further sputtering and further growth of this film increases the probe's weight. The growth of this him depends critically on the diffusion of C into the W bulk material since this removes C from the surface and thereby increases the W concentration and W erosion. This in turn results in an increased reflection of the incoming C ions. These two coupled mechanisms hinder the growth of the C film with the diffusion accounting for the temperature dependence of the weight loss. To verify this model, C depth profiles in W were determined by means of Rutherford backscattering (RBS) with He ions. To increase sensitivity, the increased cross-section at 5715 keV was used. Analysis of depth profiles measured in the temperature range between 300 and 1000 It show that relevant diffusion processes appear at approximately 800 K, By performing Boltzmann Matano analysis on the measured depth profiles, a concentration dependant diffusion coefficient for C diffusion in W was deduced. The weight loss measurements were simulated using a combination of the Monte Carlo program TRIDYN and the diffusion code PIDAT. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper will summarize recent experiments conducted in PISCES in the areas of: plasma-liquid-metal interactions, the flux dependence of the chemical erosion of graphite, and surface modification to tungsten samples exposed to high-fluence plasmas. Enhanced erosion of liquid-metal samples exposed to plasma is observed for both lithium and gallium samples. The surface stratification of liquid-metals is discussed as a possible explanation. The importance of correction terms in the interpretation of the chemical erosion measurements from graphite samples is then emphasized. And finally, surface analysis of tungsten samples, after deuterium plasma bombardment, has revealed microscopic damage in the surface at ion energies below the sputtering threshold energy. This damage appears to be due to pockets of deuterium gas forming within the tungsten and subsequently rupturing. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Due to preferential sputtering of carbon, the dopants may be enriched at the surface, resulting in an additional reduction of the erosion yield. Dopants in the form of sub-mum precipitates with a very homogeneous distribution lead to in a more effective reduction of both chemical erosion processes, Y-therm and Y-surf. However, dopants may degrade the thermal conductivity of graphite, which has to be avoided. First results on the development of carbon materials doped with different carbides and with optimized microstructure and thermomechanical properties show that VC acts as an effective catalyst for graphitization causing an improvement of the thermal conductivity. It leads further to a reduction of both, the Y-therm and the Y-surf chemical erosion processes, which is partly attributed to surface enrichment but is also the result of a chemical influence, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The experiment has been extended to measure physical sputtering from liquid lithium surfaces bombarded by D+, He+ and Li+. A Colutron ion source is used to create and accelerate gaseous or metal ions onto the liquid metal target. A plasma cup removes any oxides and saturates the surface with deuterium. A small high-temperature, HV substrate heater is used to heat the 0.76 g lithium sample past its melting point to 200 degreesC. Upon melting, a thin oxide layer is formed on the exposed lithium surface, which is cleaved by an in situ arm rotated in front of the target. Results suggest that the absolute sputtering yield of lithium is less than unity. In addition, the behavior of liquid lithium self-sputtering suggests stratification of the top liquid metal surface. This is consistent with VFTRIM-3D modeling, where D atoms migrate into the bulk while the first few monolayers remain mostly lithium. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In this environment, the samples are not directly exposed to deuterium plasma, and are exposed to high-energy particles, i.e., D and D-2 including impurity species. The deuterium amount retained was 2 x 10(17) D/cm(2) (1.3 wppm), which is only one older of magnitude larger than that found in the exposed SS304 sample. This concentration is sufficiently low not to cause the hydrogen embrittlement. A layer about 200 nm which was found to contain Ti, O, C, Fe and Cr was observed on the surface of the exposed sample. To investigate the effect of oxidation unexposed V-alloy samples were oxidized under a condition of low oxygen pressure (0.05 Pa) and low temperature (less than or equal to 723 K). After the oxidation, titanium segregation in the surface region was observed. The content of absorbed hydrogen in the oxidized sample having a thick Ti-oxide layer (greater than or equal to 100 nm) was one order of magnitude smaller than that of unoxidized sample under a given absorption condition.

Research and evaluations are underway to study the characteristics of several graphite and CFC as well as beryllium grades associated with safety, tritium release, heat transfer, thermal-mechanical and irradiation stability. Several types of graphite and CFC samples were irradiated in the high flux reactor (HFR) at different temperatures but with the same irradiation damage, while beryllium samples were irradiated in the BR2 reactor at low temperature but with a very high neutron fluence. In this paper, the result of a series of out-of-pile annealing tests aiming at investigating the tritium release kinetics after both neutron irradiation and tritium-loading from three graphite grades (i.e., A05, RGTi(91), CL5890), two DunlopCFC grades (i.e., Concept 1, Concept 2) and four SepCarbCFC grades (i.e., N312C, NS11, N112, N312B) are presented. Furthermore, the tritium and helium release behavior in a beryllium grade (i.e., S-200E produced by the Kawecki Berylco Industries is also presented. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Samples of pure porous vanadium were also tested in TEXTOR-94. This was inserted into a carbon test limiter. The test limiter was placed in the scrape-of-layer of the main toroidal ALT-II limiter. Vanadium, deuterium and carbon were measured spectroscopically. The estimated relative flux of the vanadium atoms to deuterium atoms drops from 3.8% to 0.4% with line average electron density increase from 2.5 x 10(19) to 6 x 10(19) m(-3).

In order to model the amounts of deposition, assumptions have to be made about the transport at the inner target, Analysis of divertor tiles shows that material from the main chamber travels along the SOL to the inner divertor wall, from where carbon is preferentially removed leaving a beryllium-rich film. The carbon travels to shadowed areas (such as the louvres) where deposits with high H-isotope content accrue. The analysis indicates that chemical processes must be important.

This film formation might be controlled by using a liner in the divertor pump duct to trap or transform neutral growth precursors before they deposit in remote areas of the vacuum vessel. For the understanding of film formation in such a liner the knowledge of sticking coefficients of the growth precursors is mandatory. Therefore, experiments based on the cavity technique were performed to measure surface loss probabilities of hydrocarbon radicals. In addition sticking coefficients of methyl radicals were measured directly applying well-characterized quantified radical beams. To simulate film formation in a liner, a test experiment was performed consisting of a stainless steel tube, which was exposed to a low-temperature plasma from acetylene. The Variation of the film thickness along the inner surface of this tube after plasma exposure can be described by a flux comprising of different neutral hydrocarbon radical species using the previously determined sticking coefficients. Suggestions for the control of the formation of re-deposited layers are made and a possible design of such a divertor liner is discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Deuterium and carbon emissions near a neutraliser plate (NP! of the Tore Supra Ergodic Divertor (ED) has been measured with an absolutely calibrated visible endoscope, for high- and low-density plasma regimes. From these radiation measurements, we have deduced an effective carbon flux, and at an order-of-magnitude estimate of the NP erosion: 50 m for the fall 1999 experimental ED campaign (approximate to 500 shots). Combining the measured carbon and deuterium fluxes, we deduce a global experimental carbon sputtering yield for the NP in the range 2 x-10(-2)-3 x 10(-1) for ohmic pulses, showing evidence of the importance of carbon self-sputtering, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

These issues are currently being investigated by experiments in tokamaks and in laboratories. as well as by modelling. In this study, we analyse erosion (e.g., by sputtering, ELMs, and off-normal transients) and codeposition effects in the reduced-size ITER' device, called 'ITER-FEAT, with a strike-point carbon divertor target and metallic walls, for a 'semi-detached' edge plasma regime using two-dimensional profiles of plasma edge parameters, modelled by the code B2-EIRENE. This paper accompanies the overview paper given by G. Janeschitz et al. [Plasma wall interactions in ITER-FEAT, these Proceedings]. Tritium codeposition with chemically eroded carbon still presents removal/control challenges, albeit to a somewhat lesser extent than in the 1998 ITER design, and demands efficient tritium inventory removal/control techniques. Due to numerous model uncertainties, not the least of which are the plasma solutions themselves, our intent is to provide a scoping analysis, defining trends and suggesting further research needs.

These layers will contain a significant amount of the tritium inventory of a fusion reactor. After venting brownish layers and flakes were found under the divertor structure of ASDEX Upgrade. First investigations were made on these Bakes. Due to the complicated structure beyond the divertor, shadowing effects occur indicating that the brown layers are deposited by ionised particles. The flakes were analysed using SEM and ion beam techniques. Two different types of hydrocarbon layers were found: The brownish hydrogen poor layer (D/C = 0.4) and transparent hydrogen rich layer (D/C = 1) The total amount of carbon beyond the divertor could be estimated to 1.5 g, deposited in 3000 s of plasma discharges. First measurement of the layer growth using a quartz crystal microbalance instrument is presented. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The degradation rate of mirrors bombarded long-term by keV energy range ions of deuterium plasma was found to depend strongly not only on the mirror material but also on its initial structure and energy of projectiles. The highest resistance was demonstrated by mirrors fabricated of monocrystal W and Mo and the lowest by mirrors fabricated of hot-pressed Be. As for the effect of mirror contamination, an effective reflectance was measured and calculated for some metal mirrors coated by thin films typical for existing fusion devices or for a fusion reactor: boron, carbon, and beryllium.

Measured erosion/deposition rates of the coating constituents were compared with sputtering rates calculated for pure elements. D-0-fluxes at the LTS locations were determined by the B2-EIRENE code. Over the whole liner, erosion of initial coatings by D-0 is observed. Boron erodes at a rate of 8.4 x 10(13) B cm(-2) s(-1),while silicon erodes at a rate of 5.6 x 10(13) Si cm(-2) s(-1), a factor of 1.5 lower than that of boron. With boronized walls, carbon atoms initially present in the a-C/B:D layers are eroded at a rate of 7.6 x 10(12) C cm(-2) s(-1), at the same time 1.7 x 10(12) (Fe + Cr + Ni) cm(-2) s(-1) are deposited. Compared to boronized conditions where carbon erodes, deposition of carbon (1.7 x 10(13) cm(-2) s(-1)) and of metals (3.8 x 10(12) cm(-2) s(-1) occurred during the Si campaign. Due to long time exposure at high wall temperature (350 degreesC), hydrogenic isotopes desorb; (D + H)/(B + C) and (D + H)/(Si + C) ratios degrade from originally similar to0.4 to similar to0.2.

However, such materials suffer high erosion rates during attached plasma operation which, in high power long pulse machines, would give short component lifetimes and high tritium inventories. We present the results from recent experiments in DIII-D, in which the divertor materials evaluation system (DiMES) was used to examine erosion and deposition during short exposures to well-defined plasma conditions. These studies show that during operation with detached plasmas, produced by gas injection, net erosion is suppressed everywhere in the divertor. Net deposition of carbon with deuterium was observed at the inner and outer strike points and in the private flux region between strike points, For these low temperature plasmas (T-e < 2 eV), physical sputtering is eliminated. These results show that with detached plasmas, the location of carbon net erosion and the carbon impurity source, probably lies outside the divertor. Physical or chemical sputtering by charge-exchange neutrals or ions in the main plasma chamber is a probable source of carbon under these plasma conditions, <(c)> 2001 Elsevier Science B,V, All rights reserved.

These are characterized by volume recombination, i.e. three-body and radiative recombination. Due to low T-e (few eV) hydrogen molecules can penetrate into the plasma and may play a role in divertor dynamics. In particular, it was suggested, that molecules may assist the volume recombination process. The role of molecules in the divertor is examined here by a combination of experimental results with plasma edge simulations (B2-EIRENE) and a collisional-radiative model for hydrogen molecules. Spectroscopic diagnostics of the Fulcher transition carried out at the divertor of ASDEX Upgrade yield estimates of molecular hydrogen fluxes and the vibrational population in the ground state in detached and attached hydrogen plasmas. Good agreement with B2-EIRENE is achieved only if vibrational levels are treated as distinct (metastable) particles in the model and if the collisional-radiative model is applied to the electronically excited levels. On this basis the contribution of molecules to plasma recombination was determined to be in the order of a few 10%. The dominant molecular process is the dissociation process via I-I:. As a consequence initially detached divertor plasmas can even re-attach if vibrationally resolved molecules are properly included in plasma edge models. A set of B2-EIRENE calculations carried out for ASDE)I: Upgrade is discussed. In particular the threshold upstream density for detachment was found to be up to a factor 1.5 higher than that originally expected due to these molecular effects. The transferability of the results to deuterium will be discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In the limiter tokamak TEXTOR-94 hydrogen-rich deposited layers with thicknesses up to 1 mm are observed on recessed parts of the limiters, areas perpendicular to the magnetic field in the scrape-off layer (SOL), neutralizer plates of the pumped limiter and inside the pumping ducts. In the divertor tokamak JET the main deposition is observed in the divertor, additional deposits are observed in the main chamber on the sides of the guard limiters. Codeposition of carbon ions with hydrogen is the major mechanism of layer growth at areas with direct plasma contact. At remote areas without direct plasma contact, sticking of neutral hydrocarbon radicals seems to play an important role for hydrogen trapping. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B,V. All rights reserved.

Profiles of deuterium and lattice damage in a W single crystal irradiated with 10 keV D ions at 300 K have been investigated by means of nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry combined with ion channelling techniques (RBS/C), There are at least two types of ion-induced defects which are responsible for trapping of deuterium: (i) D-2-filled microvoids (deuterium bubbles) localised in the implantation zone; and (ii) dislocations which are distributed from the surface to depths far beyond 1 mum and which capture deuterium in the form of D atoms.

Above 800 K the carbon deposition is regained. From separate experiments on magnetron sputtering of graphite by D ions, it is inferred that at 300 and 900 kinetic CHx species react at the C:D surface with the same probability. In contrast, the deposition of thermal CxHy. radicals decreases by a factor of 25 with a temperature rise from 320 to 400 K, remaining at this low level up to 1000 K. The implications of these results for co-deposition in the ITER-FEAT divertor are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Tore Supra discharges in which an apparent saturated wall, previously obtained through a succession of ohmic discharges, was transformed into a pumping wall with the application of RF heating are analyzed. Direct measurements show the increased mean energy of the CX spectrum upon application of RF heating. This leads to deeper CX neutrals penetration reaching the remaining a:C-D unsaturated layer and restoring the wall pumping efficiency. The conversion from a saturated to a pumping state with the application of RF heating, and the time scales for saturation during the ohmic and the heating phases, are reasonably well explained by several existing models. The deeper particle wall penetration observed during RF plasma experiments points to a potential mechanism which can increase tritium trapping in a fusion reactor. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

New deuterium-to-hydrogen fueling experiments in JET have been made and are compared to these previous experiments. Rates of hydrogenic species exchange are similar to those found in previous tritium experiments. granting differences in divertor configuration and mass ratio. In the new experiments, measurements of the CD and CH molecular band intensities near the divertor strike point monitor an intermediate stage of particle exchange between the plasma and wall. The CD/CH ratio correlates well with both the plasma and subdivertor concentration. The neutral transport code EIRENE and the wall hydrogen trapping and diffusion code WDIFFUSE have been used to evaluate the wall saturation. It appears that chemically-related processes play a role in mediating the plasma-wall exchange. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This model takes as input separately calculated hydrogen reemission and reflection coefficients. Model applications have successfully reproduced the core plasma transient behavior with and without density decay observed in the large helical device (LHD). Particle balance modeling has also been done for a hypothetical steady-state reactor employing carbon as the plasma-facing material. Results indicate that codeposition-induced wall pumping is quite effective in controlling the core density although, on the other hand, the tritium inventory concerns environmental safety.

The energy of D ions was well below the threshold of damage production. In a W polycrystal the deuterium spreads to a depth of about 4 mum. In contrast, no deuterium was found even at a depth of 2 mum in a W single crystal. This is an indication of significant grain boundary transport of deuterium at relatively low temperature. It has been found that similar to 10 nm thin carbon layers grown on the plasma facing surface can be a barrier for D penetration into the bulk of tungsten. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

For the former samples, a sharp intense peak and a broad weak peak appeared clearly in the spectra; the former peak was attributed to the characteristic X-rays from argon used as a working gas, and the latter peak was assigned to the bremsstrahlung X-rays from sub-surface layers of graphite. On the other hand, for the latter sample, a rather weak characteristic X-ray peak was observed along with a diminutive bremsstrahlung X-ray peak. Although the intensities of those X-rays differed from spot to spot, the tritium levels retained on the limiter tile were determined to be 58-132 Bq/cm(2). It was concluded, therefore, that valuable information on the amount and the distribution of tritium retained on/in the wall materials can be nondestructively obtained by using the BIXS.

It is observed that tritium distribution on the ALT-II tile is quite homogeneous and different from deuterium distribution and the tritium in redeposited layer is rather small, Such tritium distribution on the graphite tiles in TEXTOR behaves different compared to those in JET and TFTR where tritium was used as fueling gas or NBI injection. In JET and TFTR the tritium is part of the fuel and is co-deposited and retained in a similar manner as the deuterium. In a device like TEXTOR, the high-energy tritons are decoupled from the thermalized deuterons and show different behavior of retention; the main retention mechanism is deep implantation rather than co-deposition with eroded carbon on redeposition-dominated areas. It is also found that the tritium distribution measurements give useful new information on plasma-wall interactions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. Ail rights reserved.
