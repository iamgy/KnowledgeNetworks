The measurements were carried out in air. At 1273 K, the samples in this composition range consisted of two phases, monoclinic and cubic. Another phase, tetragonal, was observed at 1373 K. The low temperature monoclinic phase disappeared at 1473 K. It was confirmed that the monoclinic phase disappears around 1463 K; the disappearance temperature does not depend on the composition of the sample. It was, thus, inferred that there should be a eutectoid line in the phase diagram. Though the eutectoid point is not clear, the PuO(2) content at the point should be less than 3.1 mol%.

Porous features must be determined accurately for assessing the in-pile behaviour of the fuel. The analytical methodologies to measure porosities are revisited. The paper discusses in a comprehensive way the results obtained for simulated or plutonium loaded inert matrix fuel i.e. erbia and ceria or plutonia doped yttria stabilised zirconia, by applying thermodynamic or instrumental approaches. The n-D results (open/close porosities) gained by applying invasive/non-invasive, microscopic/macroscopic, neutron/photon and reflection/diffraction/transmission methods with fluid intrusion or not, are given and discussed for the zirconia based cubic solid solution.

The crystallographic structure (lattice parameters) of cubic zirconia strongly depends on the choice of the stabilizer and other dopants i.e, burnable poisons or fissile material. An extensive study of X-ray diffraction measurements was performed on zirconia samples containing different amounts of additives with the aim to observe lattice parameter and crystallite size changes in the IMF. A semiquantitative model already available in literature was used and adapted to predict the "theoretical" lattice parameters of IMF with plutonia. The results show a good agreement of theory and experiment. Furthermore, for the first time the structure of active IMF based on zirconia has been investigated and been compared to the X-ray diffraction patterns of undoped zirconia. As a consequence, it is now possible to predict lattice parameters and final densities of IMF with varying compositions, and a good control of the sample dimensions during the fabrication can be guaranteed.

The inert matrices MgAl(2)O(4) spinel and ZrO(2) are insoluble in nitric acid and are considered as good storage media for final disposal. These inert matrices will be used in this experiment, which is representative for an OTTO scenario. A total of 7 Pu-containing targets were prepared for an irradiation in the High Flux Reactor in Petten. The objective of the irradiation is to reach a very high Pu-burnup. The main parameters to be studied are stability under irradiation, swelling, fission gas release and chemical interactions in the fuel. Four targets will be equipped with thermocouples for on-line monitoring of central temperature. Four of the targets contain MgAl(2)O(4) as an inert matrix, 2 targets contain ZrO(2) and one target contains mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel for reference purposes. The fissile plutonium concentration is 0.32-0.44 g cm(-3). Both particle-dispersed fuel and homogeneous dispersions were fabricated in order to test the effect of the size of the fissile inclusions. The design of the experiment and the fabrication of the samples are discussed. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted during the implantation in order to follow the evolution of the microstructure. At an ion fluence between 2.4x10(20) to 3x10(20) m(-2) (up to 50 dpa and 4.7 at %), large Xe bubbles of 50-100 nm developed at the boundaries of the small oxide particles, while a high density of dislocation loops (up to 8 nm in diameter) and much smaller bubbles (up to similar to4 nm in diameter) formed in the spinel matrix. No large bubbles were observed at the boundaries between the spinel grains. These results suggest that the boundaries between spinel and oxide particles are preferred sites for fission gas accumulation. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Utilising and burning plutonium in a light water reactor has been shown to be feasible for the disposition of the large amount of excess plutonium produced in today's power reactors and resulting from the disarmament efforts of the super powers. With regard to material technology aspects, efforts have concentrated on the evaluation of fabrication feasibility and on the determination of the physicochemical properties of a single phase zirconium/erbium/plutonium oxide material stabilised as a cubic solution by yttrium for plutonium and minor actinide incineration and transmutation. Due to the absence of uranium as origin for plutonium build-up, such a nuclear fuel is called Inert Matrix Fuel. Irradiation testing with a dedicated experiment in the material test reactor in Halden, Norway, is underway within the framework of the OECD-Halden Reactor Project. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

According to neutronic calculations, performance differences will also arise from different evolutions of the respective radial power and burnup distributions. Modelling of these effects as well as a similar to 10% greater production of Xe in the thermal spectrum of the Halden reactor is well within the capabilities of appropriate codes. Some of the data and models used for the pre-calculations are preliminary and will be revised after the first experimental data have become available. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th Workshop on Inert Matrix Fuel, E-MRS Symposium B	MAY 30-JUN 02, 2000	STRASBOURG, FRANCE			cermet fuel; plutonium; burning; light water reactors		To complete the IMF cercer studies on the problem of Pu utilization in LWRs, a cermet fuel approach is presented. The advantages of cermet fuel are associated with high heat conductivity, ability to retain the fission products and a well-developed fabrication process. Attractive possibilities for the creation of new cermet fuels and cermet fuel elements are also presented. R&D activity aimed at the development of cermet fuel element with PuO2-Zr composite was undertaken. As a result of this activity comparative analysis of thermodynamic calculations for UO2-Zr and PuO2-Zr composites was carried out, as well as an assessment of Pu loading and preliminary thermal calculations. As a consequence, it was concluded that the PuO2-Zr cermet system could be considered as a possible variant of new cermet fuel and cermet fuel element for Pu burning in LWRs.

Researches on inert matrix materials and irradiation performance shows that the most favorable candidate for the ROX fuel is a particle dispersed fuel where small particles consisted of yttria stabilized zirconia, PuO(2) and some additives are homogeneously dispersed in spinel matrix. Reactor safety analyses show that the ROX fueled PWR core has nearly the same performability as the existing UO(2) fueled PWR under both reactivity initiated accidents and loss of coolant accidents.

The first phase of the exercise was devoted to infinite arrays of identical IMF cells. The main feature investigated in the second phase has been the influence of the neutron spectra in UO2 and MOX cores on individual IMF cells. Phase 3 is concerned with the more realistic situation of an IMF assembly surrounded by UO2 assemblies. Significant discrepancies have been observed for power peaking effects and delayed neutron parameters in Phase 2. In Phase 3, neutron balance differences for the IMF, particularly at EOL, are found to be significantly larger than were observed in Phase 1. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Cylindrical shaped samples of 150 mm in stack length and 23 mm in diameter were fabricated. The sample was contained in capsules and placed at the center of the core. Temperature of the sample was raised up to 1073 K. Measured Doppler reactivities of erbium, thorium and tungsten are comparable with those of uranium. Analysis was performed using the SRAC code system. Effective absorption cross sections of the samples were generated by two different methods. One is the f-table method based on the NR approximation and the other is the PEACO method that performs direct calculations of resonance absorption with an ultra fine energy group structure. Calculated results were compared with the measured values. For all samples except the tungsten, the f-Table method gives 1 similar to7 % smaller reactivity than the PEACO method. Both methods predict the measurements within the error of 6 %. For the tungsten sample, the calculations underestimate the measurement by about 10 %. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

As a result, the analyses have shown a very severe transient behavior of the ROX fueled PWR, which is unacceptable without any improvement. It was also found that the RIA behavior of ROX fueled PWRs can be improved by increasing the negative fuel temperature coefficient (alpha (f)). For this improvement, the additives in the ROX fuel such as UO2 and ThO2 were considered, as well as a ROX assembly partial loading UO2 core. With UO2 additive, it was successful to have satisfying alpha (f) and RIA behavior of ROX fuel core, while the partial loading core must be further improved. Besides the ROX-PWR RIA analytical study, the actual behavior of the ROX fuel pin under RIA condition has been experimentally investigated at the Nuclear Safety Research Reactor (NSRR) of JAERI. Though the ROX fuel pin failure mechanism with fuel melting seems quite different from that of UO2 pin with cladding melting, the ROX pin failure threshold was found to be roughly the same as that of UO2 in terms of accumulated energy per unit fuel volume.

The fuel rod positions were filled with 4% enriched UO2 fuel and with either reactor grade or weapons grade plutonium mixed in an inert matrix. The ratio between the UO2 and the IMF rods was varied to investigate the influence of the UO2 fuel on the dynamics of the assembly. From a simple reactor model with one delayed neutron group and first-order fuel and temperature feedback mechanisms, the linear transfer function from reactivity to reactor power was calculated that was subsequently used in a root-locus analysis. From this, it is concluded that only 20% of the fuel rods need to be made of UO2 to have a fuel that is linearly stable up to 1000 days of irradiation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The use of composite fuels in inert matrix (U-free) is a potentially efficient solution to this problem. This document deals with the cermet fuels, selected for their excellent behaviour under irradiation and their high thermal conductivity. The emphasis is placed on the study of kinetic coefficients. Comparisons are performed with other solutions that use other composite fuels, especially the Solid Solutions and ROXs. As core control requires a heterogeneous assembly, an assembly whose characteristics are compared to the APA reference is proposed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The ROX fuels failed with cladding burst at fuel volumetric enthalpies above 10 GJ m(-3), which was comparable to that of UO2 fuel. The failure of the ROX fuels, however, occurred with considerable fuel melting and was quite different to that of UO2 fuel, which was caused by cladding melting and embrittlement due to heavy oxidation. Lower fuel melting temperature of the ROX fuels compared to that of UO2 contributed to the different fuel failure modes. Certain amount of molten ROX fuel dispersed out at the failure.

However, the increase in the metallic mass, an alloy of zircaloy, in the core, as well as the composite nature of the fuel with two very different melting temperatures (similar to 1873 K for the metal, and 2573 K for the ceramic) lead to a behaviour very different from that of the traditional ceramic fuel in the event of an accident.

It concerns primarily plutonium and minor actinides (MAs), accumulated in the spent fuel of nuclear reactors. One of the ways this can be solved is to use a fast reactor with uranium-free or inert matrix fuel (IMF). The physics of this type of reactor was widely investigated during last year for BN-800 reactors. The solution of the most important problems was: a decrease in non-uniformity of power distribution and an increase of the Doppler effect. The next stage of such core investigations is an evaluation of self-protection to beyond design accidents. Preliminary results show a high safety level of BN-800 reactors with IMF in the event of unprotected loss of coolant flow (ULOF) accident. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

This heterogeneous assembly is based on the standard 17x17 geometry, replacing 144 classical UO2 fuel rods by 36 large fuel rods containing plutonium in an inert matrix. To accommodate the high power and burn-up, a thin annular geometry has been proposed. However, the design of such assembly is a challenge due to the highly innovative fuel rod concept. Regarding the fabrication, different processes are under investigation: concentric claddings with annular ceramic pellets (cercer), ceramic/metal fuel (cermet) metallurgically bonded to the claddings, vibrocompacted fuel. This paper focuses on thermomechanical studies performed for the two first concepts, in view of a future selection between the different processes. The analysis concerns temperature profiles, fuel-cladding gap evolutions and cladding buckling risk. Regarding those parameters, the conclusion is that the cermet matrix presents satisfactory conditions: operating at very low temperatures and no buckling risk. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The basic idea is founded on the manufacture of a large plutonium thin annular fuel rod with an inert support, cooled on both faces. The absence of plutonium generation, combined with moderate fuel temperature should make it possible to achieve substantial burn-up fractions in these rods. The assembly is compatible with the internals of a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR), and provides for permanent reversibility. Neutronic studies showed a compliance with actual safety/control criteria. A multi-recycling scenario was simulated for 84 years' operation with a 65 GW electrical power installed capacity, comprising forty-five 1450 MW electrical power PWRs, 32 of which are loaded with UO2 and 13 with APAs. It showed that the plutonium inventory is controlled.

In addition, the coatings of the fuel kernels made of different low and high-density ceramic layers allow a safe containment of fission products in operational, accidental and disposal conditions. Pu-based CPs embedded in a ceramic matrix (e.g. graphite, like in IFIP fuel elements) can be judged as a special cercer type. There is a wide variety of different coatings and kernel compositions that has not yet been explored beyond the HTR development. Thus it can be expected that the CP technology can be applied to other reactor systems, too. For getting full benefit of the fission product retention capability of the CPs, not only the particle design but also the core geometry as well as power densities etc, have to be adopted to each specific requirement.

Although HTR fuel main features have been established for a long time, we need today to reassess the fuel design to make sure that it meets the requirements linked to the most recent projects of High Temperature Reactors. Thus, in collaboration with Framatome and in connection with the Gas Turbine - Modular Helium Reactor (GT-MHR) international project, we are planning to perform parametric thermal add mechanical studies, regarding different particle design options (kernel diameter, layers composition and thickness) and seeking optima concerning particle leak tightness and fission product retention. But to initiate such studies, we have first of all to define the design bases and the requirements for HTR fuel, in terms of kernel composition (fissile element, oxide stoechiometry, enrichment), particle and compact geometry (dimensions, particle volume fraction in the graphite matrix), power density, cooling gas temperature and irradiation conditions (burnup, fast fluence).

Five kinds of fuels were prepared using 20% enriched U instead of Pu; a single-phase fuel of an yttria-stabilized zirconia containing UO(2) (U-YSZ), two particle-dispersed type fuels of U-YSZ particles + MgAl(2)O(4)/Al(2)O(3) powder, two homogeneously blended type fuels of U-YSZ powder + MgAl(2)O(4)/Al(2)O(3) powder. The fuels were irradiated in JRR-3 for about 100 days and estimated irradiation conditions were as follows; linear power was 15 kW m(-1), thermal neutron fluence was 7 x 10(24) m(-2) and fuel temperatures at the surface were 740-1130 K. From the results of non-destructive examinations, the stainless steel cladding surfaces were partially discolored by oxidation and no remarkable deformation of the pins was observed. Significant pellet fragmentation was not observed in spite of the crack formation as observed in irradiated LWR UO(2) fuels. Nonvolatile FPs were observed only in pellets but volatile Cs moved partly to the plenum. From these examinations, no significant difference in macroscopic irradiation behavior was distinguished among 5 fuels. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Most targets contain 20% enriched U-235 fissile inclusions with an average size of roughly 150 mum. The volume fraction of the fissile phase is either 2.5 vol% UO2 or 19.6 vol% of Y5.78UOx in the inert matrices. The samples were irradiated for 198.9 full power days in the High Flux Reactor in Petten. The calculated burn-up is between 17.3 and 19.5% FIMA. The temperature of the cladding was kept at 600 +/- 25 K. A dimensional change of at least +5 % is measured after neutron irradiation for Y3Al5O12 and MgAl2O4 with macro dispersions of UO2; the other targets with a macro dispersion of UO2 show a volume change of less than + 1 vol%. The fractional release of the fission gas Xe is more than 40% for the MgAl2O4 and Y3Al5O12 matrices with a macro dispersion of UO2, the other targets show a fractional release of Xe of less than 15%. Cracks are observed in MgO and MgAl2O4 targets which is possibly related to the stress caused by swelling of the UO2 inclusions. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

They need high enriched fuel and thus use of burnable poison. Special pellets were developed and irradiated to test such concepts. Some pellets consist of a cermet fuel. With an improved fuel thermal conductivity (by using metal matrix), lower temperatures than standard fuel are obtained. Some pellets were made of cermet and erbium in small quantity. Studies on erbium were launched to determine the influence of this neutron poison. Standard dissolutions (HNO3, HF) on cermet (Mo-UO2) and on erbium doped cermet show a large amount of insoluble matter. Tests have been carried out in order to establish a procedure for a complete dissolution of active pellets. Consequently, an optimal process was defined. Irradiated pellets from experimental reactor SILOE will be dissolved. Analytical chemistry studies were undertaken. Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry (TIMS) and Glow Discharge Mass Spectrometry (GDMS) have been applied. The U and Er isotopic composition has been determined on different samples.

In pure water the solubility of zirconia proved to be very low (about 10(-10) to 10(-8) M), while in the presence of 0.05 M NaHCO3 it increased to 10(-6)- 10(-5) M, indicating the formation of strong carbonate complexes. Due to the limited number of available data and the restricted experimental conditions (fixed pH) it was not possible to identify the stoichiometry of the complex(es). However, up to a total carbonate concentration of 0.05 M, our data are consistent with the formation of a mononuclear tetracarbonate or pentacarbonate complex. At higher carbonate concentrations basic Zr carbonates are possibly formed. The formation constant fitted for the pentacarbonate complex is at the upper limit of a range previously estimated with the help of data on analogous actinide-carbonate complexes. Although our results are not sufficient to determine reliable thermodynamic data for the complexation of Zr with carbonate, they can be used to set limits to the solubility of inert matrix spent fuel in radioactive waste storage environments. Our measurements indicate a Zr solubility in the order of 10(-6) to 10(-5) M for typical repository conditions, which is still 2-3 orders of magnitude below silica concentrations measured from the dissolution of nuclear waste glasses.

These are: plutonium burning in existing LWRs, plutonium burning in fast reactors and minor actinide transmutation - corresponding to three distinct timescales for perceived IMF implementation, viz. short, medium and long term, respectively. The current paper, based partly on the two panel discussions organised at the 6(th) IMF workshop, presents viewpoints and priorities for each of the three categories of IMF applications, both in terms of the fuel concepts to be pursued and the corresponding R&D requirements.

Therefore, materials are needed which are chemically and thermally stable over geological periods of time. The first concern addresses directly the material behavior under radiations. The radiation effect appears as an important parameter which can affect considerably the chemical durability of the solid waste forms especially for the alpha-emitter immobilization. Apatite and perovskite structures are considered with two different damage recovery processes: alpha-self-annealing and thermal recovery.

On the other hand LiNbO3:U crystals grown from melt contain uranium only as U6+. It has been recently shown that by thermal reduction the valence state can be altered to U3+/U4+. Studies on the lattice site of uranium show that U occupies exclusively the Nb site in as-grown material, while after thermal reduction at 1000degreesC for 16 h under high vacuum ca. 20% of the U atoms have been transferred to the Li site. These findings confirm the assumption that the dopant valence state is the determining factor for the impurity lattice site: dopants with valence states +1 to +4 are located on the Li site, those with valence states +5 or +6 on Nb sites.

Infrared-absorption measurements were used to monitor diffusion of deuterons and protons in alpha-Al2O3 single crystals under the application of a moderate electric field parallel to the crystallographic c-axis, in the temperature range of 973-1333 K. A linear dependence of the percent of exchange with both annealing time and applied voltage is observed, indicating that ionic conduction was taking place. The activation energy for the H+ double left right arrow D+ exchange was determined to be 2.4 eV, less than half the value obtained by pure thermal means, suggesting that under the application of an electric field the deuteron (proton) diffusion mechanism is different.

As the Samples did not provide a residual TL, a new methodology to evaluate the paleodose (P) was devised. Annual doses were evaluated based on uranium, thorium and potassium contents determined by neutron activation analysis. Preliminary ages were compared to those obtained by OSL and ages between (11-35) 10(3) BP were obtained.

Such a biomarker could significantly increase the power of epidemiological studies of individuals exposed to densely-ionising radiations Such as alpha particles (e.g. radon, plutonium workers, individuals exposed to depleted uranium) or neutrons (e.g. radiation workers, airline personnel). We discuss here a potentially powerful high LET biomarker (the H value) which is the ratio of induced interchromosomal aberrations to intra-arm aberrations. Both theoretical and experimental studies have suggested that this ratio should differ by a factor of about three between high LET radiation and any other likely clastogen, and will yield more discrimination than the previously suggested F value (ratio of inter-chromosomal aberrations to intra-chromosomal inter-arm aberrations). Evidence of the long-term stability of such chromosomal biomarkers has also been generated. Because these stable intra-arm and interchromosomal aberrations are (1) frequent and (2) measurable at lng times after exposure, this H value appears to be a practical biomarker of high LET exposure, and several in vitro studies have confirmed the approach for unstable aberrations.

The results emphasise the importance of using material-specific data rather than default reference Values for absorption into blood. The limitations of external monitoring of the chest or urine analysis are discussed, and comments made on alternative strategies for radiological protection of the worker.

However, a small intercomparison carried out in the mid-nineteen nineties raised doubts about the reliability of results obtained by methods available for measurement of thorium. An EC-funded thematic network was therefore established to bring together experts in the field of thorium analysis in order to coordinate research activity and identify best analytical practice, requirements for reference materials, etc. This network has now successfully completed its work programme, which included a survey to determine future research needs; a series of intercomparisons to test the performance of methods for measuring thorium in workplace materials, and a workshop hold to promote best practice and transfer information to regulatory authorities and industry. Results of the work have been used to make various recommendations concerning future needs in this field.

Literature surveys have shown that the majority of thorium measurements were performed using either a radiochemical technique, such as alpha or gamma spectroscopy, or ICP-MS. For many methods, there was a separation step to isolate and pre-concentrate thorium from the sample matrix. Thorium was most commonly measured in geological matrices and industrial materials. A survey of current research activity was performed through distribution of a questionnaire to laboratories and national centres. From the responses, four areas of current activity were identified: (i) development of methods, for low level thorium determination, (ii) biological monitoring and metabolism of thorium, (iii) environmental monitoring for thorium, and (iv) health risks from X ray contract media. Two key areas for priority research were identified by the thorium Thematic Network: namely sample preparation methods and for traceable standards and reference materials for thorium analysis.

Short-term decisions have to be made about acceptance limits, industrial safety as the workers are in contact with the contaminated material, and the environmental aspect regarding the disposal of the wastes. The use of gamma ray spectrometry measurements is an easy method to estimate the level of activity in materials. Under the precondition of equilibrium of activity within the thorium decay chain, which call he assumed only with knowledge of the materials' history, adequate results can be produced in a reasonable time. The advantages of gamma ray spectrometry are the low investment and operational costs, simple sample preparation, and a system that is relatively quick and easy to operate.

In this way the technique is able to provide simultaneously quantitative information (i.e. the activity) and qualitative information (the identity) on any radionuclide that emits an alpha particle. The longer-lived naturally occurring isotopes of thorium are all alpha emitters so the technique can be used to quantify them directly and this is extremely important if radiation doses due to intakes of these isotope,, into the body are to be accurately assessed. The principle of the technique is discussed, its advantages and disadvantages, and the instrumentation that is commonly used today. The need for radiochemical separation is discussed and illustrated by reference to analysis procedures in current use for thorium isotopic analysis. Practical issues such as detection limits, quality control procedures, sample throughput and cost will be covered.

J	Holmes, L				Holmes, L			Determination of thorium by ICP-MS and ICP-OES	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st European Workshop on SCK.CEN-Mol	MAR 27-28, 2001	STUDIECENTRUM, BELGIUM				PLASMA-MASS-SPECTROMETRY; ISOTOPE-DILUTION; URANIUM; ROCKS; SAMPLES	Natural thorium (Th-232) has traditionally been measured by radiometric techniques such as alpha and gamma spectrometry. However, with both ICP-OES and ICP-MS instruments becoming relatively common in many analytical laboratories, these techniques have become more acceptable in thorium analysis. This paper will briefly describe an overview of the instrumentation currently available and the techniques themselves applied to thorium analysis. Both techniques have low detection limits and require little sample treatment after the sample digestion. Routine sample analysis time is short and Spectra easy to interpret, usually giving results with low uncertainties. Whereas ICP-OES measures total thorium only, ICP-MS also offers the potential to measure other long-lived thorium isotopes (t(2) > 10(4) years), such as Th-230. However, other important isotopes, such as Th-228, are still out of reach for routine analysis, The main disadvantage of the techniques is the requirement for a sample digestion stage.

J	Kuppers, G				Kuppers, G			Determination of Th-232 by neutron activation analysis using isotope-related k(1) factors	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st European Workshop on the Analysis of Thorium in Workplace Materials	MAR 27-28, 2001	MOL, BELGIUM	CEN,SCK				Neutron activation analysis was applied to determine the Th-232 activity in different matrices. Since in nature thorium consists of almost 100% of the long-lived Th-232, the instrumental trace element analysis method of neutron activation analysis can be applied to determine the thorium content in a sample, which can then be converted into the corresponding specific activity. For the analysis about 100 mg of the sample was irradiated at a thermal neutron flux of Phi(th) = 8 x 10(13) n.cm(-2).s(-1). After irradiation the activity of the indicator nuclid Pa-233-produced by the (beta,gamma) reaction-was measured by gamma spectrometry. The content of thorium was calculated using the activation equation and the isotope-related k(i) constant. Finally, the concentration of thorium in the sample was converted into the specific activity, The activities of Th-232 measured by applying neutron activation analysis in different samples were compared with the results found by alpha spectrometry and gamma spectrometry for the daughter nuclides Ac-228 and Ra-224.

These data include half-lives, branching ratios and gamma ray emission probabilities. It is important that a common, consistent and reliable data set is used in order to minimise the potential differences between analytical results. With particular reference to the problems associated with thorium analysis, some of the various sources of nuclear data are discussed and a recommended set of data is proposed.

The comparisons were designed to move progressively from the testing of the analysis capabilities for relatively simple, aqueous solutions through to the more complex natural matrix materials encountered in the workplace. In each case, it was imperative that the comparison samples were prepared and validated in such a way as to ensure traceability of their activity values to national and international standards of radioactivity, to enable a reasonable estimate to be made of the uncertainty on those values and to ensure homogeneity both within and between samples. The processes involved are discussed.

This case, identified by the USTUR as Case 0212, had two documented intakes of plutonium and americium from occupational accidents while employed at Hanford but no known occupational exposure to thorium. Concentrations of Pu239+240, Am-241, and Th-232 in the tissues are compared and the distribution of these isotopes in this case is evaluated, The distribution data for Th-232 are compared to those from previous studies of thorium in human tissues resulting from environmental exposure and to an individual exposed to Thorotrast (colloidal ThO2) in a medical diagnostic procedure. The Th-232 distribution data from this work are also compared against ICRP 30 and ICRP 69 models for the behaviour of thorium in the human body.

Two types of ThO2 were examined to determine if the age of the material had any effect; an aged high-fired ThO2 that had its progeny in secular equilibrium, and a recently recrystallised and high-fired ThO2 in disequilibrium. The results show the amount of Th-232 that dissolved from the aged ThO2 was approximately 10 times greater than the amount that dissolved front the recrystallised and fired ThO2, which was the result of recoil damage to the crystal structure of the aged material. A model based on nuclear track theory was developed to relate the size of the observed rapidly soluble fraction or Th-232 to the age of the material and its experimentally determined surface area.
