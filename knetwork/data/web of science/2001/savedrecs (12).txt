The project focuses primarily on research on structural materials, nuclear fuel, liquid metals and associated aspects, on subcritical reactor physics and subsequently on applications such as nuclear waste transmutation, radioisotope production and safety research on subcritical systems The MYRRHA system is intended to be a multipurpose R&D facility and is expected to become a new major research infrastructure for the European partners presently involved in the ADS Demo development. Ion Beam Applications is performing the accelerator development. Currently the preliminary conceptual design of the MYRRHA system is under way and an intensive R&D programme is assessing the points of greatest risk in the present design. This work will define the final choice of characteristics of the Facility. In this paper, we will report on the status of the predesign study as of June 2000 as well as on the methods and results of the R&D programme. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

These methods are readily applicable to accelerator. and reactor, environments other than the particular model we considered and to the production of other radioactive and stable isotopes. We have also developed methods for evaluating cross sections from a wide variety of sources into a single cross section set and have produced an evaluated library covering about a third of all natural elements. These methods also are applicable to an expanded set of reactions.

We present comprehensive measurements of such data for the proton-induced production of residual nuclides from lead for proton energies between 64.8 MeV and 2.6 GeV. About 2000 individual cross-sections for 127 reactions were determined by means of off-line gamma -spectrometry. The phenomenology of excitation functions which exhibit clearly distinguishable reaction modes like multi-fragmentation, three different types of asymmetric and symmetric fission and deep spallation is discussed. The experimental data are compared with calculations based on an intranuclear cascade/evaporation model in form of the LAHET code system. Together with earlier model exercises this comparison demonstrates the necessity for further improvements of models and codes if medium-energy activation cross-sections for applications shall be reliably predicted by theory. Today, experimental investigations remain indispensable. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A stochastic nonlinear model and parameter identification	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							WASTE-DISPOSAL; DISPERSION; MIGRATION; PLUTONIUM; AQUIFERS; SITE	In this paper we present an extension of a stochastic model of groundwater contaminant transport, previously proposed by the authors, to account for the presence of colloids in the system, These have been shown experimentally to facilitate significantly the transport of contaminants. The stochastic model is based on the Kolmogorov-Dmitriev theory of branching stochastic processes and is capable of explicitly accounting for the individual interactions, possibly nonlinear and not at equilibrium. which occur during the transport process. We tackle the problem by means of a Monte Carlo method properly devised to account for the nonlinearities introduced by the presence of colloids. For the determination of the model parameters an approach is followed which is based on a comparison of the stochastic model equations with those of the classical advection-dispersion one. This has enabled us to establish relationships which link the transition rates to the classically measurable quantities, (C) 2001 Elsevier science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wahid, PA				Wahid, PA			Radioisotope studies of root activity and root-level interactions in tree-based production systems: a review	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Review							COMPETITION; PHOSPHORUS; KERALA; INDIA; P-32	This review focuses on the radioisotope methods used for studying the root activity patterns of woody perennials and root competition in multi-species cropping systems. 32P soil-injection is by far the most widely used method. The method is unique as it enables one to delineate the lateral and vertical spread of the absorbing roots. A system of classification of crop plants based on the concept of 'effective foraging space' has been developed. The scope and applicability of the radioisotope methods in different cropping situations as well as from the point of view of radiological safety were discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The oxidative character of iodogen is not clear, but the two carbonyl groups in its structure probably have an essential role in its oxidizing character. In this study, the self-radioiodination of iodogen has been examined. It was observed that about 10-20% of the initial iodine radioactivity was consumed for the self-radioiodination of iodogen itself. On the other hand, the radioiodinated iodogen removed by ethyl alcohol from the iodogen-coated tubes showed clearly that no thyroid uptake was observed and that it was rapidly cleared out from the whole body of a rabbit administered with the radioiodinated iodogen by injection via the ear vein.

J	Helmeke, HJ; Harms, T; Knapp, WH				Helmeke, HJ; Harms, T; Knapp, WH			A water target with beam sweep for routine fluorine-18 production	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						water target; fluorine-18; FDG; PET	F-18	Fluorine-18 (F-18) production with O-18-enriched water targets is well established world-wide. Heat transfer is still a critical point, however, when high beam currents are used to increase the amount of radioactivity per batch within an adequate irradiation period. The technique of beam sweep formerly used in Hannover for all targets has been adapted for this water target again. A titanium target with a beam sweep of up to 3 cm in the horizontal plane was designed to keep the total amount of enriched water low (2.06 ml), to allow beam currents of 30 muA for 1 h on a daily schedule and thereby to extend maintenance periods to more than 6 months. The design had to take into account that the target must be mounted on a target ladder with five additional positions and that the beam is carried by a 5.50m beam line from a variable energy, multi-particle cyclotron (mc35, Scanditronix) to the target. The target has been in use for more than 130 consecutive runs with beam currents of about 30 muA at a target pressure of up to 15 bar without any maintenance. The mean value of the recovered radioactivity has reached 91.9 +/- 7.7% of the theoretically expected value at the end of bombardment(EOB). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

For two different measuring geometries and an HPGe detector, calculated and experimental correction factors have been shown to closely agree for Eu-152. The simulation method has subsequently been applied in assessing the need for coincidence-summing corrections for members of the uranium, thorium and actinium series measurable by gamma -spectrometry. Correction factors were calculated for predominant gamma emissions significantly affected by coincidence-summing effects and the correctness of our calculations tested for environmental samples. The test makes it evident that in order to obtain reliable and unbiased activity values for some natural radionuclides coincidence summing cannot be neglected in environmental measurements at small source-detector distances.

It allows emission probabilities to be calculated for K and L X-rays following radioactive disintegration processes. This program was already applied to the calculation of total K X-ray emission probabilities for six radionuclides. The results are found to be in reasonable agreement with measured values. In order to check the validity of this program also for the individual components of K and L X-rays, calculated emission probabilities of K X-ray components (Ce-139, Hg-203) and L X-ray components (Ce-139, Hg-203, Am-241) were compared with remeasured (Ce-139, Hg-203) and already available (Am-241) emission probabilities, measured earlier at the PTB. In most cases there is an agreement within the standard uncertainties of the measured and calculated values, usually within 1-5%. Larger deviations, not covered by three times the standard uncertainty have been found for some weak lines. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, TK; Wang, MY; Ko, FH; Tseng, CL				Wang, TK; Wang, MY; Ko, FH; Tseng, CL			Characterization and modeling of the metal diffusion from deep ultraviolet photoresist and silicon-based substrate	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						DUV photoresist; impurity diffusion; radioactive tracer technique; out-diffusion cleaning model; cleaning coefficient	SI-WAFER; CONTAMINATION; IMPURITIES; REMOVAL; IMPACT; SEGREGATION; INTERFACE; IRON	The radioactive tracer technique was applied to investigate the out-diffusion of the transition metals (Cu, Fe and Co) from deep ultraviolet (DUV) photoresist into underlying substrate. Two important process parameters, viz., baking temperatures and substrate types (i.e., bare silicon, polysilicon, silicon oxide and silicon nitride), were evaluated. Results indicate that the out-diffusion of Co is insignificant, irrespective of the substrate type and baking temperature. The Out diffusion of Cu is significant for substrates of bare silicon and polysilicon but not for silicon oxide and nitride; for Fe, the story is reversed. The substrate type appears to strongly affect the diffusion, while the baking temperature does not. Also, the effect of solvent evaporation was found to play an important role in impurity diffusion. Using the method of numerical analysis, a diffusion profile was depicted in this work to describe the out-diffusion of metallic impurities from photoresist layer under Various baking conditions. In addition, the effectiveness of various wet-cleaning recipes in removing metallic impurities such as Cu, Fe and Co was also studied using the radioactive tracer technique. Among the six cleaning solutions studied, SC2 and SPM are the most effective in impurity removal. An out-diffusion cleaning model was first proposed to describe the cleaning process.

For data acquisition a high-purity germanium detector (HPGe) was used. The range of the total specific activity (minimum and maximum values) due to all the three radionuclides (K-40, Ra-226 and Th-232) were found to be 187.8 +/- 63.5-573.2 +/- 73.1 Bq kg(-1) (Portland cement); 54.5 +/- 16.1-183.9 +/- 31.4 Bq kg(-1) (limestone); 87.1 +/- 30.7-297.1 +/- 64.4 Bqkg(-1) (gypsum); 696.4 +/- 79.1-1043.9 +/- 85.0 Bqkg(-1) (slate); and 490.9 +/- 54.5-570.2 +/- 59.8 Bqkg(-1) (latrite). The average specific activities due to K-40 in Portland cement and all the raw materials were found to be higher when compared with Ra-226 and Th-232. Such materials do not pose any excess radiological health problem. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Degtyarev, AM; Myasnikov, AA				Degtyarev, AM; Myasnikov, AA			The stability of the neutron field of the conversion load of commercial uranium-graphite reactors with respect to high-frequency oscillations	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The stability of the neutron field in a conversion load of commercial uranium-graphite reactors on the basis of highly enriched uranium in connection with the intrinsic positive reactivity effect with respect to fuel temperature is studied This effect is small compared with the negative reactivity effect with respect to the coolant temperature, but nonetheless this feature creates the prerequisites for the appearance of neutron-physical instability during reactor operation and requires a corresponding study. The analysis was based on the computational investigation of the behavior of simplified one-point and one-dimensional models of the core in transient regimes with a mutually consistent description of the dynamics of the neutron- and thermophysical properties of the load. The basic assumptions concerning the characteristics of the reactor which were used in the computational model are presented. The results obtained, on the basis of the approximations adopted, preclude the possibility of the appearance of spontaneous high-frequency oscillations, due to positive effect of reactivity with respect to fuel temperature, in the conversion load.

J	Lenail, B				Lenail, B			Spent nuclear fuel transport to La Hague reprocessing plant	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			English	Article								In May 1998, transports of spent fuel elements were discontinued temporarily in France, Germany, Switzerland, and Belgium after discoveries of increased loose radioactive contamination of shipping casks. In no case did the contamination constitute a hazard, also because the standard upper limit of 4 Bq/cm(2) has been chosen extremely conservatively. To avoid the recurrence of such events, a catalog of technical measures was elaborated jointly by industry, public authorities, and expert consultant organizations and has since been applied successfully. As a consequence, transports of spent nuclear fuel elements to La Hague can be licensed again in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands since 1998. 894 shipments to La Hague showed deviations in only few of cases, thanks to the measures initiated; the rate of occurrence is decreasing, and the levels of contamination have become lower in each case. The late resumption of transports between Germany and France is not due to technical reasons or particularly frequent, high contamination cases prior to 1998, but is a consequence of the particularly sensitive environment of the use of nuclear power in Germany.

J	Sailer, M				Sailer, M			The new RSK guidelines for interim stores	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								in view of the impending licensing procedures for interim stores of spent fuel elements, the German Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (RSK) analyzed and discussed former and current licensing procedures. As a consequence, it was decided in August 2000 to draft guidelines for interim storage in order to make available unambiguous technical rules and regulations to cover all processes. They were adopted by RSK in March 2001 as "Technical Safety Guidelines for Dry Interim Cask Storage of Spent Fuel Elements." The,guidelines apply to the dry interim storage of any kind of spent fuel element in interim stores on site and in other places in type B(U) packages qualified with respect to transport and also with respect to long-term issues. The fundamental safety requirements covered are the safe containment of radioactive substances, mechanical integrity of the fuel element structure, a repair concept, criticality safety, heat removal, and radiation protection. In addition, the guidelines also refer to abnormal operating conditions essentially comprising external impacts - in analogy to the requirements applying to other, existing nuclear facilities, such as storm, stroke of lightning, flood, earthquake, airplane crash, shock waves. In addition, matters of infrastructure are covered with respect to a potential connection to, or common use of, on-site facilities. Accordingly, this body of rules contains all requirements to be met by interim stores so as to achieve maximum safety of the installation and, at the same time, reliability in application in licensing procedures.

Planning by the STEAG encotec GmbH/ Nordostschweizerische Kraftwerke AG (NOK) consortium of the "interim storage building and planning of the entire installation" subproject began in 1991; construction work was started in the mid-nineties. "Cold" commissioning of the buildings and installations, together with acceptance tests and delivery to the client, ZWILAG, have meanwhile been completed successfully; "hot" commissioning is expected to be carried out this year. As a next step, ZWILAG decided to build a store for low and medium-level radioactive waste and awarded the contract to the NOK/STEAG/ CPE consortium. The part of ZWILAG described in this article mainly comprises the storage of medium-level waste generating heat in the so-called MLW store. Building the MLW store within the framework of ZWILAG marks the implementation of a concept proven in operation which meets all requirements of long-term storage of the waste specified.

J	Stratmann, W; Wortmann, B				Stratmann, W; Wortmann, B			Technical design of on-site interim stores	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								The direct disposal of spent fuel elements provided for in the German Atomic Energy Act must be preceded by a period of interim storage to reduce the activity inventory. As a consequence of limited capacities of the in-plant spent fuel storage pools, additional interim storage capacity needs to be created. In Germany, dry interim storage of fuel elements in suitable casks is the preferred technique. An on-site interim storage concept meeting these requirements has been developed by STEAG and is described in this article. On-site interim stores must meet a number of criteria both with respect to their conceptual design aspects and with regard to the protection they must offer against accidents and external impacts. In addition, site-specific factors impose other boundary conditions affecting planning. Important factors, such as thermal output, dose rate, and positioning pattern, are a function of the CASTOR(C) V/19 and CASTOR(C) V/52 type casks available for storage. On the basis of these data it is possible, by employing the most recent computing tools, to design interim stores to the state of the art with respect to external shielding of the storage building, heat removal from the building, and cask temperatures. The results demonstrate that the most important design objective, i.e., meeting the goals of protection, is being attained.

J	Petroll, M				Petroll, M			USA: Energy policy and spent fuel and waste management	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								The new US administration under President Bush has shifted political weights in the country's energy policy. The policy pursued by the Clinton administration, which had been focused strongly on energy efficiency and environmental protection, will be revoked in a number of points, and the focus instead will now be on economics and continuity of supply, also against the backdrop of the current power supply crisis in California. However, it is more likely that fossil-fired generating capacity will be expanded or added than new nuclear generating capacity. As far as the policy of managing radioactive waste is concerned, no fast and fundamental changes are expected. Low-level waste arising in medicine, research, industry, and nuclear power plants will be stored in a number of shallow ground burial facilities also involving more than one federal state. The Yucca Mountain repository project will be advanced with a higher budget, and WIPP (Waste Isolation Plant) in the state of New Mexico has been in operation since 1998. Plans for the management of spent fuel elements include interim stores called ISFSIs (Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations) both near and independent of nuclear power plant sites. Nineteen sites have been licensed, another eighteen are ready to be licensed. In addition, also international spent fuel and nuclear waste management approaches are being discussed in the United States which, inter alia, are meant to offer comprehensive solutions to countries running only a small number of nuclear power plants.

J	Sawan, ME; Malang, S				Sawan, ME; Malang, S			Neutronics features of a high power density first wall/blanket with lithium evaporation cooling	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						neurtronics; power density; lithium		Two-dimensional neutronics analysis has been performed for the Evaporation of Lithium and Vapor Extraction (EVOLVE) FW/blanket concept. The concept utilizes a refractory alloy (W-5Re) structure. The overall tritium breeding ratio is 1.37 at a lithium enrichment of 40% Li-6. The amount of nuclear heat deposited in the different regions was determined. About 76% of the total thermal energy is carried by the Li vapor to the heat exchanger. Since this heat is extracted at a temperature of 1200 degreesC, a power conversion efficiency > 60% can be achieved.

It offers safety advantages arising from its low induced radioactivity and afterheat, and the possibility of high performance through high temperature operation. However, its behavior and performance at high temperatures and under irradiation are still not well known and need to be better characterized. This paper summarizes the current SiCf/SiC design and R&D status. The latest SiCf/SiC-based power core design studies are summarized, and the key SiCf/SiC parameters affecting the performance of power core components are highlighted. The current status of the material R&D is discussed, with the focus on fabrication and joining, baseline properties and properties under irradiation, as well as the desirable evolution of these properties. In the light of this, the R&D plans are summarized and assessed. Finally, to help present-day design studies and in the expectation of future confirmatory R&D results, recommendations are provided on SiCf/SiC parameters and properties to be assumed for present design analysis of long term SiCf/SiC-based power plants.

An experimental device consisting of a 45-cm-diam, 31-cm-high stainless steel cylindrical chamber was constructed in which a spherical mesh-type 30-cm-diam anode was installed. A spherical grid cathode made of 1.2-mm-diam stainless steel wire was made into a 7-cm-diam open spherical grid. The system was maintained at a constant pressure of 1 to 15 mTorr by feeding hydrogen or deuterium gas. The visible and ultraviolet emissions from the device were measured using the spectroscopic method. Strong emission lines of hydrogen were observed, and all hydrogen lines were broadened, remarkably, by Doppler and/or Stark effects. From these data, beam ion velocity, electron density and temperature of the core plasma were estimated Using deuterium gas, a steady-state neutron production rate of 10(4) s(-1) was observed at a discharge of 40 kV; 2 mA. In the low-current region of several milliamperes, the neutron production rate was proportional to the discharge current to the power from similar to1.1 to 1.4. The beam-background reactions were dominant in the measured range of voltage and current.

Some unpublished data from personal communications also have been used to present the time evolution of the studies. The radiological impact in Greece of the Chernobyl:l accident is examined in two separate phases: that of the acute effects and that of the delayed effects. Some measurements cover the whole period from the accidental pollution to the return to pre-accident levels and are used for estimations of ecological half-lives. The composition of radioactive fallout is examined, and the integrated concentrations of the principal radionuclides in the fallout are presented, The variations in the air concentrations of certain radionuclides and those of the gamma-ray intensity are presented as well. Some results from the study of hot particles detected during the acute phase are also given. The radioactive contamination of abiotic environmental components, food, and crops during the acute and the delayed effects phases are discussed in relation to the radiological impact on the population.

J	Grogan, HA; Sinclair, WK; Voilleque, PG				Grogan, HA; Sinclair, WK; Voilleque, PG			Risks of fatal cancer from inhalation of (239,240)plutonium by humans: A combined four-method approach with uncertainty evaluation	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						cancer; inhalation; Pu-239; Pu-240	DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIPS; THOROTRAST PATIENTS; LUNG-CANCER; PLUTONIUM DIOXIDE; LIVER-CANCER; WORKERS; RADIATION; PU-239; MORTALITY; LEUKEMIA	The risk per unit dose to the four primary cancer sites for plutonium inhalation exposure (lung, liver, bone, bone marrow) is estimated by combining the risk estimates that are derived from four independent approaches. Each approach represents a fundamentally different source of data from which plutonium risk estimates can be derived, These are: (1) epidemiologic studies of workers exposed to plutonium; (2) epidemiologic studies of persons exposed to low-LET radiation combined with a factor for the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of plutonium alpha particles appropriate for each cancer site of concern; (3) epidemiologic studies of persons exposed to alpha-emitting radionuclides other than plutonium; and (4) controlled studies of animals exposed to plutonium and other alpha-emitting radionuclides extrapolated to humans. This procedure yielded the following organ-specific estimates of the distribution of mortality risk per unit dose from exposure to plutonium expressed as the median estimate with the 5(th) to 95(th) percentiles of the distribution in parentheses: lung 0.13 Gy(-1) (0,022-0,53 Gy(-1)); liver 0.057 Gy(-1) (0.011-0.47 Gy(-1)); bone 0.0013 Gy(-1) (0.000060-0.025 Gy(-1)); bone marrow (leukemia), 0.013 Gy(-1) (0.00061-0.05 Gy(-1)). Because the different tissues do not receive the same dose following an inhalation exposure, the mortality risk per unit intake of activity via inhalation of a 1-mum AMAD plutonium aerosol also was determined. To do this, inhalation dose coefficients based on the most recent ICRP models and accounting for input parameter uncertainties were combined with the risk coefficients described above. The following estimates of the distribution of mortality risk per unit intake were determined for a 1-mum AMAD plutonium aerosol with a geometric standard deviation of 2,5: lung 5.3 x 10(-7) Bq(-1) (0.65-35 x 10(-7) Bq(-1)), liver 1.2 x 10(-7) Bq(-1) (0.091-20 x 10(-7) Bq(-1)), bone 0.11 x 10(-7) Bq(-1) (0,0030-4,3 x 10(-7) Bq(-1)), bone marrow (leukemia) 0.049 x 10(-7) Bq(-1) (0.0017-0.59 x 10(-7) Bq(-1)). The cancer mortality risk for all sites was estimated to be 10 x 10(-7) Bq(-1) (2.1-55 x 10(-7) Bq(-1))-a result that agrees very well with other recent estimates. The large uncertainties in the risks per unit intake of activity reflect the combined uncertainty in the dose and risk coefficients.

The external gamma absorbed dose rates prevailing in the region were measured using a portable plastic scintillometer, Soil samples from 18 stations were collected from depth intervals of 0-5, 5-10, and 10-25 cm and analyzed for their Ra-226, Th-232, and K-40 activity concentrations by gamma spectrometry employing a 90 cc PGT HpGe detector coupled to an EG&G ORTEC 8K: multichannel analyzer, The activity of Ra-226 was found to vary between 15.5-61.2 Bq kg(-1) with a mean value of 31.3 Bq kg(-1), that of Th-232 varies between 11.4-41.9 Bq kg(-1) with a mean value of 27.5 Bq kg(-1) and of 40K between 78.3-255.8 Bq kg(-1) with a mean value of 159.9 Bq kg(-1) in 0-5 cm soil profiles of the region. The contributions of U-238, Th-232, and K-40 to the total gamma absorbed dose rate were 39.9%, 40.7%, and 16.0%, respectively. The gamma absorbed dose rate in air estimated using the results of activity concentration of Ra-226, Th-232, and K-40 are found to compare well with that of the direct measurement, The results of the study were compared with the literature values reported for other environs of the country as well as the world, and conclusions are drawn.

In 1990-1991 the rt actor was redesigned, partially decommissioned and recommissioned to operate with Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) fuel at a thermal power of 10 MW. An essential requirement, construction and commissioning of a wet spent fuel storage bay and fabrication of an irradiated fuel transfer cask were completed before actual dismantling of the reactor core. During the partial decommissioning operations, radioactive waste generated included 600 m(1) low-level liquid radioactive waste and 14 m(3) of solid radioactive waste with an average specific activity of 4.52 Bq ml(-1) anti 2.22 kBq g(-1), respectively. External radiation doses of the workers were determined rising TLD (NG 6,7) and direct reading dosimeters. Tire maximum individual external radiation dose received by any worker during this practice was 5 mSv, which was 25% of the annual dose limit of 20 mSv. Detection and measurement of internal contamination was carried out using bioassay techniques. During the whole operation, not a single case of internal contamination was detected. The ambient radiation levels around waste seepage pits are periodically monitored using TLD (G-2 cards) and G. M. radiation survey meters. Underground migration of radioactivity is checked by analyzing seepage water samples taken from boreholes that have been dug at different locations in tire vicinity of the radioactive residues. The monitoring around disposal sites containing radioactive residues has been continued during the last 9 gamma and will be continued in the future. So far, no rise in the environmental gamma radiation dose level and migration of underground radionuclides has been found in the vicinity of these disposal sites. Working personal during the decommissioning of PARR-I have been found to be radiologically safe. Adherence to the ALARA principle, sound decommissioning min proper radioactive waste disposal procedures helped to protect the working personnel, members of the public, and the environment from the harmful effects of the ionizing radiations present due to tire partial decommissioning of the research reactor and its radioactive residues. Experience gained during this work, along with the current international procedures, will be helpful for full restoration of the environment from radioactive residues likely to be generated in the future from any other practices in Pakistan.

This report documents the variability in results of swipes carried out on various metal surfaces and the variability between different experienced health physics technicians. Also, there is an issue of the efficiency of the first swipe in terms of what fraction of the total absorbed surface contamination is detected by a swipe. The samples toed for this study were metal surfaces uniformly exposed in tilt spent fuel pool of a nuclear power plant. The primary surfaces studied were those usually found on spent fuel transportation casks (mainly 304 stainless steel in the U.S.), which are submerged in the spent fuel pools for loading or unloading of the highly rodioactive fuel assemblies from nuclear power plants. These surfaces become contaminated with suspended and dissolved radionuclides, primarily Cs-137, Cs-134, and Co-60, in the spent fuel pool. A detailed evaluation was conducted of variations in the swipe measurements made on these metal samples using repeated swipes of the same area by the same technician and comparing swipes of one technician to those of another on similar surfaces. Rough surface finishes showed considerable inconsistency (approximately 30% variation) from one technician to another, but smooth surface finishes show substantially better consistency (<10% variation) between technicians. Tile "efficiencies" of a single swipe, particularly the initial swipe, expressed as a fraction of total "removable" contamination, ranged from approximately 10% to 20% for the stainless steel and titanium surfaces. Aluminum surfaces, on the other hand showed much higher efficiencies on the initial swipe. However in terms of the total contamination imbedded in the surfaces, The first swipe picked up only between 0.5% and 3% of the total adsorbed contamination. The overall results show the wide variations that routinely occur in swipe results on portions of surfaces that would be expected to give consistent results. These difference are an order of magnitude or more greater than the counting statistical errors.

One possible step in This process is the scanning of land to locate elevated areas of radiological contamination. By adapting existing global positioning technology with radiation detection systems, this process can be significantly accelerated. The Field Instrument for Detecting Low Energy Radiation (FIDLER) was used in conjunction with a Global Positioning System (GPS) and Trimble(R) data logger. With this system two different land areas were scanned using Two different scanning methods. In the first method, three FIDLERs were attached to a baby jogger and were used to scan a 20-acre site devoid of vegetation. The second technique involved individuals carrying The instruments over a 15-acre site that contained vegetation. Here tile FIDLERs were waved in front of the workers in 50-cm arcs. In all cases, radiological and position data were collected by the data loggers, Using these results, accurate maps were generated for each sire clearly illustrating areas and spots of elevated activity. By employing this technique over 250,000 data points pertaining to position and count rate were used to map nearly 40 acres of land in under 3 wk.

J	Ryan, MT; Skrable, KW; French, CS; Potter, CA				Ryan, MT; Skrable, KW; French, CS; Potter, CA			A simple method for assessing exposure to internal emitters	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topics; exposure, internal; alpha particles; intake, radionuclide	CLEARANCE	One of The most challenging aspects of regulatory compliance can be demonstrating compliance with internal dosimetry requirements. For long-lived alpha-emitting radionuclides in particular, the sensitivity and accuracy of bioassay analysis and whole body counting may not allow for adequate assessment of intakes. Simple and effective measures can be used to control the workplace for the internal hazards associated with long-lived radioactive material using methods that measure directly the air to which workers are exposed. This paper provides an easy assessment tool that uses direct measurement of the specific activity of dusts in breathing zone air to evaluate internal exposures. Using this method sensitive assessments can be made to determine if intakes are likely to have occurred and, if so, at what magnitude. It is not a substitute for confirmatory bioassay or whole body counting but a simple method To evaluate expectations for internal exposures.

J	Lee, KW; Kim, SK; Kim, KT; Hong, SI				Lee, KW; Kim, SK; Kim, KT; Hong, SI			Ductility and strain rate sensitivity of Zircaloy-4 nuclear fuel claddings	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							DISLOCATION SUBSTRUCTURE; DEFORMATION; BEHAVIOR; ALLOYS	The circumferential mechanical properties of nuclear fuel claddings for Canada deuterium uranium (CANDU) power reactors were examined and the constitutive equation which can predict the temperature dependence of ductility and strain rate sensitivity was developed. The loss of ductility associated with dynamic strain aging was observed between 250 degreesC and 400 degreesC. The elongation minimum results from the concentration of deformation in the necked region in the temperature range of the flow stress plateau. Oxygen atoms actually strengthen the alloy. However, the strengthening of the alloy due to dynamic strain aging decreases the strain rate sensitivity in the temperature range of the flow stress plateau. The decrease in the strain rate sensitivity results in a low ductility. Above the temperature range of the flow stress plateau the elongation of the alloy increases rapidly with temperature. The prediction based on a dynamic strain aging model is in good agreement with the temperature dependence of the circumferential ductility of Zircaloy-4, nuclear fuel claddings.

J	Alam, M; Inal, MY				Alam, M; Inal, MY			Permeation behavior of deuterium implanted in electro- and sputter-deposited copper coatings on aluminum alloy substrates	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							RETENTION; TRITIUM; RELEASE	Permeation behavior of deuterium in copper coatings (similar to6 mum thickness) deposited on A1-6061 substrates by the electro- and the sputter-deposition methods is compared. The electroplated coating contained copper and aluminum phases, and exhibited microcracks that were distributed uniformly all over the surface. The sputtered coating contained Cu9Al4 and CuAl2 phases in addition to copper and aluminum, and was fairly dense. Both the coatings contained oxygen at the free surface and at the coating-substrate interface. Deuterium was implanted in both the coatings under identical conditions and the deuterium profiles were subsequently measured using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). In case of the electroplated coating, the implanted deuterium diffused into the sample without any interference and reached the oxygen-rich interface where it was trapped by the aluminum oxide. On the contrary, in case of the sputtered coating, the diffusing deuterium was trapped continuously before reaching the oxygen-rich coating-substrate interface. The results are discussed.

The study was performed in the 673 to 1073 K temperature range and with driving pressures from 1.3 x 10(4) to 10(5) Pa. The characteristic protium oscillation temperatures in the ground state theta = 893 K and in the excited state theta* = 2467 K were calculated using the approximation of the ideal harmonic vibration of hydrogen isotope atoms in a unique type of solution site. The extrapolated tritium transport parameters obtained using these oscillation temperatures were: D (m(2) s(-1)) = 5.34 x 10(=10)exp(-11.2/RT), K-s (mol m(-3) Pa-1/2) = 2.25 x 10(-2)exp(-27.8/RT), Phi (mol m(-1) Pa-1/2 s(-1)) = 1.20 x 10(-11)exp(-3.9/RT), E-t (kJ mol(-1)) = 100.5, N-t (sites m(-3)) = 2.3 x 10(23).

J	Bourgeois, L; Dehaudt, P; Lemaignan, C; Fredric, JP				Bourgeois, L; Dehaudt, P; Lemaignan, C; Fredric, JP			Pore migration in UO2 and grain growth kinetics	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							TRACER SURFACE-DIFFUSION; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; SINTERED UO2; COMPUTER-SIMULATION; POROUS COMPACTS; 2 DIMENSIONS; PELLETS; IRRADIATION; ENERGY; SIZE	Grain growth and density increase of UO2 has been measured during annealings at temperatures between 1650 degreesC and 1750 degreesC, for up to 300 h. The results have been compared to what can be deduced from a review of grain growth kinetics for undoped uranium dioxide. Although much theoretical and experimental work has been devoted to this topic, the mechanism controlling grain boundary migration cannot be clearly identified on the basis of available data. Since grain growth kinetics cannot be separated from pore migration, pore migration rates have been calculated using existing data for UO2 mass transport. In the temperature and pore size ranges investigated, it seems that surface diffusion is a more efficient mechanism for pore migration than evaporation-condensation (EC), although these results are strongly dependent on the reliability of the surface diffusion data.

J	Rauh, H; Ullmaier, H				Rauh, H; Ullmaier, H			Hydrogen concentrations near cracks in target materials for high-power spallation neutron sources	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							POINT-DEFECTS; DIFFUSION; DEUTERIUM; STEEL; IRON; NB; IRRADIATION; PERMEATION; SOLUBILITY; ADSORPTION	Materials in the target region of spallation neutron sources which are exposed, or are close to the proton beam suffer from high rates of displacement damage and the production of foreign elements, particularly hydrogen and helium isotopes. Whilst some results on the effect of helium are now available, there is little information on the potential influence of hydrogen in the environment of a spallation source. We therefore investigate theoretically the establishment of hydrogen background concentrations and their enhancement near microcracks in proton-irradiated plates of ferritic/ martensitic steel and tantalum, respectively, for the conditions of the envisaged 5 MW European Spallation Source (ESS). A comparison of the predicted hydrogen concentrations with empirical threshold concentrations for hydrogen embrittlement and hydride formation indicates that the use of ferritic/martensitic steels for water-cooled windows may be problematic, although these materials remain good candidates for the mercury container. Tantalum as a prospective material for the solid target option of ESS is not expected to undergo hydrogen degradation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

An instantaneous power peaking factor (IPF) for cores with various compositions was evaluated using thermal neutron flux obtained from TEE and burnup calculations, to characterize the time variation in the power distribution caused by the injections of pulsed fast neutrons. It was shown that the shorter generation times due to the larger values of the effective fission cross section for the cores containing plutonium than the cores without plutonium cause the larger values of IPF in most cases of the injections of pulsed fast neutrons of 3 and 0.15 ms pulse widths, it was also shown that the exceptions in the case of 0.15 ms pulse width that the values of IPF are larger for the cures without plutonium than the cores containing plutonium are ascribed to the changes in effective fission cross section caused by the instantaneous hardening of thermal neutron spectrum at the pulsed source position.

For some classes of soil, various measurement instruments can be inserted to depths of 100 feet or more using the cone penetrometer technique. The problems for gamma-ray spectroscopy in this application include size limitations, elevated and/or variable temperature environment vibration and shock, and remote operation. Measurement of gamma-ray spectra under these conditions has been done using scintillation detectors such as NaI(Tl) or EGO. However, these instruments suffer from poor energy resolution (ca. 8-10%), temperature sensitivity and, in the case of NaI(Tl), activation by neutrons. Sentor Technologies, Inc., working under Department of Energy sponsorship and in conjunction with Virginia Commonwealth University and the University of California, San Diego, has developed a high-pressure xenon ionization chamber spectrometer that is specifically designed for use in cone penetrometers. Key features of the detector design include a 29 mm O.D. cylindrical geometry with concentric cathode, Frisch grid, and anode, and ultra-purified (ca ppb) xenon pressurized to a density of 0.6 g(.)cm(-3). The results demonstrate the utility of high-pressure xenon ionization spectrometers for field use in cone penetrometers or similar applications including borehole logging.

The measured spectra were accurately analyzed by HYPERMET-PC. Prompt gamma -ray energies and associated gamma -ray production cross-sections have been determined by internal standardization. The resulting catalog contains prompt gamma -ray data from neutron capture and other reactions such as (n,alpha), and decay gamma -ray data from short-lived reaction products. Data have been measured for nearly all stable elements, from hydrogen to uranium. Generally, data for several isotopes are given, to enable isotopic analysis as well. The whole library, including elemental spectra, will be available as a book.

A PSL system with 25 mum pixel digitization has been applied to particle analysis problems, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Two data evaluation methods are currently employed: (1) bulk area signal measurement, and (2) discrete event counting which may include spectral evaluation. The first method is conventional, whereas the second method requires high spatial resolution and is presented here for the first time. The counting methods can discriminate between alpha and background counts. The unshielded background signal accumulation rate was determined by the bulk area method. Using the spectral method of evaluation for a-particle events, the mean signal intensity per recorded a-particle was measured, and the detective quantum efficiency (DQE) was found to be nominally 100%. We present a comparison to gamma-spectrometry for sub-Bq Cs-137 activities, and demonstrate an application for the qualitative assay of International Atomic Energy Agency swipe samples collected from uranium enrichment facilities.

Converting this unique research tool designed to support nuclear weapons testing to a quasi-production mode for the routine analysis of similar to 300 urine samples/year for ultra-low levels of plutonium has required resolution of numerous practical issues. These issues include clean-room sample preparation, adequate tracer recovery, customer specified turn-around times, throughput, water and urine blank values, statistical data reduction, and quality control and performance evaluation sample requirements.

We report herein preliminary efforts to extend the principles developed for ion-specific chelating ligands to the weaker, more diffuse electrostatic interactions between complex anions and dicationic sites of anion-exchange resins. We present formal- and partial-charge methodologies for determining calculated electrostatic affinity between plutonium(IV) hexanitrato dianions and free analogues of dicationic anion-exchange sites. Both approaches correlate well with empirically-determined distribution coefficients for our bifunctional pyridinium-based resins (0.65 < r(2) < 0.98). This quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) will be useful in the determination of which structural modifications within a select series of bifunctional resins are most likely to be advantageous. Ultimately, we hope to refine this methodology to allow the a priori determination of ion-exchange behavior for a broad class of materials.

The conventional TBP method of uranium isotopes is insufficient to completely purify uranium from actinides such as plutonium and americium isotopes in highly contaminated soil samples. For overcoming the demerits of the conventional TBP extraction method, sample materials were decomposed with HNO3 and HF, and uranium isotopes were purified by TBP extraction and anion exchange columns and extraction chromatograph. Among the purifying methods of uranium, with a TRU Spec resin column after TBP solvent extraction, uranium was completely separated from the radionuclides in a highly contaminated samples. With the modified TBP extraction method, it was found that the concentrations of uranium isotopes were consistent with the reference values reported by the IAEA.

It does not routinely analyze for the actinides, specifically uranium, as it has been shown by previously by studies as reported by WELFORD and others that the concentration in food is very low. This was the result of a "Tri-City" study. However, at specific sites, the FDA has been requested to analyze for uranium. The concern is that either 'enriched' or 'depleted' uranium has been introduced into the environment and possibly contaminated the food supply. In addition some concern has been raised that water from wells or other sources used for processing food may contain uranium, both natural, depleted or enriched. This paper will discuss the methodology for the determination of isotopic uranium, specifically for uranium-238 (depleted) and/or uranium-235 (enriched) in the analyses of food and water samples and the results of these surveys.

Although these persons are generally not involved in any incident natural radioactivity from U, Th and Pa can be found in their urine or faeces. Uranium total activity in urine has been found with a range of 0.051 to 3.0 mBq/24 h and in faeces from 14.5 to 380 mBq/d. U-234/U-238 ratio for urine is 1.48 but this ratio varies from 0.47 to 19. By comparison, the U-234/U-238 ratio found in urine from workers in volved with natural uranium or 4.5% enriched uranium is 1.0 and around 4.0 respectively. Th-230, Th-228 and sometimes Th-232 have also been detected. The total thorium activity varies from 0.137 to 5.6 mBq/24 h in urine and from 9 to 183 mBq/d in faeces. 228Th h, generally been found in excess of Th-232. All these measurements were performed by alpha-spectrometry. The few Ra-226 results have been measured using the Lucas or emanation method.

Uranium and thorium isotopes were determined separately to prevent interference of Th-228 from U-232 tracer with Th-228 from natural series of Th-232. This procedure was applied to faeces from people living in the Popes de Caldas plateau a high natural radioactivity region of Brazil, and vegetables from the Laboratory of Environmental Monitoring (EML/DOE). Results show a chemical recovery of 80-95% for uranium and 46-72% for thorium.

J	Elliston, JT; Glover, SE; Filby, RH				Elliston, JT; Glover, SE; Filby, RH			The determination of natural uranium in human tissues by recovery corrected kinetic phosphorescence analysis	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Methods and Applications of Radioanalytical Chemistry (MARC-V)	APR 09-14, 2000	KAILUA-KONA, HAWAII	Amer Nucl Soc Top			PLASMA-MASS-SPECTROMETRY; URINE; BODY	Two typical methods used for the determination of uranium in human autopsy tissues are kinetic phosphorescence analysis (KPA) and alpha-spectrometry, both of which have significant limitations and advantages. KPA is limited because of the amount of sample used (1-10 mi for sample digestion followed by one mi KPA aliquots), no isotopic information is provided, phosphorescence degradation by salts in solution, and even more importantly, it does not provide chemical recovery information. For samples with sub ng uranium concentrations per g of inorganic material, preconcentration is necessary, which may require chemical recovery (other than simple evaporation). While alpha-spectrometry has very good radiometric detection limits for U-238, the very long half-life of U-238 (4.468 10(9) y) restricts its mass detection limit (27 ng). KPA on the other hand, has a detection limit three orders of magnitude lower (0.02 ng) for natural uranium. A recovery corrected method for the determination of natural uranium in human tissues was developed combining preconcentration of human tissues dissolved in 6M HCl by anion exchange with alpha-spectrometry and kinetic phosphorescence analysis, utilizing U-232 as a tracer. Solution aliquots containing up to 6 g of bone ash were preconcentrated for KPA measurement thereby allowing the use of up to 25% of the original sample solution weight for analysis by KPA. The radiochemical yield of U-232 was determined by alpha-spectrometry and the uranium content was determined by KPA. The mean radiochemical yields obtained for human tissue samples range from 65% to 106% with a mean of 85%+/-8%.

These matrices were then subjected to supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) to attempt to remove the uranium. SEs were repeated on the material remaining after SFE to determine any changes in partitioning. We have confirmed that under suitable chemical conditions, ligand-assisted SFE can be used to extract many metal ions from such matrices. Under the conditions we used, the "easily leachable" metals were extracted, but the refractory metals were not. In addition, SFE appears to redistibute the remaining metal cations among the remaining geochemical after SFE treatment. Our results are presented and discussed in the context of developing decontamination strategies for contaminated soils and sediments.
