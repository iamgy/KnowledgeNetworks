Compared to our previous electron scattering experiments with tensor-polarized deuterium at NIKHEF (Zhou et al., Nucl. Instr. and Meth. A 378 (1996) 40; Ferro-Luzzi et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 77 (1996) 2630; Van den Brand et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 78 (1997) 1235; Bouwhuis et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 82 (1999) 687; Zhou et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 82 (1999) 687) the target figure of merit, (polarization)(2) x luminosity, was improved by more than an order of magnitude. The target density was increased by upgrading the flux of nuclear-polarized atoms injected into the storage cell and by using a longer (60 cm) and colder (similar to 70 K) storage cell. A maximal target thickness of 1.2 (1.1) +/- 0.1 x 10(14) nuclei/cm(2) was achieved with deuterium (hydrogen). With typical beam currents of 110 mA, this corresponds to a luminosity of about 8.4 (7.8) +/- 0.8 x 10(31) e(-) nuclei cm(-2) s(-1). By reducing the molecular background and using a stronger target guide field, a higher polarization was achieved. The target was used in combination with a 720 MeV polarized electron beam stored in the AmPS ring (NIKHEF) to measure spin observables in electron-proton and electron-deuteron scattering. Scattered electrons were detected in a large acceptance magnetic spectrometer. Ejected hadrons were detected in a single time-of-flight scintillator array. The product of beam and target vector polarization, PePt, was determined from the known spin-correlation parameters of e'p quasi-elastic (or elastic) scattering. With the deuterium (hydrogen) target, values up to PePt = 0.49 +/- 0.03 (0.32 +/- 0.03) were obtained with an electron beam polarization of P-e = 0.62 +/- 0.04 (0.56 +/- 0.03) as measured with a Compton backscattering polarimeter (Passchier et al., Nucl. Instr. and Meth. A 414 (1998) 4988). From this, we deduce a cell-averaged target polarization of P-t = 0.78 +/- 0.07 (0.58 +/- 0.07), including the dilution by unpolarized molecules.

This has resulted in the identification of measurable "attributes" that characterize such materials. It has been proposed that the 871 keV gamma ray of O-17 can be observed as an indicator of the unexpected presence of plutonium oxide, as opposed to plutonium metal, in such materials. We have shown that the observation of the 871 keV gamma ray is not a specific indicator of the presence of the oxide, but rather indicates the presence of nitrogen. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Yapici, H; Ipek, O; Ozceyhan, V				Yapici, H; Ipek, O; Ozceyhan, V			Temperature distribution in nuclear fuel rod and variation of the neutronic performance parameters in (D-T) driven hybrid reactor system	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							CANDU SPENT FUEL; FISSION; REJUVENATION; BLANKETS; COOLANTS; URANIUM; ENERGY	Temperature distribution in nuclear fuel rod and variation of the neutronic performance parameters are investigated for different coolants under various first wall loads (P-w = 2, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 MW m(-2)) in (D, T) (deuterium and tritium) driven and fueled with UO2 hybrid reactors. Plasma chamber dimension, DR, with a line fusion neutron source is 300 cm. The fissile fuel zone is considered to be cooled with four different coolants with various volume fractions, the volumetric ratio of coolant-to-fuel [epsilon (Vm/V-f) = 1:2, 1:1, and 2:1], gas (He, CO2), flibe (Li2BeF4). natural lithium (Li). and eutectic lithium (Li17Pb8.3). Calculation in the fuel rods and the behavior of the fissile fuel have been observed during 4 years for discrete time intervals of Deltat = 15 days and by a plant factor (PF) of 75%. As a result of the calculation, cumulative fissile fuel enrichment (CFFE) value indicating rejuvenation performance has increased by increasing P-w for all coolants and epsilon. Although CFFE and neutronic performance parameter values increase to the higher values by increasing P-w, the maximum temperature in the centerline of the fuel roads has exceeded the melting point (T-m > 2830 degreesC) of the fuel material during the operation periods. However, the best CFFE (11.154%) is obtained in gas coolant blanket for epsilon = 1:2 (29.462% coolant, 58.924% fuel, 11.614% clad), under 10 MW m(-2) first wall load, followed by flibe with CFFE = 11.081% for epsilon = 2:1 (62.557% coolant, 31.278% fuel, 6.165% clad), under 7 MW m(-2), and flibe with CFFE = 9.995% for, epsilon = 1:1 (45.515% coolant, 45.515% fuel, 8.971% clad), under 7 MW m(-2) during operation period without obtained in fuel rod row#10 in gas, natural lithium. and eutectic lithium coolant blankets, it has been obtained in fuel rod row#1 in flibe coolant blanket for all epsilon and P-w. At the same condition. the best neutronic performance parameter values, tritium breeding ratio (TBR) = 1.4454, energy multiplication factor (M) = 9.2018, and neutron leakage (L) = 0.0872, have been obtained in eutectic lithium coolant blankets for the epsilon = 1:2, followed by gas, natural lithium, and flibe coolant blankets. The isotopic percentage of Pu-240 is higher than 5% in all blankets for P-w greater than or equal to 7 MW m(-2), so that plutonium component in all blankets can be never reach a nuclear weapon grade quality during the operation period.

Manual synthesis of this radiopharmaceutical is reliable, but time-consuming and may require handling of large quantities of radioactivity. We developed an automated IMT synthesis module, which prepares a ready-to-inject product that meets radiopharmaceutical requirements and is identical to the manually synthesised equivalent. Current advantages include decreased operator assistance time and reduced radiation exposure. Application may be extended to other radio pharmaceuticals. including high-dose preparations for therapeutic use. (C). 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Nath, R; Yue, N				Nath, R; Yue, N			Dosimetric characterization of a newly designed encapsulated interstitial brachytherapy source of iodine-125 - model LS-1 Brachyseed (TM)	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						I-125 source; interstitial brachytherapy; dosimetry	I-125; RECOMMENDATIONS; WATER	A newly designed encapsulated I-125 source has been introduced (Model LS-I BrachySeed TM manufactured by DRAXIMAGE Inc.) for interstitial brachytherapy. In this source I-125 radionuclide is contained in two ceramic beads positioned at each end of a titanium capsule. The source contains a rod of Pt-Ir, which serves as a radiographic marker for source localization in the patient. Principle photon emissions are 27.4 and 31.0 keV X-rays and a 35.5 keV gamma-ray. The 22.2 and 25.5 keV silver X-rays produced by fluorescence of the silver dopant in the ceramic bead radioisotope carriers, are also emitted. In this work, the dosimetric characteristics of the I-125 source were measured with micro LiF TLD chips and dosimetry parameters were characterized based upon the American Association of Physicists in Medicine, Task Group, No. 43 formalism. The corrected 1999 National Institute of Standards and Technology standard for low energy interstitial brachytherapy sources was used to specify the air kerma strength of the sources used in this study. The dose rate constant of the sources was determined to be 1.02 +/- 0.07 cGyh(-1) U-1. The radial dose function was measured and was found to be similar to that of the silver-based model 6711 I-125 source. However, the anisotropy function of the Model LS-1 BrachySeed (TM) source is considerably better than that of model 6711 I-125 source, especially on the points along and close to the longitudinal axis of the source. The BrachySeed TM model LS-I provides more isotropic angular dose distribution in tissue than model 6711 I-125 source. The anisotropy constant for the model LS-1 source was determined to be 1.006, which is considerably better than the value of 0.93 for the model 6711 source. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To study the consequences of this change for deposition sampling, monthly deposition data from two collectors located at a distance of 600m were compared from 1991 to 2000. On the average. the Cs-137, deposition rates differed by roughly a factor of two for whereas for the cosmogenic Be-7 a difference was not detectable with statistical significance. Further, a "funnel" collector with a mostly dry surface collected on the longterm average 36% less of Cs-137, but 8% less of Be-7, than a "pot" collector with a continuously water-covered surface. Since for Cs-137 deposition and the bulk deposition a similar behaviour was found, a stronger sensitivity of other resuspension-derived radionuclides against local and collector surface variations can generally be expected.

J	El-Dine, NW; El-Shershaby, A; Ahmed, F; Abdel-Haleem, AS				El-Dine, NW; El-Shershaby, A; Ahmed, F; Abdel-Haleem, AS			Measurement of radioactivity and radon exhalation rate in different kinds of marbles and granites	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article							NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; BUILDING-MATERIALS	Geological materials usually contaminated with naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) have become a focus of great attention. These NORM under certain conditions can reach hazardous contamination levels. Some contamination levels may be sufficiently severe that precautions must be taken. The present study deals with 60 geological samples (marble and granite) from both Egyptian and foreign locations. The studied samples were analyzed and the concentrations in Bq/kg dry weight of radioisotopes were determined by gamma-ray spectrometry using hyper-pure germanium (HPGe) detector in Bq/kg dry weight. The absorbed dose rate due to the natural radioactivity in the samples under investigation ranged from 2.45 +/- 0.07 to 64,44 +/- 1.93 nGy/h for marble and from 41.55 +/- 1.25 to 111.94 +/- 3.36 nGy/h for granite. The radium equivalent activity varied from 5.46 +/- 0.16 to 150.52 +/- 4.52 Bq/kg for marble samples and from 229.52 +/- 6.89 to 92.16 +/- 2.76 Bq/kg for granite. The representative external hazard index values for the corresponding samples are also estimated and given. The radon exhalation rates for marble and granite samples were also calculated by using solid state nuclear track detector (CR-39). The value of radium exhalation rate varied from 8.0 +/- 2.39 to 30.20 +/- 5.06Bq/m(2)/d for marble and 6.89 +/- 1.72 to 25.79 +/- 4.38 Bq/m(2)/d for granite and the effective radium content was found to vary from 1,700 +/-0.51 to 6.42 +/-1.08 Bq/kg for marble and 1.29 +/-0.32 to 5.63 +/-0.96 Bq/kg for granite. The values of the radon exhalation rate and effective radium content are found to correspond with the values of uranium concentration measured by the HPGe detector in the corresponding sample.

J	Ibrahim, ME; Saleh, GM; El-Naby, HH				Ibrahim, ME; Saleh, GM; El-Naby, HH			Uranium mineralization in the two mica granite of Gabal Ribdab area, South Eastern Desert, Egypt	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						leucogranite; spectrometric survey; metasomatism; uranium minerals	ORIGIN	Among the different rock units in the Gabal Ribdab area, the two-mica leucogranite and muscovite pegmatitic granite are the most favourable host rocks for uranium and thoriurn mineralization. The muscovite pegmatitic granite shows evidence of post-magmatic alteration, e.g. Na- and K-metasomatism, whereas the two-mica leucogranite could be regarded as being fresh. The spectrometric survey revealed the presence of three enriched zones with a maximum eU content of 140 ppm and the maximum eTh is 36 ppm. Uranophane, zippeite and becquerelite are the most abundant uranium minerals. The origin of these secondary minerals is mainly related to alteration of primary minerals by the action of oxidizing fluids, mobilization of uranium and then redeposition in other forms. Redistribution by circulating meteoric waters might have taken place. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Concentrations of radionuclides in samples were determined by gamma -ray spectrometer using HPGe detector with a specially designed shield. The obtained results of uranium and thorium series as well as potassium (K-40) are discussed. The present data were compared with data obtained from different areas in Egypt. Also, a solid state nuclear track detector SSNTD (Cr-39) was used to measure the radon concentration as well as exhalation rate for these samples. The radon concentrations were found to vary from 1.54 to 5.37 Bq/kg. The exhalation rates were found to vary from 338.81 to 1426.47 Bq/m(2)d. The values of the radon exhalation rate are found to correspond with the uranium concentration values measured by the germanium detector in the corresponding soil samples.

J	Dawood, YH				Dawood, YH			Uranium-series disequilibrium dating of secondary uranium ore from the south Eastern Desert of Egypt	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						uranophane; uranium-series disequilibrium; activity ratios U-234/U-238 and Th-230/U-234; Saharan pluvial period; Kubbaniyan pluvial period; Nabtian pluvial period	DEPOSITS; AGES	The secondary uranium ore of Um Ara mining area, south Eastern Desert of Egypt, is composed mainly of uranophane and beta -uranophane, They occur in the oxidized zone as idiomorphic crystals filling cavities and as coatings on the fracture surfaces of the alkali-feldspar and albitized granites. The activity ratios U-234/U-238 and Th-230/U-234 of the secondary uranium ore and host rocks indicate that there were two main phases of uranium mobility in recent geological time. An earlier precipitation of uranium from solutions forming the secondary ore and a subsequent mobilization resulted in adsorption of uranium to the host granitic rocks. The Th-230/U-234 age of secondary uranium ore varies from (50 +/- 10) to (159 + 69/-45) ka whereas, the age of uranium adsorption to the rocks ranges from (18 +/- 6) to (38 +/- 5) ka. The time of secondary uranium ore precipitation can be attributed to the Saharan II pluvial period which prevailed in Egypt during humid oxygen isotope climatic stage 5. The later uranium mobility and subsequent adsorption by the rocks took place during Kubbaniyan and Nabtian pluvial periods that coincided with oxygen isotope stages 3 and 1, respectively.

The huge mineral resources, viz. copper, uranium, magnetite, apatite and molybdenite, etc., make it significant from an economic as well as a geological point of view. The belt hosts three types of mineralization: sulphides of copper and other metals, uranium oxides and apatite-magnetite. Several distinct geological episodes are responsible for the evolution of mineralization and the thrust zone itself, Extensive and reliable radiometric prospecting and assaying have been carried out by us for the past 5 years from Dhobani in the east to Turamdih in the west of the Singhbhum shear zone. The present work indicates uranium mineralization in the Pathargora-Rakha area presently being mined for copper and also within areas in the vicinity of Bhatin, Studies on radon emanation have also been undertaken in some parts of the shear zone which indicate reasonably high radon emanation of the soils and rocks studied. This suggests the need for regular monitoring and suitable controls on the mine environment (air quality) and its vicinity. Radon emanation studies coupled with gamma-ray spectrometry and the subsequent modelling of the radiometric and radon measurements will help in the application of radon as a geophysical tracer in exploration of radioactive ore bodies and in radon risk assessment as well as in delineating active and passive faults and even in petroleum exploration.

J	Vasil'ev, AV; Sibirtsev, SN; Nazarov, AV				Vasil'ev, AV; Sibirtsev, SN; Nazarov, AV			Investigations of the microwave electromagnetic properties of pulp with fluxing additives	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								Vitrification of pulp-like radioactive materials with production of borophosphate and borosilicate glasses, using microwave energy at 2375 MHz and output generator power 5 kW, have been studied at the Mining-Chemical Combine since 1999. The conditions for heating the material being processed depends strongly on the electromagnetic characteristics of this material, specifically, the permittivity and the tangent of the dielectric loss angle. Investigation of the electromagnetic characteristics of the processed material and their analysis will make it possible to generate recommendations for effective execution of the process of vitrification of radioactive pulps using microwave energy. As a result of the investigations, the permittivity and tangent of the dielectric loss angle of a pulp simulator evaporated conglomerate (calcinate), and samples of glasses obtained from this pulp were measured, the materials increasing the dielectric losses of the calcinate at microwave frequencies were determined, and the dynamics of the variation of the electromagnetic properties of the pulp as a function of the content of the additives which increase the tangent of the dielectric loss angle was determined.

Using packets of Petryanov three-layer filtering materials, the dynamics of the volume activity of the products of the accident in the No. 4 unit and the daughter products of radon and thoron is traced, and the size of the carrier particles in room 207/5 is determined. It is shown that the Cs-137 concentration varied from 0.2 to 20 Bq/m(3). The median aerodynamic diameter of carrier particles ranged from 0.5 to 6 mum for Cs-137 and from 0.08 to 0.8 mum for the daughter products of radon. The sources of the coarsely dispersed cesium aerosols at maximun concentration were determined in both cases.

J	Roser, T				Roser, T			Nuclear power consensus and nuclear transports	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								Transports of spent fuel elements to the reprocessing plants of La Hague, France, and Sellafield, UK, as well as of casks with vitrified high-level waste returned to Germany were resumed in early 2001. These transports had been interrupted in 1998 after elevated levels of surface contamination had been found on the out-sides of the shipping casks. The transport issue was settled immediately in all countries affected except Germany, after the situation had been clarified. Numerous agencies involved as well as independent ones found that the increased contamination had to be removed, but had been neither dangerous nor, at that time, notifiable. The outcome of the German federal parliamentary elections in 1998 had produced a new government majority, thus changing the political environment for nuclear power. Opting out of the peaceful use of nuclear power in a properly arranged way and without having to pay compensation is the declared goal of the federal government. Accordingly, also transports of fuel elements for reprocessing are to be abandoned from 2005 on, and transports of spent fuel elements are to be minimized, for the time being, by building on-site interim stores. The government's policy and opt-out legislation raise a number of questions which will have to be answered in a satisfactory way in the future.

J	Hwang, JY; Chang, JBH; Chang, WP				Hwang, JY; Chang, JBH; Chang, WP			Spread of Co-60 contaminated steel and its legal consequences in Taiwan	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						litigation; Co-60; dose, low; gamma radiation	BUILDINGS; RADIATION	Since 1992, over 200 civilian residential and school buildings in Taiwan have been identified to have contained Co-60 contaminated steel rebar emitting excessive gammaradioactivity in living environments. These buildings were mostly constructed in early 1983 and 1984 by employing steels from one steel mill, which had recycled unknown Co-60 orphan sources in northern Taiwan. In 1994, a group of residents who once stayed for a protracted period up to 10 y in the contaminated Ming-Sheng Villa filed a civil action against Taiwan's nuclear regulatory office, the Atomic Energy Council, for state tort compensation of 3.4 M U.S. dollars in equivalent. After three years of court processes, the Taipei District Court handed down a decision in partial favor of the exposed residents. Both parties soon appealed against this judgment to the Taiwan Appellate Court. This article analyzes the main legal issues involved, including government's obligations to prevent and eliminate contamination, to take preventive measures, and to take necessary remedial measures; and plaintiffs' assertion on any legal right against governmental offices. Moreover, discussion issues contain the scope of damage and compensation, causation analysis, absence of effective and efficient regulation over radioactive contamination, limit of tort compensation law and compensation amount, weight of medical evidence as well as role of expert witnesses, and related comparative legal studies.

Perhaps the most important finding was that bone surface-seeking plutonium is more toxic at equal mean skeletal radiation doses (<3 Gy for Pu-239, < 20 Gy for Ra-226) than bone volume-seeking radium for the induction of skeletal malignancy by about a factor of 16 for a single intravenous injection of monomeric Pu-239. In addition, ancillary studies have shown that when plutonium transfers continuously onto bone surfaces from a depot of particulate Pu-239 in phagocytic cells, its relative toxicity per Gy average skeletal dose is enhanced by about a factor of 2. juvenile animals or dogs injected as mature adults were only about half as sensitive for equal mean skeletal doses as dogs injected as young adults. Male and female dogs were about equally sensitive to radiation of the skeleton by either radionuclide. Findings about radiation-induced fractures are summarized as well as data on the induction of soft-tissue malignancies by Pu-239 or Ra-226. Natural survival was not affected at the lower dosage levels of either Ra-226 Or Pu-239 as compared with control dogs given no radioactivity, but the survival of animals at higher levels was reduced. No additional life-shortening effects beyond those attributable to occurrence of radiation-induced malignancies or other radiation-induced effects were suggested by analysis of data for low dosage levels.

The analyses were for photon-emitting radionuclides (notably Co-60 and Cs-137), uranium, plutonium, and americium. Sediments were cored in 4 sections to 0.37 rn depth, whole fish were analyzed, and mussels were separated into flesh and shells. Radioisotopes of the cited elements were detected in sediment, some of the fish contained Cs-137, Am-214, and uranium, and mussel flesh contained Cs-137 and uranium. All of the Co-60, U-233, and enriched uranium, and some of the Cs-137 and Am-241, can most likely be attributed to Brookhaven National Laboratory. The other radionuclides (and some of the Cs-137 and Am-241) are believed to have either fallout or nature as their origin. The New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) evaluated the radiological data in terms of adverse health implications due to consumption of fish with the levels of reported radioactivity. The NYSDOH determined that the added radiation doses likely to result from eating this fish are a small fraction of the radiation dose that normally results from radionuclides present in the body from natural sources.

In surveying 4.14 cm(2) at 500 X magnification, 28 tracks were seen. From a calibration irradiation in a nuclear reactor we infer that the neutron fluence in 1945 was 5.7(+/-1.1) X 10(11) cm(-2); and, allowing for shielding by the structure in which the button was probably located, the free-air (i.e., outside) value is estimated as 1.5(+/-0.5) x 10(12) cm(-2). A limit has been placed on possible fading of the radiation-damage tracks that could increase the fluence by at most a factor of 1.27. The values bracket the calculated value of 9 X 10(11) given in DS86 but are higher than the 3.6 X 10(11) inferred from induced radionuclides for the distance given. The difference is, however, within the observed variability of the two types of results.

The concentration of 222Rn in open well water was found to vary in the range 0.14-25.4 Bq L-1 with a median value of 3.74 Bq L-1 and that in bore well water in the range of 0.22-197.0 Bq L-1 with a median value of 5.75 Bq L-1. From the measured concentrations the effective doses for the population of the region were estimated. The effective dose was found to vary from 0.09 mu Sv y(-1) to 204.2 mu Sv y(-1) for open well water consumers and from 0.2 mu Sv y(-1) to 1586.9 mu Sv y(-1) for bore well water consumers. The results of the present study are also compared with the literature values and discussed.

J	Qian, GG; Sun, DD; Tay, JH				Qian, GG; Sun, DD; Tay, JH			New aluminium-rich alkali slag matrix with clay minerals for immobilizing simulated radioactive Sr and Cs waste	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							ACTIVATED SLAG; CATION EXCHANGERS; CEMENT; CESIUM; TOBERMORITE; SORPTION; ZEOLITE; PASTES; FORMS	A new aluminium-rich alkali-activated slag matrix (M-AAS) with clay absorbents has been developed for immobilization of simulated radioactive Sr or Cs waste by introducing metakaolin, natural zeolite and NaOH-treated attapulgite clay minerals into alkali-activated slag matrix (AAS). The results revealed that the additions of metakaolin and clay absorbents into the cementitious matrixes would greatly enhance the distribution ratio, R-d, of selective adsorption whether the matrix was OPC matrix or AAS matrix. The new immobilizing matrix M-AAS not only exhibited the strongest selective adsorption for both Sr and Cs ions, but also was characterized by lower porosity and small pore diameter so that it exhibited the lowest leaching rate. Hydration product analyses also demonstrated that (Na+Al)-substituted C-S-H(I) and self-generated zeolite were major hydration products in the M-AAS matrix, which provided this new immobilizing matrix with better selective adsorption on Sr and Cs and lower leaching rate.

J	Li, YP; Burns, PC				Li, YP; Burns, PC			The structures of two sodium uranyl compounds relevant to nuclear waste disposal	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							BOND-VALENCE PARAMETERS; OXIDE HYDRATE; SPENT FUEL; CRYSTAL-CHEMISTRY; CORROSION; URANIUM; PHASE; 90-DEGREES-C; RELEASE; UO2	Single crystals of two sodium uranyl phases, Na-2[(UO2)(3)O-3(OH)(2)] and Na-4(UO2)(2)(Si4O10)(2)(H2O)(4) (designated NAUOH and NAURSI, respectively), were hydrothermally synthesized. Na uranyl oxyhydroxide (NAUOH) is monoclinic, space group P2(1)/n, a = 0.70476(3) nm, b = 1.14126(6) nm, c = 1.20274(6) nm, beta = 90.563(1)degrees, V = 0.96733(8) nm(3). The structure of NAUOH was solved by direct methods and refined on the basis of F-2 for 4027 unique reflections measuring using Mo Kalpha X-radiation and a CCD-based Smart APEX detector. The agreement index (RI) is 2.7%, calculated using 2955 unique observed reflections (|F-0| greater than or equal to 4sigma(F)), and the goodness-of-fit is 0.68. The structure contains uranyl pentagonal bipyramids that share vertices and edges, forming sheets parallel to (0 10). The sheets are linked by double chains of Na polyhedra located in the interlayer. NAUOH is a Na analogue of the mineral compreignacite, and may correspond to the Na uranyl oxide hydrate formed in studies of the oxidative dissolution of spent nuclear fuel. The phase Na-4(UO2)(2)(Si4O10)(2)(H2O)(4) (NAURSI) is the Na analogue of KNa3(UO2)(2)(Si4O10)(2)(H2O)(4), which was found as an alteration phase on hydrothermally treated actinide-bearing borosilicate waste glass. It is monoclinic, space group C2/m, a = 1.2770(1) nm, b = 1.3610(1) mn, c = 0.82440(8) nm, beta = 119.248(2)degrees, V = 1.2501(2) nm(3). The structure of NAURSI was solved by direct methods and refined on the basis of F2 for 1483 unique reflections measured with Mo Kalpha. X-radiation and a CCD-based Smart I K detector. The agreement index (R1) is 1.9%, calculated using 1333 unique observed reflections (|F-0| greater than or equal to 4sigma(F)), and the goodness-of-fit is 1.08. The structure is based on a uranyl silicate framework, with Na cations and H2O groups located in interstitial sites. The structure is closely related to that of KNa3(UO2)(2)(Si4O10)(2)(H2O)(4).

Disorder modeling under repository conditions	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							ION-IMPLANTATION; AMORPHIZATION; IRRADIATION; APATITES; PLUTONIUM; CERAMICS; ZIRCON	Amorphization resulting from alpha-decay events can strongly reduce the chemical durability of nuclear waste matrices. The creation rate of defects produced by alpha recoils in mono-silicated fluoroapatite was determined using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) on line with an ion implanter and compared to previous results obtained in fully phosphated fluoroapatite. In both materials, the defect creation is controlled at room temperature, by the amorphization process directly in the cascade. Furthermore, it has been shown previously that in mono-silicated fluoroapatite, the disorder recovery proceeds mainly via alpha-annealing. Taking into account our already published data and new results on the defect creation in the mono-silicated fluoroapatite, we have modeled the amorphization level evolution versus time under repository conditions. The main conclusion is the following: thanks to alpha-annealing, mono-silicated fluoroapatite loaded with (244)Cm, will maintain a disorder at a level low enough to prevent the total amorphization of the host lattice during the long-term disposal.

J	Dehaudt, P; Bourgeois, L; Chevrel, H				Dehaudt, P; Bourgeois, L; Chevrel, H			Activation energy of UO2 and UO2+x sintering	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article								Two methods were used to determine, in non-isothermal conditions, the sintering activation energy Of UO2 and UO2+x oxides, namely the temperature increment method and the constant heating rate method. The second method is easily applied to determine activation energy with a very small standard deviation, and to check that a single process is involved during densification. This study confirmed that activation energy is significantly reduced for O/U ratios between 2.01 and 2.17 in comparison with O/U = 2.00. In contrast, it is high when there is a high proportion Of U4O9 during sintering. Special attention is being paid to the influence of oxygen concentration preparation method on sintering activation energy kinetics. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Strontium chloride containing 3.7 x 10(2) kBq of Sr-90 was irradiated for 10 h in the hydraulic transfer tube facility of Kyoto University Reactor. Flux monitor wires, CO/Al and Au/Al alloy wires, were irradiated together with the targets to determine the neutron flux and the fraction of epithermal component (Westcott's index) at the target position. A high purity Ge detector was used to measure the gamma rays from the irradiated targets and monitor wires. The sigma(0) was obtained as 10.1 +/- 1.3 mb, and I-0 as 104 +/- 16 mb.

Less corrosion of structural materials during the decontamination is realized by pH control of the reducing agent. The pH of 2.5, attained by adding hydrazine to oxalic acid, was the optimum pH for maintaining a high decontamination effect and lowering the corrosion at the same time. As this reducing agent can be decomposed into carbon dioxide, nitrogen and water by using a catalyst column with hydrogen peroxide, the amount of secondary radioactive waste is small. These good features were demonstrated through actual plant decontamination tasks.

The dissolution rate of the oxides increased with increasing the HNO3/TBP ratio of the HNO3-TBP complex and the concentration of the HNO3-TBP complex in the supercritical CO2 phase. A remarkable increase of the dissolution rate was observed in the dissolution of U3O8 when the HNO3/TBP ratio of the reactant was higher than ca. 1, which indicates that the 2:1 complex, (HNO3)(2)TBP, plays a role in facilitating the dissolution of the oxides. Half-dissolution time (t(1/2)) as an indication of the dissolution kinetic was determined from the relationship between the amount of uranium dissolved and the dissolution time (dissolution curve). A logarithmic value of a reciprocal of the t1/2 was proportional to the logarithmic concentration of HNO3, C-HNO3, in the supercritical CO2. The slopes of the ln(l/(t1/2)) vs. In C-HNO3 plots for U3O8 and UO2 were different from each other, indicating that the reaction mechanisms or the rate-determining steps for the dissolution of U3O8 and UO2 are different. A principle of the dissolution of uranium oxides with the supercritical CO2 medium is applicable to a method for the removal of uranium from solid matrices.

Most of gas monitors are calibrated with a closed loop method. In this method, it is implicitly assumed that radioactive gases are statically released without rapid change of radioactivity concentration. However, actual radioactive gases are sometimes released in a short time-duration and with sudden change of radioactivity concentration. To confirm the applicability of the conventional closed loop method to such a kind of gas release, the responses of three typical gas monitors were analyzed in the manner of a pulse-like injection of a radioactive gas. The gaseous behavior in the sampling chamber of the monitors was evaluated from detailed observation of response curve. The gaseous activity injected pulse-like into the monitors was compared with that calculated from their response curves with the calibration factor determined by the closed loop method. These results show that the activity concentration in the sampling chamber becomes uniform as soon as the radioactive gas flows into the monitor. That is, the calibration factors determined by the closed loop method are applicable to both static and dynamic release.

Originally, the beta(eff) value was measured by the substitution method. In that method, the,beta(eff) value was obtained from measured reactivity change by substituting a Sb-Cd-Pb absorber rod for a 2.6 wt% UO2 rod for all core regions. In the present evaluation, we have employed the latest value for the buckling coefficient of reactivity to re-evaluate the substitution reactivity with high accuracy. In addition, the correction factor, which was ignored in the previous measurement, has been calculated to compensate the difference in the absorption cross sections of fuel and absorber rods. Consequently, the obtained beta(eff) value in the present evaluation was 0.00771+/-0.00017, and it is more credible than the previous one. The present result is available as benchmark data for the verification of delayed neutron data for light water reactors. For comparison, we have calculated the beta(eff) value using a transport code TWODANT with the JENDL-3.2 nuclear data library. The calculated beta(eff) value overestimated the experiments: the difference slightly exceeded the experimental error.

The light isotopes were preferentially fractionated into the amalgam phase. The single separation gains per mass difference were found to be in the range (4.90+17.8)(.)10(-4) for ytterbium and (2.2+3.8)(.)10(-4) for samarium. The divergence from the linear dependence between separation gains and isotope mass differences was observed and explained as the effect of nuclear field shift and nuclear spin effects. The maximum value of epsilon (u.m.) was observed to be 17.8(.)10(-4) for the lightest, neutron deficit isotope of ytterbium, Yb-168. The same value for the lightest isotope of samarium. Sm-144. with a magic number of neutrons (82), was close to the mean for other isotopes.

The average production yields of Co-57 and Cd-109 were 1179.93 kBq/muA(.)h, produced by direct and indirect reactions (11.31 days after the EOB) and 71.41 kBq/muA(.)h (EOB), respectively. The chemical separation procedure was developed in order to obtain a mixed calibration source of Co-57 and Cd-109, with a separation yield higher than 80%. The gamma spectroscopy technique was used for the radioactive analysis, using a HPGe detector. The stable elements were identified by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.

A trace amount of Pu was quantitatively adsorbed with an Empore (TM) anion exchange resin disk (47 nim diam.) at a flow rate of 150-200 ml/min from 8M HNO3 sample solution. The disk was washed with 10 ml of 8M HNO3 and 12 ml of 9M HCl and then the Pu was quantitatively eluted with 15 mi of IM HNO3/0.03M ascorbic acid solution. The time needed to separate Pu from the sample solution with the present method was about 20 minutes. The separated Pu was determined with alpha-my spectrometry and HR-ICP-MS. The present method was applied to the determination of Pu in the certified reference material (IAEA-135) and the environmental soil sample. The analytical results were almost in good agreement with the literature values.

Injection and breakthrough curves were obtained for uranine, (HHO)-H-3 (HTO), Na-22(+), K-42(+), Ca-47(2+), Co-58(II), Br-82(-), Sr-85(2+), Rb-86(+), Tc-99m (no breakthrough), I-131(-), Ba-131,133(2+) and Cs-134,137(+). The in situ experiments lasted for nearly 1.5 years, with single experimental times up to 10,000 hours. The tracer concentrations span over seven orders of magnitude between injection and sampling under practically undisturbed chemical conditions. Dynamic ranges in the breakthrough curves of up to four orders of magnitude were obtained. Thus, the use of radioactive (especially gamma -emitting) tracers showed to be a most useful tool for in situ tracer experiments. The relative retardation sequence obtained in the field experiment was Na < Ca approximate to Sr < K < Ba approximate to Rb < Co approximate to Cs, which was the same as the relative sequence of the sorption coefficients obtained in the laboratory experiments using crushed rock material. Thus, no scale effect was indicated in the relative retardation sequence between laboratory and field experiments. High recoveries, > 90%, were obtained for uranine, HTO, Br, I, Na and Sr and lower recoveries for Ba, Rb, Cs and Co. However, there were indications that there would have been higher recoveries of these elements if it had been possible to continue monitoring over longer experimental times. The low recoveries of Cs and Co indicate either slowly reversible or non-reversible sorption behavior. The laboratory diffusion experiments showed lower diffusivities and porosities and somewhat lower sorptivity of all studied tracers in the site-specific rock samples, dominated by mylonite, than in the diorite host rock. Matrix diffusion and associated sorption within the rock matrix is indicated in the in situ experiments, although this can not be verified without modeling that involves such processes.

The organic phase di-(2-ethyl hexyl) phosphoric acid and trioctyl phosphine oxide (D2EHPA-TOPO)/kerosene, which resulted from first and second cycles of uranium extraction from commercial phosphoric acid, was directly analyzed using Cd-109 as a primary excitation source. Copper was used as an internal standard, which led to a linear relation between relative intensity of uranium and its concentration. Three calibration curves. 0-100, 100-1000 and 1000-6500 mug(.)ml(-1), according to uranium concentration in the studied samples, were constructed. The effect of different molarities of D2EHPA and TOPO was considered. The detection limit, precision and accuracy were 1.1 mug(.)ml(-1), 3% and 1.4%, respectively. The obtained results were compared with other techniques such as gamma -ray spectroscopy, UV spectrometry and volumetry.

The main concept of the ARTIST process is to recover and stock separately all actinides, uranium and a mixture of transuranics, and to dispose fission products. The process composed of two main steps, a uranium exclusive isolation and a total recovery of transuranium elements (TRU); which copes with the nuclear non-proliferation measures, and additional processes. Both actinide products are solidified by calcination and allowed to the interim storage for future utilization. These separations are achieved by use of amidic extractants in accord with the CHON principle. The technical feasibility of the ARTIST process was explained by the experimental results of both the branched-alkyl monoamides in extracting uranium and supressing the extraction of tetravalent actinides due to the steric effect and the diglycolic amide in thorough extraction of all TRU by tridentate coordination. When these TRU are requested to put into reactors, LWR or FBR, for power generation or the Accelerator-Driven System (ADS) for transmutation, lanthanides are to be removed from TRU by utilizing a soft nitrogen donor ligand.								*AM NUCL SOC, 1981, ANSIANS8151981; BAUDIN G, 1992, INT INF EXCH PROGR A; CONDAMINES N, 1992, SOLVENT EXTR ION EXC, V10, P69, DOI 10.1080/07366299208918093; DOZOL JF, 1997, 17615 EUR; Forsberg CW, 2000, NUCL TECHNOL, V131, P252; GASPARINI GM, 1980, SEPAR SCI TECHNOL, V15, P825; GASPARINI GM, 1986, SOLVENT EXTR ION EXC, V4, P1233, DOI 10.1080/07366298608917921; *IAEA, 1999, GOV199919REV2 IAEA; KOLTUNOV VS, 1995, P INT C EV EM NUCL F; Madic C., 2000, 19149 EUR, P19149; Miller JE, 1998, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR DISPOSAL OF RADIOACTIVE TANK WASTES, P269; Modolo G, 1998, J ALLOY COMPD, V271, P248, DOI 10.1016/S0925-8388(98)00064-4; Nash KL, 2000, SOLVENT EXTR ION EXC, V18, P605, DOI 10.1080/07366290008934700; Sasaki Y, 2001, SOLVENT EXTR ION EXC, V19, P91, DOI 10.1081/SEI-100001376; SCHULZ WW, 1987, SEPAR SCI TECHNOL, V22, P191, DOI 10.1080/01496398708068948; Siddall TH, 1960, J PHYS CHEM-US, V64, P1863, DOI 10.1021/j100841a014; SIDDALL TH, 1967, J INORG NUCL CHEM, V29, P149, DOI 10.1016/0022-1902(67)80155-6; Suzuki S, 1999, SOLVENT EXTR RES DEV, V6, P72; Suzuki S, 1999, J RADIOANAL NUCL CH, V239, P377, DOI 10.1007/BF02349515; TACHIMORI S, 1994, J NUCL SCI TECHNOL, V31, P456, DOI 10.1080/18811248.1994.9735175; Weaver B., 1964, ORNL3559; XHU Y, 1995, RADIOCHIM ACTA, V68, P95	22	20	20	3	12	ATOMIC ENERGY SOC JAPAN	TOKYO	1-1-13 SHIMBASHI MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105, JAPAN	0004-7120			J ATOM ENERG SOC JPN	J.

J	Murray, CL; Green, MA				Murray, CL; Green, MA			Operational waste removal from Windscale advanced gas-cooled reactor (WAGR)	NUCLEAR ENERGY-JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH NUCLEAR ENERGY SOCIETY			English	Article						decommissioning; remote handling techniques; waste management & disposal		The Windscale advanced gas-cooled reactor (WAGR) is in the process of being decommissioned by BNFL. Prior to beginning decommissioning of the hot gas manifold (hot box) above the reactors neutron shield and graphite core, it has first been necessary to retrieve stored operational waste in order to clear the reactor's fuel channels. Operational waste is a generic term applied to items associated with the operating reactor, such as fuel stringer plug unit components and other items more permanently resident in the reactor in the period 1963-1981. The reactor shut down in 1981. After the reactor was defuelled in the early 1980s no agreed route for intermediate-level waste disposal was available and of necessity operational wastes were stored in the reactor's fuel channels as an expedient. This paper describes some of the assay findings in terms of operational waste radioactivity levels and compares these with calculations carried out prior to decommissioning.

The core is designed on the concept of a pressurized water reactor with a heavy water coolant and a triangular tight lattice fuel pin arrangement. The seed fuel assembly has an internal blanket region inside the seed fuel region as well as upper and lower blanket regions (i.e. an axial heterogeneous core). The radial blanket fuel assemblies are introduced in a checkerboard pattern among the seed fuel assemblies (i.e. a radial heterogeneous core). The radial blanket region is shorter than the seed fuel region. This study shows that the heavy water moderated core can achieve negative void reactivity coefficients and conversion ratios of 1.06-1.11. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Characteristic test of this device was done with a Cf-252 source and adopted to measure axial distributions of neutron densities of BWR spent fuels with various enrichments (2.0-3.4%), which had been irradiated up to 60 GWd tU(-1) at Fukushima Daini Nuclear Power Station Unit 2(2F-2). We found the measured neutron densities were proportional to about fourth power of the corresponding burn-up values. The neutron densities calculated by the ORIGEN2.1 code and various cross section libraries showed good agreements with the measured ones in profile and absolute value except for BWR-UE file mainly based on ENDF/B-IV. The BS240J32 library based on JENDL3.2 was the best among the investigated libraries. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
