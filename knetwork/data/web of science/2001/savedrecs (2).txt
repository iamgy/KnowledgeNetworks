A benchmark experiment on SiC was conducted at the deuterium-tritium (D-T) neutron source facility FNS in JAERI, and the validity of the cross section data for SiC was investigated. An experimental assembly made of sintered SiC (457 x 457 mm, and 711 mm in thickness) was bombarded by D-T neutrons, and neutron spectra,;gamma-ray spectra, dosimetry reaction rates and gamma-ray heating rates were measured in the assembly. Computational analyses of the experiment were performed by Monte Carlo transport calculations with the MCNP-4B code and several recent evaluated nuclear data files. The following findings were pointed out. The calculations with JENDL Fusion File and JENDL-3.2 predicted adequately the neutron fluxes from 14 MeV to 0.3 eV as well as the gamma-ray fluxes at any positions up to similar to 600 mm depth in the SiC assembly. Results for the calculation with FENDL/E-2.0 were similar to those with the two JENDL calculations, but the neutron fluxes in the energy range from 1 to 14 MeV were calculated slightly smaller. The cross section data for silicon in FENDL/E-1.0 were found inadequate for nuclear design calculations. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A proper, experimental set-up, in which a neutron spectrum is generated similar to that occurring in the ITER vacuum vessel, has been irradiated for sufficiently long time to create a level of radioactivity which has been followed, after shut down, by dosemeters for more than 2 months of cooling time. The experiment has been analysed using a rigorous, standard two-step method, i.e. using MCNP-4-B and FISPACT codes, and a new one-step method with an ad hoe modified version of MCNP code used in the nuclear analysis of ITER. FENDL-2 nuclear data libraries are used in both cases. The comparison between experiment and calculations shows a good agreement in both cases. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Beryllium pebbles with a diameter of 0.1-0.2 mm have been irradiated for 200 days in the High Flux Reactor (HFR) in Petten at temperatures ranging from 500 to 600 degreesC with a fast ( > 1 MeV) neutron fluence of about 5 x 10(24) m (- 2). Tritium inventories as well as release kinetics of both tritium and helium from the irradiated pebbles were investigated by out-of-pile annealing experiments, heating the samples with 7 degreesC/min up to 1000 degreesC and purging them with either He + 0.1 vol.% HZ or Ar + 1 vol.% Hz. According to previous studies, the tritium release from the pebbles was found to be slow and the maximum release rate occurred at a temperature of about 900 degreesC. Although tritium is released, no helium release is observed at temperatures lower than 800 degreesC. However, at 900 degreesC the samples showed a concurrent release of tritium and helium leading to the conclusion that T and He partially reside in common bubbles in the irradiated. material.

Tritium release behavior depended on the REDOX potential in the system. The chemical form changed from TF to HT or T-2 with increasing H-2 partial pressure of the purge gas, and tritium release rate increased also with that, which can be explained well by a tritium release model with an isotopic exchange reaction in the salt. As for the corrosion behavior, a thermodynamic analysis and static experiment were carried out. It was suggested that some kinds of oxide layers can work as a protective scale for ferritic steel, while for V-based alloys, no stable oxide film can exist in the presence of Flibe. REDOX control and/or corrosion-resistant coating should be developed for the corrosion problem. It is concluded that the REDOX control is a key issue for Flibe blanket systems, and future R&D items are pointed out. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

From the results of preliminary estimation of temperature distribution in the blanket in-pile mockup, the calculated values were 24-28% higher than the measured values.

However, at lower temperatures, the release process of tritium from the breeders is known to be rather slow. For this reason, there is still a need to develop techniques that promote the release of bred tritium. In order to improve recovery of tritium from blankets over a wide range of temperature, platinum and palladium were deposited on the solid breeder materials such as Li(4)SiO(4) and Li(2)TiO(3), by the incipient wet impregnation method. Out of pile tritium release experiments were conducted using the ceramic breeders irradiated in a research reactor. The experimental results of this work reveal the benefit of the addition of catalytic additive metals, which is very effective to increase the tritium release rate from ceramic breeder materials especially at comparatively lower temperatures.

The evolution of O-vacancy concentration (x(t)) allowed extrapolation to the steady-state value x(t --> infinity) = 0.0096 which was found to be independent from the material microstructure, while the process rate and its mechanism were found to depend on the grain size, porosity and sintering temperature of the pebbles. The temperature of tritium removal from the so-treated (reduced) pebbles was found to be higher than those from the oxidized (stoichiometric) ones, the increase of x being accompanied by an increase in the population of more energetic tritium trap sites at the grain boundary interface of the material. However, this phenomenon should not be of concern under 'normal' breeding blanket operating conditions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Since alumina has the capability of tritium permeation reduction the development of such coatings on ferritic martensitic steels by hot-dip aluminising of F82H-mod. steel sheets was already performed successfully. An improvement of these coatings were achieved by subsequent HIP'ping at 1040 degreesC for 0.5 h at 250, 500 and 750 bar and subsequently tempered at 750 degreesC for 1 h at 1 bar. All samples were investigated by means of metallographical examination, EDX line scan analysis and Vickers micro hardness measurements.

The control of tritium losses is an important issue in fusion technology because of its safety,and operational implications. This goal can be achieved using a tritium permeation barrier (TPB). The use of aluminium rich coatings, which forms Al(2)O(3) at their surface, has been selected as reference solution for WCLL blanket in order to produce reliable TPB. The hot clipping process is one of the two candidates for the production of coatings on large blanket segments. The effectiveness of hot dipped aluminium coating on MANET II steel has been verified in gas phase and in liquid Pb- 17Li, using a test apparatus named Corelli II. The permeation rate measured in gas phase is one order of magnitude lower than the one in liquid metal phase. Performing SEM-EDS analysis on the specimen, it was observed that micro cracks on the coating surface were present. The permeation curves in gas and Pb-17Li are reported and discussed. The characteristics of the new experimental device Vivaldi will be briefly described. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper investigations are presented of unirradiated chromium with a purity of 99.96% (DUCROPUR) and a dispersion strengthened chromium alloy Cr5FelY(2)O(3) (DUCROLLOY). Both materials have been produced in a powder metallurgical route. Mechanical tests of smooth and pre-cracked specimens have been performed in a wide temperature range. Below 280 degreesC the fracture toughness values of DUCROPUR are very low ( < 12 MPa m(1 2) =), above the transition temperature they exceed 500 MPa m(1 2) =. Large plastic deformations have been observed. DUCROLLOY does not indicate such a significant increase of fracture toughness in the tested temperature range. But above 400 degreesC large plastic deformations can be obtained in bending samples, too. The fatigue crack propagation behaviour of DUCROPUR at 300 degreesC is similar to that of a ductile metal.

Recent design activities within the Ignitor program have led to improve several of the main machine components. The present design of the central post allows for assembling and disassembling of the central transformer coils. The central post can take up the repulsive forces between the coils, this allows for greater freedom in programming the currents in the central coils and flexibility in controlling the plasma shape, the Plasma Chamber (PC) is supported through the ports by the Toroidal Field (TF) magnet structure. The new supports are designed to withstand the electromagnetic forces due to plasma disruptions and to allow the appropriate thermal expansions. The entire machine is cooled by helium gas down to 30 K, a system preferred to the hybrid helium-nitrogen cooling concept. Cooling the structural components at this temperature improves the role of wedging in withstanding the electromagnetic forces on the toroidal magnet. A metallic cryostat under vacuum was adopted. The vacuum reduces temperature gradients in the space immediately surrounding the machine, provides good thermal insulation, and second containment system for tritium. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

To realize this requirement, a conceptual tokamak design has been performed in accordance with plasma performance and shape at quasi-steady-state operation. One of the promising scenarios for this purpose is proposed to produce the plasma at the outward shifted radial position with a small minor radius for reasonable plasma parameters. From the analytical results, an appropriate space can be found for neutron shielding so that additional neutron shielding can be installed to protect the tokamak components from any neutron damages under the neutron fluence of 1 MWa m(-2). Based on the structural analyses, a two-stage blanket module concept is proposed, i.e. one shielding block with the first wall assembly during high Q operation and two shielding blocks or additional tritium breeding modules during quasi-steady state operation.

This requires tritium permeation barriers to be applied on the cooling tubes in the blanket. Taking into account the aggressive environments and the huge surface to be coated, the technology of permeation barriers appears as a tough challenge. To evaluate if it is feasible to lower the requirements on the performance of tritium permeation barriers, thus accepting a higher tritium permeation rate into the coolant and imposing a higher capacity in extracting tritium from the primary coolant, a conceptual study has been performed, mainly, focusing on economical aspects. The results, which seem up to now encouraging, are presented and discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Furthermore, these composites show a poor resistance towards the oxidation, they are porous and permeable to fluids. PFCs made of composite materials and in which joints and coatings are made with advanced materials pose some new problems regarding their safety. In particular, the following aspects have been addressed in this;paper: (a) tritium inventory; (b) activated dust in plasma chamber; (c) accident-relevant low-activation properties; and (d) long-term relevant low-activation properties. As a result of all the above mentioned aspects, some safety,relevant guidelines for the choice of joining and coating materials for PFCs are finally discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The plant model assessed considers low-activation martensitic steel for first wall and blanket, Li(17)Pb(83) as breeder/multiplier material and water as coolant. For many analyses in the frame of the SEAFP-2 programme, one-dimensional modelling of the geometry is adequate. So far an infinite-cylindrical model representing the radial build at the plant mid-plane from the central solenoid up to the cryostat concrete wall was used. Dose rates are evaluated both during plant normal running operation and after plasma shutdown before long term maintenance activity. Contribute clue to neutrons and gamma-photons are considered through a coupled n-gamma Sn transport calculation. Effects of streaming due to penetrations are also evaluated. Radioactive decay of materials is included. The radiation transport analysis has been performed with the Bonami-Nitawl-XSDNRPM calculation sequence of the Scale 4.4 code system, using the Vitamin (ENEA) library, based on ENDF/B-VI cross section data. The Anita-4M code (with the FENDL/A-2 activation data library and the FENDL/D-2 decay data library) has been used for activation calculation to evaluate the gamma sources due to material radioactive decay. The dose rates outside the cryostat concrete wall have been obtained with the XSDOSE code using ANSI standard neutron and gamma flux-to-dose-rate factors. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The model has been bench-marked against a set of foil activation measurements which were activated during an experimental campaign with deuterium/tritium plasmas. The model can predict the neutron activation of the foils on the torus hall walls to within a factor of three for reactions with little sensitivity to thermal neutrons.

Although only produced in small quantities, their study is of major interest, first for the safe operation of these devices, and second to forecast what can be expected in larger future machines. Analysis performed on the Tore Supra Tokamak has shown that three main processes are involved in the production of these radioactive elements: the capture of the neutrons produced by the plasma, photo-nuclear reactions caused by runaway electrons and proton-boron fusion reaction, which produces the radio-nuclide Be(7). On intermediate size machines, such as Tore Supra, the observed activities and dose rates are too low to justify any remote handling operation. A threshold can be defined in the neutron production for the limit between hands-on and remote maintenance, which is found around 10(20) neutrons per year, or 100 MJ of D-D fusion energy.

The management strategy aiming at reducing the amount of permanent radioactive waste is based on: (a) Recycling within the nuclear industry of in-vessel materials other than SiC/SiC. (b) Clearance (declassification to non-radioactive status). (c) SiC/SiC reprocessing for extraction of noxious radionuclides, and achieving clearance conditions for the bulk of the waste.

Both isotopes,participate in global material cycles, the carbon and the water cycle. If a retention time of 10000 years is assumed for the stored waste, (14)C emissions from the repositories dominate the radiation impacts. While the cumulated collective doses over a long term period are rather high and according to the discount rate selected would lead to significant external costs, the individual doses are small compared with the doses associated with the natural background radiation.

In case there is no tritiated water vapor in the released tritium gas, tritium was ideally removed by constant ventilation in spite of atmospheric conditions and residence time. On the other hand, when tritiated water vapor existed in the released tritium, residual contamination on the wall of the Caisson was detected and it was found that it depended on the initial humidity in the Caisson. This tritium removal behavior was successfully analyzed by considering the adsorption and desorption reaction rates of tritiated water on the wall by the constant ventilation.

Assessment of the torus radiation field is of prime importance in accurately predicting the likely doses. Correlation of the ambient dose-rate, the time spent in-vessel, and the actual doses to individuals show an apparent inconsistency, with the effective dose being approximately half of the expected dose. This paper aims to show that simple comparison of the ambient dose-rate, and the effective dose-rate is not appropriate in this situation because of the unique isotropic irradiation geometry that applies to tokamak vessel structures. The relationship between these two dosimetric quantities is compared, based on data from published sources; and discussed[ in relation to observations of doses to JET in-vessel workers. The measured effective dose to ambient (lose ratio, which is found to be in the range 0.5-0.6, agrees with calculated values. Future shutdowns at JET in 2001 and 2003 will continue to involve manned entries to install new components and perform upgrades, For continued demonstration of JET policy on ALARP, and for optimising manpower and equipment resources, it is important to have a firm basis for predicting the doses to vessel workers.

The investigation of this paper focused on achieving the top rated solution for the problem, the elimination goal, which requires complete elimination for the transuranic elements or the highly enriched uranium, and the long-lived fission products. To achieve this goal, fusion blankets with liquid carrier, molten salts or liquid metal eutectics, for the transuranic elements and the uranium isotopes are utilized. The generated energy from the fusion blankets is used to provide revenue for the system. The long-lived fission products are fabricated into fission product targets for transmutation utilizing the neutron leakage from the fusion blankets. This paper investigated the fusion blanket designs for small fusion devices and the system requirements for such application. The results show that 334 MW of fusion power from D-T plasma for 30 years with an availability factor of 0.75 can dispose of the 70,000 tons of the U.S. inventory of spent nuclear fuel generated up to the year 2015. In addition, this fusion solution eliminates the need for a geological repository site, which is a major advantage. Meanwhile, such utilization of the fusion power will provide an excellent opportunity to develop fusion energy for the future. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The atmospheric conditions, speed and direction of the wind, rain intensity or stability class, are key factors in the dry and wet deposition. The obtained results demonstrate that the wet deposition is critical for the incorporation of the tritiated water vapour to the natural biological chain. However, the dry deposition is the factor that influences in the tritium gas form. The conversion of HT into HTO in the soil is rapid (1 - 7 days), and 20% of HT deposited in the soil is reemitted to the atmosphere in the form HTO, while the rest incorporates into the biological cycle. The rain factor accelerates the incorporation of tritium to the ground, the superficial waters and the underground waters. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Endochondral bone (femur, tibia, humerus, radius, and ulna), membrane bone (skull roofing bones) and muscle of Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 55) that died at various times up to 65 weeks after the end of chronic inhalation of uranium ore dust aerosol (4.2 h d(-1) for 65 wk) and from age matched controls (n = 10), were analyzed for uranium, Th-230, Ra-226, Pb-210, and Po-210. Overall, during the period of dust inhalation, the nuclides accumulated in the above order of decreasing concentration in dry bone. However, the results demonstrate that there was some differential accumulation of uranium and uranium decay series radionuclides in muscle and two bone types of rats during the chronic inhalation period. The data also show that the bone levels of some, but not all, radionuclides decreased significantly with time after inhalation ceased. Lung uranium concentration at the time of death was a highly significant covariant for temporal changes in the levels of some radionuclides in both endochondral bone and membrane bone, indicating that lung remained a major source of these isotopes for accumulation in these bone types after ore dust inhalation had ceased. For some isotopes, the two bone types behaved differently during the dust inhalation period, and differently again after the dust inhalation ceased. The relative behavior of one bone type compared to the other for a particular isotope during the dust inhalation period did not predict the relative behavior after dust inhalation ceased. However, a faster accumulation of one bone type compared to the other for a particular isotope during the dust inhalation period predicted a faster decrease after dust inhalation ended.

Sr-90 contributed 11.6% to the total waste radioactivity. As a result of these radioactive discharges, about 28,000 local residents were exposed to ionizing radiation, and some of them received relatively high doses. Internal exposure of the population residing at the Middle and Lower Techa riverside was mostly from Sr-90 deposited in bone and tooth tissues. In order to reconstruct radiation doses to this population group, a study of 35 teeth extracted from local residents was carried out using electron paramagnetic resonance measurements. A total of 73 samples from these 35 teeth (tooth enamel, 33; crown dentin, 20; and root dentin, 20) were prepared and measured with electron paramagnetic resonance. The study revealed high doses (up to 15 Gy) absorbed in tooth enamel of the individuals born during 1945-1949, which was attributed to very high local Sr-90 concentration in tooth enamel of this particular age group in the population. The analysis presented here takes into account (a) the time courses both of the release/intake of Sr-90 and of the tooth formation, and (b) expected variations in measured absorbed doses due to differing geometric sizes of tooth structures. This methodology enables a more consistent picture to be developed of the Sr-90 intake by the Middle and Lower Techa riverside population, based on electron paramagnetic resonance tooth dosimetry.

J	Semkow, TM; Parekh, PP				Semkow, TM; Parekh, PP			Principles of gross alpha and beta radioactivity detection in water	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						water; alpha particles; beta particles; radioactivity, environmental	DRINKING-WATER	A simultaneous detection of gross alpha and beta radioactivity was studied using gas proportional counting. This measurement is a part of a method mandated by US Environmental Protection Agency to screen for alpha and beta radioactivity in drinking water. Responses of a gas proportional detector to alpha and beta particles from several radionuclides were determined in drop and electroplated geometries. It is shown that, while the alpha radioactivity can be measured accurately in the presence of beta radioactivity, the opposite is not typically true due to alpha -to-beta crosstalk. The crosstalk, originating from the emission of conversion and Auger electrons as well as x rays, is shown to be dependent primarily on the particular alpha-decay scheme while the dependence on alpha energy is small but negligible. It was measured at 28-35% for Am-241, 22-24% for Th-230, and 4.9-6.5% for Pu-239. For Po-210, the crosstalk of 1.2-1.6% was observed mostly due to energy retardation. A method of reducing the crosstalk to a <3% level is proposed by absorbing the atomic electrons in a 6.2 mg cm(-2) Al absorber, at the same time decreasing the beta efficiency by 16-31%.

An overseas collector submitted the winning bid of $82,000. Novacekite incorporates natural uranium as a major element of its composition. The object was evaluated primarily to aid in design of an appropriate container for shipment to the buyer. This collectible item was found to contain approximately 40 mu Ci (1.48 MBq) of natural uranium and its progeny. After removal of the particulate component by a single sheet of 1.6 min lead, the attenuation in lead of the remaining gamma spectrum was characteristic of Ra-226. A license was not required for this quantity of "source material." In addition to making recommendations regarding packaging and shipping, suggestions were also made to the seller regarding his safe handling of the object prior to its shipment.

As a result, these licensees may be cited for not tracking offsite occupational doses and quite possible for allowing some individuals to exceed the annual limits established by regulatory agencies. The accounting of occupational doses to "transient" workers is a difficult task. Unfortunately, written guidance to assist licensees on how to properly, address this issue is not available. This paper was developed to raise awareness among radiation safety professionals of the need to establish effective measures to properly track transient worker exposures anti maintain compliance with regulatory limits.

Materials and methods : Mn were scored using the cytochalasin-B technique. It is known that Mn can comprise acentric fragments or/and whole chromosomes. Mn containing whole chromosomes were identified by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a centromere-specific probe. The frequency and percentage of Mn were analysed with centromeres (MnC+) in lymphocytes of healthy donors and uranium miners with large radiation exposures several decades ago employed by the Wismut AG in the former German Democratic Republic. The miners were subdivided into those with and those without bronchial carcinoma. Results: It was shown previously that the relative frequency of MnC+ decreased with dose; this means that the number of Mn originating from acentric fragments increases. In the study presented here, no statistically significant difference in the overall Mn frequency was seen between the analysed groups. The fraction of MnC+, however, was highest in lymphocytes of healthy male donors (mean: 74.6%) followed by healthy miners (mean: 62.1%) and those suffering from cancer (mean: 55.8%). Conclusion : The results indicate the occurrence of a genomic instability in lymphocytes of miners, especially those with cancer.

J	Spearing, DR; Veirs, DK; Prenger, FC				Spearing, DR; Veirs, DK; Prenger, FC			Effect of the expansion associated with the plutonium alpha-beta-gamma phase transitions on storage can integrity	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article								The effects of the volume expansion of plutonium metal through the alpha-beta and beta-gamma phase transitions on a stainless steel storage container were examined. A cylindrical plutonium ingot was placed in the axial center of an annealed stainless steel cylinder and thermally cycled until a steady state in the strain response of the cylinder was reached. The average plastic hoop strain was 1.47% and 1.55% after six and four cycles through the alpha-beta and alpha-beta-gamma phase transitions, respectively. Elastic strain was similar to0.2%, indicating a 8.96 MPa back pressure on the Pu ingot. This is an order of magnitude less than the compressive yield strength of alpha- and beta -Pu at the transition temperature. Metallographic analyses indicate that anisotropic expansion of the Pu ingot is due to preferentially oriented grain growth of the beta -Pu along the axial direction due to stress applied by the steel cylinder during the alpha-beta phase transition.

J	Wang, WM; Roth, J; Lindig, S; Wu, CH				Wang, WM; Roth, J; Lindig, S; Wu, CH			Blister formation of tungsten due to ion bombardment	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article								Blisters formed at tungsten surfaces due to deuterium ion bombardment have been studied systematically in the energy range 100 eV to 1 keV. The bombardment with I keV D+ at room temperature (RT) shows that the blister size increases and the number decreases with the deuterium fluence from 1 X 10(19) to 1 X 10(21) D+/cm(2). No blisters are found at elevated temperatures between 600 and 800 degreesC. For bombardment with an energy as low as 100 eV, blisters are observed at the high fluence of 1 x 10(21) D+ /cm(2). The blister size increases and the number decreases with the bombardment energy. Combined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) ion beam depth profiling measurements have been used to investigate the effect of blister formation on the trapping behavior of deuterium in tungsten. Double implantations, where 4 keV He+ and 100 eV D+, respectively, were injected in W prior to the bombardment of I keV D+ show a pronounced increase of deuterium retention and blister disappearance. Possible mechanisms are proposed to describe the observed phenomena. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Fuel particles made from these alloys reacted readily with aluminum during fuel fabrication and post-fabrication annealing, resulting in large fuel plate thickness increases. Under irradiation, the behavior of U-5N-b-3Zr (wt%) alloy based fuel was poor at 41 at.% U-235 burnup, showing indications of incipient breakaway swelling. The post-irradiation microstructural characteristics of U-6Nb-4Zr based fuel were somewhat better than those of U-5Nb-3Zr, but is marginal at 70 at.% burnup. U-Mo based fuels generally show less reaction on fabrication and better fuel performance characteristics during irradiation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Release of deuteron in trapping site due to local molecular recombination with proton and the subsequent trapping of another proton into the vacant trapping site. The one way diffusion model has been formulated in form of the mass balance equations for free proton and both proton and deuteron trapped in napping sites which include the rate constants of chemical reactions for proton described above. The solutions of the concentrations or deuterons retained and protons uptaken in the specimen have been fitted to the experimental data and the rate constants of the chemical reactions relevant to the D-H exchange have been determined. The rate constants of the chemical reaction, are discussed. Moreover, potential applications of the one way diffusion model are discussed.

The isotope exchange capacity on the Li4SiO4 surface is experimentally obtained in this study. Most of the properties required for evaluation of the tritium inventory for various blanket materials have been already quantified by the present author,,. Then it has become possible to compare the tritium inventory in solid breeder blankets packed with either Li2O, LiAlO2, Li2ZrO3, Li2TiO3 or Li4SiO4 using the calculation model previously presented by the present authors.

The durability in deuterium recovery from Ar gas was examined for the hare and the Pd-coated powders at temperature, front 373 to 573 K as well as ale kinetics of deuterium absorption and desorption. The absorption and desorption of deuterium obeyed the First and the second order kinetics, respectively. The ZrPd layer on ZrNi did not alter the absorption and the desorption kinetics. The deuterium recovery by the bare Powder was degraded with time owing to oxidation of powder surfaces by impurities contained in the Ar gas. The durability in deuterium recovery was markedly improved by Pd coating, and no significant degradation was observed for the Pd-coated specimen at 573 K. This difference in the durability was ascribed to the difference in the oxidation behavior between ZrNi and ZrPd. It was concluded that Pd coating significantly improves the applicability of ZrNi to tritium recovery in blanket systems.

Simulated co-deposited layer on tungsten substrate was deposited by C2H2 or C2D2 glow discharge. The co-deposited layer was irradiated to UV lights from a xenon excimer lamp (172 nm) or ArF excimer laser (193 nm) and the in-situ decontamination behavior was evaluated by a mass spectrometer. After the UV irradiation, the hydrogen concentration in the co-deposited layer was evaluated by elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA) and the depth profile was analyzed by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). For the co-deposited layer formed by C2D2 glow discharge, it was found that M/e 3 (HD) gas was released mainly during the UV lamp irradiation while both M/e 3 (HD) and M/e 4 (D-2) gases were detected during the UV laser irradiation. Though the co-deposited layer was not removed by UV lamp irradiation, almost all the co-deposited layer was removed by UV laser irradiation within 1 min. The ratio of hydrogen against carbon in the co-deposited layer was estimated to be 0.53 by ERDA and the number of photon needed for removing 1 mum thick co-deposited layer was calculated to be 3.7 x 10(18) cm(-2) for the UV laser by SIMS measurement. It is concluded that C-H (C-D) bond on the co-deposited layer were dissociated by irradiation of UV lamp while the co-deposited layer itself was removed by the UV laser irradiation.

Though the major objective of GEMSAFE is to reasonably select design basis events (DBEs) it is also useful to elucidate related safety functions as well as requirements to ensure its safety. In this paper, we apply the methodology to fusion systems with future tritium breeding blankets and make clear which points of the system should be of concern from safety ensuring point of view. In this context, we have obtained five DBEs that are related to the blanket system. We have also clarified the safety functions required to prevent accident propagations initiated by those blanket-specific DBEs. The outline of the methodology is also reviewed.

The data on the performance of a blanket mockup with pebble bed under neutron irradiation is needed for the design of breeding blanket. To obtain such data, two kinds of the blanket in-pile mockups with Li2TiO3 pebble bed were developed and the in-situ tritium recovery experiments were carried out in the Japan Materials Testing Reactor (JMTR). In these studies. effects of various parameters, i.e., irradiation temperature, sweep gas flow rate, etc., on the tritium recovery behavior from Li2TiO3 pebble bed were evaluated. It was found that the tritium recovery (R) to tritium generation (G) ratio (R/G) increased with increasing the temperature of Li2TiO3 pebble bed and was saturated when the temperature of Li2TiO3 pebble bed at the outside edge exceeded 300degreesC. Additionally, the sweep gas flow rate in the range of 100 to 900 cm(3)/min affected very little the tritium recovery from Li2TiO3 pebble bed. A good prospect for the design of breeding blankets using Li2TiO3 Pebble hod was obtained from these results of in-situ experiment.

The Chemical Densified Coating (CDC) method has some advantage compared with another coating method. This method is capable to form densified coating on either the outer or the inner surface of a tube or a container. This process temperature is low (450degreesC). The fabrication technique of Cr2O3-SiO2 coating had been developed using CDC method. However, Cr2O3-SiO2 coating had open pores in the coating. For filling open pores, the densification treatment by CrPO4 was examined. In this study, the verification of open pores, the thermal shock resistivity, the adhesion strength and the deuterium permeability were evaluated and compared with Cr2O3-SiO2 (Type 1) coating and Cr2O3-SiO2 including CrPO4 (Type 2) coating. From these results, it was confirmed that Type 2 coating had a good adhesion property, and permeation reduction factor of SS316 with Cr2O3-SiO2 including CrPO4 coating reached about 1,000 at 600degreesC.

The blanket has multi-layer composed of solid breeder pebbles (Li2O) and neutron multiplier pebbles (Be) which are radially separated by cooling panels. The first wall and the breeding region are cooled by supercritical water below and above the pseudo-critical temperature, respectively. Temperature distribution and tritium breeding ratio (TBR) have been estimated by one-dimensional nuclear and thermal calculation,,. The local TBR as high as 1.47 ha, been obtained After optimization of temperature distribution in the breeder region under the following conditions: neutron wall loading of 5 MW/m(2), Li-6 enrichment of 30% and coolant temperature at inlet of breeder region of 380degreesC. In the ease of the higher coolant temperature 430degreesC of the breeder region the local TBR was reduced to be 1.40. This means that the net TBR higher than 1.0 could be expected with the supercritical-water-cooled blanket, whose temperature distribution in the breeder region would be optimized by following the coolant temperature, and where a coverage of the breeder region is assumed to be 70%.

J	Hsu, CW; DiPrete, AP; Eibling, RE				Hsu, CW; DiPrete, AP; Eibling, RE			Organic analyses of highly radioactive solutions requiring pretreatment by Cs-137 removal	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								The beta-emitting radionuclide Cs-137 is precipitated from the Savannah River Site (SRS) high-level waste by adding sodium tetraphenylborate (TPB). The concentrated and washed precipitate slurry containing CsTPB is transferred to Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) Salt Processing Cell and hydrolyzed to yield an aqueous product (PHA) free of benzene. The PHA is highly radioactive (1E+11 dpm) and contains some water-soluble organic compounds that need to be analyzed for process control and process history. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods were developed to analyze these compounds with instruments contained in unshielded fume hoods. Removing 137CS from pHA in a shielded cell prior to HPLC analyses is essential to minimize personnel radiation exposure. In this study ammonium molybdophosphate (Bio-Rad AMP-1) was used for removing Cs-137 in PHA (PH 3.8). With a two-step application of AMP slurry, a decontamination factor of 1E+4 was achieved for Cs removal. Two separate HPLC methods were used to analyze four polar organic compounds. The recovery of all the organic compounds were above 85%.

Extraction distribution ratios of Am3+ and Eu3+ have been measured as a function of pH, picric acid concentration, extractant concentration, diluent and temperature. The extraction of Am3+ is preferred to that of Eu3+, for both L-I and L-II, and the latter gives larger separation factor than the former. The equilibrium constants and thermodynamic parameters of extraction reactions were also calculated.
