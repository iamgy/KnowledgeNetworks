The measurements were performed using an annular source of Am-241 radioisotope as photon source and a planar Si(Li) detector. The measurements were performed under vacuum similar to 10(-2) Torr. The contribution due to photons scattered from the surroundings was minimized by placing the target and annular source assembly in a Pb housing, and using a vacuum chamber made of glass lined inside with Pb. Thin targets have been used to minimize the contribution of multiple scattered photons to the inelastic scattered peak. The product of the intensity of incident photons, detector efficiency, and other geometrical factors was determined by measuring the K X-ray yields from targets of different elements with 30 less than or equal to Z less than or equal to 69 excited by the 59.5 keV photons from Am-241 source and from the knowledge of K X-ray fluorescence cross-sections. A calibrated Am-241 radioactive point source was also used for this purpose. The measured inelastic scattering cross-sections are found to be in good agreement with those calculated using the Klein-Nishina cross-section for Compton scattering by stationary free electrons and the nonrelativistic Hartree-Fock incoherent scattering function S(chi, Z).

J	Williams, ML; Broadhead, BL; Parks, CV				Williams, ML; Broadhead, BL; Parks, CV			Eigenvalue sensitivity theory for resonance-shielded cross sections	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article								A method is presented to compute sensitivity coefficients far the eigenvalue of a critical assembly, including implicit effects associated with changes in resonance-shielded multigroup cross sections. Two alternative approaches, based on a forward and an adjoint solution, respectively, are developed to determine the effect of perturbations on the weight function used in group averaging of resonance cross sections. The forward method uses an automated methodology to compute the flux derivative with respect to various cross-section processing parameters. The adjoint method introduces adjoint equations far a multigroup cross-section functional and presents adjoint slowing-down equations for two common methods of resonance self-shielding. Expressions are presented for sensitivity coefficients of self-shielded group cross sections. These sensitivity coefficients are combined with conventional eigenvalue sensitivity coefficients to obtain a general perturbation expression for the multiplication factor. An example application determines the sensitivity of the critical eigenvalue to hydrogen density changes in a homogeneous sphere containing low-enriched uranium, it is shown that changes in (238)U-shielded cross sections caused by perturbations in hydrogen concentrations are important components in the overall eigenvalue sensitivity coefficient, which is predicted well by the developed method.

These shortcomings may pose a serious challenge particularly during the reprocessing of (a) short cooled thermal reactor fuels, (b) fast reactor fuels with the larger Pu content and significantly higher burn up, and (c) while treating various waste streams for their disposal to the environment. The N,N-dialkyl aliphatic amides have received particular attention as alternate potential extractants for the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels in view of (a) the innocuous nature of their degradation products, namely, carboxylic acids/amines and (b) the possibility to incinerate the used solvent leading to reduced volume of secondary waste. The physical and chemical properties of these amides are influenced strongly by the nature of alkyl groups. The extractant N,N-dihexyl octanamide (DHOA) was found to be a promising candidate among a large number of extractants studied. Laboratory batch studies as well as mixer settler studies were performed under process conditions with DHOA and compared with those of TBP. DHOA was found to extract Pu(IV) more efficiently than TBP, both at trace-level concentration as well as under uranium loading conditions. In addition, the extraction behavior of Am(III) and Zr(IV) was studied at varying nitric acid concentrations (1 to 6 M). Extraction behavior of uranium at macroconcentrations (9.9 to 157.7 g/l) was carried out at different temperatures, and it was observed that D-U decreased with the increase in U loading as well as with the increase of temperature (in the range 25 to 45 degreesC) and that the two-phase reaction was exothermic in nature. Mixer settler studies on U(VI) revealed that DHOA is similar to TBP during the extraction cycle but better than TBP during the stripping cycle.

This process has recently been successfully demonstrated with irradiated EBR-II fuel at Argonne National Laboratory-West. Part of the EMT process is to immobilize fission-product-bearing waste salt, which results from electrorefining, in a ceramic waste form - a glass-bonded sodalite. The sodalite is formed by hot isostatically pressing salt-loaded zeolite at temperatures up to 850 degreesC and pressures up to 100 MPa. The specific unit operations that comprise ceramic waste production include steps for salt grinding, zeolite drying, blending salt and zeolite and glass frit in a v-blender, and consolidating the powders in a hot isostatic press. The results of testing these unit operations with irradiated salt from the EMT demonstration are summarized and include some preliminary characterization of the final irradiated ceramic waste form created by this process.

The goal of the treatment is the ablation of diseased synovial membranes in articulating joints. The treatment of knee joints is the focus of this work. A method was developed, as discussed previously, to predict the dose distribution in a knee joint from any neutron and photon beam spectra incident on the knee. This method is validated and used to design moderators for the deuterium-deuterium (D-D) and deuterium-tritium (D-T) neutron sources. Treatment times >2 h were obtained with the D-D reaction. They could potentially be reduced if the B-10 concentration in the synovium was increased. For D-T neutrons, high therapeutic ratios and treatment times <5 min were obtained for neutron yields of 10(14) s(-1) This treatment time makes the D-T reaction attractive for boron neutron capture synovectomy.

The polymers were irradiated with uranium, gold and lead ions of about 10 MeV/u and ion fluences between 1 x 10(10) and 4 x 10(11) ions/cm(2). The ion irradiated probes show two quite different dependencies of the diffusion constant on the ion energy loss. These effects are strongly related to the fluence of the irradiation. In case of low ion fluences, the diffusion constant is up to 8 times higher than that of pristine material. In the probes with high ion fluences we observe a decrease of diffusion constant to half the value of the pristine material. To understand the dependence of the diffusion constant on ion fluences we apply a model of compacting. This model describes the compacting ability of shockwaves arising from latent tracks. A track formation model is suggested. When an ion penetrates the foil it creates shockwaves around its path. These shockwaves put compacting forces on earlier created latent tracks in the same foil.

The system consists of three main components: (i) the alpha exposure chambers, including alpha monitoring devices and the connection with the Ra-226 radioactive source. The CR-39 track detectors are mounted in the monitoring devices pre-equipped or not with paper filter; (ii) the calibrated Ra-226 source. Among the three tested sources: Rn-222, Ra-226 +Rn-222 and Ra-226, the Ra-226 source is considered the most appropriate radon source for our calibration system. It is kept into an airtight flat bottom flask, the radionuclide Ra-226 being always in the radioactive equilibrium with their descendants. In the alpha exposure chambers, the source assures the radon at a constant rate; (iii) the ALFAUURASE program for the computation of radioactive accumulation of the alpha Ra-226 descendants. For any initial mass of the parent, the amount and the activity of each alpha decay product and of all the decay products can be calculated by this computation program. Each component of the calibration system is described in the paper. The use of the system for the calibration of CR-39 track detectors in radon measurements is tested. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Brandt, R				Brandt, R			Some contributions from SSNTD towards nuclear science: from multifragmentation towards accelerator driven systems (ADS)	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	20th International Conference on Nuclear Tracks in Solids	AUG 28-SEP 01, 2000	PORTOROZ, SLOVENIA	Minist Sci & Technol Slovenia, European Nucl Soc		multifragmentation; superheavy elements; accelerator driven systems; anomalons	TRANSMUTATION	Three examples are chosen to show the importance of SSNTD as one of the essential tools in nuclear science: (1) Multifragmentation into more than two heavy reaction products: Starting with the observation of three heavy reaction products in the interaction of relativistic protons or 414 MeV Ar-40 with actinides in the early 1960s, up to the observation of five heavy reaction products in the interaction of 2400 MeV U-238 with uranium, SSNTD had a leading role in this research. (2) In the search for superheavy elements (SHE: Z around 114): Many different techniques are used. However, SSNTD are exclusively decisive in the possible observation of SHE within the heavy element component of galactic cosmic rays. (3) Accelerator driven systems: They are increasingly important in the discussion of energy producing nuclear power stations and in the corresponding ability to transmute long-lived poisonous radioactive materials (above all plutonium) into shorter lived fission fragments or stable nuclides. SSNTDs play an important role in the determination of the energy dependent neutron fluence in small volumes (approximate to cm(3)) or in the exact beam profile determinations of the primary proton beams. This contribution ends with an outlook into possible future fields of physics research: With the advent of a new generation of relativistic heavy ion accelerators, such as the NUCLOTRON at the JINR in Dubna, Russia, and RHIC in Brookhaven in the United States, one can continue to study (and finally confirm or disprove) all phenomena mentioned already, as well as additional controversial phenomena, such as "enhanced nuclear cross-sections over short distances", called colloquially "anomalons". Again SSNDT can be used in at least a twofold manner as an important tool: (a) the enhanced neutron production with C-12 ions or heavier ions in thick targets at energies above approximately 50 GeV and (b) the reduced "mean-free-path" of secondary fragments produced by the same heavy and energetic ions.

This method is based on the relationship between the energy deposited in the material by ionizing particles and the track developed after a well-established chemical process. The experimental study included alpha particles in the energy range from 3.2 to 5.8 MeV emitted by Gd-148, U-238, Pu-239 and Cm-244. The quantitative results provide a clear signature to identify each one of the radioisotopes based on the formed track parameters. The track analysis is performed with a digital image analysis system associated with a PC mathematical processor. The wide range energy response makes this method a promising analysis system.

In 1998, we have started the determination of radon in soil air using solid state nuclear track detectors on a monthly basis. Tritium was determined out of water sampled at the mud volcano vents by means of both mass spectrometry and liquid scintillation. Na-22, Cl-36 were also determined by means of a low background gamma spectrometer placed at a depth of 50 m in our underground laboratory. It was found that mud volcano fluids are of partial deep origin. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In view of the harmful effects on human health due to the processing and use of such fertilizers in agriculture, it is important to analyse phosphate rocks for uranium content determination. Ten representative rock samples from Kakul phosphate deposit exposed near Abbotabad, Pakistan which are used for the manufacturing of fertilizers were studied for uranium content determination with the help of fission track and neutron activation analysis techniques. Each sample was split into three parts. The first and second parts (solid slabs and pellets) were subjected to fission track analysis, while the third part was analysed using neutron activation analysis technique for comparison. On the average a uranium content of 37 ppm was found in the phosphate rocks. The results of uranium content determinations with the help of fission track and neutron activation analysis techniques show a remarked resemblance up to +/-0.1%. This indicates that the fission track analysis technique of uranium content determination is a reliable method inspite of its simplicity. The uranium content in the Kakul deposits is within the permissible limit allowed for the mining and processing of the phosphate rocks for the manufacturing of fertilizers.

No chronological data are known for the Bragin pallasite. Our attempt to reconstruct its cosmic history was based on the interpretation of fission-track analysis data. To apply this method only uranium-rich phosphates can be used. Extremely rare grains of stanfieldite were extracted from the silicate sawing residue and from the pallasite sample directly. The researches pursued by us made it possible to find two populations of fossil tracks in stanfieldite grains. The tracks of these populations strongly differed both in size, shape and character of distribution. The first population, consisting of short (L similar to2-6 mum instead of L similar to8-12 mum for induced fission tracks), round-shaped tracks irregularly distributed, as we suppose, suffered an intense heating process, which caused a significant amount of partial annealing. The second population, consisting of longer (L similar to8-12 mum), rhombic-shaped tracks homogeneously distributed, occurred after this thermal event. Only the second population track density was used for the fission-track age calculation. After correction of the fossil track density, consisting of the second population tracks, for other possible track sources, the revealed tracks were unequivocally identified as those due to the spontaneous fission of Pu-244 and U-238. The largest part of them was attributed to the spontaneous fission of Pu-244; rho (Pu)/rho (U) approximate to 3. The model fission-track age of the studied pallasite turned out to be 4.20 Gyr. This value fix the time of the last shock/thermal event in the cosmic history of the Bragin pallasite, which had caused the partial annealing of tracks presented to that time and "fission-track clock" reset.

RBS analyses on Durango apatites irradiated by Krypton ions have previously shown the progressive fragmentation of tracks by annealing. This study made for different irradiation energies corresponding to those of uranium fission fragments has been completed by TEM and AFM on etched tracks. In all cases, segmentation figures have been observed, that clearly necessitates to introduce fragmentation of latent tracks to model the length distribution of uranium etched fission tracks. This presentation concerns the case of a homogeneous population of tracks with partial amorphization. The next step will consist in considering multiple sub-populations with different segmentation rates. This algorithm is a new aspect to be included in our model, which already takes into account diffusion and crystallography in the track etching process. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This material is now out of stock and a project for the preparation of two new reference glasses is underway. The new glasses, containing nominally 15 and 55 mg kg(-1) uranium, were prepared from blended oxide powder, and cast using an improved method, which minimised micro-scale defects and optimised the yield. Glass rods were produced which were then cut into discs of 2 mm thickness and 15 mm diameter and subsequently polished. Uranium homogeneity and fission-track stability are critical properties of the glass. An extensive study was carried out to verify the homogeneity by fission-track counting, investigating both within-disc and between disc effects, and to investigate potential track fading due to thermal annealing, No evidence of uranium heterogeneity was detected. The stability study, using an "isochronous" method, in which all measurements are made at the end of exposure to artificial ageing, is still underway. The reference material will be certified for isotopic composition (natural), uranium mass fraction and neutron fluence (one disc out of each set of three will be irradiated, together with a mica foil, to induce fission tracks in a certified fluence). The reference materials will be released as IRMM-540R (15 mg kg(-1) U) and IRMM-541 (55 mg kg(-1) U). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Seven stations were selected in the investigated district, which covers an area of about 2300 km(2) in the northern and western part of Jordan. Five holes were dug in each station at different depths. Two to three passive dosimeters using plastic detectors (CR-39) were put in each hole. Two weeks later, the dosimeters were collected and chemically etched. Some soil and rock samples from the study area were collected and analyzed for radioactive nuclides using gamma -ray spectroscopy. The correspondence between radon levels in the soil gas and its precursor concentrations is not clear. However, the study confirms the exponential increase in radon level with depth. In general, Al-Hisa phosphate limestone showed the highest radon concentration while Amman silicified limestone showed the lowest concentration. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The U-238 content of samples of the soil or the bedrock can be measured by gamma ray spectrometry and is of interest because the uranium content in the soil is a precursor of the presence of the radon gas in the soil. The emanation of radon gas from different types of material can be estimated to some extent if the content of U-238 of a sample is known and the Ra-226 content is only minorly affected. The true emanation is, however, affected by various parameters. One of these parameters is the possibility or not for the ps to come out from the grains into the air in the space between the grains of the sample. In this study we report the results from measurements of radon gas emanating from samples of soil frequent in the Lund region in Sweden and in the Barcelona region in Spain. As soils have different grain size it is important to know the type of soil. The U-238 content of the soil is measured with gamma ray spectrometry. The radon measurements are made by Kodak plastic film in closed cans, filled with the soil according to a technique, developed for radon measurements in water samples. The result shows, that the combination of grain size and uranium content is important for the emanation of the radon gas from the grains of the soil. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Most of the scientists actively engaged in the solution of the complex problem of personal neutron dosimetry by damage track detectors-SSNTD, have attempted to develop individual radon monitoring for exposure in mines by using the same SSNTDs. In late 1970s and the early 1980s, new radon monitoring devices based on SSNTDs have been developed to measure radon in soil, mainly for applications in uranium prospecting or more generally in earth sciences. Most of the radon monitors, developed since then for completely different applications in mind, have been used later for large scale survey of indoor radon. With the current implementation within Europe of the European Union Directive 96/29, applications of damage track detectors will increase drastically, specially for the assessment of the exposure of the workers to natural sources of radiation. In this case, the early work on personal neutron/radon dosimetry, is highly valuable to tackle these new problems of individual monitoring. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The main method is based on the radiochemical separation of U, Np-Pu, Am-Cm on ion-exchange and extraction columns. An identification of radionuclides and determination of their content are performed using alpha-spectrometry. The microconcentrations of the sum of the main fissile materials U-235 and Pu-239 are determined with plastic track detectors. An independent method of U-238 content determination is the neutron activation analysis. Am-241 content is possible to be determined by gamma-spectrometry. A chemical composition of macrocomponents is determined by the atomic-absorption spectrophotometry method. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Time integrated track etch technique has been used for the measurement of indoor radon levels. Bare cellulose nitrate LR-115 type II films have been used as detectors in the survey of radon. The calibration constant of 4.8 x 10(2) tracks cm(-2) day(-1) per WL of radon at equilibrium (which corresponds to 12.97 x 10(-2) tracks cm(-2) d(-1) per Bq m(-3)) determined by Subba Ramu et al. (Sci. Total Environ. 73 (1988) 245) has been used to express radon activity in Bq m(-3). In some of the dwellings the levels of radon activity are found to be quite high giving an annual exposure dose that crosses the safety limits set by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP, Protection against radon-222 at home and at work, ICRP Publication 65, Annals of the ICRP, 23 (2), 1993). A study of seasonal variations of indoor radon in some of the dwellings has also been carried out. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

After uranium, the thorium was used by us in such studies. In this paper, the Th biodistribution, retention and elimination in the internal contamination by ingestion is described. Three Wistar-London breed rats were internally contaminated by ingestion with Th solution. Each of them has received an equal quantity corresponding to a Th Annual Limit Intake. The rats were sacrificed at different time intervals after contamination. Immediately after the sacrificing, their vital organs were sampled and calcined. In order to determine Th contents the samples were analysed by the fission track method. The obtained results led us to conclude on the Th biodistribution, retention and elimination by rats. The comparison between the U internal contamination and that using Th showed some interesting differences. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Passive diffusion dosimeters (using CR-39) were used indoors in different seasons. The average radon concentration during summer season was about 62 Bq/m(3) (similar to 1.7 pCi/l which corresponds to 0.017 WL for the equilibrium factor, F = 1), while in winter season it was about 81 Bq/m(.)(3) However, the overall radon average in Al-Mazar is comparable to the radon average in other Jordanian cities. Furthermore, the radon average concentration during the year was about 75 Bq/m(3) (similar to 2.0 pCi/l which corresponds to about 0.02 WL). According to these findings, the chances of dying from lung cancer due to exposure, over the lifetime, to 0.02 WL of radon level is about 0.09%. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

That isotope is often the component of a naturally existing element. Autoradiography is one of the methods allowing us to detect natural radioactivity of elements. Using autoradiography, we can carry out non-destructive and non-sampling investigations of the historical glassware. The main purpose of such work was to determine the potassium content in the tested glassware as well as to determine the chemical homogeneity of the object. The natural radioactivity of the isotope K-40 has been used here. The broken stem of an 18th century goblet, made of colourless, high quality glass has been analysed. Our experiment consisted of two parts: examination of model glasses with calibration of the method and examination of broken stem. Obtained results showed us large inhomogeneity of the old glass. Differences in K2O concentration were in the range of 13-20%. It means that chemical inhomogeneity of historic glasses cannot be omitted during investigations that require sampling.

Based on this calibration and introducing corrections due to the angle, gamma -dose, and etching time dependences of the detector response, fast neutron flux inside spent fuel assemblies was found to be in the range of 10(2)-10(6) n cm(-2) s(-1), depending on burnup and cooling time. The effect of adjacent assemblies can decrease substantially, if the detector surface is perpendicular to the axis of the fuel assembly. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The principles of the APXS operation are based on three interactions of alpha particles with matter: Rutherford alpha backscattering; (alpha, p) nuclear reactions; and X-ray generation by charged particles and X-ray excitation. The APXS, as was implemented on the Pathfinder mission, uses for all three modes of operation a monoenergetic beam of alpha particles from about 40 mCi of Cm-244 radioisotope. It employs Si charged particle detectors for alpha and proton modes and a specially designed silicon PIN detector for its X-ray mode that does not require cooling for its operation. The APXS can detect all of the elements (except H and He) present above a few tenths of a percent for all major elements and several hundred ppm for many minor and trace elements. The APXS on Pathfinder was transported to various locations on the martian surface by the Sojourner rover which enabled it to analyze multiple soil and rock samples selected by the science team from the lander camera images. The APXS performed excellently under the adverse martian environment conditions and provided important information about the chemical composition of the martian soil and rocks. All of the analyzed rocks at the Pathfinder site were found to have high concentrations of silica, sulfur and iron, and low in magnesium, similar to those of the terrestrial basaltic andesites and definitely different from the SNC meteorites that are believed to have originated from Mars. All of the soil samples analyzed by the APXS have similar composition and are very close to the soil analyses obtained by the two Viking missions. The information derived from the Pathfinder APXS has significant implications about the origin and evolution of planet Mars. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The intrinsic method was used to detect UVR, while trap depth and frequency factors were estimated using the initial rise method. We have studied TL intensity as a function of exposure time, observing high sensitivity of TLD-500 to UVR. Conversely, TLD-400 displays weak sensitivity to these same radiations. Although TLD-900 and TLD-200 are both less sensitive to UVR than TLD-500, they each provide a linear response to UVR. The possible use of these phosphors as UV dosimeters has been further appraised, examining thermal fading effects and fading due to light exposure. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The internal walls, the ceiling, and the floor of the chamber are covered with copper sheets. The new detection system consists of a stainless steel hollow cylinder with variable circular apertures in the cylindrical wall and in the base, to allow introduction of a NaI (TI) crystal, or alternatively, a HPGe detector in its interior. This counting system is mounted inside the larger chamber, which in turn is located in a subsurface air-conditioned room. The access to the subsurface room is made from a larger entrance room through a tunnel plus a glass anteroom to decrease the air-exchange rate. Both sample and detector are housed inside the stainless steel cylinder. This cylinder is filled with hyper pure nitrogen gas, before counting a sample, to prevent radon coming into contact with the detector surface. As a consequence, the contribution of the Bi-214 photopeaks to the background gamma spectra is minimized. The reduction of the gamma radiation background near the detector facilitates measurement of naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM), and/or technologically enhanced NORM (TENORM), which are usually at concentration levels only slightly higher than those typically found in the natural radioactive background.

In this paper we present a method to determine the detection efficiency of a HPGe detector as a function of the spatial position of the source. This method is based on the Monte Carlo simulation of gamma-ray pencil beams, incident on different positions on the detector crystal. Integration of the efficiency of the pencil beams renders the detector efficiency. This allows for determination of the efficiency in more complicated systems, like collimated detectors. The result of the method is compared to the measured efficiency of two detectors. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Enhancements of U concentrations relative to other analysed isotopes within the U series have been observed, being due to co-precipitation of U with heavy metals in accord with increases in pH along the river. The U excess can be traced to uranium dissolution in waters that have been used as a part of a mineral treatment process within the mine, the water subsequently being released into the river, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Activities of the radium isotopes were measured by ultra gamma spectrometry using a low background and high efficiency well type germanium detector whereas those of uranium were counted in an alpha spectrometer. The minimal, maximal and average values are reported here for each water source. The obtained results show that, unlike well waters, the thermal spring waters present relatively low U-238 activities and elevated Ra-226 activities and U-234/U-238 activity ratios. Uranium and radium activities are similar to those published for other non polluting regions of the world. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

We use gamma spectrometry for Ra-226 and Ac-228, and for Po-210 we use alpha spectrometry in association with a hydrochloric acid based radiochemical method for the extraction of Po-210. Using Po-209 to monitor polonium. extraction from samples we find the concentrations of Po-210, Ra-226 and Ac-228 in river sediments to be in accord with typical background values (similar to 0.04 Bq g(-1) dry), while for sub-surface soils located nearby we find the respective activity concentrations to accord with low background values (similar to 0.02 Bq g(-1) dry). For alluvial material from the site of a defunct minerals benefications plant we have found Po-210 concentrations of similar to 11 Bq g(-1) (dry) in two of three samples and 30 Bqg(-1) (dry) in the remaining sample; 226Ra and Ac-228 were some several times these concentrations. In support of the methods we have adopted in present evaluations we find IAEA-300 Baltic Sea sediment reference material to contain Po-210 concentrations that are within the IAEA confidence interval for this material.

This environment was selected for a radioactivity study because natural and artificial radionuclides can be transferred into the pulp mills, associated with raw material, wood and barks, where they are concentrated by industrial processes, becoming a cause of doses. Radionuclide concentration of natural radionuclides (U-238, U-234, Th-228, Th-230, Th-232) were determined by alpha- and gamma-spectrometry. Well-established radiochemical procedures were applied to environmental samples in order to isolate these radionuclides. A comparison between Th-228 activity, determined by gamma-spectrometry, and Th-232 activity, determined by alpha-spectrometry, was used as quality control parameter for analyses. The concentration factors were finally evaluated from experimental data. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The main objective was to characterize the ceramic paste, as well as the superficial layer of the ceramic fragments, in order to get qualitative information about the pigment composition of the plastic decoration. Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) methodology was employed to obtain the ceramic paste composition, as well as the superficial layer of the ceramic fragments. The experimental set-up consisted of 238Pu, 55Fe and 109Cd radioactive sources, a X-ray tube (at 15 kV, 40 mA, Me target and Zr filter), a Si(Li) detector (30 min(2), with a Be window) and a multichannel analyzer. X-ray spectra were analyzed using the AXIL program. A program based on the graphic polygonal representation method was developed and used to correlate the representative intensity data of each fragment. A low Ca content and a systematic presence of relatively high concentrations of Fe can characterize the ceramic pastes. Ti and Zr are also always present at high levels, and Ni, Cu and in some cases Zn at level of traces; Rb, Sr, Ba and Y are also present at low concentration. The black pigment in the pottery plastic decoration is due to the presence of Mn, the red pigment is due to the presence of Fe, while the white pigment is characterized by the presence of Ba. For the eleven fragments studied, the polygonal representation method points that the same materials were employed in the pottery production, and the pigments in the plastic decoration were obtained from different inorganic materials.

Studies (Goldemberg and Johansson (Eds.), Energy as an Instrument for Socio-Economic Development United Nations Development Programme, New York, 1995, p. 9; United Nations Statistical Yearbooks, 10th issue; 1965; 20th issue; 1975, 22nd issue, 1977; 32nd issue, 1987; and 39th issue 1994, United Nations Publications; Sheffield, J. Technol. Forecasting Social Change 59 (1998) 55.) show that, historically, the population growth rate has varied inversely as the annual per capita energy use in most parts of the developing world, where per capita energy use is typically less than 1 t of oil equivalent energy per year. However, in areas with more than 2-3 t of oil equivalent of energy use per year per person, the growth rate is around zero. If this trend continues, a stable world population will require, allowing for energy efficiency improvements, some 2-3 times the present annual energy use. There is an abundance of energy in the world both exploited and potential to meet this need - fossil, fission, and renewables - but it is not evenly distributed, some are costly, and there are issues of environmental pollution in present use, that may limit use. Fusion energy is a potential longer-term source with attractive environmental features. It is the least-developed energy option and still faces a challenging development path, but there are many areas of the world that would benefit hugely from its deployment from the later part of the 21st century onward, and it is important to consider how it might be deployed. Most fusion power plant options considered today show an economy of scale, owing to the fixed distance needed for shielding fusion neutrons, tritium breeding and handling the heat loads. One interesting approach is to use the power plant to co-produce electricity and hydrogen to facilitate the introduction of lower cost of electricity, multi-gigawatt power plants (Sheffield et al., A study of options for the deployment of large fusion power plants, 2000, to be published).

In addition, improvements were made to ARWEN in order to work properly with the RT code, and to make it user-friendlier, including new treatment of Equations of State, and graphical tools for visualization. The evaluation of the code has been performed, comparing it with other existing RT codes (including the one used in DAFNE, but in the single-grid version). These comparisons consist in problems with real input parameters (mainly opacities and geometry parameters). Important advances in Atomic Physics, Opacity calculations and NLTE atomic physics calculations, with participation in significant experiments in this area, have been obtained, Early published calculations showed that a DT, fuel with a small tritium initial content (x < 3%) could work in a catalytic regime in Inertial Fusion Targets, at very high burning temperatures (much greater than 100 keV). Otherwise, the cross-section of DT remains much higher than that of DD and no internal breeding of tritium can take place, improvements in the calculation model allow to properly simulate the effect of inverse Compton scattering which tends to lower T-e and to enhance radiation losses, reducing the plasma temperature, T-i. The neutron activation of all natural elements in First Structural Wall (FSW) component of an Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE) reactor for waste management, and the analysis of activation of target debris in NIF-type facilities has been completed. Using an original efficient modeling for pulse activation, the FSW behavior in inertial fusion has been studied. A radiological dose library coupled to the ACAB code is being generated for assessing impact of environmental releases, and atmospheric dispersion analysis from HIF reactors indicate the uncertainty in tritium release parameters. The first recognition of recombination barriers in SiC, modify the understanding of the calculation of displacement per atom, dpa, to quantify the collisional damage. An important analysis has been the confirmation, using Molecular Dynamics (MD) with an astonishing agreement, of the experimental evidence of low-temperature amorphization by damage accumulation in SiC, which could modify extensively its viability as a candidate material for IFE (fusion in general) applications. The radiation damage pulse effect has also been assessed using MD and Kinetic Monte Carlo diffusion of defects, showing the dose and driver frequency dependences. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The "Target Factory" at an inertial fusion power plant must produce about 500,000 targets per day, fill them with deuterium-tritium fuel, cool them to cryogenic temperature, and layer the solid fuel into a symmetric and smooth shell inside the capsule. The target must then accurately be delivered to the target chamber center at a rate of about 5 Hz, with a precisely predicted target location. These fragile targets must survive injection into the target chamber without damage. While IFE power plant design studies have presented plausible scenarios for IFE target fabrication and injection, these issues have become "believability" issues for IFE, A credible pathway for development of accurate, economic and reliable IFE target fabrication and injection must be demonstrated before we can proceed with the next major step in the IFE Program, the construction of an IFE Integrated Research Experiment. General Atomics is designing, constructing, and testing an experimental Target Injection and Tracking System to develop the scientific understanding necessary for injection of IFE targets into a high temperature reaction chamber. This paper summarizes the requirements for IFE target fabrication and injection, reviews the results from the studies that predict success, discusses the development program now underway, and presents the current status of and results from that program.

The cylindrical magnetized targets and the charge-compensating beams are considered. The unique values of the specific power for the ignition beams J(m) similar to 1 x 10(8) TW/g and the ignition beam energy E-ign similar to 60 MJ are employed to obtain a wave of the thermonuclear burning in a cylindrical magnetized channel. (The fuel was considered as a mixture (D0.9He0.1)-He-3 and the Pt ions energy-as epsilon (i) similar to 200-300 GeV.) A DT-tablet was also considered for ignition of the advanced fuel.

To attain an MTF ignition state, the deuterium-tritium fuel must be compressed in the regime of self-sustained magnetized implosion (SSMI). We analyze the general conditions and optimal parameter values required for initiating such a regime, and demonstrate that the SSMI regime can already be realized in cylindrical implosions driven by similar to 100 kJ beams of fast ions.

In this model the protons are treated as classical point-particles, whereas the electrons are represented by antisymmetrized wavepackets following a pseudo-hamiltonian dynamics. For the simulations we use 512 particles in a periodically continued cubic box. The equation of state, i.e. the pressure p as function of the temperature T for an electron density n = 2 x 10(29) m(-3) is rather Bat around 12,000 K. In this regime the molecules dissociate. The linear mixing model shows at lower absolute values a more pronounced behaviour of the pressure. The new path integral Monte Carlo results for T > 10,000 K show a similar Battening, while the tight-binding model shows hardly any. A comparison of our WPMD results with experiments for p(n) at T = 300 K shows the importance of antisymmetrization, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Conservations associated with these traditional analyses can mask the actual behavior of the plant and have revealed the need for more accurate modeling and analysis of accident conditions and radioactivity mobilization mechanisms. In the present work, computer codes traditionally used for magnetic fusion safety analyses (CHEMCON, MELCOR) have been applied for simulating accident conditions in a simple model of the HYLIFE-II IFE design. Here we consider a severe loss of coolant accident (LOCA) in conjunction with simultaneous failures of the beam tubes (providing a pathway for radioactivity release from the vacuum vessel towards the confinement) and of the two barriers surrounding the chamber (inner shielding and confinement building itself). Even though confinement failure would be a very unlikely event it would be needed in order to produce significant off-site doses. CHEMCON code allows calculation of long-term temperature transients in fusion reactor first wall, blanket, and shield structures resulting from decay heating. MELCOR is used to simulate a wide range of physical phenomena including thermal-hydraulics, heat transfer, aerosol physics and fusion product transport and release. The results of these calculations show that the estimated off-site dose is less than 5 mSv (0.5 rem), which is well below the value of 10 mSv (1 rem) given by the DOE Fusion Safety Standards for protection of the public from exposure to radiation during off-normal conditions.

A European study group (HIDIF collaboration) investigated the feasibility of a driver facility based on a linac and storage ring approach (Hofmann and Plass (Eds.), GSI-98-06 GEP, Darmstadt, 1998). In a preinjector consisting of an array of ion sources, rf-linacs and funnel devices a 400 mA Bi+ beam is formed, which is further accelerated in a main linac from about 2 GeV to its final energy of 10 GeV and then injected into the rings for storage and pulse compression. The most important requirements for the beam dynamics layout of this high intensity heavy ion linac are transmission rates of nearly 100% and very low emittance growth to avoid particle losses along the linac and at ring injection which may cause radioactivation of the structures. A particle dynamics design of an Alvarez type drift tube linac (DTL) has been successfully carried out with respect to high stability of the beam against errors and mismatch, which was checked by multiparticle simulations. Statistical errors of rf field amplitude and phase and quadrupole gradients were taken into account as well as current fluctuations, initial mismatch modes and changes of particle input distributions and combinations of different errors. Results of Monte Carlo simulations with up to 20,000 particles show a smooth behaviour of the beam and small halo development only. In addition the "telescoping" option, where three different ion species are accelerated, and the necessary modifications for the linac, have been investigated. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

These occur, e.g., through the formation of a halo around the core of the beam containing particles which will eventually collide with the walls of the accelerator pipe. The sum of the applied focusing fields and the intense self-fields produced by the beam charge are nonlinear near the surface of the beam causing instabilities leading to halo formation. Here, we investigate with the help of molecular dynamics computer simulations whether hard Coulomb collisions between the beam particles act as an additional cause for a beam halo. However, for the parameters of the high intensity linacs presently in discussion the beam particles remain sufficiently weakly correlated and intra beam scattering plays no major role in halo formation.

This project is based on the Accelerator-driven Transmutation of Waste (ATW) program developed during the 1990s at Los Alamos National Laboratory. and has its technological roots in several technologies that have been developed by the multi-mission laboratories of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). In the Fiscal Year 1999 Energy and Water Appropriation Act. the U.S. Congress directed the DOE to study ATW and by the end of FY99 to prepare a "roadmap" for developing this technology. DOE convened a steering committee. assembled four technical working groups consisting of members from many national laboratories. and consulted with several individual international and national experts. The finished product. "A Roadmap for Developing ATW Technology A Report to Congress," recommends a five-year $281 M. science-based, technical-risk-reduction program. This paper provides an overview of the U.S. Roadmap for developing ATW technology. the organization of the national ATW Project, the critical issues in subsystems and technological options, deployment scenarios. institutional challenges, and academic and international collaboration.
