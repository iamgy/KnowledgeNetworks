Vac. Sci. Technol. A 5 (4) (1987) 2311] and by Waelbroeck et al. [Forschungazentrum, Julich, Germany, Jul-1996, 1984] has been developed. An improved analytical expression for the plasma-driven tritium permeation in the steady state is presented. Using the presented analytical expression, the influence of surface conditions on the front and the back sides of a metal has been considered for the plasma-driven permeation of tritium through both endothermic and exothermic metals. The presented pictures allow us to define the steady-state tritium permeation in a wide range of the surface conditions: as for an absolutely clean surface and a bare (presence of small amounts of impurities) surface as for contaminated with different impurities surface. This result can be useful for choosing the plasma-facing material for the future steady-state fusion device. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Samples simulating a co-deposited layer were prepared by glow discharge using C2H2 and a tungsten or CFC substrate. The UV light from a xenon excimer lump (172 MI) was irradiated to the samples in 423 K. Small amounts of species were released only by the heating procedure to 423 K. By UV irradiation, large quantities of hydrogen, carbon and hydrocarbons were released from the samples. Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) analysis showed hydrocarbons were formed on the sample by acetylene glow discharge and C-H bonds were decomposed by irradiation with UV light. It is concluded that the combination of heating and UV irradiation causes release of tritium from the surface of the materials. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Limiter tiles in use for 14 100 s of plasma operation were dismounted for examination with surface analysis and microscopy methods. Mapping of the deuterium distribution by means of nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) revealed the presence of deposition zones covering about 35% of the tiles'surface area. Besides C and D, other constituents of the layers were boron, silicon and inconel components. The co-deposit, with a stratified structure and a thickness of up to 50 mum, could be detached from the tiles. Deuterium depth profiling on both sides of the detached flakes and in the underlying graphite substrate enabled the D content in the deposition zones to be estimated at a level of 3.5 x 10(19) cm(-2). Adding the fuel content found in the erosion zone (3-7 x 10(17) cm(-2)) and on the back side of the tile (0.9-1.8 x 10(17) cm(-2)), the total amount of D atoms trapped in all the limiter tiles was assessed to be about 2 x 10(23) atoms. D content in the co-deposits accounted for approximately 10 at.% (C-D/C-C similar to 0.1) which was considered to be low in comparison to much greater values observed in other devices. The results of the ion beam analyses (IBA) agree well with the determination by thermal desorption spectrometry (TDS). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This is a clear demonstration that the target materials and temperatures modify the boundary plasma. In addition the intensity ratio D beta /D alpha is not simply a function of plasma temperature but has clear target temperature dependence. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The partial pressures of H-2, HD, C and CO2 during the UV exposure were enhanced more than twice, compared to the partial pressures before UV exposure. In comparison, the amount of O-2 decreased during the UV exposure and the production of a small amount of O-3 was observed when the UV light was turned on. Unlike the decontamination method of baking in air or oxygen, the UV exposure removed hydrogen isotopes from the tile to vacuum predominantly in forms of gases of hydrogen isotopes. The tritium surface contamination on the tile in the area exposed to the UV light was reduced after the UV exposure. The results show that the UV light with a wavelength of 172 nm can remove hydrogen isotopes from carbon-based tiles at the very surface. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Tiles, flakes, wall coupons, a stainless steel shutter and dust samples have been retrieved from the TFTR vessel for analysis. Selected samples have been baked to release tritium and assay the tritium content, The in-vessel tritium inventory is estimated to be 0.56 g and is consistent with the in-vessel tritium inventory derived from the difference between tritium fueling and tritium exhaust. The distribution of tritium on the limiter and vessel wall showed complex patterns of co-deposition, Relatively high concentrations of tritium were found at the top and bottom of the bumper limiter, as predicted by earlier BBQ modeling.

After about 2.5 years of JET operation, including the extended D/T phase and the D/D cleaning phase, the samples have been removed and analysed by RES, ERDA and AMS. In the near surface region only small T concentrations are measured. A much larger T concentration is found at depths between about 1 and 2 mum. This may originate from energetic (similar to1 MeV)T which is produced during the D/D discharges and implanted to large depth. The lower energy (keV) T which is implanted during the D/T discharges became effectively removed from the inner wall, by isotope exchange with implanted D or H and/or by erosion of the wall. The total amount of T within a depth of about 2 mum was found to be about 1-3 x 10(13) T/cm(2), while in a surface layer of about 0.5 mum about 1-3 x 10(12) T/cm(2), about 2-4 x 10(16) D/cm(2) and about 4-9 x 10(16) H/cm(2) were measured.

Investigation of techniques to reduce this effect is hampered by the difficulty in making measurements. Current methods rely on analysis of samples removed from machines after venting to atmosphere (J.P. Goad, et al., J. Nucl. Mater. 226 (1995) 156). Conclusions have, therefore, been drawn on a global basis, since it is not possible to assess the effects of individual plasma configurations. Detailed studies require a more prompt means of measuring the hydrogen content of samples, ideally on a shot-by-shot basis and without the necessity of breaking the machine vacuum (A. Huber, et al., this Conference). A new technique is described that meets these criteria and has been demonstrated at JET. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

The surface densities of deuterium on the sample materials, which were continuously irradiated by atomic deuterium particles, were measured by the nuclear reaction analysis (NRA). As a result, for each sample, the amount of reflected deuterium decreased with increasing the sample temperature and temperature dependence of the amount was very similar to that of the surface density of deuterium. This would be explained by the fact that atomic hydrogen is reflected as being atoms with a significant probability on hydrogen-covered surface but not reflected on hydrogen-free surface.

Samples of 99.95% tungsten provided by Plansee Aktiengesellschaft were exposed to 100 eV deuterium and tritium ions at a range of fluxes from 2.3 x 10(17) to 1.3 x 10(18) ions/cm(2) s for one hour at 623 K in the tritium plasma experiment. The samples were outgassed to determine the amount of retained hydrogen isotopes. The retention scaled at slightly greater than the square root of the fluence. The fractional retention was on the order of 10(-5). The data from these experiments were combined with previous results to construct a comprehensive model of the migration and retention behavior for hydrogen in tungsten, A second set of experiments involved exposing 99.95% tungsten foils provided by AESAR to 100 eV deuterons at a flux of 6 x 10(17) D/cm(2) s for 30 min at 423 and 373 K, Scanning Electron Microscopy analysis was performed on the samples to determine the effects of the plasma exposure, Unannealed samples revealed extensive blistering with many blister caps removed. Samples annealed to 1473 K showed minor blistering, and samples annealed to 1273 K showed no blistering, The SEM analysis was used in conjunction with the retention results to understand the role of annealing and defects in trapping within the tungsten.

Their origin is due to plasma-surface interactions. Dust particles may contain significant amounts of hydrogen isotopes, 50% of which will be Tritium in future devices. The radioactive decay of Tritium incorporated into carbonaceous dust may lead to its charging and to the formation of a nuclear induced plasma associated with levitation and transport of dust inside the vacuum vessel. We will discuss the experimental evidence of dust levitation and removal by appropriately shaped electric fields and we will discuss some aspects of radioactive dust in fusion devices.

Two new high resolution detectors have been installed on the Alcator C-Mod tokamak to measure the neutral density and ionization rate near the edge of the discharge in the main chamber. The detectors consist of a 20 channel photodiode array which views the plasma tangentially 12.5 cm below the outer midplane, and 10 cm above the inner midplane, with a nominal radial resolution of 2 and 3 mm, respectively. The spectral bandwidth is limited by a filter with a very narrow band around the neutral deuterium Lyman alpha wavelength (1215 Angstrom), The local emissivity is then obtained via a standard Abel inversion of the absolutely calibrated brightness profile, Employing well-known branching ratios, and using measured local electron density and temperature, we therefore, infer the neutral density and ionization rate with similar radial resolution. We have observed that both Lyman alpha emissivity and ionization rate are usually peaked near the separatrix with a full width, half-maximum between 1 and 2 cm, The neutral density was found to drop rapidly with decreasing minor radius, from 2-3 x 10(17)/m(3) (5-10 mm outside the separatrix) to 1-2 x 10(16)/m(3) (5-10 mm inside the separatrix) for a line averaged density of 2.0 x 10(20)/m(3), Variations in ionization rate and neutral density from low to high confinement mode (L and H mode) are also discussed.

A multi-variable fit procedure is used to minimise the differences between code predictions of plasma quantities and the experimental measurements of these same quantities by varying input parameters to the code (e.g., the radial heat diffusivity, the radial particle diffusivity, the fractional amount of neutrals pumped), a number of ASDEX-Upgrade (AUG) shots have now been analysed, and a preliminary analysis of the resulting database performed. Regression analysis suggests a strong improvement of heat transport with increasing plasma current, and moderate degradation with increasing density and heating power. Separate regressions for hydrogen and deuterium discharges suggest differences in the scalings of the transport. Work has now started on fitting both a diffusivity and an inward pinch for the particle transport. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V, All rights reserved.

The corresponding L-H transition shows well-known features such as the steepening of the temperature and density profiles in the region of the separatrix, With a so-called sniffer probe the temporal development of the hydrogen and deuterium fluxes has been studied in the plasma edge during different I-I-mode discharges with deuterium gas puffing. Prior to the transition a significant reduction of the deuterium and also the hydrogen fluxes can be observed. This fact confirms the assumption that the steepening of the density profiles starts at the outermost edge of the plasma. Moreover, sniffer probe measurements in the plasma edge could therefore identify a precursor for the L-H transition. The analysis of the hydrogen neutral gases shows a distinct change of the hydrogen isotope ratio during the transition. This observation is in agreement with the change in the particle fluxes onto the targets and can also be seen in the reduced H-alpha signals from the limiters. It is further demonstrated that significant improvement in the time resolution of the measured data can be obtained by deconvolution of the data with the apparatus function using Bayesian probability theory and the Maximum Entropy method with adaptive kernels.

The stabilization of the MARFE opened a possibility to investigate this phenomenon in detail on a longer time scale. The population densities of excited state of deuterium in the MARFE were estimated from Balmer series line emission. The spectrum of the continuum radiation from the MARFE core has been measured in the spectral range 450-740 nm. The plasma parameters T-e= 1.1-1.5 eV and n(e) = 2 x 10(20)-2.1 x 10(20) m(-3) have been estimated from the measurements of the Balmer line emission, Balmer line Stark broadening and continuum radiation.

In ohmic and H-mode discharges larger compression ratios and enrichment factors as competed to divertor I have been found. With the new divertor configuration both quantities depend on the heating power and deteriorate with divertor detachment. In ITB-discharges with an I-I-mode edge, helium exhaust is rather slow - as expected for such low density scenarios - but not hindered by the transport barrier. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this payer, we analyze the energy flux deposition on neutralizer plates as measured by infrared cameras and Langmuir probes. Three important features will be discussed: (1) The energy deposition during helium shots is as much as twice that for deuterium shots, for a given input power level. (2) The sheath heat transmission factor, deduced experimentally by comparison between probes and infrared measurements, increases with input power independently of the working gas from similar to7.5 (P-TOT = 1 MW) to similar to 10-11 for P-TOT = 5 MW) In ohmic discharges, the standard value of 7 is recovered except specific cases in helium where gamma can decrease to 2 or 3. (3) These anomalous values put in doubt the validity of edge temperature measurements by Langmuir probes iu detached plasmas and have led to the development of a promising 'infrared' degree of detachment (Dod).

(Helium compression is the ratio of the helium density in the pumping plenum to the helium density in the plasma; helium enrichment is the ratio of the helium compression to the hydrogen or deuterium compression.) In this work the B2-EIRENE code is used to model helium compression and enrichment on ASDEX Upgrade with divertor II under a variety of plasma densities, input powers, transport coefficients and divertor geometries so as to determine the range of acceptable operating conditions for effective He removal. A broad range of acceptable plasma conditions is found, though a lower limit of the upstream separatrix density is noted. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Line profiles are analysed with a synthetic profile method taking into account Zeeman and Doppler effects. This analysis shows that two deuterium populations with specific behaviours have to be considered: the first one (cold atoms) is composed of atomic deuterium coming from D-2 desorbed from the NP, while the second one (warm atoms) is composed of charge exchange (CX) and reflected D. The Doppler temperature of cold atoms increases with the edge electron density, n(e)(edge) (1.4 eV < T-D(c) < 2.5 eV). Possible causes for this behaviour are analysed; in particular, the possible heating of cold atoms by Df ions is evaluated. On the other hand, the Doppler temperature of warm atoms is not influenced by edge parameter variations (T-D(w) similar to 22 eV).

The divertor-characteristic quantities of noble gas compression and enrichment have been experimentally inferred from Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy measurements in the core plasma, and from spectroscopic analysis of a Penning gauge discharge in the exhaust gas. The retention of helium was found to be satisfactory for a next-step device, with enrichment factors exceeding 0.1. The helium enrichment decreases with increasing core plasma density, while the neon enrichment has the opposite behaviour, Analytic and numerical analyses of these plasmas using the divertor impurity code package DIVIMP/NIMBUS support the explanation that the enrichment of noble gases depends significantly on the penetration depth of the impurity neutrals with respect to the fuel atoms. Changes of the divertor plasma configuration and divertor geometry have no effect on the enrichment. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Earlier we reported on the existence of narrow power deposition profiles in JET, obtained mainly from Langmuir probe measurements. We repeated these measurements in the MkI, MkII and MkIIGB divertor configurations with an upgraded probe system, which allowed us to study the profile shape in more detail. The main results of this study are: In NB heated discharges the electron temperature and power flux at the outer target show a distinct peak of similar to5 mm half-width near the separatrix strike point. The corresponding profiles on the inner target do not show a similar feature. The height of the narrow peak increases with NE heating power and decreases with deuterium and impurity gas puffing. Ion orbit losses are suggested as a possible explanation of the observed profile shape. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The contribution is restricted to deuterium fuelled ohmic plasmas for which the CB drift is directed away from the X-point of lower single-null, open diverted equilibria with fixed elongation and triangularity. Unlike more conventional diverted equilibria, however, the configurations described are characterised by both a very short divertor poloidal depth on a vertical target and a very long poloidal depth on a horizontal target. Results are presented from density ramp discharges in which the outer (high poloidal depth) divertor is already in the high recycling regime at the start of the density ramp and in which varying degrees of detachment are obtained depending on the magnitude of the imposed outer divertor flux expansion. In contrast, the inner divertor remains in the large Dart attached for all densities. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

After the modification, the pumping rate was remarkably improved with both-leg pumping in a divertor-closure configuration, which means both separatrixes close to the divertor slots. In steady state, efficient helium exhaust was realized in a divertor-closure configuration with both-leg pumping in ELMy H-mode plasmas. A global particle confinement time of tau*(He) = 0.4 s and tau*(He)/tau (E) = 3 was achieved in attached plasmas, well within the range generally considered necessary for successful operation of a future fusion reactor, such as ITER-FEAT. The helium exhaust efficiency in the divertor-closure configuration was extended by 45% as compared to the one with inner-leg pumping. In the high X-point configuration with both-leg pumping, the helium exhaust efficiency and the pumping rate of deuterium deteriorated because of the backflow through the outer slot.

Potentially, methane pulling quantifies the SOL processes governing the intrinsic carbon, its penetration to the plasma core, and its removal to the divertor. We measured the perturbations to the core and the SOL plasmas as a function of CD4 and D-2 injection rates. The deduced screening was independent of the methane injection rate indicating that the methane itself did not significantly perturb the deduced screening. Identification of appropriate reference plasmas is important, For JET L-Modes, the reference plasma should have enough deuterium puffing to achieve the same density as that which occurred with the methane. The screening results are susceptible to systematic errors in the visible and charge exchange determination of the core carbon density. For JET, these two measurements yield screening values that differ by a 'factor-of-three'. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

For the simulation of ITER normal operation conditions in combination with plasma disruptions samples of various types of tungsten were exposed to both steady-state and high power pulsed deuterium plasmas. Tungsten samples were first exposed in a steady-state plasma with an ion current density similar to 10(21) m(-2) s(-1) up to a dose of 10(25) m(-2) at a temperature of 770 K. The energy of deuterium ions was 150 eV. The additional exposure of the samples to 10 pulses of deuterium plasma was performed in the electrodynamical plasma accelerator with an energy flux 0.45 MJ/m(2) per pulse. Samples of four types of tungsten (W-1%La2O3, W-13I, monocrystalline W(111) and W-10%Re) were investigated. The least destruction of the surface was observed for W(1 1 1). The concentration of retained deuterium in tungsten decreased from 2.5 x 10(19) m(-2) to 1.07 x 10(19) m(-2) (for W(1 1 1)) as a result of the additional pulsed plasma irradiation.

Experimentally it was found, that the appearance of MARFEs [B. Lipschultz, J. Nucl. Mater. 145-147 (1987) 15] inhibited an increase of the density significantly above the so-called Greenwald density (n(GW)) [M. Greenwald et al., Nucl. Fus. 28 (1988) 2199]. In TEXTOR-94 the onset of MARFEs has been investigated under different wall conditions. With fresh siliconization and fresh boronization the appearance of MARFEs can be postponed to higher densities (N-GW = (n) over bar (e/)n(GW) = 1.7). At those high densities (n) over bar (e) = 8 x 10(19) m(-3) the Z(eff) is reduced to 1.3. But as important as the reduction of the global impurity content is the suppressed carbon release on the high-field-side (HFS) just after wall conditioning, Modeling of the MARFE onset by the codes B2-Eirene and TECXY demonstrates that an instability on the HFS due to deuterium recycling and radiation only leads to the formation of MARFEs at higher line-averaged densities in comparison to calculations which include carbon impurities. Complete suppression of MARFEs has been achieved by controlled displacement of the plasma column to the low-field-side (LFS), which reduces the local recycling and impurity release at the inner bumper limiter. This resulted in the highest densities achieved at TEXTOR-94 of N-GW = 2.1 independent of wall conditions. In this case the maximum achievable density is limited by a radiative collapse.

We report on the results of layer deposition using methane plasmas as a systematic case study for future boron or silicon deposition by other gases (B2H6, SiH4). The produced coatings can be characterized as polymer-like soft a-C:D-films with a high DIG-ratio due to the low energy of particles hitting the wall. Neutral hydrocarbon radicals could be identified to play the major role for film deposition. On the other hand, strong re-erosion induced by deuterium ions is observed in regions with plasma-wall contact. The spatial homogeneity and the characteristics of produced coatings are presented and observations are correlated with measured plasma parameters. The use of pulsed plasmas for wall conditioning is compared with steady-state discharges, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Indeed, gamma -rays, alpha and beta particles due to the incorporated actinides or fission products will certainly produce several effects, particularly structural and chemical modifications, in the host material. In order to investigate these effects. powdered samples were irradiated with 1.5 Gy dose of gamma -rays. The formation of PO32- and POO. free radicals was detected using electron spin resonance (ESR) and thermoluminescence (TL) methods. These free radicals do not modify the macroscopic properties of the TPD and disappear when the sample is heated at 400 degreesC. The implantation of He+ ions of 1.6 MeV (fluence: 10(16) particles cm(-2)) and Au3+ ions of 5 MeV (fluence 4 x 10(15) particles cm(-2)) causes some damages on the surface of sintered samples. Amorphization and chemical decomposition of the matrix were observed for the dose of 10(15) particles cm(-2) and higher when irradiated with Pb2+ (200 keV) and Au3+ (5 MeV) ion beams. These effects were evidenced by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The dissolution tests were conducted at 20-75 degreesC with initial pHs from 2 to 12 and flow rates from 10 to 80 mi d(-1) in the open atmosphere. The U releases from these titanate materials are controlled by initial fast process and then followed by linear kinetics. The close-to-stoichiometric U release from zirconolite and pyrochlore-rich materials and preferential U release from brannerite are consistent with the alterations observed for the natural samples. The rate constants for U releases were determined and the effects of pH and temperature were examined. For each material, the U release vs. pH exhibits a V-shape with a minimum near pH 8. The measured activation energies suggest surface reaction controlled dissolution mechanism. Pyrochlore-rich materials and zirconolite demonstrated higher chemical durability and more resistance to aqueous attack than brannerite. However, impurities and minor brannerite inclusions do not appear to have a detrimental effect on U releases from pyrochlor-erich multi-phase ceramics. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The GOMs were 1.968, 1.940 and 1.914 for 3, 6 and 10 mol% Mg, respectively. There seemed to be no temperature dependence of GOM. As the oxygen partial pressure, p(O2), decreases, a part of the magnesium atoms rearrange from the substitutional 4a sites of Fm (3) over barm to the interstitial 4b sites as shown by density measurements, during which the magnesium solubility decreases from y = 1/3 to the minimum (<0.06) at around p(O2) 10(-3) Pa. However, at p(O2) = 10(-8) Pa, the solubility again increases to >0.1. The ratio of interstitial magnesium to total magnesium was near 0.5 at 3-5 mol% Mg at GOM. The change rates of lattice parameter were found to be partial derivativea/partial derivativex = -0.101 Angstrom, partial derivativea/partial derivativey = +0.290 Angstrom for interstitial magnesium and partial derivativea/partial derivativez = -0.187 Angstrom.

This magnetite usually accumulates radioactivity during reactor operation. The dissolution of the host magnetite is achieved by chemical formulations in order to get rid of the radioactivity trapped in the oxide: the underlying base metal also participates in the process by contributing electron to reduce the ferric ion or by undergoing corrosion. In the present study, the role of base metal in the dissolution of magnetite in various chelating agents has been investigated. The liberated hydrogen was measured by using an amperometric hydrogen sensor. The magnetite dissolution rate and the corrosion rate of carbon steel in the formulations were calculated. The effect of temperature, pH and concentration of the chelating agents on the magnetite film dissolution was studied in detail. The mechanism of base metal aided magnetite dissolution is discussed.

J	Kizu, K; Pisarev, A; Tanabe, T				Kizu, K; Pisarev, A; Tanabe, T			Co-permeation of deuterium and hydrogen through Pd	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							LITHIUM LEAD ALLOY; PALLADIUM MEMBRANE; ISOTOPES; SURFACES; TRITIUM; ABSTRACTION; RELEASE; ATOMS; IRRADIATION; DESORPTION	Experiments on permeation of deuterium through a palladium membrane, which was accompanied by co-permeation of hydrogen, were performed in the pressure range below 1 Pa. Permeation of deuterium exhibited features of surface limited regime (SLR) both with and without hydrogen co-existence. Release of D-2, HD, and H-2 molecules from the downstream side of the membrane was observed in presence of hydrogen. No visible blocking of deuterium permeation by hydrogen appeared. The net permeation rate of deuterons in D-2 and HD forms in the co-permeation experiments with hydrogen was found to be approximately the same as in the experiments without hydrogen, if the effective deuterium pressure p(D-2) + p(HD)/2 remained the same irrespective of the partial pressure of hydrogen p(H-2). The experimental data were described by a steady-state permeation model, which took into account D-2, HD, and H-2 absorption and desorption. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

One could easily obtain fine Li2TiO3 powders from the solution through drying and calcination. Li2TiO3 pebbles (size similar to0.6 mm, above 90% TD) were obtained from the 'reprocessed' powders. These solutions were also suitable for the formation of a sol emulsion in 2-ethyl-hexanol-1, from which gelled microspheres of lithium titanate could be obtained. Locally prepared Li2TiO3 reprocessed and supplied pebble batches were tested for tritium release by temperature programmed desorption (TPD) methods in He + 0.1%H-2 (R-gas) after their short irradiations in a thermal neutron flux. The relative TPD data were compared. A qualitative correlation was developed between peak characteristics and pebble microstructure. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V, All rights reserved.

The thermal diffusivity of epsilon -phase Zr hydrides increased with increasing hydrogen concentration and decreased with increasing temperature. The thermal diffusivities of epsilon -phase ZrHx with x > 1.83 were larger than that of alpha -phase Zr. The experimental data on the thermal diffusivity were expressed with the equations as a function of temperature and composition. Moreover, the thermal conductivities of epsilon -phase Zr hydrides were estimated from the measured data of the thermal diffusivity and the reported data of the density and specific heat. It was found that the epsilon -phase Zr hydrides were better thermal conductors than alpha -phase Zr and delta -phase Zr hydrides. The thermal diffusivity and conductivity of U-ZrHx were also estimated with the ones of ZrHx and U. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The systems are intended to be applied to construction of work breakdown structures and estimation of manpower needs, worker doses, etc. based on the unit productivity and work difficulty factors, which were developed by analyzing the actual data on the JPDR dismantling activities. In addition, information necessary for project planning can be effectively integrated as a graphical form on a computer screen by transferring the data produced by subprograms such as radioactive inventory and dose rate calculation routines among the systems. Expert systems were adopted for modeling a new decommissioning project using production rules by reconstructing work breakdown structures and work specifications. As the results, the systems were characterized by effective modeling of a decommissioning project, project management data estimation based on feedback of past experience, and information integration through the graphical user interface. On the other hands. the systems were validated by comparing the calculated results with the actual manpower needs of the JPDR dismantling activities; it is expected that the systems will be applicable to planning and evaluation of other decommissioning projects.

The peak-detection efficiencies were precisely determined with some calibration gases. In order to obtain more reliable efficiency curves from the limited data of calibration gases, an interpolation technique using a multi-gamma point source was applied. And also, the feasibility of simple calibration with the point source located at an appropriate single position was discussed. As a result, the efficiencies obtained with the calibration gases show good agreement with the efficiency curves derived by the interpolation technique. The efficiencies also agreed with efficiency curves determined by the simple calibration within an error of 4%.

J	Burr, T; Stanbro, WD; Charlton, W				Burr, T; Stanbro, WD; Charlton, W			An evaluation of safeguards approaches for neptunium	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						systems analysis; alternate nuclear material; flow sheet verification; material balance accounting; neptunium; safeguards; evaluations		The International Atomic Energy Agency has recently drawn attention to the fact that neptunium (Np), a byproduct of the nuclear power industry, can be used to make nuclear weapons. Current monitoring approaches for Np do not rely on material balance accounting as is used for uranium and plutonium. In the future this may change. Although full material balance accounting is not anticipated for Np, it is informative to evaluate the impact and benefit of full material balance accounting when considering other options. Therefore, this paper will apply systems analysis to evaluate ways to convert the current system to full materials balance accounting that will minimize the intrusiveness of the verification system and minimize costs to both the facility operator and the inspection agency. We then compare full material balance accounting to partial material balance accounting and to a ratio-monitoring technique referred to as flow sheet verification. We conclude that sampling approximately 25% of the batches is likely to be adequate and that Pu (or perhaps Cs-137) will be the most effective surrogate for estimating the Np in the input accountability tank.

The brain regional radioactivities of Sc-46, Mn-54, Zn-65, Se-75, Rb-83 and Zr-88 were measured 48 hours after intraperitoneal injection of a solution in normal mice aged 6 to 52 weeks to evaluate the brain regional (corpus striatum, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and pens and medulla) uptakes. The radioactive distributions of Sc-46, Mn-54 and Zr-88 tracers were variable and region-specific in the brain, while those of Zn-65, Se-75 and Rb-83 tracers were comparable among all regions of interest. The brain regional uptakes of ail tracers slightly increased with age: from 10 to 28 weeks, and then remained constant during aging after 28 weeks. These uptake variations may be involved in the functional degenerative process of the blood-brain barrier during aging.

The optimum extraction conditions have been evaluated by studying various parameters such as pH, diluents, equilibration time and reagent concentration. PAHB forms yellow colored complex with uranium(VI) in the pH range of 3.5-4.6 which can be extracted by isobutyl methyl ketone. The extracted complex exhibits an absorption maximum at 375 nm. Beer's law was obeyed in the concentration range 1.0-5.6 ppm of uranium(VI). The nature of the extracted species (1:2) was determined by log D-log c plot. The proposed method permits selective separation of uranium(VI) from its binary mixtures. The method is also applied for the estimation of uranium in multicomponent mixtures and monazite sand.

J	LaBrecque, JJ; Rosales, PA; Cordoves, PR				LaBrecque, JJ; Rosales, PA; Cordoves, PR			Anomalously high values of cesium-137 in soils on the Peninsula de Paraguana (Venezuela)	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ENVIRONMENTAL-RADIOACTIVITY; CS-137	The activity of Cs-137 in surface soils (2-5 cm) was determined at twenty-one sampling sites along the northwestern and eastern coast of the Paraguana peninsula (Venezuela), as well as, at nine locations, between 95 and 535 m.a.s.l. on Cerro Santa Ana. The measurements were performed by high-resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy employing a compatible IBM computer. Most of the values were much higher than those found along the coastline of the mainland; four sites were found to be anomalously high, with Cs-137 values greater than 10 Bq/kg. It is difficult to explain these anomalous Cs-137 values by geographical or climatological factors since there is little rainfall here and the clouds and fog are rarely if never present along the coast of the peninsula. Possibly, some mechanism of the mist that is blown ashore could explain these anomalies. The values of the Cs-137 versus altitude on the Cerro Santa Ana show an increase of two or three times at 500 m.a.s.l. Level, thus we have concluded that the base of the clouds was at this height when the fallout was directly deposited by condensation in this cloud forest. These results in the Cerro Santa Ana cloud forest are similar to those of other cloud forests along the Venezuelan coast, but the altitude (m.a.s.l.) of the base of the clouds here are much lower.

J	Joshi, RM; Ravi, PM; Gurg, RP				Joshi, RM; Ravi, PM; Gurg, RP			Base line radioactivity levels in Kaiga site soil and its migration to biosphere	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								The effects of variation in different parameters on the environmental distribution of base line Cs-137 and K-40 activities in Kaiga environment and their migration into biosphere are discussed. Transfer factors of these radionuclides from soil to different parts of commonly available plants in this region were estimated. Base line radioactivity levels in soil at Kaiga were higher as compared to pre-operational values reported from other power station sites in India and were mainly attributed to the very high precipitation rate prevailing in this area. Also. this area being an undisturbed forest land, fallout activities are re-circulated to the soil by the decay of parts of trees. K-40 and Cs-137 activity levels in leaves of shallow rooted plants were found to be higher as compared to that in deep rooted trees. Transfer factors of soil to plant parts revealed that there is no major bio-accumulation of Cs-137 in any parts of Colocassia esculenta (L.) and Chromolaena odorata (L.) King & Robinson. Comparison of K-40/Cs-137 ratio between soil and different parts of these plants has revealed that uptake of K is relatively more efficient as compared to that of Cs, presumably because of the faster kinetics of K due to its larger atom inventory in the soil.

The code can be used on a personal computer. Almost all of the equipment in the reprocessing plant is included in the code and the mass balance model of equipment is based on the distribution factors of flow-out streams. Each model of equipment is connected between the outlet flow and the inlet flow according to the process flow sheet. We estimate the amount of DBP from TBP degradation in the entire process by using the developed code. The DBP concentration at the Pu refining process becomes the highest. which is generated from the TBP degradation caused by ct radiation from the extracted Pu in solvent. On the other hand, very little of DBP is generated in the U refining process. We therefore propose simplification of the solvent washing process and volume reduction of the alkali waste solution in the U refining process. We also analyzed the amount of DBP when high burnup UO2 fuels and LWR-MOX fuels are reprocessed. II is concluded that two times amount of DBP is generated during the high burnup UO2 fuels and LWR-MOX fuels reprocessing but this amount of DBP is not so much to affect the process performance.

An additional sintered silicon carbide (SSiC)-encasement of the UO2 pellets within the zircaloy cladding was planned. Various designs for the construction of the absorber rods were developed in order to achieve a failure temperature in excess of 1200 degreesC. At the RWTH Aachen, a series of depleted UO2 pellets were enclosed in gastight SSiC capsules through reaction sintering. The capsules were checked for leaks, and their thermomechanical behavior was analyzed after thermal strain; the capsules were heated to 1800 degreesC (maximally 2070 degreesC) in oxidizing water vapor as well as in air. Further series of experiments were conducted in order to examine the chemical behavior of the SSiC pellets in the presence of various reactor component materials at high temperatures. SSiC was heated to 1800 degreesC while in contact with the following substances: zircaloy, steel, cerium material, UO2, Ag-In-Cd-alloy, HfO2, Dy2O3, Gd2O3, Sm2O3, BN, and B4C. With the exception of steel and cerium material containing steel, the substances proved relatively inert in reactions with SSiC, such that their use in combination with SSiC can be judged to be favorable.

J	Lee, NY; Hwang, IS; Yoo, HI				Lee, NY; Hwang, IS; Yoo, HI			New leak detection technique using ceramic humidity sensor for water reactors	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								Leak-before-break (LBB) approach has been considered for its application to the main steam line (MSL) of Korean Next Generation Reactor (KNGR) - an advanced pressurized water reactor under development. Unlike the primary water leakage, the MSL leak detection must be based on principles other than radioactivity measurements. Among potential options that are being considered as indicators of leakage, it is believed that humidity at the proximity of the piping system is an effective one. A ceramic-based humidity sensor was developed, which can be qualified for LBB applications. The ceramic material, sintered and annealed MgCr2O4-TiO2, is shown to increase its electrical conductivity upon water vapor adsorption without any negative impact due to gamma radiation over the entire temperature range of interest. In the plant applications, the sensor array can be positioned in the annulus between the piping and surrounding insulation. By the analysis of humidity distribution in the annulus, a leak rate of 1 1 h(-1) can be detected within an hour when the distance between two adjacent sensors does not exceed 1 m. In order to minimize the number of signal wires, the use of AC impedance technique is shown to be advantageous. In this paper, the results of the development and the performance characterization of ceramic humidity sensor for the LBB application to the MSL of KNGR are summarized. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The method includes evaporation (concentration), calcination, and vitrification of high-level radioactive wastes in a one-stage process inside a melting converter for non-metallic minerals, followed by burial inside a bunker-storage facility located directly underneath a melting chamber. Specific to the melting process is the direct combustion of a gas-oxygen-air mixture inside a melt. The experimental data for different aspects of the proposed method are presented, including converter/bunker dimensions, burner types and sizes, data for used materials, contents of saturated salty solution and final glass product, and entrainment analysis. The effective flue-gases cleaning systems and the design of the burial-bunker storage facility are also discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Schlieck, M; Berger, HD; Neufert, A				Schlieck, M; Berger, HD; Neufert, A			Optimized gadolinia concepts for advanced in-core fuel management in PWRs	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								Utilities operating LWRs require fuel assemblies and in-core fuel management service, which ensure safe, flexible and cost-effective production of electricity. Because the reliability of the fuel has always been the most important requirement, advanced measures to minimize fuel cycle costs are receiving increasing attention in the light of the pressure on costs within the deregulated power generation markets. The role of in-core fuel management in supporting the goal to minimize fuel cycle costs consists in the development of more demanding core loading strategies, i.e, in the first place, more advanced low leakage loading patterns. A prerequisite for this type of loading pattern is the use of an optimized burnable absorber design. Gadolinia (Gd) as integrated burnable absorber is a very effective means for limiting the critical boron concentration and power peaking factors. Current development efforts for optimizing Gd-fuel are focused on the reduction of the inherent penalties of today's Gd-FA designs, i.e. reduced average fuel assembly (FA) enrichment and heavy metal content, as well as the residual reactivity binding. The most effective way to overcome these drawbacks is the reduction of the Gd2O3 concentration to values of approximate to 2 w/o, for which, according to recent measurements of the heat conductivity of modern Gd-fuels, the reduction of the fissile content in the Gd-rods is no longer necessary. Various feasibility studies have been performed to evaluate the consequences of FA designs with low Gd-concentrations (low-Gd designs) for Siemens PWRs and non-Siemens PWRs, for which more restrictive boundary conditions with respect to critical boron concentration and peaking factors have to be fulfilled. These studies, as well as operation experience of reactor cycles using low Gd-FA reload designs, confirm that the in-core fuel management can handle the different Gd burnout characteristics without problems. The economical benefits of low-Gd designs compared to conventional Gd designs are comparable to those achievable by distinctly more costly and complex alternatives, like the use of enriched gadolinia.

All 240 individual crystals painted with a special wavelength-shifting solution were examined in a custom-built detection apparatus (RASTA - radioactive source tomography apparatus) that uses a Cs-137 radioactive gamma source, cosmic muons and a light-emitting diode as complementary probes of the scintillator light response. We have extracted the total light output, axial light collection nonuniformities and timing responses of the individual CsI crystals. These results predict improved performance of the 3 pi sr PIBETA calorimeter due to the painted lateral surfaces of 240 CsI crystals. The wavelength-shifting paint treatment did not affect appreciably the total light output and timing resolution of our crystal sample. The predicted energy resolution for positrons and photons in the energy range of 10-100 MeV was nevertheless improved due to the more favorable axial light collection probability variation. We have compared simulated calorimeter ADC spectra due to 70 MeV positrons and photons with a Monte Carlo calculation of an ideal detector light response. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The Q(beta) of Ce-151 in the fission products of U-235 was successfully determined to be 5.27(20)MeV using an on-line mass-separator for the first time. We have proposed the possibility of determining Q(beta) up to about 10 MeV using a total absorption detector without the knowledge of the decay scheme. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.
