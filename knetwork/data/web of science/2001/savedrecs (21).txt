Materials and methods: Each nuclide was administered intraperitoneally in citrate solution to three groups of adult male CBA/H mice at levels of activity which gave estimated life-time average skeletal doses of about 0.25-0.3 Gy, 0.5-1 Gy and 1-2 Gy. Animals were carefully monitored and sacrificed as soon as they showed signs of ill health; tumours were identified by standard histopathological techniques. Results: Statistical modelling by Cox regression showed that, considering all three nuclides together, there was a highly significant increase in risk of death from osteosarcoma or myeloid leukaemia with increasing dose rate. For osteosarcoma, the effect was significantly greater for (239)Pu than (241)Am, while separate analysis for (233)U showed no significant increase with increasing dose rate. For example, the increase in relative risk of death from osteosarcoma for an increase in life-time average dose rate to bone of 1 mGy d(-1) was 4.2 (2.7-6.5) for (239)Pu, 2.3 (1.4-3.4) for (241)Am and 1.1 (0.4-3.1) for (233)U. For myeloid leukaemia, there was no significant difference between (239)Pu and (241)Am in the effect of dose rate. The increase in relative risk from myeloid leukaemia for an increase in average dose rate of 1 mGy d(-1) was 1.8 (1.1-2.8) for (239)Pu, 2.0 (1.4-2.9) for (241)Am and 1.5 (0.8-2.7) for (233)U. Significant increases in renal and hepatic carcinomas were also recorded in animals exposed to (233)U and (241)Am, respectively. Studies of the distribution of the nuclides within the skeleton, published separately, have shown differences in their retention in individual bones and within bone. The proportions of decays occurring near to endosteal bone surfaces and throughout bone marrow were in the order: (239)Pu > (241)Am > (233)U. Conclusions : For osteosarcoma, the relative effectiveness of the nuclides in terms of average bone dose, in the order (239)Pu > (241)Am > (233)U, is consistent with the proportion of dose delivered near to endosteal surfaces. For myeloid leukaemia, the greater effectiveness of (239)Pu and (241)Am than (233)U is consistent with their accumulation in marrow.

We aim to investigate the prevalence of presumably radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes of children in Elbmarsch and children of a control region in order to find out whether there was an uncontrolled release of radioactive material which resulted in a substantial exposure. Materials and methods: The frequency of dicentric and ring chromosomes in lymphocytes of the peripheral blood in 42 children in Elbmarsch and 30 children in Plon was investigated. Children in both groups had been permanent residents of the study area. Results: The mean frequency of dicentric and ring chromosomes in Elbmarsch was 14/32580 cells (= 0.430 x 10(-3); 95% CI 0.24-0.70 x 10(-3) cells), and in Plon it was 17/24065 cells (= 0.706 x 10(-3); 95% CI 0.42-1.10 x 10(-3) cells). Conclusions : No difference in the frequency of dicentric and ring chromosomes was observed between children in Elbmarsch living close to a combined site of a nuclear power plant and a nuclear research facility and children living in the control area Plon. The power of the study to detect a threefold or higher increase in the aberration frequency was at least 0.86.

The technique involves the exothermic decomposition of viscous liquid prepared by thermal dehydration of the aqueous solution containing thorium nitrate and glycine. Thoria powders of different crystallite sizes, surface areas and sinterabilities were prepared by starting with two different fuel-to-oxidant molar ratios. The exothermic decomposition of viscous liquid, at about 200 degreesC, containing thorium nitrate-to-glycine in molar ratio 1:1.2 yielded the well-crystalline nano-sized ThO2 powder. Thoria powders prepared by this technique were shown to have a higher surface area (> 50 m(2)/g) and could be sintered to highly dense pellets (greater than or equal to 93% th.d.) at relatively low sintering temperature of 1300 degreesC for 3 h.

The effects of alpha-radiolysis on UO2 alteration in aerated deionized water were studied by characterizing both the chemistry of irradiated aqueous solutions and the UO2 surface. Uranium (as uranyl ion UO22+) and hydrogen peroxide concentration (H2O2) increased whereas pH decreased in the irradiated solutions when alpha-beam flux increased. The formation of hydrated uranium peroxide (metastudtite UO4. 2H(2)O) on UO2 leached surface was identified by X-ray diffractometry. The production of metastudtite can be considered as a direct effect of water radiolysis due to the production of radiolytic species H2O2 since its formation is known to occur out of irradiation via a precipitation reaction between hydrogen peroxide and uranyl ion. From both these observations and literature about hydrated uranium peroxide occurrence, the possibility of metastudtite formation on nuclear spent fuel in storage conditions is discussed.

Their data were compared with previously reported results of high-burnup Zircaloy-clad type fuel pellets, so as to clarify the effect of pellet-cladding interaction (PCI) restraint on the rim structure formation. The porous rim structure, accompanying huge bubbles and high porosity, was recognized for the high-burnup discs of 86 and 90 GWd/t, but not for the 51 GWd/t disc. From the good coincidence between porosity increase and density decrease for the high-burnup discs, it was concluded that the precipitation and growth of coarsened rim bubbles substantially caused fuel swelling. The wide variety of rim bubble sizes and porosities at a given local burnup, which was recognized in the present PCI-free discs and Zircaloy-clad type pellets reported in other literature. possibly resulted from the external PCI restraint effect. The pressure difference between bubble internal and external pressures, and vacancy diffusivity would rate-control the growth of rim bubbles. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The rod average burn-up ranged from 31.2 to 35.6 MWd/kgHM. Comparison is made with the percentage of gas released from French MOX fuels and UO2 fuel. The results show that in the burn-up range investigated, SBR MOX fuel and MIMAS MOX fuel perform similarly, releasing up to about 1%, of the fission gas inventory. Comparisons with the Halden Criterion show that SBR MOX has the same release threshold as UO2 and this suggests that the mechanisms of release in the two fuels are similar. This is further supported by calculations made with the ENIGMA fuel performance code. It is concluded that the apparent differences in fission gas release between SBR MOX and UO2 fuel, at least in the early stages of release, can be explained by the higher temperatures experienced by MOX fuel.

The disk-shaped UO2 and UO2-10 wt%Gd2O3 samples were prepared and irradiated to about 4%FIMA to measure the thermal diffusivities by the laser flash method. The burnup was almost uniform within each sample. The irradiation temperature was almost constant and uniform within each sample except the temperature escalation that occurred during the irradiation. The thermal conductivity, determined from the thermal diffusivity, density and specific heat capacity, decreased by irradiation, while it partly recovered after the thermal diffusivity measurement at temperatures up to about 1800 K. The thermal conductivity reduction attributable to the irradiation-induced point defects was small in the samples which experienced higher temperature than 1273 K during the temperature escalation. The present results were compared with the reported models. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Oktay, E; Yayli, A				Oktay, E; Yayli, A			Physical properties of thorium oxalate powders and their influence on the thermal decomposition	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article								Thorium oxalate dihydrate powders were obtained by precipitation from thorium nitrate solution using oxalic acid in the presence of ultrasound and mechanical agitation. Properties measured included particle morphology, particle size and particle size distribution, and specific surface area. The thermal decompositions of the powders were investigated by using thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis techniques. The result showed that the thermal decomposition stages of the thorium oxalate dihydrate obtained by mechanical and ultrasonic agitation are same. The decomposition reactions of the oxalates precipitated in the presence of ultrasound proceed in a narrower temperature interval, within a shorter period of time. The kinetic parameters for each stage were calculated. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A pyrometallurgical partitioning process is being developed to recover transuranic elements from such waste. Small amounts of U contained in the high-level liquid waste are also recovered in the process. A key issue for developing the process is effective separation of U and the transuranic elements from the rare-earth elements, because the two elemental groups are chemically analogous. A series of process tests were carried out in the present study to demonstrate that a combination of electrorefining and reductive extraction is useful for separating U and transuranic elements from the rare-earth elements. The results indicate that 99% of U and each transuranic element is recovered by the combination process as a product, and that the quantity of rare-earth elements contained in the product is smaller than the transuranic elements by weight. The overall mass balance of U and transuranic elements in the system ranged within the experimental errors assigned to sampling and analysis.

J	Lee, BH; Koo, YH; Sohn, DS				Lee, BH; Koo, YH; Sohn, DS			Rim characteristics and their effects on the thermal conductivity in high burnup UO2 fuel	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						high burnup; threshold burnup; porous rim; porosity; thermal conductivity; fuel performance	GAS-RELEASE; RECRYSTALLIZATION; PLUTONIUM	Characteristics of high burnup UO2 fuel such as threshold burnup for the formation of high burnup microstructure (rim), rim average burnup and rim width were estimated and then the thermal conductivity degradation due to the porous rim region was investigated. The threshold burnup for rim formation was estimated as a function of temperature and fission rate using Rest's model. The calculated threshold burnup, which shows a particular dependence on temperature, ranges from 40 to 50 MWd/kgU at typical fuel periphery temperatures of 400 to 600 degrees C. In addition, the rim average burnup and the rim width were obtained by statistical analysis of the data available in open literature. To consider the additional degradation of thermal conductivity in the rim region, a formula for rim porosity was presented with the assumption that rim pores are overpressurized and that all the produced fission gases are retained in the rim pores. To estimate the thermal conductivity in the porous rim using the general correction method applicable to two-phase structure, it was assumed that the rim region consists of pores and fully dense materials composed of UO2 matrix and solid fission products. Then by combining the general model for two-phase with the rim porosity developed in the present paper and HALDEN's thermal conductivity model, a thermal conductivity model for the porous rim region was developed. The predicted thermal conductivity shows an additional reduction of similar to 20% due to the porous rim structure which would cause to increase the fuel temperature of high burnup fuel during steady-state operation and transient irradiation.

Calculation codes developed in Japan, ACT4 and CINAC version 4, and nuclear data bases such as JENDL/Act-96, FENDL/A-2.0 and Lib90 were used for the calculation. Although several corrections in algorithms for both the calculation codes were needed, it was shown by comparing calculated results with the experimental data that most of activation cross sections and decay data were adequate. In cases of type 316 stainless steel and copper which were important for ITER, prediction accuracy of decay heat within +/-10% was confirmed. However, it was pointed out that there were some problems in parts of data such as improper activation cross sections, e.g., the Mo-92(n, 2n)Mo-91g reaction in FENDL, and lack of activation cross section data, e.g., the Ba-138(n, 2n)Ba-137m reaction in JENDL. Modifications of cross section data were recommended for 19 reactions in JENDL and FENDL. It was also pointed out that X-ray and conversion electron energies should be included in decay data.

One of the principal objectives of the present studies is the establishment of simulation method to predict the tritium behavior after the tritium leak event should happen in a ventilated room. The RNG model was found to be valid for eddy flow calculation in the 50 m(3)/h ventilated Caisson with acceptable engineering precision. The calculated initial and removal tritium concentration histories after intended tritium release were consistent with the experimental observations in the 50 m(3)/h ventilated Caisson. It is found that the flow near a wall plays an important role for the tritium transport in the ventilated room. On the other hand, tritium behavior intentionally released in the 3,000 m(3) of tritium handling room was investigated experimentally under a US-Japan collaboration. The tritium concentration history calculated with the same method was consistent with the experimental observations, which proves that the present developed method can be applied to the actual scale of tritium handling room.

The specific activity of N-13, one of the principal airborne radioactivities, was measured as a function of the irradiation time at a dose rate of about 6.10(16) eV/g/s, and compared with the calculated values. The predominant chemical species of N-13 produced were found to be N-13(2) and (NO2)-N-13. Their proportions were approximately 55% for N-13(2), and 45% for (NO2)-N-13, being almost independent of the irradiation time. Smaller quantities of (NO)-N-13 and (HNO2)-N-13 were also observed. Measurements of radiolytic products showed that ozone is a main product and that NO2 predominates among the products of nitrogen compounds, including HNO2 and HNO3. The G-value for ozone formation in air was estimated from the experimental data as 6.4 molecules/100 eV.

The affinity of radioactive nuclides for carboxyl groups in gel matrices increased in the order of Na+ < Cs+ < Co2+ < Pd2+, Sr2+, Fe3+ < Eu3+, Am3+. Among alginate gels, calcium alginate exhibited relatively higher uptake rate and distribution coefficient of Am3+. The column packed with calcium alginate beads was effective for the removal of trace amounts of Am3+ from acidic nitrate solutions.

J	Martinez-Aguire, A; Perianez, R				Martinez-Aguire, A; Perianez, R			Sedimentary speciation of U and Th isotopes in a marsh area at the southwest of Spain	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							SEQUENTIAL EXTRACTION PROCEDURE	A study of the distribution of U and Th-isotopes in different fractions of intertidal sediments collected in a marsh area has been carried out. This marsh area is affected by the releases of natural radionuclides from fertilizer industries carried out into the Odiel river. The study has shown that uranium is mainly located in non-residual fractions of the sediments and particularly coprecipitated with amorphous ferromanganese oxyhydroxides. In the case of Th isotopes, the contribution of residual fractions is higher than that of non-residual fractions, being the main non-residual fraction again the amourphous ferromanganese oxyhydroxides. However, all fractions seems to reflect the same pattern of contamination. Thus, those sediments located along the Odiel river basin have the higher concentration in all sequentially extracted fractions. Some interesting activity and mass ratios have also been investigated.

Two techniques were applied: passive Pico-rad) and alpha-spectrometry for radon progeny concentration measurement (SILENA. It was found that only 7% of results exceeded a dose limit of 400 Bq.m(-3), established for old buildings. Radon concentration levels ranged from 0.2 to 5150 Bq.m(-3) Distribution of the results satisfied a log-normal relationship. Applying these two methods at the same time, the radioactive equilibrium factor of radon and its progeny was determined. In the underground ways, open for visitors, no higher radon concentration was observed.

After production it was transported via a gas-jet system to the centrifuge system SISAK 3. Following on-line extraction with trioctylamine/scintillation solutions from 1M lactic acid, Pa-224 was detected applying on-line alpha -liquid scintillation counting. Unambiguous identification was achieved using time-correlated alpha-alpha -decay chain analysis. This constitutes the first chemical on-line separation and detection of a subsecond alpha -decaying nuclide, 0.85-s Pa-224 With the fast extraction system SISAK 3.

In waters of big rivers (the Vistula and the Odra rivers), lakes and tap water the annual average concentrations were similar to each other being from 1.4 to 1.9 Bq.dm(-3). These concentrations were similar to those in the precipitation in which they ranged from 1.7 to 2.2 Bq.dm(-3). The lowest tritium concentrations were found in waters of the Seashore Region rivers (average for 1994-1999 was 1.1 Bq.dm(-3)). The tritium concentrations in surface waters and in precipitation are still higher than that of natural level. The data obtained show that tritium concentration in the water of rivers might depend on the size of drainage area The observed seasonal variations of tritium concentration in the precipitation collected in Warsaw and at the Mount Sniezka indicate the stratospheric source of tritium. It was found that about 30% of tritium deposited with precipitation is removed to the Baltic Sea with river waters.

It was found that alkaline NaClO gave good results, reaching the dissolution of up to 300 mum of uranium foil. The different conditions for the dissolution were studied and the optimum ones were found. The influence of NaClO and NaOH concentration, temperature, dissolving solution volume per unit of surface and dissolution time were investigated. During this step, a gas, identified as H-2, was generated, and a precipitate characterized as Na2U2O7 was observed. A stoichiometric reaction for this uranium dissolution is proposed.

The rate of the deuterium exchange in (NH)-H-1 site is higher than that in (NH)-H-2 site and both depend visibly on the solvent. The higher the polarity of the solvent the lower the rate constant of the exchange reaction. The equilibrium isotope effect is relatively high and depends on the solvent, however, no distinct correlation could be found between the fractionation factor and electron donor or acceptor properties of the solvent.

Solid lead targets (8 cm in diameter and 20 cm long) were surrounded with 6 cm thick paraffin as neutron moderator and then irradiated. The transmutation of Pu-239 and the associated production of fission products Sr-91, Sr-92, Sr-97, Mo-99, Ru-103, Ru-105, Sb-129, Te-132, I-133, I-135 and Ce-143 were studied in the present work. The plutonium samples teach 449 mg) were placed on the outer surface of moderator. For 1.0 GeV proton beam, the fission rate of Pu-239 is 0.0032 atoms per proton in one gram plutonium samples, for 0.53 GeV proton, this value is 0.0022. The experimental uncertainty is about 15%. The experiments are compared to two theoretical model calculations with moderate success, using the Dubna Cascade Model (CEM) and the LAHET code. The practical incineration rate of Pu-239 is very high. For example: if one uses 10 mA, 1 GeV proton beams under the same (fictive) experimental conditions, the incineration rate of Pu-239 via fission is 3 mg out of the 449 mg sample per day. For 0.53 GeV protons the corresponding rate is 2 mg per day.

When uranium depleted Purer HLW at appropriate acidity is passed sequentially through octyl (phenyl)-N,N-diisobutytcarbamoylmethylphosphine oxide (CMPO) sorbed on chromosorb-102 (abbreviated as CAC) and Zeolite AR1 (synthetic mordenite) columns, all the trivalent, tetravalent and hexavalent metal ions and monovalent Cs-137 ions are sorbed. After adjusting to pH 2 with NaOH the resulting effluent is used as feed in a single stage membrane cell partitioned with a PTFE membrane impregnated with KSM-17 and having a feed and receiver compartment with 5.0 ml capacity each. The receiver compartment was filled with a 0.5M HNO3 or 0.5M HCl stripping solution. Y-90 alone is preferentially transported across the membrane leaving behind all the impurities viz. Sr-90, Sb-125, Ru-106, Rh-106, etc. in the feed compartment. This technique can yield Y-90 in mCi levels in a pure and carrier-free form for medical applications. The feed can be reused repeatedly after allowing for Y-90 buildup.

The selective adsorption mechanism was analyzed according to the structure character of self-made silica gel and performance of zirconium in acid simulated HLLW. The results show that the adsorption selectivity of self-made silica gel for zirconium is strong, because zirconium has higher positive charge and zirconium ion hydrolyzes easily. Distribution coefficient of self-made silica gels for zirconium is 53.5 ml/g. There are 6.5 (OH)/nm(2) on the surface on self-made silica gels which provide more adsorption activity places, thus self-made silica gels have higher adsorption capacity for zirconium (31.4 mg/g). The elution rate of the adsorption of zirconium on self-made silica gel by 0.2 mol/l H2C2O4 is more than 99%. The solubility of the self-made silica gel in nitric acid is low, the chemical stability of self-made silica gel is very strong.

The two materials examined were the analogue of the natural titanosilicate penkvilksite-2O (AM-3) and a synthetic antimonysilicate. Ion-exchange experiments were performed with solutions labelled with radioactive cobalt ((60)Co). The sorption of (60)Co Onto the two samples materials were compared in terms of distribution coefficient (K(d)) sorption percentage and cobalt quantity removed in mg per gram weight of the material. Several parameters were investigated viz, contact time, cobalt concentration, and sorbent concentration. It was found that the batch factor and cobalt concentration had a significant influence on the sorption of cobalt onto both of the materials. This was associated with the difference in pH generated by suspensions of the materials in water which was alkaline for the penkvilksite-2O analogue, and acid for the synthetic antimonysilicate.

The behavior of fuel burnup, depletion of BN and B, the effect of coating thickness and also Gd2O3 content on the burnup performances of the fuels were found by using the code WIMS-D/5 for pressurized water reactor (PWR) and boiling water reactor (BWR) fuel assemblies. The optimum thickness ratio of B to BN was found as 4 and their thicknesses were chosen as 4 and 1 mum, respectively. Based on this observation, calculations were performed for the standard fuel assemblies with and without burnable poison and similar assemblies with BN-B hybrid coating with the desired BN-B thicknesses. Results are discussed to make an assessment of the effect of such hybrid coating on fuel cycle characteristics. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Herring, JS; MacDonald, PE; Weaver, KD; Kullberg, C				Herring, JS; MacDonald, PE; Weaver, KD; Kullberg, C			Low cost, proliferation resistant, uranium-thorium dioxide fuels for light water reactors	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								Our objective is to develop a fuel for the existing light water reactors (LWRs) that, (a) is less expensive to fabricate than the current uranium-dioxide (UO2) fuel: (b) allows longer refueling cycles and higher sustainable plant capacity factors: (c) is very resistant to nuclear weapon-material proliferation: (d) results in a more stable and insoluble waste form; and (e) generates less high level waste. This paper presents the results of our initial investigation of a LWR fuel consisting of mixed thorium dioxide and uranium dioxide (ThO2-UO2). Our calculations using the SCALE 4.4 and MOCUP code systems indicate that the mixed ThO2-UO2 fuel, with about 6 wt.% of the total heavy metal U-235, could be burned to 72 MW day kg(-1) (megawatt thermal days per kilogram) using 30 wt.%, UO2 and the balance ThO2. The ThO2-UO2 cores can also be burned to about 87 MW day kg(-1) using 35 wt.% UO2 and 65% ThO2 with an initial enrichment of about 7 wt.% of the total heavy metal fissile material. Economic analyses indicate that the ThO2-UO2 fuel will require less separative work and less total heavy metal (thorium and uranium) feedstock. At reasonable future costs for raw materials and separative work. the cost of the ThO2-UO2 fuel is about 9%, less than uranium fuel burned to 72 MW day kg(-1). Because ThO2-UO2 fuel will operate somewhat cooler, and retain within the fuel more of the fission products, especially the gasses. ThO2-UO2 fuel can probably be operated successfully to higher burnups than UO2 fuel. This will allow for longer refueling cycles and better plant capacity factors. The uranium in our calculations remained below 20 wt.% total fissile fraction throughout the cycle, making it unusable for weapons. Total plutonium production per MW day was a factor of 3.2 less in the ThO2-UO2 fuel than in the conventional UO2 fuel burned to 45 MW day kg(-1). Pu-239 production per MW day was a factor of about 4 less in the ThO2-UO2 fuel than in the conventional fuel. The plutonium produced was high in Pu-238, leading to a decay heat about three times greater than that from plutonium derived from conventional fuel burned to 45 MW day kg(-1) and 20 times greater than weapons grade plutonium. This will make fabrication of a weapon more difficult. Spontaneous neutron production from the plutonium in the ThO2-UO2 fuel was about 50% greater than that from conventional fuel and ten times greater than that from weapons grade plutonium. High spontaneous neutron production drastically limits the probable yield of a crude weapon. Because ThO2 is the highest oxide of thorium while UO2 can be oxidized further to U3O8 or UO3, ThO2-UO2 fuel appears to be a superior waste form if the spent fuel is to be exposed ever to air or oxygenated water. And, finally, use of higher burnup fuel will result in proportionally fewer spent fuel bundles to handle, store, ship, and permanently dispose of. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The fissile content adjustment method produces DUPIC fuel of fixed U-235 and Pu-239 contents, while the reactivity control method produces DUPIC fuel of uniform reactivity at the fresh condition. To assess the uncertainty of the core performance parameter associated with the isotopic variation, the sensitivity coefficients were generated by the generalized perturbation theory for the lattice parameter and zone controller level perturbations. The uncertainty was then estimated for three key core performance parameters: maximum channel power (MCP), maximum bundle power (MBP), and channel power peaking factor (CPPF). The fissile content adjustment method was shown to have a smaller uncertainty in the core performance parameter than with the reactivity control options. For the fissile content adjustment method, the average uncertainties of MCP, MBP, and CPPF were estimated to be 1.3, 2.5, and 1.2%, respectively with 95% confidence level, when simulated for specified burnup points of the equilibrium core.

J	Choi, H				Choi, H			Composition heterogeneity analysis for direct use of spent pressurized water reactor fuel in CANDU reactors (DUPIC) - II: Statistical analysis	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article								The fuel composition heterogeneity effect on reactor performance parameters was assessed by refueling simulations for three DUPIC fuel options of fuel composition heterogeneity control: fissile content adjustment, reactivity control by slightly enriched and depleted uranium, and reactivity control by natural uranium. For each DUPIC fuel option, the simulations were performed using 30 heterogeneous fuel types, which were determined by the agglomerative hierarchical clustering method. The heterogeneity effect was considered during the refueling simulation by randomly selecting fuel types for the refueling operation. The refueling simulations of the heterogeneous core have shown that the key performance parameters, such as the maximum channel power (MCP), maximum bundle power (MBP), and channel power peaking factor (CPPF), are close to those of the care that has a single fuel type. For the three DUPIC fuel options, the uncertainties of MCP, MBP, and CPPF due to the fuel composition heterogeneity are <0.6, 1.5 and 0.8%, respectively. This study has shown that the three DUPIC fuel options reduce the composition heterogeneity effectively, and the zone power control system has a sufficient margin to adjust the perturbations caused by fuel composition heterogeneity.

The neutronic characteristics of the fissile and fertile materials have been exploited to arrive at optimal fuel assembly and core configurations. Each fuel assembly consists of art enriched uranium seed zone and a thoria blanket zone. They are in the form of ring-type fuel clusters. The fuel is contained in vertical pressure tubes placed in a hexagonal lattice array in a D2O moderator. Boiling H2O coolant is used. The U-235 enrichment is similar to5.4%. The thoria rods contain the U-233 bred in situ by irradiation of one batch load of mere thoria clusters (without the seed zone) for one fuel cycle in the same reactor. There is no need for external feed enrichment in thoria rods. Additionally, some moveable thoria clusters are used for the purpose of xenon override. The fissile production rate from the fertile material and the consumption rate of fissile inventory is judiciously balanced by the choice of U/Th fuel rod diameter and the number and location of thoria rods in the fuel assembly and in the core. During steady-state operation at rated power level, there is no need for any conventional control maneuvers such as change in soluble boron concentration or control rod movement as a function of burnup. Burnable poison rods are also not required. A very small reactivity fluctuation of +/-2 mk in 300 effective full-power days of operation is achieved and can be nearly met by coolant inlet enthalpy changes or moveable thoria clusters. Control is required only for cold shutdown of the reactor. The uranium as well as thoria rods achieve a fairly high burnup of 30 to 35 GWd/tonne at the time of discharge. Since the excess reactivity for hot-full-power operation is nearly zero at all times during the fuel cycle and since the coefficients of reactivity due to temperature and density variations of coolant are nearly zero by design, there is hardly any possibility of severe accidents involving large reactivity excursions.

It accumulates in the cadmium pool both as dissolved zirconium and as a zirconium-cadmium intermetallic precipitate. Two electrochemical methods of removing zirconium from the electrorefiner have been evaluated. The first is a three-step method consisting of chemical oxidation of zirconium by CdCl2 addition, depletion of zirconium from the cadmium pool by electrotransport, and drawdown of zirconium from the LiCl-KCl eutectic salt by using a different electrorefiner configuration. A transport model is employed to determine the cell operating conditions for growing pure zirconium deposits and the throughput rate. The second method eliminates the chemical oxidation step and permits codeposition of uranium and zirconium onto the solid cathode. The transport model is used to assess the level of uranium impurity in the cathode product; an additional step is proposed to reoxidize uranium in the deposit. The two methods are compared from the standpoints of throughput, deposit composition, deposit adherence to a solid cathode mandrel, and the underlying uncertainties. A brief review is given of the related past laboratory work on removal of zirconium from the electrorefiner.

J	Pain, CC; de Oliveira, CRE; Goddard, AJH; Umpleby, AP				Pain, CC; de Oliveira, CRE; Goddard, AJH; Umpleby, AP			Non-linear space-dependent kinetics for the criticality assessment of fissile solutions	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							2-PHASE FLOW; SYSTEMS; SIMULATION; MODELS	A deterministic model for calculating the time dependent fission yield from solutions has been developed. The model is based on transient finite element methods and couples radiation transport modelling with computational fluid dynamics. Non-linear space dependent kinetic equations are derived, in which the non-linearities arise due to radiolytic gas generation, geometical changes in the liquid, the temperature dependent densities, cross sections and thermally/gas induced fluid motion. The latter advects the delayed neutron precursor concentrations together with the energy fields. Applications focus on the role of radiolytic gas evolution and buoyancy induced fluid motion on the criticality of fissile liquids with delayed and prompt supercritical step reactivity insertions. The analysis is performed with uranyl nitrate solutions. The theory behind the modelling is presented, together with numerical results, to validate the approach. The resulting computer code, which we call FETCH (finite element transient criticality), is validated against point kinetics based models fur right cylinders and against experiment for both low (delayed supercritical) and high powered (usually prompt supercritical) transients. The term 'low powered' in this context will be used to describe transients in fissile liquids in which the rate of radiolytic gas generation is so small that it can be ignored without sacrificing the accuracy of the simulations. Modelling can then be conducted in a single fluid phase. The term 'high powered' refers to transients in which gas evolution and ensuing free surface motion play an important part in their dynamics and are thus solved using the multi-phase mode of FETCH. The simulations presented here provided extensive insights into the dynamics of these transients which can be difficult to study in detail with experiment. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

All RTGs that have been launched by the U.S. have used heat sources fueled with the plutonium-238 isotope. Low-power (1 W-thermal) Light Weight Radioisotope Heater Units have also been used to maintain spacecraft equipment within their normal operating temperature range. Los Alamos National Laboratory is responsible for fabricating heat sources for current and future space missions. The (PuO2)-Pu-238 is purified by aqueous processing, fabricated into hot pressed pellets, encapsulated into precious metal cladding material, then the fueled clads are nondestructively tested. NASA currently plans for the potential use of radioisotope power systems for the Europa Orbiter and the Solar Probe missions, which are all scheduled for launch this decade. In addition several Mars Exploration missions over the next decade will employ radioisotope heater units. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The method employs two key concepts: linguistic variables and fuzzy numbers. The linguistic variables and fuzzy numbers are used to represent the decision-maker's subjective assessments for the decision criteria and the decision alternatives versus the decision criteria. The fuzzy mean operator is used to aggregate the decision-maker's subjective assessments and the total integral value method is used to rank the decision alternatives. As a case study, the method is applied to evaluating the spent fuel storage options in Korea. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Based on the principles of factorial experimental design, the sensitivity analysis considers the impact of neutron flux, minor actinide content and dwell time on the quantity of plutonium that can be loaded to, and destroyed by, a transmutation system. The analysis also considers the potential environmental hazard associated with transmutation systems by investigating the corresponding integrated toxic potential of the final disposal inventory.

The roadmap defines a reference system along with preferred technologies, which require further development to reduce technical risk, associated deployment scenarios, acid a detailed plan of necessary R&D to support implementation of this technology. The potential for international collaboration is discussed which has the potential to reduce the cost of the program. A reference ATW plant design was established to ensure consistent discussion of technical and life cycle cost issues. Over 60 years of operation, a reference ATW plant would process about 10.000 tn of spent nuclear reactor fuel. This is in comparison to the current inventory U.S. of about 40,000 tn of spent fuel and the projected inventory of about 86,000 tn of spent fuel if all currently licensed nuclear power plants run until their license expire, The reference ATW plant was used together with an assumed scenario of no new nuclear plant orders in the U.S. to generate a deployment scenario for ATW. In the R&D roadmap, key technical issues are identified. and timescales are proposed for the resolution of these issues. A key recommendation is that, in the first year of any ATW program, trade studies intended to confirm technology choices and optimization of design be conducted. These studies will then be used to define future R&D. International collaboration will be important in this endeavor. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

One element of this roadmap was a development plan for the separations technologies that would be required to support an ATW system operating with a sustained feed of 1,450 tonnes of commercial light water reactor spent fuel per year. A Technical Working Group was constituted to identify appropriate separations processes and prepare a plan for their development. The baseline process selected combines aqueous and pyrochemical processes to enable efficient separation of uranium, technetium, iodine, and the transuranic elements from LWR spent fuel in the head-end step. For the recycle of unburned transuranics and newly-generated technetium and iodine from irradiated ATW transmuter assemblies, which were given to be metallic in form, a second and quite different pyrochemical process was identified. The diversity of processing methods was chosen for both technical and economic factors; aqueous methods are deemed to be better suited to large tonnages of commercial oxide spent fuel, while it is considered that pyrochemical processes can be exploited effectively in smaller-scale operations, particularly when the application is to metallic fuels or targets. A six-year technology evaluation and development program is foreseen, by the end of which an informed decision can be made on proceeding with demonstration of the ATW system.

J	Baxter, A; Rodriguez, C				Baxter, A; Rodriguez, C			The application of gas-cooled reactor technologies to the transmutation of nuclear waste	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								Nuclear waste from commercial power plants contains large quantities of plutonium, other fissionable actinides, and long-lived fission products that pose longterm safe storage problems. Along with materials from weapons decommissioning programs, they are also a proliferation concern. Based on current levels of global nuclear power generation, it is estimated that by 2015 there will be more than 250,000 tons of spent fuel worldwide. This waste will contain over 2,000 tons of plutonium. (There is also more than 100 tons of plutonium becoming available from disarmament programs.) The disposal of this nuclear waste from commercial and defense programs has become a significant environmental and political issue. Long-term uncertainties are hampering the acceptability of a geologic repository for spent fuel in the U.S. The greatest concerns are with the potential for radiation release and exposure from the waste, and the possible diversion of fissionable material. The development of high-power accelerators has brought up the possibility of a technological solution to the problem. This is the so-called accelerator transmutation of waste (ATW), in which an intense beam of protons is used to produce a large, high-energy neutron flux in a spallation target. The target is surrounded by a multiplying medium of the plutonium and actinide waste, which is destroyed by neutron fission and capture. This paper describes the application of gas-cooled technology to the ATW, which can result in the elimination of weapons-useful material in the waste in one pass, without intermediate reprocessing, along with at least an order of magnitude reduction in the amount of reactor-generated transuranic (TRU) waste. Repository heat loads and the radio-toxicity of the waste are dramatically reduced. The process provides a waste form that is highly resistant to corrosion. It is also passively safe and does not produce mixed waste. The use of gas-cooled nuclear technology also provides maximum flexibility in the transmutation approach, and can allow the use of a direct-cycle gas-turbine generator power conversion system to produce electricity with 47% efficiency. Economic analyses suggest that gas-cooled transmutation systems are economically viable and would attract private investment for deployment. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Revol, JP				Revol, JP			An accelerator-driven system for the destruction of nuclear waste	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								Progress in particle accelerator technology makes it possible to use a proton accelerator to produce energy and to destroy nuclear waste efficiently. The Energy Amplifier (EA) proposed by Carlo Rubbia and his group is a subcritical fast neutron system driven by a proton accelerator. It is particularly attractive for destroying, through fission, transuranic elements produced by present nuclear reactors. The EA could also transform efficiently and at minimal cost long-lived fission fragments using the concept of Adiabatic Resonance Crossing (ARC) recently tested at CERN with the TARC experiment. The ARC concept can be extended to several other domains of application (production of radioactive isotopes for medicine and industry, neutron research applications, etc.).

Their improved safety characteristics is also a beneficial feature in the perspective of very innovative reactor concept. Finally, it seems that the use of Thorium can be facilitated (at least from a neutronics point of view) by the use of ADS. These motivations justify relevant R and D programs in order to validate the concept. The present paper gives a number of arguments on the role of ADS, and gives some characteristics of an innovative ADS system (TASSE), based on a Th-molten salts fuel. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.
