The development of a suitable neutron source for such applications as studies of resonance phenomena, fast neutron radiography, selective fast neutron activation, explosives and contraband detection and others, depends on the output ion current of the accelerator and the design of the target system. A practical solution for a high pressure gas target was previously developed and successfully implemented at De Beers Diamond Research Laboratory in Johannesburg (Guzek et al., 1999), but it is limited to applications using low (<20%) duty cycle accelerators. The concept of a plasma window for the separation of a high pressure gas target region and accelerator vacuum, that was originally developed by Hershcovitch (1995) for electron welding applications, may be suitable for operation with continuous wave accelerators at high particle current output. Preliminary test results, which have been performed with various gases (argon, helium and deuterium), indicate that implementation of the plasma window into a gas target system, for the production of intense mono-energetic fast neutron beams will be achievable.

J	Bende, EE				Bende, EE			Temperature reactivity effects in pebbles of a high-temperature reactor fueled with reactor-grade plutonium	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						plutonium; high-temperature reactor; temperature coefficient	COEFFICIENT	This work presents the temperature reactivity effects occurring in pebbles of a high-temperature reactor fueled with reactor-grade plutonium, without any additional resonance absorbers. Burnup calculations are performed for pebbles loaded with various amounts of plutonium per pebble. During burnup, branching calculations are carried out to calculate k(infinity) as a function of the uniform temperature. For a high plutonium mass per pebble and low burnup values, k(infinity) decreases with uniform temperature, which indicates a negative uniform temperature coefficient of reactivity (UTC). However, for a low plutonium mass per pebble, as well as for a high plutonium mass per pebble in combination with high burnup, k(infinity) is maximal at a particular uniform temperature. Below this temperature, the UTC is positive, while above this temperature it is negative. Branching calculations with only a varying moderator temperature show almost the same behavior, which indicates that the contribution of the fuel temperature plays a minor role for the mentioned effect. To understand the reactivity effect, the moderator temperature coefficient (MTC) is investigated by two methods. In the first method, changes in reaction rates of individual nuclides and their corresponding contributions to the MTC are calculated, whereas in the second method the four-factor formula has been used. For the fresh fuel cases, the positive coefficient at low temperature is due to a positive coefficient for the thermal utilization factor. For high moderator temperatures, the coefficient for the resonance escape probability renders the MTC negative. This trend is basically caused by the shift of the high-energy tail of the Maxwell-spectrum toward the 1-eV resonance of Pu-240, and toward the resonances of Pu-241, which leads to an increase of the capture-to-fission ratio.

J	Forsberg, CW				Forsberg, CW			Effect of depleted-uranium dioxide particulate fill on spent-nuclear-fuel waste packages	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						repository; spent nuclear fuel; depleted uranium	CRITICAL CONFIGURATIONS; GEOLOGIC REPOSITORIES; NEUTRONIC ANALYSIS; YUCCA MOUNTAIN; URANINITE; SYSTEM; OXIDES; FLOW	The use of depleted uranium dioxide (DUO2) particulates as fill material for repository waste packages (WPs) containing light-water reactor (LWR) spent nuclear fuel (SNF) was investigated A repository WP would be loaded with SNF, and small DUO2 particulates (0.5 to 1.0 mm) would be added to fill the void space inside the WP-including the coolant channels inside SNF assemblies. The DUO2 fill slows release of radionuclides from the SNF by (a) creating a local chemically reducing environment that slows degradation of the SNF UO2 and (b) reducing groundwater flow through the WP. The depleted uranium (DU) fill minimizes the potential for long-term criticality in the repository by isotopic dilution of U-233 and U-235. The potential for criticality is primarily determined by U-235 (a) originally in the SNF and (6) from decay of Pu-239. The use of DU consumes excess DU from the production of enriched uranium. The mechanisms for improvements in repository performance with DUO2 fill are defined, but additional work is required to fully quantify the benefits and costs of such an approach.

A seventh volume on the physics of plutonium fuel in boiling water reactors is in preparation. The analyses have been mostly in the form of theoretical benchmark exercises for situations beyond current experience, for which multinational contributions provide a basis for comparison of diverse calculational methods and nuclear data libraries.

High-performance general-purpose detectors might collect event samples of the order of a billion events or more. This could greatly improve on the existing analyses of neutrino interactions and also lead to new and important analysis topics including, for example, precise determinations of the CKM matrix elements \V-ub\ and \V-cb\. The potential of such general-purpose detectors is illustrated with reference to a previously discussed detector (B.J. King, Neutrino physics at a Muon Colliders, Proceedings of the Workshop on Physics at the First Muon Collider and Front End of a Muon Collider, Fermilab, November 6-9, 1997) that is structured around a novel and compact vertexing and tracking neutrino target comprising a stack of CCD pixel devices. Design ideas and prospects are also discussed for two types of specialized detectors: (i) polarized targets filled with polarized solid protium-deuterium (HD), for unique and powerful studies of the nucleon's spin structure, and (ii) fully active liquid tracking targets with masses of several tonnes for precise determinations of the weak mixing angle, sin(2) theta(W), from the total cross-section for neutrino-electron scattering. All three detector types pose severe technical challenges but their utilization could add significantly to the physics motivation for neutrino factories. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Vinagre, FLR; Conde, CAN				Vinagre, FLR; Conde, CAN			A technique for the absolute measurement of the W-value for X-rays in counting gases	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						W-value; ionization yield; xenon; radiation physics; dosimetry; x-ray detectors	ION-PAIR; MEAN ENERGY; FANO FACTOR; LIQUID; MIXTURES; ARGON; XENON; KR; AR	A technique was developed for the absolute measurement of the W-value (the mean energy for the production of an electron-ion pair) for low-energy X-rays in a wide range of gases at atmospheric pressures, with a standard uncertainty better than 1%. This technique is based on the absolute measurement of the primary ionization charge produced by X-ray photons from a constant intensity monoenergetic X-ray source, e.g. a long lifetime radioactive source. The ionization charge is calibrated by the number of X-ray photons absorbed in the gas, counted with a photon detector. For this purpose, a hybrid detector system was tested and its use in W-value measurements was investigated. The technique was applied to pure xenon at 825 Torr with 5.9 keV X-rays and a W-value of 21.61(-0.10)(+0.14) eV was obtained for a 68% confidence level. The required corrections and the different factors contributing to the accuracy of the results are discussed. The advantages and limitations of this technique are explored and future developments are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This work presents the theory and experimental techniques applied to determine, by means of nondestructive gamma-ray spectroscopy, the burnup of Material Testing Reactor (MTR) fuel elements irradiated in the IEA-R1 research reactor. Burnup measurements, based on analysis of spectra that result from collimation and detection of gamma-rays emitted in the decay of radioactive fission products, were performed at the reactor pool area. The measuring system consists of a high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector together with suitable fast electronics and an on-line microcomputer data acquisition module. In order to achieve absolute burnup values, the detection set (collimator tube + HPGe detector) was previously calibrated in efficiency. The obtained burnup values are compared with ones provided by reactor physics calculations, for three kinds of MTR fuel elements with different cooling times, initial enrichment grades and total number of fuel plates. Both values show good agreement within the experimental error limits. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Separation of the nitrogen isotopes in a single gas centrifuge in the form of pure nitrogen, ammonia, and trifluoride of nitrogen as well as the carbon isotopes in the form of carbon dioxide has been studied by means of numerical simulation. The parameters of the centrifugal machine investigated were close to the parameters of the Iguassu machine. The dependence of the efficiency criterion versus the basic parameters of the separation process has been explored in the computational experiments. Comparisons of the calculated results with the experimental data have shown good agreement. The results obtained have demonstrated the possibility of using gas centrifuge technology to enrich successfully the low-abundant isotopes of light chemical elements. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

A thin hygroscopic salt layer has been laid on the flat surface of a solid scintillator mounted inside the monitor. A small pump continuously supplies the monitor with filtered air samples taken from the room. The tritium oxide (HTO) in the air flow is reversibly trapped on the hygroscopic surface. A fraction of the beta particles emitted by tritium produces scintillation light in the solid scintillator which is detected by a miniaturized photomultiplier tube. The monitor can reveal HTO air contamination as low as 8 x 10(5) Bq m(-3) - which is one-tenth of the limit for workers - in a short time (150 s). Several tests have been performed to check instrument response linearity and delay, the sensitivity to tritium and gamma-rays and the influence of other parameters such as air flow rate, relative humidity, vibrations and shocks.

An intuitive and physical description of the various measured quantities is given as well as a brief mathematical description and a brief description of how the data are acquired. If the full five-channel capability is used, the number of measured quantities increases in number but not in type. The parameters provided by this new processor can be divided into two general classes: time analysis signatures and their related frequency analysis signatures. The time analysis signatures include the number of time In pulses occurs in a time interval, that is triggered randomly, upon a detection event, or upon a source fission event triggered. From the number of pulses in a time interval, the moments, factorial moments, and Feynmann variance can be obtained. Recent implementations of third- and fourth-order time and frequency analysis signatures in this processor are also briefly described. Thus, this processor used with a timed source of input neutrons contains all of the information from a pulsed neutron measurement, one and two detector Rossi-alpha measurements, multiplicity measurements, and third- and fourth-order correlation functions. This processor, although originally designed for active measurements with a 252Cf interrogating source, has been successfully used passively (without Cf-252 source) for systems with inherent neutron sources such as fissile systems of plutonium. Data from active measurements with an 18.75 kg highly enriched uranium (93.2 wt%, U-235) metal casting for storage are presented to illustrate some of the various time and frequency analysis parameters. This processor, which is a five-channel time correlation analyzer with time channel widths as small as 1 ns, was developed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Oak Ridge Y-12 Plant where it is in use for verification and confirmation of weapons components and other fissile materials in storage and for receipts from other Department of Energy and Department of Defense Facilities.

This uncertainty was estimated for cylindrical chambers with different size in the present study. It was found that the uncertainty increased with the chamber height and radius. For short chambers with a height H = 2 cm the uncertainty was less than 5%, while in tall chambers with H = 7 cm it could be up to 17%. The radial track density on the CR39 detector inside the diffusion chamber was also found to be dependent on the fraction f(1). In this work, some examples of this dependence are shown.

An analysis of a large number of samples made it possible to construct a detailed picture of the contamination. The role of incidents in the formation of the contamination of graphite by individual radionuclides was determined. The distribution of the radionuclides in the masonry was studied. Correlations between the content of different radionuclides were investigated. Schemes for estimating the store of radionuclides in graphite masonry were constructed on the basis of the distribution of the radionuclides of different origin. In the approximate schemes the masonry was represented as a collection of cells. The store of a radionuclide was determined by summing its content in individual cells, which were divided into several categories according to their degree of contamination. The estimates of the store of radionuclides in the masonry differed strongly from the predicted values. The store of fission products and actinides was approximately ten times smaller than previously assumed; this could substantially simplify the disassembly and choice of utilization technology.

The radiotoxicity of a nuclide mixture is calculated. For transmutation of plutonium the radiotoxicity is maximum at the initial stage of irradiation as a result of the production of Pu-241 and, after further irradiation, the production of Cm-244. For transmutation of americium and curium the maximum radiotoxicity is 2-2.5 times greater than the initial value; it is due to the formation of Pu-238. It is established that the neutron flux density affects the rate of decrease of radiotoxicity.

Closing the nuclear fuel cycle so as to utilize uranium and plutonium from spent fuel elements is to establish nuclear power as a quasi-domestic energy source in Japan. Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd. is the only private enterprise in Japan to offer nuclear fuel cycle services. At Rokkasho, the company operates plants for reprocessing (under construction), uranium enrichment, treatment of radioactive waste, and a repository for low level radioactive materials. Consequently, an important sector of Japan's future energy supply is ensured on this location.

J	Suzuki, A				Suzuki, A			Japan's program for back-end of nuclear fuel cycle - Flexibility is the key	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			English	Article								An important problem to be solved in the future use of nuclear power is the management of spent fuel elements from nuclear power plants because of the radioactive inventory they contain, but also because of their contexts of valuable materials which can be used again in power generation. Two approaches, i.e. direct disposal and reprocessing, together with a separation between waste and valuable materials, are being pursued internationally, and are being discussed with respect to their pros and cons, especially with regard to the concepts to be employed for final storage. In Japan, an extensive study written by the Japan Cycle Development Institute about the program for the final storage of radioactive waste was published 1999; it shows several options for repository sites even under the special geological conditions of the country. In order to add flexibility to Japan's preferred approach of reprocessing nuclear fuels, also the possibility of interim storage is kept open, and advanced projects are under way for the transmutation of longlived nuclides. An essential factor influencing decisions in this area of the nuclear fuel cycle is the political and social climate, which makes the implementation of these plans a political problem.

J	Kuhn, K; Hawickhorst, W				Kuhn, K; Hawickhorst, W			Waste management and final storage in Germany failed for lack of content and a technical basis? Part 2	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								The assertion by the political parties at present in government in Germany, SPD and Alliance 90/The Greens, that "the previous waste management concept for radioactive waste had failed in terms of content and no longer had any technical basis," is a purely ideological statement utterly devoid of any realistic reason. In actual fact, die waste management concept so far pursued in Germany has been transferred into industrial practice in many areas: Transports of radioactive waste and spent fuel elements can be carried out safely at any time; spent fuel has been reprocessed on an industrial scale for many years. The central interim stores of Ahaus, Gorleben, and Lubmin, all of which are in operation, actually represent sufficient capacity for the interim storage of spent fuel elements. The successful exploration of the Gorleben salt dome has advanced far. No result so far would detract from its suitability. Consequently, the federal government should not try "to elaborate a (new) national waste management plan fbr the inherited burden of radioactive waste," but rather invest all its power to make functional as quickly as possible the missing building blocks in the existing waste management concept. In doing so, it would make an important contribution to domestic peace and to the international recognition of Germany as a high-tech country. Part 1 of the article, which was published in atw 7 (2000) pp. 453-456, covers reprocessing and direct final storage of spent fuel elements with interim storage in special casks while part 2 in this issue contains a survey of the final storage options and the final storage projects in Germany.

The complete System of measures now planned to avoid contamination in transit is based an the phased concept and the Overall assessment of the transport cycle. A number of additional measures are taken in the areas of technical measures; measurements and methods of measurement; documentation; flow of Information; and contractual stipulations. This System achieves major improvements over the previous transport system. The combined effect of all measures now planned will allow future transports of spent fuel elements and vitrified high-level waste to be carried out in such a way as to allow contamination problems to be avoided.

J	Harley, NH				Harley, NH			The 1999 Lauriston S. Taylor Lecture - Back to background: Natural radiation and radioactivity exposed	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						radiation, background; naturally occuring radionuclides; risk analysis; dose assessment	YORK-CITY RESIDENTS; RADON EXPOSURE; LUNG-CANCER; URANIUM; EXCRETION; TISSUES; MINERS; HUMANS; U-234	I am profoundly grateful for being chosen as the twenty-third presenter of the Lauriston S. Taylor Lecture, and I share this honor with a list of distinguished scientists, including my husband, who pay tribute to the premier leader in radiation protection. In 1938, Laurie was working for the National Bureau of Standards and chaired the Advisory Committee on X-ray and Radium Protection, a group of 8 persons, who set the pace for ail forthcoming radiation standards. NBS had, since 1913, been standardizing essentially all of the radium offered for sale in the U.S., and the problem arose to revise the handbook on proper conditions for handling radium based on the then current knowledge. This resulted in Handbook 23 (1938) superseding the 1934 work, At the time Laurie was a scientist working in the measurements side of radiation and though he contributed much to that field, his name is inseparably linked with guidance in radiation protection. Today we pay tribute for his leadership that he carried out with intelligence, grace, and personal warmth. My talk today deals mostly with measured data for naturally occurring internal radiation emitters and how these data can be used for predictive purposes in estimating the dose and risk from internal body contamination, This stresses the "and Measurements" part of the Council's title. The topic of this year's NCRP Annual Meeting is "Radiation Protection in Medicine: Contemporary Issues." I believe that physicians and State and Federal agencies will have to cope with complaints following various exposure situations resulting from the cleanup of background radionuclides during closure at nuclear facilities, military use of radioactivity, and occurrences of high natural background in some locations. They will find comfort in the knowledge that existing background radiation data can be the basis for predictions of realistic dose and risk in most situations.

J	Moeller, DW; Merwin, SE				Moeller, DW; Merwin, SE			Evaluation of uncertainties in estimates of fetal doses from Fe-59 kinetic studies at Vanderbilt University	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Review						epidemiology; ingestion; pregnancy; radiation dose		In a 1997 paper, Stabin et al, published estimates of the fetal radiation doses for women who received oral administrations of Fe-59 at Vanderbilt University in the 1940's, These authors concluded that there was "considerable uncertainty... In the amount of radioactive material administered to these subjects." In an effort to quantify this uncertainty, the underlying factors in the input data used in the Stabin et al, dose estimates have been examined in detail. Such factors include (a) an absence of detailed information on, and discrepancies in, the amounts of Fe-59 reported to have been administered; (b) the probability that the radioactive iron included Fe-55 as well as Fe-59; (c) uncertainties as to the period of time that elapsed between the administration of the radioiron and the taking of the maternal blood samples, and the accompanying impacts of radioactive decay; (d) possible losses of Fe-59 in the procedures used in preparing the blood samples; and (e) questions as to the reported efficiency of the counting equipment. Our principal conclusion is that, due to the significant uncertainties and the lack of key information, it is not possible to estimate the doses accurately. An ancillary conclusion, however, is that the doses were probably significantly higher than previously estimated. This latter possibility should be carefully considered by any investigators who subsequently seek to use these estimates to quantify the relationship between the doses to the fetus and the resulting health effects.

J	Skipperud, L; Oughton, DH; Salbu, B				Skipperud, L; Oughton, DH; Salbu, B			The impact of plutonium speciation on the distribution coefficients in a sediment-sea water system, and radiological assessment of doses to humans	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						plutonium; dose assessment; water; radiation, environmental	RADIONUCLIDE	When radionuclides are released from a source into the marine environment, the assessment of long term consequences to humans depends on information on the source term, transport in water, interactions with sediments (K-D) and biological uptake (CF). Sensitivity analysis of assessment models demonstrates that K-D is one of the most sensitive parameters contributing to large uncertainties in the assessment. furthermore, the interaction of Pu-species with sediments is a time and temperature dependant process. The distribution coefficient, Bq kg(-1) sediment per Bq L-1 sea water, increases with time until pseudo-equilibrium/equilibrium is reached (K-D). Thus, the contact time between contaminated sea water and sediments should be taken into account in dispersion and dose assessment models. In the present work, dynamic tracer experiments have been performed where different Pu-species are added to a sediment-sea water system to obtain information on K-D's. After a defined contact time, the samples have been sequentially extracted to determine mobile and bound fractions. The results indicate that the distribution coefficient, K-D, for plutonium depends on Pu-species in question. Thus, sediments act as a sink for Pu(III, IV) (high K-D), while Pu(III, IV)-organic and Pu(V, VI) should be considered more mobile (low K-D). Furthermore, the interaction with inert fractions obtained from sequential extraction depends less on Pu-species but increase with time. For short time interactions, species-specific time functions rather than K-D constants should be applied in assessment models. When the accepted K-D (10(5) L kg(-1)) is implemented in the model, the estimated collective dose is about 8 x 10(-4) person-Sv, i.e., a factor of about 2 lower than for Pu(III, IV)-organic and Pu(V, VI). So changes in K-D have an impact on the assessment of collective dose received from a potential release of plutonium from fallout, reactor accidents, etc., which underlines the need for more detailed studies on speciation, kinetics, and K-D's in different sediment-sea water systems.

J	Baek, I; Poston, JW				Baek, I; Poston, JW			A dosimetric model for inhaled radioactive gases	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						modeling, dose assessment; inhalation; lungs, human; radioactivity, airborne	WASHOUT; OZONE; LUNG	Mathematical simulation models have been used to study transport of insoluble and nonreactive gases for more than twenty years. However, gas and vapor transport and uptake still are not well understood, and a mathematical model for slightly soluble and nonreactive gas transport and uptake still has not been developed. This paper describes the development of a mathematical model of diffusion, convection, lateral transport into the airway wall, and alveolar absorption for inhaled radioactive gases in human conductive and respiratory airways. The model is based on a single-path trumpet-bell model. Sensitivity studies were conducted to ascertain the influence on the final model of the functional residual capacity, the tidal volume and diffusivity and solubility. Results obtained with this model are presented for HT gas exposure and are compared with other findings. In general, the results obtained in this research are in good agreement with other mean experimental results.

Since the data for samples from the 1960's and 1970's are important to understand the long-term movement, of H-3 in the environment, we searched for old diet samples. Recently, diet samples collected in Akita Prefecture during 1969-1982 were found and subjected to H-3 analysis. The samples were originally gathered for nutrition survey programs and had been stored in a refrigerated warehouse at -20 degrees C until we located them. The free water H-3 concentrations in the samples were measured and are reported here. The present results are combined with already published data; together they show H-3 concentrations exponentially decrease from 1969 to 1988 with an apparent half time of 5.9 y. Levels of diet free water H-3 concentrations are also similar to measured and estimated precipitation H-3 concentrations in Akita City.

The average concentrations of natural radioisotopes U-238, Th-232, and K-40 are 57.9 +/- 28.1 Bq kg(-1), 81.6 +/- 23.8 Bq kg(-1) and 1203.1 +/- 687.2 Bq kg(-1), respectively, These average values give rise to a mean absorbed dose rate of 0.128 +/- 0.051 mu Gy h(-1) at a height of 1.0 m and an effective dose equivalent of 156.90 mu Sv y(-1). The results indicate no radiological anomaly. The data presented here will serve as a baseline survey for primordial radionuclide concentrations in rocks of the area.

Originally, low energy photon counting systems consisted of sodium iodide or phoswich detectors, but they have been largely replaced by smaller germanium detector arrays. The average chest wall thicknesses of the LLNL phantom's torso plate and its overlay plates provided by the manufacturer refer to the regions covered by phoswich detectors; however, germanium detectors are of a different size and are placed in different locations on the phantom's torso plate. Previous work has shown that the manufacturer's data were not applicable for large area germanium detectors. The lung counting system at the Korea Atomic Energy Institute (KAERI) is a small area germanium detector array. Although the detectors are placed within the phoswich circles, only about 25% of the area is covered by the detectors. The LLNL phantom at KAERI has been examined to determine if the manufacturer's data are valid or if new chest wall thickness values must be determined. This paper presents chest wall thickness data for the LLNL phantom with and without its B-series overlay plates at 17 keV, 60 keV, 200 keV, and 1,500 keV and shows that these values are different from the manufacturer's values.

J	Distenfeld, C; Distenfeld, L				Distenfeld, C; Distenfeld, L			A programmable gas sampler to measure the average radon concentration in a test chamber or in the field	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topics; radon; sampling; radioactivity		A Tedlar gas sampling bag was used to retain samples of the test environment of interest. Samples, typically hourly, were transferred into a gas sampling bag. The volume of each sample was determined by a programmable timer or any computer capable of executing a compiled basic program. The program automatically adjusted the sample volume of each increment to exactly compensate for radioactive decay of radon referred to the end of the exposure period. At that time the radon activity collected in the sampling bag was the exact average for the whole period. A single Lucas cell was used to report the average concentration for typically 2 and 3 day exposures. The results compared with calculated predictions and with the average of a series of grab samples taken during the measurement period. The benefit of this method was the large work load reduction needed to determine the average concentration from a series of grab samples and the ability to employ Lucas cells, which are inherently more stable and less expensive than active measurement equipment normally used for chamber standardizations.

Ongoing interaction between faculty in the radiation oncology, radiation safety, and lab animal science disciplines revealed an acute need for radiation safety education for laboratory animal science students who will likely interact with researchers either designing and writing protocols for animal studies using radiation or radioactive materials, or veterinary staff who will use sources of radiation to diagnose and/or treat possible animal injuries and diseases. A core course in the Radiation Sciences graduate program was modified to address the needs of these students, instructing them in radiation safety, detection and counting instrumentation, and radiation biology. These fundamental areas were integrated to help the students gain a sound, basic knowledge of radiation and radioactive materials used in biomedical research.

The origin of the loss and five stages of the search, which turned out to be unsuccessful, are described in detail. These included monitoring the hospital incinerator, ifs ask, residential pathways, the municipal rubbish tip, the hospital theatre and its drains, and the hospital environs. incidentally the searcher nearly became a victim of quicksand anti a false lead was attributed to the use of uranium coloring agent in the wall tiles of the hospital theatre. The deduced lessons include the necessity for users of sealed radioactive sources to have adequately trained staff; to follow an accredited code of practice; to have ready access to a radiation survey meter; to have a suitable storage safe and a meticulously maintained source register. Some advice is given about the conduct of a search and desirable personal attributes of a proficient searcher.

Solid low-level radioactive samples (LLRS) were prepared for 15 routinely used radionuclides (Ca-45, I-125, P-32, P-33, S-35, Fe-59, I-123, I-131 Ga-67, Tc-93m, In-111, H-3, C-14, Cr-51, and Tl-201). For each radionuclide, incinerated one at a time, the smoke duct radioisotope concentration was less than 1/10 of the regulatory concentration limit (The Japanese law concerning prevention of radiation hazard due to radioisotopes, etc.). The radionclide-containing combustible and semi-combustible LLRS were incinerated at the AP-150R furnace erected at OURIC, and the distribution of radioactivity inside and outside the furnace was measured. In the experimental incineration of LLRS containing these 15 radionuclides, the fractions released (RF) in the gas phase of the final smoke duct ranged from 0.165 to 0.99. The radioactivities remaining in the incineration residue were Tc-99m, 87%; Fe-59, 83.1%; Ca-45, 75%; Cr-51, 62.1%; (33)p, 62.0%; (32)p, 61.1%; Ga-67, 57.7%; S-35, 26.0%; In-111, 21.1%; Tl-201, 16.6%; I-123, 11.9%; I-131, 8.2%; I-125, 2.4%; C-14, 0.39%; H-3, 0.04%. In the incineration of LLR S containing 35S, the rate of adhesion to the furnace wall was lower at high-temperature (809 degrees C) incineration than at low-temperature (376 degrees C) incineration. For LLRS containing one of the three radioiodines, I-123, I-125, or I-131, no such difference was observed between low (372 degrees C) and high (827 degrees C) temperature incineration (RF varied from 0.82 to 0.94).

By adjusting wavelength of the scintillation light to transmittance region of the optical fiber, the phoswich detector was capable of successfully performing simultaneous counting of alpha- and beta (including gamma)-rays. In addition, the detector has been applied to a dip-type inline monitor, which directly contacts with actinide solution.

The radiation detector consisted of a flow-cell containing granular 63-90 mu m Parylene C polymer coated CsI:T1 and two Burle 8850 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). The PMTs were connected in a software-realized coincidence mode. The digital data acquisition system consisted of a GaGe CompuScope 8012A/PCI 12-bit dual channel 50-MHz digital oscilloscope card residing in a Pentium III 450 MHz personal computer and:the:LabVIEW 5.1 data acquisition software. The individual fast anode scintillation pulses were digitized by the oscilloscope, transferred from on-board memory to computer memory, and processed by the LabVIEW Virtual Instrument (VI). The coincidence resolving time was set to 100 ns to reduce background. Pulse shape discrimination was achieved using the charge integration technique. Experimental tests showed very good pulse shape discrimination between alpha and beta particles. The alpha to beta and beta to alpha spillover were 2.1% and 1.4% respectively for single parameter analysis which yielded a figure of merit (FOM) of 1.65. The alpha to beta and beta to alpha spillover for dual parameter; analysis were 1.3% and 0.3%, respectively. The alpha and beta detection efficiencies for the CsI:T1 flow-cell were typically 31% and 26%, respectively.

The spatial distribution of non true events, scatter and randoms, originating from radioactivity outside the FOV was investigated. The image quality quantified with the noise equivalent count rate, improved by up to 58% as a consequence of shielding. Radioactivity in the first 10 cm outside the FOV was found to contribute most significantly to the detected events. A modular and easily movable patient body shield was designed.

Materials and methods: The human osteosarcoma cell line, OHS-sl, and mononuclear cells from bone marrow (BM) harvested from healthy donors, were used for these experiments. Cells in suspension were added to various activity concentrations of the and-osteosarcoma monoclonal antibody TP-3 radiolabelled with At-211. Following incubation for 1h, unbound radioactivity was washed off and cell survival was determined from clonogenic assays. Microdosimetry was calculated based on binding and retention kinetics of At-211 to the cells, as well as cellular and nuclear diameters. For comparison, cell suspensions were irradiated with a single dose of Co-60 gamma-rays. Results: At-211-labelled TP-3 showed heterogeneous binding to OHS-sl cells, with a considerable variation among experiments. About 78% of the initially bound At-211 decayed while associated with the OHS-sl cells. D-0 values estimated by microdosimetry were 0.33 (0.22-0.48, range) Gy and 1.18 (0.89-1.89) Gy for OHS-sl and BM cells, respectively, whereas D-0 values after external beam irradiation were 0.86+/-0.07 Gy and 1.71+/-0.22 Gy. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of At-211-labelled TP-3 at 37% survival was 3.43 for OHS-sl and 1.55 for BM. Conclusions: High-LET targeted alpha-particle exposure killed osteosarcoma cells more effectively than bone marrow cells, although heterogeneous antigen expression among these tumour cells limited the magnitude of this effect.

Based on detailed nuclear reactor calculations with the MCNP Monte Carlo code and binary collision approximation (BCA) computer simulations of the displacement damage in the polyatomic lattices with MARLOWE, it has been investigated how well the considered HFRs can meet the requirements for a fusion power reactor relevant irradiation. It is shown that a breeder material irradiation in these fission test reactors is well suited in this regard when the neutron spectrum is well tailored and the Li-6-enrichment is properly chosen. Requirements for the relevant nuclear irradiation parameters such as the displacement damage accumulation, the lithium burn-up and the damage production function W(T) can be met when taking into account these prerequisites. Irradiation times in the order of 2-3 full power years are necessary for the HFR to achieve the peak values of the considered fusion power Demo reactor blanket with regard to the burn-up and, at the same time, the dpa accumulation.

The fission rates have been measured using the back-to-back type double fission chamber at five thermal cores with different H/U-235 ratio so that the neutron spectra of the cores were systematically varied. The measured fission rate ratio per atom was 0.00439 to 0.0298, with a typical uncertainty of 2 to 3%. The measured data were compared with the calculated results using SRAC/TWOTRAN and MVP based on JENDL-3.2, which gave the averaged C/E values of 0.93 and 0.95, respectively. Obtained results of CIE using Np-237 cross sections from JENDL-3/2, ENDF/B-VI.5 and JEF2.2 show that the latter two gave smaller results than JENDL-3.2 by about 4%, which clearly reflects the discrepancy in the evaluated cross section among the libraries. This difference arises from both fast fission and resonance region. Although further improvement is recommended, Np-237 fission cross section in JENDL-3.2 is considered to be superior to those in the other libraries and can be adopted for use in design calculations for minor actinide transmutation system using thermal reactors with prediction precision of Np-237 fission rate within 10%.

J	Kurata, M; Kinoshita, K; Hijikata, T; Inoue, T				Kurata, M; Kinoshita, K; Hijikata, T; Inoue, T			Conversion of simulated high-level liquid waste to chloride for the pretreatment of pyrometallurgical partitioning process	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						pyrometallurgical partitioning; minor actinides; high-level liquid waste; denitration; chlorination; reductive extraction; conversion	RARE-EARTH ELEMENTS; URANIUM; BISMUTH; CADMIUM	A pyrometallurgical partitioning process is being developed for recovering minor actinides from high-level liquid waste resulting from PUREX reprocessing. Since the high-level liquid waste consists of concentrated raffinate, concentrated alkaline waste and insoluble residues, the various elements in the waste must be converted to chlorides before they can be sent on to the pyrometallurgical partitioning process. The conversion to chlorides is done by a combination of denitration and chlorination. The mass balance of these processes was measured in the present study using simulated high-level liquid waste. The results indicate that almost all of the alkali elements and Re, substituting for Tc, and significant amounts of Se, Cr, and Mo were separated by denitration, and that Cr, Fe, Zr, Mo, and Te were separated by chlorination. The remaining noble metals, Ni, U, and alkaline-earth and rare-earth elements were efficiently converted to chlorides, which were then supplied to the reductive extraction test using a molten salt/liquid-Cd system to demonstrate that the obtained chlorides are appropriate for processing by pyrometallurgical partitioning. In further reduction, noble metals and Ni were reductively extracted into the liquid-Cd phase, and the rare-earth elements and U into the liquid-Cd phase by adding Li reductant. These elements were completely separated from the alkaline-earth elements remaining in the chloride phase.

This study analyzes the extent to which the "mixed oxide (MOX) option" and "immobilization option"! which were agreed to as the disposition options by the two countries, meets the SFS. The analysis confirms that the two options meet the SFS and are comparable to each other.

In this paper, some important factors (Th-232 content in soil and building material as well as building structure) relating to the level of indoor thoron and its progeny in China are reviewed. Limited results of small-scale surveys are also cited. The facts indicate that the public exposure from the inhalation of thoron progeny may be higher than the representative value in the UNSCEAR 1993 report, and thoron and its progeny may be a significant indoor pollutant in some regions or specific dwellings in China.
