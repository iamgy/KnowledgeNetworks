J	Ayaz, B; Bilge, AN				Ayaz, B; Bilge, AN			The possible usage of ex-ADU uranium dioxide fuel pellets with low-temperature sintering	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							UO2; MICROSTRUCTURE; DENSIFICATION; ATMOSPHERES; NIOBIA	UO2 fuel pellets are prepared conventionally by high- and low-temperature sintering. Both ex-ammonium uranyl carbonate (AUG) and ex-ammonium diuranate (ADU) UO2 are used in these techniques. Larger quantities of chemicals (NH, and CO2) are required for the AUG process which is a significant complication compared with the ADU process. In this work, it is aimed to search the important parameters such as theoretical density (TD) and grain size of ex-ADU UO2 pellets which are in an oxidative atmosphere at low temperature. A density of approximate to 95% TD is obtained at 1150 degrees C. The grain structure of the pellets sintered in an oxidative atmosphere is monomodal unlike the duplex grain structure of ex-AUG oxide, but it is in accord with ex-ammonium uranate (AU) oxide. The grain structure, distribution and size are compared with the ex-AUG and ex-AU conversion processes. It is shown that the grain structure development depends on both the powder properties and the sintering atmosphere. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Losonen, P				Losonen, P			On the behaviour of intragranular fission gas in UO2 fuel	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Review							CHEMICAL CONCENTRATION GRADIENTS; WATER-REACTOR FUEL; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; HIGH-BURNUP; NUCLEAR-FUEL; PRODUCT BEHAVIOR; BUBBLE-GROWTH; GRAIN-GROWTH; RE-SOLUTION; RELEASE	Data obtained from the literature concerning the behaviour of intragranular gas in sintered LWR UO2 fuel are reviewed comprehensively. The characteristics of single gas atoms and bubbles, as a function of irradiation time, temperature, fission rate and burn-up are described, based on the reported experimental data. The relevance of various phenomena affecting gas behaviour is evaluated. The current status of modelling of the behaviour of intragranular gas is considered in light of the present findings. Simple calculations showed that the conventional approximation for the effective diffusion coefficient does not adequately describe the gas behaviour under transient conditions, when bubble coarsening plays a key role in the release. The difference in the release fraction, compared with a more mechanistic approach, could be as large as 30%. A number of recommendations regarding possible defects in the mechanistic approach to modelling of intragranular gas are highlighted. The lack of an effective numerical method for solving the set of relevant non-linear differential equations is shown to be a serious obstacle in implementing the mechanistic models for fission gas release (FGR), in integral fuel performance codes.

J	Koo, YH; Lee, BH; Sohn, DS				Koo, YH; Lee, BH; Sohn, DS			Analysis of fission gas release and gaseous swelling in UO2 fuel under the effect of external restraint	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							WATER-REACTOR FUEL; NUCLEAR-FUEL; IRRADIATION; BURNUP; POWER; MODEL; BEHAVIOR	To analyze fission gas release and gaseous swelling in UO2 fuel, a model has been developed that can be used under both steady-state and transient operating conditions up to high burnup. With emphasis on the: effect of external restraint stress on the behavior of gas bubbles at grain boundaries, the gaseous swelling due to grain edge bubbles, which affects gas release rate through the formation of release tunnels at grain edge, is described. Gas release rate at the grain edge is assumed to be proportional to both the fraction of grain edge bubbles interlinked to open space of fuel and the rate of gas atoms arriving at the grain edge bubbles. The model was compared with the data obtained from commercial reactors, Ris phi-III Project, isothermal irradiation and post-irradiation annealing experiments. It is shown that the model predicts well the fractional fission gas release as well as the radial distribution of Xe gas across fuel pellet under various operating conditions. This suggests that the present model can be used for the analysis of fission gas release at high burnup fuel where strong external restraint stress may develop due to pellet cladding interaction.

The temperature factors for the metal atom, B-Pu and B-Th in the dioxides were evaluated by the Rietveld analysis. Debye temperature was calculated using the temperature factor. It was confirmed that the Debye temperature decreased with increasing temperature. From the temperature dependence of the Debye temperature, the Gruneisen constants were evaluated to be 1.62 for PuO2 and 1.51 for ThO2. The Debye temperatures modified for the thermal expansion of PuO2 and ThO2 were 429 and 463 K, respectively. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The formation of plutonium trioxide vapour is due to a chemical process involving oxygen adsorbed during oxidation of the sample. Although in the examined samples, the fraction of trioxide effusing in vacuo was of the order of 0.02 ppm of the plutonium content, under steady-state oxidation conditions it has been shown that the process can have a relevant effect on the sublimation rate of the dioxide.

The charge transfer cross sections of uranium R-ere experimentally examined. The cross sections of charge transfer for case A (between ground-state ions and atoms) and, cases B and C (between ions populated in some excited states and atoms) were relatively measured in the energy range of 100 2,000 eV by the cross-beam method. The charge transfer cross sections for cases A, B and C do not depend on impact energy, and the cross sections for case A are smaller than those for cases B and C. These results are in fairly good agreement agreed with theoretical predictions. It is confirmed experimentally and theoretically that the uranium charge transfer cross section depends on its initial ionic state, therefore ion loss by charge transfer will be reduced by controlling the initial state of the ions.

In order to achieve this, a study for decomposition reaction of oxalic acid by hydrogen peroxide was first carried out. The decumposition rates of H2O2 and oxalic acid increased with an increase of nitric acid concentration, and especially those decomposition rates steeply increased at more than 2 M HNOs. Based on this result, the decomposition kinetics of H2O2 and oxalic acid were suggested in this work. Then, the dissolution of oxalate precipitate and the destruction of oxalate ion in the solution were examined. Oxalate precipitates were prepared by adding oxalic acid into a simulated radioactive waste containing 8 metallic elements. The precipitates obtained thereby were dissolved in various nitric acid concentrations and reacted with H2O2 at 90 degrees C. When the oxalates were completely dissolved, most of the oxalates were decomposed by adding H2O2, but in a slurry state the decomposition yield of the oxalate decreased with an increase of the slurry density in the solution. Such phenomenon was considered to be due to it catalytic decomposition of H2O2 on a solid surface of oxalate and the decomposition mechanism was explained by a charge transfer from a surface of oxalate solid to H2O2, producing OH radicals which can destruct; H2O2 explosively. Accordingly, the experimental condition for the decomposition of the oxalate precipitates was found to be most favorable at 3 M HNO3 under tie initial concentrations of 0.2 M oxalate and 1 M H2O2. At 3 M HNO3, oxalate precipitates could be safely and completely dissolved ed, and almost decomposed. Additionally, it was observed that the presence of ferric ion in the solution largely affects the decomposition rate of solution. This could be explained by a chain reaction of hydrogen peroxide with ferric ion in the solution.

Calculated higher-actinide concentrations were compared to measured values from the literature for three reactor fuels. The fuel samples were taken from the Mihama Unit 3 pressurized water reactor, the Garigliano boiling water reactor, and a VVER-440. The Am-241 and Am-243 concentrations were calculated using the HELIOS-1.4 lattice-physics code, the ORIGEN2 burnup code, and a linked MCNP/ORIGEN2 code named Monteburns 3.01. Comparisons were made between the calculated and measured values. It was determined that all codes performed consistently well for the Mihama Unit 3 measurements (within +/- 5% for Am-241 and +/- 20% for Am-243) and the Garigliano measurements (within +/- 12% for Am-241 and +/- 12% for Am-243). It was determined that the ORIGEN2 pressurized water reactor libraries are insufficient for the VVER-440 measurements, The HELIOS and MONTEBURNS codes both demonstrated good ability to calculate these isotopes for VVER-440 fuel (+/- 10% for Am-241 and +/- 12% for Am-243). The accuracies of these codes and the associated radiochemical measurements of these higher-actinide isotopes may be insufficient for safeguards and fuel management purposes; thus, development, of new methods and modification to existing data libraries may be necessary in order to enable cost-effective safeguarding of these higher-actinide materials.

For responding to public concerns, the Japanese government is taking measures of developing the framework of the HLW disposal project such as preparing legislation and establishing the implementing entity. The activities for public acceptance of this project have been initiated recently. In the process of siting, the implementing entity will be required to gain public confidence in the safety of the disposal concept. This paper first summarizes the technical aspects of the HLW disposal projects in Various countries. Then, it discusses the issues for public perception of the safety of the HLW disposal with analyzing the case of the environmental assessment and review process for the nuclear fuel waste management and disposal concept administered in Canada and makes suggestions for future steps to be taken in Japan.

The TlBr photodetectors have been fabricated from the TlBr crystals grown by the TMZ method using materials purified by many pass zone refining. The performance of the photodetectors has been evaluated by measuring their leakage current, quantum efficiency, spatial uniformity, direct X-ray detection and scintillation detection characteristics. The photodetectors have shown high quantum efficiency for the blue wavelength region and high spatial uniformity for their optical response. In addition, good direct X-ray detection characteristics with an energy resolution of 4.5 keV FWHM for 22 keV X-rays from a Cd-109 radioactive source have been obtained. Detection of blue scintillation from GSO and LSO scintillators irradiated with a Na-22 radioactive source has been done successfully by using the photodetectors at room temperature. A clear full-energy peak for 511keV gamma-rays has been obtained with the TlBr photodetector coupled to the LSO scintillator with an energy resolution of 40% FWHM, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

In combination with some other described analyses, the detectors produced with the developed surface control are used in a PC - controlled scanning equipment reaching at room temperature an FWHM of 3.4 keV for Am-241.

Extensive work has been done on such fuels using various CdTe or CdZnTe probes. When fuels have to be measured after short cooling time (during NPP outage) the spectrum is much more complex due to the important contributions of niobium and zirconium in the 700 keV range. For the first time in a nuclear power plant, four pent fuels of the Kozloduy VVER reactor no 4 were measured during outage, 37 days after shutdown of the reactor. In such conditions, good resolution is of particular interest, so a 20 mm(3) hemispheric crystal was used with a resolution better than 7 keV at 662 keV. This payer presents the experimental device and analyzes the results which show that CdZnTe commercially available detectors enabled us to perform a semi-quantitative determination of the burn-up after a short cooling time. In addition, it is discussed how a burn-up evolution code (CESAR) coupled to a gamma transport code (MCNP) allows us to predict and interpret the experimental data from CdZnTe detectors. Particularly, bremsstrahlung contribution to the gamma spectra is suggested and modeled. Calculation results indicate a good agreement between this hypothesis and the present measurements.

In the case of highly alpha-active and sparingly available actinides-e.g., Pu-238, Pu-240 Am-243, and Cm-244-a novel recoil catcher technique to collect the fission products on a Lexan polycarbonate foil followed by gamma-ray spectrometry was developed during the course of this work. This completely removed interferences from (a) gamma rays of daughter products in secular equilibrium with the target nuclide (e.g., Am-243-Np-239), (b) activation products of the catcher foil [e.g., Na-24 from Al(n, alpha)], and (c) activation products of the target [e.g., Np-238 from Np-237(n, gamma) and Np-239 from U-238(n, gamma) reactions, making the gamma spectrometric analysis very simple and accurate. The high-yield asymmetric fission products were analyzed by direct gamma spectrometry, whereas the low-yield symmetric products (e.g., Ag, Cd, and Sb) as well as some of the asymmetric fission products (e.g., Br) and rare earths (in the case of U-238 and Np-237) were radiochemically separated and then analyzed by gamma-ray spectrometry. The neutron spectra in the irradiation positions of the reactors were measured and delineated in the thermal to 10-MeV region using threshold activation detectors. The present data were compared with the ENDF/VI and UKFY2 evaluated data files. From the measured cumulative yields, the mass-chain yields have been deduced using charge distribution systematics. The mass yields, along with similar data for other fast neutron-induced fissioning systems, show several important features: 1. Fine structure in the interval of five mass units in even-Z fissioning systems due to odd-even effects. The fine structure decreases from lighter to heavier even-Z actinides, in accordance with their odd-even effect. 2. Higher yields in the mass regions 133 to 135, 138 to 140, and 143 to 145 and their complementary mass regions, depending on the mass of the fissioning systems due to the presence of 82n-66n, 86n-62n, and 88n-56n shells. 3. For odd-Z fissioning systems having no odd-even effect, the fine structure is very feeble and is due only to shell effects. 4. Unusually high yields observed in the mass region 133 to 139 in the fissioning system U-239* as compared to other U isotopes are explained on the basis of a higher neutron-to-proton ratio (N/Z) of U-238 compared to lower-mass uranium isotopes. The <(upsilon)over bar>, full-width at tenth-maximum, and (A) over bar(L) increase with increasing mass of the fissioning systems, whereas (A) over bar(H) of -139 +/- 1 remains constant throughout due to the strong preference for the formation of the deformed 88n shell, which is also favorable from the N/Z point of view.

J	Park, SH; Lee, KW				Park, SH; Lee, KW			Lognormal size distribution theory for deposition of polydisperse aerosol particles	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							CONDENSATION; COAGULATION; MOLECULE	The moments method of the lognormal size distribution theory was applied to the deposition equation of a radioactive aerosol within a liquid-metal fast breeder reactor for analysis of postulated accidents. The deposition coefficient of Crump and Seinfeld was utilized to represent the Brownian and turbulent diffusions and the gravitational sedimentation. The deposition equation was converted into a set of three ordinary differential equations. This approach takes the view point that the size distribution of an aerosol is represented by a time-dependent lognormal size distribution function during the deposition process. Numerical calculations have been performed and the results were found to be in good agreement with the exact solution. The derived model for aerosol deposition is convenient to use in a numerical general dynamic equation solution routine based on the moments method, where nucleation, condensation, coagulation, and deposition need to be solved simultaneously.

The apparatus was used in the temperature gradient 1 (TG1) experiment to measure fission product releases from Zircaloy-sheathed irradiated Canada deuterium uranium (CANDU) UO2 fuel samples during fast temperature ramps in the presence of a radial temperature gradient in the fuel. The ohmic heating of the UO2, combined with surface heat removal by the surrounding helium coolant flow, produced a radial temperature profile that approximates the profile for fission- or decay-heated fuel. The II tests conducted in the TG1 experiment simulated various transient heating rates and high temperature annealing conditions. The results indicate that the DEH technique can produce large radial temperature gradients and rapid heating rates. Ceramographic examinations showed columnar grain growth and Evidence of UO2 melting. Chemical interactions between the tungsten electrodes and the UO2 were also observed. Releases of krypton, and release and redistribution of cesium were measured. Fission product release and redistribution results from some of the tests are also reported. The Kr measurements irrdicated that the amount of Kr released was highly dependent upon the peak dwell power: The higher the dwell power, the higher the cumulative release. The redistribution of cesium was mapped using emission gamma radiography of the fuel specimen after the rest. Cesium was released from the center of the fuel sample where temperatures Merr rite highest. A well-defined area was confirmed near the center Kr where the Cs activity was depleted The measured Kr releases were in good agreement with the Cs migration and release.

The inventory measurements of the individual particles were carried out before and after the heating rests with gamma-ray spectrometry to study the behavior of the individual particles. The time-dependent release behavior of Kr-85, Ag-110m, Cs-134, Cs-137, and Eu-154 were obtained with on-line measurements of fission gas release and intermittent measurements of metallic fission product release during the heating tests. The inventory measurements of the individual particles revealed that fission product release behavior of the individual particles was not uniform, and large particle-to-particle variations in the release behavior of Ag-110, Cs-134, Cs-137, and Eu-154 were found X-my microradiography and ceramography showed that the variations could not be explained by only the presence or absence of cracks in the SiC coating layer The SiC degradation may have been related to the variations.

In addition, a kinetic model for calculating the corrosion rates of UO2 in solutions undergoing radiolysis is discussed. The model gives good agreement between calculated and measured corrosion rates in the case of gamma radiolysis and in unirradiated solutions containing dissolved oxygen or hydrogen peroxide. However, the model fails to predict the results of alpha radiolysis. In a recent study, it was shown that the model gave goon agreement with measured corrosion rates of spent fuel exposed in deionized water The applications of radiolysis studies for geologic disposal of used nuclear fuel are discussed.

J	Lee, SY; Sindelar, RL; Losey, DC				Lee, SY; Sindelar, RL; Losey, DC			Thermal modeling and performance analysis of interim dry storage and geologic disposal facilities for spent nuclear fuel	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								Thermal models are constructed and analyses are performed of aluminum-based spent nuclear fuel (Al-SNF) in interim dry storage and geologic disposal configurations. Two models are developed referred to as the interim storage model and the codisposal waste package (WP) model. Time-dependent source terms of Al-SNF forms and the defense high-level waste (DHLW) canisters are also developed for thermal performance analysis of the geologic codisposal WP. The interim storage model is a three-dimensional conduction-convection conjugate model to investigate the natural convection cooling of a sealed dry storage canister with vertical orientation in a dry storage vault. The analysis is made for various decay heat sources (Equivalent to 25 to 35 kW/m(3)) using various boundary conditions around the canister wall and,with backfilled nitrogen or helium gas. Based on the data obtained from the Savannah River Site experimental work and available from the literature, an improved dimensionless correlation for the external heat transfer of the canister by the airflow crossing normal to the staggered tubes is developed. The codisposal WP model considers heat transfer driven by conduction and convection processes combined with radiation for the thermal performance study of an enclosed WP containing one Al-SNF canister and five DHLW glass canisters. Two-dimensional analysis for a representative cross-sectional area of the codisposal WP is performed because each component has a lar ge aspect ratio of package length to diameter and the package is laid down horizontally in a drift tunnel repository. The results showed that the codisposal disposition options for the helium- and air-filled WPs satisfied the present waste acceptance criteria for the WP design under the reference conditions.

The concentrations of some elements and their ratio respond to changes of the climate. Sr/Ba, Sr/Rb, Sr/Cs, Sr/Fe, Sr/Ti, U/Th, Zn/Nb, Mo, Eu, Y, Yb positively correlate with the content of biogenic silica (BiSi) which is high at intervals belonging to interglacials and small at those belonging to glacials. On the contrary Ba, Rb, Cs, Th, La, Ce, Nd, La (Ce)/Yb (Y, Zr) negatively correlate with BiSi. These two series of geochemical signals, along with BiSi, reflect oscillations of the climate between glacials and interglacials. Spectral analysis of the records revealed that they are modulated by orbital forcing. This proves that the climates of East Siberia depend on orbital forcing to the similar extent, as does the global climate. Comparison of the climate records found in the sediments of Lake Baikal with the pattern of orbital parameters made it possible to estimate the mean rates of sediment accumulation over different time intervals and to refine the age-depth model.

The concentrations of the two elements mentioned were measured by X-ray fluorescent analysis with synchrotron radiation (SR-XFA) at 10 cm intervals. Br correlates positively, and Nd negatively with BiSi. Spectral analysis of the profiles revealed the 100, 41, 23 and 19 kyr major external forcing periods. We studied the elemental composition of extant diatom algae of Lake Baikal in order to find out whether any elements are bound by them specifically. SR-XFA revealed, among others that Br is accumulated by extant diatom algae of Lake Baikal, presumably due to incorporation into their organic matter. Br can be regarded as a new proxy of the paleo-productivity of Lake Baikal. The paper also considers arguments suggesting that the first 2 m of sediment are missing in the BDP-96-2 core.

With certain contents of these elements and insufficient resolution of the spectrometer, this leads to considerable errors of determination. An example is the overlapping of a large number of uranium (U) L-lines and Rb, Nb, Mo K-lines. In this paper a procedure is suggested to correct such overlapping. It was tested on uranium-containing rock samples. These samples represent the oil-producing Bazhenov rock formation, which is characterized by organic matter accumulated in abundance and accompanied by "organophile" elements, including U, The procedure is based on scanning the energy of initial exciting X-radiation. This may be regarded advisable only in the XFA versions that use synchrotron radiation - SR-XFA. As a result of this investigation, geochemical characteristics of the Bazhenov formation rocks are demonstrated and the efficiency of energy scanning procedure in determining both Rb, Nb, Mo and U contents is revealed (using comparison with other methods). The energy scanning procedure also works in the presence of L-lines of some other dark elements (Pb, Th, etc.) in the energy domain of K-lines of As-Mo. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The 1(+) ions from the surface ionization source are decelerated and focused onto the ECRIS plasma so that they can be efficiently trapped there and further ionized to charge state q > 1(+). A scheme for stepwise and gradual deceleration of the 1(+) ion beam consisting of a multi-electrode decelerator and a tuning electrode placed before the ECRIS has been optimized. The beam dynamics calculations show that the 1(+) beam decelerated to energies of 20-50 eV could be focused to a spot size smaller than the radial dimensions of the ECR plasma zone.

To determine the optimum conditions for plating plutonium, the effects of electrolyte concentration, chelating reagent, current, pH of electrolyte and the time of plating on the electrodeposition were investigated on the base of the ammonium oxalate-ammonium sulfate electrolyte containing diethyl triamino pentaacetic acid. An optimized electrodeposition procedure for the determination of plutonium was validated by application to environmental samples. The chemical yield of the optimized method of electrodeposition step in the environmental sample was a little higher than that of Talvitie's method. The developed electrodeposition procedure in this study was applied to determine the radionuclides such as thorium, uranium and americium that the electrodeposition yields were a little higher than those of the conventional method.

J	Vargas, MJ				Vargas, MJ			A model to explain simultaneously the Rn-222 and Rn-220 emanation from thin electrodeposited sources	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article							RADIUM; SPECTROMETRY; RA-226	In thin radioactive sources, loss of radon by emanation is a very common phenomenon, especially in sources made by electrodeposition. A quantification of this effect in radium sources can be easily developed by using a simple model that assumes a radon diffusion term in the ingrowth equations. By measuring the corresponding Rn/Ra activity ratio, a constant diffusion factor can be determined which represents the Rn emanation from the whole source. However, this simple model cannot explain simultaneously the Rn-222 and Rn-220 diffusion produced in a thin source, because it gives diffusion factors that are different by many orders of magnitude for these two isotopes, while these values must be fairly close. In this paper, a new model of diffusion is proposed, which includes a linear dependence of the diffusion factor on the depth of Rn nuclides in the sourer. This new model has been applied to radium electrodeposited sources and allows us to explain satisfactorily both the Rn-220/Ra-224 and Rn-226/Ra-226 activity ratios observed in thin sources.

The following parameters were evaluated and compared between postulated mixed thorium-uranium dioxide standard and annular (9% void fraction) type fuel assemblies, as a function of burnup: the infinite multiplication factor, the uranium and plutonium isotopic compositions, the fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity and the conversion ratio. We used the SCALE-4.3 code system. The calculation method consisted in obtaining actinide and fission product number densities as functions of assembly burnup, by means of a 1-D transport calculation combined with a 0-D burnup calculation. These number densities were then used in a 3-D Monte Carlo code for obtaining k(infinity) from two-dimensional-symmetry "snapshots". (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Jo, CK; Cho, NZ; Kim, YH				Jo, CK; Cho, NZ; Kim, YH			Graphite-filled mixed-oxide fuel design for fully loaded PWR cores	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							PLUTONIUM	In order to maximize the benefit of plutonium recycling in the current light water reactor (LWR) cores, recently, many researches have been performed for 100% mixed-oxide (MOX) core. However, when the LWR core is fully loaded with MOX fuel, several problems arise due to the spectrum hardening effect of the plutonium isotopes. In order to overcome the spectrum hardening effect, we propose a new fuel design for full MOX core, that consists of annular fuel material filled internally with graphite. The new design is compatible with the conventional assembly in its overall geometry, and therefore it may require only minor modifications from the conventional fuel technology. The results of assembly and core analysis with the graphite-filled MOX fuel rods indicate that the new fuel design provides desirable characteristics, namely, higher burnup with less fuel inventory, faster depletion of plutonium and less production of actinides, and better safety features in fuel temperature, control rod worth, boron worth, moderator temperature coefficient (MTC), and shutdown margin. These beneficial results come from the enhanced moderation of the neutrons due to the moderating power of graphite and its contribution to the increased moderator/fuel volume ratio.

In the first step highly enriched gaseous oxygen-18 is irradiated with protons to form fluorine-18 which gets deposited on the inner target surface. In the second step, after cryogenic recovery of oxygen-18 target gas, a mixture of elemental 'cold' fluorine and krypton is introduced and a short proton irradiation is done, whereby an isotopic exchange between the gaseous fluorine and the deposited radiofluorine occurs. The second step leads to the recovery of the radiofluorine as [F-18]fluorine. Optimisation studies were performed regarding the yield and specific radioactivity of [F-18]fluorine. Furthermore, some irradiation parameters relevant to the recovery step were investigated. It was found that a 15 to 20 min irradiation with a beam current of 20 CIA is sufficient for the isotopic exchange between the fluorine-carrier and the F-18-radioactivity deposited on the inner wall of the target. The distribution of the F-18-radioactivity deposited on the inner target surface is inhomogeneous, probably due to convection effects. Extensive radioanalytical techniques were applied to characterise the reactivity of [F-18]fluorine and to identify undesired nonreactive F-18-compounds, mainly [F-18]tetrafluoromethane and [F-18]nitrogentrifluoride. The [F-18]fluorine produced in the system used has the distinction of having a negligible contamination from those inert F-18-compounds. This is a combined effect of the use of highest purity gases and a welded target construction, which avoids any contact of the gases with organic material during irradiations.

The model agrees with the physical concepts concerning the mechanisms of athermal diffusion and radiation re-solution of gas bubbles. The model makes it possible to explain the experimentally observed sharp irradiation temperature dependence of gas release at low temperatures, even though the athermal radiation-stimulated transfer mechanisms predominate. The model was integrated into a mechanistic RTOP code and verified on experimental data, including Halden project data.

J	Makhon'ko, KP				Makhon'ko, KP			Effect of wind uplift of radioactive dust from the ground on the contamination of the atmosphere above the territory of Russia	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The character of the time variation of the average yearly concentration of Cs-137 in the near-ground atmosphere of the USSR and Russia in 1954-1999 as well as the special features of the yearly variation of the average monthly concentration in 1981-1985 after the last nuclear explosion in the atmosphere (1980) are examined. The role of wind uplift of radioactive dust from the ground in contamination of the air near the ground by Cs-137 after powerful nuclear explosions in the atmosphere were discontinued and after the Chernobyl accident in 1986 is discussed. It is shown that in the last few years the Cs-137 concentration in the air at the ground is almost completely due to wind uplift from the dry ground and advection on a global scale. The coefficients of wind uplift and deflation, the velocity of wind uplift, and the size of aerosol particles - Cs-137 carriers - are estimated.

J	Knebel, JU; Heusener, G				Knebel, JU; Heusener, G			Research on transmutation and accelerator-driven systems at the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			English	Article								Transmutation is considered a promising technology worldwide for significantly reducing the amount and, thereby, the long-term radiotoxicity of high active waste (HAW) produced by the operation of nuclear power plants such as light water reactors (LWR). The maximum reduction of radiotoxicity could be by a factor of about 100. Transmutation is thus an alternative to the direct deposition of large volumes of highly radioactive waste. Transmutation presents the possibility of closing the fuel cycle including the minor actinides. Plutonium, minor actinides and long-lived fission products can be transmuted in a so called Accelerator Driven Sub-critical System (ADS), which consists of an accelerator, a target module and a subcritical blanket. This paper describes the work performed at Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe which is critically evaluating an ADS mainly with respect to its potential for transmuting minor actinides, to its feasibility and to safety aspects. The work is being done in the area of core design, neutronics, safety, system analyses, materials and corrosion.

This is often the case in health physics measurements, and the false positive fraction (the fraction of results measuring positive that are actually zero) is often very large using the prescriptions of classical statistics. Bayesian statistics pro,ides a methodology to minimize the number of incorrect decisions (wrong calls): false positives and false negatives. We present the basic method and a heuristic discussion. Examples are given using numerically generated and real bioassay data for tritium. Various analytical models are used to fit the prior probability distribution in order to test the sensitivity to choice of model, parametric studies show that for typical situations involving rare events the normalized Bayesian decision level k(alpha) = L-c/sigma(0) ilhero sigma(0) a is the measurement uncertainty for zero true amount, is in the range of 3 to 5 depending on the true positive rate. Four times sigma(0) rather than approximately two times a,, as in classical statistics, mould seem a better choice for the decision level in these situations.

Sites, impacted by windblown tailings and mill dust, had significantly higher concentrations of uranium, Ra-226, Pb-210, and (210)po in soils, litter, vegetation, tree needles and twigs, small mammals, and birds, compared to a control site. Samples were collected from both upland jackpine and black spruce bog habitats in triplicate at each site. Both habitats were similar in radionuclide accumulation. Absorbed doses averaged 0.92, 8.4, and 4.9 mGy y(-1) to small mammals and 2.0, 5.8, and 2.8 mGy y(-1) to Lincloln's sparrows at the control, tailings, and mill sites, respectively. These doses do not include doses from short-lived radon progeny. The majority of the dose increment at the tailings and mill sites was due to 226Ra, whereas it was Po-210 at the control site. Thus, use of a radiation weighting factor of 20 for alpha radiation raised equivalent doses (in mSv y(-1)) by nearly a factor of 20.

Plant/soil CRs, animal carcass/GI tract CRs, and animal/soil CRs were depressed at sites impacted by mill and tailings dusts relative to a nearby control site. Thus, radionuclides associated with large particulates in tailings and/or ore dusts may be less bioavailable to terrestrial plants and animals than natural sources of radioactive dust. These results show that reliance on default food chain transfer parameters, obtained from uncontaminated terrestrial ecosystems, may overpredict impacts at uranium mine and mill sites.

J	Thomas, PA				Thomas, PA			Radionuclides in the terrestrial ecosystem near a Canadian uranium mill - Part III: Atmospheric deposition rates (pilot test)	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						uranium; Ra-226; Pb-210; Po-210		Atmospheric deposition rates of uranium series radionuclides were directly measured at three sites near the operating Key Lake uranium mill in northern Saskatchewan. Sites impacted by windblown tailings and mill dusts had elevated rates of uranium deposition near the mill and elevated Ra-226 deposition near the tailings compared to a control site. Rainwater collectors, dust jars, and passive vinyl collectors previously used at the Ranger Mine in Australia were pilot-tested. Adhesive vinyl surfaces (1 m(2)) were oriented horizontally, vertically, and facing the ground as a means of measuring gravitational settling, wind impaction, and soil resuspension, respectively. Although the adhesive glue on the vinyls proved difficult to digest, relative differences in deposition mode were found among radionuclides and among sites. Dry deposition was a more important transport mechanism for uranium, Ra-226, and (210)pb than rainfall, while more Po-210 was deposited with rainfall.

J	Zanzonico, PB; Siegel, JA; St Germain, J				Zanzonico, PB; Siegel, JA; St Germain, J			A generalized algorithm for determining the time of release and the duration of post-release radiation precautions following radionuclide therapy	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						dosimetry; medical radiation; radiopharmaceuticals; regulatory guides	RECEIVING I-131 THERAPY; DOSE RATES; SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS; ADULT PATIENTS	The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has recently amended its regulation concerning patients who have received therapeutic amounts of radioactivity. The amended regulation allows patient release based on a total effective dose equivalent (TEDE) limit of 5 mSv (500 mrem) instead of the activity administered or retained [1,110 MBq (30 mCi)] or the dose rate [0.05 mSv h(-1) (5 mrem h(-1)) at 1 m], Record-keeping and written post-release radiation safety precautions are required, however, A general algorithm, combining patient-specific kinetics and dose rate measurements, has been developed to systematically determine the actual duration of post-release radiation precautions as well as the time of release posttreatment. This algorithm is based on the maximum permissible effective dose equivalents (MPEDEs) of the respective cohorts exposed, 5 mSv (500 mrem) to non-pregnant adult family members and 1 mSv (100 mrem) to pregnant women, children, and members of the general public, Operational equations to determine the times post-radionuclide treatment of release from medical confinement, of not working, of avoiding pregnant women and children, of limiting holding of children, and of sleeping partners riot sleeping together have been derived and illustrated with a hypothetical example, TEDE-based release criteria should be less restrictive than the previous activity-based or dose rate-based release criteria. Howe cer, post-release radiation precautions may be more intrusive and longer in duration than those to which most practitioners have grown accustomed. Up to now, however, the duration (typically 1-2 d) of advised post-release precautions had not been rigorously derived from MPEDEs and were generally inappropriately short. Even so, dose-based release criteria should prove more cost-effective overall than hospitalization of patients commonly imposed by activity-based and dose rate-based release criteria.

J	Zanzonico, PB; Becker, DV				Zanzonico, PB; Becker, DV			Effects of time of administration and dietary iodine levels on potassium iodide (KI) blockade of thyroid irradiation by I-131 from radioactive fallout	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						I-131; dosimetry; thyroid; fallout	CHERNOBYL ACCIDENT; CANCER; BLOCKING	Radioiodines, particularly (131), may be released into the environment in breach-of-containment nuclear reactor accidents and localize in and irradiate the thyroid with an attendant risk of neoplastic growth and other adverse health effects. Pharmacologic thyroid blockade by oral potassium iodide (KI) (50-100 mg in adults) can substantially reduce thyroid uptake of and irradiation by internalized radioiodine, In the current analysis, computer modeling of iodine metabolism has been used to systematically elucidate the effects of two practically important but highly variable factors on the radioprotective effect of KI: the time of administration relative to exposure to radioiodine and the dietary level of iodine. In euthyroid adults receiving iodine-sufficient diets (250 mu g d(-1) in the current analysis), KI administered up to 48 h before I-131 exposure can almost completely block thyroid uptake and therefore greatly reduce the thyroid absorbed dose. However, KI administration 96 h or more before I-131 exposure has no significant protective effect. In contrast, KI administration after exposure to radioiodine induces a smaller and rapidly decreasing blockade effect. KI administration 16 h or later after I-131 exposure,Fill have little effect on thyroid uptake and absorbed dose and therefore little or no protective effect. The I-131 thyroid absorbed dose is two-fold greater with insufficient levels of dietary iodine, 2,900 cGy/37 hlBq, than with sufficient levels of dietary iodine, 1500 cG2/37 hlBq. When KI is administered 38 h or less before I-131 intake, the thyroid absorbed doses (in cGy/37 MBq) are comparably. low with both sufficient and insufficient dietary iodine levels. When KI is administered after I-131 intake, however, the protective effect of I(I is less and decreases more rapidly with insufficient than with sufficient dietary iodine. For example, KI administration 2 and 8 h after I-131 intake yields protective effects of 80 and 40%, respectively, with iodine-sufficient diets, but only 65 and 15% with iodine-deficient diets. In conclusion, whether exposed populations receive sufficient or insufficient dietary iodine, oral I(I is an effective means of reducing thyroid irradiation from enviromnentally dispersed radioiodine but is effective only when administered within 2 d before to -8 h after radioiodine intake.

The toxic effects of uranium can be reduced by the administration of a biphosphonate, ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-biphosphonate (EHBP), subcutaneously or intraperitoneally. The aim of the present work was to examine whether orally administered EHBP reduces the lethal effect of a single orally administered toxic dose of uranyl nitrate, Nine groups of 20 male Balb-c mice mere used, Five groups received 350 mg kg(-1) of uranyl nitrate orally administered by gavage, four were co-treated 20 min later with EHBP either by gavage (350, 500, or 700 mg kg(-1)) or by subcutaneous injection (50 mg kg(-1)), and one group was not treated, Four groups of animals received only EHBP in doses and routes the same as those used in the intoxicated animals. Survival was assessed for 14 d, On day 14 the surviving animals of all groups were killed, An additional group of uranium intoxicated animals was killed on day 2 after the start of the experiment, Kidneys were examined histologically, On day 3 all the animals treated with uranyl nitrate alone and 20% of the animals treated with 700 mg kg(-1) of EHBP alone were dead. Survival at day 14 of the groups of mice intoxicated with uranyl nitrate and treated with EHBP (50 mg kg(-1) orally or 50 mg kg(-1) subcutaneously) was 45.0 and 49.6%, respectively, Tubule necrosis lesions were present in kidneys of mice intoxicated with uranyl nitrate, whereas lesions were less severe in mice treated with EHBP. Oral administration of EHBP is effective for reducing the lethal effect of uranium, and it is at least as useful as subcutaneous administration for prompt therapy of oral uranium exposure, achieving a survival rate of almost 50%.

A dose modifying factor (DMF), which is a ratio of the average nuclear dose to the whole-tissue dose, after skin-contact exposure of rats to tritiated pump oil or tritiated formaldehyde was estimated, Biokinetic data characterizing the retention of tritium in liver were available in the form of tritium-specific activities and biological half-times for tritiated water and five macromolecular species (DNA, RNA, acid-soluble fraction, acid-insoluble protein, and lipids). The spatial distribution of tissue-free water and macromolecular species in the nucleus and cytoplasm of rat liver cells was based on published data. In the case of exposure to tritiated pump oil, tritium incorporated into lipids provides the largest percentage (60%) of the absorbed dose to the nucleus. For the tritiated-formaldehyde exposure, the tritium dose to the nucleus is overwhelmingly contributed by tritiated water (58%) and in acid-insoluble proteins (40%). For both these tritiated organic exposures, the tritium-labeled DNA has a negligible effect on the DMF. The DMF for the tritiated pump oil and formaldehyde exposures was estimated as 0.81 and 1.05, respectively: the DMF of both exposures was close to unity. Given the other uncertainties in tritium dosimetry, our results suggest that for these skin-contact exposures a uniform distribution of tritium in tissue is an adequate assumption For dosimetry.

Comparison by Fisher's Exact Test of lifetime fracture occurrence in the skeletons of beagles injected as young adults suggested that for animals given Ra-226, Ra-228, Th-228, or Pu-239 citrate, there was probably an excess over controls in fractures of the ribs, leg bones, spinous processes, and pelvis (os coxae) plus the mandible for dogs given Ra-226 and the scapulae for dogs given Ra-228 or Th-228, Regression analysis indicated that significantly elevated fracture occurrence was especially notable at the higher radiation doses, at about 50 Gy average skeletal dose for Pu-239, 140 Gy for Ra-226, about 40 Gy for Ra-228, and more than 15 Gy for Th-228, The average number of fractures per dog was significantly elevated over that noted in controls for the highest radiation doses of Pu-239 and Ra-226 and for the higher doses of Ra-228 and Th-228. For those dogs given Sr-90 citrate, there was virtually no important difference from control beagles not given radionuclides, even at group mean cumulative skeletal radiation doses up to 101 Gy, Because of a large proportion of dogs with fractures that died with bone malignancy (even at dosage levels lower than those exhibiting an excess average number of fractures per dog), we conclude that fracture would not be an important endpoint at lower levels of plutonium contamination in humans such as would be expected to occur from occupational or environmental exposure.

Tree-ring cellulose analyses were carried out for retrospective evaluation of H-3 and C-14 in the environment around the Wolsong Nuclear Power Plants. H-3 released from the Wolsong Nuclear Power Plants has affected an area up to a 25-km radius from the site, while almost all C-14 was deposited within a 2-km radius, reaching to a natural level over 2 km, Organically bound tritium concentrations in tree rings were strongly correlated with the gaseous tritium discharge rate, while Delta(14)C (excess) in tree rings ranged from 204 parts per thousand to 460 parts per thousand, which did not significantly vary with year.

These comparisons determined an optimum time interval of meteorological data used with atmospheric dose models at the Savannah River Site (SRS), Meteorological data of varying time intervals (1 y to 10 y) were used for the comparison. Insignificant differences are seen in using a 1-y database as opposed to a 5-y database. Use of a 10-y database results in slightly higher or more conservative estimates. For meteorological databases of length 1 y to 5 y the mean ratio of predicted to measured tritium oxide concentrations is approximately 1.25 whereas for the 10-y database the ratio is closer to 1.35. Currently at the SRS a meteorological database of five year's duration is used for all dose models. This study suggests no substantially improved accuracy using shorter or longer time intervals.

The selected site was the Stationary Low-Power Reactor No, 1 burial ground at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. Evaluation was restricted to Cs-137 in the uppermost 10 cm of potentially contaminated soils. According to the MARSSIM, this site warranted a "Class 1" designation based on previous remedial activities within the burial ground, its status as a radioactive disposal facility, and the anticipated presence of discrete radioactive particles. Nine survey units within the confines of the burial ground were selected, based primarily on the presence of physical boundaries and disparate histories. Surface sums with 100% coverage were performed using a hand-held plastic scintillator and rate meter with audible output. bt situ gamma-ray spectrometry was not used for the individual stationary measurements due to the limited area and proximity of engineered barriers, Instead, individual soil samples were obtained using a standard hand-held coring de,ice. The number of soil samples taken from the background reference area and each survey unit were determined with the MARSSIM protocol which resulted in a total of 160 (including quality-control samples), Two of the nine regions exhibited elevated radiation levels and the null hypothesis could not be rejected in one survey unit, thereby indicating the need for additional remediation, The MARSSIM process proved to be flexible, scientifically rigorous, and cost effective in this held application Several modifications to the procedure are discussed and offered as recommendations for enhancement of the MARSSIM.

J	Richardson, JM				Richardson, JM			A calorimeter for the nondestructive assay of tritium-contaminated samples	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Nuclear Science Symposium (NSS)	OCT 26-28, 1999	SEATTLE, WASHINGTON				NEUTRON-FLUX	Science Research Laboratory, Inc. has developed a cryogenic method for accurately assaying tritium within solid materials such as metals (see Figure 1). The apparatus has been thermally tested and delivered to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, where it will be further refined and calibrated. The current design has a demonstrated thermal sensitivity of 5 mu W, which corresponds to a tritium activity of 150 mCi (6 GBq). Minor modifications should improve the sensitivity by a factor of ten (10). The absolute accuracy is expected to be 0.5%, The apparatus is based on a mechanical refrigeration system that offers a base temperature of 7.5 kelvin. Existing non-calorimetric tritium assay methods are sensitive to surface contamination or require that the tritium be removed from the sample. In comparison, calorimetry is sensitive to contamination throughout the sample and requires little sample preparation so long as the sample can be cooled to cryogenic temperatures. In addition to the assay of tritium, the method may be applicable to other radioisotopes including P-33 and I-125.
