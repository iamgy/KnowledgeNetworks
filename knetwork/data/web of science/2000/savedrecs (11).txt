There were several objectives for this work: (i) to validate the U-235/U-238 isotopic ratios obtained by these techniques; (ii) to test the use of the U-235/U-238 ratio of uraninite as a tracer of migration/retention processes of uranium from the source term to the far field; (iii) to evaluate the most recent migration/retention processes of uranium in the system by U-series disequilibrium.

J	Surbeck, H				Surbeck, H			Alpha spectrometry sample preparation using selectively adsorbing thin films	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	ICRM Low-Level Radioactivity Measurement Techniques Conference	OCT, 1999	MOL, BELGIUM	Int Comm Radionuclide Metrol		radium; uranium; alpha spectrometry; selective adsorption		Several years ago, Switzerland introduced limits fbr natural radionuclides in food, e.g. 1 Bq/l for Ra-226 or 10 Bq/l for the sum of U-238 and U-234 in drinking water. To make enforcement by regional (cantonal) laboratories more attractive, simplified analytical methods had to be offered, at least for drinking water. A first step has been the development of radium adsorbing sheets. A 20 mm x 20 mm MnO2 film on a polyamide substrate adsorbs more than 80% of the radium present in a 100 ml water sample within 6 h. The film is thin enough to allow for high resolution alpha spectrometry. A second step now under way is to produce thin films, which selectively adsorb uranium. Actually, an ion exchange resin with diphosphonic and sulfonic acid groups is used for this purpose. Although not yet Very thin, these films make possible energy resolutions far better than with any liquid scintillation alpha spectrometry method. Adsorption efficiencies are more than 80% after 20 h exposition to a 100 mi water sample (20 mm x 20 mm sheet). A third step is to have a system that measures radionuclide concentrations in water on-line. A prototype is presented where radionuclides are adsorbed on a film in contact with the water. A Si-detector placed on the other side of the film support counts the alphas passing through. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Studies have been carried out to obtain the Sr-90 distribution in environment in order to estimate its;impact in terms of radiation exposure to humans. The Laboratory routinely measures Sr-90 by proportional counter after radiochemistry. An incomplete radiochemical separation leads to a deposit submitted to count polluted by natural beta-emitters. In order to confirm the result, Y-90 (daughter of Sr-90), is extracted from the final radiochemical fraction and counted. The Y-90 decreasing (T-1/2 = 2.67 days) is checked by successive counts over 64 h. The delay between the end of radiochemistry and the counting is imposed by 15 days to allow radioactive equilibrium between Sr-90 and Y-90 to be established. In order to remove this delay the purity of the 90Sr fraction source can be verified by beta-spectrometry. Thus, a beta-spectrometer is under development in collaboration with Canberra Semi-Conductor and Canberra Electronic. It consists in a PIPS detector where several silicon layers are combined. Initial results will be presented in this paper. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The method is based on the use of Ra-225, in radioactive equilibrium with its parent Th-229, as yield tracer. This tracer permits the incorporation of Ra-226 determination into the radiochemical procedure commonly used for the determination of U and Th isotopes in the same sample. Estimation of Ra-225 in the alpha-spectra is made via measurement of its alpha-emitting daughters, At-217 being the most suitable to this purpose. In order to achieve it, several requirements need to be fulfilled in the radiochemical procedure, which will be discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Due to its long half-life (1600 years) and radiological effects it is one of the most important isotopes to be determined among the naturally occurring nuclides in environmental samples. It is also among the most toxic long-lived alpha-emitters present in environmental samples, as well as one of the most widespread. The requirement for the determination of radium has become a matter of interest in public health due to its hazardous nature with respect to internal exposure. If is concentrated in bones, thus increasing the internal radiation dose of individuals. The methodology developed involves dissolving solid samples by microwave digestion. The radium is then separated from matrix interferents by cation exchange chromatography and subsequently electrodeposited onto a stainless steel disc. alpha-Spectrometry is employed to determine the activity in the sample. A limit of detection of 20 mBq l(-1) for ground water samples (100 ml) and 20 mBq g(-1) for solid samples (0.1 g) is achievable. The method has been validated via an intercomparison exercise and analysis of a marine sediment reference material. Samples analysed include run off waters from uranium mines, coal and fly ash and also trapping media such as silica gel, charcoal and activated carbon. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The method has been tested using 90Sr/90Y solutions with activities lower than 12 Bq. The source is eluted in a pH = 6.5 medium through a MnO2-impregnated cotton filter, where Y-90 is preconcentrated in preference by adsorption. 90Y is extracted from the column with hydroxylamine, some Sr-90 in the leached solution has also been found. After the radiochemical separation, the total beta-activity of the leached solution has been determined using a low background alpha-beta proportional counter and. assuming the presence of Sr-90 and Y-90 at t = 0, the solution of the Bateman equations allows the initial concentration of both isotopes to be obtained. We have verified that the addition of some ions usually found in water samples (Cl-, HCO3-, NO3-, SO42-, Ca2+, Mg2+) does not interfere with the yield of the radiochemical process, (90 +/- 10)%. The method has been applied to Sr-90/Y-90 determination in mineral waters, and even in thermal waters, where the salt concentration can be about 3500 mg/l, the radiochemical yield remains greater than 80%.

Studies have been carried out to obtain the Sr-90 distribution in environment in order to estimate its impact in terms of radiation exposure to humans. Various environmental samples were collected and analysed for Sr-90 activity concentrations. As natural beta emitters are present in all matrices, an incomplete radiochemical separation leads to over evaluation of the results. An accurate and reliable method has been routinely implemented to extract, purify, and analyse Sr-90 in all types of environmental matrices by the Laboratory of Radioactive Measurement in Environment. The radiochemical procedure is combined with a proportional counting for 90Sr detection. After leaching the 20 g aliquot, different protocols have been tested. The effectiveness of Sr-spec(R) resin for Sr isolation has been demonstrated and chosen for the protocol selected. Radiochemical procedure was tested using IAEA reference materials. Results are discussed in terms of recovery, purification efficiency and limit of detection. The influence of a filtrated atmosphere on proportional counting is also discussed.

Historically, techniques such as precipitation, ion exchange and solvent extraction have been used but these methods can be complex, time consuming and produce large amounts of chemical waste. A more environmental friendly sequential scheme for their determination in power station effluent using extraction chromatography has been developed. This is a simplified method which minimises chemical waste and makes use of commercially available pre-packed chromatography columns. An Eichrom TRU(.)Spec(R) column was used for the separation of isotopes of plutonium from americium and curium followed in sequence by an Eichrom Sr(.)Spec(R) column for the separation of Sr-90, The isolated actinides were prepared for alpha spectrometry analysis by electrodeposition and Sr-90 was analysed by liquid-scintillation counting. The tracers Pu-242, Am-243 and Sr-85 were used to measure chemical yields. Method evaluation was carried out on water samples spiked with certified radionuclide standards to determine precision, accuracy, detection limits and chemical recoveries. Finally, testing and evaluation of the method was carried out on power station effluent. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Due to the depth of 925 m below ground (equivalent to about 2100 m of water), the cosmic ray muon intensity in this facility is reduced by more than 5 orders of magnitude. In addition, the low specific activity of the pure rock salt and a low concentration of radon lead to an extremely low ambient dose equivalent rate of less than 1 nSv/h. The UDO facility is therefore well suited for dosimetry at very low dose rates, as well as for Ultra-Low-Background (ULB) gamma-ray spectrometry. In 1998, a coaxial low-background HPGe-detector (88% relative efficiency, FWHM 2.0 keV at 1.33 MeV) with an extended shielding (20 cm low-activity lead, 1 cm electrolytic copper, N-2-flushing) was installed at UDO; the count rate per mass of germanium, integrated over the energy range from 40 to 2750 keV, was measured to be 0.012 s(-1) kg(-1). Results from test measurements and first applications are reported. The design of a ULB gamma-detector system, presently under construction, is described. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The principle of TLA is the creation of an appropriate radionuclide in a given material to a well defined depth of a selected area. This activation is realised by exposure of the component to a charged particle beam using, e.g., a cyclotron facility. If the material is subjected to mechanical or chemical degradation, any loss of the activated material will result in a loss in radioactivity of the activated component. The sensitivity of TLA technique is high due to the capability of low level radioactivity measurement performed by gamma spectrometry. The sensitivity of TLA is below 0.1 mu m thickness loss or 1 ng mass loss. In the present paper, some applications of TLA in ongoing research at the Institute for Health and Consumer Protection of the European Commission are presented. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Particular emphasis was given to the evaluation of the background radiation. The apparatus was tested in the field at two selected areas in NW Italy. We found appropriate sites which could be used as reference targets to frequently check the gamma-ray equipment. An area formed by serpentinitic rocks showed such a low measured radioactivity that it could be used as a reference for the local background effect. An anomalously high uranium amount against negligible potassium and thorium concentrations were found in outcrops of dolomitic rocks, which can be used to detect possible changes in the instrument calibration constants.

In order to do this in a manner where the results of radiochemical analysis are traceable to national standards, a chemical yield tracer has to be employed. Th-229 has been identified as a suitable tracer for such purposes and has been used in the past. This paper describes the absolute standardisation of Th-229 by 4 pi alpha-gamma coincidence counting. The results of this work are presented together with an analysis of the standardisation uncertainties that were achieved in practice. (C) 2000 The National Physical Laboratory.

The area on which the animals were living had relatively high Chernobyl plutonium fallout. Possible traces of plutonium were seen only in four samples, but only for one it was it 3 sigma above background, at 6.2 +/- 2.4 mBq/kg (ash). The Am-241 activity concentration was below the detection limits in all samples. The maximum Th-228 concentration in the samples was 7.81 +/- 0.44 Bq/kg (ash), calculated under the assumption of 100% thorium recovery. This isotope seems to originate in bones not from direct incorporation but from the decay of Ra-228. Large variations in activity concentration wose observed, as well as some differences between boars and the chewing animals. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Special attention was paid to removing impurities of Th-228 which interferes in Pu-238 determination by alpha spectrometry. Two anion-exchange methods were compared. The determination of plutonium in soil involves the conversion of soil samples to acid-soluble form. Two methods for the extraction of plutonium from a natural reference soil were compared. The first method (a direct digestion in nitric acid) is suitable for the determination of plutonium in large amounts of sample. The second method involves microwave digestion of soil (5 g) with a mixture of HNO3, HCl and HF, and is suitable for saving time in routine determinations. Activities calculated with a reference soil matrix were in good agreement with the reference value. The microwave digestion method was applied in a study of different soil samples, and recoveries ranged between 20% and 50%. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Much of this is achieved by measurements in the workplace itself and by the bioassay and monitoring of workers in the industry. However, there also exists a significant 'non-nuclear' industry where workers are exposed to radioactive materials, for example where this involves thorium, which is made wide use of in the aerospace and other high technology industries. As such work involves the processing of thorium bearing materials, the workforce is potentially exposed to Th-232 and its daughter nuclides. Thus, to monitor the workforce effectively, it is important to be able to measure both Th-232 and the decay products of Th-232 where they are in an unknown state of radioactive equilibrium and this is where monitoring laboratories may experience some difficulty. Accordingly, the Health and Safety Laboratory in the UK has organized a EC wide project on the monitoring of thorium in the non-nuclear' workplace. this project is currently ongoing. We report the results of the first intercomparison of this project involving two solutions of Th-232, one in radioactive equilibrium and one not in equilibrium with its daughters. The results are presented with some comments on how this intercomparison has progressed and how these first results will inform the rest of the project. (C) 2000 The National Physical Laboratory.

These included different forms of manganese oxides, and specific organic ion-exchangers: HYPHAN and POLYORGS. In order to provide reproducible samples with moderate presence of possible interferences, spiked tap water was used for this first set of experiments. Results indicate that the sorption of Th, U, Pu and Am varies for different forms of manganese oxides. These variations are attributed to different physico-chemical properties of the oxides. HYPHAN was limited in its sorption to Th and U. The manganese oxide dissolved rapidly and the radiochemical separation procedure was quick and simple using extraction chromatography techniques. The radionuclides in the water samples were determined by ICP-MS and/or alpha spectrometry. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Comparisons were made between counters at the underground laboratory "Felsenkeller" (110 m water equivalent) and in an above ground laboratory (0 m water equivalent) of the TU Freiberg. In the underground laboratory, the background is strongly influenced by the beta-decay of the Rn-220-daughter Pb-212 (T-1/2 = 10.6 h) from the laboratory air, stimulating luminescence irradiation in the vial. The effective background count rate in the H-3-window (having subtracted the "luminescence effect") in the underground laboratory is two times lower than that in the above ground laboratory due to the better shielding of cosmic rays.

J	Carchon, R; Bruggeman, M; Majkowski, I				Carchon, R; Bruggeman, M; Majkowski, I			Non-destructive assay methods for the free release of dismantling wastes	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	ICRM Low-Level Radioactivity Measurement Techniques Conference	OCT, 1999	MOL, BELGIUM	Int Comm Radionuclide Metrol		non-destructive assay; free release measurements; dismantling waste		The determination of isotope specific activities, and above all, the identification of radioisotopes is an important issue in the waste management of nuclear wastes whatever their origin. Systems based on the detection of the gamma rays emitted by the radionuclides allow the non-destructive assay (NDA) of relatively large volumes of waste. Different NDA systems are commercially available for this purpose. NDA of waste items is subject to the influence of many different physico-chemical characteristics of the sample, most of which are generally not known. In many cases, however, NDA is the only approach that allows measuring these large samples. The unconditional free release of wastes originating from nuclear activities for a great deal relies on NDA systems and procedures for decision-making on free release. The assay of waste of very low activity and even the decision if a radionuclide has been detected or not, is very often difficult. The poor measurement precision, caused by the bad counting statistics, combined with a generally unknown bias of the measurement complicate the interpretation of the results, and accurate measurements are seldom obtained in these cases. The aim of the present paper is to give an overview of the efforts made at SCK-CEN to come to a consistent system that allows performing free release measurements, involving a high throughput of large amount of materials, as expected from a dismantling project.

Besides the activated materials which must be evacuated as radioactive waste, a large quantity of materials can either be recycled in the nuclear sector or free released as non-radioactive materials. Dismantling is a complex task so that to achieve our main goal of minimisation of radioactive waste production, it requires the set-up of procedures and free release criteria. a strict follow-up and a traceability at all steps. The free release of obsolete materials can be achieved by several processes such as, melting in a nuclear foundry, or by various physical and chemical decontamination processes. The final key point is the measurement of a very low level radioactivity for large items or for a high throughput. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Till some years ago, the decision measurements taken for the release were based only on determining the mass-specific activity of samples by means of gamma spectrometry and/or manual sequential measurements of the surface activity with large area gas flow counters. The choice of an appropriate measuring method, the layout of the release measurement facility (RMF), the way of preparing the material and the development of smart release procedures are very important for a large throughput and an economic performance of the release process. NIS and RADOS have developed RMF based on gross gamma activity. The NTS-RMFs have been applied for the last 10 years for decision measurements in different operated but also in dismantled nuclear power plants. Together with RMFs from RADOS. more than 12,000 Mg of various types of materials have been measured up to now with this method in Germany. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

One interest in the work is that the results can be used as a reference for the future evaluation of the effects produced by the restoration program. The radiological parameters selected to estimate the impact of the inactive mine were: Rn-222 in, air and water, Rn-222 exhalation, effective Ra-226 in soils and sediments, and natural uranium and Ra-226 in water. Chemical analyses of water samples and measurements of meteorological variables were also made. Average values of these radiological parameters are presented, We characterize the zone radiologically and estimate the influence of the mine on the basis of some of these parameters, while others are used to reflect the status of the installation, information which could be very useful in the near future when restoration is complete.

The establishment of decontamination and decommissioning programs is currently in progress at the nuclear power plant and monitoring procedures to assess workers' exposure have also been implemented. Due to the presence of transuranics, the monitoring program includes the analysis of excreta samples. An analytical method for the determination of plutonium (Pu) and americum (Am) in urine samples was developed. The radiochemical separation is based on the coprecipitation of transuranics and sequential isolation of Pu and Am by anion exchange and extraction chromatography. Finally, electrodeposited sources are prepared and counted by alpha-spectrometry. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Clearance levels are established by regulatory authorities and are normally quite low. Determination of those activity concentration levels becomes more difficult when it is necessary to quantify alpha emitters such as uranium, especially when complex matrixes are involved. In addition, an adequate workplace monitoring must be carried out during the decommissioning activities, to ensure the protection of workers involved in these tasks. Several methods for uranium determination in samples obtained during the decommissioning of a facility related to the first stage of the nuclear fuel cycle are presented in this work. According to the kind and sample size, together with the minimum detectable activity (MDA) that must be reached in each case, measurements were carried out by laboratory and 'in situ' gamma spectrometry, as well as by alpha spectrometry. A comparison among the different techniques was also performed by analysing the results obtained in some practical applications. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

To measure actinides in such samples, specific analytical protocols have been set up. The chemical purification uses different chromatographic columns to selectively separate the actinides and each fraction, after electroplating, is measured by alpha spectrometry. To reach 1 mBq l(-1) of U, Pu or Am using these protocols, 6 days equally distributed between the chemical purification and the measurement are necessary. The protocol proposed here is based on a single extractant, the 1,3,5-trimethoxy-2,4,6-tricarboxy-p-tert-butylcalix[6]arene, used to selectively separate U, Pu and Am from the urinary matrix prior to be measured. Using this analytical protocol, U and Pu are quantitatively and selectively recovered in two different acidic backextraction solutions whereas Am is quantitatively and selectively recovered in the organic phase. Furthermore, the purification stage is considerably shortened. The uranium and plutonium amounts are measured in aqueous phases using a spectrometry or inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, whereas Am is measured in the organic phase using a liquid scintillation (photon/electron-rejecting alpha liquid scintillation).

Heat is removed by means of medium-temperature (vanadium-potassium) heat pipes. Fast reactors with uranium dicarbide as fuel and carbon-graphite materials as the structural materials are examined for a large series. The thermoelectric generator consists of maximally unified electricity-generating elements using a metallic shunt as the interelectrode insulation.

J	Lauvergeon, A				Lauvergeon, A			The future of nuclear energy in Europe	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								More than 430 nuclear power plants are in operation in 33 countries worldwide. In 1999, they generated nearly 3.4 billion kilowatthours, thus meeting approximately one fifth of the world population's electricity requirement. Every third nuclear power plant is located in a member country of the European Union. These 145 plants generated an aggregate 826 billion kilowatthours last year. This corresponds to almost one third of the entire electricity generation in Europe. The special future requirements facing individual countries and power utilities not only ecologically, as a consequence of the Kyoto Protocol, but also economically, as a consequence of the deregulation of the European electricity market, make the intention of Germany to dispense with the use of nuclear power incomprehensible to the French point of view. Germany must pay special attention to fulfilling its international treaties and bilateral contracts, as Anne Lauvergeon, CEO of Cogema, explained in her presentation at the Bonn KTG conference. This applied in particular to the back end of the fuel cycle. In this respect, the head of Cogema argues that the waste and spent fuel management pathway must be chosen freely by the operator of a nuclear power plant. Within the safety requirements applying equally to all operators, the operator may freely decide under economic aspects whether he wants to recycle his spent fuel ol dispose of it as waste. Only when this freedom of choice is guaranteed and used will it be ensured that the economically and technically best solution will win the day in the competition of systems.

J	Kuhn, K; Hawickhorst, W				Kuhn, K; Hawickhorst, W			Waste management and final storage in Germany - Failed for lack of content and a technical basis?	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								The assertion by the political parries at present in government in Germany, SPD and Alliance 90/The Greens, that "the previous waste management concept for radioactive waste had failed in terms of content and no longer had any technical basis," is a purely ideological statement utterly devoid of any realistic reason. In actual fact, the waste management concept so far pursued in Germany has been transferred into industrial practice in many areas: Transports of radioactive waste and spent fuel elements can be carried out safely at any time; spent fuel has been rt processed on an industrial scale for many years. The central interim stores of Ahaus, Gorleben, and Lubmin, all of which are in operation, actually represent sufficient capacity for the interim storage of spent fuel elements. The successful exploration of the Gorleben salt dome has advanced far.. No result so far would detract from its suitability. Consequently, the federal govern ment should not try "to elaborate a (new) national waste management plan for the inherited burden of radioactive waste." but rather invest all its power to make functional as quickly as possible the missing building blocks in the existing waste management concept.

J	Sowa, W				Sowa, W			Worldwide survey of dry interim storage of fuel elements from power reactors	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								Spent fuel elements with approx. 10,500 t of heavy metal are discharged annually from power reactors worldwide. The total amount existing is approximately 220,000 t. The capacity increase of decay storage pools by compact storage is about to meet limits in technical terms and with respect to licensing. External interim storage of spent fuel elements: is bt coming more and Inore important. There is a certain tendency worldwide to use interim stores on the sites of nuclear power plants in order to overcome the need for transports on public traffic routes. In Germany, this trend is enforced by the lack of central stores accessible where and when the need arises. Most interim stores use dry interim storage. In Central and Western Europe, casks are employed almost exclusively: in the United States, more canisters than casks are used. More and more systems are employed which allow both storage and transports (dual purpose systems). In the future, multipurpose systems could well become the systems of choice which, in addition, allow direct disposal of the inventory in the packages used for transport and interim storage. In Germany, important preconditions have been created in the development of the POLLUX(R) cask. No safety-related problems are expected to arise fur either wet or dry interim storage. As a consequence, interim storage periods of Lip to 100 years seem to be possible without any technical problems especially for dry interim storage. Tentative plans along these lines are being developed in France and in the United States.

We have used this model to investigate the limitations of backlit shadowgraphy as a diagnostic of hydrogen ice surface quality inside the capsules. We impose known modal perturbations upon the simulated inner ice surface, and produce simulated shadowgraphs which are then analyzed as if they were real experimental data. We find that power spectra derived from backlit shadowgraphs appear to be reliable indicators of ice surface power spectra out to Fourier mode numbers as high as 80. We also suggest that some advantages may be obtained by using a collimated backlight, and possibly by utilizing backlit transmission interferometry. These results support the conclusion that backlit shadowgraphy is a valid quantitative diagnostic of lower-mode ice surface imperfections inside transparent spherical ICF shells.

Their internal walls are covered with a solid layer of frozen deuterium-tritium (D-T). One issue of inertial confinement fusion experiments is to guarantee the quality of the geometry of fuel layer. Cryogenic targets must be cooled at a temperature near the triple point (19K) with a very good stability (0.2mK) for many hours. This period is used to position the target with an accuracy of +/-5 mu m at the center of the experimental vacuum vessel where the 240 laser beams are focalized. A complex cryogenic infrastructure has been conceived to insure the continuity of the cryogenic chain from the filling station located at CEA/Valduc in Burgundy to the LMJ experimental chamber installed in the vicinity of Bordeaux. The design of the target and a detailed description of the infrastructure are presented. A first prototype of cryogenic grip has been fabricated and characterized. Some experimental results are given.

A computational fluid dynamics code was used to calculate the temperature profile in the target. The sensitivity of the temperature profiles was modeled for variations in (1) target alignment in the layering sphere, (2) target specifications, and (3) temperature uniformity on the layering sphere's inner surface. DT-ice non-uniformity in the target was determined by offsetting the center of the ice's void to a position that minimized the temperature variance of the ice surface. The numerical solutions were compared to analytical solutions when available.

This was carried out when nuclear technology was still being developed and knowledge of the effects of radiation exposure on humans was not well understood. As result of the discharge of liquid waste into the Techa River, there was large scale overexposure to both the workers at the facility and the population of riverside localities on the Techa River. There were also other environmental discharges, due to an accident and problems of waste storage, which contributed to exposure of other populations around MAYAK. Although all information on the MAYAK operation and its consequences for both workers and population was kept secret, studies on nuclear technology improvement, the handling of radioactive waste, of medical sequence of radiation exposure, radiation safety improvement, and prevention and treatment of radiation injuries were initiated virtually from the onset the of nuclear weapons production program.

J	Mokrov, Y; Glagolenko, Y; Napier, B				Mokrov, Y; Glagolenko, Y; Napier, B			Reconstruction of radionuclide contamination of the Techa River caused by liquid waste discharge from radiochemical production at the Mayak Production Association	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						contamination, environmental; accidents, nuclear; radiation, environmental; dose assessment		Because of its importance to reconstructing radiation doses for ongoing epidemiological studies, a feasibility study was undertaken to determine if the source term of radioactive materials released to the Techa River from the Mayak Production Association, the first facility in the former Soviet Union for the production of plutonium, could be reconstructed from historical measurements made at a limited number of downriver locations. The feasibility study used historically measured water flow rates and total-beta radioactivity measurements, and considered the processes of radioactive decay and of sorption/desorption. A simple radionuclide mass balance approach was used. To determine the rate of input of radionuclides to the Techa River system, the Techa River was depicted as a series of segments for which measurements are available. For each segment of the river, a system of recurrent (with time) equations was compiled for radioactivity balance accounting for the radioactivity inflow at the inflowing end, activity discharge with water at the outflowing end, and the reduction of activity because of radioactive decay. The equations change with time to account for the changing nature of the river regime. Effective sorption constants for Sr-90 and Cs-137, which characterize the transport of radionuclides among the river system components (water and bottom sediments), were defined based on the inventory of these radionuclides deposited at each of the studied river segments and data on water concentration and radioactive removal. All the information an radioactive contamination of the river system components during the period 1949-1996 was used. Solution of the series of equations provided information on the rate of input of these radionuclides into the upper end of the river. The pilot study indicated that it is possible to determine the historical releases of a wider suite of radionuclides using the historical monitoring data from numerous locations along the river, rather than relying on a more uncertain reconstruction of quantities released at the point of discharge. Radionuclides considered include Sr-90, Ru-106, (CS)-C-137, and Ce-144. Estimated concentrations of selected radionuclides at various times are presented.

Significant worker and population exposures occurred as a result of failures in the technological processes in the late 1940's and early 1950's. Residents of many villages downstream on the Techa River were exposed via a variety of pathways; the more significant included drinking of water from the river and external gamma exposure due to proximity to contaminated bottom sediment and shoreline. After the extent of the major contamination of the Techa River became known, several villages on the upper part of the Techa River were evacuated. Organ doses are being reconstructed on the basis of derivation of an historical source term and a simple river model used to simulate the transport of radionuclides downstream and their retention on sediments; measurements of Sr-90 content in teeth and the whole body of half of the members of the cohort; and development of the "Techa River Dosimetry System" for computation of the doses.

As a result, all components of the river system (water, bottom soils, and flood plains) were exposed to massive radioactive contamination. The protective measures taken in the 1950's resulted in the improvement of the radioecological conditions in the Techa River. After 1952, the radioecological conditions in the area were mostly determined by the long-lived radionuclides Sr-90 and Cs-137. This article focuses on the dependencies governing the migration of radionuclides along the vertical and horizontal planes in different components of the river system over a 40-y period. Until the 1990's, a decrease in Sr-90 and Cs-137 contents was noted in environmental samples and foodstuffs produced in riverside villages. In the subsequent years, the radioecological situation on the Techa stabilized. The sources of the current contamination of the river are represented by the runoffs from by-pass canals and swampy upper reaches.

High annual doses, approaching 1 Gy per year from external and internal radiation sources, were reported for a significant proportion of the workers in this cohort. The present data set includes 96 cases of chronic radiation sickness (CRS), 14 cases of acute radiation syndrome (ARS) and 13 cases of plutonium pneumosclerosis (PPn). The remainder of the sample consists of "uninjured workers" who had no known history of radiation illness or injury; however, the uninjured workers are not "controls" for radiation exposure. The data base is currently being expanded to 600 individuals sampled from the cohort of workers from 1948 to 1958 to allow a more complete analysis of the deterministic health effects and comparisons with existing health effect models. The final data base will be used with state-of-the-art modeling techniques to determine threshold doses and dose-response relationships for key clinical diagnostic variables.

During the early days of operation, technological failures resulted in the release of large amounts of radioactive waste into the Techa River. Residents who lived in villages on the banks of the Techa and Iset Rivers were exposed to varying levels of radioactivity, The objective of this study is to assess stochastic (carcinogenic) effects in populations exposed to offsite releases of radioactive materials from the Mayak nuclear facility in Russia. Subjects of the present study are those individuals who lived during the period January 1950 through December 1960 in any of the exposed villages along the Techa River in Chelyabinsk Oblast, Death certificates and cancer incidence data have been routinely collected in the past from a five-rayon catchment area of Chelyabinsk Oblast. The registry of exposed residents along the Techa River assembled and maintained by the Urals Research Center for Radiation Medicine for the past 40 y is the basis for identifying study subjects for this project. Specific study objectives are to evaluate the incidence of cancer among current and former residents of Chelyabinsk Oblast who are in the exposed Techa River cohort; integrate results from the dose-reconstruction study to estimate doses for risk assessment; and develop a structure for maintaining continued follow-up of the cohort for cancer incidence. In the earlier part of our collaborative effort, the focus has been to enhance the cancer morbidity registry by updating it with cancer cases diagnosed through 1997, to conduct a series of validation procedures to ensure completeness and accuracy of the registry, and to reduce the numbers of subjects lost to follow-up. A feasibility study to determine cancer morbidity in migrants from the catchment area has been proposed. Our preliminary analyses of cancer morbidity underscore the importance of examining both cancer mortality and cancer morbidity in conducting a comprehensive analysis of the occurrence of cancer in this important cohort.

The tissues are analyzed radiochemically and the analytical data are used to develop, modify, or refine biokinetic models that describe the depositions and translocations of plutonium and transplutonium elements in the human body. The purpose of this collaborative research project is to combine the unique information on humans, gathered by the two Registries, into a joint database and perform analyses of the data. A series of project tasks are directly concerned with dosimetry in Mayak workers and involve biokinetic modeling for actinide elements. Transportability coefficients derived from in-vitro solubility measurements of actinide-containing aerosols (as measured by the DRMIA) were related to specific workplaces within Mayak facilities. The transportability coefficients of inhaled aerosols significantly affected the translocation rates of plutonium from the respiratory tract to the systemic circulation. Parameters for a simplified lung model, used by Branch No. 1, Federal Research Center Institute of Biophysics (FIB-1) and the Mayak Production Association for dose assessment at long times after inhalation of plutonium-containing aerosols, were developed on the basis of joint USTUR and DRMIA data. This model has separate sets of deposition and transfer parameters for three aerosol transportability groups, allowing work histories of the workers to be considered in the dose-assessment process, FIB-1. biokinetic models were extended to include the distributions of actinide elements in systemic organs of workers, and a relationship between the health of individual workers and plutonium distribution in tissues was determined, Workers who suffered from liver diseases generally had a smaller fraction of systemic plutonium in the liver at death and a larger fraction in the skeleton than did relatively healthy workers. Also, the fraction of total systemic plutonium excreted per day was significantly greater for workers with liver diseases than for relatively healthy workers. These observations could have a considerable effect on organ dosimetry in health-impaired workers whose dose assessments were based solely on urinary excretion fates. A comparison of this model to other biokinetic models, such as those published by the International Commission for Radiological Protection, is currently underway as is the documentation of uncertainty estimates associated with the model.

Many workers had significant external and internal exposures, particularly during the early years (1948-1952) of operation. These dosimetric and worker history data are to be used in companion epidemiology studies of stochastic and deterministic effects. The database contains both external and internal dose information and is being constructed from other databases that include radiochemical analyses of tissues, bioassay data, air sampling data, whole body counting data, and occupational and worker histories. The procedures, models, methods, and operational uncertainties will be documented and included in the database, technical reports, and publications. The cohort of the stochastic epidemiological study is expected to include about 19,000 persons while the cohort for the deterministic epidemiological study is expected to include about 600 persons. For external dosimetry, workplace gamma, beta, and neutron doses are being reconstructed. The models used for this incorporate issues such as known isotopes, composition, shielding, further analysis of film badge sensitivities, and records of direct measurements. Organ doses from external exposures are also being calculated. Methods for calculating dose uncertainties are being developed. For internal dosimetry, the organ doses have been calculated using the established FIB-1 biokinetic model. A new biokinetic model is being developed that includes more information of the solubility and biokinetics of the different chemical forms and particulate sizes of plutonium that were in the workplace. In addition, updated worker histories will be used to estimate doses to some workers where direct measurements were not made, A rigorous quality control procedure is being implemented to ensure that the correct dosimetry data is entering the various databases being used by the epidemiologists.

Epidemiologic studies have observed markedly elevated risks of death from hepatic and hematologic cancers and extensive chromosomal damage among these patients. Few investigations have correlated multiple measures of genetic damage to determine whether these have independent induction kinetics. The distribution of chromosomal aberrations (CA) and mutant frequencies (MF) at the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) locus was evaluated in eight long-term thorotrast survivors (mean exposure time = 47.4 years) and five individuals who received a nonradioactive contrast medium during the same era. Materials and methods: Peripheral blood lymphocytes were harvested from whole blood, CA were scored in 500 complete metaphases and a clonal assay was used to determine hprt MF. Symmetrical aberrations were not evaluated. Differences in frequencies and correlations between endpoints were assessed using nonparametric methods. Results: Thorotrast-exposed individuals differed from the comparison group in total number of multicentrics and centric and acentric rings (per 500 cells [median, mean +/- sd]: 11, 18.3 +/- 23.1 vs 2, 2.4 +/- 1.1, p=0.04). There was no difference between the groups on hprt MF (12.6, 15.9 +/- 13.5 vs 16.6, 14.0 +/- 8.8[ x 10(-6)]; p = 1.0). Among the exposed, hprt MF was moderately correlated with the frequency of asymmetrical chromosomal aberrations, although the association was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Noting the limitations of small samples, long-term thorotrast survivors were observed to be at an increased risk for genetic damage.

J	El-Genk, MS; Tournier, JM				El-Genk, MS; Tournier, JM			Estimates of helium gas release in (PuO2)-Pu-238 fuel particles for radioisotope heat sources and heater units	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							FISSION-PRODUCT RELEASE; 1600-DEGREES-C; IRRADIATION	Release data of noble gases (Xe and Kr) from small-grain (7-40 mu m), large-grain ( greater than or equal to 300 mu m), and monocrystal UO2 fuel particles, during isothermal irradiation up to 6.4 at.% and 2030 K are reviewed and their applicability to estimate helium release from (PuO2)-Pu-238 fuel particles(greater than or equal to 300 mu m in diameter) is examined. Coated (PuO2)-Pu-238 particles have recently been proposed for use in radioisotope power systems and heater units employed in planetary exploration missions. These fuel particles are intentionally sized and designed to prevent any adverse radiological effect and retain the helium gas generated by the radioactive decay of (238)pu, a desired feature for some planetary missions. Results suggest that helium release from large-grain ( greater than or equal to 300 mu m) particles of K could be <7% at 1723 K, <0.6% at 1042 K, and even less for polycrystalline particles fabricated using sol-gel processes. Results also suggest that helium release from small-grain plutonia particles at 1723 K could be >80% but less than 7% at 1042 K, which is in general agreement with the experiments conducted at Los Alamos National Laboratory more than two decades ago. In these experiments, the helium gas release from small-grain (7-40 mu m) (PuO2)-Pu-238 fuel pellets has been measured during steady-state heating at temperatures up to 1886 K and ramp heating to 1723 K.

J	Balden, M; Roth, J				Balden, M; Roth, J			New weight-loss measurements of the chemical erosion yields of carbon materials under hydrogen ion bombardment	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							SURFACE LOSS PROBABILITIES; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; GRAPHITE; IMPACT; RADICALS	Total erosion yields of graphite and carbon materials under hydrogen and deuterium bombardment measured with the weight-loss method are presented for ion energies between 15 eV and 8 keV in the temperature range 300 to above 1000 K. The temperature of the maximum of the chemical erosion increases from below 600 to above 850 K with ion energies from 15 to 300 eV. Chemical erosion yields obtained by weight-loss measurements exceed yields measured mass-spectrometrically always by a factor of about two. Collector experiments show that a fraction of the eroded particle sticks to walls and, therefore, reduces the yield measured by mass spectrometry. A synergistic effect of neutrals in the ion beam on the chemical erosion yield can be excluded. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
