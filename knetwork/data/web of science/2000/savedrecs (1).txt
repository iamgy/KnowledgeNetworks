The thickness of the films was about 2-3 mum. The film is compact, oxidation-resistant, and has good adherence with the substrate below 500 degreesC. Tritium gas permeation of 316L with multiple films was examined, and it was found that the tritium permeability in 316L with a TiN + TIC + TiN film was 4-5 orders of magnitude lower, and in 316L with a TiN + TiC + SiO2 film was 4-6 orders of magnitude lower than that in 316L with a Pd film at about 200-500 degreesC. At about 600 degreesC, the permeability of 316L with the multiple coating was 3-4 orders of magnitude lower than that in 316L with a Pd film. The result shows that the tritium permeation barrier is formed by multiple coating above 300 degreesC, and it is stable below 500 degreesC. However, the barrier is partly destroyed at about 600 degreesC because of oxidation; although this results in degradation of the barrier, it still plays a positive role. These films may be useful as coatings for the first wall, tritium blanket, and heat exchanger in fusion reactors for tritium permeation resistance. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper presents the results of different experiments with various deuterium to humidity ratios (p(H2O)/p(D2) from 300 vppm to 30%). All experiments show that Incoloy 800 readily oxidizes and that permeation reduction factors (PRF) of at least 100 are easily obtained for typical blanket conditions. The measured PRF values are explained in terms of the type and thickness of the oxides on the Incoloy surface. The observed reduction in permeation is very favorable for the design of the HCPB blanket system in order to reduce the amount of hydrogen needed for isotope swamping and hence, reducing the size of the tritium extraction system.

However, a thinner film has quite the opposite effect: a dramatic increase of permeation and retention, and a corresponding suppression of re-emission. In view of the benefits expected from particle control with a superpermeable membrane placed right inside the divertor, the behavior of a Mb sample was investigated in a plasma-membrane device having a graphite target. Even polyatomic carbide coating was found not to hinder hydrogen absorption and permeation. Polyatomic non-carbide C films effectively inhibits it, but the formation of such films depends on H and C fluxes, H energy and metal temperature. A durable isolation of suprathermal hydrogen with the superpermeable membrane was observed at a high enough ratio between H and C fluxes, and the effects of carbon were found to have a non-monotonic temperature dependence.

Alumina seems to be a promising coating material. However, an appropriate coating system must also have the potential for self-healing since the ceramic alumina scale tends to fail if mechanical stress is applied. A technology is introduced here to form a ductile Al enriched surface scale on Manet II steel (Fe-10.3%Cr) with an alumina overlayer. This technology consists of two main process steps. Hot dip aluminising has been performed at 700 degreesC for 30 s in order to introduce Al to the near surface zone. The very hard intermetallic scale Fe2Al5 which forms during the immersion process gets completely transformed into FeAl2, FeAl and alpha -Fe(Al) phases during a subsequent hot isostatic press (HIP) process step at high pressure at 1040 degreesC for 30 min. The pressures chosen for the HIPing were 1000 and 2000 bar. Without HIPing pores form due to the Kirkendall effect. The influence of the high pressure on the heat treatment (1040 degreesC, 30 min) will be discussed in this paper. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Issues such as tritium release from candidate ceramic breeder pebbles for the HCPB blanket and tritium permeation through cooling tubes of the WCLL blanket are investigated simultaneously. In EXOTIC-8.9, the tritium release behaviour of a Li2TiO3 pebble bed is measured along with the tritium-permeation rate through a double-wall tube (DWT) of T91 with a Cu interlayer. In EXOTIC-8.10, the tritium release behaviour of a Li4SiO4 pebble bed is measured along with the tritium permeation rate through a T91 tube with a Fe-Al/Al2O3 coating as tritium permeation barrier (TPB). Tritium permeation phenomena are studied by variations of temperatures and purge gas conditions. This paper reports on the results of the first 100 irradiation days. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The pebbles are fabricated using the extrusion-spheronization-sintering process and are optimized regarding composition, geometrical characteristics, microstructural characteristics, and material purity. Tests were designed and are being performed with other organizations so as to check the functional performance of the pebbles and pebble beds with respect to the HCPB blanket requirements, and, finally, to make the selection of the most appropriate ceramic for the HCPB blanket. Tests include high temperature long-term annealing, thermal shock, thermal cycling, thermal mechanical behaviour of pebble beds, thermal conductivity of pebble beds, and tritium extraction. Current results indicate the attractiveness of these ceramics pebbles for the HCPB blanket. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The CPD change for Li2O was generally insensitive to the oxygen partial pressure in the sweep gas. A similar insensitivity was also observed for LiAlO2. Although the CPD change of Li2O was about 200 mV when the oxygen partial pressure was changed by as much as 15 orders of magnitude, such was not the case for LiAlO2. By comparing with the results obtained for other Li-bearing ceramics, it was estimated to be caused by the adsorption/desorption processes of water vapor contained in the sweep gas.

J	Gohar, Y; Smith, DL				Gohar, Y; Smith, DL			Multiplier, moderator, and reflector materials for advanced lithium-vanadium fusion blankets	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Fusion Reactor Materials (ICFRM-9)	OCT 10-15, 1999	COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO	US DOE, Off Fus Energy Sci, Argoone Natl Lab, Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Pacific NW Natl Lab, Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Amer Nucl Soc, Min Met & Mat Soc				The self-cooled lithium-vanadium fusion blanket concept has several attractive operational and environmental features. In this concept, liquid lithium works as the tritium breeder and coolant to alleviate issues of coolant breeder compatibility and reactivity. Vanadium alloy (V-4Cr-Ti) is used as the structural material because of its superior performance relative to other alloys for this application. However, this concept has poor attenuation characteristics and energy multiplication for the DT neutrons. An advanced self-cooled lithium-vanadium fusion blanket concept has been developed to eliminate these drawbacks while maintaining all the attractive features of the conventional concept. An electrical insulator coating for the coolant channels, spectral shifter (multiplier, and moderator) and reflector were utilized in the blanket design to enhance the blanket performance. In addition, the blanket was designed to have the capability to operate at average loading conditions of 2 MW/m(2) surface heat flux and 10 MW/m(2)? neutron wall loading. This paper assesses the spectral shifter and the reflector materials and it defines the technological requirements of this advanced blanket concept. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

This paper presents an evaluation of the advantages and drawbacks caused by the substitution of the currently employed alloy lead-lithium (Pb-17Li) by a suitable tin-lithium alloy: (i) for the European water-cooled Pb-17Li (WCLL) blanket concept with reduced activation ferritic-martensitic steel as the structural material; (ii) for the European self-cooled TAURO blanket with SiCf/SiC as the structural material. It was found that in none of these blankets Sn-Li alloys would lead to significant advantages, in particular due to the low tritium breeding capability. Only in forced convection cooled diverters with W-alloy structure, Sn-Li alloys would be slightly more favorable. It is concluded that Sn-Li alloys are only advantageous in free surface cooled reactor internals, as this would make maximum use of the principal advantage of Sn-Li, i.e., the low vapor pressure.

On the other hand, as the fabrication method of Li2TiO3 pebbles, the wet process is the most advantageous from the viewpoint of mass production, etc. In this study, fabrication of small Li2TiO3 pebbles less than empty set 0.5 mm was performed by the wet process with substitution reaction, and the characteristics of Li2TiO3 pebbles fabricated by this process were evaluated. From the results of the fabrication tests, excellent prospects were obtained concerning mass production of Li2TiO3 pebbles with the target density (80-85% T.D.) and target diameter (less than empty set 0.5 mm).

We have tested several different product forms of Be with different densities and levels of porosity. Oxidation kinetics has been determined by measurements of hydrogen release with a mass spectrometer, volumetric measurements of the product gas and weight change of the sample. We discuss and compare with the literature the fundamental mechanisms and kinetics controlling the oxidation of Be in steam. Fully dense beryllium exhibits parabolic, linear and accelerating modes of oxidation as temperature increases from 450 degreesC to 1200 degreesC. The oxidation mechanisms and temperature trends are similar for other product forms. Oxidation rates are higher, however, when processing or annealing significantly increases the extent of interconnected porosity and consequently the effective surface area. The effective surface area as measured by BET surface analyses is a key parameter when comparing oxidation rates. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Post-irradiation examinations (PIEs) of the Li4SiO4 have been performed at the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (FZK) to investigate the tritium release kinetics, the effects of Li-burnup, of the contact with beryllium during irradiation and the changes in the mechanical stability of the pebbles due to irradiation. Based on these data one can conclude that neither the contact with beryllium nor a burnup up to 13% have a detrimental effect on the tritium release of Li4SiO4 pebbles, but at 18% Li-burnup the residence time is increased by about a factor of 3. The mechanical strength of both irradiated and unirradiated pebbles has been examined by means of crush tests. According to the PIE no significant changes in the mechanical stability of the pebbles have been observed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

From these results, it was clear that the apparent diffusion coefficient at 600 degreesC was significantly affected by irradiation conditions, but returned to normal values at 900 degreesC, apparently due to thermal annealing.

The main requirements for the porous beryllium multiplier for the breeding blanket are: (1) inherently open porosity within 20+/-2% for easy removal of radioactive gases; (2) high thermal conductivity; (3) close contact with a stainless steel (SS) shell to provide high heat transfer. A beryllium multiplier can be fabricated by two different techniques: by manufacturing porous or pebble bed beryllium. The method designed (patent 2106931 RU) in SSC RF-VNIINM (Russia) provides for the production of porous beryllium conforming to the requirements mentioned above. For comparative fission tests and the optimization of breeding zone functional capabilities, porous (21.9%) and binary pebble bed (density = 78%) beryllium multipliers were fabricated. DEMO breeding blanket models and a mock-up of fission (IVV-2M reactor) tests have been manufactured at SSC RF-VNIINM. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The dynamic adsorption and desorption model for tritium desorption from lithium ceramics, especially Li2O was constructed. From the experimental results, it was considered that both H-2 and H2O are dissociatively adsorbed on Li2O and generate OH- on the surface. In the first model developed in 1994, it was assumed that either the dissociative adsorption of H-2 or H2O on Li2O generates two OH- on the surface. However, recent calculation results show that the generation of one OH- and one H- is more stable than that of two OH- s by the dissociative adsorption of H-2 Therefore, assumption of H-2 adsorption and desorption in the first model is improved and the tritium release behavior from Li2O surface is evaluated again by using the improved model.

It is shown that :he tritium release rate depends on porosity at densities above 87% T.D., while no dependence was observed at densities below 86% T.D. The tritium release process is thought to consist of three stages described as follows: (1) the liberation of tritium trapped at point defects due to their recovery (peak at around 570 K); (2) the advection through interconnected pores via adsorption and desorption on their inner walls and diffusion in the gas phase of interconnected pores (peak set around 620 K); (3) the dissolution and release of tritium trapped in closed pores (peaks at around 700, 830 and 1000 K).

Synthesis of lithium orthosilicate, metasilicate and aluminate, fabrication of ceramic pellets and pebbles and experimental reactor units are described. Results of tritium extraction kinetics under irradiation in a water-graphite reactor at a thermal neutron flux of 5 x 10(13) neutron/(scm(2)) are considered. At the present time, development and fabrication of lithium orthosilicate-beryllium modules of the tritium-breeding zone (TBZ), have been carried out within the framework of the ITER and DEMO projects. Two modules containing orthosilicate pellets, porous beryllium and beryllium pebbles are suggested for irradiation tests in the temperature range of 350-700 degreesC. Technical problems associated with manufacturing of the modules are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

However, when the lithium-containing materials are irradiated by 14 MeV neutrons, radioactive Be-7 is produced by sequential charged particle reactions (SCPR). In this study, we measured effective Be-7 production cross-sections in several lithium-containing samples at 14 MeV: the cross-sections are in the order of mub. Estimation of the effective cross-sections is attempted, and the estimated values agreed well with the experimental data. It was shown that the Be-7 activity in a unit volume of lithium-containing materials in D-T fusion reactors can exceed total activity of the same unit volume of the SiC structural material in a certain cooling time. Consequently, a careful consideration of the Be-7 production by SCPR is required to assess radioactive inventories in lithium-containing D-T fusion blanket materials. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Refractory metal-base alloys react readily with oxygen and other gases, and molybdenum alloys are susceptible to losses from highly volatile molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) species. Transport of radioactivity by the volatilization, migration and re-depssition of MoO3 during a potential accident involving a loss of vacuum or inert environment represents a safety issue. We have experimentally measured the oxidation, volatilization and re-deposition of molybdenum from TZM in flowing air between 400 degreesC and 800 degreesC. Calculations using chemical thermodynamic data for vapor pressures over pure MoO3 and a vaporization mass transfer model correlate well with the experimental data between 600 degreesC and 800 degreesC. Partial saturation of(MoO3) gas species accounts for influences of flow rate at 700 degreesC. Some anomalies in oxidation rate below 650 degreesC suggest that other phases, e.g., MoO2 or other non-stoichiometric oxides may influence oxidation and volatilization processes under some limited conditions.

In-vessel structural materials consist of V-alloys or low activation martensitic (LAM) steel; tritium-producing materials are Li(2)O, Pb-17Li, Li(4)SiO(4) With a Be-multiplier; coolants are helium or water. The strategy chosen reduces permanent radwaste by recycling the in-vessel materials and by clearance of the other structures. Limits of the contact dose rate and specific activity of the waste allowing such options are defined accordingly. SEAFP activities for 1999 enlarge the analysis to three additional reactors with in-vessel structures made with SiC/SiC composites. These materials cannot be recycled due to their form and, according to national regulations of E.C. countries, long-lived activation products hinder near-surface burial (NSB).

The measurements were performed over the temperature range 523-723 K with deuterium driving pressures ranging from 5 x 10(2) to 5 x 10(5) Pa. The deuterium surface rate constants obtained are: sigmaK(1) (mol m(-2) s(-1) Pa-=1) = 2.998 x 10(-8) exp(-29230/RT), sigmaK(2) (mol(-1) m(4) s(-1)) = 2.838 x 10(-7) exp(-28679/RT), R in J/K mol(-1). An intermediate gas transport regime has been accounted for over the experimental range. The transport regime was found close to the surface-limited regime as the deuterium driving pressure is lowered and the temperature increased. Permeability Phi has been derived together with surface rate constants: Phi (mol m(-1) Pa-1/2 s(-1))= 5.311 x 10(-8) exp(-44988/RT). This is in very good agreement with the permeability previously measured using a different gas evolution method, evidencing the consistency of the obtained results. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Verwerft, M				Verwerft, M			Multiple voltage electron probe microanalysis of fission gas bubbles in irradiated nuclear fuel	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							IMPROVED ABSORPTION CORRECTION; UO2; RELEASE; TRANSIENTS; BURNUP; XENON	The accurate analysis of locally retained fission gas in nuclear fuel is inherently difficult since the physical form under which it is stored varies from an atomic dispersion to bubbles with a diameter of several hundreds of nanometers. One of the techniques that has been applied since more than 20 yr is electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). This technique, however, is difficult to apply in a quantitative manner if the studied materials are inhomogeneous at the scale of the electron-solid interaction volume. In this paper, a method is developed to analyse a system of gas bubbles distributed in a solid matrix. It is based on the geometric modelling of a gas bubble dispersion and the assessment of its influence on the emitted X-ray intensity. The calculation exploits experimental results acquired at different accelerating voltages. The resulting more accurate analysis of gas retained in nuclear fuel may lead to a better insight in the gas release mechanisms. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Alimov, VK; Ertl, K; Roth, J; Schmid, K				Alimov, VK; Ertl, K; Roth, J; Schmid, K			Retention of ion-implanted deuterium in tungsten pre-irradiated with carbon ions	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							GRAPHITE; RELEASE	Deuterium (D) ion implantation and retention at room temperature was studied in pure and carbon (C) implanted tungsten single crystals. Pre-implantation with C was done at 40 keV and D implantation at 10 keV with the range confined in the carbon modified layer and at 100 keV with the range exceeding the carbon modified layer. The range distributions were investigated in situ using 1 MeV He-3 ions analysing the energy distributions of alpha particles from the D(He-3, p)alpha reaction while the total amount of retained D was obtained from the p-integral. The range distribution of carbon was obtained from the backscattered He-3 energy distribution. C pre-impantation influences the D retention only if the range of the D ions is confined within the carbon modified surface layer. In this case, D diffusion beyond the ion range distribution does not occur and the retained D amount is smaller than in the pure W crystal. At D energies exceeding the carbon modified layer the retention occurs in the dislocation zone up to 1 mum and the total retained amount is the same for carbon implanted and pure W samples.

Whatever the electrolysis conditions, the deposit morphology was dendritic. The influence of the parameters current density, melt temperature and electrolyte concentration on the morphology was investigated using an optimal design. Our results show that increasing the temperature makes the coatings more compact. The dendritic morphology is attributed to transport phenomena (diffusion, convection, migration) promoted by the cation discharge at the substrate-coating interface. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Volkovich, VA; Griffiths, TR; Fray, DJ; Thied, RC				Volkovich, VA; Griffiths, TR; Fray, DJ; Thied, RC			A new method for determining oxygen solubility in molten carbonates and carbonate-chloride mixtures using the oxidation of UO2 to uranate reaction	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							ELECTRODE REACTION; AU-ELECTRODES; QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS; REDUCTION; KINETICS; MELTS; LI2CO3-K2CO3; CURVES; POWDER	One of the possible pyrochemical reprocessing procedures for spent ceramic nuclear fuels may involve the oxidation of UO2 in alkali metal carbonate and carbonate-based melts, and this is controlled by the level of dissolved oxygen in the melt. A quantitative relationship has been derived between the extent of UO2 oxidation and the concentration of oxygen (peroxide/superoxide) species formed upon oxygen dissolution in carbonates. A novel sensitive method for determining oxygen solubility in molten carbonates and carbonate-based melts has thus been developed. The concentrations of the alkali metal uranates(VI) formed can then be accurately determined without interference from unreacted UO2. Oxygen solubilities at temperatures from 450 degreesC to 800 degreesC have been determined. The solubility of oxygen in a range of carbonate-chloride melts was also determined and found to increase with decreasing radius of the cation of the alkali metal chloride added. Measurements at various partial pressures of oxygen allowed the determination of the predominant oxygen species formed in the melt, and preliminary experiments showed that in the ternary carbonate melt, at 450 degreesC, oxygen dissolves forming mainly superoxide ions.

A normal evolution scenario has been considered with a possible release of the radionuclides after 1000 years (container failure) and their transport from the disposal to some outlets of the geosphere over periods of time as long as 10(6) years. The solubility of crystallized ThO2, synthesized by calcination of thorium oxalate up to 1600 degreesC, has been measured under various conditions of temperature and water composition; an upper limit value of 10(-8) mol l(-1) has been chosen for the calculations. As for a direct disposal of U-based fuels, the radiological impact of a Th-based fuel is essentially due to the labil fraction (2 +/- 1% of the total inventory) of the fission products, I-129 and Cs-135. Th, contribution of the transuranium elements, Pa-231, Th-229 and Ra-226, mainly bounded to the ThO2 matrix, increases over time, but remains lower up to 6 x 10(5) years.

J	Inoue, M				Inoue, M			Thermal conductivity of uranium-plutonium oxide fuel for fast reactors	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							UO2	A new thermal conductivity correlation for fully dense uranium-plutonium oxide fuel for fast reactors was formulated for fuel pin thermal analysis under beginning of irradiation conditions. The data set used in correlating the equation was systematically selected to minimize experimental uncertainty. The electron conduction term for uranium dioxide formulated by Harding and Martin [J. Nucl. Mater. 166 (1989) 223] was adopted to compensate for so few high temperature measurements. The excellent predictability of the new correlation was validated by comparing the calculated with measured fuel center temperatures in an instrumented irradiation test in the experimental fast reactor JOYO for low oxygen-to-metal (O/M) ratio fuel up to 1850 K.

It considers the specific radial variations of the neutron reactions of all the fissionable nuclides as functions of burnup and U-235 enrichment in the pellet. Comparison of the RAPID prediction with the measured data of the irradiated fuels and the predicted results by other codes showed good agreement, and therefore, the RAPID model can be used for UO2 fuel of up to 10 w/o U-235 enrichment and 150 MWD/(kg U) pellet average burnup under the LWR environment.

The model bundles contained nine PWR type fuel rods. Their cladding was pre-oxidised by argon-oxygen (test 1) and steam (test 2). The released aerosol was measured continuously by laser particle counters. Morphology and elemental composition of the aerosol particles were studied on samples collected by impactors and quartz filters. The highest aerosol release was detected at the steepest rise of the bundle temperature. A second increase of the aerosol release appeared at the cooling down period. Because of the higher maximum temperature at test 2 about two orders of magnitude more uranium was released than in test 1. The highest emission was found for tin at test 1 and for zirconium and iron at test 2. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The chemical sputtering yield was obtained from measurements of the released methane signal with a quadrupole mass analyser. It was found that the methane yield at peak temperatures is almost independent of flux from 5 x 10(20) to 4 x 10(21) m(-2) s(-1). Peak temperatures range between 900 and 1000 K, which is higher than those of the previous low flux experiments (<900 K, < 10(20) m(-2) s(-1)). By comparing our experimental results with calculation results based on Roth's model, the annealing effect of radiation damage to prevent methyl group formation appears to be unimportant.

A part of Mg atoms (fraction m) were assumed to occupy the interstitial 4b sites of the solid solution, and the number of ways of arranging the free ions and intra-cation complexes was calculated followed by differentiation of the logarithm of this number with respect to oxygen non-stoichiometry to obtain partial molar entropy of oxygen. As the complexes, (A(2+)U(5+)), (A(2+)2U(5+)) and (B3+U5+) were assumed to be formed. For the first two complexes, an average composition (A(2+)alphaU(5+)) was defined, and for (B3+U5+) a fraction, beta, of B3+ was considered to form the complex. The O/M ratio (M = A + B + U) which gave the steepest change of Delta(G) over barO(2) was calculated. Below this O/M ratio to 2 - y - (1 - beta )z/2, the solid solution possibly satisfied the relation m = X/(2y), where X = -x. In the region where this relation held, the solid solution was supposed to be oxygen stoichiometric. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Coating was accomplished from the reaction of boron trichloride with hydrogen at 1250 K in a tube furnace, and then sintering at 1400 and 1525 K. The deposited boron was identified by infrared spectrum. The morphology of the coating was studied by using scanning electron microscope. The plate, grainy and string (fiber)-like boron structures were observed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kolman, DG; Griego, ME; James, CA; Butt, DP				Kolman, DG; Griego, ME; James, CA; Butt, DP			Thermally induced gallium removal from plutonium dioxide for MOX fuel production	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							BEHAVIOR; OXIDE	A dry process for separating Ga2O3 from PuO2 - 1 wt% Ga2O3 powder was developed. PuO2-Ga2O3 powder was exposed to flowing Ar-6% H-2 at 600-1200 degreesC. Under these conditions, Ga2O3 is reduced to Ga2O, a volatile species. Ga2O, which is stable in a reducing environment at temperatures greater than 800 degreesC, evolves and is collected downstream. Different process parameters were varied in an effort to optimize thermally induced gallium removal (TIGR). Exposure temperature had the greatest effect on TIGR. Temperatures of at least 1000 degreesC were required to obtain discernible TIGR. As little as 25 wppm Ga remained after processing PuO2 at 1200 degreesC. It is likely that a further reduction in retained Ga can be attained by increasing the processing temperature. Ga removal was shown to increase with process time. However, the benefit in processing beyond 4 h is limited for this system. The lack of effect of sample volume and gas flow rate on TIGR suggests that Ga removal is limited by mass transport within the powder particles. The fact that Ga removal is less efficient in more coarse PuO2 powders supports this hypothesis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In the method, peak efficiency curves must be obtained for each kind of sample in advance. For the reason, usually, many standard volume sources have been made which have different shapes, densities, matrix compositions and so on. This paper describes about a simple method for determination of gamma -ray efficiency curves by the combination of Monte Carlo simulations and a single-point calibration using a standard point source. This method enables us to determine the efficiency curves for various types of samples and detectors easily and precisely.

The system consists of a radiation-resistive optical fiberscope, light source and a radiation-resistive video camera. The severe radiation environment in TRACY and safety functions as the primary boundary of TRACY were considered in the design of the system. The system has been successfully utilized in the recent TRACY experiments, and provided clear color motion pictures showing the behavior of the solution and radiolytic gas voids. As a result, it was visually confirmed that there is the difference in the behavior of the solution and radiolytic gas voids depending on the conditions of the reactivity addition. The system provides detailed information on the behavior of the solution and voids, and will contribute to the development of a computational kinetics model.

The potential transport and fate of these radioactive species are dependent upon their speciation and the geochemical behavior of the predominant ones. The speciation of different valence states of neptunium [Np(IV, V and VI)] and their migration behavior are investigated. The data revealed that the uptake is highly dependent upon pH and the distribution coefficient (K-d) is depressed by the presence of organic ligands. The relative migration velocities (V-n) of the valence states relative to that of groundwater, in the concerned area, clarified that Np(V) is the most mobile species and their transport rates are highly accelerated by the presence of humic acid. Also, a radionuclide dispersion model was applied to elucidate the migration behavior of these radioactive species in the selected site and to quantitatively predict their concentrations at different distances in both x and z directions over long time scales.

Using animal skin models of 5-day-old rat and 9-day-old rat, either intact or stripped, it was found that besides the transepidermal also the transfolicular flux can be important. Stratum corneum was found to be the principal permeation barrier in all cases.

Pb-210 analysis was performed by extraction chromatography with measuring the ingrowing daughter Bi-210 radioactivity by liquid-scintillation spectrometry. It was found that concentration variations of Se, As, Sb, Zr and Zn are probably controlled by the intensity and composition of the material supplied from the drainage basin constituted by volcanic and sedimentary rocks.

The influence of common anions and cations on the sorption of each metal was examined. The sorption data subjected to different sorption isotherms have shown that the sorption of all the radionuclides followed Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) isotherms. The sorption capacity intensity and energy were evaluated for each element studied. The variation of sorption with temperature was monitored for all radionuclides except zinc and selenium. The values of DeltaH, DeltaS and DeltaG were estimated and found to be negative indicating exothermic and spontaneous nature of sorption. It was found that PUF is an effective and economical sorbent for traces of metal ions which can be used for the separation/preconcentration of these ions from their very dilute solutions and has useful applications in radioanalytical and environmental chemistry and in radioactive and industrial liquid waste management.

The extraction constants of both the acids are shown to be close to one another which results in their mutual displacement from the organic phase. Contrary to uranium, the extraction of thorium is much reduced as the concentration of hydrofluoric acid increases which may be explained by a stronger complexation of Th by fluoride ion in the aqueous phase.

Hexahydrate of thorium nitrate as well as hexa- and trihydrate of uranyl nitrate were supposed to be formed in this system. Empiric equations of solubility isotherms were derived for 25 degreesC and liquid phase densities were determined. It was established that nitric acid was salted out into the vapour phase by the nitrates present in the system both separately and simultaneously.

A long-term durability of both evaporators was demonstrated by results of operation data, evaporation performance, and corrosion resistance. With regards to corrosion resistance, cracks and local corrosion such as pitting and intergranular attack were not observed on both evaporators after the test, and a corrosion of weld was not selective. The average corrosion rates at measuring points were less than 0.1 mm/yr respectively, however, thickness of the Ti-5%Ta alloy evaporator was slightly reduced in vapor phase region. In addition, the destructive inspection showed that the mechanical properties of both materials were not degraded during the test. From an engineering perspective, an excellent durability of Ti-5%Ta alloy and Zr evaporators under high oxidative environment was successfully demonstrated through this mock-up test.

On average, about one-sixth of the total fuel inventory must be renewed each year. A variety of refuelling modes are employed at particular stations arising from detailed design, historical and safety case considerations. At Hartlepool and Heysham 1, which are of the same design, routine refuelling is done in batches with the reactors off-load and depressurized (although pressurized off-load refueling is also permitted). The batches are as large practicable in order to minimize output losses due to refuelling. The batch process involves both (a) the exchange of spent fuel assemblies for new ones (b) the transfer of part-burnt fuel assemblies to new positions in the core to improve fuel utilization - known as 'radial shuffling'. Once the batch is complete, a programme of irradiated fuel disposals (separating the fuel assemblies into individual fuel elements and culminating in the dispatch of fuel elements off site in flasks) and new fuel assembly builds is begun. These operations involve the use of several fuel route plant facilities including cooling ponds. The refuelling process from the build of new fuel to the final handling of complete irradiated fuel assemblies is covered by a refuelling safety case. Further safety cases exist for the handling of individual irradiated elements both on and off site. All these cases are updated as necessary via a formal plant modifications procedure and they have recently been subject to a ten-yearly periodic safety review (PSR). Arising from the PSR, work to consolidate the cases is in progress including studies in the seismic and human factors areas. Development work to improve the efficiency of the fuel route is also under way. This involves (a) process improvements to assist operators (b) engineered improvements to improve speed and reliability (c) fuel utilization improvements by increases in discharge irradiation and radial shuffling. A vision of fuel route operation is presented which minimizes the required plant availability and hence increases the flexibility of operation. In order to achieve this vision an increase in reliability of the fuel route equipment will be needed and an increased utilization of the available storage capacity in the cooling ponds.

A recent survey could clarify the status of the graphite with respect to stored energy. Based on the history of pile 1, it is not possible to present a unique set of release curves valid for all investigated channels. Furthermore, as they are inaccessible for drilling, it has not been possible to survey the surrounding blocks and thus their status with regard to stored energy is unknown. Graphite samples of several blocks show release behaviour that exceeds the heat capacity of unirradiated graphite. Statistically, however, this affects less than 25% of the material. Consequently, 75% of the material does not represent any risk in the sense that either handling or later encapsulation of the graphite will result in unforeseeable energy release. In order to plan all stages of the graphite disposal process, it is necessary to consider whether an inadvertent release of stored energy could occur during handling and storage and whether deliberate or partial annealing of the material is required. On the basis of a multi-activation energy concept, it can be shown that annealing between 200 and 250 degreesC can clear all sites which will eventually be activated by the grouting process. This temperature range was examined with respect to the efficiency of a deliberate annealing procedure. A total of 80-90% of the stored energy releasable up to 500 degreesC can be released if the annealing procedure is executed between 250 and 300 degreesC. With regard to tritium release from graphite during annealing, ground pile 1 graphite material was heated and the desorption of tritium was measured. It appears that less than 0.5% of the total tritium content is released at the proposed annealing temperatures.

J	Broeders, CHM; Broeders, I				Broeders, CHM; Broeders, I			Neutron physics analyses of accelerator-driven subcritical assemblies	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								In order to improve the safety characteristics of nuclear systems, accelerator driven assemblies have been proposed for energy production and for the incineration of the residuals of the back-end of the nuclear fuel cycle like plutonium, minor actinides and long-lived fission products. For the neutron physics analysis of such source driven systems calculation procedures have been established and qualified at FZK. Necessary extensions to the conventional methods for fission reactors are discussed in some detail, especially for the spallation processes initiated by protons with energies of about 1 GeV. The application of these methods in an IAEA benchmark for an energy amplifier type of ADS identified the problem of the unfavorable power distribution in such sub-critical systems. In order to improve the power distributions the application of multiple sources, radial distributed over the reactor assembly has been proposed. Investigations for an ADS with three proton beams are performed with respect to the capability of incineration of plutonium and minor actinides. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
