L. HEATH has been recreated and enhanced as an electronic file and is available on CD-ROM or over the Internet. This electronic version includes 1998 gamma-ray data from the Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data File database as downloaded in 1998 as well as decay scheme drawings. Future developments of similar catalogues will include gamma-ray spectra from radioactive decay with newer detectors and spectra from neutron interactions with elemental samples and separated isotopes. The electronic form of these catalogues will allow the creation of tutorials on gamma-ray spectrometry and on the data included.

J	Martin, JE; Lee, C				Martin, JE; Lee, C			The legacy and future of radioactive waste management at the Millennium	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								Wastes containing radioactive materials have been produced ever since ore recovery and processing began; however, such materials did not become of public concern until the large-scale activities involving uranium and thorium ores and nuclear fission during and after World War II. Efforts to provide disposal sites for radioactive wastes, especially those associated with nuclear weapons and nuclear energy, have been largely unsuccessful for the past 40 years or so and are nearing crisis proportions as the new millennium begins - its eventual resolution is believed to require greater reliance on stewardship and a larger governmental presence.

It is used in nuclear spectroscopy as well as to study chemical properties of the heaviest elements. Here three of the most successful techniques will be presented. Two of them are automatized batch techniques and the third one is fully continuous. Possible future developments will be discussed, especially with respect to continuous solvent extraction.

The present study is concerned with the heat removal experiment of vault storage system adopting cross flow with passive cooling, using a 1/5 scale model. The results show that the flow pattern of air in the storage module strongly depends on the ratio of the buoyancy to the inertia force. A simple method to estimate air flow patterns in the storage module was proposed, where the Ri (Richardson) number was considered as the most representative parameter. Then the heat transfer rate from a storage tube to cooling air was estimated, which could apply to the design of a full-scale vault storage system with cross flow, in which dozens of storage tubes were placed. The acquired information was also used to optimize heat removal design of the vault storage system in the present study. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

The fluence is obtained by measuring the elastic scattering produced by a composite thin target placed upstream of the sample. The absolute calibration is performed by comparison with the measured radioactivation of vanadium and copper samples. The composite thin target, made of aluminium, carbon and gold, allows not only the fluence to be measured, but also a continuous monitoring of the beam space distribution. Experimental results with a 27 MeV proton beam are reported and compared with Monte Carlo simulations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

First results of the in-pile and out-of-pile behavior of high-plutonium-content fuels with uranium, such as (U-55%,Pu-45%) O-2, and (U-55%,Pu-40%,Np-5%) O-2, and also without uranium, such as (Pu-44%,Ce-56%,)O-2, are now available. In particular, the Irradiation a FOrt Pu (IFOP) experiment in the SILOE reactor and the TRAnsmutation and Burning of ActiNides in Triox carrier (TRABANT1) experiments in the High Flux Reactor are presented and the results are analyzed: Up to a burnup of 1.5 at. %, destructive examinations of the IFOP pin have shown that the high-plutonium-content oxide fuel with a large central hole presents the usual global behavior (good pellet integrity, fuel microstructure). The TRABANT1 oxide fuel pin with a 40% Pu and 5% Np content demonstrates that a burnup of 9.5 at. % can be reached without failure by a high-plutonium-content fuel. However, the TRABANT1 pin 1 (oxide pin with 45% Pu), which had run under severe conditions, has failed at similar to 7 at. % burnup. Destructive examinations of these pins will give more evidence on the causes of the failure. The low-oxygen-to-metal fuel column of (Pu, Ce)O2-x melted, thus confirming the poor conductivity of this fuel.

The focus is on the adequacy of EOPs to limit primary-to-secondary leakage with particular emphasis on the number of ruptured U-tubes on the severity of an incident and the response time available for operator actions. By comparing test data with plant records of a Mihama-2 SGTR event, the key thermal-hydraulic phenomena during SGTR transients can be successfully simulated. The test results indicated that the current EOPs can function well in terminating the break flow and maintaining adequate core cooling. However the effectiveness in minimizing the radioactive release demands an early and substantial operator involvement. To mitigate the consequences of such an event, the timing to isolate the faulted steam generator (SG) and to terminate safety injection flow will be critical. Furthermore, to avoid overfilling, the water level in the faulted SG needs to be drained prior to the implementation of the cool-down process.

The total amount of these products almost equals the amount of the major intermediate phosphate products reduced, i.e., di- and monobutyl phosphates and phosphoric acid. Butyl alcohol was found to be the precursor of the other nonphosphate products. Even when the extremely degraded solvent was further contacted with 10 M nitric acid at 90 degrees C, no significant heat evolution was observed at atmospheric pressure. Only butyl alcohol changed into carboxylic acids by exothermic oxidative reactions.

Measurements cover the evolution of leachant composition and the release of radionuclides such as Cs, U, and Np. Performance of the waste forms and the self-shielded concrete waste containers depends on the pore volume of the hardened cement/concrete, which is correlated to the water/cement ratio of the waste forms. Cesium release follows a linear time dependence. Samples, especially those having a high pore volume, show almost complete release of Cs in. the period of investigation. Uranium release is independent of the leach period. Uranium concentrations are controlled by thermodynamic equilibrium Neptunium is released only to a small extent; concentrations are close to the detection limit. Modeling of the cement corrosion progress allows the prediction of the evolution of the brines in terms of pH, calcium concentration, etc. and the identification of solids controlling the solubilities of the main components and of uranium.

J	Okada, K; Nomura, M; Fujii, Y				Okada, K; Nomura, M; Fujii, Y			The self-ignition temperatures of bitumen mixtures containing transition metal nitrates	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						ignition temperature; bituminization; low-level waste		Information is provided on the self-ignition temperature (SIT) of blown bitumen asphalt mixed with sodium nitrate and some chemicals that are added in the bituminization process to adjust pH and to immobilize the radioactive isotopes of Cs, Sr, and I. In each ignition temperature test, the prepared bitumen sample was heated at a constant rate of temperature increase, and the ignition point was measured. Among the tested chemicals added to the bitumen, Ni(NO3)(2) shows a relatively large SIT decrease, and furthermore, the mixture of Ni(NO3)(2) and AgNO3 has been shown to greatly lower the SIT of blown bitumen. It is suggested that, in general, segregation of these nitrates should be avoided in bituminization, and care should be taken in handling Ag in a Purex reprocessing plant from the viewpoint of waste treatment. Furthermore, the oxidation effects of Fe (NO3)(3) were tested by measuring torque of the bitumen sample. It was confirmed that the addition of Fe(NO3)(3) to bitumen rapidly oxidizes the bitumen and increases the viscosity of the bitumen mixture.

The experimental validation of all the adopted design solutions is one of main concerns at design and calculation works carried out with the aim to create the CHC BTM. The in-pile test is one of the most important components of the bleeding zone feasibility validation. For validation of the CHC BTM breeding zone feasibility we have developed and fabricated two models and breeding blanket mock-up for testing in the IVV-2M reactor. The first model and mock-up contain pellets from lithium orthosilicate and porous beryllium, the second model contains pebbles from these materials. The tritium produced in the breeder material is purged by flow of neon at 0.1 - 0.2 MPa. The models structural material is ferrite martensite steel. A special processing installation has been designed, constructed and assembled at the IVV-2M reactor for study of the kinetics of tritium extraction from ceramics under the reactor irradiation. Designs of the models and experimental channel and results of neutronic and thermohydraulic calculations are presented in the paper.

However, it will take a long time to utilize FBRs due to a number of pending technical issues and improvements of cost efficiency. For the time being, therefore, light water reactors will continue to play a dominant role in power generation, thus, it is urgently necessary to establish the quasidomestic nuclear fuel cycle for them, especially in the field of enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing - a goal of the Japanese nuclear policy since the dawn. Furthermore, public acceptance is significant factor which must be considered. This can best be achieved by more safety performance of light water reactors and through publication of extensive information, including decisions by the industry and government.

We find discrepancies amongst the proposals regarding the technical definition of proliferation resistance, however there is a consistent focus on the importance of "physical form" as a key in determining a proliferation resistant fuel cycle. The reviewed proposals make little explicit mention the importance of the time to process the material to construct a nuclear weapon. While certain proposals discuss the importance of non-separation of plutonium from actinides, there are other proposals, which clearly do not view this aspect as vital in defining proliferation resistance. Recognizing that there are numerous political and infrastructure measures that may also be taken to guard against proliferation risks, we have focused here on the definition of proliferation resistance in terms of technical characteristics.

In recent years, environmental preservation concern has been increased for more efficient management of nuclear energy. Therefore it is necessary to apply Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology including environmental management system, waste reduction schemes and environmental analysis methods. In this study, LCA methodology is introduced to the nuclear power generation system and environmental burden caused by this system is assessed. This study suggests new methodology for environmental assessment and establishes the extensive infradatabase related with nuclear power generation system. Also, it is possible to improve the scientific basis of LCA with the emphasis on the nuclear power generation system. Therefore, this study consists of general framework of LCA such as goal and scope, inventory analysis, impact assessment, and valuation of the nuclear power generation system. The major objectives are to identify the environmental impact and the environmentally most dominant stage in life cycle of nuclear power generation system and to suggest the new methodology to solve the problem when LCA is applied to facility releasing the radioactive wastes. Thus this study is useful to improve the environmental impact assessment of nuclear power generation system and to promote the methodology of LCA. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Unak, T				Unak, T			What is the potential use of thorium in the future energy production technology?	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd International Symposium on Global Environment and Nuclear Energy Systems (GENES-3)	DEC 14-17, 1999	TOKYO, JAPAN	Tokyo Inst Technol, Res Lab Nucl Reactors, Japan Minist Educ Sci Sports & Culture, Atom Energy Soc Japan, Amer Nucl Soc, Japan Atom Ind Forum				Today's nuclear technology has principally been based on the use of fissile U-235 and Pu-239. While the natural thorium isotope Th-232 can finally be transformed to a fissile U-233 nucleus following a thermal neutron capture reaction, the existence of thorium in the nature and its potential use in the nuclear technology were not unfortunately into account with a sufficient importance. This was probably because of the geological availability of natural resources of thorium and uranium. Global distributions of thorium and uranium reserves clearly indicate that in general some developed countries such as the USA, Canada, Australia have considerable uranium reserves and contrarily only some developing countries such as Brazil, Turkey, India, Egypt have considerable thorium reserves as being totally about 70 % of the global reserve. All technical parameters obtained from the studies on thorium fuel cycle during the last 50 years indicate that thorium fuel cycle can be used in most of reactor types already operated. In addition, accelerated-driven hybrid systems promise to use the thorium based nuclear fuels. So, thorium will probably be a nuclear material much more valuable than uranium in the future. For this reason, all developing countries having thorium reserves should focus their technological attentions to the evaluation of their national thorium resources like in the case of India In this paper a brief story on the studies of thorium and its potential use in the future energy production technology have been summarized.

The HRS consists of improved fluoride volatility reprocessing and vibration packing MOX fuel fabrication processing. For the former, a part of U is volatilized as hexafluoride with diluted F-2 gas, and then residual U and Pu are volatilized with concentrated F-2 gas. Plutonium content of the mixed fluoride gas can be adjusted as desired by controlling the U fluorination reaction in the first step. The U is highly decontaminated and the mixture gas of UF6 and PuF6 is not purified. The fluoride mixture is reacted with H2O and H-2 and directly converted to the mixed oxide grain for the vibration packing. The HRS can reduce the costs of reprocessing and fuel fabrication, the amounts of radioactive wastes and the probability of Pu proliferation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Reducing high level radio-active wastes is defined in this paper as follows;The radio-toxicity of long lived radioactive nuclides is reduced by transmutation of MA and I-129 in core. The volume of container for high level radio-active wastes is reduced. I-129 is transmuted because it is easy to solve in underground water and needs additional barrier to confine. Sr-90 and Cs-137 are stored in the facility to decay naturally before disposal. In the reference core arrangement of this study, MA are transmuted in core and I-129 is transmuted around the active core. The following three items on MA transmutation are investigated: the arrangement of MA, Pu and U in core with the negative Doppler constant and high transmutation rate, the application for Pu and MA from Mixed Oxide (MOX) spent fuel from LWR, and the comparison of core type and fuel types. As for I-129 transmutation, the application of moderator to enhance I-129 transmutation rate, the comparison of core type and the scenario of transmutation through irradiation are discussed.

The FBR's annual production amounts of selected long-lived fission products (LLFPs), Se-79, Tc-99, Pd-107, I-129, Cs-135 and Sm-151, can be transmuted by using a radial blanket region and a part of a lower axial blanket region without any significant impact on its nuclear and safety characteristics. The other LLFPs are confined in the system. The hazard index level of the LLFPs per one ton of spent fuel from the system after 1000 years is as small as that of a typical uranium ore. To realize self-controllability (passive safety), the proposed FBR core concept employs gas expansion modules and sodium plenum above the core. To realize self-terminability, even if MOX fuel melting should cause a core compaction, recriticality of the core can be avoided by a fuel dilution and relocation module. The results show the MOX fueled FBR core has potential applicability to the SCNES. With the final goal of the ideal SCNES, fundamental applicability of various coolants and fuels is evaluated based on neutron balance. It is shown that the harder the core spectra is, the larger the potential for transmuting LLFPs would be. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, results of the PLACER conceptual design are presented by focusing on the estimated performance of the PEACER system. The proliferation resistance of PEACER is based upon both institutional and technical issues. The latter includes denaturing of fissile materials, Pu in particular, as well as the intense radiation field associated with the pyrochemical partitioning method. When the fuel volume fraction and the core aspect ratio(L/D) are optimized, the transmutation capability of PEACER for long-lived wastes from LWR spent fuels is found to exceed the production rate of two LWR's with the same electric rating. In contrast with current power reactor design principles, the lower power density and the higher neutron leakage rate lead to higher performance with respect to proliferation-resistance, transmutation capability and the accident-tolerance. Results of the present conceptual design show promising characteristics in all the five targets proposed by its name PEACER, which warrants more detailed study. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The water-cooled reactor which was designed to have tight lattice and lower Hydrogen/Heavy-Metal number density ratio (H/HM<0.5) showed enough neutronic potential to make the fuel cycle closed for actinides and could be feasible to be operated not as a breeder but as a self-fuel sustainer. The recycle system requires no external fissile supply and generates no actinide as waste except for the inevitable recovery loss, therefore the Uranium resource could be efficiently used and sustained for a long period similar to the case of sodium cooled system.

In this study, five kinds of fuel cycles of 3000 MWt pressurized water reactor (PWR) were investigated, and a method to determine the uranium enrichment in order to achieve their criticality was presented. The results indicated that the enrichment decreases significantly with increasing number of confined heavy nuclides when U is discharged from the reactor. The required natural uranium was also evaluated for two different enrichment processes. The amount of required natural uranium also decreases as well, which may agree with the systematic comparison of typical fuel cycles of PWR on the same condition for resource requirements and discharged radioactive wastes. On the other hand, when U is totally confined, the enrichment becomes unacceptably high. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The effects of higher Pu and minor actinide (MA) compositions on the transmutation rates have been studied for a typical mixed oxide (MOX)-fuel fast breeder reactor (FBR) core with 2600 MWt. The calculations showed that the transmutation rate for (Pu, MA) compositions from MOX -LWR becomes one half than that from UO2-light water reactor (LWR). Furthermore, MA accumulation and transmutation based on Double-Strata Scenario have been investigated for introducing the accelerator driven transmutation system (ADS) with 800 MWt. It was shown that in the scenario of nuclear plant capacities for maximum 140 GWe, which consists of LWRs and FBRs, the introduction of ADS can play a significant role as "Transmuter" in the back-end of fuel cycle.

The long-term ingestion radiotoxicity hazard of ROX spent fuel is one third and nearly one fourth of that of TOX and MOX spent fuels, respectively. This is because the discharged Pu and long lived Np in ROX fuel is less than that of TOX and MOX fuels. In TOX fuel, discharged Pu and MA are lower than that of MOX fuel but the long-term radiotoxicity hazard of spent fuel is nearly the same as MOX spent fuel. At the cooling 10(5) years, the radiotoxicity hazard of TOX spent fuel is approximately ten and three times higher than that of ROX and MOX spent fuels, respectively due to higher toxic contribution of Th-229 in TOX spent fuel.

The Hba molecule was found to coordinate to UO22+ in the form of anionic benzamidoximate (ba), and the number of ba coordinated to UO22+ was determined to be 3 by analyzing the chemical shift of C-13 NMR signal for Hba in the presence of UO22+ The exchange rate constants(k(ex)) of ba in [UO2(ba)(3)](-) were determined by the NMR line-broadening method. The kinetic parameters were obtained as follows: k(ex)(25 degreesC) 1.3 x 10(3) s(-1), DeltaH(not equal) = 35.8 +/- 3.5 kJ mol(-1), and DeltaS(not equal) = -65 +/- 13.7 J k mol(-1). The UV-visible absorption spectra of solutions containing UO22+ and Hba were also measured. The molar extinction coefficient of the complex was found to be extremely large compared with those of UO2(L)(5)(2+) (L = unidentate oxygen donor ligands) complexes. This is due to the strong electron withdrawing of UO22+ from Hba and suggests that an interaction between UO22+ and Hba is very strong. Such a high affinity of monomeric amidoxime to UO22+ reasonably explains the high adsorptibility of amidoxime resin to U(VI) species, and is considered to result in the high recovery of U(VI) species from sea water using amidoxime resin.

The absorption spectra of Ru2+ complexes were observed for only stable species such as [Ru(phen)(3)](2+) in supercritical water. The photochemistry of uranyl(VI)-tributylphosphate(TBP) complex in supercritical carbon dioxide(scCO(2)) was studied in the pressure range of 8-40 MPa and from 289 to 336K. In order to examine the hydrogen-bond structures and molecular motions of supercritical water and non-aqueous solvents, their H-1 spin-lattice relaxation times were measured under sub- and supercritical conditions by using high-pressure NMR. NiMo/Al2O3 was chosen as a catalyst because of its catalytic activity for hydrocracking aromatic structures. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

By using supercritical CO2 including chemical complexes of tri-n-buthylphosphate (TBP) and HNO3, lanthanide was recovered from oxide mixtures placed in a pressure vessel. The lanthanide oxide was dissolved with TBP-HNO3 and extracted with TBP in supercritical CO2. This cleaning method reduces volume amount of liquid waste arising from treatment of the contaminated materials. Being applied to a mixture of Gd2O3 and SrO, we found that Gd was selectively recovered and Sr was not found in the recovered solution. Gd was also selectively recovered when a mixture of Gd2O3 and ZrO2 was treated. This selective nature of decontamination is an additional advantage of the SFE with TBP-HNO3 complex. This method would be applicable to the selective cleaning of materials contaminated with radioactive oxides such as UO2/PuO2. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Pu(IV)- and U(VI)-TBP complexes involved in the el;traction reaction. The slopes a of the log D vs. log rho plots were -(1.6 +/- 0.1) and -(2.7 +/- 0.5) for the extraction of Pu(IV) and U(VI), respectively. The differences in D as well as the slope a between Pu(IV) and U(VI) make it possible to design the U and Pu separation method by which one can achieve an enhancement of the extraction efficiency and selectivity by tuning the operation pressure.

The areas that are covered by performance assessment range from the characterization of the waste and site to estimation of any potential dose to the public due to release of radionuclides over long periods of time (typically thousands of years). In developing new disposal sites, performance assessment has also been used as a screening tool for determining site suitability, a guide in site characterization, as well as a final technical analysis for license application. This paper provides a review of the current status of performance assessment models in the U.S. for civilian low-level radioactive waste (LLW) disposal facilities. (C) Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Dinh, TN; Konovalikhin, MJ; Sehgal, BR				Dinh, TN; Konovalikhin, MJ; Sehgal, BR			Core melt spreading on a reactor containment floor	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							VISCOUS GRAVITY CURRENTS; SURFACE; DOMES	The ex-vessel core melt spreading, cooling and stabilization is proposed for a nuclear power plant containment design. Clearly, the retention and coolability of the decay-heated core debris is very much the focal point in the proposed new and advanced designs so that, in the postulated event of a severe accident, the containment integrity is maintained and the risk of radioactivity releases is eliminated. The work reported here includes three tasks (i) to review related methodology and data base, (ii) to develop the scaling methodology and (iii) to validate the assessment methodology developed by the authors. The study is based on state-of-the-art knowledge of the melt spreading phenomenology, in particular, and, of severe accident phenomenology in general. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

On the absence of latent tracks in GeV ion irradiated graphite	RADIATION EFFECTS AND DEFECTS IN SOLIDS			English	Article						radiation effects; fullerene; graphite; particle tracks; latent tracks; electron microscopy; electronic sputtering; GeV ions	INDUCED EPITAXIAL REGROWTH; RADIATION-DAMAGE; AMORPHOUS-SILICON; ENERGETIC IONS; ELECTRON; AMORPHIZATION; CRYSTALLIZATION; CAF2	Irradiation of natural graphite with similar to 1 GeV lead and uranium ions initiates a phase change to fullerene (C-60) along the particle trajectories. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (Dunlop ct al. [II) reveals no tracks in the bulk in either kinematic or diffraction contrast. Small amoeboid-like surface patches ale formed however, random in distribution and proportional in number, but not equivalent to the total ion fluence. The evidence suggests that molecules of C-60 and other clusters are ejected from the entry and exit surfaces by electronic sputtering and are then deposited. A mechanism referred to as particle activated prompt anneal (or PAPAf is proposed to explain the absence of latent tracks in the bulk. A reverse cooling and annealing wave permits recovery by epitaxy of the disorder and phase changes induced by the primary heat wave. Radiation enhanced recovery processes may also play a role. PAPA can additionally explain the absence of induced fission fragment tracks in graphite, diamond, silicon and germanium.

The paper describes the integrated approach of the joint Concerted Action of the three organisations European Late Effect Group (EULEP), European Radiation Dosimetry Group (EURADOS) and International Union of Radioecology (IUR) which has been carried out and supported within the radiation protection research programme of the Fourth Frame Work Programme of the European Commission running from 1997 to 1999. An overview is given on the structure of the Concerted Action and the specific tasks in environmental dosimetry are described which have been performed during this action.

Over the past 50 years, a substantial store of data from experiment and observation has accumulated but. in many cases, the data are of insufficient accuracy. The question which the Environmental Transfer Action Group set out to answer was 'what do we know and what do we need to know about the movement and fate of radionuclides in the environment?' The following subjects are discussed: (i) soil-to-plant transfer: (ii) human metabolic studies with plutonium and (iii) intercomparison exercises with models: other topics will be presented by other speakers. The Action Group will have achieved its objective if it provides answers or initiates work which ultimately leads to improved input data to support calculations associated with the impact of radionuclides discharged to the environment.

J	Howard, BJ				Howard, BJ			The concept of radioecological sensitivity	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Environmental Dosimetry	NOV 22-24, 1999	AVIGNON, FRANCE				TIDE-WASHED PASTURES; IRISH SEA COAST; RADIONUCLIDES; RADIOCESIUM; ENGLAND; WALES	It is important to be able readily to identify major routes of exposure, the most highly exposed individuals or populations and the geographical areas of most concern arising from radioactive contamination. The critical group approach is used to identify sub-sections of the population who are likely to be most exposed. In this paper, the concept of radioecological sensitivity is explored with particular reference to methods of identifying spatial variation in radiation exposure. Radioecological sensitivity analysis attempts to integrate current knowledge on pathways, spatially attribute the underlying processes determining transfer and thereby identify the most radioecologically sensitive areas leading to high radiation exposure. This identifies where high exposure may occur and why, not only for humans, but also for other biota. It can consider single food products or species, or a number of key parameters to identify areas where a number of key pathways coincide. An example of radioecological sensitivity analysis is given for the Arctic. Prior identification of such areas and exposed individuals should improve the focus of emergency preparedness and planning, and contribute to environmental impact assessment for future facilities.

Furthermore, effluents from nuclear reactors and reprocessing plants under normal operating conditions contain radionuclides in particulate and colloidal form. Radioactive particles are also observed in the vicinity of radioactive waste dumped at sea. Following nuclear tests, the particle composition and characteristics were found to be device and shot dependent. Following high temperature accident scenarios (e.g. Chernobyl), fuel particles were released having a composition of refractory elements reflecting burnup. However, the release condition (explosion, fire) influenced the crystallographic structures and oxidation states of uranium in the fuel particles. Following low temperatures atmospheric releases (e.g. Windscale, early 1950s), fuel particle structures were significantly different from those released from the Chernobyl reactor. This paper focuses on source and release-dependent characteristics of radioactive particles, which in turn influence the behaviour of the associated radionuclides in the environment.

J	Thompson, IMG				Thompson, IMG			Technical recommendations an measurements of external environmental gamma radiation doses - A report of EURADOS Working Group 12 'environmental radiation monitoring'	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Environmental Dosimetry	NOV 22-24, 1999	AVIGNON, FRANCE					These recommendations provide guidance and information on the measurement of dose rates in the environment arising from photon radiation both from natural sources and from man-made sources. During the past decade there has been significant interest in the levels of radiation to which the general public is exposed, both from natural causes but particularly, since the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl accidents, to that arising from man-made operations. The public concern following the Chernobyl accident prompted many countries to introduce very comprehensive monitoring systems which included national networks of dose rate monitoring systems. These systems are aimed at providing Governments with prompt warning of radioactive releases, and accurate assessment of the predicted doses to the public, following accidents at nuclear installations within their own country and from installations in neighbouring and very remote countries. The measurement of dose rates from photon radiation in the neighbourhood of a nuclear installation is an essential part of any environmental measurement programme that is necessary to demonstrate that members of the public are not exposed to unacceptable levels of radiation arising from the operation of the installation. Apart from the technical difficulties of measuring such low dose rates, there are also problems in assessing their significance in relation to the comparable, but variable, dose rates from natural sources. To help improve the quality and accuracy of environmental radiation measurements within Europe, the Commission of the European Communities (CEC) sponsored intercomparison experiments during the past ten years. The purpose of this Technical Report is to disseminate the considerable experience and expertise gained by the participants during these intercomparisons. Practical advice is given on all aspects of environmental photon dose monitoring. The report starts by describing the nature and variability of environmental gamma radiation within Europe and then discusses the quantities that should be used for measurements. The characteristics and performance of both passive and active detectors as well as of spectrometry systems are discussed. Type testing and calibration methods are recommended which will enable the response of the monitoring equipment to the different radiation components to be properly determined. Techniques for assessing the uncertainties associated with both calibration and measurements are described. Examples are given of the early warning systems installed within European countries. It is hoped that this report will assist in the harmonisation of environmental photon dose measurements within Europe and the rest of the world.

The intercomparison was organised by the EURADOS, Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt (Germany) and the Riso National Laboratory (Denmark). This paper describes the free-field irradiation facilities at Rise and some details of the field intercomparison experiments performed at the Riso Natural Environmental Radiation Measurement Station during 3rd and 4th June, 1999. The chief aims of such experiments are to allow the participants to check their home calibrations of their detectors and to compare the responses of the individual environmental radiation measurement systems used in the different EU member states and making a link between the different reference standards used. Photon radiation fields, including ground and air scatter components, were determined for certified Co-60, Cs-137 and Ra-226 gamma sources using Monte Carlo calculations. It is shown that an agreement between the measured and the calculated values is typically within 1%. Also a simulation of a radioactive plume passing over the monitors during a certain time was made using a specially designed source set up in the field that was able to vary the air kerma rate from low activity Cs-137 sources additional to the natural air kerma rate. It is demonstrated that a typical environmental radiation detector can distinguish an increase of the ambient air kerma rate of less than 3%.

Among the important parameters which can influence the assessment of dose coefficients (doses per unit intake), four main parameters can be measured: the particle size distribution of aerosols: the isotopic composition; the dissolution parameters such as in vitro dissolution rates or in vivo absorption parameters to blood, which are the most relevant in terms of inhalation; and the gastrointestinal absorption factor, f(1), for ingestion. Numerous data are available on the physicochemical properties of nuclear particles including isotopic and radioactive composition, observations from scanning electron microscopy, geometric diameter and particle size distribution. In contrast, very few data exist either on in vitro dissolution compared with solubility in biological systems or on the biokinetics of radionuclides in vivo. Some examples of in vivo experiments have been chosen as a methodological guide for future experiments and to demonstrate the importance of the effect of specific parameters, such as absorption characteristics on the assessment of dose coefficients.

J	Hopewell, JW				Hopewell, JW			Biological effects of radioactive hot particles on the skin	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Environmental Dosimetry	NOV 22-24, 1999	AVIGNON, FRANCE				LIMITS	Exposure of the skin to beta irradiation from discrete radioactive 'hot particles' represents a difficult problem for radiological protection. The skin reactions of concern, which set the criteria for dose limitation, cannot be equated with those associated with more general radiation exposure of the skin. Only small volumes of skin are irradiated from a discrete hot particle and any resulting lesion depends on the energy of the beta ray emissions. For high and intermediate beta ray energies (greater than or equal to.9 MeV)the lesion of concern is acute dermal ulceration, while for low beta ray energies (less than or equal to 0.5 MeV) it is acute epidermal necrosis. The target cells, loss of which is responsible for these lesions are fibroblasts/endothelial cells and supra-basal epithelial cells, respectively, at depths in the skin of 100-150 mu m or similar to 50 mu m in the skin, respectively. Although biological studies suggest that a dose limit should be linked to a specified range of beta ray energies, practical considerations make a single dose limit, specified at a single depth, and averaged over a defined area a much more convenient approach. However, it must be emphasised that the biological differences make such an approach purely arbitrary. Based on this approach, a dose of 1 Gy, measured at 70 mu m depth and averaged over 1 cm(2), would prevent the deterministic effects irrespective of the energy of the beta ray emissions from a hot particle.

These claim an enhanced induction of malignant transformation following non-uniform compared with uniform irradiation. Enhancement factors, however, vary widely between studies. Even fewer animal studies are available and these too show divergent results. Determination of possible 'hot particle' enhancement factors is critically dependent on both reliable dosimetry and biological protocols. Some of these experiments are flawed for one or both of these reasons. In this study internationally validated protocols for dosimetry and malignant transformation in vitro have been used. Uniform and non-uniform sources of Sr-90/Y-90 and Tm-170 beta particles and 250 kV(p)Y rays were used to measure the induced transformation frequency in C3H 10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts. 'Hot particle' exposures were found not to be significantly different in their transforming ability (expressed as transformation frequency per surviving cell) than uniform irradiation, although moderate enhancement factors are possible. There are, however, suggestions of moderate enhancements for transformation frequency per cell at risk.
