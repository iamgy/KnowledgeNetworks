Ammonium carbonate is added to the feed to increase the pH of the solution. The effect of pH on the solubility of U; Th and Fe in an excess of ammonium carbonate is studied. This indicates that the solubility of Th and Fe is minimum at pH 7 and the recovery of uranium is maximum. The effect of the concentration of thorium and iron on the recovery of uranium at pH 7 is studied. This indicates that the ammonium carbonate precipitation tolerates 2 g/l of thorium and 10 g/l of iron keeping losses of uranium to a minimum. If the feed solution contains more than a tolerable concentration of thorium the precipitation is followed in two steps: (1) Bulk of the thorium is removed by oxalate precipitation, (2) the remaining thorium and iron in the supernatant are removed by ammonium carbonate precipitation. A flow sheet is proposed for the purification of U-233 from thorium and iron present in a strip product concentrate obtained during the reprocessing of irradiated thorium rods.

The ETS-IO samples were synthesised using either TiO2 or TiCl3 as a titanium source. The uptake of uranium on the materials was compared by determining the distribution coefficient and percentage sorption as a function of contact time, uranium concentration, and sorbent concentration. It was found that the difference in the synthesis procedures of the materials had a significant influence on the uptake of uranium.

"stored" or "disposed". in any case, it will be "intermediately stored". Therefore, many kinds of storage technologies have been developed and put into practice. In Japan, since it has been determined that "storage facilities away from reactor sites" would be operated by 2010, there has been growing tendency of practical use of storage technology. In this report, taking account of these situations, we investigated trends of spent fuel storage technologies and principal storage technologies that have been developed or put into practical use in the various countries (22 countries), which will be informative for technological development in Japan. The background, process of adoption, and progress of each storage technology (spent fuel storage pool, metal cask, silo, concrete cask and vault) were described. Besides, we classified those storage facilities in various countries from three points of view (location, storage form and safety function), and showed future direction of these storage technologies. Moreover, we mentioned the applicability of these storage technologies of the various countries to Japan.

J	Watanabe, N				Watanabe, N			Analysis of causes of criticality accidents at nuclear fuel processing facilities in foreign countries - Similarities to the criticality accident at JCO' s uranium processing plant	JOURNAL OF THE ATOMIC ENERGY SOCIETY OF JAPAN			Japanese	Article						JCO; criticality accidents; cause of accidents; overall trends; nuclear fuel processing facilities		On September 30, 1999, a criticality accident occurred at the JCO's uranium processing plant, which resulted in the first nuclear accident involving a fatality, in Japan, and forced the residents in the vicinity of the site to be evacuated and be sheltered indoors. Before the JCO accident, 21 criticality accidents have been reported at nuclear fuel processing facilities in foreign countries. The present paper describes the overall trends observed in the 21 accidents and discusses the sequences and causes of the accidents analyzed in terms of similarities to the JCO accident. Almost all of them occurred with the uranium or plutonium solution and in vessels/tanks with unfavorable geometry. In some cases, the problems similar to those observed in the JCO accident were identified: violations of procedures and/or technical specifications for improving work efficiencies, procedural changes without any application to and permission from the regulatory body, lack of understanding of criticality hazards, and complacency that a criticality accident would not occur.

Due to several features (e.g. very low noise at room temperature, information storage capability and a thin, homogeneous entrance window), the DEPFET concept is useful for various applications. In order to apply a DEPFET pixel detector in autoradiography, 64 x 64 matrices with a pixel size of 50 mum x 50 mum were built. Using several ASIC chips for the readout control and signal processing, a complete sensor system allows a row-by-row detector readout with almost continuous sensitivity.

It is based on the principle of the attenuation of radiation passing through matter, depending on the sample material and geometry. Besides the well-known radiographic examinations with X-rays and gamma -rays, neutron radiography provides an important endorsement to radiographic examinations in the field of non-destructive testing (NDT), as contrary to X-rays, neutrons are attenuated by some light materials, as hydrogen, boron and lithium but penetrate many heavy materials. Neutrons are even able to distinguish between different isotopes and besides, neutron radiography is an important tool for the investigation of radioactive materials. One of the key components of a radiography facility is the detector. Usually, it is a two-dimensional integrating imaging device. For neutron radiography applications requiring high quantitative precision as well as for neutron tomography investigations, a CCD-camera-based neutron radiography detector has been developed. It consists of a neutron sensitive scintillator screen, a nitrogen-cooled dow-scan CCD-camera and a mirror to reflect the light emitted by the scintillator to the CCD-camera. The whole assembly is placed in a light-tight enclosure. This paper presents the basic principle of this detector system, the strategy for the selection of the individual detector components, comparisons of the influence of the use of different components on the properties of the whole imaging device and results of the first test measurements.

ISOMAX was first flown in August 4-5, 1998, from Lynn Lake, Manitoba, Canada ISOMAX has a geometry factor of 450 cm(2) sr and was configured for this flight with a large, Helmholtz-like, superconducting magnet in combination with a drift-chamber tracking system, a state-of-the-art time-of-flight system and two aerogel Cherenkov detectors to measure light isotopes with a mass resolution of better than 0.25 amu. In the 1998 flight the obtained maximum detectable rigidity of the magnetic spectrometer was 970 GV/c for helium at 60% of the full magnetic field. ISOMAX took data for more than 16 h at float altitudes above 36 km. We here present the performance of the individual detectors and initial isotopic results of the instrument.

J	Shaanan, M; Kalish, R				Shaanan, M; Kalish, R			The simulation of SIMS measurements of light element profiles in diamond	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						ion-mass spectrometry; depth profiling; SIMS; ion-beam mixing; recoil implantation; ion transport in matter simulation	CARLO	Information about concentrations and profiles of impurities on or near surfaces is commonly obtained from secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) measurements. These may, however, yield misleading results when sharp profiles are measured. In this work, the results of computer simulations of SIMS measurements of light impurities (hydrogen, deuterium and lithium) on diamond are presented, using a modified version of the transport of ions in matter (TRIM) computer code which has been extended to include the continuously changing material during the SIMS profiling. The simulations show that elastic recoils, induced by the probing beam used in SIMS, can broaden an initially sharp profile and thus induce an apparent diffusion profile. The changes in matrix composition caused by the implantation of the probing beam can modify the depth scale. These are demonstrated by performing detailed computations for the technologically important cases of (i) a hydrogen-passivated diamond surface and (ii) a thin Li layer on top of a diamond surface. The results show that the exponential tail, experimentally measured by SIMS and interpreted as being due to diffusion of Li into diamond, can be fully explained by the art-effect of the SIMS measurement. Very good agreement between the simulated and measured SIMS profiles is obtained when it is assumed that Li is present only on the surface as a thin layer. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Variation of these detection efficiencies as a function of initial alpha -particles energies was investigated. Uranium and thorium contents have been determined in the studied samples by exploiting the data obtained for detection efficiencies of the SSNTD, utilized for alpha -particles from uranium and thorium families and measuring the resulting track densities.

J	Maucec, M				Maucec, M			Conceptual design of a clinical BNCT beam in an adjacent dry cell of the Jozef Stefan Institute TRIGA reactor	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							NEUTRON-CAPTURE THERAPY; PERSPECTIVE	The MCNP4B Monte Carlo transport code is used in a feasibility study of the epithermal neutron boron neutron capture therapy facility in the thermalizing column of the 250-kW TRIGA Mark II reactor at the Jozef Stefan Institute (JSI). To boost the epithermal neutron flux at the reference irradiation point, the efficiency of a fission plate with almost 1.5 kg of 20% enriched uranium and 2.3 kW of thermal power is investigated. With the same purpose in mind, the TRIGA reactor core setup is optimized, and standard fresh fuel elements are concentrated partly in the outermost ring of the core. Further, a derailed parametric study of the materials and dimensions for all the relevant parts of the irradiation facility is carried out. Some of the standard epithermal neutron filter/moderator materials, as well as "pressed-only" low-density Al(2)O(3) and AlF(3), are considered. The proposed version of the BNCT facility, with PbF(2) as the epithermal neutron filter/moderator, provides an epithermal neutron flux of similar to 1.1 x 10(9) n/cm(2).s, thus enabling patient irradiation times of <60 min. With reasonably low fast neutron and photon contamination ((D) over dot (nfast)/Phi(epi)(5 x 10(-13) Gy.cm(2)/n and (D) (gamma)/Phi(epi) < 3 x 10(-13) Gy.cm(2)/n), the in-air performances of the proposed beam are comparable to all existing epithermal BNCT facilities. The design presents an equally efficient alternative to the BNCT beams in TRIGA reactor thermal columns that are more commonly applied. The cavity of the dry cell, a former JSI TRIGA reactor spent-fuel storage facility, adjacent to the thermalizing column, could rather easily be rearranged into a suitable patient treatment room, which would substantially decrease the overall developmental costs.

J	Galperin, A; Segev, M; Todosow, M				Galperin, A; Segev, M; Todosow, M			A pressurized water reactor plutonium incinerator based on thorium fuel and seed-blanket assembly geometry	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								A pressurized water reactor (PWR)fuel cycle is proposed, whose purpose is the elimination and degradation of weapons-grade plutonium. This Radkowsky thorium-fuel Po incinerator(RTPI) cycle is based on a core and assemblies retrofittable to a Westinghouse-type PWR. The RTPI assembly: however. is a seed-blanket unit. The seed is supercritical, loaded with Pu-Zr alloy as fuel in a high moderator-to-fuel ratio configuration. The blanket is subcritical, loaded mainly with ThO2, generating and burning U-233 in situ. Blankets are loaded once every 6 yr. The seed fuel management scheme is based on three hatches, with one-third of the seed modules replaced every year. The core generates 1100 MW(electric). Equilibrium conditions are achieved with the second seed lending. For equilibrium conditions, the annual average of disposed (loaded) Po is 1210 kg, of which 702 kg are completely eliminated, and 508 kg are discharged but with significantly degraded isotopics (i.e., with a high percentage of even mass isotopes). Spontaneous fissions per second in a gram of this degraded Pu are similar to 500 resulting ill significantly increased proliferation resistance, Every 6 yr the blanket discharge contains 780 kg of U-233 (including Pa-233) and 36 kg of U-235. However, the blankets are initially loaded,with all amount of natural uranium selected such that these U fissile isotopes constitute only 12% of the total U discharge, a percentage equivalent to 20% U-235 enrichment; hence, both the discharged uranium isotopics satisfy proliferation-resistant criteria. The RTPI control variables, namely, the moderator temperature coefficient, the reactivity per ppm boron, and the control rods worth, are about equal to those of a PWR. The RTPI spent-fuel stockpile ingestion toxicity over a period often million years is about the same as the counterpart toxicities of a regular, or a mixed-oxide (MOX), PWR. Compared with known PWR MOX variants, the RTPI is, per 1000 MW(electric) and per annum, a significantly more efficient incinerator of weapons-grade plutonium.

J	El-Genk, MS; Saber, HH				El-Genk, MS; Saber, HH			Application of radio-frequency plasma glow discharge to removal of uranium dioxide from metal surfaces	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							NF3 PLASMA; SILICON; MASS	Recent experiments have shown that radio-frequency (rf) plasma glow discharge using NF3 gas is an effective technique for the removal of uranium oxide from metal surfaces. The results of these experiments are analyzed to explain the measured dependence of the UO2 removal or etch rate on the NF3 gas pressure and the absorbed power in the plasma. The NF3 gas pressure in the experiments was varied from 10.8 to 40 Pa, and the deposited power in the plasma was varied from 25 to 210 W The UO2 etch rate was strongly dependent on the absorbed power and to a lesser extent, on the NF3 pressure and decreased Exponentially with immersion time. At 210 W and 17 Pa, all detectable UO2 in the samples (similar to 10.6 mg each) was removed at the endpoint, whereas the initial etch rate was similar to 3.11 mu m/min. When the absorbed power was less than or equal to 50 W however, the etch rate was initially similar to 0.5 mu g/min and almost zero at the endpoint, with UO2 only partially etched This self-limiting etching of UO2 at low power is attributed to the formation of nonvolatile intermediates UF2, UF3, UF4, UF5, UO2F, and UO2F2 on the surface. Analysis indicated that the accumulation of UF6 and to a lesser extent, O-2 near the surface partially contributed to the exponential decrease in the UO2 etch rate with immersion time. Unlike fluorination with F-2 gas, etching of UO2 using rf glow discharge is possible below 663 K. The average etch rates of the amorphous UO2 in the NF3 experiments are comparable to the peak values reported in other studies for crystalline UO2 using CF4/O-2 glow discharge performed at similar to 150 to 250 K higher sample temperatures.

In order to optimize the production of high-energy neutrons the behaviour of deuteride titanium targets has been studied experimentally by bombardment with 120 and 350 kV deuterons by means of electrostatic accelerators. The importance of the deposit evaporation conditions on the efficiency of neutron emission is clearly demonstrated as well as the thermomechanical stability of the Ti thin film by deuteron bombardment. The main parameters involved in the targets behaviour have been discussed from a thermodynamical approach. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The technique would not require nuclear material Standards for the measurement of 235U enrichment. It uses a gamma-ray spectrometer composed of a high-resolution germanium detector system and associated electronics. A new mathematical analysis - based on Monte Carlo calculations - has been developed for the estimation of U-235 enrichment. The obtained results are found to be of comparable accuracy with the results obtained by the relative methods which necessitate the use of nuclear material Standards. This work would be very useful for nuclear material control at the production level, and for inventory verification and safeguards purposes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The segmentation of the calorimeter is sensitive to the longitudinal and transverse particle energy deposition within the calorimeter. The phase space probability method is used to identify muons. It is based on Monte Carlo simulations, with the help of which we construct the muon probability function in the multi-dimensional phase-space of the calorimeter signals. A feed-forward neural network is used to identify electromagnetic showers. Both methods separate leptons with high efficiency and a low level of hadron contamination.

As a case study, this model was applied to Korean nuclear fuel cycle alternatives including DUPIC(Direct Use of spent PWR fuel In CANDU) fuel cycle. The main features of the model are that political issues as well as technical issues relevant to the proliferation resistance can be included, and also all facilities and activities in a specific nuclear fuel cycle, from mining to disposal, can be considered. It appeared that the resistance index derived using an electrical circuit concept could be used as an international measure for the risk of nuclear proliferation. From the case study, it seems that the DUPIC fuel option in Korea could be strongly competitive with the reprocessing option in respect of nuclear proliferation resistance.

While thermal neutron filters like boron or lithium can be used to reduce this activation, it can never be completely eliminated by this approach since high energy neutrons can penetrate the detector and thermalize inside it. This activation results in the emission of prompt gamma rays from both the I and Na and the production of the radioisotopes I-128 and Na-24 that subsequently decay and emit their characteristic beta particles and gamma rays. The resulting three spectra represent a background for this measurement. An experimental method for obtaining these three spectra is described and results are reported for 2 " x 2 ", 5 " x 5 ", 6 " x 6 ", and 1 " x 6 " NaI detectors using the thermal neutron beam of the NCSU PULSTAR nuclear reactor. In addition, Monte Carlo simulation programs have been developed and used for simulating these spectra. Good results have been obtained by the Monte Carlo method for the two radioisotope spectra, and it is anticipated that good results will also be obtained for the prompt gamma-ray spectrum when the I and Na coincidence schemes are known.

New energy values have been measured using Cl-35 neutron-capture gamma rays, while the gamma-ray production cross-sections have been determined with respect to the H-1 thermal capture cross-section. The elemental data have been compared with thermal neutron-capture data for individual nuclides from the Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data File, ENSDF, hence isotope identifications could be made. The catalogue contains elemental spectra and a table with nearly 7000 gamma rays with relative intensity over 1% of the strongest line. The average accuracy is about 0.08 keV for energies and about 5% for cross-sections in the whole energy range, from about 40 keV to 11 MeV. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

For example, enrichment measurements are often fit to two predictors: Poisson-distributed count rates in the region of interest and in the background. Both count rates have at least random variation due to counting statistics. Therefore, the parameter estimates will be biased. In this case, the effect of bias is a minor issue because there is almost no interest in the parameters themselves. Instead, the parameters will be used to convert count rates into estimated enrichment. In other cases, this bias source is potentially more important. For example, in tomographic gamma scanning, there is an emission stage which depends on predictors (the "system matrix") that are estimated with error during the transmission stage. In this paper, we (1) provide background information for the impact and treatment of errors in predictors, (2) present results of candidate methods of compensating for the effect, (3) review some of the nondestructive assay situations where errors in predictors occurs, and (4) provide guidance for when errors in predictors should be considered in nondestructive assay.

Among the uses are the fabrication of films sensitive to pH, temperature, the presence of dissolved chemicals in solutions and many others. This paper describes the use of sol-gel technology for the doping of B-10, Li-6 and U-235 into glass films applied to silicon surface barrier (SSB) detectors. Using a commercial preamp/amplifier and an IEEE-488 NIM counter, the response was recorded of the neutron profile in a neutron activation source. A portable personal computer recorded the thermal neutron map as the detector was lowered in 1.27-cm steps down a Numec thermal neutron activation source. The lithiated glass film on the SSB gave about four times the count rate of the boron-10 doped glass film. The U-235 doped glass film gave a much lower count rate, but maintained a constant output signal due to the presence of the alpha activity from the U-235 and the trace of U-234 present in the sample.

As such, it represents the first commercial application of a confined fusing plasma. The Star-Mode discharge is an essential feature of this device since it minimizes ion-grid collisions and also allows tight beam focussing. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

A source the size of a person's little finger can emit up to 10(11) neutrons s(-1). Californium-252 is used commercially as a reliable, cost-effective neutron source for prompt gamma neutron activation analysis (PGNAA) of coal, cement and minerals, as well as for detection and identification of explosives, land mines and unexploded military ordnance. Other uses are neutron radiography, nuclear waste assays, reactor start-up sources, calibration standards and cancer therapy. The inherent safety of source encapsulations is demonstrated by 30 yr of experience and by US Bureau of Mines tests of source survivability during explosions. The production and distribution center for the US Department of Energy (DOE) Californium Program is the Radiochemical Engineering Development Center (REDC) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), DOE sells (252)Cf to commercial reencapsulators domestically and internationally. Sealed (252)Cf sources are also available for loan to agencies and subcontractors of the US government and to universities for educational, research and medical applications. The REDC has established the Califoinium User Facility (CUF) for Neutron Science to make its large inventory of (252)Cf sources available to researchers for irradiations inside uncontaminated hot cells. Experiments at the CUF include a land mine detection system, neutron damage testing of solid-state detectors, irradiation of human cancer cells for boron neutron capture therapy experiments and irradiation of rice to induce genetic mutations.

Close to the target, and along the path of incidence of axially symmetric deuteron beams, the transverse density of accelerated deuterons is assumed to be governed by a law approximated by the 'Witch' function. In particular circumstances, the elementary neutron emission process in nondispersive media can be considered to be omni-directional (due consideration being paid to collision kinetics, depending upon mass and kinetic energy of particles involved in the nuclear collision, nuclear reaction energy, etc.). Consequently, analytical expressions can be considerably simplified. By applying the classical kinetic energy and momentum conservation laws to nuclear processes, a theoretical description is obtained, taking into account the exoergic character of d-T fusion reaction. A number of expressions for energetic prediction of the fast neutron field are proposed. The associated relations, involving elementary functions, can be investigated using a desk-top computer. Computationally tractable tools are of importance in the study of diverse situations such as induced reactions and activation analysis using 14 MeV neutron generators, investigations in health-physics, radiation dose measurements, nuclear medicine, damage effects, and simulation studies.

This is certainly true for Industrial Radiation and Radioisotope Measurement Applications - IRRMA. The reasons for this include: (1) the increased cost and inadequacy of experimentation for design and interpretation purposes; (2) the availability of low cost, large memory, and fast personal computers; and (3) the general availability of general purpose Monte Carlo codes that are increasingly user-friendly, efficient, and accurate. This paper discusses the history and present status of Monte Carlo simulation for IRRMA including the general purpose (GP) and specific purpose (SP) Monte Carlo codes and future needs - primarily from the experience of the authors.

Deterministic techniques need many approximations to solve this kind of problem. On the other hand, the Monte Carlo method is a reliable mathematical tool for evaluating the neutron resonance escape probability. But it suffers from large statistical deviations of results and long computation times. In order to overcome this problem, we have used the Splitting and Russian Roulette technique coupled separately to the survival biasing and to the importance sampling for the energy parameter. These techniques have been used to calculate the neutron resonance absorption in infinite homogenous media containing hydrogen and uranium characterized by the dilution (ratio of the concentrations of hydrogen to uranium). The punctual neutron source energy is taken at E-s = 2 MeV and E-s = 676.45 eV, whereas the energy cut-off is fixed at E-c = 2.768 eV. The results show a large reduction of computation time and statistical deviation, without altering the mean resonance escape probability compared to the usual analog simulation. The Splitting and Russian Roulette coupled to the survival biasing method is found to be the best methods for studying the neutron resonant absorption, particularly for high energies. A comparison is done between the Monte Carlo and deterministic methods based on the numerical solution of the neutron slowing down equations by the iterative method results for several dilutions.

Some of this waste is in an interim store at the Karlsruhe Research Center operated by its Decontamination Division (HDB). The store also contains around 30,000 drums of radwaste from the research center itself as well as local institutions. Germany's Federal Government anticipates that interim storage will be necessary for a further 30 years until a suitable final repository goes into operation. However, since the waste drums were not designed for such a long period of storage, other steps must now be taken to ensure safe interim storage in the long term. The objective is to condition the existing waste drums as well as future waste arisings in accordance with the 1989 regulatory guideline on non-heat-generating radioactive waste such that they satisfy the acceptance criteria applicable since 1995 for final disposal at the Konrad repository. The drums al-e to be immobilized in concrete inside Konrad containers designed for long-term corrosion resistance in order to obtain waste packages that can be safely stored for a prolonged period without maintenance. If the activity limit for the container is not reached, low-level waste can be added as an aggregate to the concrete, which occupies around half the volume of each container, in order to save storage capacity at the repository. This waste conditioning, to be performed at HDB and Siemens RE, will convert around 65% of all non-heat-generating waste in Germany to a form that is suitable for final storage and is maintenance-free.

This discrepancy casts doubts on the DS86 neutron source term and, consequently, the survivors' estimated neutron doses. However, the doses were caused mainly by fast neutrons. To determine retrospectively fast neutron fluences in Hiroshima, the reaction Cu-63(n, p)Ni-63 can be used, if adequate copper samples can be found. Measuring Ni-63 (half life 100 y) in Hiroshima samples requires a very sensitive technique, such as accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), because of the relatively small amounts of Ni-63 expected (similar to 10(5)-10(6) atoms per gram of copper). Experiments performed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have demonstrated in 1996 that AMS can be used to measure Ni-63 in Hiroshima copper samples. Subsequently, a collaboration was established with the Technical University of Munich in view of its potential to perform more sensitive measurements of Ni-63 than the Livermore facility and in the interest of interlaboratory validation. This paper presents the progress made at the Munich facility in the measurement of Ni-63 by AMS. The Munich accelerator mass spectrometry facility is a combination of a high energy tandem accelerator and a detection system featuring a gas-filled magnet. It is designed for high sensitivity measurements of long-lived radioisotopes. Optimization of the ion source setup has further improved the sensitivity for Ni-63 by reducing the background level of the Cu-63 isobar interference by about two orders of magnitude. Current background levels correspond to a ratio of Ni-63/Ni<2x10(-14) and suggest that, with adequate copper samples, the assessment of fast neutron fluences in Hiroshima and Nagasaki is possible for ground distances of up to 1500 m, and-under favorable conditions-even beyond. To demonstrate this capability, we have measured successfully Ni-63/Ni ratios as low as (3.5 +/- 0.6) x 10(-13). The latter are, based on DS86, representative of a ratio expected from a typical Hiroshima copper sample at about 1,300-m ground range.

Because the preponderance of households do not have members who smoke indoors, studies of non-smoking miners contribute essential data for risk assessments for residential radon progeny exposure. We studied a cohort of 2,209 never-smokers who were underground uranium miners employed in the western U.S. from 1956 to the early 1990's and who participated in a screening program for lung cancer conducted by Saccomanno and colleagues. After determining the vital status and cause of death in the cohort, we conducted a nested case-control study of 55 lung cancer deaths in males and 3 age-matched controls for each case. The relative risk of lung cancer was 29.2 (95% CI 5.1, 167.2) for miners with greater than 1,450 WLM compared with those exposed to less than 80 WLM. Temporal factors affected risk, including average dose rate, which was inversely associated with lung cancer risk, and the length of time since last exposure, which was directly associated with decreased risk. As in studies of non-smokers and smokers combined, the exposure response relationship in never-smokers was consistent with a decreased slope at higher WLM, which resulted, in part, from an inverse dose rate effect.

Radioactivity concentrations of primordial naturally occurring K-40, Th-232, U-238 and of anthropogenic Cs-137 in a sand plot were measured in situ at the two heights. Independently, six fractions of a soil profile collected in the site were measured in the laboratory. Good agreement was found between the results of the two geometries and the soil samples. Good agreement between measured and predicted radioactivity concentration values was obtained for hot spots simulated by uniform planar sources of K-40, Co-60 and Cs-137 having a circular pattern 0.5 m in diameter. The study shows that an in situ measurement without a collimator but close to a hot spot can provide a reliable result.

J	Sharma, RC; Abani, MC				Sharma, RC; Abani, MC			Internal dosimetry of plutonium using the late urinary excretion	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						dosimetry, internal; plutonium; excretion, urinary; computer calculations	PU-239	An attempt has been made to standardize the methodology of internal dose computation from the late urinary excretion data. The methodology was selected keeping in mind the most recent ICRP publications and the results of internal dosimetry intercomparison studies reported in literature. The key element of this methodology is the PC-based computational software LUDEP 2.05, which implements the new model of the human respiratory tract. Late urinary excretion data of three male subjects involved in accidental intakes of plutonium aerosols more than 25 years ago were interpreted in terms of intakes and internal doses with the aid of the standardized methodology. An important implication of this work is that late urinary excretion data of the occupational workers of any plutonium handling facility could be used to show the compliance with the life-time dose limit.

J	Tymen, H; Gerasimo, P; Hoffschir, D				Tymen, H; Gerasimo, P; Hoffschir, D			Contamination and decontamination of rat and human skin with plutonium and uranium, studied with a Franz's chamber	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION BIOLOGY			English	Article								Purpose: Our work offers a new method of assessing human skin radiocontamination and of appraising its treatment. This in vitro technique stems from methods used in skin pharmacology. Materials and methods: Franz's diffusion chambers, which help maintain the physiological condition of a skin biopsy, are used to study how U-233 and Pu-239, added to a 0.1 N solution of nitric acid, could enter skin. The efficiencies of two different decontaminating agents (Na3Ca)DTPA (25%) and EHBP (0.5 M) are compared. These studies were made on human skin samples, recovered after plastic surgery. Parallel experiments were carried out on hairless rat skin biopsies and on the skin of live hairless rats. Results: Results in vivo and in vitro on the rat were not significantly different which validates the in vitro technique. In human beings, most of the radioactivity was found in the epidermis, with 2-4% found at the level of the dermis. By means of autoradiography we were able to identify that this radioactivity was concentrated in and around hair and sebaceous glands. Local treatments by EHBP seemed more efficient than those by DTPA in decorporating uranium and plutonium hut the complexes radionuclide-EHBP seemed to diffuse through the skin more than the radionuclide-DTPA complexes if the skin was not rinsed after application of the chelating agent. Conclusion: This new in vitro technique using human skin has been validated for radiotoxicology. It can be used to quantify the diffusion of radionuclides through the various skin layers and to assess the efficiency of decontaminating agents.
