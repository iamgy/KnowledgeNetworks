Some of the critical parameters for power plant operation and design of the first wall, blanket and shield, are the sufficient production of tritium needed for sustaining the fusion reaction, the neutron and photon heating rates of the various components and the displacement damage of the structural material. The concept under consideration is of the double null configuration, operating at 4.0 GW of fusion power, with an aspect ratio of 1.4, and a wall loading at the midplane of 5 MW m(-2). The structural material is assumed to be 9% Cr-martensitic stainless steel, and the coolant helium gas, with the exception of the copper alloy central column which is pressurised water cooled and uses vanadium alloy as the structural material. The neutron multiplier and tritium generating materials are varied to optimise tritium production, the preferred option being a combination of beryllium and lithium oxide. Taking into consideration the relatively severe thermal and neutron induced loading in the spherical tokamak, the main features of this design are the first wall structure which is independent of the blanket, and the radial ribs that occupy all the space under the toroidal field coils. Detailed neutronics calculations have been carried out, in both one (radial, infinite cylinders) and two (radial-poloidal, toroidally axisymmetric) dimensions, to obtain the neutron spectrum, heating rates, tritium generation and displacement damage at various locations around the machine. In one-dimensional calculations the tritium generation ratio values are in the range of 1-1.5 depending on several factors, such as the first wall thickness and multiplier to tritium generating materials ratio in the blanket. The two-dimensional calculations, with a mixture ratio of beryllium to lithium oxide 4: 1, result in a tritium generation ratio of 1.34, which is within the design target. Of importance are the materials used as a shield for the central column. Various shields have been analysed and one concept that gave good results was the combination of tungsten-carbide, and vanadium alloy with helium cooling. The results of neutronic calculations for the displacement damage give a maximum dose at the first wall of 55 dpa year (-1) for the martensitic steel and 2.1 dpa year(-1) for the outer layer of the copper alloy central column at the midplane. These dose values give in-service lifetimes within the minimum design target of 2 years for the structural material and 6 years for the copper alloy in the central column.

Wong, R. Cerbone, E.T. Cheng, R.L. Miller, R.D. Stambaugh, Proc. of 17th IEEE/NPSS Symp. on Fusion Engineering, pp. 1053) indicated that a 2 GW(e) reactor can have a major radius as small as 2.9 In resulting in a device with competitive cost of electricity at 49 mill/kWh. One of the technology requirements of this design is a high performance high power density first wall and blanket system. A 15 MPa helium-cooled, V-alloy and stagnant LiPb breeder first wall and blanket design was utilized. Due to the low solubility of tritium in LiPb, there is the concern of tritium migration and the formation of V-hydride. To address these issues, a lithium breeder system with high solubility of tritium has been evaluated. Due to the reduction of blanket energy multiplication to 1.2, to maintain a plant Q of > 4, the major radius of the reactor has to be increased to 3.05 m. The inlet helium coolant temperature is raised to 430 degreesC in order to meet the minimum V-alloy temperature limit everywhere in the first wall and blanket system. To enhance the first wall heat transfer, a swirl tape coolant channel design is used. The corresponding increase in friction factor is also taken into consideration. To reduce the coolant system pressure drop, the helium pressure is increased from 15 to 18 MPa. Thermal structural analysis is performed for a simple tube design. With an inside tube diameter of 1 cm and a wall thickness of 1.5 mm, the lithium breeder can remove an average heat Aux and neutron wall loading of 2 and 8 MW/m(2), respectively. This reference design can meet all the temperature and material structural design limits, as well as the coolant velocity limits. Maintaining an outlet coolant temperature of 650 degreesC, one call expect a gross closed cycle gas turbine thermal efficiency of 45%. This study further supports the use of helium coolant for high power density reactor design. When used with the low aspect ratio reactor concept a competitive fusion reactor can be projected at 51.9 mill/kWh. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

CREST-1 (Compact REversed Shear Tokamak), a conceptual design of water-cooled commercial reactor based on a reversed shear high beta equilibrium, has been proposed as a possible scenario to an economical and feasible reactor succeeding the ITER project. In the present design study, a possibility of cost competitive fusion power plants with water-cooled concept, which has much experience in nuclear power plants, was examined. The new blanket design is based on the low activation ferritic steel components and an advanced super-heated steam cycle, which is used to realize a high thermal efficiency. High value of the thermal efficiency is very effective for reduction of the cost of electricity. On designing the blanket, allowable temperature range of the structure material, low activation ferritic steel is assumed to be 350-900 K with an expectation of the material research and development. Mixture of lithium oxide pebbles and beryllium pebbles is installed in the breeding zone for high tritium breeding ratio and high thermal conductivity of the breeding zone. Mixture ratio of beryllium and lithium-6 enrichment were optimized from viewpoints of temperature distribution in the breeding zone, achievable tritium breeding ratio and its reduction due to burn up. The designed blanket system has approximately 1.4 of local tritium breeding ratio with a 1.0 mm thickness of zirconium plate which is placed at 24 cm from the plasma surface as a conducting shell for kink stabilization. Arrangements of cooling channels and breeding zones and now rate and inlet temperature of the coolant were also optimized to keep the temperatures of structure materials, breeding materials and coolant in the allowable range. The first wall is cooled by pressurized water at about 570 K. The coolant out of cooling channels of the first wall is lead to those of breeding zone and starts partially boiling. The steam is super-heated up to 750 K in the blanket. This high temperature raises the thermal efficiency of turbine to 41%. Our cost assessment has shown that CREST-1 generates about 1.16 GWe electric power within a competitive COE range. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

The adjustment of the material composition of these materials to increase the fraction of shallow land burial in Japan was considered. In Japan, the fission waste having any single radionuclide exceeding the limiting concentration value, causing 100 mu Sv year(-1) individual dose, determined by the Nuclear Safety Commission will not qualify as a low level waste (LLW), which could be disposed by shallow land burial. The limiting concentration values of radionuclides produced in fusion reactor were derived based on the methodology of the Nuclear Safety Commission. Radionuclide concentrations of the radwastes generated From the fusion power reactors using the three low activation materials based on the composition of existing materials were evaluated. Radwastes are classified into LLW and medium level waste (MLW), which is defined as the waste which does not qualify for LLW because one or more of the radionuclides exceeds the derived limiting concentration value. The weight fraction of MLW among the sum of LLW and MLW is found to be 10% for ferritic steel, 54% for V-alloy and 43% for SiC/SiC. The possibility of decreasing the MLW fraction by the material composition adjustment is considered. It is found that if Nb impurity content in V-alloy and N impurity content in SiC/SiC composite could be reduced, the MLW fraction can be significantly decreased. On the other hand, the content of the alloy component material (W), needs to be reduced to further decrease the MLW fraction in case of the ferritic steel F82H. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

However, the sizable increases that were forecast for future electrical power demands have not been realized to date. Only coal power plants have been increasing (3%/year) generating capacity (Annual Energy Outlook, 1998) [1]. Likewise, the ability of fusion to deliver economical electrical power has not been credibly postulated, much less demonstrated. Together these two factors have stagnated the commercialization of fusion power. It is now time for a reassessment of what fusion can best do for the world. Fusion, with a practically inexhaustible energy supply, has many unique properties that enable a wide variety of useful products. A study by the ARIES team is underway to review possible fusion applications and assess those with the potential to provide useful and worthwhile new products. A roadmap of possible applications has been developed to assess the utilization of the unique properties of the fusion process. The potential product categories are energy production (fuel, electricity, heat), space propulsion, altered or transmuted material properties (transmutation, waste treatment, tritium production), chemical compound dissociation (waste treatment, ore reduction, refining), and direct use of fusion nuclear products (radiography, lithography, radiotherapy, activation analyses). An evaluation methodology based on the success and failure of previous large, national and international technology development projects was developed to assess and recommend encouraging fusion product applications. A list of significant attributes was defined to describe and characterize projects that are likely to succeed or fail in the global marketplace. These attributes were assigned weights according to their perceived value to the national or global enterprise. An additive utility theory methodology was used to qualitatively evaluate the proposed applications ill terms of market potential, environmental considerations, economic impact, risk and public perception. Quantified values were assigned to each potential fusion application and market to make more intelligent decisions on the allocation of Future resources. Incorporating some of the long term market trends suggested in the December 1997 Kyoto Climate Change Conference, the most favored fusion applications were found to be the production of hydrogen fuels, transmutation of nuclear wastes and dissociation of chemical compounds, all slightly ahead of electricity production. The results from this decision analysis process will help balance the benefits of success against the risks of failure to help select promising products for future study.

The degrees of fabrication process freedom are closely investigated to allow the construction of complex shapes. Another important consideration is the activation behaviour of the structural material. The ideal solution is the recycling of the structural materials after a relatively short 'cooling' period. The structural materials development in Europe has three streams. The first serves the design and construction of ITER and is closely connected to the choice made: water cooled austenitic stainless steel. The second development stream is to support the design and construction of DEMO relevant blanket modules to be tested in ITER. The helium cooled pebble bed and the water cooled liquid lithium concept rely both on RAFM steel. The goal of the third stream is to investigate the potential of advanced materials for fusion power reactors beyond DEMO. The major contending materials: SiCSiC composites, vanadium, titanium and chromium alloys hold the promise of high operating temperatures, but RAFM has also a high temperature potential applying oxide dispersion strengthening. The development of materials for fusion power application requires a high flux 14MeV neutron source to simulate the fusion power environment. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

J	Numata, H; Ohno, I				Numata, H; Ohno, I			In situ potentiometric, resistance, and dilatometric: Measurements of palladium electrodes during repeated electrochemical hydrogen absorption	FUSION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							NEUTRON EMISSION; HEAVY-WATER; ELECTROLYSIS; DEUTERIUM; DIFFUSION; METALS; PD	The physicochemical properties of the Pd-H system were studied by in situ potentiometric, resistance, and dilatometric measurements in each of three applied pulse modes, A, B, and C, and repented H absorption and desorption. Potential, resistance ratio, and an increase in dilation (Delta l/l(0)) were measured simultaneously after H equilibrium was attained with the Pd electrode. During continous absorption, structural phase transition (alpha-->beta) and void formation occurred, and the values of the H/Pd ratio in the limiting a phase, in the alpha + beta phase coexistence, and in the transition and the beta + voids coexistence regions are consistent with those obtained from the Pd-H isotherm at 40 degrees C. Hydrogen absorption caused the dilation, from whose slope the molar volume was obtained as 0.64 (alpha phase) and 0.40 (alpha + beta phase) cm(3)/mol. The resistance increased in proportion to the H/Pd ratio and was kept constant at 1.7 to 1.8 over R-tr. For the first absorption through the beta phase (>beta(min)), the electrode potential shifted with an increase in dilution, which suggests nonequilibrium PdH2-x precipitation followed by conversion to the beta phase and void formation. Although there was a remarkable lack of any dependence on the number of repetitions of the I,values of the limiting resistance and potential corresponding to the alpha + beta and beta + vain coexistence, the onset of the beta phase, beta(min), increased as the number of repetitions increased. The volumetric ratio for an increase in the H/Pd ratio corresponds to the absorption in high-density defect areas surrounding voids.

Similar measurements were performed with the, Au/Pd/PdO:D heterostructure as a control. it has been established that in experiments with the Au/Pd/PdO:D system, the excessive 2.45-MEV neutrons and 3.0-MeV I. INTRODUCTION protons are better detected than with the Au/Pd/PdO:D system, where those detection rates for n and p did not exceed the cosmic background level. The levels of neutron and proton emissions for 40- to 60-mu m-thick samples are found to be close to one another and after subtracting background (Au/Pd/PdO:H count rate) consist of I-n = (19 +/- 2) . 10(-3) n/s and I-p = (4.0 +/- 1.0) . 10(-3) p/s in a 4 pi solid angle, respectively. These yields of D-D reaction products in Au/Pd/PdO heterostructure comply with the mean D-D reaction rate of lambda dd similar to 10(-23) s(-1) per D-D pair.

Samples of such lenses have been etched to reveal that radon and radon progeny alpha tracks can be seen in abundance, and sensitivities have been calibrated in radon chambers as a primary calibration and with a uranium-based source of alpha particles as a convenient secondary standard. Natural, environmental (fossil) track densities ranged from 3,000 to 25,000 cm(-2) for eyeglasses that had been worn for various times from 1 to nearly 5 y. Average radon concentrations to which the wearers were exposed are inferred to be in the range 20 to 130 Bq m(-3) (0.5 to 3.5 pCi L-1). Procedures for consistent, meaningful readout are described.

The areal deposition at the nine sampling sites is in the range of <500 to 6,100 Bq m(-2) and 300 to 7,900 Bq m(-2) for Sr-90 and Cs-137, respectively. Similar values have been reported in the literature. At some of the sites both nuclides mainly have remained in the top 6 cm of the soil profiles; at others they were partly transported into deeper soil layers since the deposition. For most of the samples the Sr-90 yield after destruction of the soil matrix is significantly higher than after extracting with 6 M HCl indicating that Sr-90 is partly associated with fused silicates. The low mean Sr-90 activity concentrations of vegetation samples (14 Bq kg(-1) dw) and milk samples (0.05 Bq kg(-1) fw) suggest that this has favorable consequences in terms of limiting its bioavailability.

In the event of an accident, another possible pathway for dose would be through ingestion of locally produced contaminated food-stuffs. A model, AXINGST, has been developed that would incorporate this pathway. Currently available ingestion models were referenced as a basis for AXINGST. The model calculates an ingestion dose following an atmospheric release of radionuclides and includes site-specific variables where applicable. AXINGST estimates tritium vegetation concentrations that are within a factor of 20-40 of measured data during previous accidental releases at SRS.

J	Landa, ER; Councell, TB				Landa, ER; Councell, TB			Uranium content and leachable fraction of fluorspars	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						uranium; naturally occurring radionuclides; geology; waste storage		Much attention in the radiological health community has recently focused on the management and regulation of naturally occurring radioactive materials. Although uranium-bearing minerals are present in a variety of fluorspar deposits, their potential consideration as naturally occurring radioactive materials has received only limited recognition. The uranium content of 28 samples of acid- and cryolite-grade (>97% CaF2) fluorspar from the National Defense Stockpile was found to range from 120 to 24,200 mu g kg(-1), with a mean of 2,145 mu g kg(-1). As a point of comparison, the average concentration of uranium in the upper crust of the earth is about 2,500 mu g kg(-1). Leachability of this uranium was assessed by means of the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP). The TCLP extractable fraction ranged from 1 to 98%, with a mean of 24% of the total uranium. The typically low concentrations of uranium seen in these materials probably reflects the removal of uranium-bearing mineral phases during the beneficiation of the crude fluorspar ore to achieve industrial specifications. Future NORM studies should examine crude fluorspar ores and flotation tailings.

J	Costello, RG; Emery, RJ; Pakala, RB; Charlton, MA				Costello, RG; Emery, RJ; Pakala, RB; Charlton, MA			Radioactive waste minimization implications of clinically-indicated exsanguination procedures	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						waste; low-level; waste management; radiation protection; blood	LARGE UNIVERSITY; COMPLEX	Exsanguination is a method of animal euthanasia approved for use in specific circumstances. Animals undergoing exsanguination are fully anesthetized, and the blood is removed resulting in hypovolemia. In situations where radioactive materials are used as part of a research protocol that remain predominantly suspended in the blood, the exsanguination procedure can result in a significant lowering of residual radioactivity content. This reduction can greatly affect the types of waste management and minimization options that can be subsequently applied. In this study, data were collected from 20 rabbits injected with approximately 29.6 MBq (0.8 mCi) of tritiated thymidine as part of a percutaneous transluminal carotid artery angioplasty study. Residual concentrations of radioactivity were consistently reduced by an average of 88%. The reduction was very significant in this instance, since the residual activities were below the established exemption limit of 1.85 kBq g(-1) (0.05 mu Ci g(-1)) for disposal of these wastes as non-radioactive. Although the exsanguination procedure can result in significant waste minimization opportunities in certain circumstances, this should not be the rationale for its use. Rather, the method of euthanasia should be based exclusively on sound animal care and use principles, and waste management strategies should then be made following that decision.

This hybrid system can facilitate the analysis of beta-emitter mixtures with very similar liquid scintillation pulse height distributions, such as H-3, Cr-51, and I-125. All that is required for the technique are sets of quench standards of the nuclides to be analyzed and calibration standards for the gamma-emitters. Detection limits for seven nuclides were estimated to be about 0.005 Bq mL(-1), which are sufficiently low compared with the values of authorized safety guidelines.

J	Taczanowski, S				Taczanowski, S			Evaluation of accelerator-driven subcritical systems for transmutations of nuclear waste	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH			English	Article						nuclear transmutations; waste; accelerator-driven subcritical systems		A critical discussion of an emerging nuclear technology - accelerator-driven subcritical systems (ADSS) for nuclear transmutations is the subject of this paper. Starting from a general background of world energy problems, the perspectives of nuclear power are discussed. On this basis it is concluded that, in response to the gradual exhaustion of fossil organic fuels, nuclear energy will play a major role provided a solution is found to various obstacles (insufficient safety - hazard of super prompt criticality and radioactive waste). The ADSS technology is considered, describing first the physical preconditionings of existing critical systems Versus subcritical ones. It is indicated that in the existing systems a desirable closing of the fuel cycle is hardly possible since the minor actinides (MA) (unavoidably produced in significant quantities) show properties that for safety reasons disqualify them as fuel for critical systems. In this context, the remoteness of subcritical systems from super prompt criticality is pointed out as a parameter responsible for the key difference between the above systems. A superiority of subcritical ones is shown by comparing their behaviour in the case of a rapid reactivity insertion, that brings no risk in these, in contrast to the fast critical ones, thus giving good grounds for the development of this technology. One of the most viable forms of application of ADSS is a symbiotic nuclear energy system, consisting of an accelerator-driven unit and a number of co-operating light water reactors (LWRs). Finally, the research problems and difficulties are mentioned. It is noted that any form of closed fuel cycle cannot avoid dealing with large quantities of radioactive materials (actinides included), and their consequent problems. Yet, it seems that a definitive elimination of actinides and the use of enormous released energy are worth this price. Summarising, the concept of accelerator-driven subcritical systems for nuclear transmutations significantly heightens the safety of nuclear power systems. Since this might facilitate social acceptance and deployment of nuclear energy, this technology is a most promising emerging option. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Materials and methods: Dry supercoiled plasmid DNA was irradiated with electrons of energies ranging from 0.1 to 1.5 keV and the results were compared with those obtained by gamma-irradiation of the same plasmid in solution. For electron irradiation, the plasmid was deposited on a gold substrate under a controlled atmosphere to minimize contamination of the DNA film. Electron bombardments were performed under ultra-high vacuum conditions (UHV 10(-9) torr). DNA damage was detected by gel electrophoresis followed by quantitation of the DNA bands by fluorescence or by hybridization with a radioactive probe. Results: Electrons with energies from 0.1 to 1.5 keV induced single, double and multiple double-strand breaks in supercoiled plasmid DNA. For equal doses, we observed a marked increase in the efficiency of induction of double- and multiple-strand breaks in supercoiled DNA as a function of electron energy. In contrast to gamma-irradiation, the formation of small DNA fragments by electrons did not seem to be related to the production of the linear form of the plasmid. Conclusions: Electrons within the energy range of the secondary electrons generated by high-energy ionizing radiation induce single, double and multiple double-strand breaks in DNA. Problems associated with low-energy electron irradiation experiments and dose calculations in thin films are also discussed.

J	Bonin, B; Colin, M; Dutfoy, A				Bonin, B; Colin, M; Dutfoy, A			Pressure building during the early stages of gas production in a radioactive waste repository	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							POROUS-MEDIA	In a radioactive waste repository, hydrogen may be produced by anoxic corrosion of the metallic components, and by water radiolysis. The design of deep geological repositories presently envisaged in many countries tends to inhibit the migration of every chemical species coming from the repository, by means of several concentric watertight barriers. This tightness, which is desirable for other reasons, might prevent hydrogen evacuation and cause a pressure rise in the near-field. Can this pressure break the barriers? In the first stage of the process, the hydrogen dissolves in the porewater. It is shown in the present paper that in the vicinity of a steel surface embedded in clay, the pressure rise due to the production of dissolved hydrogen may be large already (a few MPa), and may represent a significant fraction of the barrier resistance limit. In the second phase of the process, a gas bubble may form, causing a further pressure increase. The problem of gas production in geological repositories is treated here as a special case of thermo-hydro-chemico-mechanical coupling in a porous medium. The time needed for the bubble to form depends on the nature of the metal, and on the characteristics of the barrier. The purpose of this paper is to give orders of magnitude for the time and space scales associated with hydrogen production in the near-field of a deep repository, before the formation of a gaseous phase.

Analysis of the XRD pattern of pollucite with an absorbed dose of 10(18) beta decays/g using Rietveld analysis indicates a 8.5-1% volume expansion of the tetrahedral structure as measured at 50 It and a minor displacement of the Cs cation toward the face of one of the six-membered rings. Analysis of the real-space pair-distribution function obtained from Fourier transformation of the diffraction pattern indicates significant correlated movement of the (Si,Al)-O pairs and large static disorder between Cs-O pairs. Analysis of the Cs K-edge XAS revealed substantial contributions from the Cs atomic X-ray absorption. This likely results from the exceedingly long Cs-O bond distances in the pollucite structure, which diminish the fine structure of the XAS oscillations, and the destructive interference of the backscattered photoelectron from static disorder between Cs-O pairs. In addition, a significant lengthening of the Cs-Cs interatomic distance was observed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

For protium and deuterium the properties diffusivity (D), Sieverts' constant (K-s), permeability (Phi), trapping energy (E-t) and the trap sites concentration (N-t) are given. On the basis of ideal harmonic vibration of the hydrogen isotope atoms in a unique type of solution site, the values derived for the characteristic protium oscillation temperatures are: theta = 1884 K, theta(+) = 2387 K. These values lead to the following extrapolated tritium transport parameters: D (m(2)s(-1)) = 4.166 x 10(-8) exp (-12027/RT), K-s(mol m(-3) Pa-1/2) = 0.271 exp (-27 905/RT), Phi (mol m(-1) Pa-1/2 s(-1)) = 1.127 x 10(-8) exp(-39 933/RT), E-t (J/mol) = 55 554. and N-t (sites/m(3)) = 0.79 x 10(24). The dynamics of the hydrogen isotopes transport and the origin of the trapping phenomenon are discussed in connection with the OPTIFER-IVb microstructure. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The a-C:D lavers have been deposited from a CDS glow discharge plasma onto carbon and silicon substrates. The results for the absolute numbers obtained with the different analysing techniques show a scatter of up to about 35% around the average value. These deviations are larger than the errors stated by the experimentalists and indicate possible systematic uncertainties in some of the measurements. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Verrall, RA; Miller, JM; Gierszewski, P				Verrall, RA; Miller, JM; Gierszewski, P			Performance of a Li2TiO3 pebble-bed in the CRITIC-III irradiation	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article								Lithium metatitanate (Li2TiO3) is a candidate material for tritium breeding in fusion reactor pebble-bed blankets. 173 g of Li2TiO3 pebbles were irradiated for 334 full power days (FPD) to a burnup of 0.9% Li-6 in the CRITIC-III experiment in AECL's NRU reactor. A key objective was to determine tritium release over a wide temperature band from 200 degrees C to 900 degrees C, On-line release and temperature measurements are reported in this paper. New analytical methods led to calculated inventories ranging from 15 wppm average at the lowest temperature of operation (200 degrees C outer surface to 700 degrees C inner surface) to less than 1.2 wppm average at 375 degrees C outer-surface temperature and 875 degrees C inner-surface temperature. The thermocouples indicated that the bed remained stable during the irradiation, which included thermal shocks from 90 reactor shutdowns. From this swept-capsule irradiation, Li2TiO3 appears to be a good candidate for fusion blanket pebble-beds. Crown Copyright (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Risovany, VD; Varlashova, EE; Suslov, DN				Risovany, VD; Varlashova, EE; Suslov, DN			Dysprosium titanate as an absorber material for control rods	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Letter								Disprosium titanate is an attractive control rod material for the thermal neutron reactors. Its main advantages are: insignificant swelling. no out-gassing under neutron irradiation, rather high neutron efficiency, a high melting point (similar to 1870 degrees C), non-interaction with the cladding at temperatures above 1000 degrees C, simple fabrication and easily reprocessed non-radioactive waste. It can be used in control rods as pellets and powder. The disprosium titanate control rods have worked off in the MIR reactor for 17 years, in VVER-1000 - for 4 years without any operating problems. After postirradiation examinations this type of control rod having high lifetime was recommended for the VVER and RBMK. The paper presents the examination results of absorber element dummies containing dysprosium titanate, irradiated in the SM reactor to the neutron fluence of 3.4 x 10(22) cm(-1) (E > 0.1 MeV) and, also, the data on structure, thermal-physical properties of dysprosium titanate. efficiency of dysprosium titanate control rods.

This enables us to account for modifications of the local fuel chemistry, or to distinguish between the behaviour of different migrating species. In addition, we have assessed the influence of the trapping parameters on the precipitation rate according to different models from the open literature which have been extended in order to incorporate the variable intrinsic reaction rate. The interrelationships among the models have been established while their limitations and range of validity have been discussed. The results reveal that there is a critical value above which the influence of the intrinsic reaction rate, between a fission product and an intergranular trap, on the global precipitation rate becomes negligible.

J	Park, YS; Sohn, HY; Butt, DP				Park, YS; Sohn, HY; Butt, DP			Thermal removal of gallium from gallia-doped ceria	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							REDUCTION	The potential for removing gallium from Ga-doped CeO2-x by thermal means was studied for the purpose of assessing gallium removal from PuO2-x. The latter is of interest to those considering the storage or use of weapon-grade Pu, for example as a mixed oxide fuel component. Experiments were done by varying temperature, gas composition, exposure time, sample size, particle size, and gas flow rate. The kinetics of gallium removal were assessed through measurements of weight change, scanning electron microscopy, and chemical analyses. Results suggest that the gallium level can be reduced significantly by thermal treatments in Ar-6% H-2. Gallium species segregate to grain boundaries because of the low solubility of Ga2O3 in CeO2. The kinetics and microstructural observations suggest that both gaseous and solid-state diffusion of gallium species are important for the removal of gallium. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Pfeiffer, H; Sanchez-Sanchez, J; Alvarez, LJ				Pfeiffer, H; Sanchez-Sanchez, J; Alvarez, LJ			Lithium and tritium diffusion in lithium oxide (Li2O), a molecular dynamics simulation	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							CERAMIC BREEDER MATERIALS; SILICATES; BEHAVIOR	Molecular dynamics simulations of Li2O were performed in the microcanonical ensemble at several different temperatures in order to study the lithium diffusion process, and a preliminary exploration of the diffusion of tritium was performed. Different Li/O molar ratios were used to investigate the role of non-stoichiometry in the Li diffusion processes. The mechanism of lithium diffusion as a function of temperature is proposed based on the analysis of our simulations and a model is proposed to explain the overall behaviour of the lithium diffusion coefficient as a function of temperature. Our simulations suggest what is the role of hydrogen in the tritium release from breeder ceramic materials. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The starting materials were the corresponding metal nitrates and urea. In these preparations, the metal nitrates act as oxidizer and urea as fuel. Highly exothermic decomposition of the metal nitrate-urea complexes on heating at about 500 K leads to a combustion process yielding RE6UO12 fine powders. Thermal expansion measurements of these compounds were carried out in the temperature range of 298-1173 K by high temperature X-ray powder diffractometry. The observed axial thermal expansion behaviour is explained on the basis of the crystal chemistry of the compounds. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Another source of long-lived isotopes is the impurities in the steel. To examine this, three heats of reduced-activation martensitic steel were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for low-level impurities that compromise the reduced-activation characteristics: a 5-ton heat of modified F82H (F82H-Mod) for which an effort was made during production to reduce detrimental impurities, a 1-ton heat of JLF-1, and an 18-kg heat of ORNL 9Cr-2WVTa. Specimens from commercial heats of modified 9Cr-1Mo and Sandvik HT9 were also analyzed. The objective was to determine the difference in the impurity levels in the F82H-Mod and steels for which less effort was used to ensure purity. Silver, molybdenum, and niobium were found to be the tramp impurities of most importance. The F82H-Mod had the lowest levels, but in some cases the levels were not much different from the other heats. The impurity levels in the F82H-Mod produced with present technology did not achieve the low-activation limits for either shallow land burial or recycling. The results indicate the progress that has been made and what still must be done before the reduced-activation criteria can be achieved. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The parameters governing the kinetics and the steady-state of the reduction process to Li4SiO4-x were determined at 800 degrees C. The level x of the O-vacancy concentration at steady-state (of the order of 1.5 x 10(-3) mole fraction) was found to be compatible with the impurities content in the specimens. Pebble pre-annealing treatments were found to affect the microstructure and the reduction mechanism. Post-irradiation tritium release by TPD tests were performed on both stoichiometric and reduced pebbles with similar results. Tritium release properties of this breeder system seem to be independent from the material reduction state(x). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, the measured detector readings are combined with the diffusion theory with the Kalman filtering (DIKAL) method. The measured detector readings are transformed into the measured mesh flux through appropriate approximation. And, the difference between calculated and measured mesh flux is filtered out by Kalman filtering technique. Then, the measured mesh fluxes are used as an internal boundary condition in the diffusion equation. The performance of the DIE;AL method has been assessed for the various core states, and has been also applied tr, the calculation of power and Aux distribution calculation in the CANDU 6 reactor. Sensitivity studies have shown that DIKAL is quite stable to the detector random and systematic errors. Also, it is shown that the DIKAL approach is more accurate than the currently used flux synthesis approach in CANDU 6 reactors.

Preliminary cold experiments were conducted using cobalt oxide deposited on stainless steel plate. Fluorine atoms proved to be generated in high concentration in the plasma, which fluorinated the deposited metal oxide into volatile gaseous form. Upon plasma irradiation during about 200s, the cobalt oxide deposit was removed to 100% from plate surface. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations on CF4-O-2 systems containing cobalt served to elucidate the mechanism of metal oxide removal by microwave discharge plasma, and similar calculations on systems containing actinides (U, Pu etc.) and lanthanides (La, Gd etc.) indicated that the process should be applicable also to the removal of these radioactive elements. It is concluded from the experimental and calculated results that decontamination is basically feasible with the proposed method of using microwave discharge plasma in a CF4-O-2 system at atmospheric pressure.

Se-79 was measured after a seven step chemical treatment to remove interfering activity from Cs-137, Sr-90, and plutonium at levels 10(5) times higher than the observed Se-79 content and to remove Tc-99 at levels 300 times higher than observed Se-79. Se-79 was measured by liquid scintillation beta-decay counting after specific tests to eliminate uncertainties from possible contributions from Tc-99, Pm-147, Sm-151, Zr-93, or Pu-241 whose beta-decay spectra could appear similar to that of Se-79, and whose content would be expected at levels near or greater than 79Se.

The capacity of novel N3O2 azacrown ion exchanger was 0.21 meq/g dry resin. The heavier isotopes of magnesium concentrated in the resin phase, while the lighter isotopes are enriched in the solution phase. The glass ion exchange column used in our experiment was 30 cm long with inner diameter of 0.2 cm, and the 2.0M NH4Cl solution was used as an eluent. The separation factors of Mg-24-Mg-25, Mg-25-Mg-26 and Mg-24-Mg-26 were 1.030, 1.009, and 1.027, respectively.

J	Mietelski, JW; Gaca, P; Olech, MA				Mietelski, JW; Gaca, P; Olech, MA			Radioactive contamination of lichens and mosses collected in South Shetlands and Antarctic Peninsula	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							POLAND; RADIONUCLIDES; CHERNOBYL; SAMPLES	Samples belonging to two species of lichen and one of moss collected on the Antarctic seashore (King George Island, Deception, Antarctic Peninsula) were analysed for gamma-emitters using HPGe gamma-spectrometry, and for alpha-emitters using alpha-spectrometry with silicon detectors. Observed Cs-137 activities show large variations: from 4.1+/-0.4 to 74+/-3 Bq/kg. Total activity of Pb-210 changed from <2 to 125+/-35 Bq/kg. The Pu239+240 activity ranged from 0.07+/-0.02 to 2.95+/-0.16 Bq/kg. The activity of Pu-238 ranged from <0.02 to 0.64+/-0.04 Bq/kg. Maximum U-238 and U-234 activity was 7 Bq/kg, respectively and 0.3 Bq/kg for U-235, whereas minimum activities were below 0.5 Bq/kg for U-234 and U-238 and about 0.02 Bq/kg for U-235. The U-235 to U-238 activity ratio for most of the samples was natural. Thorium activities were about two times lower than those for uranium. The activities of Sm-147 ranged from 0.014+/-0.002 to 1.0+/-0.2 Bq/kg. One sample had relatively high activity of Am-241: 3.38+/-0.11 Bq/kg, another did not exceeded 1 Bq/kg. Observed activity ratios confirmed differences between mosses and lichen accumulation properties for radionuclides. Lichens are more selective for plutonium accumulation. Some radiocesium and probably also americium can be leached from them.

J	Singh, DK; Singh, H; Gupta, CK				Singh, DK; Singh, H; Gupta, CK			Extraction of uranium with 2-ethylhexyl phosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester (PC-88A)	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							SOLVENT-EXTRACTION; SEPARATION; COBALT; NICKEL	The extraction behavior of uranium (VI) from chloride medium with 2-ethylhexyl phosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester (PC-88A) in dodecane has been investigated under wide range of conditions. Attempts have been made to establish the extraction mechanism of uranium(VI) with PC-88A. Treatment of the distribution data by slope analysis technique showed the formation of a monomeric complex of the nature [UO2(A(2)H)(2)]. Formation of this species was also confirmed by non-linear least square regression of the distribution data to the mathematical expression correlating percentage extraction and acidity. In this investigation attempts have also been made to develop a mathematical model for the system (UO2Cl2-HCl-H2O-PC-88A-dodecane) using experimental data on the distribution of uranium against initial aqueous acidity at different initial metal concentration. The mathematical model D = 37.547+/-0.223/C(i)(1/2)x[H-i](2) can be used to predict the concentration of uranium in organic as well as in aqueous phases at any initial concentration of uranium [C-i] and initial hydrogen ion concentration [H-i]. The extraction constant (K-ex) has been calculated.

The activity coefficient equations comprise a Debye-Huckel term and a Margules expansion carried out to the four suffix level, where the higher order electrostatic contribution was neglected. The binary parameter was determined from the thermodynamic properties of the two relevant aqueous solutions. The three mixing parameters were obtained by correlating data for the partial pressure of nitric acid over HNO3-UO2(NO3)(2)-H2O solutions at 298.15 K. By using the mixing parameters, the activity coefficients of the ternary system can be calculated with good accuracy, and the solubility of uranyl nitrate in aqueous nitric acid with concentration up to 14 mol/kg can be satisfactorily predicted.

The distribution ratios follow the order: Pu(VI) > Pu(IV) > Am(III). The species extracted were identified to be [Pu . 2(18-C-6)1(SO4)(2), [PuO2.(18-C-6)]SO4 and [Am . 2(18-C-6)](SO4)(1.5) for Pu(IV) Pu(VI) and Am(III), respectively, The equilibrium constants (K) evaluated for the extraction reactions follow the order, K-Pu(iV) > K-Pu(IV) > K-Am(III) as expected in accordance with the axial charge experienced by the incoming ligand (18-C-6). The thermodynamic parameters evaluated at 298 K showed the reaction to be stabilized by the decrease in enthalpy and counteracted by the decrease in entropy in all the three cases. The large decrease in the enthalpy observed in all the cases showed that there is direct bonding of crown ether to the central metal atom (i.e., the formation of inner sphere complex).

DPSO, TBP, TOPO (mono-functional) and DBDECMP, DHDECMP, CMPO (bi-functional) with wide basicity range using benzene as diluent. A linear correlation was observed when the equilibrium constant log Ks for the organic phase synergistic reaction of both U(VI) and Pu(VT) with either of the chelating agents HTTA or HPMBP was plotted vs. the basicity (log Kh) of the donor (both mono- and bi-functional) indicating bi-functional donors also behave as monofunctional. This was supported by the thermodynamic data (Delta G degrees, Delta H degrees, Delta S degrees) obtained for these systems. The organic phase adduct formation reactions were identified for the above systems from the thermodynamic data. In the Am(III) HTTA system log K(s)values of bi-functional donors were found to be very high and deviate from the linear plot (log K-s vs. log K-h) Obtained for mono-functional donors, indicating that they function as bi-functional for the Am(III)/HTTA system studied. This was supported by high +ve Delta S degrees values obtained for this system.

Nuclear characteristics of the reactor core are analyzed by using SRAC95 ia standard reactor analysis code), with 30 group cross section data from JENDL3.2 (nuclear data file). Burn up characteristics of the reactor are estimated by using SRAC95 and ORIGEN2 (a code to calculate the build up and decay of radioactive materials), assuming that the fuel salt is reprocessed once in every 6 years, and graphite moderator are replaced in every 15 years. From the present study, the following results have been obtained. (1) Fuel conversion ratio of the reactor is about 0.92, and the reactor can be operated feeding only 8% fissile material of LWR case. (2) Build up of dissolvable fission products is low enough not to cause chemical problems or precipitation troubles, even after 40 years operation. (3) Regarding long-lived radioactive waste, this reactor produces only 10% minor actinides amount of LWR case.

When the situation of our country, which is not rich in energy resources, is taken into account, it seems that the importance of nuclear power generation will be heightened. Based on such a background, the basic policy for nuclear power generation is 'from light water reactors to fast breeder reactors'. However, considering that light water reactors have become common, the recent outlook for the supply and demand for uranium resources, development trends of fast breeder reactor technology, etc., the light water reactor is expected to remain dominant in our country until at least the second half of the 21st century. Therefore, five PWR utilities in Japan (Hokkaido, Kansai, Shikoku, Kyushu, and Japan Atomic Power), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd and Westinghouse Electric Corporation have jointly started researching the Next Generation PWR (N.G.P) which is expected to be the leading nuclear power plant, taking place of APWR ET. Magari, Development of Next Generation PWR in Japan, Proceedings of the 10th Pacific Basin Nuclear Conference, 1996; K. Fujimura, et al., Proceedings of the Second International Symposium on Global Environment and Nuclear Energy Systems, 1996]. In this program, construction is targeted to start from 2010 based on expected future environmental conditions. Now, the capacity of more than 1500 MWe class PWR concept is investigated and a plant concept which has innovative features of a hybrid safety systems, i.e. an optimum combination of active and passive safety systems, and horizontal steam generators for core cooling at the accidents is developed as a promising candidate. The plant concept and the results of the investigation are presented in this paper. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

J	Motoe, S				Motoe, S			Analysis of high burnup fuel behavior in Halden reactor by FEMAXI-V code	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								The author developed a code FEMAXI-V to analyze the behaviors of high burnup LWR fuels. FEMAXI-V succeeded the basic structure of code FEMAXI-IV, and incorporated such new models and functions as fuel thermal conductivity degradation with burnup, alliance with burnup analysis code which gives radial power profile and fast neutron flux, etc. In the present analysis, coolant conditions, detailed power histories and specifications of the fuel rods DH and DK of IFA-519.9 irradiated in Halden reactor were input, and calculated rod internal pressures were compared with experimental data for the range of similar to 25-93 MWd kg(-1) UO2, and factors affecting pellet temperature were discussed. Also some sensitivity studies were conducted with respect to the effect of swelling rate and grain growth. As a result, it is found that the prediction is sensitive to the models of thermal conductivity and swelling rate of fuel, and FEMAXI-V analytical system proved to give a reasonable prediction even in the high burnup region.

With Delta E&E-counter-telescope, proton peaks by the D(d,p)T and Li-6(d,p)Li-7 reactions were well resolved from continuous spectrum of alpha-particles by the Li-7(d,alpha + n)alpha reaction. The yields of these protons were obtained and densities of deuterium and lithium isotopes on the Ti surfaces were obtained. Isotopic ratio of lithium was determined by comparing the yield of Li-6(p,3He)alpha, Li-6(p,alpha) He-3 and Li-7(p,alpha)alpha reactions with proton beam bombardment. Deviation among the experimental values was about 9%. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
