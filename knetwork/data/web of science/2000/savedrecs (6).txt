The dependence of the normalized leaching rate on the temperature leads to an activation energy equal to about 42 +/- 3 kJ mol(-1). The normalized leaching rate is slightly increased when increasing the acidity or the basicity of the leachate. The partial orders related to proton and hydroxide ions are equal to 0.31-0.35 and 0.35, respectively. For the pH range studied, i.e., 1 < pH < 4 and 10 < pH < 13, the normalized dissolution rate is always lower than 10(-5) g m(-2) d(-1) which confirms the good retention properties of the TPD even in a very corrosive medium. The presence of phosphate ions in the solution slightly increases the normalized leaching rate, but this increase is significant only for concentration higher than 0.1 M. Simultaneously to these experiments, the TEM study showed the formation of an amorphous external thin layer on the TPD surface and small corrosion pits during the first days of leaching in 5 M HNO3. Several crystallized phases coexist inside the gel finally obtained after the rather complete dissolution of TPD. When the saturation of the solution is obtained, the neoformed phase was identified as the thorium phosphate-hydrogenphosphate hydrate whose solubility product is very small. In these conditions, the thorium and phosphate concentrations measured in the leachate are controlled by the precipitation of such a compound and remain lower than 10-5 M when the initial TPD is partly dissolved.

J	Inoue, M; Abe, K; Sato, I				Inoue, M; Abe, K; Sato, I			A method for determining an effective porosity correction factor for thermal conductivity in fast reactor uranium-plutonium oxide fuel pellets	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							UO2	A reliable method has been developed for determining an effective porosity correction factor for calculating a realistic thermal conductivity for fast reactor uranium-plutonium (mixed) oxide fuel pellets. By using image analysis of the ceramographs of transverse sections of mixed-oxide fuel pellets, the fuel morphology could be classified into two basic types. One is a 'two-phase' type that consists of small pores dispersed in the fuel matrix. The other is a 'three-phase' type that has large pores in addition to the small pores dispersed in the fuel matrix. The pore sizes are divided into two categories, large and small, at the 30 mu m area equivalent diameter. These classifications lead to an equation for calculating an effective porosity correction factor by accounting for the small and large pore volume fractions and coefficients. This new analytical method for determining the effective porosity correction factor for calculating the realistic thermal conductivity of mixed-oxide fuel was also experimentally confirmed for high-, medium- and low-density fuel pellets.

Nonisothermal experiments were carried out at various linear heating rates. Intermediates formed in each stage of the thermal decomposition of thorium oxalate hexahydrate were deduced. Kinetics of decomposition in each stage were evaluated from the dynamic TGA-DTA data by means of Coats and Redfern equation. The values of the activation energy (E) and the pre-exponential factor (A) of each stage of the thermal decomposition at various linear heating rates were calculated. These kinetic parameters were evaluated from isothermal experiments also and probable decomposition mechanism is proposed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Spino, J; Papaioannou, D				Spino, J; Papaioannou, D			Lattice parameter changes associated with the rim-structure formation in high burn-up UO2 fuels by micro X-ray diffraction	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							MICROSTRUCTURAL CHANGE; FISSION-PRODUCTS; ELECTRON-MICROSCOPY; GRAIN SUBDIVISION; OXYGEN POTENTIALS; SINGLE-CRYSTALS; NUCLEAR-FUEL; OXIDE FUELS; GAS-RELEASE; DEFECTS	Radial variations of the lattice parameter and peak width of two high burn-up UO2-fuels (67 and 80 GWd/tM) were measured by a specially developed micro-X-ray diffraction technique, allowing spectra acquisition with 30 mu m spatial resolution. The results showed a significant but constant peak broadening, and a lattice parameter that increased towards the pellet edge and decreased again within the rim-zone. This lattice contraction coincided with other property changes in the rim region, i.e., porosity increase, hardness decrease and Xe depletion. In terms of local burn-ups, the lattice contraction followed the rate of the matrix Xe depletion measured by EMPA, exceeding greatly the contraction rate due to dissolved fission products. The observed behaviour can be equally explained by a saturation of single interstitials with subsequent recombination with excess vacancies, as by the saturation and enlargement of dislocation loops. The concentration and sizes of defects involved and their possible relation to the rim structure formation are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The pyrolytic carbon and silicon were deposited by thermal decomposition of propane at 1250 degrees C in a chemical vapor deposition unit and microwave pulsed electron cyclotron resonance plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (ECR PECVD) using silane at 500 degrees C. Microstructural observation of the layers with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that an inner layer existed following the surface contour of the pellet and the outer layer had a small number of fine pores inside. Chemical analyses with Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD) revealed that the inner and outer layers were pyrolytic carbon and silicon carbide, respectively. From the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation, the silicon carbide formed during the combustion reaction was identified as fine crystalline beta-SiC. The temperature distribution of the specimen during the combustion reaction was estimated by a finite element method, which showed that preheating above 1300 degrees C was required for the combustion reaction between silicon and carbon to propagate well through the specimen.

J	Arkush, R; Mintz, MH; Shamir, N				Arkush, R; Mintz, MH; Shamir, N			Passivation of uranium towards air corrosion by N-2(+) and C+ ion implantation	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							WATER-VAPOR; OXIDATION; TEMPERATURES; SURFACES; METALS	The passivation of uranium surfaces against air corrosion, by ion implantation processes was studied, using surface analysis methods. Implanting 45 keV N-2(+) and C+ ions produces thin modified surface layers with gradual gradients of the corresponding compounds (i.e., nitrides and carbides, respectively), which avoid the formation of discontinuous interfaces typical to coatings. Such gradual interfaces impart excellent mechanical stability and adhesion to the modified layers, in spite of the large misfit between the metal substrate and the implantation on induced compounds. It turns out that these layers provide an almost absolute protection against air corrosion. A rapid initial stage of oxidation of the modified surface layers takes place, forming very thin protective oxidation zones (1-4 nm thick), which practically stop further air oxidation for years. The mechanism of the initial oxidation stage of the modified layers seems to vary with the type of surface (i.e., either nitrides or carbides). However, in any case the protection ability of the formed oxidation products is excellent, probably due to the close match between these compounds and the underlying nitrides or carbides.

J	Yoo, HS; Lee, SY; Lee, SJ; Song, KW				Yoo, HS; Lee, SY; Lee, SJ; Song, KW			Effect of AlOOH on the microstructure of UO2 pellets	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article								A mechanism of reducing the open porosity and coarsening the grain size of UO2 by the addition of AlOOH has been investigated. X-ray diffraction experiments showed that oxygen atoms released by the dissociation of AlOOH during sintering moved into the UO2 matrix, resulting in the transformation of UO2 to U4O9 at high concentrations of AlOOH. The excess oxygen atoms raised the grain size due to the increase of uranium vacancies through Schottky equilibrium. It is suggested that the Al-containing components produced by AlOOH dissociation were located at the grain boundaries with small pores. The presence of the Al-containing components at the grain boundaries hampered the movement of pores and led to the decrease of open porosity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

From the Fe vapor pressure data at known compositions (x(Fe)), Henry's coefficient (K-Fe = p(Fe)/x(Fe)) of the solute was obtained as log K-Fe (+/-0.07) (Pa) = -18975.6(+/-1098.1)/T + 11.15(+/-0.44). The behavior of K-Fe(T) is shown to be marginally different from that of the equilibrium vapor pressures of pure liquid iron (p(Fe)degrees) The partial molar excess Gibbs energy of iron at infinite dilution derived from the behavior is expressed as Delta(E)(G) over bar(Fe)(infinity) = -1588+ 1.25T (J mol(-1)). The result is discussed in the light of the quasi-regular solution model and compared with data of the system available in the literature. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Only two factors affecting hydriding rate were found: temperature (and time) of the final heat treatment, and silicon content. Increasing the time and temperature of alpha-phase anneals increased the reaction rate, and annealing in the beta-phase greatly increased the reaction rate over alpha-phase annealing.

The code incorporates hypotheses concerning glass alteration in aqueous media based on the first-order kinetic law for total silicon with variable silicon retention in the gel and silicon diffusion in the gel interstitial water, coupled with silicon adsorption and diffusion in the materials in contact with the glass. The canister CP are considered as a localized medium with a mass adsorption capacity R-ad, while the EM are considered as a porous medium with a diffusion coefficient D-p and a distribution coefficient K-d. LIXIVER 2 simulates these media in one-dimensional Cartesian geometry. The K-d values determined by simulating alteration tests logically increase with the aggressiveness of the materials with respect to the glass. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The applicability to Pu burner cores of models developed for breeder reactors was examined. The high flexibility of a fast reactor core for Pu burning was demonstrated by an optimization study to show the feasibility of using a single reactor design with Pu vectors varying from highly enriched (military) Pu to degraded Pu produced by multiple recycling. With fuel limited to MOX (similar to 45% Pu) and a single sub-assembly geometry for all grades of Pu, effective compensation for changes in Pu vector was achieved by replacing fuel with diluent material. The most suitable diluent had two components-absorber ((B4C)-B-10) and a moderator or neutron-transparent material (ZrH was most effective)-this gave an additional degree of freedom for optimizing safety-related core parameters. Where pin power ratings were high, hollow pellets introducing void as diluent were effective. Calculations demonstrated a possibility of flux distortions and anomalous rating distributions; these were a consequence of significant moderation of the flux in combination with the interaction between the core and the above/below core structures in the absence of breeder blankets.

Their transmutation has been of high priority to reduce the long-term consequences of nuclear energy generation. So far little attention was given to radioactive Zr-93, but its hazard appears to be rather substantial. The importance of Zr-93 transmutation is emphasized in the present paper. It is demonstrated that the fusion driven neutron source with high-flux blanket can be applied to transmute Zr-93 sufficiently and resolve the problem of its accumulation within the time period of several decades.

J	Huang, J; Tsuchiya, B; Konashi, K; Yamawaki, M				Huang, J; Tsuchiya, B; Konashi, K; Yamawaki, M			Estimation of hydrogen redistribution in zirconium hydride under temperature gradient	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						hydrogen; zirconium hydrides; zirconium alloys; diffusion; kinetics; temperature gradients; radiation effects; temperature dependence		To evaluate irradiation behavior of delta -ZrHx+U fuel, thermal migration of hydrogen under temperature gradient has been estimated according to traditional diffusion theory. Hydrogen profiles at steady state and diffusion kinetics in single-phase delta -ZrHx have been calculated for a cylinder specimen. When a temperature gradient is imposed on the initial uniform ZrH1.6 hydride, considerable thermal migration from the higher temperature center region to the pellet surface can be expected. Larger temperature gradient and lower temperature will cause greater inclination of the hydrogen distribution. The hydrogen transportation process in single-phase delta -ZrHx as a function of time was simulated by a finite difference method. In the case of two-phase delta -ZrHx+45 wt%U, the uranium phase tends to slow down the thermal migration rate of hydrogen by about 50% compared with that in single phase delta -ZrHx though it may have little influence on the final hydrogen distribution in the delta -ZrHx matrix. For the cylinder specimen under the temperature conditions of interest, the steady state would be reached at an early stage of the typical irradiation cycle. Finally, the engineering impact due to the redistribution was discussed.

In order to investigate above diversities, we have studied on the calculation method to be used in the estimation of spent fuel compositions and adopted the real irradiation calculation in which axial burnup and moderator distribution are considered in the burnup calculation. On the basis of the calculations, compositions and burnup quantities of various LWR spent fuels (reactor type: PWR and BWR, discharged burnup: 33, 45 and 60 GWd/tHM, fuel type : UO2 and MOX) are apparently estimated among various forms of fuels. As an example, it is shown that there are considerable discrepancy in MA burnup between PWR and BWR spent fuels.

Quartz, feldspar, chlorite, calcite, dolomite, mica, kaolinite, hematite and magnetite were identified as constituent minerals in the sediment samples. The phase composition and the iron distribution among the crystallographic sites of iron-bearing minerals (silicates, magnetite and hematite) of samples from different location have been derived from the complex Mossbauer spectra At different locations sediments had significant characteristic differences in the mineral composition, in the iron distribution among the crystallographic site of silicates, and in the specific radioactivity of Cs radionuclides. These results indicate differences in the rock formation and alteration by the sediments in this maritime part of Antarctica. There is a much higher amount of iron oxides in the sediments from south part of the geological fault across the Admiralty Bay than in the north part. This can be associated with much more alteration in the rocks in the south part compared to the northern one. This finding can contribute to the question of the history of the formation and alteration of volcanic rocks in the border of Antarctica.

Natural gamma-isotopes (K-40, U-238 and Th-232 series) antropogenic (Cs-134 and (CS)-C-137) and alpha-isotopes Pu-238 and (PU)-P-239,240 were measured. The different kind of bed rock and terrain configuration, influenced the radionuclide transportation from the soil to river bottom sediments. Radioactivity of the sediment samples is definitely lower than the soils. Very strong adsorption of isotopes in soil hinders their horizontal migration.

The dependence of extraction distribution on the concentrations of aqueous nitric acid and OPPD and also the temperature has been studied. The experimental results showed that the decreasing order of extraction ability of OPPD is as follows: benzene, dimethyl benzene (DMB), toluene, 1,2-dichloroethene, n-octane, carbon tetrachloride, cyclohexane, chloroform. It cannot be interpreted only on the basis of polarity of the diluents. The interaction between extractant or extracted species and diluent is discussed.

In this paper, the distribution and the variation of natural radionuclides (potassium, uranium and thorium) concentrations were described, because the natural radiation dose rates were reported in the former paper. In this survey, all concentrations of potassium, uranium and thorium were highest in Gifu Prefecture, followed by Mie Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, and the variation of radionuclide concentration due to region was observed. And, from the correlation analysis between concentration of natural radionuclides and absorbed dose rates in air due to gamma -ray, it was shown that potassium and thorium have greatly contributed to dose rates in air, and among concentrations of potassium, uranium and thorium, strong correlation was shown between potassium and thorium. Lastly, we showed results of correlation analysis between terrestrial gamma -ray dose rates obtained from this survey and annual mean radon concentration obtained by other researchers.

J	Ueda, Y				Ueda, Y			Effect of entrainment and overflow occurrence on concentration profile in uranium-strip bank of PUREX flowsheet	JOURNAL OF THE ATOMIC ENERGY SOCIETY OF JAPAN			Japanese	Article						PUREX process; solvent extraction; uranium strip; entrainment; overflow; concentration profile; simulation; calculation code; leakage flow		An occurrence of entrainment and overflow (a leakage flow through the overflow-passageway) should be considered in the operation of the solvent extraction process and design of an extractor because they affect the concentration profile. A computer code permitting the calculation of the concentration profile under an occurrence of such abnormal flows has been developed for the PUREX flowsheet. The concentration profile is calculated by solving overall mass balance equations considering those from abnormal flows. The effect of internal abnormal flows on the concentration profile was studied for the uranium-strip bank. The results showed that the internal abnormal flows disturbed the uranium stripping i,e. increased the uranium concentration in the solvent outflow, but the increase was far smaller than that caused by the deviation of feed flowrate into the bank due to its usual control precision which is considered in an industrial flowsheet. An occurrence of entrainment and overflow has been restricted severely because there has been no quantitative study about its effect on the concentration profile, however, the results suggested the possibility of relaxing that restriction, which provides a more flexible operation of process for disturbance and a smaller design load of a solvent extractor for the uranium-strip bank.

This ever-expanding Union is now extending membership to the so-called applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe, but before full membership is attained, certain economic, environmental and nuclear safety requirements have to be met. Against this background, the Environment Directorate General of the European Commission, in 1998, asked for an existing study they had commissioned on radioactive waste management financing schemes to be extended to cover the applicant countries. The purpose of this paper is to present some of its findings, and compare more established financing schemes with those of the applicant countries. The aim is to show how the applicant countries are working towards achieving their commitment to responsible radioactive waste management.

The castle, a sixteenth century L-shaped plan structure, has archaeological significance and therefore has been given scheduled monument status. As a result of past operations, the environs around the castle became affected by radioactive contamination. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority developed an action plan to address the problem. Initially, this involved characterization of the contamination followed by an options study. From this a preferred option, target remediation based on the 'as low as reasonably practicable' (ALARP) principle, was designed and subsequently implemented by an excavation and replacement technique. This was coupled with remote archaeological monitoring and recording, a requirement of scheduled monument consent. The target remediation based on ALARP, involving the excavation, segregation and waste sentencing of 2017 m(3) of soil, has allowed access to the area to be re-established. The risk posed by residual contamination has been estimated at a maximum of 2.7 x 10(-6) y-(1) to a possible future resident. This level of risk is in line with current Government and advisory body risk targets. In addition, the concurrent archaeological monitoring exercise successfully established five historical periods.

J	Mason, JB; Bradbury, D				Mason, JB; Bradbury, D			Pyrolysis and its potential use in nuclear graphite disposal	NUCLEAR ENERGY-JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH NUCLEAR ENERGY SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	BNES Seminar on Nuclear Graphite Disposal	OCT 18-20, 1999	MANCHESTER, ENGLAND	BNES		graphite; pyrolysis; steam-reforming		Graphite is used as a moderator material in a number of nuclear reactor designs, such as Magnox and advanced gas-cooled reactors in the United Kingdom and the RBMK design in Russia. During construction, the moderator of the reactor is usually installed as an interlocking structure of graphite bricks. At the end of reactor life, the graphite moderator, weighing typically 2000 t, is a radioactive waste which requires eventual management. Radioactive graphite disposal options conventionally include (a) in situ 'safe-store' for extended periods to permit manual disassembly of the graphite moderator through decay of short-lived radionuclides (b) robotic or manual disassembly of the reactor core followed by disposal of the graphite blocks (c) robotic or manual disassembly of the reactor core followed by incineration of the graphite and release of the resulting carbon dioxide. Studsvik, Inc. is a nuclear waste management and waste processing company organized to serve US nuclear utility and government facilities. Studsvik's management and technical staff have a wealth of experience in processing liquid, slurry and solid low-level radioactive waste using (among others) pyrolysis and steam reforming techniques. Bradtec is a UK company specializing in decontamination and waste management. This paper describes the use of pyrolysis and steam reforming techniques to gasify graphite leading to a low-volume off-gas product. This allows the following options/advantages. (a) Safe release of any stored Wigner energy in the graphite. (b) The process can accept small pieces or a water-slurry of graphite, which enables the graphite to be removed from the reactor core by mechanical machining or water-cutting techniques, applied remotely in the reactor-fuel channels. (c) In certain situations the process could be used to gasify the reactor moderator in situ. (d) The low volume of the off-gas product enables non-carbon radioactive impurities to be efficiently separated from the off-gas. (e) The off-gas product can be discharged to atmosphere if permitted, or can be absorbed and converted to a low-activity carbonate solid product, which can be used as infill around other radioactive waste.

Depending on the chemical composition of the graphite, numerous activation products may result. In addition, the amount of fission product contamination will depend on the location of the graphite. The migration of fission products may be supported by the high temperatures which occur in high-temperature reactors. At the Julich 15 MWe high-temperature gas-cooled experimental AVR (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Versuchsreaktor) reactor, two different types of nuclear graphite had been in use. High-purity graphite was used as a basic material for cove structures of the AVR. Insulation layers of carbon bricks (graphite with larger amounts of impurities) surrounding the graphite reflector were used to protect the metallic structures from high temperatures. For various reasons it is important to know the degree of contamination of graphite and carbon bricks from activation and fission products. The optimum method for nuclear graphite analysis in decommissioning is by incineration. Volatile activities ((14)C, (3)H, (36)Cl,...) have to be captured for analysis. In cases where dust-like samples are handled the incineration furnace has to be small enough to be operated in a glove-box. The resulting ashes can be used for determining all nonvolatile nuclides by different radiochemical methods. In early 1999, some graphite and carbon brick samples from the AVR reactor were obtained by drilling. The samples were then analysed in the laboratories at the Julich research centre, For incineration a vertical quartz tube Mas used which dips at the bottom into a small electric furnace. Tritium, (14)C and (36)Cl were captured in washing bottles. After further preparation, they were analysed by liquid scintillation counting (LSC). After dissolving the ashes, the elements were separated by ion exchange, extraction methods and HPLC. The radionuclides were then determined by alpha-spectrometry, LSC, low-level gamma-spectrometry and X-ray spectrometry.

The different expert appraisals showed that this had no consequences for the health of the public or of workers. Aiming at the resumption of transport, EDF and Cogema presented to the safety authority a plan of action including an increase in monitoring (number of points and cross-checking by SGS Qualitest), move widespread observance of good practices resulting from analyses by EDF and conclusions of its nuclear inspectorate, and an improvement in radiological cleanliness in the area where casks were loaded During the inspections carried out at EDF plants, the NISD verified the application of this plan. Several observations were, nevertheless, made regarding maintenance of equipment, failure to apply procedures on a corporate level and the traceability of certain operations. The measures taken to sufficiently inform the public were applied. The NISD is continuing its monitoring actions to ensure that all EDF plants adopt best practices. However, the overall clean-up of EDF plans is a long-term operation. Finally, the NISD is continuing its monitoring of the different stages of spent fuel transport as well as other types of transport of radioactive materials associated with nuclear activities.

J	Losonen, P				Losonen, P			Calculation method for diffusional gas release with grain boundary resolution	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							FUEL; UO2	The problem of diffusional release of stable fission gas atoms in nuclear fuel including grain boundary resolution is described. A numerical method for solving the set of resulting non-linear differential equations in time varying conditions is presented. The method is an extension to the locally accurate method (LOAM) published earlier. The extended LOAM accounts for the kinetic evolution of the gas content in the grain boundary. The fission gas release and the time to reach the saturation concentration at the grain boundaries by the extended method are compared to analytical solutions under steady state conditions. The results of this comparison show the excellent capability of the extended LOAM. The performance of the extended method in time varying conditions is tested by calculating the fission gas release for hundreds of complicated temperature-power histories. The extended LOAM is found to be able to calculate the fission gas release with +/- 1% accuracy in time varying conditions by using only three equal volume nodes. The computing time of the extended LOAM is less than twice the time needed by the LOAM without grain boundary resolution. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

I: Waste package degradation	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							CORROSION; DISPOSAL; LAYERS; IRON	A description is presented of the various models (i.e. thermal, chemical environment, humid-air and aqueous corrosion) used in the engineered barrier system performance assessment code (EBSPAC) to represent processes that govern the failure of waste packages (WPs) and, ultimately, the release of radionuclides from the engineered barrier system (EBS). These models are specifically adapted to the US Department of Energy (DOE) WP design, adopted in 1996, for the proposed repository at Yucca Mountain (YM), NV. The design consists of a double-wall overpack composed of two concentric containers of different metallic materials in a horizontal drift emplacement. EBSPAC was developed to deterministically evaluate the performance of the engineered barriers and to be used as the source term module incorporated in the Center for Nuclear Waste Regulatory Analyses (CNWRA)/Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) total performance assessment (TPA) code. EBSPAC essentially consists of two separate codes. The code dealing with WP failure calculations is the focus of this paper and the other, dealing with radionuclide release, is described in a companion paper. An example problem is presented to illustrate the results obtained with the code analyzing the influence of several critical input parameters, related to the repository and EBS designs and the resulting environmental conditions, on WP failure.

These models are specifically adapted to the US Department of Energy (DOE) WP design, adopted in 1996, for the proposed high-level radioactive waste (HLW) repository at Yucca Mountain (YM). The design consists of a double-wall overpack composed of two concentric containers of different metallic materials in a horizontal drift emplacement. EBSPAC was developed to deterministically evaluate the performance of the engineered barriers and to be used as the source term module in the Center for Nuclear Waste Regulatory Analyses (CNWRA)/Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Total-system Performance Assessment (TPA) code. EBSPAC has two distinct parts. The part dealing with the radionuclide release subsequent to WP failure is the focus of this paper in which various models (i.e. dry-air oxidation and aqueous dissolution of spent fuel (SF), gaseous and aqueous release of radionuclides) are presented, whereas modeling of the WP failure is described in a companion paper. An example problem is presented to illustrate computational results obtained with the code analyzing the influence of several critical input parameters for the source term related to the repository and EBS designs and resulting environmental conditions. The source term calculations are confined to the radionuclides being released just outside of the WP. Both gaseous and aqueous release calculations are performed using models in which radionuclide decay, in-growth of daughter products in the chains, degradation process of SF, temporal variation of inventory in the WP, and spatial variations in the properties of the surrounding material are included. The degree of complexity varies from model to model as necessary simplifications are made, while ensuring conservatism. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

J	Gat, U; Engel, JR				Gat, U; Engel, JR			Non-proliferation attributes of molten salt reactors	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								Molten salt reactors (MSR) have many non-proliferation attributes. They can operate on the thorium-uranium fuel cycle which protects the fissile material by the daughter products of the inseparable U-232. MSRs can completely fission all plutonium and HEU, and as desired, 'convert' them to U-233. This also results in high, and efficient resource utilization, while diminishing the plutonium stock. (On Pine processing, when applied, could free the waste from all fissile material. The fuel in the reactor stays protected by the intense radiation of the fission products. Fuel can also be protected in the reactor as well as outside the reactor by denaturing with natural uranium. A wide variety of MSRs are available, from 'once through' minimum processing reactors to ones with fuel processing which can breed fuel for converters. MSRs are extremely safe and simple reactors with good economic potential. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

The current activities are focused on environmental and cosmological applications. One of the projects has been the study of the global fallout of the radioisotope Cl-36 and its latitudinal distribution in the southern hemisphere. We have also undertaken some of the preparatory work to measure the concentration of several radioisotopes in extraterrestrial samples obtained from a meteorite fall in northern Argentina. An important fraction of our effort in pursuing these studies has been the optimization of the technique in our 20 UD tandem. We discuss the results of recent tests carried out to evaluate the current capabilities of the accelerator regarding general stability, predictability and transmission efficiency, following the upgrading and adaptation activities.

The AMS system is based on an upgraded FN (7 MV) tandem accelerator that has recently been modified to improve performance. The precision is 1% for C-14 and it is 3-5% for the other nuclides for radioisotope/stable isotope ratios at the 10(-12) levels. System background for Be-10, C-14, Al-26, Cl-36 and Ca-41 is 1-10 x 10(-15) while for I-129 the natural abundance limits it to 20 x 10(-15) Research is being carried out in Earth, planetary, and biomedical sciences. Geoscience applications include determination of exposure ages of glacial moraines, volcanic eruptions, river terraces, and fault scarps. Burial histories of sand are being determined to decipher the timing of human expansion and climatic history. Environmental applications are tracing the release of radioactivity from nuclear fuel reprocessing plants, water tracing, and neutron dosimetry. The applications using meteoric nuclides are oil field brines, sediment subduction, radiocarbon dating, and groundwater Cl-36 mapping. Radionuclide concentrations are also determined in meteorites and tektites for deciphering space and terrestrial exposure histories. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Significant new developments include the ultra-sensitive detection of Tc-99, U-236 and the long-lived plutonium isotopes by AMS, and the demonstration that high-precision, low-background C-14 dating can be performed with accelerating voltages as low as 0.5 MV. In addition, the steady evolution of technique and hardware for C-14 AMS has resulted in substantial improvements in precision, throughput and background. Increases in throughput are also having an impact in other areas of application, most notably in ice-core research and exposure-age dating. The issue of the calibration of production rates of Be-10, Al-26 and Cl-36 by cosmic rays at the earth's surface, which is crucial to the effective application of exposure-age dating, has received some attention, and progress has been made towards a consensus.

Production of these nuclides requires nuclear reactions in which at least one of the partners is radioactive and is often short-lived. A sustained effort is presently made throughout the nuclear physics community to develop radioactive-ion beams (RIBs) of these species. The accompanying experimental challenges, their solutions and often the physics studied have deep analogies with accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). While RIBs are expected to have intensities far greater than the typical rare isotope beams of AMS, isobaric purity for example remains there a major concern. Techniques now familiar to AMS based on, for example, dE/dx, range, ionic charge state, gas-filled magnets are similarly applied.

Apart from providing nearly complete isobaric suppression and high overall efficiency, the possibility for combining optical isotopic selectivity with that of the mass spectrometer leads to remarkable specifications. The widespread analytical potential and applicability of different techniques based on resonant laser ionization is demonstrated in investigations on stable and radioactive ultratrace isotopes with the focus on applications which require high selectivity, concerning, e.g., the noble gas isotopes Kr-81,Kr-85, PU isotopes, Sr-89,Sr-90, Tc-99 and Ca-41. Selective ultratrace determination of these radioisotopes provides access to a variety of fundamental research problems in environmental sciences, geo- and cosmochemistry, archaeology and biomedicine, which previously were often an exclusive domain for accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

For biological research, 3H is generally quantified by liquid scintillation counting requiring gram-sized samples and counting times of several hours. For environmental research, H-3 is usually quantified by He-3 in-growth which requires gram-sized samples and in-growth times of several months. In contrast, provisional studies at LLNL's Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry have demonstrated that accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) can be used to quantify 3H in milligram-sized biological samples with a 100 to 1000-fold improvement in detection limits when compared to scintillation counting. This increased sensitivity is expected to have great impact on the biological and environmental research community. However, in order to make the 3H AMS technique more broadly accessible, smaller, simpler, and less expensive AMS instrumentation must be developed. To meet this need, a compact, relatively low cost prototype 3H AMS system has been designed and built based on an LLNL ion source/sample changer and an AccSys Technology radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) linac. With the prototype system, H-3/H-1 ratios ranging from 1 x 10(-10) to 1 x 10(-13) have be measured from milligram-sized samples. With improvements in system operation and sample preparation methodology, the sensitivity limit of the system is expected to increase to approximately 1 x 10(-15). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Measurement of this naturally occurring radioisotope is difficult due to the low level of production of the radioisotope and the ubiquitous nature of the stable isobaric interference, S-32. The isobar suppression was enacted using a new chemical separation and the differential energy loss profile of the Si-32 and S-32 ions after their transmission through a thin carbon foil. Determination of the energy loss and energy straggle profiles of the transmitted ion beam were made and compared to the predictions made using TRIM code. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

It has a high potential for migration in the environment as the pertechnetate anion. At the Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry, methods are being developed for the detection of this radionuclide by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), including extraction from environmental samples, concentration and purification of the Tc-99, conversion to a form appropriate for AMS analysis, and quantification by AMS. Besides interference from the stable (though relatively rare) atomic isobar Ru-99, the detection of Tc-99 by AMS presents some technical challenges which are not present for the other radionuclides typically measured by AMS. These challenges are related to the lack of a stable Tc isotope. Here we present the status of our Tc-99 methods including discussion of interferences and sensitivity, and recent results for environmental samples and the IAEA reference material IAEA-381, Irish Sea Water. Sensitivity is presently similar to 10 mu Bq (similar to 1 x 10(8) atoms) per sample, limited primarily by 99Ru introduced from process chemicals, and precision/reproducibility is similar to 15-25%.

A large analyzing magnet has been installed, able to bend even the heavy transuranic ions at the high energies achievable with our MP tandem. The final detector is a time-of-flight and a multiple energy loss measurement which allows a nearly background-free detection of individual actinides like Pu-244. A, efficient chemical preparation method has been developed for the extraction of small amounts of plutonium from samples up to nearly 1 kg. Furthermore, the preparation of sputter cathodes, containing the final sample material, was optimized for high yields of negative molecules in the Cs-sputter ion source. The first search for supernova-originated Pu-244 in a deep sea ferromanganese crust has already been carried out. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Although levels in the Southern Hemisphere are significantly below those in the Northern Hemisphere, they are still two orders of magnitude above natural levels. The most likely sources for anthropogenic I-129 are releases from reprocessing plants located in the Northern Hemisphere. The results indicate a rapid redistribution of this radioisotope through atmospheric transport on a global scale. Mid-latitudes in both hemispheres have higher values than equatorial and polar regions, probably reflecting atmospheric transport and precipitation patterns. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

We report on the development of the experimental setup and on preliminary measurements of U-236 in minerals and uranium standards. The isotopic abundance sensitivity is 1 x 10(-11). The natural U-236 abundance of five U-rich minerals were measured to be between 1 and 33 x 10(-11). U-236 is expected to be produced in situ by neutron capture on U-235. Three uranium standards material were measured and showed a large U-236 contamination. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The groundwaters were classified into three groups according to residence time, based on the H-3 concentration: (1) modern water recharged from the surface within the last 40 years, (2) a mixture between modern water and relatively old groundwaters, and (3) relatively old groundwater which is devoid of H-3. An attempt was made to date the H-3-free groundwater using C-14. Th, relative groundwater age estimated by simple model, which assumes no addition of dead carbon ranges from 6500 to 14,000 years B.P. The calcite precipitations on the fracture surface are also classified into three groups, based on carbon isotope compositions: (1) precipitation from groundwater within the last 50,000 years, (2) precipitation from the solution with different delta C-13 values from groundwater in the past more than 50,000 years, and (3) mixture of new calcite partly precipitated within the last 50,000 years and relatively old calcite. These data suggest the possibility that the conductive (open) fractures connected to the surface can be estimated by C-14 determination in the calcite on fracture surfaces.
