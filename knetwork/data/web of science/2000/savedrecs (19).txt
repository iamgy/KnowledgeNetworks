J	Singh, NP; Bertelli, L				Singh, NP; Bertelli, L			Limitations of tissue analyses in estimating the initial exposures to the workers for thorium, uranium and plutonium and their internal dose estimates	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Low-Level Measurements of Actinides and Long-Lived Radionuclides in Biological and Environmental Samples	SEP 21-25, 1998	SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH	US DOE, Carlsbad Area Off, Oxford Instruments Inc, Envirocare, Westinghouse WIPP, Eichrom Ind Inc				The present paper deals with the following questions: Can a piece of any tissue or organ obtained at autopsies and/or biopsies be analyzed to predict the organ and/or body burden, initial exposures, and the committed dose equivalents to the workers or retired workers from exposures to thorium, uranium, and plutonium and what are the consequences of using such materials in predicting the initial exposures and the dose estimates? Based on the studies of the distribution of uranium and thorium in former uranium miners and millers, the distribution of plutonium in general population, and several other studies dealing with the distribution of actinides in man, it is reasonable to state that the utilization of tissue analyses for estimating the initial exposure to the workers may have serious limitations. The regulatory agencies must restrict the conditional utilization of tissue analyses in estimating exposures to the workers for thorium, uranium, and plutonium.

Soil samples were subjected to selective sequential fractionation procedures to determine Am-241 association with the soluble, exchangeable, carbonate, organic, sesquioxide and silicate fractions. The highest percentage of Am-241 was found to be associated with the sesquioxide (hydrous oxide) fraction (39-47%), with lesser amounts in the soluble (14-17%), exchangeable (4-9%), carbonates (4-17%), organic (3-13%), and silicate (10-21%) soil fractions. Differences between americium and plutonium association with various soil fractions were observed.

This air monitoring location is a couple of meters north of a dirt road used to access the easternmost part of Area G. Air concentrations of (PU)-P-238 were essentially unaffected, which was puzzling because both Pu-238 and Pu-239 are present in the local. slightly contaminated soils. Air concentrations of these radionuclides increased about a factor of ten in early 1995 and remained at those levels until the first quarter of 1996. During the spring of 1996 air concentrations again increased by a factor of about ten. No other radionuclides were elevated, and no other Area G stations showed elevations of these radionuclides. After several formal meetings did not provide an adequate explanation for the elevations, a gamma-survey was performed and showed a small area of significant contamination just south of the monitor location. We found that in February 1995, a trench for a water line had been dug within a meter or so of the air stations. Then, during early 1996, the dirt road was rerouted such that its new path was directly over the unknown contamination. It appears that the trenching brought contaminated material to the surface and caused the first rise in air concentrations and then the rerouting of the road over the contamination caused the second rise. during 1996. We also found that during 1976 and 1977 contaminated soils from the clean-up of an old processing facility had been spread over the filled pits in the vicinity of the air monitors. These soils, which were probably the source of the air contamination, were very low in Pu-238 which explains why we saw very little Pu-238 in the increased air concentrations. A layer of gravel and sand as spread over the contaminated area. Although air concentrations of Pu-239 and Am-241 dropped considerably, they have not returned to pre-1995 levels.

An anti-Compton system was set up by combining a large volume HPGe (rei. eff. 115%) with a well type NaI(TI). The detection limit (D.L.) of Cs-137 of an ashed oyster sample for the anti-Compton mode of 115% Ge was 0.023 Bq/sample for 8.10(4) s counting, whereas 0.035 Bq/sample for the normal mode. Under similar measuring conditions, D.L. of Cs-137 for a medium volume HPGe (rel. eff. 51%) was 0.042 Bq/sample, A low-background Ge-LEPS (Low Energy Photon Spectrometer) was sufficiently sensitive for low level measurements of Pb-210, Th-234 and other low energy gamma-emitters. The detection limit for Pb-210 in the sample shape of 60 mm diameter by 2 mm thick was about 0.05 Bq/sample for 5.0.10(5) s background counting. Using this LEPS, it was found that Pb-210 behaves similarly to Be-7 in both air and precipitation (snowfall).

Despite their excellent performance and widespread use, there are significant limitations to this technology. A significant alternative neutron sensor utilizing neutron-active material incorporated into a glass scintillator is presented that offers novel commercial sensors not possible or practical with gas tube technology. The scintillating optical fiber permits sensors with a multitude of sizes ranging from devices of a single fiber of 150 mum to sensors with tens of thousands of fibers with areas as large as 5 m(2) depending on the neutron flux to be measured. A second significant advantage is the use of high-speed electronics that allow a greater dynamic range, not possible with gas detectors. These sensors are flexible, conformable and less sensitive to vibration that optimizes the source-to-detector geometry and provides robust performance in field applications. The glass-fibers are sensitive to both gamma-rays and neutrons. However, the coincidence electronics are optimized for neutron to gamma-ray discrimination allowing very sensitive measurements with a low false-alarm rate. Applications include SNM surveillance, material control and accountability (MC&A), safeguard inspections, Pu health physics/bioassay and environmental characterization.

Such a procedure is of limited relevance to the individual monitoring of workers exposed to plutonium and mixed oxides. The use of ICP-MS, which takes much shorter counting time, was investigated with the aim of assessing the capabilities of this analytical tool for the determination of urinary excretion of plutonium. It has been shown that the detection level of 1 mBq.l(-1) could be achieved after a radiochemical purification process for a standard ICP-MS set-up.

Plutonium concentrations around the south and north discharge area, ranged from 0.054 to 0.24 Bq.kg(-1) (average 0.145) and 0.15 to 0.25 Bq.kg(-1) (average 0.213), respectively. Plutonium concentrations were significantly related to erosion and accumulation processes of sediments in both south and north discharges. Additionally, the ratios of Pu-239 to Pu-240 were evaluated with ICP-MS to determine the origin of the Pu-isotopes. Uranium-238, Th-232 and K-40 were found in concentration range of 7.3-67, 12-100 and 260-560 Bq.kg(-1) with mean concentrations of 20, 29 and 390 Bq.kg(-1), respectively, it is assumed that the relatively high concentrations of the natural radionuclides such as U and Th are due to the presence of minerals (the south discharge regions). On the basis of these results, the origin of the Du-isotopes was assumed to be derived from fallout of the past atmospheric nuclear tests.

Our results show that the EGO detector had the highest efficiency (1.0.10(-3)) and the lowest minimum detectable activity (MDA = 5.8 kBq) for the shallow depth DU phantom, relative to the other detectors. The EGO detector also had the highest peak efficiencies (1.7.10(-3) and 5.8.10(-4)) and the lowest MDAs (3.5 and 10.0 kBq) for the medium and deep phantoms, respectively.

The aquatic and terrestrial environments of the atoll are still contaminated with several long-lived radionuclides that were generated during testing. The four major radionuclides found in terrestrial plants and soils are cesium-137, strontium-90, plutonium-239+240 and americium-241. Cesium-137 in the coral soils is more available for uptake by plants than Cs-137 associated with continental soils of North America or Europe. Soil-to-plant Cs-137 median concentration ratios (CR) (kBq.kg(-1) dry weight plant/kBq.kg(-1) dry weight soil) for tropical fruits and vegetables range between 0.8 and 36, much larger than the range of 0.005 to 0.5 reported for vegetation in temperate zones. Conversely, Sr-90 median CRs range from 0.006 to 1.0 at the atoll versus a range from 0.02 to 3.0 for continental silica-based soils. Thus, the relative uptake of Cs-137 and Sr-90 by plants in carbonate soils is reversed from that observed in silica-based soils. The CRs for Pu239+240 and Am-241 are very similar to those observed in continental soils. Values range from 10(-6) to 10(-4) for both Pu239+240 and Am-241. No significant difference is observed between the two in coral soil. The uptake of Cs-137 by plants is enhanced because of the absence of mineral binding sites and the low concentration of potassium in the coral soil. Cesium-137 is bound to the organic fraction of the soil, whereas Sr-90, Pu239+240 and Am-241 are primarily bound to soil particles. Assessment of plant uptake for Cs-137 and Sr-90 into locally grown food crops was a major contributing factor in: (1) reliably predicting the radiological dose for returning residents and (2) developing a strategy to limit the availability and uptake of Cs-137 into locally grown food crops.

The approach developed allows to estimate the contributions from each component. This approach is necessary for estimating the average and collective doses to the population of different regions or settlements. Verifications of this approach have been made using autopsy data (the early stage of the accident, Kiev residents, the late stage inhabitants of the Ovruch region) which are in good agreement. Assessment of the dose from transuranics to the population of the Ukraine required using bioassay data. This was achieved by measuring the urinary excretion of Pu.

Ashes of each individual corpse were ground, homogenized and sealed in a steel can for 30 days before gamma-spectroscopy measurements were made to determine the Ra-228,Th-228, U-238, Ra-226 and K-40 contents. The median values of radionuclide contents in our study subjects were generally higher than literature values in which only a selected set of organs had been analyzed. Direct estimates of natural or man-made radionuclides in whole-body human ashes should be more accurate than estimates based on analysis of small bone or tissue samples that require extrapolation to the entire body.

The concentrations of Th in blood serum is in equilibrium with the content of Th in human body and therefore could reflect its content in the body. The daily intake (ingestion and inhalation) and the corresponding concentration of Th in blood serum of a group of subjects living in the high-background (monazite) area of Kerala State were measured and compared with the daily intake and corresponding blood serum concentrations of Th in three other groups of subjects namely: (1) those living in normal background area, (2) administrative staff working in Thorium Plant but not directly exposed to Th and its compounds, and (3) the occupational workers from Thorium Plant working for a time period in the range 15-30 years. The Th concentration in the blood serum of subjects from high background area were found to be only marginally higher in comparison to the similar data from normal background area, which indicated that internal exposure due to Th to the subjects living in high background is quite low.

For conservative elements, this time is approximately equivalent to the net hydrological transport. However, for non-conservative elements such as plutonium, the additional influence of biogeochemical processes decreases the net transport time. In this study, Pu-241 and Pu-239,Pu-240 concentrations in Irish Sea plankton samples, collected in May 1994, were determined acid the Pu-241/Pu-239,Pu-240 ratios calculated. Plutonium-239,240 was measured using a standard method by ion exchange chromatography and alpha counting, and Pu-241 was determined by liquid scintillation counting using the disk-supported technique. The latter showed some methodological problems, which are briefly discussed. The Pu-241/Pu-239,Pu-240 ratios gave an estimate of the "transit time" from Sellafield to the different sampling points. In fact, this time represents the age of plutonium in plankton, i.e., the time lag between release from Sellafield and detection at the different sampling stations. The mean plutonium age was 17+/-2 years (n=10) and 18.6+/-0.8 years (n=13) in phytoplankton and zooplankton, respectively. The spatial distribution was reasonably homogeneous over the Irish Sea. The assimilation-elimination processes of plutonium in plankton are rather rapid. Therefore, it may be assumed that, in this time scale, the plutonium concentrations were in equilibrium with surrounding waters. Thus, it is concluded that plutonium was rather old because resuspension-sedimentation processes had occurred that delayed its transport within the Irish Sea. Therefore, the age of plutonium in plankton represented the hold-up time of plutonium in the sediments from the Irish Sea.

The method begins with digestion and dissolution of the sample. Tracers and/or carriers are added to the sample for the purpose of chemical yield monitoring. Strontium is first separated from the actinides and from most of the interfering constituents of the sample by precipitation as carbonates. Strontium isotopes are purified, and Sr-89 and Sr-90 are measured by gas proportional counting. Actinides are separated and purified by ion exchange chromatography, co-precipitated with neodymium fluoride, filtered, and counted by alpha-particle spectrometry.

Plutonium-241 was clearly shown to be present in the Chernobyl fallout in Finland. Pu was unevenly distributed and the mean radioactivity ratio of Pu-241/Pu-239,Pu-240 was 70 for air and 71 for deposition samples. Here, a radiochemical method for determination of Pu-241 in the environmental samples was also developed. The method was based on the liquid scintillation measurement of Pu-241 With a pulse shape analyser alter Pu separation. Efficiency calibration was performed with the aid of H-3 Standard instead of the Pu-241 standard. The method was tested by comparing the results with the method of Am-241 ingrowth and some reference samples. The detection limit for Pu-241 was 0.007 Bq per sample, The Pu-241 concentrations in the sediment samples taken from the Baltic Sea varied between <0.5 and 27 Bq.kg(-1). The effect of the Chernobyl accident could be seen both from the Pu-241 concentrations and from the Pu isotope ratios in vertical distributions of sliced samples.

The characterization of the TRU mixed waste is not only complex process but rather an expensive undertaking. The process knowledge is the basic foundation of characterization. It is the documented knowledge of processes and materials that generated the waste. The transuranic waste Quality Assurance Program Plan (QAPP) defines the Data Quality Objectives (DQO's) and provides the scope of analytical parameters and methods required to accurately characterize the radioactive mixed waste. Based on the historical data and process knowledge a sampling and analysis plan can be developed to characterize the radioactive hazardous waste. Based on the characterization, an assessment of the regulatory status can be made before the waste could be accepted for disposal at the WIPP facility. The Waste Acceptance Criteria (WAC) developed by WIPP defines the parameters for receiving and final disposal of the TRU waste. The sets of criteria, such as: heat generated, fissile gram equivalent (FGE), plutonium-equivalent (PE) curies, and specifications of a dose rate have to be met before the waste is accepted For deep geological disposal. The characterization of radioactive waste becomes even more complex due to the presence of iron base metals/alloys, aluminum base metals/alloys, organic, chelating agents that are mixed with plastic, rubber, cellulose, soils and cement. Some of the modern characterization technologies that are under development and currently used for TRU mixed wastes are: nondestructive examination, nondestructive assay, headspace gas analysis, and drum coring for Resources Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA) sampling.

One of the most shortcomings is in complex processing of the detector surface and following image analysis. However, present methods which allow reconstruction of track ranges and particle energies are intensively being developed. A developing trend in SSNTD alpha-spectrometry uses automated scanning microscope systems and specially designed mathematical software. Several parameters obtained from the analysis of etched tracks indirectly contained information about alpha-particle ranges in detector. The possibility to use some parameters (minor axis m and track end diameter d) for the spectrometry has been reported earlier. Intercomparison of SSNTD with semiconductor detectors (SCD) for Pu-238,Pu-239 content in bioassay within the interval 10(-3) to 1 Dq has been carried out. This comparison has demonstrated a good coincidence between these independent radiometric methods. A perspective of SSNTD use for spectrometric determination of low level activity is discussed. The background level playing a main role in low level detection has been also estimated. Influence of radon and thoron has been found as insignificant.

However, before such exposure can be determined, the level of the element in a "normal" population must be established. The concentration of uranium in human hair was measured by flow injection - inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (FIAS-ICPMS) after acid digestion of the hair samples. All hair samples were rinsed in order to remove external contamination prior to the digestion in a 2:1 solution of concentrated nitric acid and 30% hydrogen peroxide. The limit of detection of the method, for a 50 mg hair sample, was 0.015 mug/g, mainly due to the presence of impurities in the hydrogen peroxide. The range of uranium concentration in the initial test group was found to be 0.01-0.18 mug/g. The mean and median values of the entire study population were 0.062 and 0.050 mug U/g hair, respectively. Differences between the following sub-populations: male and female, smokers and non-smokers and people below and above 45 years of age were examined.

Non-volatile metabolites in urine were isolated by evaporating an aliquot of urine samples, at room temperature under nitrogen, from animals percutaneously exposed to tritiated thymidine, tritiated formaldehyde, tritium-gas-contaminated metal surfaces and tritiated pump oil. A total of 40 fractions were collected at 1 min intervals with a flow rate of 1 ml min(-1) and their tritium activities were measured. The activity profile of tritium showed that the ratios of non-volatile tritiated metabolites in fraction I (0-20 min) to fraction II (20-40 min) were noticeably different: among the animals exposed to tritiated thymidine (77.2+/-4.5), tritiated formaldehyde (40.9+/-3.3), tritium-gas-contaminated metal surfaces (16.5+/-2.5), or tritiated pump oil (8.7+/-0.4) 24 h post-exposure. Our results suggest that, if the nature of a tritium exposure is unknown, comparison of the ratio of fraction I to fraction II in non-volatile tritiated metabolites may be useful in characterizing the source and the nature of tritium exposure.

The Cs-137 levels in pulp mill liquors were compared with the mill location and the deposition pattern of the Chernobyl fallout and nuclear weapons fallout. The large input of wood (about 2500 m(3) per day) to an average Nordic Kraft mill and the relatively long-term retention time for radiocesium in the Kraft mill recovery cycle enables representative sampling of substances directly related to the activity concentration in wood.

One is a brackish lake, Obuchinuma Lake, and the other is a freshwater lake, Takahokonuma Lake. Tritium concentrations in Obuchinuma Lake had a good negative correlation with salinity at any sampling point and period. We consider that the water of Obuchinuma Lake has been only slightly influenced by precipitation depending on the ratio of seawater and river water of the Futamata River. Tritium concentrations in Takahokonuma Lake ranged from 0.6 to 1.5 Bq.l(-1), and were higher than that in precipitation in Rokkasho-mura. Tritium concentration in rivers flowing into the lakes ranged from 0.7 to 2 Bq.l(-1). and were higher than that in the precipitation. It is assumed that ground waters with higher levels of tritium inflow into the rivers.

Although these persons are generally not involved in any incident, natural radioactivity from U, Th and Ra can be found in their urine or faeces. Uranium has been found with no particular ratio between U-234 and U-238. Th-230, Th-228 and sometimes Th-232 have also been detected Th-228 has generally been found in excess of Th-232. All these measurements were performed by alpha spectrometry. The few Ra-226 results have been measured using the Lucas or emanation method.

The most important nuclide was Am-241 which has a contribution of 60 % to the committed effective dose. The assessment of intake and dose were carried out in accordance to the German guidelines. The mean value for the effective dose was 1.5 mSv (geometric mean 0.67 mSv), calculated over all dose assessments. Intakes more than the ALI could not be detected from 1996 to 1998. Decontamination and decomposition of radioactively contaminated parts of the plant and handling of radioactive waste were found to be the activities with the highest risk of incorporation. Intensive regular cleaning and decontamination of the working places were established to avoid or to reduce incorporations. However the most important requirement is to increase the workers sensitivity to the problems of incorporation of radioactive material by careful instructions related to their individual work. The strict realization of these measures have clearly reduced the risk of intake as can be seen from the results of the incorporation monitoring programme.

J	Rutten, HJ; Haas, KA				Rutten, HJ; Haas, KA			Research on the incineration of plutonium in a modular HTR using thorium-based fuel	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								Large stockpiles of plutonium have accumulated globally. In order to avoid the production of second-generation plutonium during the reuse of this nuclear fuel, it can be incinerated in combination with the fertile material thorium instead of uranium. The coated-particle fuel of high-temperature reactors (HTR) allows a very high heavy metal burnup and thus it can achieve a very high incineration fraction of the initially loaded plutonium (similar to 86%) already during the first reuse in a modular pebble-bed HTR. Only a negligible amount of second-generation plutonium is bred from the small quantity of highly enriched uranium, which is used as make-up fissile material. An optimization of the fractions of Pu, U and Th contained in the fuel elements has been done on condition that a negative temperature coefficient of the reactivity has to be achieved over the whole range of operating temperature.

J	Fu, SN; Kato, T				Fu, SN; Kato, T			RF-chopper for the JHF proton linac	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						proton linear accelerator; RF-chopper; rise and fall time		An RF-chopper possesses merits in both its high deflecting field and compactness. For this reason, it is suitable for chopping a high-current beam in a medium-energy beam-transport line (MEBT) of an ion linear accelerator. The JHF linac, as a high-current H- accelerator with an average current of up to 0.2 mA or higher in the second phase, took these advantages of the RF-chopper in its design. Two RF-deflecting cavities as the chopper will be used in the MEET just downward of the 3-MeV 324-MHz RFQ. A 324-MHz RF-chopper cavity has been designed with optimization for a fast rise/fall time, which is an essential requirement for the chopper in a high-current accelerator in order to avoid radioactivity induced by the lost particles due to insufficient chopping during the transient time. The rise time can be less than 8 ns by means of a pair of ports with large coupling loops. In this paper, the details concerning the R&D of the RF-chopper are presented. Some RF properties calculated with MAFIA and HFSS codes have been compared with the test results of a cold-model cavity, showing good agreement. To cut down on the required RF-power, two RF-deflecting cavities are connected with a coaxial line in the design. The simulation and measurement of the coupled system exhibit a quick rise time that is almost the same as that of an independent cavity. The designed RF-chopper will be used in the JHF linac, which is under construction. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The half-lives for the reaction products range from 11 s to 10.15 days. Quasi monoenergetic neutrons were produced via the H-3(d, n)He-4 reaction. In some cases isotopically enriched materials were used to enhance the reaction yield or to facilitate correction for interfering reactions leading to the same product. The gamma rays emitted from the irradiated samples were measured with a high-purity germanium detector. A pneumatic sample transport system was used to limit the decay of the radioactive products between neutron irradiation and gamma-ray counting. All cross sections were obtained as ratios to the standard reaction Al-27(n, alpha)Na-24, using as secondary neutron fluence references the Al-27(n, p)Mg-27 reaction as well as a calibrated Bonner sphere. Corrections have been applied for sample irradiation and counting environment geometric effects, neutron absorption and multiple scattering, time variation of neutron-source strength, neutron-source angular distributions, secondary neutrons from the target, gamma-ray absorption, and gamma-ray sum coincidences. A detailed analysis of the uncertainty sources was performed The present results are compared with other measurements and evaluated data. For seven reactions, measured cross sections have been obtained for the first time beyond 15 MeV. These new data help appreciably to resolve discrepancies in evaluated data files.

J	Schwartz, KL; Beard, CA				Schwartz, KL; Beard, CA			Process modeling of plutonium conversion and mixed-oxide fuel fabrication for plutonium disposition	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						plutonium; MOX fuel; plutonium processing		In an effort to reduce the global stockpile of nuclear explosive devices, similar to 50 tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium have been declared surplus to national security needs by the United States. This surplus, located at six sites within the U.S. Department of Energy complex (the Hanford Site, Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory the Pantex Plant, the Rocy Flats Environmental Technology Site, and the Savannah River Site) must now be rendered unattractive for use in nuclear weapons. The goal is that this drive will be concurrent with similar activities in Russia. One method currently under investigation is the conversion of the plutonium metal into mixed-oxide (MOX) reactor fuel. Approximately 35 tonnes of the surplus plutonium is in a form suitable for fabrication into MOX fuel. This fuel would be used in currently operating reactors for power production. Two processes are currently under consideration for the disposition of the 35 tonnes of surplus plutonium through its conversion into fuel for power production. These processes are the Advanced Recovery and Integrated Extraction System (ARIES) process, by which Plutonium metal is converted into a powdered oxide form, and MOX fuel fabrication, where the oxide powder is combined with uranium oxide powder to form ceramic fuel. Because it is envisioned that plutonium disposition will occur concurrently in the United States and Russia, the timely disposition of the plutonium is deemed important to national security. However, the need for quick disposition must be tempered by cost considerations and constraints on the reactors that will ultimately use the fuel. This study was undertaken to determine the optimal size for both the pit conversion and MOX fabrication facilities, whereby the 35 tonnes of plutonium metal will be converted into fuel and burned for power. Proper sizing of the facilities will help avoid unnecessary delays and excessive costs and thus is important in the success of the disposition mission. The bounding conditions used were a plutonium concentration of 3 to 7%, a burnup of 20 000 to 40 000 MWd/tonnes HM, a core fraction of 0.1 to 0.4, and the number of reactors ranging from 2 to 6. Using these boundary conditions, the optimal plutonium concentration was found to be 7%. This resulted in an optimal throughput ranging from 2000 to 5000 kg/yr of plutonium. The data showed minimal costs (based solely on facility size and required manpower) resulting from throughputs in this range, at 3840, 2779, and 3497 kg/yr of plutonium, which resulted in a facility lifetime of 9.1, 12.6, and 10.0 yr, respectively.

J	Hosoma, T; Aritomi, M; Kawa, T				Hosoma, T; Aritomi, M; Kawa, T			Formulas to correct excess pressure and pressure shift to be used in volume measurement for plutonium nitrate solution	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						plutonium nitrate solution; dip-tube pressure measurement; material control and accountability		Excess pressure caused by the bubble and the pressure shift resulting from the air column in a dip-tube pressure measurement are the error sources to be considered for highly accurate density, level, and volume determination of plutonium nitrate solution in a tank. A new approach to estimate the maximum, the minimum, and the average of oscillating excess pressure as a function of tube diameter d, solution density rho, and surface tension CT without including height, curvature, and amplitude of the bubble is proposed. This approach can be applied sigma without reducing the rate of downward airflow that is necessary to prevent contamination. When the estimates were compared with the experimental results in a water-ethanol system within the range 3.6 X 10(-6) less than or equal to sigma/(rho g) less than or equal to 7.4 x 10(-6) (m(2)) and 1.8 less than or equal to d root rho g/sigma less than or equal to 9.6 the mean of the difference was <2 Pa. The estimate for the maximum excess pressure was also compared with the conventional formula, and the difference was <1 Pa. We also proposed an equation to estimate the surface tension of the plutonium nitrate solution. For the pressure shift, a new formula assuming that the air density varies exponentially in the tube is proposed. The measured differential pressure is proportional to the hydrostatic pressure, and the coefficient is nearly independent of the liquid level. These correction factors of excess pressure and pressure shift cart practically be given as constants.

Korea is in the process of preparing for its first ever vitrification plant to handle LLW from its NPPs. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) has the largess volume of dry active wastes and is the main waste stream to treat. Glass formulation development for PVC waste is the focus of study. The minimum additive waste stabilization approach has been utilized in vitrification. It was found that glasses can incorporate a high content of PVC ash (up to 50 wt%), which results in a large volume reduction. A glass frit, KEP-A, was developed to vitrify PVC waste after the optimization of waste lending, melt viscosity melting temperature, and chemical durability,. The KEP-A could satisfactorily vitrify PVC,vith a waste loading of 30 to 50 wt%. The PVC-frit was tolerant of variations in waste composition.

With an increase of AA composition in AN/AA monomer mixture, the water uptake of the grafted polyethylene film increased. In AN/AA mixture, the maximum adsorption of UO22+ was observed in the adsorbent with a ratio of AN/AA (50/50, mol%) in copolymer. The amidoxime, carboxyl, and amidoxime/carboxyl groups onto PE acted as a chelating site for the selected UO22+. The complex structure of polyethylene with three functional groups and UO22+ was confirmed by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Tn the course of experimental work in the region of the elements with 92 less than or equal to Z less than or equal to 94, 14 new isotopes have been identified by the parent-daughter correlations. For further experiments aimed at the synthesis of the superheavy element isotopes (Z greater than or equal to 110) with intensive Ca-48 extracted beams, improvements in the focal plane detector system have been made. As a result, energy and position resolutions of the detectors have been significantly improved, the detection efficiency for the alpha-particles, emitted from the implanted into the focal plane detector recoil nuclei, has been increased to 85%. The decay properties of the now isotope of element 112 and the isotope of the new element 114 with mass 287 have been measured in two-nuclei decays. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Diodes fabricated from silicon with interstitial oxygen content ranging from below 2 x 10(14) to 9 x 10(17) cm(-3) have been irradiated with fast neutrons up to a fluence of 2 x 10(15) cm(-2). Our main interest focused on the so-called stable damage component in the change of the effective doping concentration being of prime importance for the application of silicon detectors in high-energy physics experiments. We demonstrate, that with a high oxygen enrichment the donor removal is appreciably reduced, reaching a value of only 10% of the initial doping concentration for [O-i] = 9 x 10(17) cm(-3), while for normal detector grade material with [O-i] below 5 x 10(16) cm(-3) that value is 60-90%. Furthermore, we show that the fluence proportional introduction of stable acceptors is independent of the oxygen concentration with an averaged introduction rate of (1.49 +/- 0.03) x 10(-2) cm(-1). Only one material was found exhibiting a significantly smaller value of about 0.6 x 10(-2) cm(-1) and thus indicating the possibility to suppress the radiation-induced acceptor creation by material modification. Finally, we show that the experimental findings disagree in several important aspects with predictions made by microscopic defect kinetics models, leaving the physical background of some of the measured data as an open question.

J	Choi, H				Choi, H			A fast-running fuel management program for a CANDU reactor	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								A fast-running fuel management program for a CANDU reactor has been developed. The basic principle of this program is to select refueling channels such that the reference reactor conditions are maintained by applying several constraints and criteria when selecting refueling channels. The constraints used in this program are the channel and bundle power and the fuel burnup. The final selection of the refueling channel is determined based on the priority of candidate channels, which enhances the reactor power distribution close to the time-average model. The refueling simulation was performed for a natural uranium CANDU reactor and the results were satisfactory. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The prediction capability of the core nuclear analysis code system, being developed as a standard analysis system in the KALIMER core design and analysis, has been evaluated against the BFS-73-1 experiment by comparing the calculated results to the measurements. The comparison shows that the effective multiplication factor was overpredicted by 0.3% in the C/E value. The U-235 and U-238 fission reaction rate distributions were underpredicted within a 2% discrepancy in the core region but appeared to be in poor agreement in the blanket region. The calculated values of spectral indices at the core center and the effective delayed neutron fraction, b(eff), agreed with the measured ones within 2% and 1% discrepancies, respectively. The first order perturbation method predicted the sample reactivity worths for U-235, U-238, Pu-239 and B-10 within 7% but much larger discrepancies existed for the other materials. The calculated Doppler effect showed about an 8% overprediction. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Williams, MMR				Williams, MMR			The effect of random geometry on the criticality of a multiplying system	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								A method has been developed for calculating the probability distribution of the multiplication factor in a reactor in which the fuel elements are randomly distributed across the core. The method is also applicable to waste storage drums in which lumps of fissile waste material are stored in a background matrix. The procedure is based upon the Feinberg-Galanin-Horning method of heterogeneous reactors, in which the fuel element or fissile lump is replaced by a point, line or plane sink of thermal neutrons and a similar source of fast neutrons. The fuel element positions are chosen to lie randomly in the core and for each realisation a criticality calculation is carried out. Thus a large number of Values of k(eff) is obtained and reduced to a probability distribution P(k(eff)). We observe that k(eff) lies in the range k(eff),(min), k(eff),(max)), where the very small value k(eff),(min) arises when all elements lie on the reactor boundary, and the value of k(eff),(max) when all elements are fortuitously in the position of minimum critical mass. A further simulation is carried out in which the fuel elements are notionally at a fixed position in a regular lattice but are allowed to vary randomly about the position by 10% of the lattice pitch. In this case, the distribution in k(eff) is found to be highly symmetrical about the critical value of k(eff) = 1 and the distribution appears to be Gaussian. The methods developed will also be useful for safety assessments arising in the storage of fissile material and general problems in radioactive waste disposal. An analytical method has been developed for calculating P(k(eff)) for N randomly distributed plates and illustrated for the case of a reactor containing one plate. The agreement between the simulation and the analytical method is excellent. It also seems likely that P(k(eff)) becomes Gaussian-like as the number of plates increases.

J	Colle, R				Colle, R			On the radioanalytical methods used to assay stainless-steel-encapsulated, ceramic-based Sr-90-Y-90 intravascular brachytherapy sources	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article							LIQUID SCINTILLATION SPECTROMETRY; COCKTAIL MASS VOLUME; EMITTING RADIONUCLIDES; H2O FRACTION; HALF-LIFE; H-3; STANDARDIZATION; EFFICIENCY; NI-63	Very quantitative radiochemical procedures for the destructive assay of stainless-steel-encapsulated, ceramic-based Sr-90-Y-90 intravascular brachytherapy sources (termed 'seeds') have been devised, These seeds, developed and provided by Bebig Isotopentechnic und Umweltdiagnostik (Berlin, Germany) in collaboration with the Novoste Corporation (Norcross, GA), are intended for use in the prophylactic treatment of restenosis following balloon angioplasty in heart-disease patients. The procedures were applied to the radionuclidic assay of both the bare-ceramic source materials (of proprietary composition) contained within the seeds and to the stainless-steel (SS) sealed sources. The approach consisted of extracting some arbitrary fraction of the Sr-90 activity from the ceramic-like material and assaying the resulting solution by 4 pi beta liquid scintillation (LS) spectrometry with H-3-standard efficiency tracing. The fraction of extracted activity was determined by ionization current measurements before and after the chemical extraction. All of the ionization current and LS-based activity determinations were made under the experimentally-verified conditional that Y-90 was in radioactive equilibrium with Sr-90. For the assay of the SS-jacketed seeds, the encapsulation was initially dissolved and the resultant solution was also assayed by LS spectrometry to determine the amount of activity removed by the SS dissolution step. The developed protocol included provisions for accounting for all possible losses of Sr-90 activity in the chemical and source-handling procedures, for the unrecovered activity in the extracted source material and for any residual activity in the solution-transfer and source-handling tools, These destructive assays were required for relating radiochromic-film measurements of the absorbed dose spatial distributions for the seeds to theoretic dose modelling and for establishing calibration factors for subsequent non-destructive radionuclidic measurements on the seeds.

In this study, we radiolabeled biodegradable HSA microspheres (mean diameter = 25 mu m) with the short-lived beta-emitter Re-188 available from the aluminia-based W-188/Re-188 generator system. After 1 h 35-40% of the relative large amount of Sn(II) chloride required for effective reduction of Re(VII) for efficient attachment to the particles is precipitated as an amorphous coat of tin hydroxid colloid on the particle surface. The final Re-188 bound to the particles was found to be stable in vitro. The radiolabelling yield was > 90%. The biological half-life was > 250 h and demonstrated sufficient in vivo stability after i.v. injection in Wistar rats. Because of the attractive properties of Re-188 and the uniform particle size and stability, in vivo, this new agent is an attractive candidate for endoradiotherapy of tumors after selective catheterization.
