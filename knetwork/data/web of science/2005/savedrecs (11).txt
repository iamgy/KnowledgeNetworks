NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Topical Meeting of the American-Nuclear-Society on Advances in Nuclear Fuel Management III	OCT 05-08, 2003	Hilton Head Isl, SC	Amer Nucl Soc		power uprate; 2-yr cycles; BWR fuel		Boiling water reactors (BWRs) in the United States have transitioned over the past 30 yr from 7 X 7 and 8 X 8 fuels, 12-month cycles, and batch average burnups of 30 GWd/tonne U to 10 X 10 fuel, 18- to 24-month cycles, batch average burnups off GWd/tonne U, and 5% power uprates in the 1990s. The next step for BWRs in the new millennium is 24-month cycles and extended power uprates as high as 120% power. These operating conditions lead to large reload fuel batch sizes (up to 45% of the core) that result in lower batch average discharge burnups (similar to 45 GWd/tonne U). Parameters driving the drop in fuel burnup include enrichment limitations and the need for fuel performance improvements. The next steps to achieve better BWR fuel cycle economics and their associated benefits and implementation challenges are discussed in this paper.

The Studsvik Scandpower code suite was used to model a Westinghouse three-loop PWR core, and realistic loading patterns were derived. The loading patterns were optimized for minimum power peaking and maximum cycle length using engineering judgment and automated binary shuffles. Gadolinia was found to control power peaking to within current F-Delta H design limits up to 70 GWd/tonne, with only a slight deterioration thereafter. The moderator temperature coefficient, boron coefficient, and control rod worth were calculated and shown to fall within existing design limits. An economic analysis was carried out to determine the most economic discharge burnup based on fuel cycle costs only. It was found that the lowest fuel cycle costs were obtained with average discharge burnups between 70 to 75 GWd/tonne (initial enrichments between 6 to 7 wt%). The energy generated per tonne of uranium ore used was calculated and shown to peak between 40 to 60 GWd/tonne. Also, the radiotoxicity generated per GW.yr(electric) was calculated for each fuel management scheme and found to reduce considerably with burnup between 100 and 100000 yr.

The experiments will be conducted at the SNL Pulsed Reactor Facility. Framatome ANP and SNL produced two series of conceptual experiment designs based on typical parameters, such as fuel-to-moderator ratios, that meet the programmatic requirements of this project within the given restraints on available materials and facilities. ORNL used the Tools for Sensitivity and Uncertainty Analysis Methodology implementation (TSUNAMI) to assess, from a detailed physics-based perspective, the similarity of the experiment designs to the commercial systems they are intended to validate. Based on the results of the TSUNAMI analysis, one series of experiments was found to be preferable to the other and will provide significant new data for the validation of reactor physics and criticality safety codes.

Since fast breeder reactors are at present not available, the majority of spent fuel discharged from commercial nuclear reactors is intended for direct final disposal or designated for interim storage. An effective form of intermediate plutonium storage is recycling in thermal reactors. Recycling of the recovered plutonium in commercial light water reactors (LWRs) is currently practiced in Belgium, France, Germany, and Switzerland. The number of mixed-oxide (MOX) assemblies reloaded each year in a large variety of reactors demonstrates that plutonium recycling in LWRs has reached industrial maturity. The status of experience gained today at Framatome ANP confirms the reliability of the design codes and the suitability of fuel assembly and core designs. The validation database for increasing exposures of MOX fuel is being continuously expanded. This provides the basis for further extending the discharge exposures of MOX assemblies and for licensing the use of higher plutonium concentrations. Options to support the weapons plutonium reduction programs and for the development of advanced MOX assembly designs are investigated.

The main sources of proliferation potential and radiotoxicity are the plutonium and higher actinides generated during the burnup of standard LWR fuel. A significant reduction in the quantity and quality of the generated Pu can be achieved by replacing the U-238 fertile component of conventional low-enriched uranium fuel by Th-232. Thorium can also be used as a way to manage the growth of plutonium stockpiles by burning plutonium, or achieving a net-Zero transuranic production, sustainable recycle scenario. This paper summarizes some of the results of recent studies of the performance of thorium-based fuels. It is concluded that the use of heterogeneous U-Th fuel provides higher neutronic potential than a homogeneous fuel. However, in the former case, the uranium portion of the fuel operates at a higher power density, and care is needed to meet the thermal margins and address the higher-burnup implications. In macro-heterogeneous designs, the U-Th fuel can yield reduced spent-fuel volume, toxicity, and decay heat. The main advantage of Pu-Th oxide over mixed oxide is better void reactivity behavior even for undermoderated designs, and increased burnup of Pu.

One option is once-for-life cores having relatively low power density. These cores are fueled in the factory; there is no refueling or fuel shuffling on site. A second option is very long-life cores being made of a fissioning zone and a natural uranium blanket zone. The fissioning zone very slowly drifts toward the blanket. A third option is multirecycling of light water reactor (LWR) discharged fuel without partitioning of transuranics (TRUs) in fuel-self-sustaining reactors. LWR spent fuel could provide the initial fuel loading after extracting fission products and similar to 90% of its uranium. The makeup fuel is natural or depleted uranium. A fourth option is the high-burnup once-through fuel cycle using natural or depleted uranium feed. The initial fuel loading of this reactor is a mixture of enriched and natural uranium. The natural uranium utilization is 10 to 20 times higher than that of a once-through LWR. A fifth option is transmutation of TRUs from LWRs using critical HLM-cooled reactors; such reactors could be designed to have the same high actinide burning capability of accelerator-driven systems and have comparable safety, but at a substantially lower cost. These novel reactor designs and fuel management options are hereby reviewed.

For pebbles fueled with different loadings of plutonium, the feasibility of a sustained fuel cycle under nominal reactor conditions was investigated by means of the reactivity and temperature coefficients of the reactor. The HTR-MODUL was found to be a very effective reactor to reduce the stockpile of first-generation plutonium. It reduces the amount of plutonium to about one-sixth of the original and reduces the risk of proliferation by denaturing the plutonium vector. For second-generation plutonium the incineration is less favorable, as the amount of plutonium is only halved.

It deploys highly enriched uranium, water-cooled concentric plate fuel elements, positioned inside a beryllium reflector with a complex hyperboloid arrangement of test holes. The objective of this paper is to validate the MCNP&ORIGEN-S three-dimensional (3-D) model for reactivity predictions of the entire BR2 core during reactor operation. We employ the Monte Carlo code MCNP-4C to evaluate the effective multiplication factor k(eff) and 3-D space-dependent specific power distribution. The one-dimensional code ORIGEN-S is used to calculate the isotopic fuel depletion versus burnup and to prepare a database with depleted fuel compositions. The approach taken is to evaluate the 3-D power distribution at each time step and along with the database to evaluate the 3-D isotopic fuel depletion at the next step and to deduce the corresponding shim rod positions of the reactor operation. The capabilities of both codes are fully exploited without constraints on the number of involved isotope depletion chains or an increase of the computational time. The reactor has a complex operation, with important shutdowns between cycles, and its reactivity is strongly influenced by poisons, mainly He-3 and Li-6 from the beryllium reflector, and the burnable absorbers Sm-149 and B-10 in the fresh UAlx, fuel. The computational predictions for the shim rod positions at various restarts are within 0.5 $ (beta(eff) = 0.0072).

Radon (Rn-222) and thoron (Rn-220) alpha-activities per unit volume were evaluated inside and outside the marble samples studied. Radon emanation coefficient was determined for the considered marble samples. Alpha- and beta-activities per unit volume of air due to radon, thoron and their progenies were measured in the atmosphere of a marble factory. Equilibrium factors between radon and its progeny and thoron and its decay products were evaluated in the air of the studied marble factory. The committed equivalent doses due to short-lived radon decay products were determined in different regions of the respiratory tract of workers in the considered marble factory.

Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 were determined in soil samples collected from some areas of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, using gamma ray spectrometry. The soil activity ranges from 18.22 to 90.30 Bq kg(-1) for Ra-226, 34.80 to 124.68 Bq kg(-1) for Th-232 and 80.42 to 181.41 Bq kg(-1) for K-40 with mean values of 57, 87 and 143 Bq kg(-1), respectively. The concentrations of these radionuclides are compared with the available data from other countries. The measured activity concentration of Ra-226 and Th-232 in soil is higher and for K-40 is lower than the world average. Radium equivalent activities are calculated for the analyzed samples to assess the radiation hazards arising due to the use of these soil samples in the construction of dwellings. All the soil samples have radium equivalent activities lower than the limit set in the OECD report (370 Bq kg(-1)). The overall mean outdoor terrestrial gamma dose rate is 86.54 nGy h(-1) and the corresponding outdoor annual effective dose is 0.11 mSv. The activity concentration of U-238 has also been determined using fission track technique and the values range from 1.18 to 5.12 ppm with mean value of 2.13 ppm. The content of radioactive elements in the soil of Palmpur area is found to be more compared with the samples from the other study areas of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The results show that by increasing the fluence to 6.3 x 10(15) cm(-2), the mass loss ratio ascends dramatically and then tends to level off. The mass loss behavior can be attributed to the combined effects of the formation of gaseous radiolytic products and a degraded layer, the surface ablation due to discharging and the skin carbon enrichment.

This is of particular interest for characterizing the decay properties of refractory elements and is applied to neutron-rich nuclei between Z = 20-28. As a first step of this project, the kinematics of quasi- and deep-inelastic reactions, such as Au-197((CU)-C-65,X)Y, were studied. Based on these studies, a specialized IGISOL target chamber was designed and built. This chamber was tested in on- and off-line conditions at the Jyvaskyla IGISOL facility. Yields of radioactive, projectile-like species such as Co-62. 63 are about 0.8 ions/s/pnA corresponding to a total IGISOL efficiency of about 0.06%. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The investigated background includes neutrons from rock and detector components, generated via spontaneous fission and (alpha,n) reactions, as well as those due to cosmic-ray muons. Neutrons were propagated to the sensitive volume of the detector and the nuclear recoil spectra were calculated. Methods of neutron background suppression were also examined and limitations to the sensitivity of a gaseous dark matter detector are discussed. Results indicate that neutrons should not limit sensitivity to WIMP-nucleon interactions down to a level of (I - 3) x 10(-8) pb in a 10 kg detector. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ahmed, R; Aslam; Ahmad, N				Ahmed, R; Aslam; Ahmad, N			Burnup study for Pakistan Research Reactor-1 utilizing high density low enriched uranium fuel	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							NEUTRON ENERGY-SPECTRUM; CRITICALITY; CORE	Burnup study for Pakistan Research Reactor-1 (PARR-1), which is a typical swimming pool type MTR utilizing high density low enriched uranium fuel, was performed by using Fuel Cycle Analysis Program (FCAP). Existing equilibrium core of PARR-1, which is relatively economical but provides less neutron fluxes per unit power than the first equilibrium core, was formed by adding five more fuel elements in the first equilibrium core. This study shows that if the fuel loading is increased in the first equilibrium core of PARR-1 by replacing the fuel of density 3.28 gU/cm(3) by the fuel of density 4.00 gU/cm(3) then the new equilibrium core can provide 10% higher neutron fluxes at the irradiation sites and will also require 1.5 kg less fuel than that required for existing equilibrium core for one-year full power operation at 10 MW. The new core provides neutron fluxes at 13% lower cost and if the size of this core is further reduced by three fuel elements then this core can provide 20% higher thermal neutron flux at the central flux trap at 9% lower cost. A possible use of U-Mo (5 w/o Mo) fuel of density 8.5 gU/cm(3) in PARR-1 with an increase in existing water channel width from 2.1 to 2.45 mm (Ann. Nucl. Energy 32(1), 29-62) would provide up to 41% more thermal neutron flux at the central flux trap at 13% lower cost than the existing equilibrium core. The power peaking factors in these cores are similar to the power peaking factors of the existing equilibrium core and these cores are likely to operate within the safety constraints as defined for the existing equilibrium core of PARR-1.

J	Baker, M				Baker, M			Calibration of the NPL secondary standard radionuclide calibrator for the new 10R Schott, Type 1+vials	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						NPL secondary standard radionuclide calibrator; activity; 10R Schott; type 1+vials; nuclear medicine; calibration factors		For many years, P6 vials have been used for the distribution of a wide range of diagnostic and therapeutic radioactive solutions. The activity measurements were performed in this geometry and, in time, the UK calibration system for nuclear medicine was based on this container as a standard. However, one major supplier of radiopharmaceuticals has replaced the P6 vial with the 10R Type I + Schott vial. As the dimensions of the new vial are different from those of the P6 vial and the responses of radionuclide calibrators are known to be container dependent, the need for re-calibration became apparent.,Preliminary measurements made on some typical radionuclide calibrators for 1 251 solution indicated a difference in response of about 10% between the two vials. The master ionisation chamber of the NPL secondary standard radionuclide calibrator has been re-calibrated and new calibration factors and volume correction factors for 10R Schott vials have been derived for the relevant medical radionuclides. The standard holder was also modified to accommodate the new larger vial. The complete list of factors and the method used to determine them is presented in this paper. The availability of these new factors will improve the quality of activity measurements in nuclear medicine, as calibration services can now be provided by NPL for the new container. These factors can also be employed for all commercial NPL secondary standard radionuclide calibrators (now known as the NPL-CRC and previously as the 671 or ISOCAL IV). (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

It was found that for all densities (0.4-1.7 g/cm(3)) studied the counting efficiency (epsilon) fits the linear log-log dependence on the photon energy (E) above 200 keV, i.e. obeying the equation epsilon = alpha E-beta (alpha, beta-parameters). It was found that for each photon energy the counting efficiency is linearly dependent on the density (rho) of the matrix. epsilon = a - bp (a, b-parameters). The parameters of the linear dependence are energy dependent (linear log-log dependence), leading to a final equation for the counting efficiency of Marinelli beaker involving both density of the matrix and the photon energy: epsilon =alpha(1) (.)

J	Hilgers, K; Sudar, S; Qaim, SM				Hilgers, K; Sudar, S; Qaim, SM			Experimental study and nuclear model calculations on the Os-192(p,n) Ir-192 reaction: Comparison of reactor and cyclotron production of the therapeutic radionuclide Ir-192	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						iridium-192; cross section; excitation function; nuclear model calculations; medical radioisotope; production yield	EXCITATION-FUNCTIONS; THRESHOLDS	In a search for an alternative route of production of the important therapeutic radionuclide Ir-192 (T-1/2 = 78.83 d), the excitation function of the reaction Os-192(p,n) Ir-192 was investigated from its threshold up to 20 MeV. Thin samples of enriched (OS)-O-192 were obtained by electrodeposition on Ni, and the conventional stacked-foil technique was used for cross section measurements. The experimental data were compared with the results of theoretical calculations using the codes EMPIRE-H and ALICE-IPPE. Good agreement was found with EMPIRE-II, but slightly less with the ALICE-IPPE calculations. The theoretical thick target yield of Ir-192 over the energy range E-p = 16 -> 8 MeV amounts to only 0.16 MBq/mu A (.) h. A comparison of the reactor and cyclotron production methods is given. In terms of yield and radionuclidic purity of Ir-192 the reactor method appears to be superior; the only advantage of the cyclotron method could be the higher specific activity of the product.

The activity concentrations (in Bq g(-1)) were determined using the 4 pi(proportional counter)-gamma coincidence counting method with efficiency extrapolation. Liquid scintillation methods were also used for Am-241 activity determination. The 1115.5 keV of Zn-65 and the 26.35 and 59.54 keV of Am-241 gamma-ray emission probabilities were determined as 0.4971, 0.0206 and 0.3587, respectively, using a planar germanium detector.

J	Min, MZ; Peng, XJ; Wang, JP; Osmond, JK				Min, MZ; Peng, XJ; Wang, JP; Osmond, JK			Uranium-series disequilibria as a means to study recent migration of uranium in a sandstone-hosted uranium deposit, NW China	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						sandstone-hosted uranium deposit; uranium migration; uranium-series disequilibrium	RADIONUCLIDE; ANALOG; FRONT; U-238	Uranium concentration and alpha specific activities of uranium decay series nuclides U-234, U-238, Th-230, Th-232 and Ra-226 were measured for 16 oxidized host sandstone samples, 36 oxic-anoxic (mineralized) sandstone samples and three unaltered primary sandstone samples collected from the Shihongtan deposit. The results show that most of the ores and host sandstones have close to secular equilibrium alpha activity ratios for U-234/U-238, Th-230/U-238, Th-230/U-234 and Ra-226/Th-230, indicating that intensive groundwater-rock/ore interaction and uranium migration have not taken place in the deposit during the last 1.0 Ma. However, some of the old uranium ore bodies have locally undergone leaching in the oxidizing environment during the past 300 ka to 1.0 Ma or to the present, and a number of new U ore bodies have grown in the oxic-anoxic transition (mineralized) subzone during the past 1.0 Ma. Locally, uranium leaching has taken place during the past 300 ka to 1.0 Ma, and perhaps is still going on now in some sandstones of the oxidizing subzone. However, uranium accumulation has locally occurred in some sandstones of the oxidizing environment during the past 1 ka to 1.0 Ma, which may be attributed to adsorption of U(VI) by clays contained in oxidized sandstones. A recent accumulation of uranium has locally taken place within the unaltered sandstones of the primary subzone close to the oxic-anoxic transition environment during the past 300 ka to 1.0 Ma. Results from the present study also indicate that uranium-series disequilibrium is an important tool to trace recent migration of uranium occurring in sandstone-hosted U deposits during the past 1.0 Ma and to distinguish the oxidation-reduction boundary.

J	Guldner, R				Guldner, R			2005 Annual Nuclear Technology Conference: Opening address	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Editorial Material								Nuclear power is experiencing an upswing worldwide High prices of conventional fuels, discussions about the long-term continuity of supply, rising energy requirements, and the search for efficient ways of protecting the climate have moved nuclear power back into focus in a positive way. This is also true for Germany. In this country, nuclear power has gone through twelve very successful months since the 2004 Nuclear Technology Conference in Dusseldorf, as is home out by the performance of all nuclear power plants in Germany. A change of mood towards a positive of nuclear power is taking place in Germany. It is also seen, however, that the "problem" of final storage, which has been solved technically, is in urgent need of a political solution. German know-how in nuclear technology enjoys a high reputation internationally. For manufacturers and the associated supplier industries, this means excellent market opportunities. also for future projects, in view of worldwide demand. Various nuclear projects have progressed at long last: The Heinz Meier-Leibnitz research reactor (FRM-II) has been commissioned: the final stage of expansion of the Urenco uranium enrichment plant in Gronau has been approved the license for a capacity increase in the ANF fuel fabrication plant in Lingen has been granted. Nuclear power is enjoying it high reputation also in the European Union. Major expansion plans exist in Asia. while increases in power and performance as well as life extensions can be observed in the United States. The world needs a sustainable energy mix - with nuclear power.

J	Wiesheu, O				Wiesheu, O			2005 Annual Nuclear Technology Conference: Plenary address	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Editorial Material								The use of nuclear Power oil an industrial scale in Germany has its roots in Bavaria, more specifically. in the Nuremberg-Furth-Erlangen region with the then Siemens-Schuckertwerke and the so-called Reactor Development Study Group, the Garching Atomic Egg, the Kahl Experimental Nuclear Power Station, and Unit A of the Gandremmungen Demonstration Nuclear Power Station. This development is continued successfully by Pramatome ANP, as is demonstrated by the contract for the EPR in Finland and the decision to build a new EPR in France. The Policy pursued by the German federal government has strayed from any rational energy policy needed by Germany as it location of industry and by the German economy and the labor market. In this situation, Bavaria took the initiative last year by developing its own energy concept for Germany in order to establish a clear line and direction in the debate about energy policy. regard energy policy, its a part of economic policy, take into account Social market economy in energy policy, stop the policy of making energy more and more expensive, assign it key role to research and development, and minimize risks by establishing it broad energy mix. In the field of nuclear power. Bavaria is in favor specifically of preserving nuclear know-how at universities, - allowing research and development to be resumed in all areas of reactor technology, - further developing waste and spent fuel management, ready for it decision. - abolish the arbitrary limitations of plant lire of existing nuclear power plants and - making international cooperation in nuclear technology Possible.

J	Khatib-Rahbar, M; Karimi, R; Lantaron, A				Khatib-Rahbar, M; Karimi, R; Lantaron, A			Importance of severe accident radiological releases and definition of large release	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article								Analysis results are presented on the determination of the importance of severe accidents radiological releases into the environment, in terms of various off-site consequences. It is shown that in addition to iodine, the release of tellurium, barium, cerium, cesium, curium, lanthanum, molybdenum, niobium, plutonium, ruthenium, strontium, yttrium and (radioactive) zirconium are important to early fatality health effects, provided an equal and complete release of these nuclides were to be postulated, however, considering the conditions under which fission product releases occur, only the nuclides of iodine, cesium, tellurium, and to a lesser extent, the nuclides of molybdenum, strontium, and barium are consequentially of significance, because, quantitatively significant releases of the other nuclides are not envisioned. Furthermore, in terms of latent health effects, it is shown that nuclides of americium, cesium, cobalt, curium, and plutonium are important, if an equal and complete release were to be postulated. Here again, during severe accidents, large releases for the aforementioned nuclides other than cesium are not likely. Therefore, cesium remains as the nuclide of greatest significance from a standpoint of long-term effects of severe accidents. The noble gases are shown to be inconsequential. The paper also examines the potential implications of various definitions of "large release" based on the results of level-2 probabilistic safety assessments for typical light water reactors. It is shown that the definition of alternatives that are based on latent effects are more restrictive than those based on early effects, and for large reactors, those alternatives that are defined on the basis of simple release thresholds are generally less ambiguous and easier to define, implement, and verily.

J	[Anonymous]				[Anonymous]			2004 performance of German nuclear power plants	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								The 2004 Annual Report by the VGB PowerTech Committee on "Nuclear Power Plant Operation" also summarizes the performance of the nuclear power plants in operation in Germany. The eighteen nuclear generating units in operation in Germany in 2004 with an aggregate installed capacity of 21,693 MWe (gross) and 20,643 MWe((net)), respectively, converted a total of 167 billion kWh of nuclear power into electrical energy and made available, respectively, 156 billion kWh net. Especially due to higher availabilities of some plants, this is approx. 2 billion kWh (gross) more than in 2003. The reliability of plant operation is underlined by the high average availability in terms of time of 87.66%. The technical safety indicators continue to be good for 2004. Releases of radioactive substances were very low, far below the licensed levels. There were no accidents. Plant performance, safety-related events, major repair and backfitting measures are documented in the report. Comparisons of capacity availability and capacity utilization clearly show the competitiveness of nuclear electricity also in a deregulated electricity market. Because of their favorable cost structures, all plants were operated largely in the baseload regime; following requests by their load dispatchers, some plants were run for some time in the load following and frequency stabilization regimes, respectively. The Technical Committee of VGB PowerTech e.V. has been a forum for exchanging operating experience of nuclear power plants for more than thirty years. Participants are operators of nuclear power plants in Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.									0	0	0	0	0	INFORUM VERLAGS-VERWALTUNGSGESELLSCHAFT MBH	BERLIN	ROBERT-KOCH-PLATZ 4, BERLIN, 10115, GERMANY	1431-5254			ATW-INT J NUCL POWER	ATW-Int.

The key objectives of the designs are flexibility to accommodate the different machine operating modes and parameter variations expected, minimization of global tritium inventory, and the use of robust, simple processing concepts to ensure longevity and ease of operation. The configuration of each of the systems has been frozen as a basis for a full investigation of the process performance, while the detailed mechanical and electrical design will be completed after site selection, as this may influence some details of the component selection and layout.

The plasma exhaust gas therefore needs to be processed in a way that a tritium removal efficiency of about 108 with respect to the flow rate is achieved. Expressed in terms of tritium concentrations this corresponds to a decontamination from about 130 gm(-3) down to about 10(-4) gm(-3) (about 1 Cim(-3) = 3.7*10(10) Bqm(-3)). The three step reference process for the TEP system of ITER is called CAPER and has been developed and realized at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK). After the successful commissioning of the PERMCAT reactor as the key component of the third step detailed parametric tritium testing of the 3 steps involving the processing of more than 300 g tritium has been carried out and decontamination factors beyond the design requirements have been demonstrated for each process step and for the process as a whole. Not only the decontamination factor of 10(8) as required by ITER, but also the operational mode of TEP as a waste dump for gases from diverse sources has been experimentally validated with the CAPER facility.

The plasma exhaust gas, therefore, needs to be processed with an overall tritium removal efficiency of about 10(8). Such a high decontamination factor can be achieved by multistage processes. The third step of the three step CAPER process developed at the TLK is based on a so-called permeator catalyst (PERMCAT) reactor, a direct combination of a Pd/Ag permeation membrane and a catalyst bed. In this work, a numerical simulation of the PERMCAT reactor was performed and the result was compared with experimental data.

Here, aging effects on pressure-composition isotherms of Pd(PtRh) solid solutions are investigated for tritium storage up to 5 years. The main changes observed are the decrease of the plateau pressures and the shift of the a and)6 branches towards greater stoichiometries, as it was already observed for pure palladium. In this study, we show that aging effects are greater on palladium substituted by platinum and/or rhodium than for pure palladium. These observations can be correlated to different evolutions of the structural and micro-structural properties of the solid solutions.

The central objective of this investigation was to study, for the first time in such an in-depth and parametric way, the interaction of tritium and tritiated gas mixtures with the panel and the influence on pumping performance and regeneration characteristics. This paper describes how the pump was implemented in the system and summarizes the major experimental results obtained in a two-staged programme: First, the test set-up was used to pump process gases under the Trace Tritium Campaign at JET; secondly, a dedicated test campaign was performed with defined external supply of tritium via a U-bed It is highlighted that the ITER cryosorption pumping concept achieves highest pumping speeds for tritium. No show-stoppers have been identified.

To develop this technology and to simulate tritium recirculation in RFNC-VNIIEF at the "Prometheus" setup the experiments on superpermeation of hydrogen isotopes through metal membrane were realized. The results of experiments on superpermeation of hydrogen isotopes through cylindrical niobium membrane are presented. As the experiment has shown, membrane pumping rate is inversely proportional to square root of isotope mass and amount to 2.5 l/cm(2)s for protium, 1.8 l/cm(2)s for deuterium and 1.5 l/cm(2)s for tritium. The possibility of effective pumping, separation of hydrogen isotopes from helium and residual gas, compression and recuperation of hydrogen isotopes by means of superpermeable membrane was demonstrated. It follows from results that the separation of D/T from He with employment of the techniques of superpermeable membranes might reduce the total amount of tritium in fuel cycle and substantially enhance the resource of cryogenic pumps evacuating helium.

J	Wykes, M				Wykes, M			Minimisation of the hydrogenic inventory of the ITER neutral beamline and torus cryo-sorption pumps	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 12-17, 2004	Baden Baden, GERMANY					The tritium inventory of all the ITER torus cryopumps open to the vacuum vessel has an administrative limit of 120 g, including tritium bound to hydrocarbon compounds formed by combination of fuel gas with carbon plasma-facing components. The total hydrogenic inventory of each of the torus cryopumps has to be less than that resulting in a deflagration pressure of 0.2 MPa (the design pressure of the ITER vacuum vessel of which the torus and neutral beam cryopump pressure boundaries are apart) following a hydrogen-air ignition. Since the neutral beamline fuelling is with protium and deuterium only, these pumps do not significantly contribute to the 120 g tritium limit. The hydrogenic inventories of both the torus and neutral beam cryopumps add to the total for the vacuum vessel following an in-vessel ingress of coolant from a failed water-cooled component, wherein hydrogen is produced from steam reacting with hot metallic dust. There is therefore a large incentive to keep the peak inventories of both the torus and neutral beamline cryopumps as low as practicable. The paper describes the regeneration patterns of the torus and neutral beamline cryopumps that are used to attain this goal while achieving the required vacuum conditions commensurate with the reference ITER pulse scenarios.

The tritium injector TPI -1 was developed at the PELIN Laboratory and put in operation in Russian Federal Nuclear Center. It is a part of an experimental closed circuit for simulation of ITER fuel cycle. Results of several continuous extrusions of solid rod made of various hydrogen isotopes are presented Transverse dimensions of an extruded ice rod with rectangular cross-section were similar to 3x4 center dot mm. The greatest extrusion velocity came to 15 mm/s for hydrogen and 9 mm/s for D-T mixture; tritium content in fuel mixture did not exceed 11%; pellet velocity ran up to 500 m/s at repetitive mode. An optimal mode of D-T ice extrusion was determined.

As a result, hydrogen could be extracted from mixed gases containing hydrogen, water vapor and methane. Furthermore, water vapor electrolysis for the tritium monitor was also evaluated under a wet atmosphere containing oxygen. From these results, it was revealed that a plated platinum electrode was suitable for mixed gases containing hydrogen, water vapor and methane, and that a porous pasted platinum electrode was suitable for water vapor electrolysis. From the findings obtained from the study of the hydrogen extraction properties, we described an optimum specification of the platinum electrode for a tritium recovery system and the number of proton-conducting ceramics for a tritium monitor.

The current reference process for the Tokamak Exhaust Process (TEP) system of ITER is called CAPER and consists of three different steps; the third step is based on counter current isotopic swamping to recover trace amounts of tritium in the so called PERMCAT For testing the efficiency of the PERMCAT tritium concentrations below 3.7*10(10) Bqm(-3) need to be measured in a process gas, challenging real time measurement, a wide measurement range of at least 4 orders of magnitude and low memory effects. The sampling technique used at TLK to measure the tritium concentration at the outlet of the PERMCAT is discussed in details with regards to memory effects.

J	Klein, JE				Klein, JE			Shell temperatures for a single-heater diffuser	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 12-17, 2004	Baden Baden, GERMANY					A new diffuser/permeator design has been proposed for a new Savannah River Site tritium project. The use of a single heaterwell in the center of the shell had raised concerns that the Pd/Ag coils may be shielding radiative heat transfer to the walls thus reducing Pd/Ag tube temperatures near the shell below the recommended minimum operating temperature. The diffuser was fitted with thermocouples to measure shell temperatures during testing. Tests were run with the shell evacuated, helium Feed flows of 0, 1000, and 2000 sccm; Bleed pressures ranging from 0 to 203 kPa, and heater temperatures of 650, 675, and 700 degrees C Hydrogen permeation tests were run with two hydrogen/helium mixtures and Feed rates to simulate 1st and 2nd stage diffuser operations. Approximately 20 hours were required to bring the diffuser from ambient temperature to steady-state conditions. For tests with a heater temperature of 675 degrees C and no hydrogen flow, helium flow rate and pressure had little impact on the measured shell temperatures, the thermowell temperature, roughly 415 degrees C, and altered heater output by only 11 watts. Conversely, controlling the thermowell temperature to 415 degrees C during hydrogen permeation tests increased heater power output, lowered heater temperature, and increased shell temperatures. The tests showed the diffuser can perform its intended function with reasonable assurance that the Pd/Ag tubes were within the recommended temperature range.

The validity of the CMSB was discussed through this experiment as an integrated system for the recovery of blanket tritium. A gas stream of hydrogen isotopes and He was supplied to the CMSB as the He sweep gas in blanket of a fusion reactor. After the breakthrough of tritium was observed, regeneration of the CMSB was carried out by evacuating and heating. The hydrogen isotopes were finally recovered by the diffuser. At first, only He gas was sent by the evacuating. The hydrogen isotopes gas was then rapidly released by the heating. The system worked well against the above drastic change of conditions. The amount of hydrogen isotopes gas finally recovered by the diffuser was in good agreement with that adsorbed by the CMSB. The dynamic behaviors (breakthrough and regeneration) of the system were explained well by a set of basic codes.

During plasma operation it is required that deuterium-tritium gases with well defined ratios of D/T are supplied by the different hydrogen storage beds. Due to the isotope effects the composition of the hydrogen gas mixture supplied by the getter bed may be different from the one absorbed in the getter and may even change during unloading of the bed depending on the variation of the isotope effect with the actual amount of hydrogen isotopes stored in the bed. At the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe a 1:1 prototype of ITER hydrogen storage bed with a capacity of 100 g tritium and a target supply rate of up to 200 Pam3s-1 was designed and manufactured. The getter bed is currently filled with zirconium-cobalt and is installed in an experimental rig coupled with a micro gas chromatograph in order to perform tests under different operation conditions and to characterize the possible isotope effects. In this work a first data on the isotope effect during loading and unloading of the getter bed with the different hydrogen-deuterium mixtures is presented.

A performance test was carried out to demonstrate that the TSV could hold a minimum of 500kCi of tritium. This experiment was conducted by a batch type hydriding reaction. Hydrogen gas equivalent to 50kCi of tritium was reacted with the titanium sponge in a batch reaction. Experimental results for 10 batches show that the TSV has enough capacity to store 500kCi of tritium.

Recently SRS has designed and built a new Pd/ kieselguhr flow through bed (FTB) prototype for separating tritium from other gases and simultaneously storing the tritium on palladium. The FTB prototype uses single-pass liquid nitrogen for cooling during tritium absorption/loading/storage and electrical heaters for desorption/unloading of tritium. Fourteen (14) hydrogen absorption/desorption or loading/ unloading cycles have been conducted with the new FTB prototype. Test results show that all design performance objectives have been successfully achieved recover >95% of hydrogen gas from feed gas, <5% hydrogen in discharge gas, and >99.9% hydrogen in the desorbed product gas. This paper will discuss the design and operation of the FTB, and results of performance tests such as separation efficiency, hydrogen/tritium storage capacity and temperature profiles during prep cooling, hydrogen loading and unloading.

J	Sessions, KL				Sessions, KL			Processing tritiated water at the Savannah River Site: A production-scale demonstration of a Palladium Membrane Reactor	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 12-17, 2004	Baden Baden, GERMANY					The Palladium Membrane Reactor (PAR) process was installed in the Tritium Facilities at the Savannah River Site to perform a production-scale demonstration for the recovery of tritium from tritiated water adsorbed on molecular sieve (zeolite). Unlike the current recovery process that utilizes magnesium, the PMR offers a means to process tritiated water in a more cost effective and environmentally friendly manner. The design and installation of the large-scale PMR process was part of a collaborative effort between the Savannah River Site and Los Alamos National Laboratory. The PMR process operated at the Savannah River Site between May 2001 and April 2003. During the initial phase of operation the PMR processed thirty-four kilograms of tritiated water from the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. The water was processed in fifteen separate batches to yield approximately 34,400 liters (STP) of hydrogen isotopes. Each batch consisted of round-the-clock operations for approximately nine days. In April 2003 the reactor's palladium-silver membrane ruptured resulting in the shutdown of the PMR process. Reactor performance, process performance and operating experiences have been evaluated and documented. A performance comparison between PMR and current magnesium process is also documented.

The development, i.e. configuration, design and performance testing of critical components, of a tritium recovery system based on the combination CECE - CD is essential for both JET and ITER. For JET, a Water Detritiation System (WDS) is not only needed to process tritiated water which has already been accumulated from operation, but also for the tritiated water which will be generated during decommissioning. For ITER, the WDS is one of the key systems to control the tritium content in the effluents streams, to recover as much tritium as possible and consequently to minimize the impact on the environment. A cryogenic distillation facility with the aim to investigate the trade-off between CECE-CD, to validate different components and mathematical modelling software is current under development at Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK) as an extension of the existing CECE facility.

Unlike the conventional hydrophilic catalysts, which becomes inefficient to direct contact with liquid water the hydrophobic catalysts kept a high catalytic activity and stability, even under the direct contact with liquid water or in presence of humid gas. Based on the long experience of the authors, in the preparation, testing and evaluation of the performances of hydrophobic catalysts, and based on the reviewed references, this paper presents up-to-date R&D activities on the preparation methods and applications of the hydrophobic catalysts, in tritium separation. The objectives of the paper are: (1) to provide a database for selection of the most appropriate catalyst and catalytic packing for above mentioned processes (2) to asses and to find a new procedure for preparation of a new improved hydrophobic catalyst. From reviewed references we consider that platinum remains the most active and efficient catalytic metal and the TEFLON is the best wet-proofing agent. A new improved hydrophobic Pt-catalyst has been proposed and is now underway. The main steps and experimental conditions of preparation are largely discussed A new wet-proofing agent and a new binding agents (titanium oxide, cerium oxide, zirconium oxide) with catalytic role are proposed and tested The physico-structural parameters of new improved catalyst have been determined and are discussed in details. The new proposal is a promising idea to improve the performances of conventional hydrophobic Pt-catalysts.

The key point of WDS is the efficiency and stability of liquid phase catalytic exchange (LPCE) column, that has to achieve a high decontamination of tritiated streams. Two catalytic mixed packing based on hydrophobic Pt-catalyst, and having closed separation performances have been proposed for LPCE column. A complete data base concerning the influence of beta-radiation of tritium and the influence of impurities from feed streams on the catalytic mixed packing's performances and parameters is absolutely necessary. The results of 3 months endurance test for one of these packing (SCK-CEN packing), are presented in this paper. No significant modifications of performances and physico-structural parameters have been observed.

One of the most important processes for tritium separation, is the catalyst isotope exchange water-hydrogen. Our catalytic package consists of Romanian patented catalysts with platinum on charcoal and polytetrafluoretylene (Pt/C/PTFE) and the ordered Romanian patented package B7 type. The catalytic package was tested in an isotope exchange facility for water detritiation at the Experimental Pilot Plant from ICIT Rm. Valcea. In a column of isotope exchange tritium is transferred from liquid phase (tritiated heavy water) in gaseous phase (hydrogen). In the experimental set-up, which was used, the column of catalytic isotope exchange is filled with successive layers of catalyst and ordered package. The catalyst consists of 95.5 wt.% of PTFE, 4.1 wt. % of carbon and 0.40 wt. % of platinum and was of Raschig rings 10x10x2 mm. The ordered package was B7 type consists of wire mesh phosphor bronze 4x1 wire and the mesh dimension is 0.18x0.48 mm. We analyzed the transfer phenomena of tritium from liquid to gaseous phase, in this system. The mass transfer coefficient which characterized the isotopic exchange on the package, were determined as function of experimental parameters.
