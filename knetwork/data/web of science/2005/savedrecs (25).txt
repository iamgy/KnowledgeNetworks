A new method is introduced to determine gamma dose rates due to soil 1 m above the ground through measurements performed deep in the soil. This allows evaluation of the soil component even in places where the measurement at 1 m height is influenced by other sources (mainly the presence of buildings). The methodology was tested in non-urbanized areas by comparing direct dose rate measurements in air with those deep in soil. In addition, high-resolution gamma ray spectrometry of soil samples collected throughout the city was used to determine the natural radionuclide concentrations, allowing the comparison with the in-situ dose rate results. Measurements deep in soil followed a log-normal distribution. The fitted geometric mean (median) and geometric standard deviation of the soil contribution to the ambient dose equivalent rate at 1 m height were, respectively, 80.9(6) and 0.642(4) nSv h(-1). Compared to previous data, these values show that. buildings enhance about 35% the outdoor gamma dose rate expected only from soil. The specific activities of Ra-226, Th-232, and K in dry soil, given by their medians, were, respectively, 41, 75, and 176 Bq kg(-1). These results reveal that the terrestrial gamma dose rates in Sao Paulo are higher than the world average, a fact that can be attributed to high thorium concentration. Direct measurements of dose rates were compared to the corresponding values determined from radionuclide concentrations in soil. Good agreement between methods was found.

The data of two case-control studies performed during 1990-1997 in Germany and used for previous publications have been extended and pooled. Both studies have identical study designs. In total, data of 2,963 incident lung cancer cases and 4,232 population controls are analyzed here. One-year radon measurements were performed in houses occupied during the 5-35 y prior to the interview. Conditional logistic and linear relative risk regression was used for the analysis. Measurements covered on average 70% of the exposure time window, with an average radon exposure of 61 Bq m(-3). The smoking and asbestos-adjusted ORs were 0.97 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.11] for 50-80 Bq m(-3), 1.06 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.30) for 80-140 Bq m(-3) and 1.40 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.89) for radon concentrations above 140 Bq m-3, compared to the reference category <50 Bq m-3. The linear increase in the odds ratio per 100 Bq m(-3) was 0.10 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.30) for all subjects and 0.14 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.55) for less mobile subjects who lived in only one home in the last 5-35 y. The risk coefficients generally were higher when measurement error in the radon concentrations was reduced by restricting the population. With respect to histopathology, the risk for small cell carcinoma was higher than for other subtypes. This analysis strengthens the evidence that residential radon is a relevant risk factor for lung cancer.

The concentrations of Ra-226, Th-132, and K-40 were 46.2, 28.4, and 137.4 Bq kg(-1), respectively, for cement brick; and 64.7, 48.7, and 161.3 Bq kg(-1), respectively, for cement plaster. The concentration of 226Ra, Th-232, and 4 K in cement ranges from 34.7 to 68.3 Bq kg(-1) with a mean value of 56.5 Bq kg(-1),18.5 to 51.7 Bq kg(-1) with a mean value of 36.5 Bq kg(-1), and 126.8 to 224.6 Bq kg(-1) with a mean value of 173.2 Bq kg(-1), respectively. The measured activity concentrations for these radionuclides were compared with the reported data of other countries. The radium equivalent activities (Ra-eq), external hazard index (Hex) and internal hazard index (Hi) associated with the radionuclides were calculated. The Raeq values of cement and cement products are lower than the limit of 370 Bq kg(-1), equivalent to a gamma dose of 1.5 mSv y(-1). The values of Hex and Hi are less than unity.

Flow diagrams show that the exergy content is mostly much less than the energy content of the flows. The largest exergy losses appear in the boilers. Heating processes are highly exergy inefficient. A limited Life Cycle Exergy Analysis (LCEA) shows that the exergy output amounts to over 3 times the spent exergy as non-sustainable resources. By replacing the present use of non-sustainable resources, mostly fuel oil, the mill could move towards a truly sustainable process. Copyright (C) 2005 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

Both zircon samples have suffered a similar degree of self-irradiation damage, as given by their degree of amorphization. X-ray diffraction measurements revealed that during the hydrothermal treatment only the disordered crystalline remnants recovered in the natural zircon, whereas in the Pu-238-doped zircon the amorphous phase strongly recrystallized. Such a different alteration behavior of natural and Pu-doped zircon is discussed in terms of two fundamentally different alteration mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that further experimental studies with Pu-doped zircon are required before any reliable prediction about the long-term aqueous stability of an actinide waste form based on zircon can be made.

Products formed by reacting unsintered as well as sintered UO2 with NaNO3 above 500degreesC were readily soluble in 2M HNO3, whereas ThO2 and PuO2 did not react with NaNO3 to form any soluble products. Thus reactions of mixed oxides (U, Th)O-2 and (U, Pu)O-2 with NaNO3 were carried out to study the quantitative separation of U from (U, Th)O-2 and (U, Pu)O-2. X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, thermal analysis and chemical analysis techniques were used for the characterization of the products formed during the reactions. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This suggests that irradiation defects act as hydrogen traps. The evidence of hydrogen trapping was investigated using the small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) method on four RPV steels. The samples were examined in the unirradiated and irradiated states and both in the as-received condition and after hydrogen charging. Despite the low bulk content of hydrogen achieved after charging with low current densities, an enrichment of hydrogen in small microstructural defects could be identified. Preferential traps were microstructural defects in the size range of approximate to > 10nm in the unirradiated and irradiated samples. However, the results do not show any evidence for hydrogen trapping in irradiation defects. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results are summarized as follows. (1) The weight change of the specimens and the amount of Co-60 deposition were strongly affected by the presence of H2O2. Weight gain of the specimens exposed to various H2O2 concentrations after a 200-h pre-exposure to 200 ppb H2O2 was less than 2 mu g/cm(2) for 1,000 h; this was caused by protection effects of thin and dense oxide film. (2) The amount of Co-60 deposition on the specimen exposed to 200ppb H2O2 was much less than the amounts of those exposed to 10, 5 and 0ppb H2O2 in the water with 50ppb H-2, but in the case of 200h-pre-exposure to 200ppb H2O2, the latter specimens had deposition amounts as low as that of the specimen exposed to 200ppb H2O2. (3) The amount of Co-60 deposition had a fairly linear correlation with the amount of outer oxide layer, except in the case of specimens exposed to the condition without H2O2 from the first. In the latter case, (CO)-C-60 was expected to be included in a Cr-rich inner oxide layer.

If possible, the analysis should be performed at high pH for species stability reasons. Differential pulse polarography using LiOH 0.1 mol(.)l(-1) as supporting electrolyte appeared to be a sensitive technique for the simultaneous analysis of the three compounds. The species electrochemical behaviours were studied independently and the chemical interactions were determined. Because of numerous interactions occurring between the species, analyses by the standard addition technique was excluded and rigorous operating conditions must be applied. Simultaneous analysis was performed by adding small amounts of sample in 10ml LiOH 0.1mol(.)l(-1) deaerated supporting electrolyte and using calibrations curves.

The aim was to investigate the migration behavior of anthropogenic radionuclides (Sr-90, (137)cs, and (239+240)pu) in the sea. Four expeditions conducted in the Japan Sea between 2001 and 2002 found that the observed concentrations and distributions of radionuclides were similar to those found in previous investigations. Inventories estimated from the concentration data indicate that larger amounts of these radionuclides accumulate in the Japan Sea seawater (by a factor of 1.5-2.1) than are supplied by global fallout in the same latitude belt. Further, we found that the Sr-90 and (CS)-C-137 concentrations in the intermediate layer show temporal variations with time scales of I to several years. The results of cross-analysis using the data of Cs-137 and dissolved oxygen suggest that the distribution and variation of radionuclide concentrations in the intermediate layer may reflect water mass movement in the upper part of the Japan Sea.

Two types of 9Cr martensitic and 12Cr ferritic ODS steel claddings were manufactured in JNC, and the upper end-plugs were welded by the pressurized resistance method. In the RIAR fuel production facility, the MOX and UO2 granulated fuels as well as uranium metal getter particles were vibro-packed into the ODS steel cladding. The lower end-plug was welded by the TIG end-face method. The inspection and quality control of the fabricated ODS fuel pins were done through X-ray analysis, gamma scanning, and leak testing etc. and it was confirmed the fuel pins satisfied the BOR-60 requirements. Those fuel pins were loaded into two dismountable experimental assemblies, and irradiation was started in the BOR-60 from June 26, 2003. The cladding middle wall temperature was kept within 700 +/- 20 degrees C and 650 +/- 20 degrees C. Currently, the attained burnup is 5 at.%. Toward the target burnup of 15 at.%, interim examinations will be made at intervals of 5 at.%.

The purposes of this study are to confirm the destruction performance of the two-stage MSO reactor system for the organic ion-exchange resin and to obtain an understanding of the behavior of the fixed toxic metals and the sulfur in the cationic exchange resins. The destruction of the organics is very efficient in the primary reactor. The primarily destroyed products such as carbon monoxide are completely oxidized in the secondary MSO reactor. The overall collection of the sulfur and metals in the two-stage MSO reactor system appeared to be very efficient. Over 99.5% of all the fixed toxic metals (lead and cadmium) and radioactive metal surrogates (cesium, cobalt, strontium) remained in the MSO reactor bottom. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations and the XRD patterns of the spent salt samples revealed that the collected metals existed in the form of each of their carbonates or oxides, which are non-volatile species at the MSO system operating conditions.

J	Dry, DE; Bauer, E; Petersen, LA				Dry, DE; Bauer, E; Petersen, LA			Rapid separation of fresh fission products	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Methods and Applications of Radioanalytical Chemistry	APR 07-11, 2003	Kailua Kona, HI					The fission of highly enriched uranium (HEU) by thermal neutrons creates dozens of isotopic products. The Isotope and Nuclear Chemistry Group participates in programs that involve analysis of "fresh" fission products by beta counting following radiochemical separations. This is a laborious and time-consuming process that can take several days to generate results. Gamma-spectroscopy can provide a more immediate path to isotopic activities, however, short-lived, high-yield isotopes can swamp a gamma-spectrum, making difficult the identification and quantification of isotopes on the wings and valley of the fission yield curve. The gamma-spectrum of a sample of newly produced fission products is dominated by the many emissions of a very few high-yield isotopes. Specifically, Te-132 (T-1/2 = 3.2 d), its daughter, I-132 (T-1/2 = 2.28 h), Ba-140 (T-1/2 = 12.75 d), and its daughter La-140 (T-1/2 = 1.68 d) emit at least 18 gamma-rays above 100 keV that are greater than 5% abundance. Additionally, the 1596 keV emission from La-140 imposes a Compton background that hinders the detection of isotopes that are neither subject to matrix dependent fractionation nor gaseous or volatile precursors. Some of these isotopes of interest are Ag-111, Cd-115, and the rare earths, (SM)-S-153, Eu-154, Eu-156, and Tb-160. C-INC has performed an HEU irradiation and also "cold" carrier analyses by ICP-AES to determine methods for rapid and reliable separations that may be used to detect and quantify low-yield fission products by gamma-spectroscopy. Results and progress are presented.

Since the isotope is transferred into the active root, it is possible to investigate where the growth occurs in the soil profile. The distribution of radioactivity in the root system is measured by means of an automatic detection equipment controlled by a portable PC. The design of the detection probe is discussed and its field use is surveyed. The whole instrumentation is compact and can easily be used to study the effects of irrigation and fertilization on crops growing under field conditions. The results obtained in the field tests show how the levels of nutrients and moisture influence the root development.

The TRU-ES resin is comprised of an inert macroporous polystyrene core impregnated with the organic floors [diphenyloxazole (PPO) and 1,4-bis-(4-methyl-5-phenyl-2oxazolyl)benzene (DM-POPOP)) and the selective extract (octyl(phenyl)-N, N-diisobutyl-carbamoylmethylphosphine oxide (CMPO) in tri-butyl phosphate (TBP)]. The TRU-ES resin, packed into translucent FEP Teflon tubing, was placed into a flow-cell scintillation detection system. Acidified aqueous solutions, U-233 spiked synthetic ground water and EPA natural uranium QA samples, were pumped through the flow-cell while gross count rate and pulse-height spectra were collected. The increase in count rate is attributed to the uranium being extracted from the aqueous medium and retained by the TRU-ES resin with simultaneous detection of the resultant scintillation photons. The TRU-ES loading efficiency was nearly quantitative out of 2M HNO3 with a flow rate of 0.5 ml.min(-1). The detection efficiency was measured to be 51% for 233U. The detection limit was determined to be similar to2 Bq.l(-1) for 233U based on a resin free column volume of 0.2 ml, and 50 ml of 2M HNO3 acidified groundwater.

High temperature chemical filters are used to separate volatile products. The approach has demonstrated its efficiency in a number of examples of carrier-free isotope production from targets irradiated at an accelerator: Cd-109 from In; Na-22 from Al; Se-72 from GaAs; Pt-188, Re-183, Os-185 and Tl-201 from Pb or Bi; separation of Po from Pb and Bi, etc. Another application of high temperature chemical sublimation of elements and oxides was realized in activation analysis of noble metals in various ores and samples.

This new radiotracer method has been applied to the study of 10 food samples and their corresponding recycled paper and board packaging. Samples of paper and board were irradiated in a thermal neutron flux of 1.26.10(16) n.m(-2).s(-1) for 15 hours to activate elements of interest. After a decay period of 10 days the paper and board was placed in contact with the corresponding foodstuff. The food was analyzed for any radioactivity migrating from the packaging by gamma-ray spectrometry. Samples were analyzed regularly during the 90 days contact time. Detection limits for the determination of migration was as low as a few mug/kg in the food. Results from the migration study have shown that, of the 60 elements measured, only Zn and Fe were detected in food, at concentrations of 0.012-0.25, and 0.045-0.11 mg/kg, respectively. This was despite the recycled paper and board samples being highly elevated in many other elements such as Cr (0.9-15.1 mg/kg) and Ba (3.3-75.4 mg/kg). The level of migration of Zn and Fe into food from packaging was insignificant compared to the UK recommended daily allowances of 15 mg, and, therefore, represented no hazard to human health.

J	Bonardi, ML; de Goeij, JJM				Bonardi, ML; de Goeij, JJM			How do we ascertain specific activities in no-carrier-added radionuclide preparations?	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Methods and Applications of Radioanalytical Chemistry	APR 07-11, 2003	Kailua Kona, HI				TARGET EXCITATION-FUNCTIONS; PROTON ACTIVATION-ANALYSIS; QUALITY-CONTROL; RADIOCHEMICAL SEPARATION; NUCLEAR-REACTIONS; IRRADIATION; PLATINUM; OPTIMIZATION; RADIOTRACERS; CYCLOTRON	In nuclear and radiochemistry the concepts of specific activity, radioactive concentration, isotopic and non-isotopic carrier, carrier-free and no-carrier-added are of paramount relevance. In fact, traces of carrier are easily introduced in the radioactive preparations by their presence in the target material, by equipment and chemicals used in target processing, and may also be produced by side nuclear reactions induced in the target by nuclear activation, sometimes followed by a decay chain. Very sensitive analytical and radioanalytical techniques allow the determination of the real value of specific activity of no-carrier-added radionuclides and labeled compounds. Thus, in this paper we show with several examples that in most practical cases the term carrier-free (CF) is used improperly and has to be substituted by the more suitable term no-carrier-added (NCA). Carrier-free radionuclides and labeled compounds do exist in a few selected cases only.

Pu(VI) sorption was determined to be rapid with equilibrium attained in 2 hours. Equilibrium experiments indicated sorption to be pH dependent with distribution constants, log K-d values, ranging from 4.11 at pH 6 to 5.92 at pH 8.5. Data collected at pH 8.0 with varying total Pu(VI) were fit to the Langmuir isotherm and yielded Langmuir constants of C-a = 0.0147 mole/mole and K = 1.71.10(8) I/mole. Although varying ionic strength did not have an effect on Pu(VI) sorption, a decrease in sorption was evident at high calcium and phosphate concentrations.

The Nuclear and Radiochemistry in Chemistry Education (NRIChEd) Curriculum Project was undertaken to reintroduce the topics normally covered in a one-semester radiochemistry course into the traditional courses of a four-year chemistry major: general chemistry, organic chemistry, quantitative and instrumental analysis, and physical chemistry. NRIChEd uses a three-pronged approach that incorporates radiochemistry topics when related topics in the basic courses are covered, presents special topics of general interest as a vehicle for teaching nuclear and radiochemistry alongside traditional chemistry, and incorporates the use of non-licensed amounts of radioactive substances in demonstrations and student laboratory experiments. This approach seeks not only to reestablish nuclear science in the chemistry curriculum, but to use it as a tool for elucidating fundamental and applied aspects of chemistry as well. Moreover, because of its relevance in many academic areas, nuclear science enriches the chemistry curriculum by encouraging interdisciplinary thinking and problem solving.

While MU had a viable radiochemistry program through existing faculty expertise and the utilization of the Missouri University Research Reactor, the REAP award allowed MU to leverage its resources in significantly expanding capabilities in radiochemistry. Specifically, the grant enabled the: (1) hiring of a new faculty member in actinide radiochemistry (Dr. Paul Duval); (2) support of six graduate students in radiochemistry; (3) purchase of new radiochemistry laboratory equipment; (4) more extensive collaboration with DOE scientists through interactions with faculty and graduate students, and (5) revised radiochemical curriculum (joint courses across disciplines and new courses in actinide chemistry). The most significant impact of this award has been in encouraging interdisciplinary education and research. The proposal was initiated by a joint effort between Nuclear Engineering and Chemistry, but also included faculty in biochemistry, radiology, and molecular biology. Specific outcomes of the REAP grant thus far are: (1) increased educational and research capabilities in actinide chemistry (faculty hire and equipment acquisition); (2) increased integration of biochemistry and radiochemistry (e.g., radiochemical analysis of uranium speciation in biological systems); (3) stronger interdisciplinary integration of molecular biology and radiochemical sciences (alpha-emitters for treating cancer); (4) new and more extensive interactions with national laboratory facilities (e.g., student internships at LANL and LLBL, faculty and lab scientist exchange visits, analytical measurements and collaboration with the Advanced Photon Source), and (7) new research funding opportunities based on REAP partnership.

These high-resolution detectors can assist in the rapid determination of uranium isotopic content of illicit material. Spectra were recorded from these "room temperature" semiconductor detectors with a portable multi-channel analyzer, both in the laboratory and in a field environment. Both detectors were operated below ambient temperature using the vendor supplied thermoelectric coolers. Both detectors had nominally the same active volume (18 mm(3) for the CdZnTe and 25 mm(3) for the CdTe detector) and resolution (i.e., <1.0 keV resolution FWHM at 59.5 keV). Spectra of samples of known isotopic content were recorded at fixed geometries. An evaluation of potential signature gamma-rays for the detection of enriched uranium was completed. Operational advantages and disadvantages of each detector are discussed.

This work entails coupling an Aerosol-to-Liquid Particle Extraction System (ALPES) to an electrochemically modulated separation (EMS) cell. The ALPES collects and concentrates airborne particles into a liquid,(1) and the EMS cell separates species based on their affinity for a charged target surface.(2) Preliminary data indicates substantial sensitivity enhancement may be realized by interfacing these devices. The system will allow for rapid field analysis of radionuclides while providing reductions in labor, cost, and turnaround time compared to standard radiometric techniques.

The current analytical methods involve separation chemistry and alpha-spectrometry for isotopic measurements or kinetic phosphorescence analysis for total uranium. There are several areas where this monitoring can be improved (e.g., analysis times and accurate isotopic ratio measurements). In addition, in case of accidents or exposure to people who are not routinely monitored, the optimum window for collecting bioassay samples may be missed. An example of this scenario is the recent concern over the exposure of civilians to depleted uranium from military ammunition in Kosovo and Kuwait. For these cases, hair may be an alternative bioassay. Analytical procedures utilizing an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) have been developed that have simplified sample processing and improved the isotopic ratio measurements. The focus of this study is to survey the background levels for U-235, U-236, U-238, and Th-232 isotopes in hair, urine, and drinking water which could be used to determine action levels for follow-up monitoring. In addition, variations of U-238 to U-235 mass ratio for the background samples are measured. The analytical procedures, achieved detection limits, observed background distributions, and the results of uranium isotope ratio tests are presented.

This ratio varies from 1.5 to 1.9 due to natural causes. The results point to the lack of the technogenic uranium along the Naryn River through territory of the Kyrgyz Republic and to the contamination of the Mailuu-Suu River by technogenic uranium from tailing dumps in the area. The share of technogenic uranium transported to Uzbekistan does not exceed 30%, and the total uranium content is considerably lower than the maximum admissible concentration (MAC) and is almost an order of magnitude lower than that of potable waters of the Chui Valley of Kyrgyz Republic.

The experiment, named Navruz (meaning "new beginning"), uses standardized methods to monitor basic water quality parameters, radionuclides, and metals in the Syr Darya and Amu Darya rivers. Overall, the project addresses three main goals: (1) to help increase capabilities in Central Asian nations for sustainable water resources management; (2) to provide a scientific basis for supporting nuclear transparency and non-proliferation in the region; and (3) to help reduce the threat of conflict in Central Asia over water resources. Contamination of these rivers is a result of growing population, urbanization, agricultural uses, and radioactive and metals contamination from a legacy of uranium mining, industry, and other activities of the former Soviet Union. The project focuses on waterborne radionuclides and metals because of the importance of these contaminants to public health and political stability in Central Asia. Moreover, the method of enabling scientists from bordering countries to study a transboundary problem, can lead to a greater scientific understanding, consensus on necessary mitigation steps, and ultimately the political resolution of the issue. The project scope, approach, and preliminary results are presented.

The original purpose of airborne radiation mapping in Finland was to identify hazardous areas containing radioactive fall-out after a nuclear accident or use of nuclear weapons. Regular exercises are held annually to keep the operational functionality at a high level. The achieved capability has been well demonstrated in international INEX-2-FIN 1997 and Barents Rescue 2001 exercises. The knowledge and competence achieved can easily be applied in international radiation monitoring campaigns designed to expose undeclared nuclear materials or other clandestine nuclear activities. The essential improvements in the detection system are linked to the ability to locate point-like radiation sources rather than large areas of fall-out. This paper describes the aerial gamma-ray measurement method and its usability for the detection of nuclear material production chains and trails of fission or activation products. The ability of airborne detection systems in revealing the use of undeclared nuclear materials has been tested. Various scenarios for exposing clandestine nuclear material production, enrichment and nuclear waste trails have been considered. Based on detection capability calculations and testing in practice, it was found that the detection of one un-shielded significant quantity of natural uranium (10 tons of yellow cake in storage barrels) is possible through the daughter products, using one single 6"x4" NaI detector on the airplane. The developed fixed wing gamma measurement technique is now able to detect significant amounts of nuclear material conveniently and cost-effectively. Large areas can be screened to identify suspicious sub-areas for more detailed ground-based inspection.

In an automated usage mode, spectra that are received via e-mail are processed into a directory tree, analyzed with UNISAMPO and SHAMAN, and finally categorized on the basis of the analysis results. Alarms are generated if anything out of the ordinary is observed. Typical applications for an air filter analysis pipeline are national radioactivity surveillance networks and the global radionuclide monitoring network being implemented for verification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). Our analysis pipeline system has been used by the Finnish national CTBT-authority, the Finnish National Data Center (FiNDC), since July 1999. Evaluation with a randomly selected set of 1518 air filter spectra showed that our pipeline system produces significantly better analysis results than that utilized by the CTBT Organization (CTBTO): our system found 4.2 more peaks per spectrum than the CTBTO system (9% increase) and identified 5.6 more peaks per spectrum (14% increase) on the average.

J	Smith, DK; Williams, RW				Smith, DK; Williams, RW			The dynamic movement of plutonium in an underground nuclear test with implications for the contamination of groundwater	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							NEVADA TEST-SITE; MIGRATION	The recent discovery of the migration of plutonium in groundwater away from underground nuclear tests at the Nevada Test Site has spawned considerable interest in the mechanisms by which plutonium may be released to the environment by a nuclear explosion. A suite of solid debris samples was collected during drilling through an expended test cavity and the overlying collapse chimney. Uranium and plutonium were analyzed for isotope ratios and concentrations using high precision magnetic sector inductively coupled mass spectrometry. The data unequivocally shows that plutonium may be dispersed through out the cavity and chimney environment at the time of the detonation. The Pu-239/Pu-240 ratios are also fractionated relative to initial plutonium isotope ratio for the test device. Fractionation is the result of the volatilization of uranium and production of Pu-239 by the reaction U-238 (n,gamma). We conclude that for the test under consideration plutonium was deposited outside of the confines of the cavity by dynamic processes in early-time and it is this plutonium that is most likely transferred to the groundwater regime.

To investigate this situation experiments involving several groups of Cobb broilers was performed. Two animals per group were sacrificed weekly up to their adultness and uranium concentration in the tibia was measured. It was observed that the concentration of uranium (mug U/g bone) is decreasing all along the animal life spanning period of 14-42 days. This behavior suggests that the skeleton mass is growing faster than the corresponding accumulation of uranium. The administration of phytase seems not to alter this scenario.

By utilizing polymer thin films with high affinity for actinides, we have been able to selectively concentrate actinides of interest upon the diode surface, resulting in a substantial increase in sensitivity relative to a direct measurement. With this film coated diodes, we were able to obtain in-situ alpha spectra with energy resolution comparable to that of conventional alpha-spectroscopy. The response of the thin film coated diode was found to be linear over 10(4). The sensitivity and reversibility is a function of the membrane complexation chemistry.

J	Elliston, JT; Glover, SE; Filby, RH				Elliston, JT; Glover, SE; Filby, RH			Comparison of direct kinetic phosphorescence analysis and recovery corrected kinetic phosphorescence analysis for the determination of natural uranium in human tissues	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							NEUTRON-ACTIVATION ANALYSIS; PLASMA-MASS-SPECTROMETRY; BIOLOGICAL-MATERIALS; ALPHA-SPECTROMETRY; SOLVENT-EXTRACTION; ISOTOPES; THORIUM; URINE; BODY; DIET	In the analysis of biological samples with sub ng/g uranium concentrations, pre-concentration has been shown to improve the detection limit for the determination of uranium. Recovery corrected kinetic phosphorescence analysis (KPA) combines pre-concentration and separation of uranium by anion-exchange from human tissues dissolved in 6M HCl, with the radiochemical yield determined by alpha-spectrometry, using U-232 as a tracer. Total uranium is determined by KPA after correction for chemical recovery. Twenty-one randomly selected dissolved tissue samples from the United States Transuranium and Uranium Registries (USTUR) Case 0242 were chosen for comparative analyses. The set of samples included dissolved bone and soft tissues. Uranium concentrations for seven of the samples had not been previously reported. Direct KPA could not be used to determine uranium concentrations of five unreported tissues. Three of these tissues had uranium concentrations at or below the KPAL(Q) value of 0.028 ng/ml and two tissues had known matrix interferences. All seven of the unreported tissues were success fully analyzed by recovery corrected KPA; concentrations ranged from 9 to 1380 ng per tissue, including those that could not be analyzed by direct KPA due to matrix problems. Recovery corrected KPA gives results similar to direct KPA where matrix interferences and low detection limits are not encountered. A comparison of the direct method of KPA versus recovery corrected KPA shows marked improvement for the determination of uranium in samples that heretofore either uranium was not detected or the sample had to be drastically diluted to minimize matrix effects in order to measure uranium.

J	Frechou, C; Degros, JP				Frechou, C; Degros, JP			Measurement of Cl-36 in nuclear wastes and effluents: Validation of a radiochemical protocol with an in-house reference sample	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							CHLORINE-36; WATERS; I-129	Cl-36 is a beta-emitter with a very low specific activity. It is produced during the irradiation of nuclear fuel, in the reactor core of power plants, from neutron capture by stable Cl-35 that may be present at trace level in any part of the irradiated material. Due to its long half-life (T-1/2 = 3.01 (.) 10(5) y), Cl-36 may be significant in impact assessment studies of disposal sites of nuclear wastes. Considering these different elements, the National Radioactive Waste Management Agency (Andra-France) requests information on the Cl-36 content of the waste packages destined to be stored at Andra sites. As for other halogens, the measurement of Cl-36 is a difficult analytical task in view of its potential losses during the different chemical steps and also because of the lack of international certified reference material needed to validate the chemical and measurement procedures. This paper describes the methodology processed to constitute an in-house solid reference sample with a known content of stable and radioactive chlorine. The original radiochemistry developed to extract Cl-36 from solid samples and purify it before a liquid scintillation counting is explained. The comparison of the results given by this radiochemical protocol and other methods allow its validation. The replication of the measurements on the constituted reference materials gives a repeat ability around 8% at a confidence level of 95% that is very close to the calculated combined uncertainty value.

The minerals used in this study are referred to as "resistates" because of their resistance to natural weathering processes.(1) It is also known that there are some resistate minerals that have a tendency to contain uranium and thorium within their crystal structure. These resistates can contain as much as 15-20% of the total uranium and thorium present in the soil.(9) Do resistates dissolve in acids, particularly in the HF/HNO3 procedures, if not what can be done to the HF/HNO3 process to dissolve more of the resistate minerals? How would these acid techniques compare to the fusion method used for mineral dissolution? Could the resistate minerals contain considerable amount of uranium and thorium? These were the questions addressed in this research. The comparative data indicate that the use of H2SO4 in the dissolution process resulted in similar to25% overall increase in the minerals dissolving therefore resulting in a higher yield of extracted uranium and thorium.

Cs-137 concentrations in the present water columns (>0.2 Bq(.)m(-3)) were determined using sample volumes of around 10 liters by the AMP precipitation method and ground-level gamma-spectrometry at the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI). Equipment at the Ogoya Underground Laboratory (OUL) is able to achieve very low radioactivity measurements. As a result, we are able to measure Cs-137 concentrations in deep waters (100-1500 m) in 1957, of about 1 Bq(.)m(-3) from a small volume (250 ml) of the archived samples. The high sensitive Cs-137 measurements allow effectively using Cs-137 as a tracer of water motion in the ocean.

In this paper, the requirements for a mass spectrometry system for measuring extremely low concentrations of rare atoms are discussed and these requirements are illustrated using the details of the AMS analysis of I-129. As an example of an application of this AMS technology, a series of I-129 measurements, used to identify isolated events in which radioactivity has been atmospherically transported into the Arctic, is described. Such investigations could not be carried out without the small sample size capability of AMS analysis.

The average Pu-240/Pu-239 atom ratio in the samples collected in Colorado was determined to be 0.165+/-0.008. A limited number of samples were collected at various locations in the Arctic at approximately 70degrees N latitude. Analyses of these samples predict that the Pu-240/Pu-239 atom ratio in environmental samples collected at 70degrees N latitude at locations only containing fallout is 0.183+/-0.009. These results provide data that help to precisely define the Pu-240/Pu-239 atom ratios representative of global fallout at the two locations studied.

The procedures include aggressive dissolution, separation by anion-exchange resin, separation and purification by extraction chromatography (e.g., TRU, TEVA and UTEVA resins) with measurement of the radionuclides by semiconductor alpha-spectrometry (SAS). Anion-exchange has proved to be a strong tool to treat large volume samples, and extraction chromatography shows an excellent selectivity and reduction of the amounts of acids. The results of the analysis of uranium, thorium, plutonium and americium isotopes by this method in marine samples (IAEA-384, -385 and -414) provided excellent agreement with the recommended values with good chemical recoveries.
