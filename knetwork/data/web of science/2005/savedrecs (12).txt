A laboratory scale setup of glass made apparatuses was established in such a way that it allows us to study phase and catalytic exchange apart. A computer model of the set-up has been developed. The catalytic isotope exchange model formulation is presented. A collection of reversible chemical reactions is accompanied by diffusion of the gaseous reactants and reaction products in the pores of catalyst carrier. This has some interesting features that are demonstrated Thus it was noted that the flow rates ratio (gas to vapour - lambda = G / V) as well as the concentrations of reactants exert influence on the process efficiency.

As an improvement of the CECE process, we have developed a reduced-pressure method as a means of enhancing the separation factor. The feasibility of this method is examined through application to a CECE process using a prototype separation column. Hydrogen-deuterium isotope separation experiments are performed in the two cases where column pressures are 12 and 101 kPa, and the separation factors for hydrogen and deuterium are obtained as 6 8 and 5.6, respectively. It is confirmed that the present method is applicable and useful to the CECE process. The values of Height Equivalent to a Theoretical Plate (HETP) are estimated by analyses with the equilibrium stage model. The HETP values are 15 cm at 12 kPa and 13 cm at 101 kPa. The increase of superficial velocity with decreasing pressure may spoil the efficiency of the mass transfer.

The separation mechanism was analyzed as the hydrogen isotope exchange reaction between water and diatomic hydride that consists of hydrogen and cathode material. The equilibrium constants of the isotope exchange reaction were calculated from reduced partition function ratio. Using the constants, the separation factor (SF) of the isotopes was calculated according to the two-phase distribution theory for isotopes. Experimentally, light or heavy water spiked with tritiated water was electrolyzed by a device with a solid polymer electrolyte, which equipped with SUS, Ni, or carbon cathode. Thus, the SFs were experimentally obtained. Calculated SFs were well agreed with the experimentally values for SUS and Ni cathodes, and that for carbon cathode was somewhat small then the experimental value.

The height of the distillation tower depends on the height equivalent to a theoretical plate, HETP and the equilibrium isotope separation factor, alpha(H-T)(equi). The adsorption action improved not only HETP but also alpha(H-T)(equi). Since the adsorption-distillation method proposed here can shorten the tower height with keeping advantages of the distillation, it may bring an excellent way for miniaturizing the distillation tower to detritiate a large amount of waste water from fusion reactors.

The formula agrees with the experimental isotherms for H-2 and D-2 on the zeolites. Adsorption of H-2-D-2 and H-2-HD-D-2 mixtures on the same adsorbents is experimentally examined. The experiments are performed using a volumetric apparatus and a quadra-pole-type mass spectrograph. The experimental adsorption behavior of H-2, D2 and HD shows agreement of separation factors with results calculated according to the ideal adsorbed solution theory describing multi-component behavior, where the equilibrium isotherms estimated for H-2, HD and D-2 are used. Based on the theoretical adsorption model, the multi-component behavior of HT, DT and T-2 is predicted here.

TnT TCAP is an alternative design which uses a liquid to thermally cycle the metal hydride packed column. Inert gas displacement tests and deuterium pulse tests have been performed on the TnT TCAP column. The inert gas displacement tests are designed to measure plug flow in the column while the deuterium pulse tests determine the separation ability of the column.

Breakthrough behavior of D-2 in a H-2-D-2 mixture flowing through a synthetic zeolite 5A-type packed-bed column at 77.4 K is examined by using a cryogenic PSA apparatus. The test column used is 40 mm inner diameter It is filled with spherical adsorbent particles of 2 mm at an amount of 700 g on a dry basis. The hydrogen mixture including D-2 at a concentration of 1% is used in this experiment. The breakthrough curves obtained by the experiments are accurately simulated by theoretical curves calculated for the system exhibiting the Henry type adsorption. Overall effective mass transfer coefficients are obtained from the comparison of experimental curves with analytical ones. The coefficients increase monotonously with superficial velocity. The sequential operations of PSA, such as adsorption, desorption and pressurization is carried out for several times. It is confirmed that breakthrough curves are reproducible after several repetitions of operation.

In most of the present-day simulation methods a distillation column is assumed to be composed of theoretical stages, or plates. However, in the case of a multicomponent mixture theoretical plate does not exist. An alternative kinetic method of simulation is depicted in the work. According to this method a system of mass-transfer differential equations is solved numerically. Mass-transfer coefficients are estimated with using experimental results and empirical equations. Developed method allows calculating the steady state of a distillation column as well as its any non-steady state when initial conditions are given. The results for steady states are compared with ones obtained via Thiele-Geddes theoretical stage technique and the necessity of using kinetic method is demonstrated Examples of a column startup period and periodic distillation simulations are shown as well.

Low-oxygen and low-moisture waste gas containing nitrogen, helium or argon is pre-conditioned by the St909 getter prior to tritium stripping and discharge to the environment. SRS has recently built and tested a full-scale St909 Prototype Getter Bed to replace an existing design. The Bed was activated, loaded with nitrogen and tested for effectiveness in gettering oxygen and cracking water, methane and carbon dioxide at two temperatures, three pressures and three flow rates (residence times). Tests have been conducted using carrier gases of nitrogen and helium. This paper will discuss the new St909 getter bed design and test results.

To assess this option several stainless steel 316 specimens, previously loaded at elevated temperatures with 0.8-8.5 MBq of tritium, were flushed continuously with dry argon (water partial pressure 0.073 Pa) for extended periods of time. The released tritium (more than 99% in the form of tritiated water (HTO)) was collected in bubblers and monitored periodically by liquid scintillation counting. After an initial fast liberation a fairly constant rate of the order of 0.2% per day established. Tritium depth profile in the SS specimens could be simulated by a diffusion limited desorption model. The rate determining step for tritium release appears to be bulk diffusion.

Instead of measuring tritium, we propose to measure the production rate of the decay product: He-3. The amount of tritium enclosed inside a waste drum can be determined with an adapted He-3 ingrowth method that takes into account the leak rate of the drum. The model leads to different ways to quantify tritium in the drum. It is confirmed using reference drums that measuring the 3He leak by confining the drum during its equilibrium state gives the same result as sampling the drum atmosphere at the beginning of the storage. For each method, the appropriate apparatus, experimental procedures and calculation of tritium activity from mass spectrometric He-3 measurements are detailed. Performances of these techniques are studied and discussed. In addition, we describe a novel and fully automated apparatus based on the confinement method that makes it possible to achieve a close tritium inventory of all the waste drums stored or produced at CEA Valduc.

The experimental method that we are studying is a complete two-stage combustion with thermal and catalytic oxidation of the organic liquid into tritiated water for further treatment and tritium free off gases for discharge. Our first task involved the treatment of about 200 liters of tritiated organic solvent, with a total activity of around 17 TBq. We were able to completely treat this solvent with only limited discharges to the environment. The second application of this technology was a study to treat tritiated organic liquids from the Joint European Torus (JET). We started with cold tests using virgin and inactive oil and liquid scintillation cocktail. As a final step, batches of tritiated feedstock were treated to demonstrate the viability of the process and facility. We conclude that our technology is both technically feasible and safe and can be adapted for the treatment of various categories of problematic tritiated liquid waste, which will undoubtedly be produced in existing installations and in future fusion reactors.

From waste management point of view, it is necessary to know as accurately as possible the tritium inventory in such materials before disposal. Moreover the knowledge of tritium species (HTO or HT...) is also a significant information in case of detritiation prior to storage, since countries regulation already limit tritium contents and releases. There are three different strategies for tritiated waste management. The first one consists in a storage with confinment packages the second one is waiting for radioactive decay. The third one consists in the application of detritiation processes. Studies have been performed to determine different processes that could be used for tritium removal. The aim of this paper was, to study, at laboratory scale, different procedures which may be used for stainless steels and carbon materials detritiation. Thermal detritiation kinetics till 1300 K has been studied under various atmospheres; full chemical dissolution of samples has also been performed both for steel and graphite, this to perfectly know the tritium content in such matrices. Finally a study of tritium content in steel layers has also been made, to learn about the tritium behaviour. All results are given, allowing the possibility to take a decision either for detritiation procedure or storage conditions. The main result is that thermal out-gassing enables higher than 95% tritium extraction from the bulk at temperature in the range of 600K, without any material destruction under Hytec gas (Ar + 5% volume H-2).

The motivational force for tritium decontamination by chemical, physical, mechanical, or a combination of these methods, is driven by two underlying forces. The first of these motivational forces is safety. Safety is paramount to the established culture associated with fusion energy. The second of these motivational forces is cost. In all aspects, less tritium contamination equals lower operational and disposal costs. This paper will discuss and evaluate the various processes employed for tritium removal and decontamination.

This was needed as part of the decontamination and decommissioning associated with the Tritium Systems Test Assembly at Los Alamos National Laboratory. In particular, the disposal path for three, large tanks would vary substantially depending on the tritium inventory in the stainless steel walls. For this purpose the time-dependant diffusion equation was solved using previously measured parameters. These results were compared to previous work that measured the tritium inventory in the stainless steel wall of a 50-L tritium container. Good agreement was observed These results are reduced to a simple algebraic equation that can readily be used to estimate tritium inventories in room temperature stainless steel based on tritium partial pressure and exposure time. Results are available for both constant partial pressure exposures and for varying partial pressures. Movies of the time dependant results were prepared which are particularly helpful for interpreting results and drawing conclusions.

During the lifetime of PETRA the glove box became contaminated with a small amount of tritium but the source has not been positively identified. Removing large redundant components would be hazardous as this would require removing the glove box panels and thus exposing the inner surfaces to moist air which would release tritium. Over several months defined amounts of water have been introduced into the glove box daily which has liberated significant quantities of tritium which has subsequently been absorbed by the in-built tritium retention system. This technique has slowly reduced the tritium liberated at each step. The large components, such as a getter bed, catalyst bed and a permeator, have been detritiated as far as possible in-situ in readiness for disposal once it is safe to remove them from the glove box.

The study was developed on radiolytical processes in PAA:HTO systems derivated from irradiaton of polymeric network by disintegration of tritium atoms from HTO. The aim of these studies is the identification of polymeric structures and optimal storage conditions. Sol and gel fractions were determinated by radiometrical methods using PAA labeled with 14-C at carboxylic groups and T at main chains of the polymer. Simulation of radiolytical processes was realized using gamma radiation field emitted by a irradiation source of 60-Co which ensures a maximum of absorbed dose rate of 3 kGy/h. Setf-radiolytical effects were investigated using labeled PAA in HTO with great radioactive concentration (37-185 GBq/mL). The experiment suggests as optimum for HTO storage as tritium liquid wastes a 1:30 PAA:HTO swelling degree at 18.5-37 MBqL. HTO radioactive concentration. RES studies of radiolytical processes were also realized on dry polyacrylic acid (PAA) and polyacrylic based hydrogels irradiated and determined at 77 K In the study we observed the effect of swelling capacity of hydrogel o the formation of free radicals.

The absorption peaks of the O-D stretching vibration band were observed in the region of 2500-2750 cm(-1) which were considered to be from the surface OD on the sample. Desorption behavior by irradiation of energetic particles was not uniform but depended on FTIR wave numbers Hence, desorption of D2O was found to be heterogeneous on the surface.

The introduction of tritium into the plasma by gas fuelling and neutral beam injection, even in trace quantities, required the mobilisation of gram-quantities of tritium gas from the Active Gas Handling System (A GHS) product storage units into the supply lines connected to the torus gas valve and the neutral beam injectors. All systems for DT gas handling, recovery and reprocessing were therefore recommissioned and operating procedures re-established, involving extensive operations staff training. The validation of Key Safety Related Equipment (KSRE) is described with reference to specific examples. The differences between requirements for TTE and full DT operations are shown to be relatively small. The scientific motivation for TTE, such as the possibility to obtain high-quality measurements in key areas such as fuel-ion transport and fast ion dynamics, is described, and the re-establishment and development of JET's 14MeV neutron diagnostic capability for TTE and future DT campaigns are outlined. Some scientific highlights from the TTE campaign are presented.

In 2001, the US Department of Energy (DOE) determined that TSTA's mission was complete and that the facility should be stabilized. At the completion of the stabilization project in 2003, TSTA was categorized as a radiological facility. Before stabilization was complete, the tritium inventory at TSTA was grouped in the following categories: tritium gas mixed with hydrogen isotopes, tritiated water absorbed on molecular sieve, tritium held up as a hydride on various metals, and tritium held up in process components. For each of these, tritium content was characterized, a path for removal was determined, and the proper disposal package was developed. Hydrogen exchange, calorimetry, direct sampling, pressure/composition/temperature, radiological smear surveys, and controlled regeneration were used to determine the tritium inventory for each category of tritium. After removal, the tritium inventory was either (1) sent to other facilities for reuse processing or (2) buried at the LANL radioactive waste disposal site. One complete experimental system was packaged and transferred to another DOE site for future use. Special burial containers were designed and fabricated for the inventory buried at the LANL radioactive waste disposal site. The project was conducted with low tritium emission to the environment and negligible personnel exposure. After the tritium removal was complete, all remaining hardware and piping were opened and vented; the facility emission was below 1 Ci per day.

In particular, there are four topics related to tritium being investigated Based on the experience gained on the existing tokamaks, first calculations indicate that in-vessel tritium retention could represent a burden for ITER operation. Therefore erosion/deposition studies are being performed in order to better understand the layer co-deposition and tritium retention processes in tokamaks. Moreover, testing of in-situ detritiation processes, in particular laser and flash lamp treatments, should assess detritiation techniques for in-vessel components in the ITER-relevant JET configuration. To reduce the constraints on waste disposal, dedicated procedures are being developed for detritiation Of metals, graphite, carbon-fibre composites, process and housekeeping waste. During the operational and decommissioning phases of a fusion reactor, many processes will produce tritiated water. Key components for an ITER relevant water detritiation facility are being studied experimentally with the aim of producing a complete design that could be implemented and tested at JET.

The Campaign marked the first use of tritium in JET plasmas since the Deuterium-Tritium Experiment (DTE1) Campaign in 1997, and was the first use of tritium in experiments under the EFDA organisation with the UKAEA as JET Operator. The safety and regulatory preparations for the experiment were extensive. Since JET has been operated by the UKAEA the operations have followed the model of a licensed nuclear site. The safe operation of the JET torus is demonstrated in a safety case. Key Safety Management Requirement (KSMR) and Key Safety Related Equipment (KSRE) are identified in the Safety Case for DT operation. The safe operation of the torus is within the bounds of and under the control of an Authority to Operate (A TO). New technical challenges were presented by the need to inject and account for small quantities of tritium in very short pulses (similar to 80ms), with an accurate time stamp. The safety and operational management of the campaign are described. Valuable lessons were learned which would help in running future experiments. It is concluded that JET is in a strong position to run future trace tritium and full DT discharges.

Supplying the tritium feed via the special electrically grounded gas feed compromised the graded high current triode Positive Ion Neutral Injectors (PINI) due to gas starvation of the source and the methods adopted to ameliorate this effect are described A total of 362 PINI beam pulses were requested, circulating a total of 4.73 g tritium, of which 9.3 mg was injected into the torus. Safety considerations required a continuous, cumulative total to be maintained of the mass of tritium adsorbed onto the cryo-pumping panel; a daily limit of 0.5 g was adopted for the Trace Tritium Experiment (TTE). A subsequent clean up phase using 115 keV deuterium beams completed the isotopic exchange of components in the beamline.

The original design of the reactor PIK Detritiation Plant was completed several years ago. A number of investigations have been made to obtain data for the DP design. Nowadays the design of the DP is being revised on a basis of our investigations. The Combined Electrolysis and Catalytic Exchange (CECE) process will be used at the Detritiation Plant instead of Vapor Phase Catalytic Exchange. The experimental industrial plant for hydrogen isotope separation on the basis of the CECE process is under operation in Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute. The plant was updated to provide a means for heavy water detritiation. Very high detritiation factors have been achieved in the plant. The use of the CECE process will allow the development of a more compact and less expensive detritiation plant for heavy water reactor PIK.

Five WTRF operating scenarios were proposed and the profiles of the tritium level depending on these scenarios were obtained from the simulation. It was predicted that about 9X10(17) Bq/yr of tritium would be removed in the beginning of WTRF operation. However the tritium levels in the moderators will be steadily reduced and saturated less than 3 x 10(11) Bq/kg in 2013, and then about 2 x 10(17) Bq/yr of tritium will be removed from the Wolsong NPPs by the WTRF operation.

The new waste gas processing systems located in the newer facility utilize recent technology, including metal getters, an innovative permeator design, and TCAP (Thermal Cycling Absorption Process) technology for removal of residual tritium prior to releasing the effluent to the environment. Startup testing results (using protium and deuterium) and corresponding lessons learned for these systems are presented. These systems have since successfully completed tritium startup testing and are operational.

The steady tritium concentration increased with water vapor concentration. The total amount of tritium released from the vacuum vessel was 13MBq for 3406ppm. This amount is almost the same as that removed by 5 hours' H-2-GDC, which has been the most effective method for tritium removal from JT-60U [1]. This suggests that tritium in the vacuum vessel of JT-60U can be easily removed by water vapor. Tritium released into exhaust gas during gas purging was also measured for varying gases (H-2, He and Ar), at different pressures and temperatures of the vacuum vessel. Tritium concentration of the exhaust gas was about 0.1 Bq/cm(3) at room temperature and was independent of gas species within the pressure from 0.05 to 0.3 Pa. This result indicates that isotope exchange of tritium with hydrogen molecules was not so active under these purge conditions.

The basic tritium accounting characteristics have been investigated and practical data on the accounting stability has been accumulated under gram level tritium storage for more than 8 years. The initial sensitivity of tritium was about 0.05 g and the accuracy (standard deviation of repeat measurements: two sigma) was about 0.15 g at full tritium storage of 25 g. This initial accounting performance has been maintained after tritium storage for more than 8 years by keeping constant accounting conditions at each inventory measurement. Almost no aging effect of tritium was found except accumulation of 3 He in the primary ZrCo tritide vessel, which was easily evacuated to keep initial accounting condition before each inventory measurement.

A specially designed metallic vial fitted with a gold-coated beryllium window was prepared for the present examinations. Only tritiated water of a given amount was put into the vial. The volume dependence of the X-ray intensity showed that 5 cm 3 of tritiated water is sufficient for measurements. It was found that the spectrum of X-rays induced by beta-rays consisted of only bremsstrahlung. The bremsstrahlung spectrum could be reproduced quite well by computational simulation. A good linear relation between the X-ray intensity and tritium concentration was obtained in the concentration range of 4x10(-3) - 40 ABq cm(-3). Furthermore, effect of nickel added as a model impurity to tritiated water was examined, and it was found that the tritium concentration can be evaluated from the X-ray intensity without any correction in the presence of impurity below 200 ppm.

The tritium inventory for the STAR facility will be maintained below 1.5 g to avoid the need for STAR to be classified as a Category 3 nuclear facility. A key capability in successful operation of the STAR facility is the ability to receive, inventory, and dispense tritium to the various experiments underway there. The system central to that function is the Tritium Storage and Assay System (SAS). The SAS has four major functions: (1) receiving and holding tritium, (2) assaying, (3) dispensing, and (4) purifying hydrogen isotopes from non-hydrogen species. This paper describes the design and operation of the STAR SAS and the procedures used for tritium accountancy in the STAR facility.

Newly created codeposited layers of carbon and hydrogen were identified as the main sinks. The first wall of ITER in contrast to JET and TFTR will be covered with beryllium, whereas the divertor tiles will be built of tungsten with the exception of a relatively small area of carbon fibre composites. Due to these three materials the composition of the newly created layers will change as a function of plasma operation. Their possible hydrogen content is not known yet and as a consequence the estimates of potentially trapped tritium differ strongly. To respect safety limits measurements of the mobilisable tritium inventories inside the vacuum vessel are required. The present strategy is to rely on the accountancy of the accessible tritium inside the fuel cycle and to derive the quantity of tritium trapped inside the vessel by difference. The tritium injected into the machine is only measured by mass flow meters and no effort is made to determine the tritium exhausted. Enhancements to determine the tritium and deuterium amounts injected into the torus and first proposals for enabling accountancy of the tritium and deuterium released from the torus cryo-pumps on a shot-by-shot basis are given. Only few additional buffer volumes and a micro gas chromatograph are required as the solutions are simple and inexpensive. These tools could be used already in the H-phase of ITER to obtain an integral value of the hydrogen trapped in the codeposited layers by simple addition of small concentrations of deuterium to the protium and measuring the injected and released deuterium amounts.

It is very likely that measurements of total tritium inventories may not be possible for all subsystems, however tritium accounting may be achieved by modeling its hold-up within each sub-system and by validating these models in real-time against the monitored flows and tritium streams between the systems. To get reliable results, an accurate dynamic modeling of the tritium content in each sub-system is necessary. In order to optimize the configuration and operation of the ITER fuel cycle, a dynamic fuel cycle model was developed progressively in the decade up to 2000200][1]. As the design for some sub-systems from the fuel cycle (i.e. Vacuum pumping, Neutral Beam Injectors (NBI)) have substantially progressed meanwhile, a new code developed under a different platform to incorporate these modifications has been developed. The new code is taking over the models and algorithms for some subsystems, such as Isotope Separation System (ISS); where simplified models have been previously considered, more detailed have been introduced, as for the Water Detritiation System (WDS). To reflect all these changes, the new code developed inside EU participating team was nominated TRIMO (Tritium Inventory Modeling), to emphasize the use of the code on assessing the tritium inventory within ITER.

The sensor functions at high pressures and concentrations where previously no simple and cost effective direct measurement technique existed for tritium. A polished KOVAR(TM) (Fe-Ni-Co alloy) rod was coated with a I-pm thick insulating layer of alumina using electron-beam evaporation, physical vapor deposition (PVD) of alumina with oxygen dosing. The alumina deposition process was optimized to minimize pinholes and obtain a stable coating with high resistivity. The detector exhibited a nanoampere electrical response over a few decades of tritium concentration, up to pure tritium at 200 kPa. The sensor has been in service for several months now without showing signs of degradation and no discernible physical damage or change in efficiency has been observed.

In this paper a new tritium gas generator is described in detail together with the method of measurement based on the internal gas counting. It has new and improved features and offers the advantage of being simpler and easier to operate than other tritium generators available. Thus, this tritium generator has the following new features:(i) it,performs the water reduction at a lower temperature (450 degrees C) than the other generators which need 600 degrees C; (ii) the reduction yield is always unitary. Also, it has a simple and compact construction by using the same components for water degassing and water reduction. Its simple disassembly and reassembly allow for easy maintenance.

These monitors require initial and periodic calibration certification at the levels likely to be encountered We describe a purpose built gas handling apparatus which enables various activity levels of tritiated gas (H-3 + N-2) to be precisely metered and circulated in a closed loop through the monitor under calibration at a wide range of activity levels.

At the outset their main purpose was to identify the direction of a possible inadvertent release of tritium into the environment. More recently, however, there has been growing interest in their use as stand-alone devices for tritium determination at environmental levels. This has necessitated a more rigorous design to reduce the "draughts effect" in exposed locations and has also required modifications to enable the measurement of HTO + HT. The paper describes the recent design improvements and the results of validation tests carried out against dynamic, discriminating (dry-bed) samplers.

J	Worth, LBC; Pearce, RJH; Bruce, J; Banks, J; Scales, S				Worth, LBC; Pearce, RJH; Bruce, J; Banks, J; Scales, S			Development of a novel contamination resistant ion chamber for process tritium measurement and use in the JET first trace tritium experiment	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 12-17, 2004	Baden Baden, GERMANY					The accuracy of process measurements of tritium with conventional ion chambers is often affected by surface tritium contamination. The measurement of tritium in the exhaust of the JET torus is particularly difficult due to surface contamination with highly tritiated hydrocarbons. JET's first unsuccessful attempt to overcome the contamination problem was to use an ion chamber, with a heating element as the chamber wall so that it could be periodically decontaminated by baking. The newly developed ion chamber works on the principle of minimising the surface area within the boundary of the anode and cathode. This paper details the design of the ion chamber, which utilises a grid of 50-micron tungsten wire to define the ion chamber wall and the collector electrode. The effective surface area which, by contamination, is able to effect the measurement of tritium within the process gas has been reduced by a factor of similar to 200 over a conventional ion chamber. It is concluded that the new process ion chamber enables sensitive accurate tritium measurements free from contamination issues. It will be a powerful new tool for future tritium experiments both to improve tritium tracking and to help in the understanding of tritium retention issues.

The magnetic field uniformly increasing in the direction from the observable surface to the recording screen was used. The principal conditions of identical transfer of the image and its reduction coefficient were determined depending on the ratio of the magneticfields on the sample surface and the screen. The experiments were carried out in vacuum conditions. The magnetic field was produced with a cylindrical rod of a magnetic material and in the screen area it was 0.5 T Formation, transport and detection of images were fulfilled in a wide range of their reduction ratio (1-1/40).
