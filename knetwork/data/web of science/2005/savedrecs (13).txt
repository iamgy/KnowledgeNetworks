The most useful method to measure the TPR in the neutron benchmark experiments is the liquid scintillation counting with Li2CO3 pellet. Ten years ago, the method of Li2CO3 pellet has been sufficiently verified the accuracy by means of D-T fast neutron irradiation and it was concluded within 10%. However, on the recent breeding blanket design, tritium is dominantly produced with the thermal neutron made with the scattering of D-T neutron and also the accuracy of the tritium production rate is requested below 10%. Therefore, previous verification is not sufficient for the recent blanket design and it is necessary to carry out the activity of the verification again. The JAERI, ENEA and TUD began to carry out the tritium benchmark experiment to verify the tritium production rate for the recent fusion blanket.

The saturated vapour are obtained by bubbling from vials containing different tritium standard solutions (IFIN-HH-TDCR method). The main difference from the usual method, elaborated by Osborne, is the use of saturated vapour, which eliminates the measurement in liquid scintillator of the recovered non-saturated vapour. Tritium Monitors type MT-1 made in IFIN-HH were calibrated. The measurements were carried out for three levels of the activity concentration: 0.0180, 0.701 and 1.73 MBq.g(-1). The mean response was R=2.25.10(-13) A/(MBq m(-3)) with a relative combined uncertainty lower than 4%. The value agrees with the result obtained with the Osborne method, R-Os = 2.30.10(-13) A/(MBq m(-3)) and with the estimated theoretical value, 2.29 10(-1)3 A/(MBq m(-3)).

It is considered that the isotope exchange reaction between tritiated water in air and water in a beaker, the evaporation or condensation reaction of water at surface and the diffusion of tritium in water played the important roles in the tritium transfer phenomena through the air-water interface. Using the mass transfer coefficients obtained in the previous paper change of tritium level in water contained in a shallow open beaker was numerically estimated and comparison with the experimental data showed good agreement. The estimated amount of tritium released from the facility with storage pools of spent fuels from a PWR power station using the method of this study showed good agreement with the observed value evaluated from the monitor of the power station.

If any HT is released into the workplace, a fraction may be converted to tritiated water vapour (HTO). A convenient method to determine the activity concentration of each species is necessary to assess the potential hazard since the radiological hazard of HTO is more than 104 that due to HT. Passive samplers for measuring tritiated water vapour (HTO) have been shown to be suitable for use indoors and outdoors [1,2, 3]. These simple samplers consist of a standard 20-mL liquid scintillation vial with a diffusion orifice that determines the sampling rate. The total tritium samplers described herein are passive or diffusion samplers that contain a small amount of AECL-proprietary wet-proofed catalyst fixed to the underside of the sampling heads to allow conversion of the HT to HTO that is subsequently collected in the sink, (HTO), in the bottom of the sampler. After an appropriate sampling time, liquid scintillation cocktail is added to the vial and the activity collected determined by liquid scintillation analysis. When used in conjunction with the conventional HTO passive sampler the difference between the total and HTO samplers can be used to determine the HT fraction ((HT+HTO) - HTO HT). The sampling rates for the modified diffusion sampler were measured to be 4.6 and 8.1 L/d for HTO and HT respectively. For a fifteen-minute sampling period, passive samplers can be used to measure tritium activity concentrations from 37 kBq/m(3) to 115 MBq/m(3).

However, there is no tritium monitor, which is able to measure the concentration separately. In the light of it, we are developing a new monitor, which will be enable us to measure the tritium concentrations in two of these species, Le. molecular hydrogen and methane. The specific activities of tritium in molecular hydrogen and in methane are very high. Then if we can collect the hydrogen and the methane, we will easily measure the tritium concentrations. We have conceptually designed a new tritium monitor and carried out several basic experiments. Based on the results of these experiments, we have estimated the performance of the monitor. For an hour counting, the monitor will be able to measure the tritium concentrations of molecular hydrogen and methane using about 4m(3) air. Since the total performance of the monitor mainly depends on the capability of the proportional counter, we are developing an appropriate counter.

The analyzer utilizes the functions of a gas chromatograph and an atomic absorption spectrophotometer and is based on the reduction reaction of mercuric oxide with hydrogen. Three test samples were used: gas mixtures containing both protium and deuterium with almost equal concentrations of about 5, 20, or 50 cm(3)/1000 m(3) diluted in nitrogen. Each measurement was repeated more than 30 times, and chromatograms were obtained for each test sample. Examination of the chromatograms showed that the retention times for the protium and deuterium could be clearly distinguished The retention times were virtually constant and indistinguishable, independent of the concentration and repetition time. The peak areas for the protium and deuterium were also stable, independent of the repetition time. Moreover, there was a clear linear relationship between the peak areas and concentrations for both elements. These results show that the analyzer can distinguish the two hydrogen isotopes and estimate concentrations of each as small as about 5 cm(3)/1000 m(3). They also show that it may be possible to use the analyzer to monitor tritium concentrations.

While effective, this method can be time consuming, can alter the surface, only measures removable tritium and produces radioactive waste. For a given application each of these considerations may or may not be a disadvantage. A solid state monitor, on the other hand, has the potential to provide rapid analysis, not alter the surface, measure all tritium on a surface and produce little or not radioactive waste. This allure has promoted open wall ion chamber and PIN diode-based tritium surface monitor development, and these techniques have enjoyed certain success. Recently the first tests were performed with an avalanche photodiode (APD) for surface tritium measurement. While quite similar in concept to PIN diode based measurements, side-by-side testing showed that the APD provided substantially better counting efficiency. Considerations included count rate, background, sensitivity, stability and effect of ambient light. Of particular importance in the US, the APD was able to measure concentrations down to the "free release" limit, i.e., the concentration below which items can be removed from radiological control areas.

The 1.2 meter (four-foot) long process vessel contains on internal "U-tube" for tritium In-Bed Accountability (IBA) measurements. IBA will be performed on six, 12.6 kg production metal hydride storage beds. IBA tests were done on a prototype bed using electric heaters to simulate the radiolytic decay of tritium. Tests had gas flows from 10 to 100 SLPM through the U-tube or 100 SLPM through the bed's vacuum jacket. IBA inventory measurement errors at the 95% confidence level were calculated using the correlation of IBA gas temperature rise, or (hydride) bed temperature rise above ambient temperature, versus simulated tritium inventory. Prototype bed IBA inventory errors at 100 SLPM were the largest for gas flows through the vacuum jacket: 15.2 grams for the bed temperature rise and 11.5 grams for the gas temperature rise. For a 100 SLPM U-tube flow, the inventory error was 2.5 grams using bed temperature rise and 1.6 grams using gas temperature rise. For 50 to 100 SLPM U-tube flows, the IBA gas temperature rise inventory errors were nominally one to two grams that increased above four grams for flows less than 50 SLPM. For 50 to 100 SLPM U-tube flows, the IBA bed temperature rise inventory errors were greater than the gas temperature rise errors, but similar errors were found for both methods at gas flows of 20, 30, and 40 SLPM. Electric heater IBA tests were done for six production hydride beds using a 45 SLPM U-tube gas flow. Of the duplicate runs performed on these beds, five of the six beds produced IBA inventory errors of approximately three grams: consistent with results obtained in the laboratory prototype tests.

EMRAS includes a working group (WG) on modeling tritium and C-14 transfer through the environment to biota and man. The main objective of this WG is to develop and test models of the uptake, formation and translocation of organically bound tritium (OBT) in food crops, animals and aquatic systems. To the extent possible, the WG is carrying out its work by comparing model predictions with experimental data to identify the modeling approaches and assumptions that lead to the best agreement between predictions and observations. Results for scenarios involving a chronically contaminated aquatic ecosystem and short-term exposure of soybeans are presently being analyzed. In addition, calculations for scenarios involving chronically contaminated terrestrial food chains and hypothetical short-term releases are currently underway, and a pine-tree scenario is being developed. The preparation of datasets on tritium dynamics in large animals and fish is being encouraged, since these are the areas of greatest uncertainty in OBT modeling. These activities will be discussed in this paper.

Nearly 90% of its measurements have been covered by two national programs, both approved by the Slovenian Nuclear Safety Administration: the radioactive monitoring program in the environs of Krsko Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) and the program of global radioactive contamination monitoring in the environment. These programs include samples of groundwaters, surface waters, precipitation and drinking waters, as well as liquid and gaseous effluents from KNPP. Tritium was determined in some research projects and in hydrological studies of thermal waters, groundwater and coalmine waters. Tritium in the Karst region was mapped as well as the springs of entire territory of Slovenia. Around 5500 samples have been analyzed up to 2004.

Leaks of tritium are captured by a tritium stripping system using an oxidation-absorption process. Tritium is captured as tritiated water in zeolite beds and is recovered by desorption and reduction. The regenerated zeolite beds are reused. Reduction of the tritiated water is accomplished by a zeolite bed recovery system using hot magnesium beds. The system has been in operation for about 10 years and met original design requirements. Recent expansion of the facility requires a higher capacity of the system. Operation data are collected and analyzed. Ways to increase the system capacity are discussed.

This study aims at giving practical guidance to decision-makers in the case of severe release depending on the circumstances of the accident and will be useful for authorities to reduce, if necessary, the consequences of such a release. Our analysis establishes a classification of different pathways; defines the importance of the different parameters; assists in the definition of a post-release monitoring and emergency plan; and gives an evaluation of what is required to return to a normal situation. The difference between the various chemical forms of tritium is addressed.

Such conditions as turbulence, convection, condensation and moisture evaporation processes, etc. are to be also taken into account as well as the interaction processes among impurities (gases, aerosols), atmosphere and the Earth's surface. 3-D computational fluid dynamics model(CFD) developed on the basis of SRP hydrodynamic code was used to simulate tritium plume evolution and tritium transport in atmosphere under the area with relatively complex topography. SRP code is based on the continuum motion equations (Navier-Stockes equations) and thermodynamic relations taking into account specific features of atmospheric flows and complex topography and is designed to use on PC-type computers. The model has been validated using experimental release of tritium with specified source term and meteorology. Due to low release height above the underlying surface a fine grid was used in the vertical direction near the underlying surface. HT and HTO/H2O vertical fluxes were taken into account. Evolution of HT and HTO activities at 2 sampling locations along the plume axe were available for model-experiment inter-comparison. The modeling results of HT and HTO activities in the air during plume travel are in satisfactory agreement with observed values.

As the results, it is revealed that tritium concentration decay and permeation issues are not serious problem in a viewpoint of safety, since it is expected that tritium concentration in the hot cell decrease rapidly within several days just after removing the tritium release source, and tritium permeation through the epoxy painted concrete wall will be negligible as long as the averaged realistic diffusion coefficient is ensured in the concrete wall. It is also revealed that the epoxy paint on the concrete wall prevents the tritium inventory increase in the concrete wall greatly (two orders of magnitudes), but still, the inventory in the wall is estimated to reach about 0.1 PBq for 20 years operation.

As a manner to improve the partial pressure difference between feed and permeated side, intended reflux of vapor and the hydrogen concentrated at permeated side is conceived to enlarge the partial pressure difference. Membrane separation with reflux flow has been proposed as an attractive process to enhance the recovery ratio of tritium component. Effect of reflux on the recovery ratio of tritium component was evaluated by numerical analysis. The effect of reflux on separation performance becomes striking as the target species have higher permeability coefficients. Hence, the gas separation by membrane with reflux flow is favorable for tritium recovery.

The purpose of this study was mainly focused to; 1) investigate the effect of atmospheric exchange time per hour on the tritium confinement performance in an actual scaled tritium handling room after off-normal tritium release; 2) investigate the effect of atmospheric exchange time per hour on the time necessary for detecting tritium release; 3) investigate the suitable location of exhaust ducts and alarm monitors. The simulated room used in the present analysis is approximately 3000 m(3) of tritium handling room (12.00 m(W) 29.00 m(D) and 8.50 m(H)) with six supply ducts and six exhaust ducts. Atmospheric exchange time per hour is changed as a parameter from 0.67 to 3.33 times per hour.

The model assumes that for the investigated cases, tritium behaviour can be characterized by solving the dynamic equations of motion (the compressible Navier-Stokes equations) coupled with the classical k-epsilon turbulence model to simulate the ventilation in the room and mass diffusion for tritium spreading. The GASFLOW-II fluid dynamics field code, developed through a Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe co-operation, was used as the computational tool to solve the equations that describe the processes. The numerical results have been validated with experimental data collected on the experimental facility (Caisson) at the Tritium Process Laboratory (TPL) Japan.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the environmental impact of tritium released from WTRF in the postulated accident. In order to achieve this, a computer code was developed at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology). This code can be used to evaluate the individual and public dose with the source term. This source term can represent not only the concentration of tritium that will be stored at the long term tritium storage vault located in the underground of WTRF building but also may be released to the environment from the WTRF online system by variously postulated accidents. To validate this code, calculated results were compared with the previous reference under the same assumption. Even if the most severe postulated accident that the tritium may be released through the fracture of the storage vault was occurred, the result of individual dose at the exclusion area boundary is turned out to be within the radiation dose limit.

The detritiation system consists of two oxidation catalyst beds (473K and 773K) for converting hydrogen isotopes and tritiated methane in compounds to water vapor and a molecular sieve drying absorber for removing water vapor as the usual detritiation system. In this time, the performance of oxidation catalyst bed of the detritiation system for hydrogen and methane under existence of carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide which are produced in the fire was investigated. Basic performance of the detritiation system for hydrogen (1.9%) and methane (1.3%) in air was evaluated under maximum ventilation flow rate (2.64m(3)/h). Obtained oxidation efficiency was more than 99.99% for hydrogen in the catalyst bed at 473K and more than 99.9% for methane in the 773K one, respectively. It was confirmed that these performances were maintained even under carbon dioxide of up to 20%, carbon monoxide of up to 10% if sufficient oxygen remained in the process gas, and that the existence of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide at the fire would not influence the performance of the oxidation catalyst bed in the detritiation system.

The catalytic oxidation of isotopic hydrogen including tritium is a conventional method for removing tritium from the air of the room. If a tritium release accident occurs in the fusion plant, large volumes of air should be processed by the air cleanup system. The system should be designed to be able to process the gas with high volumetric velocity. However, the high throughput of air causes pressure drop in the catalyst bed, which results in high load to the pumping system. In this study, and their applicability of honeycomb catalysts to the tritium recovery system was examined The honeycomb catalyst has an advantage in terms of pressure drop, which is far less than that in conventional particle-packed catalyst beds. The experiments on honeycomb catalysts such as cordierite and Al-Cr-Fe metal alloy indicate their preferable oxidizing performance. Particularly, the metal honeycomb has an advantage for hydrogen gas oxidization at room temperature because it is expected to be less affected memory effect by tritium contamination. Thus, these honeycomb catalysts are applicable to the tritiated gases recovery system with high performance.

The atmospheric behavior of tritium is described by a Gaussian dispersion model. The tritium concentration in the atmosphere, soil, vegetables and cereals were estimated on the basis of tritium inventory of the facility and the release rate of tritium. In the model description, the specific tritium concentrations for the free water component and the organic component are essential. The food chain for humans was modeled by assuming a forage compartment, a plant compartment and an animal compartment. In the model, a virtual plant and a virtual animal were defined. The calculation revealed that the exchange of HTO between atmosphere and plant leaves has a critical role for increasing the human dose both for stationary and accidental release of tritium.

Using mathematical time-series techniques, analytical expressions were obtained for the temporal trend and the periodicity present in the data. These expressions were used to determine the transit times between the sampling sites. The results indicated that the mean speed of 3 H displacement was 12 km/month. The residence times of tritium in the water were also obtained They were found to depend on the sampling points, with values ranging between 31 and 77 months. The concentrations of 3H varied cyclically at the six sampling points, with periods of around 24 months upstream of the Almaraz Nuclear Power Plant and about 12 months downstream.

J	Raskob, W; Velarde, M; Perlado, JM				Raskob, W; Velarde, M; Perlado, JM			Tritium dose assessments with regulatory and advanced computer models for the potential European ITER site Vandellos (Spain)	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 12-17, 2004	Baden Baden, GERMANY					Deterministic and probabilistic dose assessments for releases of tritium have been performed for the potential European ITER Site of Vandellos (Spain). Besides national regulatory models, internationally accepted computer codes such as NORMTRI (for normal conditions) and UFOTRI (for incidental/accidental conditions) were used for the calculations. The paper concentrates on releases of tritium in either HT or HTO form. Source terms from the ITER documentation (GSSR vol. IV and VII) have been used for the HT/HTO releases. The data base of NORMTRI/UFOTRI was adapted to the national regulatory prescriptions. This comprised in particular ingestion habits and dose conversion factors. Important for the calculations was also the selection of meteorological, demographic, nutritional and agricultural data. Meteorological data over a period of one year was used for the probabilistic calculations. Deterministic scenarios were selected to be as close as possible to other studies performed in the frame of ITER. Results of the assessments were early and chronic doses which have been evaluated for the Most Exposed Individual at particular distance bands from the release point. Of particular importance was the comparison between the regulatory and the advanced assessment models. Regulatory models for tritium are sometimes simplistic and are either too conservative or do not consider important processes which might lead to underestimation of the dose. This is for example the case with organically bound tritium which is often not considered in regulatory models but may dominate the dose from ingestion pathways. Therefore, this comparison provided the opportunity to evaluate the appropriateness of a national accepted tool. As the site of ITER was still to be defined, such a comparison was vital and might be also necessary for any other site to assure public confidence in the licensing procedure.

The collected data demonstrate that the PDS are low cost and low maintenance means for reliable monitoring of airborne HTO emissions. The data indicate a rapid decrease of atmospheric HTO concentrations with increasing distance from the facility in all directions. A strong correlation (r=0.89) was found between reported releases of HTO from the facility and the HTO air concentrations observed at the monitoring locations. Distribution of HTO around the facility correlated strongly (r=0.99) with local wind distribution.

The code can deal with the hourly change of weather conditions and tritium release rates as are mainly observed in an accidental release. In order to validate its prediction accuracy, and to verify its effectiveness, we calculated using scenario 3 (constant release) and scenario 4.2 (intermittent release) supplied by BIOMASS (Biosphere Modeling and Assessment) program by IAEA. Tritium concentrations predicted by EESAD calculation agreed well with those observed. Tritium deposition from the plume (dry and wet), re-emission from the soil surface, and infiltration to the lower soil layers were all considered in the EESAD system, and found to be effective to get better agreement. The EESAD is useful for calculating not only a controlled constant release with meteorological changes but also an instantaneous release with hourly changes of the release conditions.

The data cover most compartments Of the terrestrial food chain in an agricultural setting and include detailed information on the diets of the local farm animals. Ratios of plant OBT concentration to air moisture HTO varied between 0.12 and 0.56, and were generally higher for the forage crops collected at the dairy farms than for the garden vegetables sampled at the hobby farm. Animal OBT to air HTO ratios were more uniform, ranging from 0.18 to 0.45, and were generally higher for the milk and beef samples from the dairy farms than for the chicken products from the hobby farm. The observed OBT concentrations in plants and animals were compared with predictions of IMPACT, the model used by the Canadian nuclear industry to calculate annual average doses due to routine releases. The model performed well on average for the animal endpoints but overestimated concentrations in plants by a factor of 2.

Since the current model test exercises focus on the uptake, formation and translocation of organically bound tritium (OBT) in food crops, our monitoring program was designed to obtain useful information on the OBT formation in different parts of the pine tree by uptake of tritium through the atmosphere and soil. Monitoring was conducted in ordinal environment as well as in the vicinity of tritium discharge sources. The observations allow the discussion of the dependencies of OBT formation in the foliage part or wood part of the pine tree on an air-foliage pathway. As conclusions the usefulness of OBT data of a pine tree used as a bio-indicator for monitoring is presented.

It enters the water cycle after its oxidation and through the precipitation. The measurement of tritium concentration in rainwater is of great importance because it can be used for hydrology investigations such as the recharge mode or the vulnerability of aquifers. For this purpose, rainwater samples were collected for a period of 16 months from October 2002 to January 2004 from a sampling station at Ioannina, northwestern Greece. Each sample was filtered and measured without any further treatment for tritium activity, using a super low-level background, liquid scintillation analyzer. Five mL of the sample were mixed with 15 mL of scintillation cocktail, specially designed for low-level tritium measurements and its beta activity was measured for 500 min. Results show that during the sampling period, the tritium concentration varied up to two fold, increasing during the spring and summer months. The measured tritium concentrations in rainwater, which ranged from 9 +/- 4 to 23 +/- 5 TU, can be used for local hydrology studies.

We attempted electrolytic enrichment under the following conditions: (1) A standard water cell and sample water cell are connected in series and enriched using solid polymer electrolytic film (SPE film). (2) The apparatus constant obtained from the standard cell was used to estimate the tritium concentration in the sample water (3) SPE film was replaced and the electrolytic cell was dismantled, cleaned and set up for every run. We repeated electrolytic enrichments for three different water samples with four replicates per sample. Results confirmed that this method is valid for the estimation of tritium concentrations in environmental water samples.

The apparent separation factors alpha(a) for deuterium and beta(a) for tritium were determined as 3.5 +/- 0.1 and 62 +/- 0.5, respectively. The tritium enrichment of 8.4 times was achieved, when a 1000 ml of sample water was electrolyzed to about 60 ml. The chemical composition changes before and after the electrolysis were examined, showing an increase in H+ and Na+ concentrations and a decrease in Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations. F, which was not contained in the sample water, was detected after electrolysis accompanying with a reduction of SO42- Cl- and NO3-. The memory of tritium and ions in the electrolysis cell after electrolysis was possible to be eliminated by washings with de-ionized water. Tritium concentrations of rain at Kumamoto, Japan were determined with a combination of the present electrolytic enrichment system and liquid scintillation counting.

Investigations are performed in mixtures of all three hydrogen isotopes. Stringent requirements are placed on such sources. Primarily, this is reliability and safety, purity of supplied gas, possibility of smooth pressure control, minimal dimensions and the ease to operate. Vanadium-base thermodesorption sources meet these requirements. Literature data on equilibrium pressures of hydrogen isotopes desorption over vanadium dihydride phase have been reviewed It has been shown that in data analysis, gas nonideality at high pressure should he taken into account. In particular, when showing temperature dependencies of desorption equilibrium pressures it is reasonable to use appropriate value of fugacity. The paper presents temperature dependencies of protium and deuterium fugacity over corresponding dihydride vanadium phases in the range of 300-635K, determined using experimental data of the authors. Temperature dependence of tritium fugacity over dihydride vanadium phase at 273-483K determined using experimental data of the authors and available literature data are also presented. A series of vanadium-base thermodesorption high-pressure hydrogen isotopes sources have been developed in RFNC-VNIIEF using of the obtained dependencies. Schemes of sources for research in fundamental science are presented.

Bubble nucleation, modeled as self-trapping of interstitially diffusing He atoms, occurs during the first few days following tritium introduction into the metal Bubble growth by dislocation loop punching yields good agreement between He atomic volumes and bubble pressures determined from bulk swelling and He-3 NMR data. The bubble spacing distribution determined from NMR is shown to remain fixed with age, justifying the separation of nucleation and growth phases and providing a sensitive test of the growth formulation. Late in life, bubble interactions are proposed to produce cooperative stress effects, which lower the bubble pressure. Helium generated near surfaces and surface-connected porosity accounts for the low-level early helium release. Use of an average ligament stress criterion predicts an onset of inter-bubble fracture in good agreement with the He/Metal ratio observed for rapid He release. From the model, it is concluded that He retention can be controlled through control of bubble nucleation.

The addition of interstitial H (D, or T) atoms, located at (0, 1/2, 0) in the fcc Pd lattice, affects all three elastic constants C', C-44, and B. In the mixed (a+beta) phase, and with increasing H isotope, the shear modulus C' shows an abnormal softening whereas C-44 and B do not. This is explained in terms of Zener-type anelastic relaxations affecting the shape of the hydride phases in the coherent(alpha+beta) two-phase mixture In the single A phase, C' shows a strong isotope dependence whereas C-44 and B show none. This behavior is explained in terms of differences in the excitation of optical phonons. In Pd-T, He-3 is produced by the radioactive decay of tritium. We have measured in situ the swelling and the change in the elastic constants in Pd-T as a function of aging time. Aging (He formation) affects all three elastic constants. These measurements are being used to understand the early stages of H-3-He-3 cluster formation in aged Pd-T crystal.

Impurities accumulated in the inner leg of all the divertors, and operation of the first (Mk I) divertor with beryllium tiles demonstrated that most are eroded from the main chamber walls and swept along the scrape-off layer to the inner divertor. Carbon deposited at the inner divertor is then locally transported to shadowed regions such as the inner louvres, where, for example, most of the tritium was trapped during the deuterium-tritium experiment (DTE1).

The deuterium retained in the near surface of all graphite tiles was mostly replaced by hydrogen due to exposure to hydrogen plasma at the final stage operations, resulting in main deuterium retention in the deeper region. The dominant species desorbed from the divertor tiles were H-2, HD, D-2 and CH4. The smallest retention of hydrogen isotopes (H+D) was observed in the outer divertor tile which was eroded with maximum of 20 mu m depth. The amount of H+D retained in the inner divertor tiles covered by the re-deposited layers increased with the thickness of the re-deposited layers. Hydrogen isotopes concentration ((H+D)/C) in the re-deposited layers was similar to 0.02, which was much smaller than those observed in JET and other devices.

When the graphite tiles were exposed to hydrogen at 1000 degrees C, the release of deuterium and tritium was enhanced It is considered that the deuterium and tritium left in the graphite tile was released by the isotope exchange reaction. In order to remove almost all deuterium or tritium from the graphite tile without combustion of graphite, isotope exchange method at high temperature is effective. It was found that the amount of hydrogen retained in the graphite tile was much larger than that of deuterium. This indicates that a large amount of deuterium trapped in the tiles during deuterium discharge experiments was replaced with hydrogen during hydrogen discharge experiments. Additionally, depth profiles of hydrogen isotope are discussed from the obtained release curves.

Approximately 50-80 % of tritium was released by dry argon gas purge and 20-50 % of tritium was released by humid argon gas purge up to 800-1200 degrees C within one day, respectively. Further several percent of tritium was released by full combustion with oxygen. It was experimentally confirmed that all retained tritium is not released by thermal dry gas purge and by use of isotope exchange reaction at high temperature in such a short period. In the full combustion operation, isotropic graphite begins to combust at higher temperature than 650 degrees C, but effective combustion temperature was higher than 700 degrees C. Since it is very difficult to heat the graphite tile attached on the wall of vacuum vessel at higher than 700 degrees C, it is considered to be not easy to recover all the tritium retained in the graphite while in the vacuum vessel.

Tritium distribution on the plasma-facing surface was consistent with carbon deposition profiles and asymmetric in both poloidal and toroidal directions. The toroidal asymmetry was attributed to the alignment of the tiles preventing direct impact of flux lines to tile edges. Accordingly, no significant carbon deposition or tritium accumulation was observed on two sides facing the toroidal direction. As already reported, heavy codeposition retaining high levels of tritium was observed on the plasma-shadow area of the horizontal target tile surface and the bottom side of the vertical target tile of the inner divertor region where it was kept relatively cool by water coolant. In addition, TIPT has clearly distinguished at least two different carbon deposition layers with different tritium retention in poloidal direction, showing that the poloidal asymmetry on the horizontal target tiles is due to the different carbon deposition properties in the poloidal direction. All the results suggest that tritium retention in the divertor area, which was determined by the carbon/ hydrocarbon distribution, correlates closely with divertor geometry and surface temperature.

We report on Imaging Plate measurements of the tritium areal distribution on the side surface of graphite/CFC tiles installed in the TFTR bumper limiter and JET Mk IIA divertor, both of which were exposed to D-T discharges. The tritium profiles on the four sides of TFTR tiles showed a short- and long-range decay pattern. In case of JET divertor tiles, only a small amount of tritium retention was detected on the tiles side facing the toroidal direction, while tritium retention was very large on the side facing the poloidal direction. These retention properties showed that the orientation or alignment of plasma facing component plays important role on the tritium retention in the gaps of those machines.

Although many studies on hydrogen behavior in tungsten have been carried out, there is insufficient database for a tungsten re-deposition layer. We have made a tungsten re-deposition layer by a sputtering method using a hydrogen and deuterium RF plasma and have investigated hydrogen retention in the layer and the distribution of the layer in the vacuum chamber. The amount of deposited tungsten increased 2.4 times with varying RF power from 100 W to 250 W. It was found from the SEM observation on the cross section that the formed layer has a columnar structure. At high energy (RF power: 250 W), a lot of blisters were observed on the surface. The ratio of hydrogen atoms to tungsten atoms (H/W) in the layer was observed to be 0.1 similar to 0.4 with varying RF power. These values of hydrogen retention were much larger than that for absorption into tungsten. Tritium inventory in a D-T fusion reactor may become larger than expected by the formation of tungsten redeposition layer.

Granules of alumina, silica and molecular sieve were coated with platinum as the catalyst. The granules saturated with water at room humidity were packed in a 2-cm diameter column for isotope exchange tests. Deuterium and protium were alternately fed through the column at a constant rate. Isotope concentration in column effluent was monitored to generate isotope break-through curves. The curves were analyzed to produce information on the kinetics and capacity of the material. The results showed that all materials tested provided some extent of isotope exchange but some were superior both in kinetics and capacity. This paper will present the test results.

It is important to grasp the tritium behavior in the concrete wall for radiation safety. It is considered in this study that the surface water on the concrete materials consists of physically adsorbed water, chemically adsorbed water and structural water as in the case of porous adsorption materials. The adsorption capacity due to physically and chemically adsorption isotherms observed in this study shows that the amount of water adsorption on the cement paste is a quarter of the amount adsorbed onto the surface of activated alumina or molecular sieves 5A (MS-5A). It shows that concrete is easily contaminated with tritiated water.

So reemission of tritium from tritium-sorbed molecular sieve is concerned for tritium waste disposal. 4A, 5A and 10X MS were chosen for the tritium reemission test. The tritium-containing MS samples with specific activity of 3 GBq/g were prepared and the reemission coefficients of tritium from the three types of MS were determined. The effects of storage conditions of the MS on the reemission of tritium were examined. The results show that during two months of storage period, the reemission coefficients of 4A, 5A and 10X MS are (1.9 similar to 5.5) X 10(-6) d(-1)center dot g(-1). Among them, 5A MS has the largest reemission coefficient and 4A MS the smallest. The tritium released from tritium-sorbed MS is mostly in the form of HTO, only less than 1.2% of the tritium is in the form of HT The atmosphere for storing tritium-sorbed MS has rather effect on reemission of tritium. The reemission coefficient in argon is lower than that in Ar + 2%H-2.

The chemical states of SS surface were studied by ITS and the hydrogen isotope retention and its desorption behavior were analyzed by TDS. Two types of surface finish, namely non-pretreated sample and pretreated sample by polish and annealing were prepared. It was found that the oxyhydroxide and hydroxide were formed on the surface layer. The hydrogen isotope desorption stages consisted of three stages, namely the desorption stages from oxyhydroxide, hydroxide and bulk hydrogen. A large amount of deuterium was trapped by the oxy-hydroxide layer for the non-pretreated sample with electrolysis. The hydrogen isotope trapping by this layer would have a large influence on the hydrogen isotope retention. The surface finish would be one of the effective improvement for decreasing its retention on SS.

The films are stored in vacuum-tight metal containers and sampled on a timescale ranging from a day to several months. Analysis is performed with very high sensitivity using static noble gas mass spectrometry. For the first several years, He-3 release is a fairly constant function of helium generation, and does not depend on the amount of helium accumulated in the film. There appears to be somewhat higher helium release at very early times (up to 2%), decreasing over 6 months to a fairly flat value (0.7%). This observation is consistent with a bubble nucleation and growth mechanism. The very early release behavior does not appear to be dependent upon the presence or growth of surface oxide layers.

The range of temperatures investigated is 600-873 K (Sn0.8Li0.2 m.p. similar to 599 K) to maintain single-phase binary melts. The thermodynamic functions of Li-H, Sn-H, Sn-Li are evaluated to derive those of Sn-Li-H. Thus, monotectic solubility data for Sn and Li is analyzed. The calculation is done for high-dilution conditions. A quasi-chemical regular solution model is used for temperature/composition extrapolations when no data is available. The tritium Sievert's constant in Sn0.8Li0.2 at 600 K is: 9.65 10(-8) Pa-1/2 five times the Reiter's measured value for Pb-17Li and similar to 6 times the value in Pb-17Li eutectic obtained by using the same theoretical approach.
