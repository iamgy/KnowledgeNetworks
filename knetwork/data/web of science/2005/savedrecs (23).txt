This work is done to optimize the performance of the ETRR-2 NTD facility based on the standards and to develop a calculation line that can be used during its commercial operating phase. Calculation line methodology was developed using WIMS-134 and CITVAP codes as well as nuclear data file libraries to perform core calculations needed to predict neutronic parameters at the two NTD locations. Axial flux profile was calculated and results were in good agreement with the experimental flux mapping. Based on the calculated variation of the thermal neutron flux axial distribution, it was proposed to displace the silicon ingot axially from its initially proposed position to minimize flux variation. Impact of control rod configuration was analyzed to maximize the neutron flux at the NTD two locations and the best control rod configuration is recommended. Thermal to fast neutron flux was also calculated and concluded that radiation damage caused by fast neutrons can safely be neglected. Flux depression across the ingot was estimated using the ANISN code. Finally, the SIMULINK module of the MATLAB code was used to evaluate the ingot activity due to different radioactive nuclides. The activity was found to reach its exempted limit after 2.79 days after its discharge from the irradiation channel. It was also concluded that the worse ETRR-2 scram will not affect the obtained Si doping and its resistivity. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The intensity of the E'(1) center after heat treatment at 300 degreesC for 15 min (the heat treated E'(1) center) indicates the amount of oxygen vacancies, which are precursors of the E'(1) center. Using this technique, oxygen vacancies were found to be much more stable than other impurity centers, and to be useful for new applications, such as dating of granites, dating of uranium ores, estimating the temperature of heat treatment for stone implements, and provenance of eolian dust. The formation process of the oxygen vacancies in natural quartz has been in debate. Our recent pulsed ESR study indicates that they are probably created by natural beta and gamma rays.

The analysis is limited to the thermal neutron spectrum and low fuel burnup. A simplified model simulating a fuel-run calculation using MCU and MCNP type statistical programs is constructed. This model is used to analyze for a commercial uranium-graphite reactor the effect of the rate of recalculation of and the statistical error in the microscopic cross sections over a run on the calculation of the U-235 and Pu-239 concentrations. The results show that the influence of the statistical error on the computed U-235 and Pu-239 concentration is negligible even with 10(5) neutron histories in the statistical computational sample over a run.

The potential harm of actinides in high-level wastes is calculated taking account of the harm due to their decay products. At the same time, an analogous calculation is performed for the uranium isotopes U-238, U-235, and U-234 consumed in the reactor The value obtained, which depends on the time, can be regarded as the averted harm. The time for establishing radiation equivalence between the high-level wastes and the consumed uranium is determined as the time in which the potential harm from actinides becomes equal to the averted harm. It depends on the holding time of the spent fuel before radiochemical reprocessing. For a 5 yr holding period, it is similar to 49000 yr.

J	Heller, W				Heller, W			New EU radioactive waste transfer directive	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								Euratom Directive 92/3 of February 3, 1992 established in the European Union a system of strict controls and permits of transfers of radioactive waste from one member country into another member country, into the Community and out of the Community. The Waste Transfer Directive supplements the basic norms of health protection of the public and the workforce from the hazards of ionizing radiation, which were updated and enhanced by Euratom Directive 96/29 effective May 13, 2000. By and large, the Waste Transfer Directive and the strict monitoring and control system based on it have proved to function. In its execution, the need for adaptation here and there has arisen over the years. From the Commission's point of view, this justifies the adoption of a new directive which will then replace and supersede the old Directive 92/3. In translating the directive into German law, once it has passed European proceedings and entered into force, German legislators should achieve the simplifications intended by the new directive, the greater legal clarity, and the potential cost savings.									0	0	0	0	0	VERLAGSGRP HANDELSBLATT GMBH	DUSSELDORF	POSTFACH 10 11 02, D-40002 DUSSELDORF, GERMANY	1431-5254			ATW-INT J NUCL POWER	ATW-Int.

The pump limiter is a mechanical boundary that is laid out for taking the full heat load of TEXTOR, namely 8 MW (assuming 2 MW radiated power)for 10 s, and provides a pumping efficiency of at least 5% of the working gas. This layout is adopted from the requirements of a fusion reactor: It is mandatory to remove both the full power that is convected to the limiter or divertor and the helium ash that is generated in the fusion process. In order to obtain pumping for all gases, the ALT-II is equipped with turbomolecular pumps. A short description of ALT-II is given, and the power and particle fluxes to the limiter surface and into the exhaust scoops are discussed. Requirements of the helium removal rate for a reactor and relevant measurements are discussed, and particle removal and the power distribution to the limiters are treated. Related topics of the ALT-II program were hydrogen recycling and the measurement of turbulence-induced anomalous particle transport in the plasma edge.

A characterization of the high-temperature plasma edge is essential to interpret the interaction processes of the different charged and uncharged particles in the boundary layer. In the design of the TEXTOR, much effort was made to optimize diagnostic access to the plasma edge for the best possible characterization. The major part of the plasma edge diagnostics presented here is based on passive and active spectroscopy, in addition to different types of electrical probes. Thereby, pioneering work has been achieved in both fields. In passive emission spectroscopy, the work concentrated on the determination of particle fluxes of different types of atomic (W, Si, C,...) and molecular (D(2), CD, C(2)....) species from the corresponding photon fluxes at different locations and on the visualization of the local impurity sources by means of two-dimensional imaging. The active spectroscopy with atomic beams was focused on the determination of plasma edge parameters (n(e), T(e), T(i),...) with good spatial and temporal resolution. Therefore, different techniques like thermal Li and He beams, suprathermal Li beams-realized by laser blow-off techniques-and hydrogen neutral beam injectors have been employed. Furthermore, laser-induced fluorescence measurements in the ultraviolet and in the vacuum ultraviolet ranges, which were for the first time performed in a fusion plasma, are presented. The continuous improvement of the different plasma edge diagnostics over more than a decade of TEXTOR plasma operation with different types of first-wall materials is discussed.

J	Jones, CG				Jones, CG			A review of the history of US radiation protection regulations, recommendations, and standards	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Review						historical profiles; safety standards; regulations; reviews	CENTENNIAL HARTMAN ORATION; PERSPECTIVE	Shortly after the discovery of x rays by Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen in 1895, and the isolation of the element radium by Pierre and Marie Curie three years later, the fascination' with and potential for an array of uses of ionizing radiation in medicine, science, and technology was born. As with any new technology, there was a need to balance both the beneficial and potential detrimental effects of uses of these new technologies for the advancement of humankind. In the early days, radiation hazards were not well understood. Over the decades increasing concerns in the scientific community and lay population demanded that standardized guidance and recommendations be developed for the use of ionizing radiation. Today, U.S. radiation protection standards and recommendations to protect the occupational worker, members of the general public, and the environment are numerous and complex. This review summarizes the history of the development and application of radiation protection standards and regulations to assure the safe use of radiation and radioactive materials. The evolution and roles of international and national scientific recommending and regulatory organizations that shape U.S. radiation protection policy are described and discussed.

The processes of aerosol deposition, particle transport, absorption, and formation of a fixed deposit in the respiratory tract were formulated in the framework of the Human Respiratory Tract Model described in ICRP Publication 66. The values of parameters governing absorption and formation of the fixed deposit were established by fitting the model to the observations in 530 autopsy cases. The influence of smoking on mechanical clearance of deposited plutonium activity was considered. The dependence of absorption on the aerosol transportability, as estimated by in vitro methods (dialysis), was demonstrated. The results of this stud.), were compared to those obtained from an earlier model of plutonium behavior in the respiratory tract, which was based on the same set of autopsy data. That model did not address the early phases of respiratory clearance and hence underestimated the committed lung dose by about 25% for plutonium oxides. Little difference in lung dose was found for nitrate forms.

Downwind air and ground concentrations and their associated doses from inhalation and ground shine pathways are estimated. The emergency response model (PUFF-PLUME) uses real-time data to track either instantaneous (puff) or continuous (plume) releases. A site-specific ingestion dose model was developed for use with PUFF-PLUME that includes the following ingestion dose pathways pertinent to the surrounding Savannah River Site area: milk, beef, water, and fish. The model is simplistic and can be used with existing code output.

Such experiments require the cooperation and commitment of considerable resources on the part of vendors of the radiation detection systems and the cooperation of a steel mill or scrap processing facility. The results will unavoidably be specific to the equipment tested at the time, the characteristics of the scrap metal involved in the tests, and to the specific configurations of the scrap containers. Given these limitations, the use of computer simulation for this purpose would be a desirable alternative. With this in mind, this study sought to determine whether Monte Carlo simulation of photon flux energy distributions resulting from a radiation source in metal scrap would be realistic. In the present work, experimental and simulated photon flux energy distributions in the outer part of a truck due to the presence of embedded radioactive sources in the scrap metal load are compared. The experimental photon fluxes are deduced by in situ gamma spectrometry measurements with portable Ge detector and the calculated ones by Monte Carlo simulations with the MCNP code. The good agreement between simulated and measured photon flux energy distributions indicate that the results obtained by the Monte Carlo simulations are realistic.

In this paper, the system has been looked at as an example of issues that need to be addressed when evaluating LSO-based system following the recent NEMA NU 2-2001 protocols. The LSO scintillators contain the isotope Lu-176 which is radioactive and creates a small amount of single counts and, depending on the low level discriminator threshold for validated singles, also true coincidence events from a cascade of gamma rays following the beta decay of Lu-176 into Hf-176. The presence of intrinsic random and true coincidence events has an effect on the scatter fraction determination if using the guidelines according to NU 2-2001. We show here that these guidelines have to be changed in order to obtain accurate determination of the scatter fraction. In this paper, we have determined the scatter fraction for different low level discriminator settings. Since the scatter fraction determinations also comprise full count rate studies for the NEMA phantom, we have in addition extracted the sensitivity information for singles, true + scatter, and for the NEC data.

Although previously used in printing and imaging single gamma emitter sources, such techniques have not been, to our knowledge, applied to the manufacturing of positron emitting sources. The added complication in the latter instance is a nonzero positron range and, thus, the need for some attenuating material surrounding the positron emitting atoms. The point sources were first imaged on a phosphor imager and then scanned on three different tomographs (Siemens/CTI ECAT 953B, CPS high-resolution reserach tomograph (HRRT) and Concorde microPET R4) to measure their. point spread functions (PSFs). Where appropriate, the resolution agrees with published values. A comparison of the full width and tenth width half maxima of the point source profiles obtained with and without additional attenuating material showed no effect of the additional attenuation material on their values. The presence of the attenuating material however increased the number of counts in the point source image several fold due to a larger fraction of the positrons annihilating in the region close to the printed source. The results show that printed sources either on paper alone or on paper sandwiched between some additional attenuating material provide a practical means to obtain positron emitting sources.

Lesion detectability and quantification were assessed by a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation approach as a function of different physical factors (e.g., attenuation and scatter), image counting statistics, lesion size and position, lesion-to-background radioactivity concentration ratio (L/B), and reconstruction algorithms. The results of this work brought to a number of conclusions. center dot The MC code PET-electron gamma shower (EGS) was accurate in simulating the physical response of the considered PET/CT scanner (> 90%). center dot PET-EGS and patient-derived phantoms can be used in simulating(18) F-FDG PET oncological studies. Counting statistics is a dominant factor in lesion detectability. center dot Correction for scatter (from both inside and outside the field of view) is needed to improve lesion detectability. center dot Iterative reconstruction and attenuation correction must be used to interpret,clinical images. center dot Re-binning algorithms are appropriate for whole-body oncological data. center dot A MC-based method for correction of partial volume effect is feasible.

J	Liu, YH; Khaimov, D				Liu, YH; Khaimov, D			A geometry- and count-based method for gated SPECT quantification of myocardial thickness, left ventricular volume, and ejection fraction	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						biomedical nuclear imaging; nuclear cardiology; SPECT	SYSTOLIC FUNCTION; PERFUSION; WALL	We present a novel geometry and count-based method for gated single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) quantification to assess myocardial thickness, left ventricular (LV) volume and ejection fraction.(EF). A median search associated with an integrated counts strategy was used to determine the endocardial and epicardial boundaries of the LV. The method was validated using six cardiac phantoms with a wide range of simulated myocardial thickness from 6 mm to 16 mm and LV volume from 33 mL to 128 mL. Tc-99 m radioactive isotope with a concentration of 2.5 mu Ci/mL was injected into the phantoms to simulate normal myocardial perfusion. Solid plastic inserts were placed in the simulated myocardium to mimic dense myocardial perfusion defects. Each cardiac phantom was subsequently submerged into a cylindrical container filled with water simulating uniform photon attenuation. A total of 72 image acquisitions were acquired using two different SPECT cameras. Images were reconstructed, filtered, re-orientated, aligned, and computer animated to generate gated SPECT image sequences. Phantom wall thickness, volume, and ejection fraction were quantified from the gated SPECT images using the new method. Correlations between SPECT quantified and actual values of phantom thickness, volume and ejection fraction were excellent. The quantitative results were not significantly affected by the myocardial perfusion defects simulated, and the results from the two SPECT cameras were highly reproducible. In conclusion, the new method developed is feasible to precisely detect the LV boundaries and may allow for accurate assessments of myocardial thickness, LV volume and ejection fraction.

J	Choong, WS; Moses, WW; Tindall, CS; Luke, PN				Choong, WS; Moses, WW; Tindall, CS; Luke, PN			Design for a high-resolution small-animal SPECT system using pixellated Si(Li) detectors for in vivo I-125 imaging	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						in vivo; iodine-125; lithium-drifted silicon [Si(Li)]; pixellated detector; small-animal; single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)	STRIP DETECTORS; SILICON; TOMOGRAPHY; CAMERAS	We propose a design for a high-resolution single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) system for in vivo (125) I imaging in small animal using pixellated lithium-drifted silicon [Si(Li)] detectors. The proposed detectors are expected to have high interaction probability (>90%), good energy resolution [< 15% full-width at half-maximum (FWHM)], and good intrinsic spatial resolution (similar to 1 mm FWHM). The SPECT system will consist of a dual head detector geometry with the distance between the detectors ranging 30-50 mm to minimize the imaging distance between the mouse and the detectors. The detectors, each with an active area of 64 x 40 mm [64 x 40 array of 1 mm(2) pixels and a 6 mm thick Si(Li) detector], will be mounted on a rotating gantry with an axial field-of-view of 64 mm. The detector signals will be read out by custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Using a high-resolution parallel-hole collimator, the expected spatial resolution is 1.6 mm. FWHM at an imaging distance of 20 mm, and sensitivity is 6.7 cps/mu Ci. 1251 is a readily available radioisotope with a long half-life of 59.4 days and it is commonly used to label biological compounds in molecular biology. Conventional gamma cameras are not optimized to detect the low emission energies (27 to 35 keV) of (125) I. However, Si(Li) detector provides an ideal solution for detecting the low-energy emissions of I-125. In addition to presenting the design of the system, this paper presents a feasibility study of using Si(Li) detectors to detect the emissions of I-125.

Combined images of anaesthetized mice bearing a surface solid tumor are presented. The fluorescent marker is a hematoporphyrin compound laser-excited with green light and imaged in the red fluorescence emission with a standard monochrome charge coupled device (CCD) camera. The gamma-ray (Tc-99m) pinhole imaging system uses a semiconductor pixel detector obtained by hybridizing a Silicon (300-mu m thick) or a CdTe (1-mm thick) pixel detector to the Medipix2 (55-mu m pitch) readout integrated circuit for single photon counting. The acquisition of combined images of the tumor area (fluorescence: animal top view; radionuclide: bottom view) shows that the tumor area can be imaged in a few minutes, with a few millimeter resolution (I-mm pinhole diameter), radioactively (Tc-99m MIBI, 74 MBq), and with the optical system. Combined imaging revealed also a different uptake of the two types of tumors studied (one grown from anaplastic human, thyroid carcinoma-derived cells, the other from human papillary carcinoma-derived cells). Future,progress will be toward a more compact optical setup and the use of a thicker CdTe detector.

The neutron radiography tests were performed by NIP and NCT methods at the 2nd Thermal Neutron Radiography Facility (TNRF-2) in the Japan Research Reactor (JRR)-3. In the NIP image of the fuel rod, the difference in the size, shape, and enrichment between the UO2 pellets is obviously recognized. In the case of NCT method, the images clearly show the detailed shape of the cross section in both enriched and natural pellets, and difference in the enrichment between those pellets is also observed. In addition, size difference between fuel parts of specifications and those in NCT images is evaluated.

In the design, Monte Carlo code (MCNP) was employed to generate neutron and gamma-ray beams suited to LINGR. With a view to variable neutron spectrum and neutron intensity, various arrangements were first examined, and neutron-filter, gamma-ray shield, and beam collimator were verified. Monte Carlo calculations indicated that with a suitable filter-shield-collimator arrangement, thermal neutron beam of 3900 ncm(-2)s(-1) with neutron/gamma ratio of 7 x 10(7), and 25 ncm(-2)s(-1) with very large neutron/gamma ratio, respectively, could be produced by using a Cf-252 (122 mu g) and a Am-241 - Be (37 GBq) radioisotopes at the irradiation port of 35 cm from the neutron sources.

Boron is the important absorber used for the production of boron-alloyed steel to serve in long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel or nuclear waste disposals. Due to the high neutron absorption of boron compared to steel, the neutron radiography is a powerful tool for the nondestructive investigation. This paper concerns quantitative estimations of secondary effects on the neutron transmission measurements through thermal neutron shielding materials such as beam hardening, background, and inhomogeneous absorber distribution within the samples, which decrease the neutron attenuation in absorber materials. Neutron transmission measurements have been performed for boron-alloyed steel plates having different thickness using thermal neutrons. The investigated samples are from the Austrian Steel Production Company Bohler Bleche GmbH, which uses natural boron in the form of boron carbide within the steel matrix. The attenuation coefficients of boron-alloyed steels were measured with neutron radiography and the special neutron transmission set-up "JEN-3," which is used for routine test measurements of shielding materials by the Austrian Steel Production Company Bohler Bleche GmbH. In addition to the transmission measurements, Monte Carlo Neutron Particle (MCNP) simulations were performed for better understanding and interpretation of the obtained experimental results. This is the first step of our study covering the estimation of some secondary effects on the neutron transmission. Further experiments will be continued using different absorber materials and homogeneity distribution in order to verify afore said factors in the transmission experiments of neutron shielding materials.

Comparative calculations showed that the WIMS/RFSP/ROVER code system produced results consistent with the current design code system for estimating the ROP TSP of the standard natural uranium CANDU reactor. For the DUPIC fuel CANDU core, the ROP TSP was estimated to be 123.4%, which was almost the same as that of the standard natural uranium core. The extra margin of the ROP TSP for the DUPIC fuel system was enhanced by the flattened axial channel power distribution as well as the reduced refueling ripple of the channel power. This study has shown that the DUPIC fuel does not deteriorate the current ROP TSP designed for the natural uranium CANDU reactor.

J	Utsunomiya, S; Yudintsev, S; Ewing, RC				Utsunomiya, S; Yudintsev, S; Ewing, RC			Radiation effects in ferrate garnet	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							BEAM-INDUCED AMORPHIZATION; ION-BEAM; CERAMIC MATERIALS; NUCLEAR-WASTE; IRRADIATION; MINERALS; ZIRCON; IMMOBILIZATION; SPECTROSCOPY; PLUTONIUM	Radiation effects in four synthetic ferrate garnets (A(3)B(2)(XO4)(3), Ia(3)d, Z = 8) were examined by ion beam irradiations with in situ observation (T = 298-873 K) using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at the IVEM Tandem Facility at Argonne National Laboratory. The garnet compositions include: A = Ca, Gd, Th, and Ce; B = Zr, Fe. The critical amorphization temperatures (T-c), the temperature above which the target material cannot be amorphized due to dynamic annealing, were between 820 and 870K. The amorphization doses at room temperature are between 0.17 and 0.19dpa (displacement per atom), which is similar to that of silicate- and aluminate-garnets. The small variations in the amorphization dose and T-c of the different compositions suggest that radiation effects in ferrate garnets are structurally constrained. Qualitative analyses of the valence states of Ce and Fe in garnet before and after irradiation were completed using electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). The Cc and Fe in the unirradiated garnet were dominantly trivalent and divalent, respectively. The characteristic peaks of Ce4+, at similar to5 eV higher energy for the M-edges, were present in unirradiated garnet as a minor peak, and the peaks did not disappear after complete amorphization, suggesting that the valence state did not change significantly. EELS analysis was conducted on a nearly pure and radite, Ca3Fe2Si3O12, which ideally contains only ferric iron. The andradite was amorphized at 0.18 dpa. EELS analysis revealed that some of ferric iron was converted to ferrous iron during the irradiation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hibi, K; Sekimoto, H				Hibi, K; Sekimoto, H			Investigation of neutron reaction behavior in water-cooled FBR with MOX fuel	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						innovative water reactor; fast breeder reactor; reaction rate spectrum; light and heavy water cooling; void reactivity; breeding performance		A water-cooled FBR with MOX fuel is under development using current LWR technologies and its design targets are to achieve a BR value, which is a ratio of a fissile plutonium content in a spent fuel to one in a fresh fuel, larger than 1.0 and to obtain a negative void reactivity. This study has been performed to clarify the reasons why the water-cooled FBR has high sensitivities for core specifications. The water-cooled FBR must reduce an X/HM, which is a ratio of hydrogen or deuteron to heavy metal atomic number densities in a unit core volume, to about 0.2 for light water cooling case and 1.0 for heavy water case to attain the required breeding performance. Although the water-cooled FBR is a fast reactor, typical neutron energy values are about 0.4 keV for the former case and about 13 keV for the latter case, and such relatively soft neutron spectra compared with the sodium-cooled FBR one give significant differences on nuclear performance. The water-cooled FBR has a positive void reactivity due to the dynamic reaction rate spectrum changes from normal to voided conditions, named neutron spectrum shift effect. The spectrum shift gives a negative void reactivity in depleted UO2 fuel, so the optimization of the fuel arrangements among the MOX fuel reduces the void reactivity.

And the intrinsic feature of proliferation resistance of plutonium has been discussed based on IAEA's publication and Kessler's proposal. The analytical results show that not only Pu-238 but also other plutonium isotopes with even-mass-number have very important role for denaturing of plutonium due to their relatively large critical mass and noticeably high spontaneous fission neutron generation. With the changes of the minor-actinide doping ratio in U-Pu mix oxide fuel and moderator to fuel ratio, it is found that the reactor-grade plutonium from conventional light water reactors can be denatured to satisfy the proliferation resistance criterion based on the Kessler's proposal but not to be sufficient for the criterion based on IAEA's publication.

Then, it is important to grasp the behavior of tritiated water for preserving of the radiation safety. The mass transfer behavior of tritium from air to water through the water surface was discussed in this study. The evaporation rate of water and the condensation rate of water were experimentally examined from measurement of change of the weight of distilled water. The tritium transfer rate from the tritiated water in air to the distilled water was also experimentally examined by using a liquid scintillation counter. Experimental results about change of tritium level in a small beaker placed in the atmosphere with tritiated water showed that diffusion of tritium in water and gas flow in the atmosphere gives considerable effect on tritium transfer. The estimation method of the tritium transfer made in this study was applied to explain the data at The Japan Atomic Power Company second power station at Tsuruga and good agreement was obtained.

In this study, oxide films and crack tips on cold-worked 316SS exposed to hydrogenated high-temperature water were characterized using analytical transmission electron microscopy (ATEM), grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) in order to study the corrosion and SCC behaviors of these films and crack tips. A double layer structure was identified for the oxide film after a constant extension rate tensile (CERT) test. The outer layer was composed of large particles (0.2-3 mu m) of Fe3O4 and the inner layer consisted mainly of fine particles (similar to 10nm) of FeCr2O4. In addition, nickel enrichment was identified at the metal/oxide interface. Particles of Fe3O4 were also identified on the crack walls. These results indicate that the same electrochemical reactions had occurred inside and outside the crack. The crack tip area was filled with corrosion products of a chromium-rich oxide. In addition, nickel enrichment was observed at the crack tip. The formation of the nickel-enriched phase indicates that a selective dissolution reaction of iron and chromium occurred at the front of the LPSCC crack.

This led the authors to study how the maximum possible radon emanation coefficient (hereafter referred to as 'maximum radon emanation probability') could be determined. Theoretical calculations were repeated in which the grain configuration was changed in order to get the maximum radon emanation probability. Two types of grains were targeted. The first type consisted of two components mixed together; one component was a large amount of mother grains including no radium and the other component was a small amount of very fine grains including radium. For this type, the maximum radon emanation probability was obtained as 0.75. The second type consisted of only one grain component including radium. For this type, the maximum radon emanation probability was 0.625. In both types, the high coefficients were attributed to the extremely small size of the radium-bearing grains. This finding hinted at a possible countermeasure to suppress radon emanation, i.e., sintering at a rather low temperature, which may best be fitted to industries which process naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM).

Solutions and solid materials are periodically sampled and subsequently analyzed to determine concentrations of groundwater and fuel components in these materials to elucidate corrosion mechanisms. The analyses are performed primarily by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). For ICP- MS we use the method of internal standardization with direct external calibration with multi-elemental standards possessing natural isotopic abundances for the determination of concentrations groundwater components and indirect instrumental response calibration for the determination of fuel components. Additionally, we are utilizing high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HR-ICP-MS) to enhance our ability to determine concentrations of low-solubility actinides at ultratrace concentrations.

The isotopic composition of fissiogenic lanthanide elements was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ICP-MS detection. These analytical results allow the determination of fuel burn-up based on Nd-148, Pu, and U content, as well as provide input for storage and disposal criticality calculations. Results show that ICP-MS along with HPLC-ICP-MS are suitable of performing routine determinations of most of these nuclides, with an uncertainty of +/- 10% at the 95% confidence level.

However, the chemical analysis of both radioactive and non-radioactive components in nuclear waste can be challenged by high radiation dose rates. In many cases, reduction of dose rates through dilution compromises the precision and sensitivity for certain key components. The use of neutron activation analysis provides a method of analysis which avoids the need for dilutions or extensive sample preparation. The recently developed analysis process is traced with iron-manganese wire referenced to weight per cent sodium standards. The procedures uses a nominal 80 mg Cf-252 neutron source to activate the natural sodium to Na-24, followed by gamma-energy analysis. Assay of direct waste samples containing weight per cent sodium has shown precision of less than one per cent standard deviation of total propagated uncertainty.

In the present work, a chromatographic separation of trivalent actinides (Am and Cm) and rare earth elements was examined in hydrochloric acid/methanol mixed solvents by using a pyridine resin embedded in high-porous silica beads. In a 70 vol% hydrochloric acid (11.7 mol HCl/dm(3))/30 vol% methanol mixed solvent, the elution curves of the trivalent actinides were separated completely from those of rare earth elements at room temperature. The present paper discusses the separation behavior of trivalent actinides and rare earth elements as a function of flow rate, temperature and solvent compositions.

In October 2001, sonic drilling was conducted to recover core samples around and below the tank location. This paper describes the measurements and investigative approaches being pursued to determine the transport properties of the various fission and daughter products and actinides. Separate effects laboratory experiments are also being conducted involving both inert and radioactive samples in similar soil, to examine the effects on transport properties (diffusion and sorption) of temperature, recharge and discharge rates, concentration and soil porosity. Finally, transport modeling approaches are discussed.

The overall analysis approach is based on a fully automated wet radiochemical analysis method. Microwave-assisted sample oxidation is used prior to a chemical separation step in order to oxidize all of the non-pertechnetate species to pertechnetate. Separation of the pertechnetate from interfering radioactive and stable matrix species is carried out using an anion-exchange column. The separate Tc-99 is quantified using a flow-through solid cell scintillation detector. The instrument is capable of an analysis time of < 13 minute per sample with a detection limit of 2000 dpm/ml. Nuclear waste samples from the Hanford site with a high content of non-pertechnetate species were successfully analyzed using this method.

It uses ion chromatography for elemental selectivity and flow-through scintillation counting with dual parameter pulse-height and pulse-shape analysis for alpha/beta detection and discrimination. The system was tested for one surrogate sample (spiked groundwater from the southeastern U.S.) and two actual samples from the Savannah River Site (supernatant from a high activity drain tank and sludge from a high level waste tank). For the spiked groundwater, recoveries were quantitative for all of the analytes (americium, curium, plutonium, and strontium) except uranium. For the actual samples, which contained americium, curium, plutonium, strontium, and cesium, the results using the system were within 20% of those obtained independently. Based on these tests, it is concluded that the system is capable of analyzing alpha- and beta-emitting radionuclides in samples that are representative of those encountered at contaminated former weapons sites.

J	Lee, JH; Lim, JM; Kim, KH				Lee, JH; Lim, JM; Kim, KH			Instrumental neutron activation analysis of elemental compositions in particles collected during Asian Dust period	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							LONG-RANGE TRANSPORT; AEROSOLS; KOREA; AREA	Instrumental neutron activation analysis was conducted on PM 10 samples collected in Daejeon city, Korea during September 2001 to May 2002. Our measurement data were analyzed to explain the behavior of particle-bound elemental components in relationship with Asian Dust (AD) events. The results of our analysis indicated that the major crustal elements (e.g., Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, and Ti) showed strong enrichment (about 3 to 9 times higher concentration levels) during the AD period accompanied by the increase in the PM 10 levels (e.g., by about 3 times). However, the concentrations of anthropogenically derived elements (such as As, Br, Sb, Se and Zn) exhibited moderate change during the AD period. Hence, the computation of enrichment factor (EF) indicated that the magnitude of EF values during the AD period was even smaller in the case of toxic metals than its non-AD counterpart. The existence of relatively low EF values during the AD period can be attributed to the excessive input of crustal components. The overall results of our study suggest that both absolute and relative elemental composition of aerosol particles can be altered significantly by the AD events.

The evaluation of the enrichment factors may provide information for many elements about their association to long-distance atmospheric transport phenomena. To this purpose, samples of superficial soils, collected in the same areas of those of the lichens, have also been analyzed.

J	Warnecke, E				Warnecke, E			Decommissioning strategy selection	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article								At the end of their useful life nuclear facilities have to be decommissioned. The strategy, selection on how to decommission a facility is a highly important decision at the very beginning of decommissioning planning. Basically, a facility may be subject to (a) immediate dismantling; (b) deferred dismantling after a period of "safe enclosure" or (c) entombment where a facility is turned into a near surface disposal facility. The first two strategies are normally applied. The third one may be accepted in countries without significant nuclear activities and hence without disposal facilities for radioactive waste. A large number of factors has to be taken into account when a decision on the decommissioning strategy is being made. Many of the factors cannot be quantified. They may be qualitative or subject to public opinion which may change with time. At present, a trend can be observed towards immediate dismantling of nuclear facilities, mainly because it is associated with less uncertainty, less local impact, a better public acceptance, and the availability of operational expertise and know how. A detailed evaluation of the various factors relevant to strategy, selection and a few examples showing the situation regarding decommissioning strategy in a number of selected countries are presented in the following article.

All over the world, these technologies as well as conditioning processes of decommissioning waste are further developed. So far, they have been mainly applied to the dismantling of research and prototype facilities. Dismantling of reactors of higher power has started with the nuclear power plants of Greifswald and Wurgassen among others. The present paper shall present the state of the art of decontamination and dismantling techniques as well as of post-treatment processes of radioactive decommissioning waste. From the technical point of view, the most complex step is the remote dismantling of activated and highly contaminated components. The prototype facilities of Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, which are currently being dismantled, cover all types of plants. Their status of dismantling and the experience gained from using decommissioning technologies that are also suited for power facilities shall be illustrated. Further developments and adaptations of individual techniques, e. g. thermal and mechanical cutting methods, as well as of the complete systems technology, including carrier system, manipulator system, and tools, are reasonable and indispensable for managing the variety of dismantling tasks and, not least, for reducing their operation times and costs of use.

J	Thierfeldt, S				Thierfeldt, S			The role of clearance in Germany - release of materials, buildings and sites	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article								Clearance in Germany is far advanced. A complex regulatory framework exists in the Radiation Protection Ordinance (RPO/Strahlenschutzverordnung, StrlSchV) since 2001 which has replaced previous recommendations on clearance issued by, the German Radiation Protection Commission (Strahlenschutzkommission, SSK). A number of options exist both for unconditional clearance (e. g. of all kinds of materials with no restrictions on the destination or future use) and for clearance for a specific purpose (e. g. recycling of metal scrap). For each clearance option there is a set of nuclide specific clearance levels which have been derived on the basis of the 10 Sv/a individual dose criterion using complex radiological models which are tailored to the respective material cycles (metal scrap, buildings, building rabble, waste for disposal, sites). The clearance levels have been thoroughly reviewed by the SSK. An extensive comparison to sets of clearance levels used in other countries or issued as guidance by international bodies revealed that the correspondence between values is between good and acceptable taking into account country-specific approaches and special assumptions which would not necessarily pertain to German situations. Clearance is a major factor in the material management, especially of nuclear installations undergoing decommissioning. The variety of clearance options leaves the operator of a nuclear installation sufficient flexibility for optimisation of the material management. Clearance is of particular importance in a country like Germany where the estimated costs for a future repository are very high and the interim storage facilities for radioactive material are limited and costly. While the licensee is responsible for his material management, the issuance of a clearance permit is done by the regulatory; body upon application. The regulators may choose to use the clearance levels and regulations as stipulated by the RPO, or to impose site-specific regulations on the licensee. The actual clearance measurement, i.e. checking the compliance of the residual radionuclide content in or on a particular material, building or site with the clearance levels, is performed under the responsibility of the licensee's appointed radiation protection officer, with additional checks usually made by the regulator or an independent expert acting on his behalf After compliance verification, the material will be reused, recycled or disposed of according to the clearance option, being then subject to the conventional waste legislation.

J	Dagbjartsson, S				Dagbjartsson, S			Decommissioning of bacwk-end nuclear facilities	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article								Concerning the decommissioning of facilities related to reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel and processing and disposal of radioactive waste, i.e., facilities for waste conditioning or storage, specific features prevail. Such facilities are generally optimised for the handling of radioactive substances and, therefore, are frequently highly contaminated, but do not contain any activated material. One main concern of their decommissioning will usually be the decontamination of extended surfaces of process equipment and building structures. Depending on the extent and success of the decontamination, dismantling tasks might have to be remotely performed. Based on a survey of the number of such facilities, typical issues associated with their decommissioning were found to be well presented by focussing on the examples of the decommissioning of the two prototype spent fuel reprocessing plants at Dessel/Belgium and Karlsruhe/Germany. Such issues are mainly associated with the presence of alpha-contamination of the process equipment and large building structures. Experience gained from solving associated problems is discussed.

J	Hagen, M; Kunze, C; Schmidt, P				Hagen, M; Kunze, C; Schmidt, P			Decommissioning and rehabilitation of uranium and thorium production facilities	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article								The use of nuclear energy for military as well as for peaceful purposes was and remains closely connected with the mining and processing of uranium ore and, to a lesser extent, of thorium ore. Mining and processing of radioactive ores are characterised by the generation of huge amounts of radioactive residues, massive impacts upon ecosystems, landscape reshaping (or devastation in some places), and the monostructural socio-economic orientation of human settlement areas. However, a great number of the mines and mills commissioned during the cold war have been already closed, either for deposits being depleted of economically recoverable resources or on political grounds. The specifics of uranitum/tthorium mining and milling make high demands on the decommissioning and rehabilitation of the facilities which in addition to radiological aspects would have to address issues such as water pollution control and soil conservation, future site re-use, landscaping, and infrastructure development. The present paper gives an overview of the state of decommissioning and rehabilitation. Radiological specifics and their integration into the decommissioning and rehabilitation management are demonstrated for the rehabilitation of uranium mining legacies in Saxony and Thuringia.
