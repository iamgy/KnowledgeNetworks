The U-234/U-238 atom ratio in the water samples varied from 51 x 10(-6) to 252 x 10(-6) whereas in secular equilibrium (i.e., unity activity ratio) the ratio is 54.9 x 10(-6). The correlation of the U-234/U-238 ratio between hair and nail samples was 0.98, and between hair and nails and urine the ratio was 0.91 and 0.89, respectively. The correlation of the ratio between water and the hair or nails was 0.97 but only 0.72 for water and urine, possibly due to spectral interferences. These results conclusively demonstrated that the uranium found in the bioassays can be traced to the drinking water, thus providing a direct link to the source of exposure. Hair may serve as an excellent indicator of occupational or environmental exposure to uranium and provide information regarding its source. Bioassay of hair is attractive as it is an effective bio-concentrator, samples can be easily stored, the concentration reflects an integrated value, and, finally, the measurement of the U-234/U-238 isotopic ratio in digested hair samples by MC-ICPMS is feasible and highly informative. Hair bioassay can also be used to assess exposure to depleted uranium long after the subjects have left the area suspected of contamination.

This was accomplished through the application of two different computational approaches. The first was based on the assumption that ground (drinking) water was the only source of intake of C-14 and I-129, as well as stable carbon and stable iodine. In the second, the intake of C-14 and I-129 was still assumed to be restricted to that in the ground (drinking) water, but the intake of stable carbon and stable iodine was expanded to include that in other components of the diet. The doses were estimated using either a conversion formula or the applicable dose coefficients in Federal Guidance Reports No. 11 and No. 13. Serving as input for the analyses was the estimated maximum concentrations of C or I-129 that would be present in the ground water due to potential releases from the proposed Yucca Mountain high-level radioactive waste repository during the first 10,000 y after closure. The estimated contributions of stable carbon and iodine through the consumption of ground water were based on analyses of samples collected in the Amargosa Valley, NV. The contributions through dietary intake were based on surveys conducted in the United States. Based on the accompanying analyses, it was noted that stable isotope intake has a significant effect on the estimated doses due to the intake of radioactive isotopes of the same element. While this is a well-known fact, this observation has international implications in terms of dose estimates for key radionuclides, such as C-14 and I-129, a primary reason being the wide variations in the intakes of stable carbon and iodine in various countries. For this reason, analysts planning to apply the dose coefficients developed by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) should either confirm that the average total intake in their country of stable isotope(s) of the radioactive isotope being evaluated is in reasonable agreement with the value assumed by the ICRP or suitably modify the ICRP dose coefficients to account for any differences. If such a procedure is to be implemented, there is a need for periodic updates of the dietary intakes of various stable elements in countries throughout the world. The importance of this is documented by recent surveys in Asia that revealed that their average total daily intake of stable iodine was less than half of the ICRP value for Reference Man. In this case, application of the ICRP dose coefficients, without modification, would underestimate the dose due to ingested I-129 by a factor of more than two. A related situation exists in the United States where the latest surveys indicate that the daily intake of stable iodine is 75% of the ICRP value.

J	Cohen, BL				Cohen, BL			Understanding the toxicity of buried radioactive waste and its impacts	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						waste disposal; environmental transport; exposure; population; risk analysis	RISK ANALYSIS	The oral ingestion toxicities of buried high level radioactive waste from nuclear power plants and of the natural radioactivity in the ground are calculated and expressed as cancer doses, the number of fatal cancers predicted by the linear no-threshold theory if all of the material were fed to people. Unless the size of the U.S. nuclear power industry is greatly expanded, there will probably never be more than 2 trillion cancer doses (CD) in U.S. repositories, as compared with 31 trillion CD in the ground above them. Measurements of the uranium, thorium, and radium in human bodies indicate that the latter cause 500 deaths per year in U.S. The great majority of this material is derived from the top few meters of soil that are penetrated by plant roots. It is concluded that the annual number of U.S. deaths from buried nuclear wastes will be about 1.0 (or less), orders of magnitude less than the number from coal burning electricity generation, the principal competitor of nuclear power.

J	Kim, KP; Wu, CY; Birky, BK; Bolch, WE				Kim, KP; Wu, CY; Birky, BK; Bolch, WE			Effective dose scaling factors for use with cascade impactor sampling data in tenorm inhalation exposures	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						inhalation; scaling; uranium; decay chain	PARTICLE-SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS; RADIOACTIVE AEROSOLS	When assessing the effective dose to workers following radio-aerosol inhalation exposures, significant reductions in dose uncertainty can be achieved through direct measurement of the particle-size distribution. The University of Washington Mark III cascade impactor is one such air sampling device that permits the user to determine aerosol mass and radioactivity concentrations as a function of particle size within eight different size intervals (each corresponding to a different impactor stage or end filter). Traditionally, dose assessments made using the LUDEP code or other internal dosimetry software utilize this air sampling information by assigning the radioactivity measured at each stage as concentrated at a single representative size central to the size interval. In this study, we explore more realistic assumptions that the measured radioactivity distributes uniformly, linearly increases, or linearly decreases across the particle size interval for each impactor stage. The concept of an effective dose scaling factor, SFE, is thus introduced whereby (1) the former approach can be used (which requires less computational effort using the LUDEP code), and (2) the resulting values of effective dose per stage can then be rescaled to values appropriate to a linear radioactivity distribution per stage. For a majority of U-218-series radionuclides, particle size ranges, and absorption classes, differences in these two approaches are less than 10%, and thus no corrections in effective dose per particle stage are needed. Significant corrections, however, were noted in select cases. For uniform or linearly decreasing radioactivity distributions, end-filter particles (0.03 to 0.35 mu m) of type F, M, or S radionuclides were assigned values of SFE ranging from 1.15 to 1.44, while 3(rd) stage particles (4.5 to 1.2 mu m) of type M and S radionuclides were assigned values of SF, ranging from 1.11 to 1.53. When the cascade impactor measurements indicate a linear increase of activity across a given impactor-stage size range, values of SF, range from a high of 1.11(6(th) stage particles of type F radionuclides) to lows of 0.85 to 0.91 (4(th) stage and end-filter particles of type M and S radionuclides). In these cases, the inhalation dose coefficient varies non-linearly across the particle size range, and the assumption of a mono-size distribution per impactor stage either underestimates (SFE > 1) or overestimates (SFE < 1) that stage's contribution to the worker effective dose.

The system has been calibrated with the same lung set and phantom that was used to calibrate the Human Monitoring Laboratory's previous lung counting system and the Cameco Corporation's mobile lung counter. The performance characteristics (efficiency and sensitivity) of all three systems are compared, with the Human Monitoring Laboratory's new system being more sensitive than the other systems by factor of 1.3. The large area detectors highlight the design deficiency of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's torso phantom, namely short lungs, as the lower two detectors are over inactive tissue (similar to 40%). As a result, both a two-detector and a three-detector array are actually more sensitive than a four-detector array in certain circumstances. This is, however, an unrealistic finding as human lungs are much longer (similar to 10 cm) than the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's phantom's lungs. The dosimetric implications of the new system's minimum detectable activities are put into perspective using Co-57, U-235, U-238, Pu-239, Am-241, and natural uranium as example radionuclides.

Combining exploratory techniques has the tremendous advantage to record simultaneously complementary parameters on the same animal. In this field, an exciting challenge remains in the combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and positron emission tomography (PET) since small animals studies are limited by strict technical constraints in vivo. Coupling NMR with a radiosensitive beta-MicroProbe offers therefore an interesting technical alternative. To assess the feasibility of this new dual-modality system, we designed theoretical and experimental approaches to test the ability of the beta-Microprobe to quantify radioactivity concentration in an intense magnetic field. In an initial step, simulations were carried out using Geant4. First, we evaluated the influence of a magnetic field on the probe detection volume. Then, the detection sensitivity and energy response of the probe were quantified. In a second step, experiments were run within a 7-T magnet to confirm our simulations results. We showed that using the probe in magnetic fields leads to a slight attenuation in sensitivity and an increase of the scintillation light yield. These data demonstrate the feasibility of combining NMR to the,beta-MicroProbe.

Herein, we present the latest hardware configuration of the VTS, a test of the accuracy of motion tracking by it, and our solution for synchronization between the SPECT and the optical acquisitions. The current version of the VTS includes stereo imaging with sets of optical network cameras with attached light sources, a SPECT/VTS calibration phantom, a black stretchable garment with reflective spheres to track chest motion, and a computer to control the cameras. The computer also stores the JPEG files generated by the optical cameras with synchronization to the list-mode acquisition of events on our SPECT system. Five Axis PTZ 2130 network cameras (Axis Communications AB, Lund, Sweden) were used to track motion of spheres with a highly retroreflective coating using stereo methods. The calibration phantom is comprised of seven reflective spheres designed such that radioactivity can be added to the tip of the mounts holding the spheres. This phantom is used to determine the transformation to be applied to convert the motion detected by the VTS into the SPECT coordinates system. The ability of the VTS to track motion was assessed by comparing its results to those of the Polaris infrared tracking system (Northern Digital Inc., Waterloo, ON, Canada). The difference in the motions assessed by the two systems was generally less than 1 rum. Synchronization was assessed in two ways. First, optical cameras were aimed at a digital clock and the elapsed time estimated by the cameras was compared to the actual time shown by the clock in the images. Second, synchronization was also assessed by moving a radioactive and reflective sphere three times during concurrent VTS and SPECT acquisitions and comparing the time at which motion occurred in the optical and SPECT images. The results show that optical and SPECT images stay synchronized within a 150-ms range. The 100-Mbit network load is less than 10%, and the computer's CPU load is between 15% and 25%; thus, the VTS can be improved by adding more cameras or by increasing the image size and/or resolution while keeping an acquisition rate of 30 images per second per camera.

J	Pierrat, N; de Carlan, L; Cavadore, D; Franck, D				Pierrat, N; de Carlan, L; Cavadore, D; Franck, D			Application of Monte Carlo calculation for the virtual calibration of a low-energy in vivo counting system	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						germanium detectors; lung counting; Monte Carlo methods; numerical calibration	PHANTOMS; RADIOACTIVITY; LUNGS	Internal dose assessment can be derived from the measurement of retained activity in the whole body or in an organ at a given time. In radiation protection, this assessment, so-called in vivo measurement, is performed by an external measurement of the subject with germanium detectors (in most cases). Calibration of these detectors is ensured by anthropomorphic phantoms which, for technical reasons, can only provide rough representations of human. It is especially the case for the chest phantoms used in lung counting, subject of this paper. This leads to substantial corrections on calibration factors that are particularly crucial and delicate in low-energy in vivo measurements, resulting in important systematic errors. In order to improve calibration, former work based on numerical phantoms associated with Monte Carlo computing techniques has already proven its benefits. To go further, a Graphical User Interface called "OEDIPE", a French acronym for "tool for internal personalized dose assessment", has been developing at the IRSN internal dose assessment laboratory, simulating real measurements using person-specific computational phantoms in association with MCNP calculation code. The study presented here is dedicated to the implementation and validation of a real in vivo monitoring system (AREVA/COGEMA Marcoule, France) equipped with 4 high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors. After modeling the facility and measurement geometry using OEDIPE (design and positioning of the detectors...), validation with different configurations was carried out in two steps: first with point sources (different nuclides, different source-detector distances) and then with the Livermore calibration phantom (different overlay plates, lungs contaminated with... Am and a mixture of actinides). The final goal is to approach a personalized numerical calibration of the facilities in order to improve dose assessment, as the use of physical phantoms for calibration induces large uncertainties. Such application could be an opening door on a better activity assessment in nuclear medicine, especially in personalized dosimetry in radioimmunotherapy.

An event is considered as a coincidence when a photon emitted from a radioactive source is first Compton scattered in the SDD where the recoil electron deposits its energy and the scattered photon undergoes a photoelectric absorption in the NaI(Tl) crystal of the Anger camera. The SDD is composed of a monolithic array of 19 hexagonal cells each having an on-chip transistor which provides the first stage amplification. (137)Cs source has been finely collimated in order to study events occuring at different locations within a single cell. The equipment is designed such that the measurements can be done in all detector orientations and kinematical conditions. The angular and energy distribution of coincidence events have been studied with high statistics. Energy resolution and angle measurements performed with this detector system will be presented in this paper.

PEM was performed using two opposite block detectors of the PEImager without rotating). One projection image or several focal-plane images were obtained by dual-head imaging, because the number of line of response (LOR) to be reconstructed into tomograms by conventional sinogram-based reconstruction methods is limited. In this work, an iterative algebraic reconstruction was employed to reconstruct projection data to obtain a tomogram. The locations and sizes of hot spots in a breast phantom can be interpreted using such planar tomography, considering the efficiency of detector elements, attenuation and geometric factors. Spheres with diameters of 3 mm, 5 min, 8 min and 10 mm were inserted into a cylindrical phantom simulated tumors embedded in the background with different radioactivities, to evaluate the tumor detection capacity capability of tumor detection. For an 80-mm-depth phantom with a 20:1 tumor-to-normal tissue radioactivity ratio, a tumor with a diameter of 3 mm can be detected using planar tomography, while a 5-mm-diameter and 10-mm-diameter tumors can be detected in the ratios 10:1 and 5:1, respectively. The images of planar tomography have better contrast than focal-plane reconstruction, and have greater tumor-detection capacity ability.

J	Hawari, AI; Chen, JW				Hawari, AI; Chen, JW			Computational investigation of on-line interrogation of pebble bed reactor fuel	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						assay; burnup; enrichment; fuel; gamma-ray; nuclear reactor; pebble bed reactor	GAMMA-RAY SPECTROMETRY	Pebble bed reactors are characterized by multipass fuel systems in which spherical fuel pebbles are circulated through the core until they reach a proposed burnup limit (80 000-100 000 MWD/MTU). For such reactors, the fuel is assayed on-line to ensure that the burnup limit is not breached. We considered assaying the fuel using an HPGe detector to perform passive gamma-ray spectrometry of fission products. Since neither fresh nor irradiated fuel is readily available, computer simulations were utilized to identif-il the radionuclides that can be used as burnup indicators, and to visualize the gamma-ray spectra at various levels of burnup. Specifically9 we used the ORIGEN-MONTEBURNS-MCNP code system. This allowed the establishment of the burnup dependent one-group gas reactor cross-sections for the radionuclides of interest. Subsequently, ORIGEN was used to simulate in-core pebble depletion to establish the irradiated pebble isotopics. Finally, the codes MCNP and SYNTH were used to simulate the response of the HPGe gamma-ray spectrometer. The results show that absolute and relative indicators can be used on-line to determine unambiguously the enrichment and burnup on a pebble-by-pebble basis. The activity of Cs-137 or the activity ratio of Co-60/Cs-134 can be combined with the activity ratio of Np-239/1-132 to yield the enrichment and burnup information. To use the relative indicators, a relative efficiency calibration of the gamma-ray spectrometer can be performed using the La-140 gamma lines that are emitted by the irradiated pebble. I-132, Cs-134, Cs-137, La-140, and Np-239 are produced upon the irradiation of the fuel. Co-60 is produced by doping the fuel with a small amount (similar to 100 ppm) of Co-59. Using this approach, the uncertainty in burnup determination due to factors such as power history variation, detector efficiency calibration, and counting statistics is expected to remain in the range of +/- 5% to +/- 10%.

The two cases differ in their treatment of background radiation and its influence on detection sensitivity. Stationary detectors are limited by the statistical fluctuation of the background, while moving detectors may be subjected to widely and irregularly varying background radiation as a result of geographical and environmental variation. This significant systematic variation, in conjunction with the statistical variation of the background, requires a very conservative threshold in order to yield the same false-positive rate as the stationary detection case. This manuscript discusses a novel detector geometry that induces a unique time-encoded signature (TES) when exposed to point sources. The identification of temporal signatures for point sources using TES has been demonstrated and compared with the canonical method. This work demonstrates that temporal signatures mitigate systematic background variation and thus increase point-source detection in a moving detector system.

The unit has been designed to operate at room temperature under water. The CZT OMEGA system is based on a single 10 x 10 x 10 mm(3) CZT detector associated with a single electronics channel. To improve performance, the system incorporates several technologies including: an electrode design named the "Mixed" electrode which combines a noncontacting Frisch grid and the pixel field effect to obtain maximum sensitivity from the 10 x 10 X 10 mm(3) CZT detector, a single hybrid preamplifier designed to reduce noise, an electronics board configured to enhance count rate capabilities and finally, electron bi-parametric (BP) correction (pulse height corrected via measurement of rise time) to improve both energy resolution and detection efficiency. This paper reports the most recent results obtained with the CZT OMEGA spectrometric system at high energy (Cs-137 and Eu-152 sources) at both low and high count rate: spectrometric performance shows an energy resolution of 1% FWHM at 662 keV (0.8% at 1408 keV) from 1 kcps to 50 kcps, deteriorating to 2% FWHM at 200 kcps.

In order to avoid undesired failure of such components that is due to changes produced in the material optical properties by the hostile conditions, it is useful to perform a preliminary investigation of the radiation induced damage on each material and on different types of optical components. In this work, coated optical components are investigated. A set of optical coatings were submitted to gamma irradiation at the Calliope Co-60 radioisotope source (Research Centre ENEA-Casaccia, Rome) in order to simulate the hostile radiation environment in which they could be employed. The behavior of different substrates, single-layer materials and multilayer optical coatings was investigated by comparing both transmittance and reflectance measurements before and after the gamma-ray exposure.

All are commercially available detectors. The two scintillators were a circle minus 13 mm x 13 mm lanthanum chloride [LaCl3(Ce)] detector and a 025 turn x 25 mm sodium iodide [NaI(Ti)] detector. The two semiconductor detectors were a 10 x 10 x 3 mm(3) cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) detector with a coplanar gridded anode and a 5 x 5 x 5 mm(3) CZT detector with an extended cathode. The efficiency, resolution, and peak shape of these devices are compared. Since LaCl3(Ce) is a relatively new commercial scintillator material, additional information on the performance of this detector is presented. Specifically, the impact of naturally occurring radioactive La-138 and additional contamination from alpha-emitting radionuclides on the background measured with this detector are discussed.

First, optical transparency and emission spectra were investigated. We confirmed that the transparency of the ceramics is comparable to that of the monocrystalline one (similar to 80%) in wavelengths longer than similar to 500 nm. The ceramics did not show an indication of lattice defects which is present in the monocrystalline YAG. Then the response to gamma-rays was studied using a phototube as a scintillation light detector. The 0.5 mol% sample exhibited the highest light yield (similar to 40% of CsI), with an energy resolution of about 7.2% at Cs-137 662 keV photoabsorption peak. The optimum Cc concentration for a similar to 2 mm thick ceramic YAG was determined to be similar to 0.1 mol%. Using the delayed coincidence method, the principal time constant of the ceramic YAGs was measured as similar to 80 ns. By irradiating 5.49 MeV alpha-particles, the alpha-ray to gamma-ray light yield ratio of the ceramic YAGs was found to depend negatively on the amount of Cc; namely, 0.28, 0.20, and 0.13 in the increasing order of the Ce concentration. The 200-1000 keV intrinsic background of the 0.5 mol% ceramic was similar to 10(-5) counts/s/cm(3), indicating that it is not significantly contaminated by radioactive impurities.

J	Pausch, G; Stein, J; Teofilov, N				Pausch, G; Stein, J; Teofilov, N			Stabilizing scintillation detector systems by exploiting the temperature dependence of the light pulse decay time	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						detectors; digital signal processors; gamma-ray spectroscopy; pulse analysis; scintillation detectors; signal processing; stability; temperature		Scintillation detectors must tolerate a wide range of ambient temperatures and strong temperature slopes when used in outdoor applications. Such demanding conditions are typical for all homeland security applications. An effective and efficient detector stabilization compensating for temperature dependent gain shifts is essential to maintain energy calibration and resolution. Reliable, well-established solutions are based on radioactive reference sources; however, alternatives are much asked for. The gain shift correction for the temperature dependence of the scintillation light output requires elaborate hardware and software means without a reference source. Strong and rapid temperature changes further complicate the situation as there is no thermal equilibrium in the detector but rather a temperature field. This paper presents a new technique of gain stabilization which considers the effective scintillator temperature by analyzing the average pulse shape of detector signals. The pulse shape is correlated with the scintillation light decay time. This parameter can be extracted online from digitized detector signals. The decay time data are used to eliminate all the temperature determined system gain shifts without radioactive reference source. This technique has been verified in extensive climate chamber measurements. The results are discussed.

Radiation detectors were fabricated in p-CdTe/n-CdTe/n(+) -GaAs structure, where a 2-5 mu m thick iodine-doped n-CdTe buffer layer was first grown on the n(+)-GaAs substrate, followed by about 100-mu m-thick undoped p-like CdTe layer. The detectors exhibited good rectification property and good charge transport property. They showed reverse bias leakage currents typically from 1 to 5 mu A/cm(2) at 40V bias, and clearly demonstrated energy discrimination capability by resolving the 59.5-keV gamma peak from the Am-241 radioisotope during the radiation detection test. Some results on direct growth of CdTe epilayers on Si substrates are also presented.

To demonstrate the feasibility of vitrification and the durability of the high-level waste glass, a high-level waste sample from Tank AZ-101 was processed to glass, analyzed with respect to chemical composition, radionuclide content, waste loading, and the presence of crystalline phases and then tested for leachability. The glass was analyzed with inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, gamma-energy spectrometry, alpha-spectrometry, and liquid scintillation counting. The WISE Uranium Project calculator was used to calculate the main sources of radioactivity to the year 3115. The observed crystallinity and the results of leachability testing of the glass will be reported in Part 2 of this paper. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Part 2: Phase identification and waste form leachability	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							GLASS CORROSION	A sample of Hanford high-level radioactive waste from Tank AZ-101 was vitrified into borosilicate glass and tested to demonstrate its compliance with regulatory requirements. Compositional aspects of this study were reported in Part 1 of this paper. This second and last part presents results of crystallinity and leachability testing. Crystallinity was quantified in a glass sample heat treated according to the calculated cooling curve of glass at the centerline of a Hanford Waste Treatment Plant canister. By quantitative X-ray diffraction analysis and image analysis applied to scanning electron microscopy micrographs, the sample contained 7 mass% of spinel, a solid solution of franklinite, trevorite, and other minor spinels. Glass leachability was measured with the product consistency test and the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure. Measured data and model estimates were in reasonable agreement. Leachability results were close to those obtained for the non-radioactive simulant. Models were used to elucidate the effects of glass composition of spinel formation and to estimate effects of spinel formation on glass leachability. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the 2001 tests, the cathode current efficiency was between 60 and 100% but the Pu fraction in the MOX was between 5 and 20%. In 2002 tests, the fraction was raised to more than 30% by modifying the test conditions but the current efficiency fell to between 20 and 60%. A new method was proposed to simulate. the parasitic current due to the electrode reactions of UO22+/UO2+, Pu4+/Pu3+ and Fe3+/Fe2+ at the cathode. It was found that the parasitic current due to the UO22+/UO2+ reaction significantly lowers the current efficiency especially when the cathode potential is kept near the equilibrium value during the electrolysis to increase the Pu fraction in the MOX deposit.

This study investigated the behavior of the radioactive elements during a thermal treatment of the nuclear graphite waste, based on the thermodynamic equilibrium. Two typical thermal conditions were simulated: an excess air incineration and a hydrothermal oxidation. Tritium, C-14 and Cl-36 are expected to be present in the gas phase throughout the whole waste thermal systems. Ba-133, Sr-90, Na-22, and (CS)-C-137 were analyzed to be semi-volatile elements. Their behavior will be dependent upon the gaseous atmosphere as well as the operating temperature. Uranium species are expected to convert into a gas-phase UO3 at temperatures above 1,000 degrees C under excess air incineration atmospheres. Other radioactive elements such as Ni-59, Co-60, Ce-141, Eu-152 and Am-241 are non-volatile at temperatures up to 1,200 degrees C, regardless of the gaseous atmosphere being simulated.

The survey sampled 970 sites which covered an area of more than 100 km(2). The average activities of K-40, U-238 and Th-232 were found 655 +/- 338, 85.8 +/- 31.6, and 159.8 +/- 49.0 Bq(.)kg(-1) in soil or cement of pavement in the urban area; 832 +/- 455, 87.3 +/- 41.6, and 179.3 +/- 40.7 Bq(.)kg(-1) in weathered granite; 634 +/- 76.8, 35.2 +/- 14.6 and 70.2 +/- 18.6 Bq(.)kg(-1) in the Quaternary sediments in Doumen District. The average Th-232 activity (159.8 +/- 49.0 Bq(.)kg(-1)) is above the average in both China (49 Bq(.)kg(-1)) and the world (30 Bq(.)kg(-1)). Terrestrial air-absorbed dose rates calculated from the above activities are 85.08 +/- 15.63, 183.33 +/- 40.80 nGy(.)h(-1) respectively over the Quaternary sediments and weathered granite, and 163.49 +/- 30.15 nGy(.)h(-1) in the urban area. The average calculated air-absorbed dose rate is about 12.63% larger than the value measured by a portable plastic scintillator dosemeter. The K-40, U-238 and Th-232 activities in surface medium are mainly originated from biotite granites, as indicated by a strong correlation between the radioactivity level and geological lithology in the surveyed area.

In the present paper the behavior of Cs-137 and Sr-90 in different compartments of the Monterosi Lake (central Italy) was assessed. The (CS)-C-137 concentration was measured in lake water as well as sediment, stream water, aquatic plant and fish samples. 90Sr concentration in water and sediments was also determined. A total inventory of 4206 +/- 76 Bq.m(-2) and 958 79 Bq.m(-2) (on 27/6/01) has been found for (CS)-C-137 and Sr-90, respectively.

A comparable tritium enrichment factor of 1.14 to 1.43 was obtained for all systems, except for CsF, which gave an enrichment factor of 1.93.

J	Hassan, NM				Hassan, NM			Adsorption of cesium from spent nuclear fuel basin water	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								Batch equilibrium and kinetic measurements were performed for Cs+ exchange in silicotitanate zeolite (Ionsiv(R) TIE-96) at 30 and 60 degrees C. The Langmuir isotherm equation provided a good fit of the equilibrium data. The heats of exchange reaction between Cs+ in the aqueous solution and Na+ in the zeolite structure were derived from the equilibrium data. The results indicate that the exchange mechanism is different from that of physical adsorption on heterogeneous materials. The apparent diffusion coefficients and activation energy were derived from the kinetic data and the values obtained for inter-diffusion of Cs+ and Na+ cations in the zeolite structure were 1.33.10(-12) and 1.04.10(-12) cm(2.)s(-1) at 30 and 60 degrees C, respectively. The activation energy for Cs+ was 1.7 kcal/mol, suggesting that the Cs+ cation can access easily all the sites in the zeolite framework. Thus, the exchange of Cs+ with Na+ in the zeolite was not hindered by ion-sieve effects.

In order to extend its utilization to include the k(0)-standardization method, the following neutron spectrum parameters in inner and outer irradiation channels were determined by the "Cd-ratio for multi-monitor method": the thermal-to-epithermal flux ratio, f, and the epithermal flux shape factor, a. Neutron spectrum parameters determined in the inner irradiation channel B2, are: alpha = -0.052 +/- 0.002 and f = 19.2 +/- 0.5. For the outer irradiation channel B4, the neutron spectrum parameters were found to be alpha = +0.029 +/- 0.003 and f = 48.3 +/- 3.3. The results are compared with the neutron spectrum parameters of other reactor facilities with similar core configuration such as the Slowpoke and Miniature Neutron Source Reactor facilities available in the literature.

Synthetic zeolite (zeolite-X) and natural zeolite (clinoptilolite) as an active component were mixed with polyacrylonitrile (PAN) solution as a binder to form the PAN-zeolite-X (composite-X) and PAN-clinoptilolite (composite-C) composite adsorbents. Optimum preparation conditions for the composites were determined. Effects of various parameters on the preparation of the composites were investigated. Each of the prepared composite adsorbents was treated with UO2(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O and Th(NO3)(4)center dot 4H(2)O in aqueous solution to determine their sorption capacities. It was found that both composites have about four times higher thorium than uranium uptake capacity. XRD-diffraction patterns were obtained for zeolite-X, composite-X, clinoptilolite and composite-C. Surface area and cation exchange capacities (CEC) were also determined for both composites.

J	Premadas, A; Saravanakumar, G				Premadas, A; Saravanakumar, G			Fluorimetric determination of uranium in certain refractory minerals, environmental samples and industrial waste materials	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							LASER-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE; LEVEL; ROCKS	A simple sample decomposition and laser fluorimetric determination of uranium at trace level is reported in certain refractory minerals, like ilmenite, rutile, zircon and monazite; environmental samples viz. soil and sediments; industrial waste materials, such as, coal fly ash and red mud. Ilmenite sample is decomposed by heating with ammonium fluoride. Rutile, zircon and monazite minerals are decomposed by fusion using a mixture of potassium bifluoride and sodium fluoride. Environmental and industrial waste materials are brought into solution by treating with a mixture of hydrofluoric and nitric acids. The laser induced fluorimetric determination of uranium is carried out directly in rutile, zircon and in monazite minerals and after separation in other samples. The determination limit was 1 mu g.g(-1) for ilmenite, soil, sediment, coal fly ash and red mud samples, and it is 5 mu g.g(-1) for rutile, zircon and monazite. The method is also developed for the optical fluorimetric determination of uranium (determination limit 10 mu g.g(-1)) in ilmenite, rutile, zircon and monazite minerals. The methods are simple, accurate, and precise and they require small quantity of sample and can be applied for the routine analysis.

The sorption isotherm model is usually used to describe the sorption behaviors and assess the sorption potential of radionuclides on rock. However, most of the studies to investigate the feasibility of isotherm models for the sorption of radionuclides are based on the assumption that the sorption energy is uniform and homogeneously distributed on the sorbent surfaces. In this study, two heterogeneity-based isotherms, Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm model (LF) and generalized-Freundlich isotherm model (GF), were used for the evaluation of the sorption characteristics of cesium on the selected Taiwan tuff and basalt. The sorption experiments in this study were carried out by batch method, and the experimental data were modeled by LF and GF heterogeneity-based isotherm models. The results showed that both of the LF and GF models could fit the data more perfectly than the Langmuir model. The heterogeneity of sorption onto tuff and basalt could be well characterized by the LF and GF models by means of the calculation and plotting of the affinity spectrum. The results showed that the sorption surface of tuff is more heterogeneous and complex than that of basalts.

This labeling reaction was carried out via electrophilic substitution of hydrogen atom with the iodonium atom I+. The reaction was found to be strongly dependent on pH of the reaction medium. At neutral pH value, 7 the labeling yield was maximum. This may be due to the good solubility of indomethacin, good protonation and good working of the oxidizing agent at this pH value. Towards the acidic pH value, the yield decreased and towards the alkaline pH value the yield decreased due to the decomposition of the indomethacin. The labeling reaction is very fast but needs five minutes for completion. The produced I-125-indomethacin was found stable in-vivo as the thyroid gland uptake did not exceed 2%. Labeled indomethacin shows a good localization in inflamed muscle, either septic or sterile. It excretes mainly via liver and to some extent via kidney. The imaging must be carried out at 24-hour post injection, after that time, the background activity has cleared and the activity is concentrated in the target site.

The technique used is the liquid-liquid extraction based on the complexation of Cs+ by these anions to form neutral compounds which are extracted by organic solvents (diluents) of medium polarity. Promising results were obtained with the anion [1-(C6H5CH2)(2)(C6H5)NB10H9](-) (3) soluble in many organic solvents. The most efficient diluent for the extraction is nitrobenzene. Using hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid in the aqueous medium instead of nitric acid does not significantly affect the efficiency of Cs+ extraction.

Physikalisches Institut of the University of Gottingen were reinstalled in a new building during the summer of 2003. They cover a wide energy range and are used for many different applications. The highest energies are obtained with the 3 MV Pelletron MaRPel, which is preferentially used for ion beam analysis. Ions in the energy range from 30 keV to 1000 keV are delivered by the 500 kV heavy ion implanter IONAS which is used for analysis, implantation and ion beam modification. ADONIS and STRINGER are mass-separated ion beam deposition (MSIBD) systems which produce 30 keV mass separated beams which can be decelerated to 20 eV to synthesize isotopically pure hard coatings like cubic BN, tetrahedral bounded amorphous C (ta-C) and B,C. The low energy implanter IOSCHKA delivers ions of 10 keV maximum, which can be slowed down to a few eV. The targets can be transferred in UHV to an STM set-up to investigate surface modifications after single ion impacts or the development of surface ripple patterns. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of the present study is to show how to obtain a suitable beam intensity of a C-11-beam extracted from the HIMAC-synchrotron. Regarding this study, related developments include the production of radioactive isotopes (C-11) by a cyclotron, gas-separation, gas-compression, gas-pulsing and ionization. Further, residue (CO2)-C-11-gas can be reproduced in the ionization process. As the result of a calculation, an order of 10(8) ppp of C-11(6+) ions can be extracted from the HIMAC-synchrotron during 18 min at 3.3 s intervals with a 1 ms beam pulse under the assumption of 1 Ci of C-11-production. Details of the study are presented. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To overcome this problem, a hybrid technique was used, consisting of depositing a thin chromium film on steel surface and then bombarding it with nitrogen ions. By a complex recoil process, chromium atoms are implanted into the steel matrix. Plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) was used in this bombardment. The new Cr-rich layer allows the formation of Cr oxides and nitrides. Treated surfaces were characterized by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and conversion electron Mossbauer spectroscopy (CEMS), showing formation of a new Cr-rich layer. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

They address three major issues: (i) the simulation by ion irradiation of the stability of a matrix submitted to radiative environment; (ii) the doping of a material with stable or radioactive elements which simulate the species to be confined; (iii) the characterisation of a material via nuclear microanalysis techniques. Among various classes of nuclear matrices the spent nuclear fuel is widely considered as a potential candidate for the stabilisation of radioactive wastes in scenarios of long term interim storage or final geological disposal. Illustrative examples revealing the potentialities of the use of ion beams either as a pure characterisation tool - to investigate the chemical stability of the UO2 matrix under an oxygen potential - or in a combined way (e.g. irradiation/characterisation, doping/characterisation) - to explore the radiation stability and the behaviour of foreign species - are presented. Transformations (stoichiometry, depth and structure of growing hyperstoichiometric U4O9/U3O7 oxides) occurring during low-temperature air oxidation of uranium dioxide single crystals are reported. Swift heavy ion irradiation of UO2 single crystals leads to a peculiar single crystal-polycrystal transformation (i.e. polygonisation of the fluorite-type structure of the material). Irradiation of UO2 at low energy shows that the damage production is directly linked to the energy deposited in nuclear elastic collisions. The lattice location of helium atoms (generated in large amount during the storage period) in interstitial octahedral positions is discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The transmission mode detection procedures, localization of the region scanned and normalization of the helium lateral distributions are now well established. For sintered UO2, pellets implanted at a dose of 2 x 10(16) He-3/cm(2), the results show that the lateral helium distribution is correlated to the sample microstructure after annealing for 1 h at 1300 degrees C. The enhanced desorption of helium in the vicinity of grain boundaries points to them playing an essential part in helium diffusion in UO2. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Analytical scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ion beam analysis (IBA) techniques, isotopic tracing and secondary ion mass-depth profiling (SIMS) have been used to investigate the variations of the surface composition of glass. In acidic medium, the glass surface is generally covered by a thick hydrated silica layer, mobile elements like Li, Na and B and transition elements (Fe, Zr, Mo, etc.) are strongly depleted. Near pH 7, relative enrichments of aluminium, iron and rare earths are shown together with strong Li, Na and B depletions. In basic medium, the glass surface exhibits relative enrichments of the major part of transition metals (from Cr to U) whereas mobile elements seem to be kept close to their nominal concentration level at the glass surface and Si is severely impoverished. Hydrogen incorporated at the glass surface after leaching is much more immobile in neutral and basic media than in acid medium. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to study that diffusion, DC-magnetron sandwich layers of natural I'd and Rh were produced, annealed, and the I'd profiles were measured by ToF-SIMS. Nevertheless, because ToF-SIMS depth profiles suffer from a lack of quantification and depth calibration, the study was completed by RBS, PIXE. The combination of these techniques allowed us to convert the ToF-SIMS depth profiles from an intensity-time to a concentration-depth profile and thus to study the I'd diffusion in Rh.

A new generation of AMS has been developed during the last years. Here it will be shown that even the heaviest elements and isotopes can be measured with such compact AMS systems. We demonstrate that the routine measurement of Pu isotopes in environmental samples at a level of a few femto-grams is possible. Even the measurement of U-236/U-238 seems feasible at levels present in natural uranium ore. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The zircon samples analysed are of the gem variety with very attractive colour mix. As-received crystals were qualitatively analysed in the bulk/solid form while quantitative analysis was carried out using pellets made from pulverised and properly homogenised samples. In addition to zirconium which is the major element with concentrations in the range of 24-26 wt.%, our quantitative analysis showed the presence in minor and trace quantities of 21 other elements/impurities including K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Se, V, Cr, Co, Ni and Rb. In contrast, a number of other elements such as Th and U were observed only in as-received bulk/solid samples, which probably indicates that they are present as inclusions. Scanning electron microscope equipped with EDS analysis confirmed that the major elements present in the samples are zirconium, titanium and oxygen leading to 99.25% ZrSiO4. The obvious distinction in coloration of the zircon crystals is attributed to the difference in concentrations of some of the impurities the material contained. It is conjectured here also that the internal radioactivity of Nigerian zircon could be due to the presence of U and Th impurities. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Among these data, those concerning alpha-particle interactions on light nuclei are not well known, although crucial for neutron emission problems via (alpha, n) processes in nuclear fuels (oxide, carbide, nitride). Examples of applications are reprocessing, packaging and storage of radioactive waste, and intrinsic neutron source term evaluation in critical and subcritical reactors (accelerator-driven systems). The goal is the modeling of (alpha, n) reactions on oxygen isotopes to extract the resonance parameters. The SAMMY code, which relies on the Reich-Moore approximation of the R-matrix theory, is used. In the most recent version, the SAMMY code allows the study of the in- and outgoing charged-particle channels. An important validation of this new feature has been made. In addition, a manifest lack of experimental data for this type of reaction has been underlined. Finally, the impact of the new pointwise description of the (alpha, n) reaction cross section on the energy distribution calculation of the intrinsic neutron source of an irradiated mixed-oxide fuel pin is shown and compared to the standard calculation, which uses average cross sections.

The relaxation times of the heat treated E-1' center in natural unirradiated quartz of a granite and of uranium ore were 3.5-7.1 mu s. Electron and gamma ray irradiated quartz showed the relaxation times of 7.1-15.7 mu s while He ion implanted quartz showed 1.0-2.0 mu s, much less than the other samples. The intensity of the E-1(') center increased in stepwise beating up to 300 degrees C before decreasing above that temperature except for He implanted sample which showed monotonic decrease on heating. The present experimental results showed that the characteristics of the E-1', center created by high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation is different from that by low LET radiation, suggesting that, in nature, the oxygen vacancies are created by low LET radiation, i.e. external beta and gamma rays, rather than by alpha particles and alpha recoil nuclei.

ICRP 23 (2) (1993)). The annual effective dose varies from 1.63 to 3.45 mSv y(-1) with the geometric mean value of 2.57 mSv y(-1). The seasonal variations of indoor radon reveal the maximum values in winter and minimum in summer. The radium content, radon exhalation rate and the concentration of soil radon are measured using the Can Technique. The fission track etch technique is used for the estimation of uranium in soil. The uranium and radium concentration in soil varies from 0.54 to 3.68 mg kg(-1) and 5.70 to 25.45 Bq kg(-1), respectively. The radon exhalation rate in these samples varies from 246.63 to 1100.00 mBq m(-2) h(-1) (7.17 to 31.98 mBq kg(-1) h(-1)). A positive correlation has been observed between uranium concentration and radon exhalation rate in soil. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
