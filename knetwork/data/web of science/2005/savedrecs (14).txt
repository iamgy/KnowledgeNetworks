This method of synergetic effect of radiogenic helium-3 and hydrogen is a radiation-safe technique to study the tritium impact on mechanical properties of structural materials. Applicability of the method is illustrated by technique and research results on the impact of high-pressure hydrogen (80MPa), helium-3 (concentration similar to 140appm) and their synergetic (hydrogen+He-3) effecs on mechanical properties of CrNi40MoCuTiAl alloy in temperature range from 20 to 600 degrees C It has been shown that joint effect of radiogenic helium-3 and hydrogen on mechanical properties of alloy can not be represented as the result of a simple summation of helium and hydrogen embrittlement. Proposed technique of synergetic impact of radiogenic helium-3 and hydrogen allows more correct simulation and investigation in the tritium impact on mechanical properties of materials than individual research in helium or hydrogen embrittlement.

Experiments have been run with both protium and deuterium obtaining their respective transport parameters of diffusivity (D), Sieverts' constant (K-s), the trap site density (N-t) and the trapping activation energy (E-t). Isotope effects on these transport parameters are analysed and modelled. Because the classical isotope relation for diffusivity has not been fulfilled, quantum-statistical vibration theory has been applied to model the isotopic relation. The hydrogen vibration properties description in a metallic-host lattice allows deriving more accurate tritium transport parameters. A congruent isotopic variation of diffusion parameters related to the type of crystal structure, bcc, has been confirmed.

The assembly was designed for tests using powerful ion sources, which has a capability to simulate condition relevant to that of the ITER divertor. The heat load test of the prototype module has been performed using an electron beam to verify thermal and mechanical behavior of the bonded structure and to assess its structural integrity under the cyclic heat loads. Then, the first tests using tritium ion beam generated by the TPE apparatus at TSTA/LANL with the prototype module was performed and procedure to measure tritium permeated was established. Considerations for tests using the target module with defects generated by neutron irradiation or accelerated ion beam irradiation will be also taken in the new module design.

In this process, tritium (3x10(11) Bq/h) is generated in the lithium flow. Tritium permeation and inventory of IFMIF lithium loop components are evaluated for safety of the IFMIF and the design of tritium processing system of the IFMIF The tritium permeation rate from a V-Ti hot trap is about 95% of the total amount, 1.0 X 10(6) Bq/h, from lithium loop. Therefore, the reduction of the tritium permeation rate from only the V-Ti hot trap can directly reduce the total tritium permeation from the Li loop and the gaseous tritium in the Li loop area. Total tritium contained in the walls ewt by liquid lithium in the IFMIF is 5.3x10(7) Bq, which is much smaller than 4.9x10(14) Bq of tritium contained in the Li flow with a volume of 9 m(3).

J	Iseli, M				Iseli, M			Sensitivity analysis of tritium permeation into the FW-coolant in ITER	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 12-17, 2004	Baden Baden, GERMANY				FACING MATERIAL BERYLLIUM; HYDROGEN; RETENTION	Knowledge of the levels of tritium in the First Wall (FW) coolant and components of ITER is important for public and operator safety and waste management. To overcome the large uncertainty of plasma wall interaction and physical properties, a basic set of properties is theoretically calculated for the dissolved tritium atoms in a perfect Beryllium (Be) lattice. These properties are combined with models for tritium trapping by lattice imperfections including the equilibrium conditions between gaseous, dissolved and trapped hydrogen isotopes. The 3 models for trapping by impurities, radiation damage and surface defects are adjusted to experimental solubilities, to tritium release experiments from irradiated samples and to outgassing of hydrogen isotopes from the JET FW. An elastic lattice model evaluates the activation energy of diffusion. For the calculations, the code DIET (Diffusion, Implantation and Equilibrium Trapping) was developed, which includes tritium trapping with time-dependent trap concentrations of multiple trap sites. The sensitivity analysis, with the expected deviations from the basic properties provides confidence that tritium permeation is below one gram in ITER for a neutron load of 0.3MWa/m(2) within 10 years.

It was found that the annihilation of radiation defects consisted of two processes, the fast and the slow processes. The activation energies of them were determined to be 0.14 +/- 0.01 e V and 0.58 +/- 0.01 e V, respectively. The F+-center was found to act as a trapping site of tritium by comparing its annihilation behavior with that of tritium release. Taking the results obtained in the present and the previous works in consideration, it can be said that the annihilation process of oxygen vacancies is of very important because tritium release from the bulk of a breeder starts just after the slow annealing process becomes dominant. Therefore, to understand the slow annihilation process of radiation defects is an important key to clarify the mechanism of tritium release from ceramic breeder materials.

In this study the mass transfer resistance between grain surface and surface water is newly introduced because it is preferable to use the same reaction rate as that reported previously. The estimated values using the new model give good agreement with the observed tritium release curves and also with the release curves estimated using the model so far.

The methods are mainly intended for design-oriented blanket experiments and are based on the activation of thin diagnostic pellets. In the direct method, the tritium activity bred from Li isotopes can be evaluated separately using two activated Li-containing pellets, measured by liquid scintillation counting. The method allows precise measurements of tritium activity in the pellet at a level of 2 Bq/g. The indirect method is based on the use of model activation reaction Cl-35(n, alpha)P-32 and P-31(n, gamma)P-32, that possess a similar neutron spectrum sensitivity as direct tritium production reactions on Li-7 and Li-6, respectively, and an effective measurement of the activation product of model reactions, P-32, by Cherenkov radiation counting. The reaction rate of model reactions can be calibrated in order to obtain the TPR.

In that case, tritium leakage by permeation to coolant can not be ignored. So, the application of H2O-added sweep gas is discussed, with which tritium leakage to coolant can be much reduced. As the result of discussion, H2O-added sweep gas is probable method of tritium recovery. For the further detailed discussion, it is important to enrich the data correlated to the interaction of H-2, H2O, breeder, multiplier and structures.

The blanket is the place where the tritium recovery system has contact with the cooling system for electricity generation at the elevated temperature. Therefore, design of efficient means to recover bred tritium with minimum permeation loss is to be made. It is proposed in this study to construct a recovery system using the Pd alloy with adsorption bed after a precious metal catalyst bed. Effects of existence of water on dissociation reaction of hydrogen on palladium alloy membrane and on recombination reaction are discussed in this study for the case when 800 Pa of water vapor is introduced to the permeation primary side and/or permeation secondary side for the case when water vapor co-existed, and it was observed that water vapor prevents hydrogen permeation through palladium alloy at the lower temperature than 473 K.

A CMSB in a semi-technical scale (one-sixth of the flow rate of the ITER-HCPB) was design and constructed at the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe. The full capacity of CMSB filled with 20 kg of MS-5A was calculated based on adsorption isotherm data to be 9.4 mol of H-2 at partial pressure 120 Pa. The breakthrough tests at flow rates up to 2 Nm(3) h(-1) of He with 110 Pa of H-2 conformed with good agreement the adsorption capacity of the CMSB. The mass-transfer zone was found to be relatively narrow (12.5 % of the MS Bed height) allowing to scale up the CMSB to ITER flow rates.

For safety management of tritiated water storage, it is essential to be able to predict pressure increase resulting from this phenomenon. The present study aims to identify the mechanisms that take place in self-radiolysis of chemically pure liquid tritiated water. The evolution of the concentration of hydrogen and oxygen in the gas phase of closed vessels containing tritiated water has been followed experimentally. Simulation of pure water radiolysis has been carried out using data from the literature. In order to fit experimental results, simulation should take into account gas phase recombination reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. A simplified system has been extracted from the complete chemical system used to simulate radiolysis. This system allows identifying the basic mechanisms that are responsible for tritiated water self-radiolysis.

It is based on the evaporation model and uses the droplet model of Myers and Swiatecki to express the Q((n,t)). The behavior of the different terms of the droplet model involved in Q((n,t)) was checked individually before choosing the pertinent terms and setting up the formula. This relation leads to the lowest value of chi(2) compared with the existing formulae, when used to correlate the experimental sigma((n,t)) data for 25 nuclei.

After mixing them at room temperature, T-2 and CO2 decreased rapidly in the first 30 minutes and then the reactions between them became much slower.

We have determined the inflammation temperature of HOGM containing the following impurities: Ar, Xe, H2O and tritium within the range of initial gas pressure from 3 to 13 kPa. The results agree well with the available reference and numerical simulation results. The inflammation temperatures of HOGM in the range of initial gas pressure from 2 to 13 kPa increases from 793 to 873 K. Average inflammation temperatures of hydrogen and deuterium mixtures differ no more than 1.6 %. Introduction of inert gases (argon and xenon) into gaseous mixture up to 45 volume percent does not change inflammation temperature significantly. Water introduction (in the range from 2.4 to 25 volume percent) does not cause gaseous mixture inflammation. The effect of tritium beta-radiation on temperature of GM inflammation within the range of tritium concentration concerned is insignificant and agrees with the results of numerical modeling obtained earlier.

In this unique device, tritium passivates defects and at the same time is an internal source of beta particles. The beta particles traverse the i-layer and through impact ionization, electron-hole pairs are generated These charges are separated by the built-in field of the p-i-n junction and electrical power is generated The power from the devices is about 0.2 nW cm(-2) in a device of 400 nm thickness. The decay of tritium leads to the formation of dangling bonds and strain related defects in the silicon lattice. These defects lead to a decrease in the effective width of the space charge region and thereby to an increase in the recombination rate of carriers. As a consequence the electric power decreases with time. To overcome this degradation in performance, delta layered devices were made by selectively introducing tritium into the intrinsic region by modulating the tritium gas fraction during film deposition. The electric power from devices with a delta layer have better stability.

The autoradiographs show that hydrogen accumulation characteristics around the inclusions depend on types of the inclusions. In the case of MnS, hydrogen was inhomogeneously distributed in the ferrite matrix surrounding the MnS inclusion, probably because hydrogen is trapped in defects formed around MnS. The inhomogeneous distribution of hydrogen may be originated from the asymmetric stress field produced by a contraction of the MnS phase in the heat treatment, i.e. the inhomogeneous volumetric change of MnS owing to its larger thermal expansion than that of the ferrite phase. In the case of Al2O3, hydrogen was intensely localized at boundary layers of the ferrite matrix surrounding the Al2O3 inclusion. This could be attributed to hydrogen trapping at defects introduced by a residual stress in the boundary layers of the ferrite matrix due to larger contraction of the ferrite phase than that of the Al2O3 phase on cooling. Similarly hydrogen was accumulated in the surrounding ferrite matrix but more widely distributed around Cr carbide probably because difference in the thermal expansion between the Cr carbide and ferrite phases is. less than that between the Al2O3 and ferrite phases.

Indeed hydrogen is introduced during the growth of amorphous silicon films, used in active matrix displays and solar cells, to passivate silicon dangling bonds and to relax the lattice thereby reducing the density of states in the energy gap by several orders of magnitude and giving rise to device grade material. Ideally, hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) is a continuous covalently bonded random network of silicon-silicon and silicon-hydrogen atoms, with the predominant nearest neighbour environment similar to that of crystalline silicon. a-Si:H typically contains about 10 atomic percent hydrogen. Tritium can readily substitute for hydrogen in a-Si:H without altering the physicochemical properties of the material. Tritium decay leads to a change in the local bond structure of the material as helium detaches from bonds leaving behind dangling bonds. The decay rate of tritium and therefore the rate of dangling bond formation is determined by the half-life of tritium. Hence, tritium provides a unique avenue to dynamically study the effect of dangling bonds on the density of states in the energy gap and therefore on the optoelectronic properties of a-Si:H Tritiated hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H-T) was deposited using mixtures of tritium and silane gases in a dc saddle-field glow-discharge deposition system. The amount of tritium in the films was controlled by adjusting the relative flow of tritium and silane gases into the deposition chamber. Photoluminescence, isothermal capacitive transient spectroscopy and constant photocurrent spectroscopy were used to measure defect concentration as a function of time in the films. The defect concentration was found to increase between I and 2 orders of magnitude, in about 300 hours. Thermal annealing decreased the defect concentration. It was found that tritium permits a study of the change in the density of defect states due to dangling bond formation in a-Si:H without the uncertainties introduced by the use of multiple samples.

J	Weinheimer, C				Weinheimer, C			Measuring neutrino properties with tritium	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 12-17, 2004	Baden Baden, GERMANY				ANTINEUTRINO REST MASS; KEV ELECTRONS; BETA-DECAY; FILMS; SEARCH	The discovery of neutrino oscillation proved recently that neutrinos have non-vanishing masses in contrast to their present description within the Standard Model of particle physics. However, the neutrino mass scale, which is very important for particle physics as well as for cosmology and astrophysics, cannot be resolved by oscillation experiments. The beta-decaying isotope tritium is a key isotope to search for new physics in the neutrino sector: For more than 50 years tritium has been the best isotope to search for a non-zero value of the mass of the neutrino. The recent experiments at Mainz and Troitsk have given upper limits of about 2 eV/c(2). The new Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino Experiment (KATRIN) will enhance the sensitivity on the neutrino mass by another order of magnitude down to 0.2 eV/c(2). KATRIN will use a windowless gaseous tritium source, in which the tritium inventory is re-circulated and purified yielding a column density of 5 10(17) molecules/cm(2). Another way to search for new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics is to use tritium as a very strong source of low energy electron antineutrinos. The elastic cross section of low energy neutrinos on electrons allows the experiment to become sensitive to a possible magnetic moment of the neutrino.

J	Kazachenko, O				Kazachenko, O		KATRIN Collaboration	Windowless gaseous tritium source of beta electrons for KATRIN (Overview and present status)	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 12-17, 2004	Baden Baden, GERMANY				DECAY; MASS; T-2	The objective of the KArlsruhe TRItium Neutrino experiment (KATRIN) is a direct measurement of the absolute mass of the electron (anti)neutrino by means of a precise study of the endpoint region of the tritium beta spectrum. The expected sensitivity of KATRIN to the neutrino mass is 0.2 eV (90% CL). The experimental setup consists of four main parts: a source of electrons from tritium beta decay, a pre-spectrometer, a unique electron spectrometer with very high energy resolution and a multi pixel detector for low energy beta particles. A "Windowless Gaseous Tritium Source" (WGTS) with differential pumping of tritium is foreseen as the main source in KATRIN. This kind of source represents a gas dynamic system with the source tube 90 mm in diameter and 10 m in length placed in a strong magnetic field and differential pumping stages at both ends of this tube. Tritium gas will be injected in the centre of the source tube producing a gas flow directed to the ends. After pumping down by the differential pumps, compressing up to several hundreds millibars by the transfer pump and purification on the palladium membrane filter, tritium will be injected back to the source tube. The estimated flow rate of the circulated tritium is 1.8 standard cubic centimeters per second (sccs), which corresponds to 2.4 X 10(-4) g/s (40 g/day). The stability of gas density and isotope composition in the source tube should be provided on the level of 0.1% This paper will describe the design concept of the WGTS and will discuss the tritium processing techniques associated with the KATRIN experiment.

As a result in the WGTS tritium gas volume acts as a low-temperature and slightly ionized gas steady state close to quasi neutrality (the Debye length is small in comparison with the setup characteristical sizes). On the basis of an one-dimensional self-consistent model the WGTS plasma steady state is described and the influence of plasma phenomena on neutrino mass measuring process is discussed It is found that electric potentials in a main plasma volume can not significantly make worse the measurement process. At the same time the non-equilibrium electron spectrum and fast plasma flow at the end of the tube can result in instabilities which are able to spoil slightly the beta-electron spectrum endpoint. This problem must be carefully investigated further. For more reliable conclusions more detailed consideration is required that will include kinetic effects in the WGTS plasma.

FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 12-17, 2004	Baden Baden, GERMANY				ORGANICALLY BOUND TRITIUM; WATER	Focusing on environmental tritium levels, measurements have been made for several natural water and leaf samples from an area where no tritium industrial discharge was known to occur. Therefore, to obtain sufficiently accurate data tritium was determined from large samples. Moreover, tritium measurement at environmental level requires appropriate methodology to avoid any contamination. Both tissue free water tritium (TFWT) and organically bound tritium (OBT) were determined for biological samples and compared to preliminary or literature data. In this paper, the authors describe both: - a mobile extraction water device allowing therefore to realise the extraction step under the sampling site conditions to get rid of any contamination. - a sensitive method for low level non-exchangeable OBT determination by a combination of a suitable sample treatment, a large capacity combustion apparatus and low background liquid scintillation spectrometry. Then, owing to validate this approach the authors give an application of this methodology to the determination of both fractions determined on tree leaves originating from the lower Rhone valley. The results demonstrate both the suitability of the procedure as tritium concentration in leaves and natural waters exhibit environmental level concentration and also that the OBT background in the studied area is very close to the one measured in the south west of France.

In the case of tritiated water, the initial OBT content was high in the cold PCA soluble fraction, which contains low molecular weight components, but as the time proceed the OBT was distributed to other fractions, which contains relatively high molecular weight components. Significant time variation in the OBT content was observed in the hot PCA soluble fraction containing nucleic acids, in which the OBT content, expressed as percentage of OBT content in all fractions, changed from 1% at 12 hours to 15% at 50 days. In the cases of tritiated organic compounds, the subcellular distribution of OBT was widely changed owing to their biochemical and metabolic characteristics. Thus, the OBT distribution among subcellular fractions was changed depending on the chemical form at ingestion and on the time after ingestion. The OBT distribution among four subcellular fractions after 22 day' continuous ingestion was also dependent on the chemical form of ingested tritium. Present results should be taken into account for internal dose estimation of tritium in different chemical forms.

Among the isolated strains with high HT oxidation activity, several strains were selected to develop a tritium elimination (detritiation) system. Bioreactors were made of bacterial cells grown on agar medium on a cartridge filter and stored in a refrigerator until use. The detritiation ability of these bioreactors at room temperature was investigated during the intentional HT release experiments carried out in the Cassion Assembly for Tritium Safety Study (CATS) in TPL/JAERI. When HT contaminated air from the CATS was introduced into the biological detritiation system, in which three bioreactors were connected in series, 86% of HT in air was removed as tritiated water in these bioreactors at a flow rate of 100 cm(3)/min for 2 hours.

Interlaboratory comparisons provide one way for laboratories to practice and check their analytical methods and procedures. At AECL's Chalk River Laboratories, two organic matrices with tritium concentrations less than 1.5 kBq/g were developed and distributed to seven laboratories in Canada, Europe and Russia for measurement. Some participants experienced difficulties in analysing the samples, especially with the lower concentrations, where results varied by more than an order of magnitude. Laboratories incorporating procedures such as rinsing to remove tritium from exchangeable sites, using standardized combustion methods and purifying the combustion water obtained more reliable, consistent results. The preparation of the standard reference material must be carefully executed in order to produce a homogeneous sample of uniform size. The tritium measurement community would benefit if standard reference materials in the environmental concentration range were available.

The plants were grown outside before and after the exposure experiments and were exposed to deuterated water vapor in a laboratory in a small chamber equipped with controllers of temperature, humidity and light intensity. Deuterium concentrations in free water and organic matter in rice leaves, stems and grains were investigated up to the harvest time. The deuterium in free water in the grains remained for a longer time after the end of exposure than in the leaves and stems. The mass of OBD in grain at harvest showed the highest value when the exposure was carried out in the early stage of the ripening period When the exposure was carried out after 26 days from the heading, the increase of OBD in the grain was small.

Rate constants of D2O uptake in leaves of tangerine were 0.2 - 1.11 hr(-1) in the daytime release and 0.03-0.12 hr(-1) in the nighttime release. Rate constants of D2O loss in leaf after daytime release were almost the same as those after the nighttime release. No significant differences in the half time of D2O loss were observed between daytime and nighttime releases, but those in winter experiments were about 6 times higher than those in summer ones. The retention of OBD of the edible part of tangerine at harvest was very low and OBD was 0.08% or 0.07% on average of D2O in air moisture in daytime or nighttime releases.

The radionuclide uptake model BURN (developed by NRG, modified), considers not only tritium as tritiated water (HTO) but also the conversion into organically bound tritium (OBT). Comparison with the original BURN mode showed that the modified model gave more realistic results in terms of concentration levels, and consequently for dose assessment as result of ingestion of fishery products. For more accurate modelling, seasonal effects and half-life estimates asa function of body weight and water temperature must be taken into account. A first attempt is given, although limited empirical data gives reason to further investigation of this significant effect.

The structural details are not known, however, due to the functional groups present in these compounds the formation of hydrogen bonds is easily attained. Several humic substances were investigated for their potential use as compounds, which are applicable for tritium enrichment from aqueous solution. For comparison a simple compound, malonic acid, representing only few functional groups was investigated. The experiments were performed using a cryosublimation apparatus, which was run well below equilibrium vapor pressure to avoid any isotope fractionation of HTO and H2O. A higher enrichment factor was found for natural humic acid compared to fulvic acid, however, no enrichment could be found for a synthetic humic acid and malonic acid. Interpretation of the results is difficult since no detailed information on the chemical structure Of humic substances is known.

Tests of DNA dissolved in tritiated water and of maize or barley hydroponically grown in tritiated water confirm the increase. The primary hydration shell of DNA shows an accumulation factor of similar to 1.4, and the exchangeable hydrogens inside DNA show similar to 2. Logistic growth analyses of maize and barley reveal the intrinsic growth rates of tritium 1.3 and 1.2 times larger than that of hydrogen. The higher rate of tritium than hydrogen incorporation in solid biomatter is caused by the hydration shells, which constitute an intrinsic component of biomolecules.

As part of the assessment, a model was developed to simulate the distribution of tritium between sewage sludge and effluent in the sewage treatment plant, the release of tritium upon sludge decomposition and subsequent uptake by plants and animals. The modeling assumptions, as well as key parameters and parameter values will be discussed in this paper.

Radiation effectiveness factors are expressed as subjective probability distributions to represent uncertainty that arises from uncertainties in estimates of relative biological effectiveness obtained from radiobiological studies of stochastic endpoints, limited data on biological effectiveness obtained from human epidemiological studies, and other judgments involved in evaluating the applicability of available information to induction of cancers in humans. Primarily on the basis of reviews and evaluations of available data by experts, probability distributions of radiation effectiveness factors are developed for the following radiation types: neutrons of energy less than 10 keV, 10-100 keV, 0.1-2 MeV (including fission neutrons), 2-20 MeV, and greater than 20 MeV; alpha particles of any energy emitted by radionuclides; photons of energy 30-250 keV and less than 30 keV; and electrons of energy less than 15 keV. Photons of energy greater than 250 keV and electrons of energy greater than 15 keV are assumed to have the same biological effectiveness as reference Co-60 gamma rays and are assigned a radiation effectiveness factor of unity, without uncertainty. For neutrons and alpha particles, separate probability distributions of radiation effectiveness factors are developed for solid tumors and leukemias, and small corrections to represent an inverse dose-rate effect are applied to those distributions in cases of chronic exposure. A radiation effectiveness factor different from unity for 15-60 keV electrons is discussed but is not adopted due to a lack of relevant radiobiological data.

The methodology includes errors generated by both detection methods and modeling methods. To accomplish the task, the method includes classical statistics, Monte Carlo, perturbation, and reliability groupings. Uncertainties are reported in percent of reported dose as a function of total body burden. The cohort was initially sorted into six reliability groups, with "A" being the data set that the investigators are most confident is correct and "G" being the data set with the most ambiguous data. Categories were adjusted based on preliminary calculation of uncertainties using the sorting criteria. Specifically, the impact of transportability (the parameter used to describe the transport of plutonium from the lung to systemic organs) was underestimated, and the structure of the sort was reorganized to reflect the impact of transportability. The finalized categories are designated with Roman numerals I through V, with "I" being the most reliable. Excluding Category V (neither bioassay nor autopsy), the highest uncertainty in lung doses is for individuals from Category IV-which ranged from 90 -375 % for total body burdens greater than 10 Bq, along with work histories that indicated exposure to more than one transportability class. The smallest estimated uncertainties for lung doses were determined by autopsy. Category I has a 32-38% uncertainty in the lung dose for total body burdens greater than 1 Bq. First, these results provide a further definition and characterization of the cohort and, second, they provide uncertainty estimates for these plutonium exposure categories.

J	Emery, RJ; Valizadeh, F; Kennedy, V; Shelton, AJ				Emery, RJ; Valizadeh, F; Kennedy, V; Shelton, AJ			An analysis of variables influencing the number of radiation overexposure events in Texas from 1970 to 2000	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topics; emergencies; radiological; exposure; occupational; radiation protection		Sources of radiation are used in a variety of modern work settings, including industrial, medical, research, and agricultural applications. Although regulatory controls exist to limit radiation exposures in these different settings, instances of radiation doses in excess of acceptable limits (referred to as overexposures) do occur. A unique study examined overexposure events in Texas over a 45-y period from 1956 to 2001. The primary purpose of the study was to characterize the factors associated with overexposure events. As part of this characterization, an interesting trend in the number of overexposures by year was observed, but not completely explained. The data revealed a dramatic increase in the number of overexposure events, followed by three apparent phases of decline. These declines are of particular interest because, while the increase and subsequent decrease in overexposures occurred, the number of permits to possess radiation sources in Texas generally increased over the same time period. This study focused on the identification of the factors that led to the trends in overexposure events. Data describing the reported overexposure events in Texas from 1970 to 2000 were obtained from the Texas Department of Health Bureau of Radiation Control (TDH BRC) and entered into a computerized database. With the assistance of senior members of the TDH BRC, the three primary factors influencing the number of overexposures were identified. These included domestic oil and gas exploration and production from 1970 to 2000, wherein sources of radiation are employed in various operations; the establishment of a training and certification requirement for industrial radiographers during the period of 1986 to 1988; and modification of the applicable regulations between 1992 and 1994. The generally accepted indicator of oil and gas exploration and production activity, known as "rig count," is the measure of the number of active oil and gas exploration and production platforms at any given time. Rig count is a parameter of particular interest in Texas because the state's economy is significantly tied to the market value of this important natural resource. The rig count parameter was shown to have a strong correlation with overexposure events (Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.82, p < 0.0001). Interestingly, the sources causing the overexposures indicate that the events stem primarily not from the oil and gas exploration activity itself, but rather from support activities in the form of industrial radiographic procedures. The number of overexposure events was also determined to be influenced by the imposition of the training requirement for radiographers and the modification of the applicable regulations (e.g., the elimination of the quarterly dose limit). The relative magnitude of these influences, however, was far overshadowed by the identified predominant predictor of rig count. The determination of rig count as the significant influencing factor in overexposure events is useful in possibly recognizing the potential for future occurrences of the same nature. This assessment also serves to highlight an apparent significant public health success story, as the number of overexposures per radioactive material licensee is shown to have declined significantly over the 30-y period of study. The factors contributing to this phenomenon are described to serve as a model for use in other settings.

In this experiment, male Wistar rats, 8 wk old, were injected intramuscularly with uranyl nitrate in the femoral muscles. Experiment I: Rats died from 3 to 7 d after they were injected with five doses of 7.9, 15.8, 31.5, 63, and 126 mg kg(-1) uranium. The uranium retained 8.4-13.6% of the injected doses in the kidneys, showing the relationship between the injected dose and the retained concentration (r = 0.997). The excretion rates of the injected doses in the 63 and 126 mg kg(-1) uranium-injected rats were 1.73 % and 3.09 % in urine and 0.81 % and 1.06 % in feces on the first day, and 0.54% and 0.56% in feces on the second day, respectively. Experiment H. The retention of uranium at 1, 3, 6, and 24 h was examined after rats were injected with 63 mg kg(-1) uranium. The concentration of uranium decreased in the plasma, while it increased in the kidneys and femur until 6 h, and it continued to increase in the liver until 24 h. Experiment III. Rats were divided into four groups (n = 10) and were injected with a dose of 2 mg kg(-1) uranium. Two of the groups were then injected intraperitoneally with 240 or 480 mg kg(-1) CBMIDA, and one group was injected with 10 mg kg(-1) EHBP once daily for 28 d, beginning 1 h after uranium injection on the first day. The fourth group was the non-treated control group. The survival rates at the end of the experiment were 80% and 40% in the 240 and 480 mg kg(-1) CBMIDA groups, 50% in the EHBP group, and 20% in the non-treated group. The successive administration of chelating agents was effective in decreasing the concentration of uranium in the kidneys, bone, and liver. The results indicated that uranium induces acute death and renal dysfunction by chemical toxicity, and both CBMIDA and EHBP were effective agents to prevent these effects.
