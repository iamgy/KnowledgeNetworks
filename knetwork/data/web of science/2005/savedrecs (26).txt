The procedures include aggressive dissolution, separation by anion-exchange resin, separation and purification by extraction chromatography (e.g., TRU, TEVA and UTEVA resins) with measurement of the radionuclides by semiconductor alpha-spectrometry (SAS). Anion-exchange has proved to be a strong tool to treat large volume samples, and extraction chromatography shows an excellent selectivity and reduction of the amounts of acids. The results of thre analysis of uranium, thorium, plutonium and americium isotopes by this method in marine samples (IAEA-384, -385 and -414) provided excellent agreement with the recommended values with good chemical recoveries.

The initial study(1) was sponsored by the Department of Energy, Office of International Health Programs to evaluate and validate new technologies that may supersede the existing fission tract analysis (FTA) method for the analysis of Pu-239 in urine at the muBq/l level. The ultra-sensitive techniques evaluated in the second study included accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) by LLNL, thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) by LANL and FTA by the University of Utah. Only the results for the mass spectrometric methods will be presented. For the second study, the testing levels were approximately 4, 9, 29 and 56 muBq of Pu-239 per liter of synthetic urine. Each test sample also contained Pu-240 at a Pu-240/Pu-239 atom ratio of similar to0.15 and natural uranium at a concentration of 50 muBq/ml. From the results of the two studies, it can be inferred that the best performance at the muBq level is more laboratory specific than method specific. The second study demonstrated that LANL-TIMS and LLNL-AMS had essentially the same quantification level for both isotopes. Study results for bias and precision and acceptable performance compared to ANSI N13.30 and ANSI N42.22 have been compiled.

J	Gonzales, ER; Garcia, SR; Mahan, C; Hang, W				Gonzales, ER; Garcia, SR; Mahan, C; Hang, W			Evaluation of mass spectrometry and radiation detection for the analysis of radionuclides	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								Radioactive elements are of increasing importance in the areas of human health and safety, the environment, use in terrorism, and nuclear nonproliferation. Accurate and sensitive measurement of fission products, medical isotopes, and actinide species are a vital part of the job entrusted to the national laboratories. Several competing techniques exist. They can be mainly summarized into two categories: radiation and mass spectrometric detection methods. Traditional radiometric counting methods, which are based on the measurement of natural decay of radionuclides, play an important role in the detection of radionuclides. Fission track analysis, which uses thermal neutron induced fission to detect fissionable isotopes, now reaches a limit of detection (LOD) of 10(6) atoms. Of the mass spectrometric detection techniques, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, provides the best sensitivity for the cost in low-level determinations of long-lived radionuclides. Other methods, such as thermal ionization mass spec and accelerator mass spec can provide greater sensitivity in some cases but the cost is higher. Depending on the types of mass analyzers, LOD varies from ng/l to pg/l. More importantly, mass spectrometry is capable of offering precise isotopic ratio information that may act as a fingerprint for identifying the origins of nuclear materials. As the technology matures mass techniques now can provide suitable detection of the shorter-lived isotopes. This criterion is critical as the prompt determination of radionuclides is becoming of overriding importance. This work provides radiometric information displayed in a manner that allows for easy comparison to mass counting. The information can then be used as a general guide to determine the most suitable method to use for the prompt determination of radionuclides.

The U.S. Department of Energy requires bioassay laboratories which have the ability to detect a 100 mRem, 50-year committed effective dose equivalent (CEDE) intake of radioactive material. For PuO2, traditional alpha-spectrometry methods are not sensitive enough to meet this specification. To comply with this requirement, a radiochemical TIMS method was developed to determine Pu in urine bioassay samples. Four radiochemical separation steps were used to purify Pu from urine to ensure samples were free from matrix effects that interfere with TIMS analysis. These included precipitation, ion-extraction chromatography, electrodeposition, and ion-exchange chromatography. A batch of reagent blanks determined the detection limit for this method was 0.59 fg Pu-239/l (1.3 muBq Pu-239/l). The Pu-239 concentration was also measured in 20 urine blank samples to determine the minimum Pu-239 concentration that would indicate an occupational intake. A Probit plot was constructed for the results and the 99th percentile of the urine blanks showed that the minimum Pu-239 concentration that would indicate an uptake was 2.4 fg/l (5.5muBq/l).

AMS is characterized by a high rejection of interferences and a low susceptibility to matrix components, which reduce the demands on sample preparation chemistry. At Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (CAMS), we have developed an AMS capability for the measurement of actinide concentrations and isotopic ratios. To date, this capability has been primarily devoted to the measurement of Pu-239 and Pu-240 in bioassay and environmental samples including soils, sediments, waters, and human urine. For these analyses, a known amount of Pu-242 is added to the samples as a reference isotope for normalization. Measurements of standard and intercomparison samples have shown that quantification is accurate and precise from at least 10(6) to 10(11) atoms/sample. Recently, the ratios of Pu-240, Pu-241, Pu-242, and Pu-244 to intrinsic Pu-239 have been successfully measured in soil samples from nuclear test sites. In addition, initial measurements of U and Np isotopes have yielded results consistent with the Pu measurements with respect to sensitivity, accuracy, precision, and linear range.

Ge-68 is obtained by a (p,x) induced nuclear reaction on natural Ga. A typical Ga target assembly consists of liquid Ga contained in a Nb capsule, since Nb is one of the few metals resistant to liquid Ga. Zirconium-88 (83.4 d, via Nb-93(p, alpha2n)) is one longer-lived radioisotope generated by the proton irradiation of naturally mono-isotopic Nb-93. It decays into Y-88, which, in turn, has been considered a useful radiolabel surrogate for Y-90 in the investigation of radiolabeled compounds for cancer radioimmunotherapy.

Because of the need for very high specific activity products, methods other than direct neutron capture reactions (n, gamma-elastic and n,n'-inelastic routes) are required to insure that the highest specific activity-and hopefully no carrier added (nca)-radioisotopes are available. Two major methods to obtain nca radioisotopes from reactors are through the use of radionuclide generator systems using reactor produced parents and the formation of desired radioisotopes through beta-decay of reactor-produced species. In this paper we describe our recent development of new approaches to obtain nca Lu-177 from the decay of reactor-produced Yb-177 and free of the long-lived Lu-177m (T-1/2 = 160 d) radiocontaminant. We also describe preliminary results of our new "indirect" method for the production of Pt-195m via decay of Ir-195m, reactor produced by neutron irradiation of highly enriched Ir-193.

The coordination compound [Re-186g]Re-HEDP has proved to be a successful bone seeking agent for palliation of metastatic bonepain. Chemical, radiochemical and radionuclidic purity of commercial radiopharmaceutical [Re-186g]Re-HEDP have been checked by means by gamma- and beta- spectrometries, INAA and paper radiochromatography. The results indicate a good radionuclidic purity, with levels of contamination from the short-lived Re-188 well below the required specifications. After injection of the radiopharmaceutical, the radiochemical measurements conducted in vivo, on biological matrices, blood, plasma and urine, have shown that, entering the systemic circulation, Re-186g dissociates from the bis-phosphonate complex as hydrosoluble [Re-186g]ReO4-, and the two chemical species follow different biokinetics.

O-15 was prepared by N-14(d,n)O-15 reaction and 10 ml of O-15 labeled water (2 GBq) was supplied from the root of a soybean plant. To detect activity, an imaging plate (IP) as well as a BGO detector system were used. Since the half-life of O-15 is extremely short, (T-1/2 = 122 s), water uptake measurement was performed only for 20 minutes. In order to get [O-15]water image, an IP was exposed to the plant for 1 minute for two times. Since the exposure to an IP requires dark condition, a BGO detector system was developed to measure [O-15]water under light condition. A couple of BGO probes was set at the lowest stem and the gamma-rays (0.511 MeV) emitted from the radionuclide were measured through coincidence counting and compared with the radioactivity measured from an IP image. Using this system, we have found that the water uptake activity of the plant was drastically reduced under high humidity (99%) and dark condition.

Transient calculations for a three-dimensional (3-D) model have been carried out for both 20 and 10 wt.% HLW-bearing synroc, for surface cooling periods between reactor discharge and geological disposal varying from 5 to 40 years. This study investigates the temperature distribution in one of the boreholes of a hypothetical tunnel for a basic geometrical setting as well as the effect of varying the distance between adjacent boreholes and the distance between adjacent tunnels. The temperatures in the repository were found to be sensitive to the interim surface cooling period as well as the amount of waste loaded. The results showed that decreasing the spacing between the canisters has a more pronounced effect on the temperature field than decreasing the spacing between the tunnels. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

As opposed to the 1995 test spectra, where reference values were made available only for the peak energies and areas, the new set of test spectra was acquired with certified sources, so that the reference values are radionuclide activities. Two well-defined detection geometries were employed: a 500 ml Marinelli beaker on a 33% relative efficiency HPGe detector; and a 100ml pillbox on a 96% HPGe detector. The complete set addresses various issues that are especially important in low-level gamma-ray spectrometry. i.e. determination of efficiency curves, in the presence of coincidence summing, differences in source geometry and density between standard and sample, poor statistics, shielding of background by the sample, use of low X- or gamma-ray energies and the assumption of secular equilibrium of the natural radionuclides. The set was used in an IAEA intercomparison of software packages in December, 2002, reported on in a separate paper. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

With each program, efficiency curves were obtained for the two counting geometries (a 500 ml Marinelli beaker on a 33% relative efficiency HPGe detector, and a 100ml pillbox on a 96.3% HPGe detector) and subsequently used to obtain radionuclide activities for the unknown samples. Both the calibration sources and the unknown samples contained radionuclides giving rise to cascade summing effects. Cascade summing correction factors as obtained with some of these programs, as well as with GESPECOR, were compared directly. After the intercomparison meeting, the activities obtained were compared with the certified activities that had been kept secret until then. In this paper, the results will be presented and suggestions made for further improvement of the software. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The high chemical erosion rates, and co-deposition of tritium, are the main drawbacks of carbon as a plasma-facing material in fusion devices. Detailed knowledge about the evolution of the a-C:H layers and the behavior of sputtered hydrocarbon species is hence important in order to determine the fusion plasma dilution and the growth of hydrocarbon films on fusion device first walls. Cumulative bombardment simulations were performed of helium, neon, argon and hydrogen ions impinging onto a-C:H surfaces by employing reactive hydrocarbon potential models. The simulations were run for a noble gas/hydrogen ratio of 1/10, and at ion energies of 5 and 10 eV. At this ratio we find no significant differences between the sputtering yields of the different noble gas ions. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Multiple electron loss in single collisions was found to contribute significantly to the total loss cross section. The measured cross sections were used to determine the average equilibrium charge in argon by three different methods. The resulting charges were in good agreement with each other and with the effective charge calculated from stopping powers. In order to investigate the gas-solid (density) effect on the average equilibrium charge, the charge distributions of 3.5 MeV/amu uranium ions emerging from carbon foils of different thicknesses were measured. It was found that the average equilibrium charge of the uranium ions emerging from the solid is 41 % larger than that of the uranium ions emerging from the gas. The energy dependences of the average equilibrium charges for uranium ions exiting carbon and argon targets were examined by combining the present results with previous results of other investigators and compared with the predictions of a semiempirical formula developed recently by Schiwietz and Grande.

Independent age determinations with the population method are problematic due to different track counting efficiencies (Q) for rho(s) in unannealed and rho(i) in annealed titanite. Independent age determinations with the external detector method depend on correction factors for the track registration geometries (G = 0.5), counting efficiencies (Q) and range deficit (R = 1.38); however, Q is unaffected by annealing. It was attempted to determine GQR through calculation, direct experiment and on the basis of age standards. The direct experiment involves measurements of the ratio of the induced-track densities in titanite and a co-irradiated external detector. The track densities in the internal titanite surfaces Could not be measured but the results for the external surfaces confirm that this approach leads to a significant overestimation of GQR, due to prior annealing. The GQR-values determined on the basis of age standards are consistent with that obtained by calculation assuming that Q approximate to 1, although there is no experimental confirmation for this fact apart from their isotropic etching characteristics. The fact that identical GQR-factors were obtained on standards of different age and uranium content suggests that a single GQR-value is appropriate for dating titanites within a broad range of radiation damage. In terms of the zeta-calibration this implies that a single zeta-factor is also suitable for dating different titanites. These findings suggest that other factors besides the accumulation of alpha-recoil damage, such as a phase transition, could be co-responsible for the different etching characteristics of annealed and unannealed titanites.

The wear of the polyethylene component is the major cause for long-term failure of these prostheses since the wear debris leads to adverse biological reactions. The polyethylene wear is usually measured by gravimetric methods, which are limited due to a low sensitivity and accuracy. To demonstrate the reliability of ultra thin layer activation (UTLA) as an alternative technique, wear tests on a cross-linked ultra-high-molecular weight polyethylene (XLPE) sliding against CoCrMo were performed on a wear tester featuring multi-directional sliding motion. The amount of polyethylene wear was evaluated by both UTLA and gravimetry. The particular TLA method used in this work employed the implantation of 7 Be radioactive recoils into the polyethylene surface by means of a light mass particle beam. The results indicate that apart from its relatively high sensitivity, UTLA also offers the possibility for on-line measurements of polyethylene wear. This makes it a viable and complementary technique in wear test studies for medical implant purposes especially for those involving wear resistant materials and for rapid wear screening.

Autoradiographs and discussions with source manufacturers indicated this assumption of the radionuclide physical distribution may be invalid Consequently, clinical dose distributions would be in error when not accounting for these internal variations. Many implants use brachytherapy sources with four I-125 resin beads and two radiopaque markers used for imaging. Monte Carlo methods were used to determine dose contributions from each of the resin beads. These contributions were compared with those from an idealized source having a uniform physical distribution. Upon varying the I-125 physical distribution while retaining the same overall radioactivity, the dose distribution along the transverse plane remained constant within 5% for r > 0.5 cm. For r less than or equal to 0.5 cm, relative positioning of the resin beads dominated the shielding effects, and dose distributions varied up to a factor of 3 at r = 0.05 cm. For points off the transverse plane, comparisons of the uniform and nonuniform dose distributions produced larger variations. Shielding effects within the capsule were virtually constant along the source long axis and demonstrated that anisotropy variations among the four resin beads were dependent on internal component positioning.

The MCNP4C code was deployed to model and assess the neutron multiplication parameters of pool-based storage and dry transport containers under various loading patterns and moderating conditions. To comply with standard safety requirements, fresh 4.25% enriched nuclear fuel was assumed. The impact of potential optimum moderation due to water steam or foam formation as well as of different interpretations, of neutron multiplication through varying the system boundary conditions was elaborated. The simulations indicate that in the case of compact (all rack locations filled with fresh fuel) single or "double tiering" loading, the supercriticality can occur under the conditions of enhanced neutron moderation, due to accidentally reduced density of cooling water. Under standard operational conditions the effective multiplication factor (k(eff)) of pool-based storage facility remains below the specified safety limit of 0.95. The nuclear safety requirements are fulfilled even when the fuel elements are arranged at a minimal distance, which can be initiated, for example, by an earthquake. The dry container in its recommended loading scheme with 26 fuel elements represents a safe alternative for the repository, of fresh fuel. Even in the case of complete water flooding, the keff remains below the specified safety level of 0.98. The criticality safety limit may however be exceeded with larger amounts of loaded fuel assemblies (i.e., 32). Additional Monte Carlo criticality safety analyses are scheduled to consider the "burnup credit" of PWR spent nuclear fuel, based on the ongoing calculation of typical burnup activities.

The parameters k(s) and k(eff) have been researched for a nuclear critical safety, experiment assembly using a uranium solution. The parameter k(s), was measured by the source multiplication method, while the parameter k(eff) was measured by the power-raising period method.

For instance the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) shows an increase between 2000 and 2050 by a factor of 2.5 in global primary energy and the installed nuclear capacity will increase by about a factor of 4-5 as a median value. The technologies for the nuclear energy are continuously improving towards the long-term goals of further improvements in economics, very high levels of safety, increased proliferation resistance, and successful implementation of solutions for radioactive waste disposal. By statute, the IAEA is authorized to encourage and assist the Member States efforts for the practical application of nuclear technology.

In G/VCR systems the functions of fuel and coolant are combined and the reactor outlet temperature is not constrained by solid fuel-cladding temperature limitations. G/VCRs can potentially provide the highest reactor and cycle temperature among all existing or proposed fission reactor designs. Furthermore, G/VCR systems feature a low inventory and fully integrated fuel cycle with exceptional sustainability and safety characteristics. With respect to fuel utilization, there is practically no fuel burn-up limit for gas core reactors due to continuous recycling of the fuel. Owing to flexibility in nuclear design characteristics of cavity reactors, a wide range of conversion ratio from almost solely a burner to a breeder is achievable. The continuous recycling of fuel in G/VCR systems allows for continuous burning and transmutation of actinides without removing and reprocessing of the fuel. The only waste product at the backend of the gas core reactors' fuel cycle is fission fragments that are continuously separated from the fuel. As a result the G/VCR systems do not require spent fuel storage or reprocessing. G/VCR systems also feature outstanding proliferation resistance characteristics and minimum vulnerability to external threats. Even for comparable spectral characteristic, gas core reactors produce fissile plutonium two orders of magnitude less than Light Water Reactors (LWRs). In addition, the continuous transmutation and burning of actinides further reduces the quality of the fissile plutonium inventory. The low fuel inventory (about two orders of magnitude lower than LWRs for the same power generation level) combined with continuous burning of actinides, significantly reduces the need for emergency planning and the vulnerability to external threats. Low fuel inventory, low fuel heat content, and online separation of fission fragments are among the key constituent safety features of G/VCR systems. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Sekimoto, H				Sekimoto, H			Application of candle burnup strategy for future nuclear energy utilization	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st COE-INES International Symposium (INES-1)	OCT 31-NOV 04, 2004	Tokyo, JAPAN			CANDLE burnup; fast reactor; high temperature gas cooled reactor; HTGR; LWR; nuclear equilibrium state; toxicity balance; neutron economy; high burnup	EQUILIBRIUM	The CANDLE burnup strategy is a new reactor burnup concept, where the distributions of fuel nuclide densities, neutron flux, and power density move with the same constant speed along the core axis from bottom to top (or from top to bottom) of the core and without any change in their shapes. Therefore, any burnup control mechanisms are not required, and reactor characteristics do not change along burnup. The reactor is simple and safe. If this burnup scheme is applied to some neutron rich fast reactors, either natural or depleted uranium can be utilized as fresh fuel after second core and the burnup of discharged fuel is about 40%. It means about 40% of natural or depleted uranium can be utilized without either enrichment or reprocessing. In the ideal nuclear energy utilization system, the radioactive toxicity in the environment should remain or decrease after the utilization. This requirement is very severe and difficult to be satisfied. It may take too much time for its realization. The CANDLE burnup may substitute this period. Though it is a once-through fuel cycle, the discharged fuel burnup is about ten times of the present value for light water reactors. The space necessary for final disposal can be drastically reduced. However, in order to realize such a high burnup of discharged fuels some innovative technologies should be developed. Either new material standing still for such a high burnup or intermediate recladding will be required. Especially new fuel development will take a lot of time. For the time being a small reactor with CANDLE burnup may be a good option for nuclear power generation. Even this kind of reactor requires some innovative technologies and a long period for their developments. For the first stage of CANDLE burnup the prismatic fuel high-temperature gas cooled reactor is preferable. Since the design of this reactor fits to the CANDLE burnup very well, only a little time is required for its research and development. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Several key designs have been investigated, taking into account both PWR and BWR technologies. The Package-Reactor is designed to attain high reliability, high safety, good maintainability, good operability and low construction cost. To achieve the aims, its nuclear steam supply system adopts the natural-circulation core cooling system, and the reactivity-control-free system, under normal operation. The core assembly is composed of several sub-cores. Each sub-core is housed in a pressure tube called "cassette". The cycle length is five years, by using UO2 fuel with 5wt% enrichment. The containment vessel is small and the nuclear steam supply system can be constructed through ground transportation. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The reactor technology was built from that of conventional LWRs. The reactor core consists of 12 cassettes containing fuel rods with a similar design to that of PWR fuel rods. Each cassette has about a 0.4 m outer diameter and they are fixed with about 0.5 m pitch to each other in the atmospheric pressure condition. A tube-type control cluster was developed. It can decrease the rise of reactivity for the one-rod-stuck condition. An advanced cassette design was studied in which the down-comer is placed at the center of the fuel region. This concept, which improves neutron economics and the cold shutdown margin, will increase the marketability of the Package-Reactor. An operation period of more than 8 years can be achieved with UO2 fuel enrichment of 5.0wt%. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The reactor core of KAMADO consists of fuel elements of graphite blocks, which have UO2 fuel rods and cooling water holes. These fuel elements are located in a reactor water pool of atmospheric pressure (1 atm) and low temperature (< 60 degrees C). In case of LOCA, decay heat from fuel rods is removed by conduction heat transfer to the reactor water pool. Since the cooling water does not contact a fuel rod directly, core design has much flexibility without considering dry-out limitation and Minimum Critical Power Ratio (MCPR). Additionally an effective use of spent fuel is expected. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This kind of nuclear system can be expected to have some good characteristic such as resource efficiency, radiotoxicity reduction, proliferation and nuclear safety. Therefore, the feasibility of the concept is studied in this paper. The preliminary results show that the system of 100% natural uranium burning with once-through fuel cycle is physically possible with a plenty supply of external neutron, and that the system demands no activities concerning with fuel cycle such as uranium enrichment, fuel fabrication, spent fuel reprocessing and radioactive waste treatment. The study also quantitatively clarifies the external neutron source strength, the nuclear criticality safety, the demanded accelerator performance and the energy balance. In addition, the more precise analysis is requested for well understanding and improving the characteristic and economical rationality of the system. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mixed uranium-plutonium mononitride fuel composition allows supporting in BREST reactor CBR approximate to 1. It is not required to separate plutonium to produce "fresh" fuel. Coarse recovered fuel purification of fission products is allowed (residual content of FPs may be in the range of 10(-2) - 10(-3) of their content in the irradiated fuel). High activity of the regenerated fuel caused by minor actinides is a radiation barrier against fuel thefts. The fuel cycle of the BREST type reactors "burns" uranium-238, which must be added to the fuel during reprocessing. Plutonium is not extracted during reprocessing being a part of fuel composition, thus exhibiting an important nonproliferation feature. The radiation equivalence between natural uranium consumed by the BREST NPP closed system and long-lived high-level radwaste is provided by actinides (U, Pu, Am) transmutation in the fuel and long-lived products (I, Tc) transmutation in the blanket.

A couple of approaches are considered - using different fuel dimensions and using different enrichment levels across the core. Three new cores with flattened power distribution are successfully designed: Design-I uses different fuel rod diameters but uniform fuel composition; Design-II uses different fuel enrichment in the radial direction but uniform fuel rod dimensions; Design-III is similar to Design-II but uses enrichment splitting also in the axial direction. Relative to the reference ENHS core, the BOL peak-to-average channel power ratio is reduced from 1.50 to 1.15, 1.22 and 1.15 and the average discharge burnup increases by 8.5%, 27.9% and 41.2% for, respectively, Design-I, -II and -III. The corresponding burnup reactivity swings over 20 years of full power operation are 0.37%, 0.52% and 0.60% relative to 0.22% of the reference design. Design-II and -III have a negative coolant expansion reactivity defect while in the reference design this defect is positive. The radial power flattening increases the reactivity worth of the peripheral absorbers of the three new designs while the central absorber reactivity worth is reduced but their sum is nearly maintained. The newly designed cores have slightly more positive coolant void reactivity worth than the reference ENHS core. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Results of the core survey analyses in order to find out the feasibility of this concept, taking example for BWR MOX spent fuel of 60 GWd/t burn-up, show that four times recycling of LWR spent fuel with the burn-up of more than 300 GWd/t can be achieved without increasing MA content. Such benefits will be expected in this concept as reduction of fuel cycle cost due to simplified reprocessing procedure, reduction of environmental impacts due to reduced high level waste, efficient utilization of nuclear fuel resources, enhancement of nuclear non-proliferation, and suppression of LWR spent fuel pile-up.

It can be applied easily to a block-type high temperature gas cooled reactor (HTGR) using an appropriate burnable poison with a high neutron absorption cross section mixed with uranium oxide fuel. In this study, natural gadolinium is used as burnable poison. In the present paper, the simulation of the burnup for the steady state and the startup is performed. For the steady state simulation with direct solutions of steady state nuclide densities as inputs, the difference between the results of the steady state analysis and the simulation analysis is very small. It confirms that the steady state analysis is correct.

There has been a lot of research activities world-wide with various approaches to transmuter design, matrix for waste incorporation and end waste form. This diversity comes from differently formulated transmutation priorities which, in their turn, originated in differently formulated strategy for development of nuclear fuel cycles. The present paper aims at surveying the goals of waste transmutation in view of trends identified in the past decade and address some new characteristics for estimating its radiological cost.

Its superiority lies also in the fact that it makes possible to utilize actinides contained, by others, in spent nuclear fuel and so to reach a positive energy effect. The SPHINX project has been proposed by the consortium TRANSMUTATION being established by four leading nuclear research bodies in the Czech Republic (Nuclear Research Institute Rez plc, SKODA Nuclear Machinery plc in Pilsen, Nuclear Physics Institute of Academy of Sciences in Rez and Technical University in Praha) at the end of 1996 to which Technical University in Brno (specialized for a secondary circuit problems) has associated in the year 2000. The project has been supported by the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic, CEZ, a.s. (Czech Electricity Generating Company) and RAWRA (Radwaste Repository Authority). The R&D program of the SPHINX project contains an experimental part, which serves for a verification of design inputs for designing a demonstration unit of a transmuter with liquid fuel based on molten fluorides. The current status of the experimental program performance has been focused upon the irradiation of samples of molten-salt systems as well as structural materials proposed for the blanket of the SPHINX transmuter in the field of high neutron flux of research reactors. The main aims of this program called Irradiated Probes BLANKA are the following: (1) Experimental verification of long time behavior of transmuter blanket which contains molten fluoride salts as a fuel and coolant, (2) Validation of computational code system being developed for the computation of actinides concentration in long- term operation of the transmuter, and (3) Material research (C) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Takibayev, A; Saito, M; Artisyuk, V; Sagara, H				Takibayev, A; Saito, M; Artisyuk, V; Sagara, H			Fusion-driven transmutation of selected long-lived fission products	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st COE-INES International Symposium (INES-1)	OCT 31-NOV 04, 2004	Tokyo, JAPAN			transmutation; fission products; fusion neutron source	NUCLEAR-ENERGY SYSTEM; NEUTRON SOURCE	The long-term radiological burden associated with nuclear power production is usually attributed to long-lived fission products (LLFP). Their lifetime and large equilibrium mass and hence radioactivity accumulated in the course of fission energy generation make their storage a rather formidable task to solve. Therefore the idea of artificial incineration of LLFP through their transmutation has been quite naturally incorporated into the concept of self-consistent nuclear energy system (SCNES) based primarily on fast breeder reactor technologies. However it is now acknowledged that neutron environment of fission facilities including fast breeder reactors does not seem most appropriate for LLFP transmutation. The issue has been then extensively developed within the framework of multi-component self-consistent nuclear energy system (MCSCNES). Neutrons of specific quality required for LLFP transmutation are proposed there to be of non-fission origin. Given neutron excess available and neutron quality, a fusion neutron source (FNS) is appearing as the candidate No. 1 to consider for LLFP transmutation. Research on LLFP transmutation by means of FNS has very long history and has received an additional boost during the decade passed. In the present study, potential of thermal flux blanket of FNS is exemplified by transmutation of Zr-93 and Sn-126, the most difficult LLFP to transmute. It is shown that transmutation of Zr-93 is effective even with a rather modest neutron loading of 1 MWt center dot m(-2), typical for ITER project. Transmutation of Sn-126, however, requires neutron loading of as high as 3 MWt center dot m(-2) for DD fusion and is quite unattractive for DT fusion. In the latter case, transmutation through the threshold (n,2n) reaction may be preferable. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is possible to achieve energy security and sustainability through the introduction of fast reactors in an expeditious manner and closing the fuel cycle. This approach is inevitable in view of the limited uranium resources in India The Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR) built by India uses mixed carbide as fuel and the 500 MW(e) Fast Breeder Reactor Project (PFBR), to be operational in 2010, will use mixed oxide as fuel. It has also been decided that fast reactors beyond 2020, with enhanced safety features and having better economy, will use metallic fuel. Having successfully operated FBTR with carbide fuels, we need to develop the fuel cycles for both the mixed oxide fuel in the near future and the metallic fuel expeditiously. The progress achieved so far and the plans for implementation are discussed in this paper. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The proposed system is a hybrid system that combines fluoride volatility and solvent extraction methods. Spent fuel will be sheared and cladding material will be removed by dry oxidation/reduction method such as AIROX process. Fluorination and purification of most uranium can be easily achieved by fluoride volatility method with compact facility. About 10% residues including plutonium can be treated in well-established PURER method, which means this facility load will be about 1/10 of the conventional PURER facility with same capacity. Between fluorination process and PURER process, there is a pyrohydrolysis process where the fluoride compounds from fluorination process are converted to the oxides. Pure mixture of Pu and U can be obtained by solvent extraction method without separating Pu and U, which is suitable for conventional MOX fuel fabrication. The system can recover pure U and MOX with the decontamination factor of over 10(7) and can drastically reduce the cost and waste generation compared with the conventional one. Semi engineering scale experiments for the fluorination, pyrohydrolysis, and dissolution of Pu containing materials were carrierd out. From those experimental results, key elemental processes were fundamentally proofed. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper reports the effective separation of Am through the use of a chelating ion-exchange method that uses an octylphenyl-N,N-diisobutylcarbomoyl phosphine oxide (CMPO) or thiacalix[4]arene compound impregnated silica ion-exchanger. The separation of Cs and Sr from HLLW can be achieved using a CMPO impregnated silica ion-exchanger (CMPO-exchanger). Actinoids and lanthanoids can then be eluted from the CMPO-exchanger, with the resulting solution then treated to separate the actinoids using a thiacalix[4]arene compound impregnated silica ion-exchanger. Thiacalix[4]arene compound impregnated silica ion-exchangers have been shown to effectively separate actinoids from lanthanoids in a weak-acid solution. The influence of gamma ray irradiation on adsorption is also investigated. The adsorption of Am remains high even after irradiation of the ion-exchanger. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It was confirmed that NCP has sufficient precipitation ability for UO22+ ions, decontamination capability (separation of UO22+ from simulated fission products), and resistance to gamma-ray radiation in nitric acid solutions. These findings indicate that NCP is applicable to our reprocessing process. We have also evaluated performances of other precipitants such as N-n-propyl-2-pyrrolidone (NProP), N-n-butyl-2-pyrrolidone (NBP), and N-n-butyl-2-pyridone (NBPyr). It was found that higher decontamination factors (DFs) are obtained by using NProP and NBP. This can be interpreted that the hydrophobicity of NProP and NBP is lower than that of NCP. Furthermore, we have obtained an experimental result that the resistance of NBPyr to gamma-ray radiation is superior to that of NCP. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

On the basis of fundamental studies on precipitation behaviors, we designed and built up the scaled-up laboratory equipments (1/20-scale of future plant capacity of 200 tHM/y) to evaluate technological and economical feasibility. This system, which mainly consists of a precipitator and a precipitate separator, should be operated continuously from economical reasons. From the experimental results, it was confirmed that the precipitator is capable of producing UO22+-NCP precipitate stably with stipulated residence time (approximately 30 min), and the precipitate separator has the highly efficient separation of precipitate from the slurry. Furthermore, the parametric experiments indicated that the rinsing operation increased the efficiency in decontamination of FP elements. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The ammonium ion adsorption band initially charged in the resin bed using 0.5 mol center dot dm(-3) NH4OH solution and was eluted in a reverse breakthrough manner. The temperature of column was kept constant at 308K by temperature-controlled water through a jacket. A constant length of adsorbed bands were maintained throughout the elution. The enrichment of N-14 at the front boundary region and N-15 at the rear boundary region were confirmed. The attention was placed on enrichment high purity of N-14 (99.99%). An enrichment factor of N-14 was determined to be 0.026 +/- 0.001 and HETP was evaluated 0.18 cm. HETP of front boundary region is obviously lager than that of the rear part. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In the H-1-NMR spectrum of the BMINfO solution prepared by dissolving UO2(ClO4)(2)center dot 5.6H(2)O, the signal of H2O coordinated to UO22+ was observed at 6.64 ppm at 50 degrees C (free H2O in BMINfO: similar to 3.1 ppm at 50 degrees C), suggesting that the uranyl species exists as the aquo complex, [UO2(H2O)(n)](2+). The signal of the coordinated H2O disappears with heating at 120 degrees C for 3 h under vacuum. This indicates the dehydration from [UO2(H2O)(n)](2+). On the other hand, the Cl-35-NMR signal of ClO4- as the counter anion of UO22+ was observed at 1011 ppm (vs. Cl- in D2O) regardless of heating. This indicates that no ClO4- ion is in the first coordination sphere of UO22+. Furthermore, the UV visible absorption spectra showed that the characteristic absorption bands due to UO22+ were sharpened with the dehydration. This means the simplification of the structure around UO22+. These results described above suggest that UO22+ in BMINfO has no ligand in its equatorial plane after the dehydration, i.e. UO22+ exists as a bare cation in this system. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

From the results of extraction experiments, it was found that the extraction of U(VI) in microchannel could be performed in a short time for approximately 1 s with a good extractability in both organic phases of 30% and 100% TBP, and suggested that the other nuclides could be extracted with high extraction efficiency in microchannel. Furthermore, it is expected that the innovative and sophisticated nuclide separation systems can be developed by using microchannel extraction with selective extractants for specific nuclide.

These wastes arose from nuclear power plants etc., constituting of nonflammable organic materials, such as fire resistant sheeting and rubber gloves. We investigated the distribution behavior of iron and cobalt attached to nonflammable organic materials, in solid, liquid and gas phases during the decomposition of this method. The distributions of these elements under various conditions (initial amounts) were determined by using their radioisotopes as simulated low-level radioactive wastes in order to ease the detection of trace amounts of elements even in solid and gas phases. Iron and cobalt were found only in the solid phase when non-radioactive iron hydroxide was added as a precipitation reagent before the supercritical-water reaction. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
