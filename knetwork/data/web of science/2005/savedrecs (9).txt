Using this model, defect species concentrations are determined. The model allows for the calculation of the non-stoichiometry of PuO2-x, as functions of temperature and oxygen pressure. A model of oxygen diffusion is proposed and the oxygen self and chemical diffusivities are calculated for temperatures in the (900-1400 degrees C) range and partial pressure of oxygen P-O2 is an element of (1-10(-25) atm). This work shows that, given appropriate parameters, the model is able to describe the non-stoichiometry and oxygen diffusivity in a reasonable way. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The y value of Zr0.5Pu0.5O2-y was varied at 1078 K over 0 <= y < 0.10 and the isothermal g(O-2) were measured by applying the coulomb titration method. The temperature dependence of the g(O-2) was also measured for each y by performing the temperature scan down to 793 K (793 <= T <= 1078 K). It was found that the g(O-2) decreased from similar to 0 to -480 kJ/mol with increasing y from similar to 0 to 0.1 at 1078 K and that the isothermal g(O-2) as a function of y exhibited a simple concave curve. The powder XRD results showed that Zr0.5Pu0.5O2-y maintained its single F-type structure over 0 <= y < 0.10 at 1078 K. The lattice parameters (a(0)) in this system were found to increase almost linearly with y over 0 <= y < 0. 10. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For each datapoint the oxygen pressure p(O2), the nonstoichiometry x, the temperature T and the uranium concentration y was specified. The data were analyzed using the valency control model and the thermochemical model of Lindemer and Besmann for UO2+x which was extended for the analysis of the Th1-yUyO2+x data. The solid solution is regarded as an ideal ternary solution of UO2, ThO2 and a hypothetical compound UaOb. The thermodynamic properties of this compound UaOb were determined in two oxygen pressure ranges of the database. In this thermochemical approach ThO2 is treated as an inert solvent that does not participate in any of the chemical equilibria describing the oxygen potential. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

It was assumed in the present model that (U, Pu, Am)O2-x consisted of the chemical species [UO2], [PuO2], [Pu4/3O2], [AmO2] and [AM(5/4)O(2)] in a pseudo-quaternary system by treating the reduction rates of Pu and Am as identical; furthermore an interaction between [AM(5/4)O(2)] and [UO2] was introduced. The agreement between analytical and experimental isotherms was good, but the analytical values slightly overestimated the experimental values especially in the case of lower Am content. Adding an interaction between [AM(5/4)O(2)] and [PuO2] to the model resulted in a better representation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The experimental results of (Pu0.3U0.7)O2-x show a consistent variation in P-O2 with O/M and temperature and are in agreement with other works. The relationship between the partial oxygen pressure and x in MO2-x was evaluated by the lattice defect theory. The relationship in the hypo-stoichiometric region was x proportional to P-O2(-1/2) near the stoichiometric composition, and became x proportional to P-O2(-1/3) with a decrease in O/M.

A Knudsen cell with a mass spectrometer was adapted to feed an adjustable oxygen flux up to temperatures of 1900 K producing an oxygen pressure in the cell ranging up to 1000 Pa. Experiments were carried out on fresh and irradiated fuels, both preoxidised to U3O8 or oxidised online in the Knudsen cell, to measure effects associated with fuel sublimation in the form of different uranium-bearing oxides.

The analysis revealed that a higher oxygen potential in the sintering atmosphere and a higher amount of M3O8 contributed to a lower sintered density but the formation of a larger average grain size in the microstructure of the sintered specimens. Moreover, it was revealed that the weight change during sintering with different amounts of M3O8 had an influence on the microstructural evolution and sintered density due to the difference in the oxygen potentials. This behavior is discussed in terms of the oxygen potential-density relationship, thermogravimetric behavior and microstructure evolution in the specimens. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Among the available corium physical characteristics, the knowledge of the final crystalline compounds and their quantities gives basic information about the physico-chemistry mechanisms and the solidification path (thermodynamic calculation). Meta-stable phases in the UO2-ZrO2 system (tetragonal solid solution), which appear during transient phases of severe accidents, have been observed in a recent real material experiment. A specific XRD (X-ray diffraction) approach has been developed for corium, analysis coupling identification of the solid solutions and Rietveld method for quantitative data. Similar transient phases had been characterized on samples coming from TMI-2 nuclear reactor corium samples. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Study of the active role played by UO2-ZrO2-FP interactions on irradiated fuel collapse temperature	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th International Symposium on Thermodynamics of Nuclear Materials	SEP 06-09, 2004	Karlsruhe, GERMANY				PROGRAM	The VERCORS experimental program was launched in order to study radionuclide release from standard PWR fuels and quantify the corresponding source term in severe-accident conditions. Performed by the CEA, it forms part of a larger program. concerning reactor-accident studies funded by the IRSN in collaboration with EDF. Twenty-five experiments have been performed leading to a large database regarding release of fission products and actinides from UO2 and MOX fuels under several types of atmosphere. The fuel burn-up ranges from 38 GWd/t to 70 GWd/t. Nearly all the tests were performed in such a way as to measure with some accuracy the fuel temperature. The present paper gives an overview of the program (i.e. sample and loop description, general FPs behaviour), with emphasis on the potential effect of UO2-ZrO2-FP interactions on fuel collapse temperature.

It was found that most of the volatile fission products such as Cs, Mo, and Te were released from the fuel matrix into the fuel-cladding gap, and then they axially migrated up and down to a low temperature region along the temperature gradient. As a result, agglomerates of fission products, known as JOG (Joint Oxyde Game), were dispersed in the high temperature axial gap region and were densely precipitated in the low temperature axial gap region. The microstructures of MOX fuel near the gap were restructured by the irradiation as follows. In the low temperature rim region, a re-crystallized sub-micron grain structure was observed just like in irradiated LWR fuel. In the high temperature rim region, a white ring region developed which was free from voids and had large sized grains. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Text mining was introduced to examine public comments to identify the core public interest underlying the comments. The utilized text mining method is to cluster specific groups of words with negative meanings and then to analyze public understanding by employing text structural analysis to extract words from subjective expressions. Using these procedures, it was found that the public does not trust the nuclear fuel cycle promotion policy and shows signs of anxiety about the Iona-lasting technological reliability of waste storage. To develop effective social risk communication of HLW issues. these findings are expected to help experts in the nuclear industry to communicate with the general public more effectively to obtain their trust.

The MOX particles entrainment occurs and some of them are transiting to the outlet of GB without deposition to floor and wall. The entraining rate and the transiting rate are reported as Airborne Release Fraction (ARF) and Respirable Fraction (RF) in the literatures. However, no activities of model development and analytical approach have been found for ARF and RE Thus, a feasibility study is done in this paper on the behavior of MOX particles in GB such as entraining and transiting. A modeling code has been developed by improving AQUA-SF code and the RF values for abnormal occurrences, such as free-fall spill, outflow and fire, have been analyzed and compared with those reported. This paper also shows the analytical results of the improved code together with the simulated experimental results. It is found that the calculated values are almost corresponded to those reported and that the improved code can estimate MOX particle behavior in GB well.

Noble metal-deposited type 304 stainless steel specimens with an oxide film were exposed to the simulated HWC condition, including co-existing Co radioactivity. Relationships between features of the oxide film which had two layers and the accumulation and distribution of Co radioactivity in the oxide film were established. The outer layer of the oxide film which consisted of alpha-Fe2O3, Fe3O4 and NiFe2O4 was dissolved by noble metal deposition and exposure to the HWC condition. The reasons for this were as follows. Solubility of alpha-Fe2O3, Fe3O4 and NiFe2O4 increased with the decrease of electrochemical corrosion potential. Dissolution of these compounds was accelerated by the anodic reaction of hydrogen which is catalyzed by noble metal. Co radioactivity was mainly incorporated into the inner layer. This was caused by the substitution of radioactive Co ions for ferrous ions in the oxide film, based on the observation that growth of the oxide film and oxidation of base metal stopped in the HWC condition. The inner layer consisted of FeCr2O4 which is stable at low ECP and it did not dissolve. Co radioactivity was not incorporated into the outer layer because it dissolved.

About 5 GBq of tritium is discharged yearly from the KURR stack. The concentrations of tritium in the exhaust air, atmospheric moisture and precipitates were monitored to estimate not only any effects of tritium sources on the concentrations in the nearby environment but also the dilution factor of pollutants at the site boundary. The concentrations of tritium in surface water at the site were also monitored to identify the possibility of pollution in the water system. In both cases, there was slight contamination in samples near the site. The increased annual dose to an adult from tritium discharged in the atmosphere was estimated to be about five orders of magnitude lower than that from natural background radiation.

J	Boice, JD; Mumma, MT; Blot, WJ; Heath, CW				Boice, JD; Mumma, MT; Blot, WJ; Heath, CW			Childhood cancer mortality in relation to the St Lucie nuclear power station	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article							DECIDUOUS TEETH; SOLID TUMORS; IRRADIATION; INFECTIONS; FACILITIES; COHORT; SR-90	An unusual county-wide excess of childhood cancers of brain and other nervous tissue in the late 1990s in St Lucie County, Florida, prompted the Florida Department of Health to conduct a case-control study within the county assessing residential chemical exposures. No clear associations were found, but claims were then made that the release of radioactive substances such as strontium 90 from the St Lucie nuclear power station, which began operating in 1976, might have played a role. To test the plausibility of this hypothesis, we extended by 17 years a previous study of county mortality conducted by the National Cancer Institute. Rates of total cancer, leukaemia and cancer of brain and other nervous tissue in children and across all ages in St Lucie County were evaluated with respect to the years before and after the nuclear power station began operation and contrasted with rates in two similar counties in Florida (Polk and Volusia). Over the prolonged period 1950-2000, no unusual patterns of childhood cancer mortality were found for St Lucie County as a whole. In particular, no unusual patterns of childhood cancer mortality were seen in relation to the start-up of the St Lucie nuclear power station in 1976. Further, there were no significant differences in mortality between the study and comparison counties for any cancer in the time period after the power station was in operation. Relative rates for all childhood cancers and for childhood leukaemia were higher before the nuclear facility began operating than after, while rates of brain and other nervous tissue cancer were slightly lower in St Lucie County than in the two comparison counties for both time periods. Although definitive conclusions cannot be drawn from descriptive studies, these data provide no support for the hypothesis that the operation of the St Lucie nuclear power station has adversely affected the cancer mortality experience of county residents.

Results show that the concentrations of K-40, U-238 and Th-232 in the soil samples varied from below detection limits (BDL) to 1459.4 Bq kg(-1) with a mean of 73.3 +/- 18.5 Bq kg(-1) for K-40, whereas for U-238 and 232Th values varied from 9.2 to 113.7 Bq kg(-1) with a mean of 33.9 +/- 7.4 Bq kg(-1) and from BDL to 175.7 Bq kg(-1) with a mean of 12.4 +/- 3.1 Bq kg(-1), respectively. The average gamma absorbed dose rate in air across the cities ranged between 19 +/- 5 and 88 +/- 44 nGy h(-1) and the gross mean was 42.0 +/- 21.0 nGy h(-1). Using available population data in the study areas, about 2.84% of the population is exposed to a radiation dose rate of less than 20 nGy h(-1), 52.40% to a radiation dose rate between 20 and 30 nGy h(-1), 31% to aradiation dose rate between 30 and 60 nGy h(-1) and about 13.76% to dose rates greater than 60 nGy h(-1).

These options should inspire public confidence. Now, more than halfway into the time allotted, we, as two former members of the Committee, express our concerns at the wayward approach that has been adopted. The Committee has placed emphasis on gaining public confidence but this has been done at the expense of recruiting the best scientific expertise in the management of radioactive waste, an act which we believe will actually undermine public confidence. Furthermore, given also the immense importance of this decision to public safety, national security and the national interest, we believe urgent steps should be taken to review the Committee's process, its management and its sponsorship.

J	Yun, JI; Suh, KY; Kang, CS				Yun, JI; Suh, KY; Kang, CS			Heat and fission product transport in molten core material pool with crust	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							HIGH-POWER REACTORS; VESSEL LOWER PLENA; SEVERE ACCIDENT; NATURAL-CONVECTION; INTEGRAL ANALYSIS; PHASE GROWTH; RETENTION; CATCHER; RELEASE; LAYER	Heat transfer and fluid flow in a molten pool are influenced by internal volumetric heat generated from the radioactive decay of fission product species retained in the reactor vessel during a severe accident. The pool superheat is determined based on the overall energy balance that equates the heat production rate to the heat loss rate. Decay heat of fission products in the pool is estimated by product of the mass concentration and energy conversion factor of each fission product. Twenty-nine elements are chosen and classified by their chemical properties to calculate heat generation rate in the pool. The mass concentration of a fission product is obtained from released fraction and the tabular output of the ORIGEN 2 code. The initial core and pool inventories at each time can also be estimated using ORIGEN 2. The released fraction of each fission product is calculated based on the bubble dynamics and mass transport. Numerical analysis is performed for heat and fission product transport in a molten core material pool during the Three Mile Island Unit 2 (TMI-2) accident. The pool is assumed to be a partially filled hemisphere, whose change in geometry is neglected during the numerical calculation. Calculated results indicate that the peak temperature in the molten pool is significantly lowered, since a substantial amount of the volatile fission products is released from the molten pool during progression of the accident. The results may directly be applied to the existing severe accident analysis codes to more mechanistically determine the thermal load to the reactor vessel lower head during the in-vessel retention.

The main experimental results in FPTO and FPT1 are first summarized, and the FP release rates measured in both tests are reported and related to degradation events. The interpretation is performed in two steps. First, using general knowledge from the open literature and from previous interpretations of VERCORS analytical experiments, a qualitative description of the possible behaviour of fission gases, Cs, Mo and Ba is given by considering only intact fuel geometry. This interpretation is illustrated by calculations performed with the mechanistic MFPR code. Then, in a second step, possible effects of fuel dissolution, foaming and interactions with structural materials are considered. For FPT1, most of the FP release might be explained by mechanisms acting in intact geometry. On the contrary, for FPTO, it is necessary to consider the fuel dissolution by molten non-oxidised Zr, mainly at grain boundaries to explain the early and large FPs release observed in this test. In addition, it is shown that in both tests, the release from the corium molten pool is not significant and that interactions with Zr and Fe from structural materials can strongly reduce the Ba release.

J	Lee, YS; Ryu, CH; Kim, HS; Choi, YJ				Lee, YS; Ryu, CH; Kim, HS; Choi, YJ			A study on the free drop impact of a cask using commercial FEA codes	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								The package used to transport radioactive materials, which is called a cask, must be designed to keep its contents safe under normal and hypothetical accident conditions. The design requirements of the cask are verified by test or finite element analysis (FEA). Comparing evaluation procedures for the safety of a new cask, the cost of FEA is generally much less than that test. Therefore, FEA is mainly used to verify safety of a cask under the considered conditions. However, one commercial FEA code may show different results from another FEA code for the same problem due to the modeler's several assumptions for simplifying actual states into the FE model and due to modeling technique. Materials of the components of a cask display elastic-plastic or elastic-perfectly plastic behavior under the considered conditions in which large deformation, impact and contact mechanism are included. The behavior is simulated with difficulty and may have different results depending on FEA codes. In this paper, finite element analysis is carried out for the 9-m free drop and the puncture condition under the hypothetical accident condition by using LS-DYNA3D and ABAQUS/Explicit. Energy and effective stress on each component are presented and compared between the two FEA codes, where the effective stress designates the maximum von Mises stress on inner and outer shells.

A major issue for this application is the radiation hardness of such devices. Tests of radiation hardness of CCDs used in the SLD vertex detector, VXD3, have been reported earlier. The first measurements of 1998 involved a spare VXD3 CCD that was irradiated with neutrons from a radioactive source (Pu-Be), and from a nuclear reactor. In 2003, we had the opportunity to disassemble the VXD3 detector and study the nature of the radiation damage it incurred during 3 years of operation at SLC. In the preparation for this study, additional experiments with the spare VXD3 CCD were performed. These included measurements of trapping times in neutron irradiated CCDs. Results, reported here, will help us better understand the mechanism of radiation damage effects and develop techniques to minimize performance degradation due to radiation damage.

J	Hollinger, R; Galonska, M				Hollinger, R; Galonska, M			Status of vacuum arc ion source development for injection of high current uranium ion beams into the GSI accelerator facility	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						ion source; uranium ion beams; vacuum arc; electron and ion energy distribution; emittance; computer simulation	PLASMA; VELOCITIES; REGION; FLUX	To fill up the GSI heavy ion synchrotron (SIS) to its space charge limit with uranium ions, a new vacuum arc ion source (VARIS) based on the MEVVA IV ion source has been developed and implemented into operation. The ion source has proven its capability in several long period beam times at the high current injector at GSI. With the new ion source it was possible to exceed the space charge limit of 15 mA U4+ ions at the entrance of the linear accelerator (UNILAC) for the very first time. The reliability as well as the noise behaviour has been improved to such a degree, that this ion source can be used for injection into an accelerator without objection. In this article we present the improvements of the ion source with the most important operational data. As part of the ion source development the ion and electron energy distributions were measured with an electrostatic cylinder spectrometer device. The energy spectrometer discriminates charged particles with different energy to charge ratio which - in case of different ion species within an extracted beam - allows a charge sensitive evaluation of ion energy distributions. Energy distributions are measured for various discharge parameters, i.e. arc current, magnetic flux densities close to the discharge region, and cathode materials. Different plasma parameters can be derived from these measurements: the anode drop, charge resolved mean energy and the energy spread of ions, mean electron energy and electron temperature. The electron energy may support the development of a plasma model of a vacuum arc plasma consisting of high charge states. Observations of the vacuum are with a digital video camera have been carried out as well as three-dimensional computer simulations for the multi-aperture accel-decel extraction system.

J	Youinou, G; Vasile, A				Youinou, G; Vasile, A			Plutonium multirecycling in standard PWRs loaded with evolutionary fuels	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							WATER REACTORS	If it becomes necessary to stabilize the Pu inventory before the advent of Gen IV fast reactors, then it must be multirecycled in thermal neutron reactors like pressurized water reactors (PWRs). However, because of the neutron physics characteristics of Pu, it is difficult to multirecycle it in mixed-oxide (MOX)-fueled PWRs. Indeed, since there are fewer and fewer fissile isotopes in Pu, it is necessary to compensate by increasing its content, causing it to quickly reach values where the void coefficient is positive (above 12% Pu). To avoid this, Pu must be used together with enriched U so that its degradation is compensated by an increase of U-235 enrichment. Two possibilities of mixing Pu and enriched U in the same assembly are presented (homogeneously and heterogeneously). In the first, called MOX-UE, all the fuel rods are made of PuO2-UenrichedO2, whereas the second, called CORAIL, contains approximately one-third of standard MOX rods (PuO2-UtailO2) and two-thirds of UO2 rods. A variant of the CORAIL concept in which the MOX rods are substituted with inert matrix fuel rods (PuO2-CeO2) was also studied. These assemblies allow Pu to be multirecycled in standard PWRs, thus stabilizing the Pu inventory between 200 and 400 t heavy metal (for a nuclear electricity production of 400 TW(.)h(electric)/yr, i.e., typical of a country such as France). The number of reactors loaded with Pu depends on the performances of each concept in terms of Pu burning, and it represents between 80% (CORAIL with the MOX rods) and 30% (MOX-UE with 12% Pu) of the total power. There is only a small difference regarding the needs in natural U between the Pu monorecycling option and the different Pu multirecycling options. Hence, it appears that saving U should not be offered as an incentive for multirecycling Pu in PWRs.

J	Choi, H; Kim, DH				Choi, H; Kim, DH			Refueling simulation strategy of a CANDU reactor based on optimum zone controller water levels	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							PROGRAM; FUEL	An optimum refueling simulation method was developed for application to a Canada deuterium uranium 713-MW(electric) (CANDU-6) reactor. The objective of the optimization was to maintain the operating range of the zone controller unit (ZCU) water level so that the reference zone power distribution is reproduced following the refueling operation. The zone controller level on the refueling operation was estimated by the generalized perturbation method, which provides sensitivities of the zone power to an individual refueling operation and the zone controller level. By constructing a system equation of the zone power, the zone controller level was obtained, which was used to find the most suitable combination of the refueling channels. The 250-full-power-day refueling simulations showed that the channel and bundle powers are well controlled below the license limits when the ZCU water level remains in the typical operating range.

J	Soler, JM; Mader, UK				Soler, JM; Mader, UK			Interaction between hyperalkaline fluids and rocks hosting repositories for radioactive waste: Reactive transport simulations	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							DIFFUSION; CEMENT; PLUME; CLAY	Reactive transport calculations simulating the interaction between hyperalkaline solutions derived from the degradation of cement and potential host rocks for repositories for low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste have been performed. Two different cases are shown: (a) The example of the planned repository at Wellenberg and (b) the modeling of the GTS-HPF experiment at the Grimsel Test Site. The GIMRT code has been used for the simulations. Mineral reactions are described by kinetic rate laws. The reaction rates for the primary minerals are based on experimentally determined rates published in the literature and geometric considerations combined with measurements regarding mineral surface areas. Relatively fast rates for the secondary minerals have been used, so the results resemble the local equilibrium solution for these minerals. In both cases, the alteration of the rock and the precipitation of secondary phases cause a reduction in the permeability of the system, which would actually be beneficial for the performance of a repository.

J	Shatilla, YA; Loewen, EP				Shatilla, YA; Loewen, EP			A fast-spectrum test reactor concept	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						CANDU; fast test reactor; MCNP		The need for a new steady-state fast-neutron reactor has been the subject of numerous national meetings and discussions. This type of reactor will be able to open new frontiers of research for Generation IV reactors, the Space Propulsion Program, and the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative. With the confluence of these three programs' fast-spectrum testing needs, we set out to conceptualize a new system by looking at previous successful reactor concepts. This paper presents a new concept for a fast-spectrum test reactor that is horizontal in orientation, with individual pressure tubes running the entire length of the scattering-medium tank filled with a liquid heavy metal. This approach for a test reactor will provide more flexibility in refueling, sample removal, and ability to completely reconfigure the core to meet different users' requirements. Full core neutronic analysis of more than 14 combinations showed that a large hexagonal steam-cooled U-10Zr fuel, with a core power of 267 MW(thermal), produced a fast flux (>0.1 MeV) of 1.3 X 10(15) n/cm(2) center dot s averaged over the whole length of the irradiation channel. A depletion run with an initial enrichment of 20 wt% U-235 had a flat reactivity curve for the first 180 days of cycle due to in-core breeding. Although considerable neutronic optimization and a thermal-hydraulic analysis remain to be performed, it appears that a reactor core with this innovative geometry could meet future fast flux testing needs.

However, some studies have been initiated to explore the applicability for simulating a large-break loss-of-coolant accident in CANDU reactors. In the present study, the small-reactor inlet header break test and the steam generator secondary-side depressurization test conducted in the RD-14 test facility were simulated with the RELAP5/ MOD3.2.2 code to examine its extended capability for all the postulated transients and accidents in CANDU reactors. The results were compared with experimental data and those of the CATHENA code performed by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited. In the RELAP5 analyses, the heated sections in the facility were simulated as a multichannel with five pipe models, which have identical flow areas and hydraulic elevations, as well as a single-pipe model. The results of the small-reactor inlet header break and the steam generator secondary-side depressurization simulations predicted experimental data reasonably well. However, some discrepancies in the depressurization of the primary heat transport system after the header break and consequent time delay of the major phenomena were observed in the simulation of the small-reactor inlet header break test.

The method is based on the precipitation of Pu as ammonium plutonium (III)-oxalate and involves the adjustment of acidity of the Pu solution to 1 N, the addition of ascorbic acid (0.05 M) to reduce Pu to Pu(III), followed by the addition of (NH4)(2)SO4 (0.5 M) and a stoichiometric amount of saturated oxalic acid maintaining a 0.2 M excess of oxalic acid concentration in the supernatant. The precipitate was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction and thermal and chemical analysis and was found to have the composition NH4Pu(C2O4)(2)center dot 3H(2)O. This compound can be easily decomposed to PuO2 on heating in air at 823 K. Decontamination factors of U, Fe, and Cr determined showed quantitative removal of these ions during the precipitation of Pu as ammonium plutonium (III)-oxalate. A semiautomatic assembly based on the transfer of solutions by suction arrangement was designed and fabricated for processing large volumes of Pu solution. This assembly reduced the corrosion of the glove-box material and offered the advantage of lower radiation exposure to the working personnel.

J	Sommer, WF; Maloy, SA; Louthan, MR; Willcutt, GJ; Ferguson, PD; James, MR				Sommer, WF; Maloy, SA; Louthan, MR; Willcutt, GJ; Ferguson, PD; James, MR			Performance of a clad tungsten rod spallation neutron source target	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						tungsten; neutron source; irradiation		Tungsten rods, slip-clad with Type 304L stainless steel, performed successfully as a spallation neutron source target operating to a peak fluence of similar to 4 X 10(21) p/cm(2). The target was used as a neutron source during the Accelerator Production of Tritium (APT) materials irradiation program at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center. Tungsten rods of 2.642-mm diameter were slip-fit in Type 304L stainless steel tubes that had an inner diameter of 2.667 mm. The radial gap was filled with helium at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. Los Alamos High Energy Transport (LAHET) calculations suggest a time-averaged peak power deposition in the W of 2.25 kW/cm(3). Thermal-hydraulic calculations indicate that the peak centerline W temperature reached 271 degrees C. The LAHET calculations were also used to predict neutron and proton fluxes and spectra for the complex geometry used in the irradiation program. Activation foil sets distributed throughout the experiment were used to determine target neutronics performance as a comparison to the LAHET calculations. Examination of the irradiated target assemblies revealed no significant surface degradation or corrosion on either the Type 304L or the W surfaces. However, it was clear that the irradiation changed material properties because post-proton-irradiation measurements on Type 304L test samples from the APT program demonstrated increases in the yield strength and decreases in the ductility and fracture toughness with increasing dose, and the wrought W rod samples became brittle. Fortunately, the slip-clad target design subjects the materials to very low stress.

We propose the burning of this thorium dissolved as a fluoride in molten salt in the minimum viscosity mixture of LiF and BeF2 together with a small amount of U-235 or plutonium fluoride to initiate the process to be located at least 10 m underground. The fission products could be stored at the same underground location. With graphite replacement or new cores and with the liquid fuel transferred to the new cores periodically, the power plant could operate for up to 200 yr with no transport of fissile material to the reactor or of wastes from the reactor during this period. Advantages that include utilization of an abundant fuel, inaccessibility of that fuel to terrorists or for diversion to weapons use, together with good economics and safety features such as an underground location will diminish public concerns. We call for the construction of,a small prototype thorium-burning reactor.

Some parts of the FE-SEM were modified for the remote handling outside the cell. The energy dispersive spectrometer modified for the samples was also equipped on the FE-SEM to determine element compositions of the observed samples. After the modifications, characterization tests were carried out using deposited gold film and uranium rock samples that were unirradiated. In results of the tests, high-resolution images of those specimens were obtained with high magnification above 10000. From those results, it was expected that the FE-SEM kept the high performance even after the modifications and would be utilized for radioactive samples.

The possible transmutation of minor actinides of spent nuclear fuel in the helium-cooled ceramic blanket is examined. The reactor tritium breeding ratio, reaction rates and heat deposition in the module materials were analysed. These values were estimated as a function of the fuel element diameter with neptunium, the number of fuel elements in the cassette, and the presence or absence of a moderator around the cassettes. A three-dimensional Monte Carlo calculation using the MCNP code was performed for the full heterogeneous model of the blanket and fuel assemblies. After six years of reactor operation, for the cassette containing 19 fuel elements with NpN, 82% of the neptunium burnt out in the case of the water-cooled cassette and 72% in the case of the lead-cooled cassette. This corresponds to a transmutation of similar to 100 kg neptunium in one module.

It is shown that the breeding of fissible materials in liquid-salt reactors can be achieved without cleaning if a technique of dynamic loading with core superposition is used. The paper presents a diagram of the fuel circuit of such a reactor and the design of the fuel channel. Heavy water is used as a moderator, and heavy water with graphite are used as a reflector in this reactor. Infrequent fuel cleaning, i.e. partial removal of the fission products, makes it possible to considerably improve the fuel breeding while keeping additional costs at an acceptable level. The tritium produced in the liquid-salt reactor can be effectively used in a thermonuclear reactor (tokamak) to produce uranium-233 from thorium. This can help in the treatment of an ecologically hazardous substance (tritium) and enhance the breeding of fissible materials in the major fission reactor.

J	Lee, MH; Douglas, M; Clark, SB				Lee, MH; Douglas, M; Clark, SB			Development of in situ fission track analysis for detecting fissile nuclides in contaminated solid particles	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article						fission track analysis; fissile nuclides; solid particles	SOIL SAMPLES; URANIUM	A fission track analysis (FIFA) technique was developed to identify hot particles in a contaminated soil or sediment. To identify the location of fissile particles in a contaminated sample, SEM grids electroplated with U or Th were used to record reference points on the Lexan track detector. The track image of the grid coated with Th, as a result of the Th-232 (fast neutron, f) reaction, was recorded clearly on the Lexan track detector whereas the track images of the grid coated with U were too dense to be used for FIFA. The grid coated with thorium can provide more useful information on locating fissionable nuclides such as uranium and plutonium isotopes in contaminated sample material. FrA with grids electroplated with Th was applied to contaminated soil so that hot particles in the soil were identified within the finder grid and could be separated from the sample matrix for studying speciation of hot particles.

The values ranged from 62 nGy h(-1) at Dois Rios Beach to 126 nGy h(-1) at Preta Beach. The activity concentrations of radionuclides Th-232 series, U-238 series and K-40 in three different sand profiles (0-10, 10-20 and 20-30cm) were measured using gamma ray spectrometry and the result is shown in Bqkg(-1). In most of the cases, eight out of ten beaches, K-40 was the main contributor to the calculated local gamma dose rate. The annual effective doses were 0.15 +/- 0.03 mSv yr(-1) for Preta and 0.10 +/- 0.02 mSv yr(-1) for Caxadaco beaches, while in the others beaches the mean value of annual effective doses was 0.08 mSv yr(-1). None of the beaches analysed were considered a radiological risk. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The K content of individual grains is 13-14%. The U, Th and Rb contents are sufficiently high to make significant contributions to the internal dose rate compared to the contribution from the K content. The U and Th contents are reduced, but not eliminated completely, by hydrofluoric (HF) acid etching. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The concentrations of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 in the selected building materials ranges from 19.5 to 68.3Bq kg(-1), 13.4 to 51.7 Bq kg(-1) and 63.2 to 713.9 Bq kg(-1), respectively. The measured activity concentrations for these natural radionuclides were compared with the reported data of other countries and with the world average activity of soil. The radium equivalent activities (Ra-eq), external hazard index (H-ex) and the internal radiation hazard index (H-in) associated with the natural radionuclides were calculated. The Raeq values of all building materials are lower than the limit of 370 Bq kg(-1), equivalent to a gamma-dose of 1.5 mSv yr(-1). The values of H-ex and H-in are less than unity.

J	Vargas, MJ; Timon, AF				Vargas, MJ; Timon, AF			Dependence of self-absorption on thickness for thin and thick alpha-particle sources of UO2	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						self-absorption; ion interactions in matter; alpha-particle spectrometry; Monte Carlo methods	2-PI GEOMETRY; BACKSCATTERING; SIMULATION; EMITTERS	Activity measurements of alpha-particle sources with significant thicknesses require corrections for the self-absorption of alpha particles in the source. The dependence of the self-absorption coefficient on source mass varies according to the chemical composition of the substrate, and is often obtained empirically by measuring a great number of sources with known activity and different thicknesses. In the present work, we use Monte Carlo simulation for this task, applying the computer code SRIM, developed to simulate the transport of ions in matter, to the determination of the self-absorption coefficients for alpha-particle sources measured in detectors with a 2 pi counting geometry. In particular, the coefficients were calculated for sources of uranium dioxide containing U-235, with a wide range of source thicknesses: from 1.0 to 10 mg/cm(2) (thin sources, with thicknesses smaller than the range of alpha particles) and from 11 to 30 mg/cm(2) (to cover self-absorption in thick sources). The behaviour obtained for the dependence of self-absorption on thickness for these two thickness regions was compared with a simple theoretical model. The simulation results were in good agreement with the model, although there were some discrepancies for thin sources, which can be explained by taking into consideration the scattering of alpha particles in the source. The present work shows the utility of using the Monte Carlo code SRIM to evaluate the self-absorption corrections needed in the measurement of alpha-particle sources. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The detector consists of a pair of LSO scintillators, optical fibers, a pair of photo-multiplier tubes (PMTs), and a coincidence circuit. Because the LSO scintillators are located on the tips of tweezers, a target organ such as a lymph node or the colon can be positioned between them. The size of a single LSO was 3.7 mm x 3.7 mm x 10 mm, and the scintillation photons are transferred to the PMTs via 2-mm-diameter, 1-m long optical fibers. The results show that the light loss due to the fiber was significant but there was sufficient light to observe the photo-peak of the 511-keV gamma photons. Sensitivity response function perpendicular to the detector has a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 2.5 mm, while that parallel to the detector has a FWHM of 5.5 mm. Background counts due to the natural radioisotope in Lu-176 can be observed when the distance between these two scintillators is small. Results also show that the absolute sensitivity was 0.057% at the center of the detector when the two LSOs were 10mm apart and that the optical fiber was insensitive to bending up to a radius of 10 cm. From these results, we conclude that the proposed tweezers-type coincidence detector could be some interest for tumor detection using FDG, such as that in radio-guided surgery. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The catalytic rate constants of two types of hydrophobic catalysts were measured at a 100% relative humidity. The catalytic rate constants were measured at 60 degrees C for 28 days and both the catalysts showed very high initial catalytic rate constants. The measured deactivation profile showed that the catalytic rate constants of both the catalysts were almost identical for 28 days. The deactivation of the catalysts was modelled based upon the time-on-stream theory. The deactivation profiles of the catalysts were estimated by using the model for a period of three years. The results showed that both the catalysts had a good exchange capacity for hydrogen isotopes and they could be applicable to a tritium removal facility that will be built at the Wolsong nuclear power plants in the near future.

If Ca2+ channels in cell membrane are blocked by medicines or other substances with considerable calcium antagonistic effects, these diseases might be cured or controlled. The influence of some Chinese crude drugs, including Crocus sativus, Carthamus tinctorius, Ginkgo biloba and Bulbus allii macrostemi on Ca2+ influx in isolated rat aortas was investigated by using Ca-45 as a radioactive tracer, and their calcium antagonistic effects were evaluated. It can be noted that Ca2+ uptake in isolated rat aorta rings in normal physiological status was not markedly altered by these drugs, whereas the Ca2+ influxes induced by norepinephrine of 1.2 mu mo1/L and KCl of 100 mmol/L were significantly inhibited by Crocus, Carthamus and Bulbus in a concentration-dependent manner, but not by Ginkgo. The results show that extracellular Ca2+ influx through receptor-operated Ca2+ channels and potential-dependent Ca2+ channels can be blocked by Crocus, Carthamus and Bulbus. This implies that these Chinese crude drugs have obvious calcium antagonistic effects. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Today, new isotopes for diagnostic and therapeutic uses are not being developed, critical isotopes for national security are in short supply, and demand for isotopes critical to homeland security exceeds supply. While commercial suppliers, both domestic and foreign, can only meet specific needs, the nation needs a consistent, reliable supply of radioactive and stable isotopes for research, medical, security, and space power applications. The national isotope infrastructure, defined as both facilities and trained staff at national laboratories and universities, is in danger of being lost due to chronic underfunding. With the specific recommendations given herein, the US Department of Energy may realign and refocus its Isotope Program to provide a framework for a successful National Isotope Program.
