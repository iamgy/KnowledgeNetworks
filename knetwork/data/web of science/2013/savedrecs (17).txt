The complexaton of UO2Cl42- in binary mixtures of LiCl-KCl, LiCl-RbCl, and LiCl-CsCl was investigated. The spectrum of UO2Cl42- obtained was characterized by Raman active vibration modes, that is, totally symmetric stretching vibrations A(1g) (v(1): OUO) and A(1g) (v(2): UCl4), and bending vibration E-g (v(8:) UO2Cl2). The dependence of polarizing power of solvent cations on the vibrational frequencies was clarified. The vs frequencies were insensitive to the change in the polarizing power. On the other hand, the v(1) and v(2) frequencies increased with the rise of polarizing power. The Raman shifts suggest that the square bipyramidal structure of UO2Cl42- is kept in various binary alkali chlorides, while O2- and Cl- around U(VI) are clearly polarized by the increase of polarizing power.

In the NEMD simulation, the thermal conductivity was determined by the temperature gradient and heat flux using Fourier's law. The calculated thermal conductivity decreased with increasing temperature and defect concentration i.e. excess oxygen and oxygen vacancy concentrations. The calculated thermal conductivity decreased with increase of the deviation x from stoichiometry and number of defects. By comparing the hyperstoichiometric and hypostoichiometriC oxides, it was found that the effect of Pu3+ and oxygen vacancy on the thermal conductivity was larger than that of U5+ and excess oxygen. Further, the cuboctahedral defect clusters were observed in the hyperstoichiometric UO2+x supercell. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thermal hydraulic analysis of the AHWR-The Indian thorium fuelled innovative nuclear reactor	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								Analysis has been carried out for simulating loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) at inlet header in a natural circulation type reactor developed as the advanced heavy water reactor (AHWR). The paper will cover a case of LOCA due to 200% break at inlet header which is double ended rupture. The maximum clad surface temperature has been predicted in different cases by using the thermal hydraulic safety code RELAP5/Mod4.0. The proposed reactor is a 920 MWth vertical pressure tube type, boiling light water cooled and heavy water moderated reactor. One of the important passive design features of this reactor is heat removal through natural circulation of primary coolant (at all allowed power levels) with no primary coolant pumps. This reactor is equipped with emergency core cooling system (ECCS) and isolation condensers (ICs) to remove decay heat during LOCA. This ECCS provides cooling to fuel in passive mode during first fifteen minutes of LOCA and it is achieved by high pressure injection from advanced accumulator. Cooling is continued for Later for three days by the gravity driven water pool (GDWP). This paper investigates the impact of high pressure injection in this cooling process. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

CATHARE2 V25 code (Code for Analysis of Thermal-Hydraulics during an Accident of Reactor and Safety Evaluation) is used. CATHARE is developed by the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) and owned in partnership with three other French partners: EDF, AREVA-ANP and IRSN. The radio-chemical components in CATHARE2 include, besides activation products, four fission products with predefined characteristics (Kr-87, Xe-133,1-131, Cs-137). New radioactive species can be defined by the user, and the characteristics of the existing ones can be modified. The TRIGA model created comprises both the primary reactor circuit and reactor hall, involving water zones and non-condensable gas (air). Ventilation system is simulated by means of boundary conditions. Using the same facility model, two separate studies are performed with externally calculated sources: fission product species transport and evacuation. This is done as PSA support studies, postulating core damage and volatile species release; Ar-41 transport and evacuation. Argon activity at reactor stack is calculated for normal operation and compared to monitor readings. The paper describes also the calculation of the radioactive sources based on SCALE 4.4 in case of fission products, and using MCNP5 for Ar-41. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Investigation of dry out of SFP for VVER440/V230 at Kozloduy NPP	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Review								This paper presents the thermal-hydraulic investigation of spent fuel behavior during its transferring from reactor vessel through refueling cavity (RC) to spent fuel pool (SFP) in case of dry out for VVER440/V230 units 3 and 4 at Kozloduy NPP. The fuel transfer canal connects the refueling cavity and spent fuel pool and this way set up a command pool. The presented analysis has been performed up to the moment of fuel heat up in case of spent fuel pool (SFP) dry out during the first stage of refueling activities. The main feature during this stage is: the maximum decay power of "new" spent fuel; the "new" spent fuel is still in the reactor vessel; the fuel transfer canal connects the refueling cavity and spent fuel pool. In this way the coolant have maximum volume and the spent fuel with maximum decay power is still in the reactor vessel. The "old" spent fuel in SFP has significantly low decay power. The main purpose of this analysis is to estimate the time for dry out of SFP, heat up of spent fuel and time for recovery actions from the operators. In the performed analysis are defined the following stages during the accident. Termination of natural circulation after decreasing of water level in reactor vessel below the hot nozzles. Beginning of coolant heat up in the reactor core. Reaching the temperature of saturation at the outlet of the assembly. Startup of the reactor core uncover. Loss of critical safety functions. The analysis has been performed with the thermal-hydraulic computer code RELAP5/MOD3.2. The RELAP5/MOD3.2 model for Kozloduy NPP VVER-440 have been developed and validated at the Institute for Nuclear Research and Nuclear Energy - Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (INRNE-BAS) Sofia.

Comparison of HEU and LEU neutron spectra in irradiation facilities at the Oregon State TRIGA (R) Reactor	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							FUEL	In 2008, the Oregon State TRIGA (R) Reactor (OSTR) was converted from highly enriched uranium (HEU) fuel lifetime improvement plan (FLIP) fuel to low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel. This effort was driven and supported by the Department of Energy's (DoE's) Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactors (RERTR) program. The basis behind the RERTR program's ongoing conversion effort is to reduce the nuclear proliferation risk of civilian research and test reactors. The original intent of the HEU FLIP fuel was to provide fuel to research reactors that could be utilized for many years before a necessary refueling cycle. As a research reactor, the OSTR provides irradiation facilities for a variety of applications, such as activation analysis, fission-track dating, commercial isotope production, neutron radiography, prompt gamma characterization, and many others. In order to accurately perform these research functions, several studies had been conducted on the HEU FLIP fuel core to characterize the neutron spectra in various experimental facilities of the OSTR (Tiyapun, 1997; Ashbaker, 2005). As useful as these analyses were, they are no longer valid due to the change in fuel composition and the resulting alteration of core performance characteristics. Additionally, the core configuration (fuel reconfiguration) was altered between the HEU and LEU cores. This study characterizes the neutron spectra in various experimental facilities within and around the current LEU core. It also compares the spectra to that which was yielded in the HEU core through use of Monte Carlo n-Particle 5 (MCNP5) and experimental adjustment via a least-squares technique.

Autonomous dynamic decision making in a nuclear fuel cycle simulator	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								Growing energy demand and the push to move toward carbon-free ways of electricity generation have renewed the world's interest in nuclear energy. Due to the high technical and economic uncertainties related to nuclear energy, simulation tools have become a necessity in order to plan and evaluate possible nuclear fuel cycles (NFCs). Most of the NFC simulators today work by running the simulation with a user-defined set of facility build orders and preferences. While this allows for a simple way to change the simulation conditions, it may not always lead to optimal results and strongly relies on the user defining the correct parameters. This study looks into the possibility of using the expected cost of electricity (CoE) as the driving build decision variable instead of relying on user-defined build orders. This is a first step toward a more general decision making strategy in dynamic fuel cycle simulation. For this purpose, additional modules were implemented in an NFC simulator, VEGAS, with the consumption dependent price of uranium as a time-varying NFC cost component that drives the cost competitiveness of available NFC options. The model was demonstrated to verify the correct operation of a CoE-driven NFC simulator. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These fission products escape into the environment to contribute in accident source term. The mitigation in environmental release is demanded for such radiological consequences. Thus, countermeasures to source term, mitigations of release of radioactivity have been studied for 1000 MWe PWR reactor. The procedure of study is divided into five steps: (1) calculation and verification of core inventory, evaluated by BURN-UP code, (2) containment modeling based on radioactivity removal factors, (3) selection of potential accidents initiates the severe accident, (4) calculation of release of radioactivity, (5) study the dependency of release of radioactivity on containment engineering safety features (ESFs) inducing mitigation. Loss of coolant accident (LOCA), small break LOCA and flow blockage accidents (FBA) are selected as initiating accidents. The mitigation effect of ESFs on source term has been studied against ESFs performance. Parametric study of release of radioactivity has been carried out by modeling and simulating the containment parameters in MATLAB, which takes BURN-UP outcomes as input along with the probabilistic data. The dependency of iodine and aerosol source term on boric and caustic acid spray has been determined. The variation in source term mitigation with the variation of containment spray flow rate and pH values have been studied. The variation in containment retention factor (CRF) has also been studied with the ESF performance. A rapid decrease in source term is observed with the increase in pH value. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Comparison for thorium fuel cycle facilities of two different capacities for implementation of safeguards	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							REACTORS	Thorium based nuclear fuel cycle has many attractive features, its inherent proliferation resistance being one of them. This is due to the presence of high energy gamma emitting daughter products of U-232 associated with U-233. This high energy gamma radiation also poses challenges in nuclear material accounting. A typical thorium fuel cycle facility has a number of plants including a fuel fabrication plant for initial and equilibrium core, a reprocessed U-233 fuel fabrication plant, a reprocessing plant, a fuel assembly/disassembly plant and associated waste handling and management plants. A thorium fuel cycle facility can be set up to serve reactors at a site. Alternatively, one can follow a hub and spoke approach with a large thorium fuel cycle facility acting as a hub, catering to the requirements of reactors at several sites as spokes. These two concepts have their respective merits and shortcomings in terms of engineering and economics. The present paper is aimed at comparing the merits and challenges for implementation of safeguards on the two concepts viz, a large fuel cycle hub catering to reactors at several sites versus a small fuel cycle facility dedicated to reactors at a single site.

J	Shorman, M				Shorman, Malek			Estimating the risk of cancer and the hazardous index due to radiation from the phosphate mine in Russifa area	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								Phosphate mines are considered prone to high radioactivity. The Russifa area contains one of the largest phosphate mines in Jordan. The hazardous index is high at 1.503 and 1.24, while the radium equivalent activity concentrations were 556.9 and 459.9 for phosphate pile and zoo, respectively. These values exceed the permissible levels in residential areas. The annual radiation doses at the site equals 36.4 and 30.1 mSv for the phosphate pile and zoo, respectively and these values pose a significant risk on the nearby population. Cancer risk is high in all body tissues, especially in the colon for both males and females. It is therefore imperative that these sites be rehabilitated and with a priority objective to reduce the annual dose rate to permissible levels and consequently the risk of cancer.

A Bayesian analysis of uncertainties on lung doses resulting from occupational exposures to uranium	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							INTERNAL DOSIMETRY; MONODISPERSE; CLEARANCE; PARTICLES; VALUES	In a recent epidemiological study, Bayesian estimates of lung doses were calculated in order to determine a possible association between lung dose and lung cancer incidence resulting from occupational exposures to uranium. These calculations, which produce probability distributions of doses, used the human respiratory tract model (HRTM) published by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) with a revised particle transport clearance model. In addition to the Bayesian analyses, point estimates (PEs) of doses were also provided for that study using the existing HRTM as it is described in ICRP Publication 66. The PEs are to be used in a preliminary analysis of risk. To explain the differences between the PEs and Bayesian analysis, in this paper the methodology was applied to former UK nuclear workers who constituted a subset of the study cohort. The resulting probability distributions of lung doses calculated using the Bayesian methodology were compared with the PEs obtained for each worker. Mean posterior lung doses were on average 8-fold higher than PEs and the uncertainties on doses varied over a wide range, being greater than two orders of magnitude for some lung tissues. It is shown that it is the prior distributions of the parameters describing absorption from the lungs to blood that are responsible for the large difference between posterior mean doses and PEs. Furthermore, it is the large prior uncertainties on these parameters that are mainly responsible for the large uncertainties on lung doses. It is concluded that accurate determination of the chemical form of inhaled uranium, as well as the absorption parameter values for these materials, is important for obtaining unbiased estimates of lung doses from occupational exposures to uranium for epidemiological studies. Finally, it should be noted that the inferences regarding the PEs described here apply only to the assessments of cases provided for the epidemiological study, where central estimates of dose were sought. Approved dosimetry service assessments of exposures are unlikely to yield significant underestimates, as pessimistic assumptions of lung solubility would almost always be used.

Fate of radionuclides present in Indian fly ashes on its application as soil ameliorant	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							COAL POWER-PLANTS; NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; TRACE-ELEMENTS; CROP PRODUCTIVITY; SAMPLES; RADIATION; PAKISTAN; LIGNITE; IMPACT; ROCKS	Natural radioactivity depends primarily on the geological and geographical conditions, and appears at different levels in the soils. Coal contains various organic and inorganic substances including trace quantities of the naturally occurring radionuclides, which are of human health concern. The combustion of coals releases natural radioactive elements in the form of their oxides to the environment. In view of the current researches on fly ash (FA) applications as soil ameliorants, the present study deals with the presence of the natural radionuclides (Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40) in the coal ash and their mobilisation through the amendment of coal ash to the soil and crop produce. The study shows the variation in the content of radionuclides in soil, FA and crop produce depending on types of soil and FA, mobilisation of the radionuclides from soil/FA to the plant and interactions between radionuclides and soil, etc. The content of the radionuclides in the soil, FA and crop produce is within the permissible limits.

The samples were collected at an average altitude of 2293 m above sea level in Central Karakoram. The activity concentration data were analysed by principal component analysis for outlier detection and data structure elucidation and for frequency distributions. The median activity concentrations of Ra-226, Th-232, K-40 and Cs-137 were found to be 49.812.6, 80.918.7, 97791 and 4.374.08 Bq kg(1), respectively. An uncertainty analysis showed that the main contribution to uncertainty budget was from the counting statistics and uncertainty in the reference activity of standard. The activity concentration data showed a positive significant correlation between Ra-226 and Th-232. Three hazard indices named the radium equivalent activity, external hazard index and internal hazard index were calculated. In the total activity concentration, K-40 accounted for the most (87.5 ), whilst in the radium equivalent activity, Th-232 contributed the most (48.5 ). In the Skardu samples, the air-absorbed dose rate was found to be 11217 nGy h(1), annual effective dose rate from terrestrial to be 24338 Sv y(1), effective dose rate due to the deposition of Cs-137 on soil to be 1.12.4 Sv y(1) and dose rate from the cosmic radiations to be 1371107 Sv y(1). The ratio of mass fractions of Th/U was 4.80.6.The results were compared with the similar measurements made in other parts of the world. A comparison with the other cities of Pakistan revealed that the soil in Skardu presented the highest external exposure rate.

J	Uosif, MAM				Uosif, M. A. M.			Quantitative measurement of natural radioactivity in some roofing tile materials used in upper Egypt	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							BUILDING-MATERIALS; RADIATION HAZARDS; STATE	The quantitative measurement of radionuclides (Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40) in some roofing tile materials (granite, alabaster, marble, traditional and advanced ceramic) used in Upper Egypt is presented in this paper. Measurements were done by using gamma spectrometry (NaI (Tl) 3 ' 3 '). The values of concentration of natural radionuclides were in the following ranges: 1278.9 Bq kg(1) for Ra-226, 8.4113.1 Bq kg(1) for Th-232 and 94.9509 Bq kg(1)for K-40. The activity concentration index (I), the specific dose rates indoors (D) and the annual effective dose (D-E) due to gamma radiation were calculated for each investigated sample. The lowest value of I is 0.19 for alabaster, while the highest one is 0.88 for traditional and advanced ceramic. The ranges of D-E are between 0.03 and 0.13 mSv, it is below the maximal permitted values, so that the examined materials could be used as roofing tiles in the construction of new buildings.

Radioactive concentrations were measured by a high purity germanium detector. Five radionuclides including Te-129m, Te-132, I-131, Cs-134 and Cs-137 were detected. The fission product concentration of the dead-leaves was higher than those of the green-leaves in many cases. The highest concentration observed was found on the dead-leaves collected at Iwaki, 60 km far from Fukushima Daiichi. A total activity of 2,000 Bq g(-1) was measured for all 5 radionuclides. Clear images of radioactivity of the highly contaminated leaves were obtained with an imaging plate (IP) after < 24 h exposure time without using a shielded box. The photostimulated luminescence values (PSL) of leaves arranged on half size of IP were roughly in proportion to their activities except for the low activity samples. Semi-quantitative analysis was possible by using PSL values with a large region of interest of half size of IP, because the radioactivity released in the case of the nuclear power plant accident was uniform in the early days.

Statistical techniques, such as cluster analysis, can provide a powerful tool for analyzing water chemistry data. This method is used to test water quality data and determine if samples can be grouped into distinct populations that may be significant in the geologic context, as well as from a statistical point of view. Multivariate statistical analysis method is applied to the geochemical data in combination with delta O-18 and delta H-2 isotopes with the objective to understand the dynamics of groundwater using hierarchical clustering and isotope analyses. The geochemical and isotope data of the central and southern rift valley lakes have been collected and analyzed from different works. Isotope analysis shows that most springs and boreholes are recharged by July and August rainfalls. The different hydrochemical groups that resulted from the multivariate analysis are described and correlated with the geology of the area and whether it has any interaction with a system or not.

Use of isotope hydrology for groundwater resources study in Upper Chi river basin	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Upper Chi river basin; Isotope; Groundwater; Hydrology; Hydrogeology		The Upper Chi river basin is located in the vicinity of Chaiyaphum province, northeastern Thailand. Groundwater management in the drought affected area of fractured Mesozoic siliciclastic rocks groundwater system was challenged by the approaches of isotope and chemical techniques. The local meteoric water line (LMWL) of the study area provide lower slope (delta D = 6.8508 delta O-18 - 0.8013) and more depleted average annual rainfall (delta O-18 = -7.6 %omicron) when compare to LMWL of Bangkok due to higher evaporation. The surface water mainly exhibits an evaporation effect and can be clearly divided into two groups, the upper reaches and the downstream areas, with approximate separated in delta O-18 by -4.0 %omicron. The groundwater system in the area can be divided into seven subareas based on the stable isotope characteristics and groundwater dating by radiocarbon and tritium methods. Nong Bua Deang subarea, Kang Kro subarea, and Thep Satit subarea, the most upstream system which were separated by thick aquitards of Phra Wihan sandstones, are classified as the upper reach area. The groundwater samples are characterized in two traits: the upstream group shows older groundwater ages (< 80.0 % modern carbon, PMC) because of less interaction with surface water and the downstream group, near main channels and reservoirs, exhibit younger groundwater ages because of contribution of surface water in the recharge area. Bamnet Narong subarea and Muang Chaiyaphum subarea are classified as the middle reach area. The groundwater shows rapidly recharge from rainfall, the results of radiocarbon provide younger ages. The downstream characteristic which is closely interaction of extremely evaporated surface, were found in Kon Sawan-Mancha Kiri subarea and Ban Phai subarea. Almost all the groundwater samples are related to younger ages except the wells near the upper tributaries. The groundwater management can be proposed by attending to conservation policy in the upper reach area, and some parts of Ban Phai subarea in which groundwater is slowly replenished slowly, as well as groundwater exploration will be expanded in the Bamnet Narong subarea and the Muang Chaiyaphum subarea which is the most effective zones for groundwater developments.

The study on radioactive contamination in foodstuffs imported from Japan after the Fukushima accident	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Radioactive contamination in food; Fukushima nuclear accident; I-131; Cs-134; Cs-137; Gamma spectroscopy		During the Fukushima nuclear accident, a large number of radionuclides were released, causing direct radioactive contamination to the environment and the ecosystem, and eventually indirect contamination to the foodstuffs. The Radiation Monitoring Group, Office of Atoms for Peace (OAP) in cooperation with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has been monitoring the foodstuffs imported from Japan, especially the Fukushima and nearby areas. This monitoring program covered the potentially contaminated foodstuffs. The measurements were mainly conducted using Gamma spectroscopy systems in order to analyze the radioactive concentration of I-131, Cs-134, and Cs-137 fission products. From 442 samples collected between after the nuclear accident to the end of September 2012, 28 of contaminated food products of fission isotopes have been found with the contamination ranges of 0.63-15.25 Bq/kg fresh, 1.45-44.70 Bq/kg fresh, and 0.45-51.10 Bq/kg fresh) for I-131, Cs-134, and Cs-137, respectively. However, the contamination levels are still well under the Thailand standard of food contaminated with radionuclide and the relevant international standards. Finally, the research also investigated the relationship between the times the samples were collected and the contamination levels.

Evolution of radiocaesium contamination in mushrooms and influence of treatment after collection	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Radiocaesium; Fungi; Mushrooms; Extraction of radiocaesium; Evolution of contamination	RADIOACTIVE CESIUM; CS-137; JAPAN; K-40	In literature quite a lot of data is available on uptake of radioactive caesium in mushrooms. There is less available on the evolution of concentration in fruitbodies after several years and on "outbound" transfer of radiocaesium from fruitbodies to their direct environment, i.e. dilution according to cooking techniques. The recent event at Fukushima has put the question of radionuclides in food, and the following exposure of consumers, high on the agenda. The purpose of this paper is twofold: (1) in order to investigate the variation in time of caesium uptake by fungi, analyses of the same species having grown on the same spot at different intervals during the last 25 years have been performed and (2) in terms of radiation protection the most important thing is the activity taken in by the consumer and not the contamination of raw products. Preparation can have a great impact on activity concentration. Various species of mushrooms frequently eaten have been sampled in Europe and contaminated areas in Japan. Different preparation techniques that can break the walls of the hyphae (drying, deepfreezing etc.) have been applied as well as different treatments: boiling or macerating in water with salt, in acid and basic media. The pH of different media was adjusted and measured. The samples and the medium were analysed separately in gamma spectrometry.

Environmental dose assessment using Ecolego: case study of soil from Japan	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Ecolego; The Fukushima Daiich nuclear power plant accident; Terrestrial food chain; Contaminated soil; Imported food from Japan; Namie; Iitate		From the Fukushima incident, a number of radionuclides were released, causing radioactive contamination to the environment. Depending on their own half-lives, the radionuclides, however, will decay over time. During the decay, those radionuclides can be transferred to the ecosystem and, eventually, to humans. As part of the environmental surveillance and restoration program, radiological dose assessments have been carried out in response to the incident to prevent a potentially unacceptable dose to the public. This study focuses on the deposition of certain radionuclides in soil and their transport through the terrestrial food chain. Soil from two sites, Namie and Iitate, where radioactive contamination is evident was used as the source term. The assessment has been conducted using Ecolego, a simulation software used for conducting dose assessments of complex dynamic systems evolving over time especially in the field of radiology. Possible pathways from the soil used as the source term to humans as well as crops, forage, livestock products, and milk, for specific radioactive species have been studied. The dose assessment results of I-131, Cs-134, Cs-137, Sr-89, and Sr-90 in each compartment of the food chain are presented in this literature. The concentrations of the studied radionuclides vary from one medium to another, resulting from the characteristic of the medium itself along with other factors, such as the half-lives and transfer factors. Due to the fact that the concentrations of the radionuclides are affected by the depth of soil, there may be some uncertainty of the dose assessment results from the model.

Gamma-ray (gamma-ray) spectra measured using a low background HPGe spectrometer showed clear evidence of fission products-I-131, Cs-137, and Cs-134. The I-131 was observed on March 27 and April 8, while Cs-137 and Cs-134 were observed on March 27, April 18, and April 22. The I-131, Cs-137, and Cs-134 activity concentrations in rainwater collected in Hiroshima reached 0.44 +/- A 0.09 on April 8, 0.17 +/- A 0.01 on April 18, and 0.15 +/- A 0.01 Bq/L on April 18, 2011, respectively. These activity levels were compared with global results collected from the Northern Hemisphere. Several samples of rainwater that were collected in Chiba (Kashiwa) on March 21, April 11, and May 12; Tokyo (Nerima) on March 21 and April 11; Osaka (Hirano) on April 8; Nara (Kitakatsuragi) on April 9; and Fukushima (Fukushima) on April 19, were also measured by our spectrometer and compared. Among these samples of rainwater collected at different locations in Japan, the one collected at Kashiwa City, Chiba Prefecture, on March 21 showed the highest activity concentrations of 6072 +/- A 1, 632 +/- A 4, 766 +/- A 3, 637 +/- A 1, 97.6 +/- A 0.8, and 752 +/- A 2 Bq/L for I-131, I-132, Te-132, Cs-134, Cs-136, and Cs-137, respectively. The health risks due to these high activity levels were considered in terms of several regulations. The ratio of the activites for the isotopes I-131 to Cs-137 and Cs-134 to Cs-137 were compared with the other measurements and discussed.

Ion irradiation-induced microstructural evolution was examined by using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD). A complete phase transformation from ordered rhombohedral to disordered fluorite (O-D) was observed by a fluence of 1 x 10(15) ions/cm(2), equivalent to a peak ballistic damage dose of similar to 3.49 displacements per atom (dpa). To research the different irradiation effect between light ion and heavy ion on delta-Lu4Hf3O12, 400 keV Ne2+ ions were implanted to ion fluences ranging from 1 x 10(14) to 1 x 10(15) ions/cm(2). A complete O-D crystal structure transformation was observed by a fluence of 5 x 10(14) ions/cm(2) (similar to 0.22 dpa). This threshold dose was found to be observably lower than the threshold dose to produce order-to-disorder transformation using Xe26+ ions on delta-Lu4Hf3O12. This suggests that heavy ions are less efficient than light ions in producing the retained defects that are responsible for the O-D transformation. The theoretical calculations show that the O-D transformation of delta-phase was attributed to the anion oxygen Frenkel pair defect. The ion irradiation-induced transformation of delta-phase Lu4Hf3O12 into disordered fluorite structure observed here is also discussed in relation to the temperature-composition (T-C) phase diagrams for the compound.

The process consists of solvent extraction of predictable quantity of Sr-90 into an organic solvent containing di-tert-butyl-cyclohexano-18-crown-6 (DCH18C6), formation of a polymeric solution of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), pouring the Sr-90-embedded polymer solution over a surface of a defined area followed by evaporation to create a thin film and peeling-off of the radioactive PMMA film. Quality control tests of the radioactive films were carried out to ensure nonleachability, uniform distribution of activity and stability. Sources having 5 kBq +/- 428 Bq were prepared using this method and routinely used for calibration of contamination monitors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using a reliable method to determine the contamination depth is indispensable prior to the start of decontamination works and also for minimizing the radioactive waste volume and the total workload. The method described in this paper is based on geostatistical modeling of in situ gamma-ray spectroscopy measurements using the multiple photo peak method. The method has been tested on the floor of the waste gas surge tank room within the BR3 (Belgian Reactor 3) decommissioning project and has delivered adequate results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A simple chromatographic method using a SnO2 column was employed to separate Ge-68 from the target material and the co-produced non-isotopic radioisotope impurities. Ge-68 retained in the column served as the Ge-68/Ga-68 generator. Elution efficiency of the column was about 60%. First 2 ml of the eluate contained more than 95% of the elutable activity. Postelution purification cum concentration was done with a small cation exchange resin column. The presence of the inactive tin ions in the Ga-68 eluate was determined by the ICP-OES technique and was found to be about 0.03 ppm. Radiochemical purity of the final Ga-68 preparation was more than 99.99% and it was found to be suitable for making complex with ethylenediamine-N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(methylene phosphonic acid) (EDTMP).

J	Mosorov, V				Mosorov, Volodymyr			An iterative position reconstruction algorithm for radioactive particle techniques	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Non-invasive technique; Iteration procedure; Reconstruction algorithm; Radioactive isotope	MULTIPHASE REACTORS; TRACKING	The Computer Automated Radioactive Particle Tracking (CARPT) technique is widely used to monitor the motion of the flow inside a reactor. Usually a single radioactive particle that is neutrally buoyant with respect to the phase is used as a tracker. The particle moves inside the volume of interest and its positions are determined by an array of scintillation detectors counting incoming photons. Well-known reconstruction algorithms have been traditionally used to map measured counts into the particle position coordinates by solving a minimisation problem between measured events and calibration data. However, these algorithms have serious drawbacks. Their accuracy is determined by resolution of a calibration grid, which results in low accuracy measurements in cases where the measurement interval is short. The article presents an original algorithm for reconstruction of the trace position. The reconstruction procedure calculates iteratively the trace position of the specified calibration data. The results of the simulations based on the MCNP5 package showed that compared with results obtained using the classical approach, the accuracy of the reconstruction position is increased by 46% for low noise counts and 38% for high noise counts. The technique can successfully be applied to monitor the motion of a radioactive tracer in a reactor. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kim, HR				Kim, Hee Reyoung			The radioactivity estimation of C-14 and H-3 in graphite waste samples of the KRR-2	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Radioactivity of C-14 and H-3; Graphite; KRR-2; LSC; Annual dose; Disposal	NUCLEAR-REACTOR; CONCRETE	The radioactivity of C-14 and H-3 in graphite samples from the dismantled Korea Research Reactor-2 (the KRR-2) site was analyzed by high-temperature oxidation and liquid scintillation counting, and the graphite waste was suggested to be disposed of as a low-level radioactive waste. The graphite samples were oxidized at a high temperature of 800 degrees C, and their counting rates were measured by using a liquid scintillation counter (LSC). The combustion ratio of the graphite was about 99% on the sample with a maximum weight of 1 g. The recoveries from the combustion furnace were around 100% and 90% in C-14 and H-3, respectively. The minimum detectable activity was 0.04-0.05 Bq/g for the C-14 and 0.13-0.15 Bq/g for the H-3 at the same background counting time. The activity of 14C was higher than that of H-3 over all samples with the activity ratios of the C-14 to H-3, C-14/H-3, being between 2.8 and 25. The dose calculation was carried out from its radioactivity analysis results. The dose estimation gave a higher annual dose than the domestic legal limit for a clearance. It was thought that the sampled graphite waste from the dismantled research reactor was not available for reuse or recycling and should be monitored as low-level radioactive waste.

In this process, the chemical decontamination process is carried out, and a fine Fe3O4 coating film is formed on the surface of stainless steel piping in an aqueous solution. In order to improve the suppression of Co-60 deposition further, we combined the original Hi-F with a preoxidation step. We found the deposited amount of Co-60 with preoxidized Hi-F coating film (OHi-FC) was 1/10 of that for non-coated specimens. In this study, we investigated the suppression mechanism of Co-60 for the OHi-FC. The composition of OHi-FC was changed from Fe3O4 to Fe2O3 and then the crystals in the OHi-FC grew three times larger than those of the original Hi-F coating film. Consequently the corrosion amount of the stainless steel base metal was reduced by getting larger grains in the coating film. Because Co-60 was incorporated into the corrosion oxide, the suppression effect of Co-60 deposition by preoxidation was attributed to the suppression of the formation of the corrosion oxide by the OHi-FC.

This method is applicable only to alpha particles, and because their penetration ranges are very short, the obtained images are very clear. Since the method is simple and inexpensive, it can be used even at the high-school level. From the etch pit density obtained by microscopic observation, the radioactivity density of materials can be determined by using some theoretical calculations.

The new version has been greatly improved from the previously released version, PHITS2.24, in terms of not only the code itself but also the contents of its package, such as the attached data libraries. In the new version, a higher accuracy of simulation was achieved by implementing several latest nuclear reaction models. The reliability of the simulation was improved by modifying both the algorithms for the electron-, positron-, and photon-transport simulations and the procedure for calculating the statistical uncertainties of the tally results. Estimation of the time evolution of radioactivity became feasible by incorporating the activation calculation program DCHAIN-SP into the new package. The efficiency of the simulation was also improved as a result of the implementation of shared-memory parallelization and the optimization of several time-consuming algorithms. Furthermore, a number of new user-support tools and functions that help users to intuitively and effectively perform PHITS simulations were developed and incorporated. Due to these improvements, PHITS is now a more powerful tool for particle transport simulation applicable to various research and development fields, such as nuclear technology, accelerator design, medical physics, and cosmic-ray research.

J	Fukano, Y				Fukano, Yoshitaka			Comprehensive and consistent interpretation of local fault experiments and application to hypothetical local overpower accident in Monju	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						FBR; sodium-cooled fast reactor; Monju; safety; safety assessment; severe accident; LF; local subassembly fault; enrichment error	SLSF EXPERIMENT P-4; BLOCKAGE EXPERIMENTS; TRANSIENT; PROPAGATION; CONCLUSIONS; BEHAVIOR	Experimental studies on local fault (LF) accidents in fast breeder reactors have been performed in many countries because LFs have been historically considered as one of the possible causes of severe accidents. Comprehensive and consistent interpretations of in-pile and out-of-pile experiments related to LF were arrived at in this study based on state-of-the-art review and data analysis techniques. Safety margins for a hypothetical local overpower accident, which was evaluated as a LF accident in the licensing document of the construction permit for a prototype fast breeder reactor called Monju, were also studied. Based on comprehensive interpretations of the latest experimental database, including those performed after the permission of Monju construction, it was clarified that the evaluation of the hypothetical local overpower accident in the Monju licensing was sufficiently conservative. Furthermore, it incorporated adequate safety margins in terms of failure thresholds of the fuel pin, molten fuel ejection, fuel sweep-out behavior after molten fuel ejection, and pin-to-pin failure propagation. Moreover, these comprehensive interpretations are valid and applicable to the safety evaluation of LF accidents of other fast breeder reactors with various fuel and core designs.

J	Pramuditya, S; Takahashi, M				Pramuditya, Syeilendra; Takahashi, Minoru			Core design study for power uprating of integral primary system PWR	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Integral PWR; IRIS; Power uprate; Core neutronics; Power flattening; Burnable poison	HEAT-TRANSFER; IRIS REACTOR; PRESSURIZER; FUEL	Core design study for power uprating of integral primary system PWR has been performed. The selected reference core design is a four-year straight burn option of the International Reactor Innovative and Secure (IRIS). The objective of this study is to evaluate the possibility of increasing thermal power of the IRIS reactor by 20%, for a better economic performance. This study includes core neutronic and thermal hydraulic aspects. The power uprate is achieved by minimizing core radial power peaking, and by increasing fuel enrichment and coolant mass flow rate. Parametric calculations have been carried out to optimize the power-uprated core design, with the objective of obtaining relatively low core power peaking and similar initial reactivity with that of the reference core. The optimization is achieved by means of enrichment zoning and application of burnable poison, with different configuration from that of the reference core. The performance of power-uprated core is compared with the reference core. The calculation results show that the proposed core-uprated design with thermal power of 1200 MWt shows preferable characteristics, such as low power peaking of around 1.43, negative reactivity coefficients, and relatively high MDNBR of 3.454.

An implicit code coupling of 1-D system code and 3-D in-house CFD code for multi-scaled simulations of nuclear reactor transients	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Multi-scale; Code coupling; CUPID; MARS	BREAK LOCA; MARS CODE; FLOW; STRATEGY; APR1400	A coupled multi-dimensional thermal-hydraulic system code, CUPID/MARS, has been developed by consolidating the MARS and CUPID codes. This enables users to take advantage of the very general, versatile features of MARS and the realistic three-dimensional features of the CUPID code. A calculation set of forced convection flows in a straight channel and manometer oscillations shows that mass is conserved at the interface cells of the MARS and CUPID, and the CUPID/MARS multi-scale coupling is successful in two-way direction in two phase flows as well as in single phase flows. The validation calculation for the Rossendorf Core Mixing (ROCOM) test, where the pressure vessel is calculated by the CUPID and the other components such as hot and cold legs are simulated by the MARS, shows that the multi-scale approach is cheap and convenient. By using the coupled code, we can simulate a specific part of a thermal-hydraulic system with CUPID and the others with the system code, which can provide the system code with a local zoom function.

The analysis concerns the experiment which includes two Leading Test Assemblies (LTA) of low enriched fuel, working together with highly enriched assemblies during standard reactor operation. At the time of estimated analysis the core configuration of the experiment was not known and calculations assumed operation in chosen standard conditions. After the experiment the whole analysis was repeated as "follow-up" calculations. Both sets of results were compared with measurements. This comparison gave a basis of prediction for the methods' evaluation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Marcinkowska, Z. E.; Kulikowska, T.

J	dos Santos, A; Fanaro, LCCB; Jerez, R				dos Santos, Adimir; Fanaro, Leda C. C.

The experimental approach considers a new technique for the (28)rho case which does not require any sort of calculated correction factors. This aspect gave to the IPEN/MB-01 experiment an excellent quality and free of possible bias due to these calculated correction factors. The uncertainty analysis show, even considering the uncertainties of the geometric and material data of the facility, that the final uncertainties are small enough and well understood for a benchmark problem. The experiment was evaluated and included in the IRPhE handbook. The theory/experiment comparison reveals that there is considerable progress in the U-238 nuclear data for application in thermal reactors. The theory/experiment comparison employs the nuclear data libraries ENDF/B-VII.0, ENDF/B-VI.8, JEF3.1, and JENDL3.3 and reveals an excellent agreement for the spectral index (28)rho* independently of the nuclear data library considered; aspect never found before in several other comparisons. The long term overprediction of the U-238 neutron epithermal capture appears to be eliminated with the improvements in the recent nuclear data libraries. The experimental performed at the IPEN/MB-01 reactor supports the changes in the U-238 nuclear data incorporated in ENDF/B-VII.0 as well as in the other libraries studied in this work. The theory/experiment comparison of 25 delta* and (C8/F)(ept) show that these spectral indices are in general slightly overpredicted, thus suggesting that the thermal fission cross section of U-235 might be a little bit underestimated. The overall analysis of the theory/experiment comparisons show the excellent applicability of ENDF/B-VII.0 for thermal reactors fuelled with slightly enriched uranium. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Sevon, T; Journeau, C; Ferry, L				Sevon, Tuomo; Journeau, Christophe; Ferry, Lionel			VULCANO VB-U7 experiment on interaction between oxidic corium and hematite-containing concrete	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Severe accident; Molten core-concrete interaction; MCCI		In a severe accident, the core of a reactor melts and forms corium, a mixture that includes molten UO2 and ZrO2. If the reactor pressure vessel fails, corium can interact with concrete. This paper describes the VB-U7 experiment, which was performed in the VULCANO facility in Cadarache, France, in co-operation between CEA and VIT. This test aims at studying the interaction of more than 50 kg of prototypic oxidic corium with EPR sacrificial ferro-siliceous concrete. The experimental configuration, the measured data and post examination and analysis results are presented. This test showed that EPR-type ferro-siliceous sacrificial concrete was anisotropically ablated by oxidic corium. This behavior is similar to that of other silica-rich concretes previously tested in CCI and VULCANO facilities. The corium temperature decreased to the value corresponding to about 50 vol% solid fraction when the concrete test section broke, leading to significant spreading. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Neutronic calculations of AFPR-100 reactor based on Spherical Cermet Fuel particles	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						AFPR-100; Small nuclear reactor; Spherical Cermets Fuel; TRISO fuel; Infinite multiplication factor; Instantaneous conversion ratio	BED NUCLEAR-REACTOR; CRITICALITY; PLUTONIUM	The Atoms For Peace Reactor (AFPR-100), as a 100 MW(e) without the need of on-site refueling, was originally based on UO2 TRISO fuel coated particles embedded in a carbon matrix directly cooled by light water. AFPR-100 is considered as a small nuclear reactor without open-vessel refueling which is proposed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). An account of significant irradiation swelling in the silicon carbide fission product barrier coating layer of TRISO fuel element, a Spherical Cermet Fuel element has been proposed. Indeed, the new fuel concept, which was developed by PNNL, consists of changing the pyro-carbon and ceramic coatings that are incompatible with low temperature by Zirconium. The latter was chosen to avoid any potential Wigner energy effect issues in the TRISO fuel element. Actually, the purpose of this study is to assess the goal of AFPR-100 concept using the Cermet fuel; undeniably, the fuel core lifetime prediction may be extended for reasonably long period without on-site refueling. In fact, we investigated some neutronic parameters of reactor core by the calculation code SRAC95. The results suggest that the core fuel lifetime beyond 12 equivalent full power years (EFPYs) is possible. Hence, the adoption of Cermet fuel concept shows a core lifetime decrease of about 3.1 EFPY.

X-ray scattering for the characterization of lyophilized breast tissue samples	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						X-ray scattering; Breast cancer; Lyophilized tissue; Tissue characterization	BENIGN; CANCER; EXPRESSION; SIGNATURES; PROTEIN; TUMORS; TESTS	This work investigates the possibility of characterizing breast cancer by measuring the X-ray scattering profiles of lyophilized excised breast tissue samples. Since X-ray scattering from water-rich tissue is dominated by scattering from water, the removal of water by lyophilization would enhance the characterization process. In the present study, X-ray scattering profiles of 22 normal, 22 malignant and 10 benign breast tissue samples are measured. The cut-offs of scatter diagrams, sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of three characterization parameters (full width at half maximum (FWHM) for the peak at 1.1 nm(-1), area under curve (AUC), and ratio of 1st to 2nd scattering peak intensities (I-1/I-2%)) are calculated and compared to the data from non-lyophilized samples. Results show increased sensitivity (up to 100%) of the present data on lyophilized breast tissue samples compared to previously reported data for non-lyophilized samples while the specificity (up to 95.4%), diagnostic accuracy (up to 95.4%) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve values (up to 0.9979) for both sets of data are comparable. The present study shows significant differences between normal samples and each of malignant and benign samples. Only subtle differences exist between malignant and benign lyophilized breast tissue samples where FWHM=0.7 +/- 0.1 and 0.8 +/- 0.3, AUC=1.3 +/- 0.2 and 1.4 +/- 0.2 and I-1/I-2%=44.9 +/- 11.0 and 52.4 +/- 7.6 for malignant and benign samples respectively.

The intensities of the beams injected into the storage cell, measured with a compression tube, are 7.5 x 10(16) hydrogen atoms/s (two hyperfine states) and 3.9 x 1016 deuterium atoms/s (three hyperfine states). For the hydrogen beam the achieved vector polarizations are p(z)approximate to +/- 0.92. For the deuterium beam, the obtained combinations of vector and tensor (p(zz)) polarizations are p(z)approximate to +/- 0.90 (with a constant p(zz)approximate to + 0.86), and p(zz) = +0.90 or pzz = 1.71 (both with vanishing p(z)). The paper includes a detailed technical description of the apparatus and of the investigations performed during the development. This source has been very successfully used for single and double polarization measurements at ANKE as well as for studies of the polarization of recombining hydrogen molecules.

Multi-purpose fast neutron spectrum analyzer with real-time signal processing	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Frontiers in Diagnostic Technologies (FDT)	NOV 28-30, 2011	Frascati, ITALY	Italian Agcy Energy New Technol & Sustainable Dev (ENEA), Italian Inst Nucl Phys (INFN)		Nuclear Fusion; Fast neutron detector; Neutron spectroscopy; DPSD; Real-time data treatment		Diagnostics of hot ion component of plasma on the products of fusion reactions is widely used on thermonuclear facilities. In case of employment of neutron spectrometers, based on organics scintillators, there is advanced technique developed to eliminate neutron pulses from gamma background-digital pulse shape discrimination. For every DPSD application it is necessary to use the fast (2-5 ns) and precise (12 bit) transient ADC unit with large amount of onboard memory for storing every digitized scintillation pulses during shot time. At present time the duration of hot thermonuclear plasma burning in large tokamaks approximate to 1 min, and this requires very high onboard memory capacity (similar to 100 GB). This paper describes a neutron spectrum analyzer with real-time DPSD algorithm, implemented to ADC unit. This approach saves about two orders of onboard memory capacity, gives the possibility of instant use of outcome to feedback systems. This analyzer was tested and calibrated with help of Co-60 and Cf-252 radiation sources, and deuterium neutron generator. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Sulyaev, Yu. S.; Puryga, E.

LIBS particular properties and optimal parameters were determined for in-depth PFCs characterisation. The LIBS method was in situ tested on the Joint European Torus (JET) in the UK with the EDGE LIDAR Laser System (Ruby laser, 3 J, 690 nm wavelength, 300 ps pulse duration, intensity up to 70 GW/cm(2)). Several analytical spectral lines of H, CII, Crl, and Bell in plasma were observed and identified in 400-600 nm spectral range with the optimised LIBS and detection system. The LIBS in-depth cartography is in agreement with the surface properties of the tile under analysis, thus confirming feasibility of in situ LIBS. Further LIBS technique improvements required to provide tritium concentration measurements more accurately are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we evaluated the Tc-99m-3P(4)-RGD(2) single photon emission computed tomography/computerized tomography (SPECT/CT) in patients suffering from space occupying disease of esophagus. 40 patients (34 males and 6 female; mean age: 58.3 years) with a suspected space occupying lesion of esophagus were included, thus finally obtaining their definite pathologic diagnosis (malignant, n=32; benign, n=8). All patients underwent endoscopic, barium esophagography and SPECT/CT imaging preoperatively. The chest SPECT was performed at 4 h after administration of Tc-99m-3P(4)-RGD(2) with a dose of 939 +/- 118 MBq. The diagnosis precision, sensitivity and specificity among these methods were compared. The relationship between radioactive uptake and clinical pathological stage of esophageal carcinoma was discussed by calculating the tumor to normal esophagus (T/N). Meanwhile, the integrin alpha v beta 3 expression was assessed immunohistochemically in postoperative esophageal tissues. 31 patients were diagnosed as esophageal carcinoma; and 1, leiomyosarcoma; and 6. leimyoma; and 2, esophageal tuberculosis. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of barium esophagography, endoscopic and SPECT/CT imaging are 92.5/93.8/87.5%, 97.5/96.9/100%, and 90/90.6/87.5%, respectively. Abnormal accumulation of radiotracer in 29 malignant lesions is observed. The SPECT/CT imaging displayed the region of radioactive uptake and lesions matched extremely with the TIN ratio from 1.31 to 2.79 (mean 2.04). A case with pulmonary metastases and a case with mediastinal lymph node metastases were found which were missed by barium esophagography and endoscopic. The Tc-99m-3P(4)-RGD(2) uptake of the esophageal carcinoma masses had no relevance to the tumor pathologic classification (P>0.05). There was a significant positive correlation between T/N ratio and positive cell percentage of integrin alpha v beta 3 (r=0.976), demonstrating the certain clinical potential in the diagnosis of esophageal carcinoma.

In this trial, the 199 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed lung lesions (169 malignant and 36 benign lesions) were imaged by whole body F-18-FDG PET/CT. Histopathology and clinic results served as the reference standard. The malignancy likelihood were conducted by CTscores; the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of lung lesions, and PET on FDG negative or positive, as well as metastasis index (MO, by PET combined with CT findings. The data were analyzed by stepwise logistic regression and receiver-operating-characteristic. The malignancy predictive probability (P) was obtained by P =e(x)(1+e(x)), where x=-1.16+0.87 (CTscore) +0.15(SUVmax)+0.27(MI). The area under curve (AUC) for the fitted logistic model was 0.82 +/- 0.04, this was superior and significantly different from SUVmax (AUC, 0.73 +/- 0.05) and CTscores(AUC, 0.71 +/- 0.05). The fitted logistic model could improve the diagnostic performance. The MI could help for differential diagnosis.

J	Ding, M; Kloosterman, JL				Ding Ming; Kloosterman Jan Leen			Feasibility neutronic design for the reactor core configurations of a 5 MWth transportable block-type HTR	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNIQUES			English	Article						Feasibility design; Reactor core configurations; Transportable reactors; Small modular reactors; Block-type HTRs	LONG-LIFE HTR; TESTS	Small long-life transportable high temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTRs) are interesting because they can safely provide electricity or heat in remote areas or to industrial users in developed or developing countries. This paper presents the neutronic design of the U-Battery, which is a 5 MWth block-type HTR with a fuel lifetime of 5-10 years. Assuming a reactor pressure vessel diameter of less than 3.7 m, some possible reactor core configurations of the 5 MWth U-Battery have been investigated using the TRITON module in SCALE 6. The neutronic analysis shows that Layout 12x2B, a scattering core containing 2 layers of 12 fuel blocks each with 20% enriched U-235, reaches a fuel lifetime of 10 effective full power years (EFPYs). When the diameter of the reactor pressure vessel is reduced to 1.8 m, a fuel lifetime of 4 EFPYs will be achieved for the 5 MWth U-Battery with a 25-cm thick graphite side reflector. Layouts 6x3 and 6x4 with a 25-cm thick BeO side reflector achieve a fuel lifetime of 7 and 10 EFPYs, respectively. The comparison of the different core configurations shows that, keeping the number of fuel blocks in the reactor core constant, the annular and scattering core configurations have longer fuel lifetimes and lower fuel cost than the cylindrical ones. Moreover, for the 5 MWth U-Battery, reducing the fuel inventory in the reactor core by decreasing the diameter of fuel kernels and packing fraction of TRISO particles is more effective to lower the fuel cost than decreasing the U-235 enrichment.

An arbitrary located radioactive point and volumetric cylindrical sources [Eu-152 aqueous radioactive sources covering the energy range from 121 keV up to 1408 keV] were used in order to get the full-energy peak efficiency (FEPE) based on the effective solid angle ratio. In addition, self attenuation of source matrix, the attenuation by the source container and the detector housing materials are also treated. Results are compared with those measured by a combination of two Nal(Tl) detectors of different volumes (3 '' x 3 '' and 2 '' x 2 '') with resolution (EWHM) at 662 keV equal to 7.5% and 8.5% respectively. The comparison between the calculated and the measured full-energy peak efficiency values reveal a good agreement. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The detection of these correlated neutrons is frequently used to quantify plutonium (Pu) and other fissile materials for international nuclear safeguards and related activities. However, detector dead time affects the observed rates of correlated neutrons in a non-trivial manner, and must be accounted for to obtain accurate results. A major simplification made in the most widely used dead time corrections is that the neutron detections are occurring randomly in time. A few previous attempts at providing a dead time model for correlated neutrons have been limited in scope, have made simplifying assumptions early in the derivation, and have, in general, not been implemented in the broader safeguards community. This paper provides an exact dead time model for correlated neutron detections in a single channel system assuming an updating dead time, and therefore a paralyzable system. This dead time model includes the assumption that a single exponential, with one characteristic decay constant, can describe the system neutron die-away profile. An exact model for the effects of dead time on measured gate moments is derived which is extendable to an arbitrary order of neutron correlation. This dead time model predicts the measured gate moments based on the dead time and underlying detection rates, including the effects from detection rates with an arbitrarily high order of correlation. The effects of dead time on the apparent singles, doubles, triples and quadruples rates using either event triggered, random or mixed gate structure is also derived. Either the equations for the measured gate moments or the apparent multiplicity rates can be numerically inverted to find the dead time corrected multiplicity rates. Although the model has been explicitly solved for rates up to and including quadruples, it is directly extendable to any order of correlation. This model is presented from the perspective of neutron counting. However, the model is mathematically applicable to any series of events which are temporally correlated through an exponential probability distribution and which are subject to a dead time-like filter.

It is excreted by patients and is discharged directly to sewer systems. Despite considerable dilution in waste water and the relatively short half-life of I-131, it is readily measured in sewage. This work presents I-131 concentrations in sewage sludge from three water pollution control plants (WPCPs) on Long Island, NY. Iodine-131 concentrations ranged from 0.027 +/- 0.002 to 148 +/- 4 Bq g(-1) dry weight. The highest concentrations were measured in the Stony Brook WPCP, a relatively small plant (average flow = 6.8 x 10(6) L d(-1)) serving a regional thyroid cancer treatment facility in Stony Brook, NY.
