The waste has to be conditioned for interim storage and later deep geological disposal, which requires extensive research and development work. The production of waste packages is supported by quality assurance checks and characterisation and inventorying programmes. The management of all produced waste packages together with the associated key data is done with the computer-based "Information System for Radioactive Materials (ISRAM)". This also ensures complete tracking of all existing waste packages from their production to their final disposal in a deep geological repository. For planning purposes and for design studies for the planned repositories in Switzerland, waste that will arise in the future also has to be taken into consideration. Using ISRAM as a basis, a "Model Inventory for Radioactive Materials (MIRAM)" was also developed; this contains all the key data required for safety analysis and facility planning. Together, these tools (ISRAM und MIRAM) form the basis for complete and comprehensive documentation and tracking of radioactive wastes up to the time of their geological disposal.

As this reactor type used sodium as a coolant in its primary and secondary circuit, 7 cold traps containing various amounts of partially activated sodium needed to be disposed of as part of the dismantling. The resulting combined difficulties of radioactive contamination and high chemical reactivity were handled by treating the cold traps differently depending on their size and the amount of sodium contained inside. Six small cold traps were processed on-site by cutting them up into small parts using a band saw under a protective atmosphere. The sodium was then converted to sodium hydroxide by using water. The remaining large cold trap could not be handled in the same way due to its dimensions (2.9 m x 1.1 m) and the declared amount of sodium inside (1,700 kg). It was therefore manually dismantled inside a large box filled with a protective atmosphere, while the resulting pieces were packaged for later burning in a special facility. The experiences gained by KNK during this process may be advantageous for future dismantling projects in similar sodium-cooled reactors worldwide.

A vertical-beam target station and high-power targetry for the cyclotron production of radionuclides with medium energy protons	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						66 MeV protons; Radionuclide production; Target stations; Vertical beams; High-power targetry	RADIOISOTOPE PRODUCTION; FACILITY; DESIGN; SYSTEM; BLIP	A vertical-beam target station (VBTS) is described to exploit the high-intensity proton beams delivered by the upgraded separated-sector cyclotron of iThemba LABS for the production of longer-lived, high value radionuclides such as Na-22, Ge-88 and Sr-82. Aspects of the targetry are discussed as well as a beam splitter, which makes it possible to perform radionuclide production bombardments simultaneously in two irradiation vaults. With tandem targets in two stations, four targets can be bombarded simultaneously. The delivery of 66 MeV proton beams of higher intensity has been realized by installing fixed frequency, flat-top RF resonators on both the main cyclotron and an injector cyclotron. The increase in beam intensity also required new non-destructive diagnostic components in the relevant high-energy beamlines. An overview is given of the current radionuclide production target stations, their similarities and differences and the role of the VBTS in the production programme. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The intense neutrino burst emitted in a SN explosion results in a large number of MeV neutrinos inside the instrumented volume of the neutrino telescope that can be detected (mainly) via the reaction (nu) over bar (e) + p -> e(+) + n. In this study we simulated the response of the underwater neutrino telescope to the electron antineutrino flux predicted by the Garching model for SN explosions. We assumed that the neutrino telescope comprises 6160 direction sensitive optical modules, each containing 31 small photomultiplier tubes. Multiple coincidences between the photomultiplier tubes of the same optical module are utilized to suppress the noise produced by K-40 radioactive decays and to establish a statistical significant signature of the SN explosion.

A Kalman Filter approach for track reconstruction in a neutrino telescope	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th workshop on very large volume neutrino telescopes	OCT 12-14, 2011	Erlangen, GERMANY			Neutrino telescope; Track reconstruction	SEA	In high energy neutrino telescopes, the detection principle relies on the detection of Cherenkov light emitted from an up-going muon induced by v, that have penetrated the Earth. In the muon energy range of interest for astrophysical searches (namely from about 100 GeV to about 1 PeV), the electromagnetic showers accompanying the muon track generate Cherenkov light emitted within a few degrees of the cone associated to the primary particle. Furthermore, because of photon scattering in the water, the measurement is affected by non-Gaussian noise. Consequently, the track reconstruction in underwater Cherenkov neutrino telescopes is strongly complicated. Moreover, environmental background originates large noise counting rate. In an undersea neutrino detector, in fact, the decay of radioactive elements, mainly the beta-decay of potassium isotope K-40, generates electrons that produce Cherenkov light leading an isotropic background of photons. Therefore, the hit-pattern identification of neutrino induced event is non-trivial and the track reconstruction has to deal with a non-linear problem due to this non-Gaussian measurement noise. In this paper a method, based on the Gaussian Sum Filter algorithm to take into account non-Gaussian process noise, for track reconstruction in a km(3) underwater neutrino telescope, is presented.

The method does not contain any a priori model of the photomultiplier detection efficiency and uses a modified Compton Coincidence technique, therefore it has been named the Zero Model By using Coincidence Scintillation (ZoMBieS) method. Validation measurements of the activity of a Ni-63 source against the Triple to Double Coincidence Ratio method are presented and the results agree within their standard uncertainties.

Because radioactive materials can adhere to vegetables, the authors made a qualitative evaluation of vegetables in Tsukuba, estimated internal exposure dose based on quantitative measurement results, and investigated several decontamination methods. Qualitative analysis of vegetable contamination was done by autoradiography. Quantitative analysis was done using a high-purity germanium detector. To assess decontamination, two methods were tested: one with running water and the other with boiling water. In addition, boiled soup stock was measured. In the qualitative evaluation by autoradiography, radioactive materials were not uniformly distributed but adhered to vegetables in clumps and hot spots. In the quantitative evaluation to measure contamination of outer and inner leaves of sanchu lettuce, it was observed that the concentration of I-131 was 8,031.35 +/- 764.79 Bq kg(-1) in the outer leaves and 115.28 +/- 20.63 Bq kg(-1) in the inner leaves. In addition, the concentration of Cs-137 was 1,371.93 +/- 366.45 Bq kg(-1) in the outer leaves and 9.68 +/- 15.03 Bq kg(-1) in the inner leaves. This suggests that one can greatly reduce internal exposure dose by removing the outer leaves if one has to eat vegetables just after a nuclear accident. In the decontamination assessment, a decontamination efficiency of up to 70% was achieved by boiling vegetables for 20 min.

To obtain average rates of ingestion of radionuclides, the volunteers were selected from among office, fisheries, agricultural, and livestock farm workers. Committed effective doses from ingestion of the diet over a 1-y period were calculated from the analytical results and from International Commission on Radiological Protection dose coefficients; for K-40, an internal effective dose rate from the literature was used. Fisheries workers had significantly higher combined internal annual dose than the other workers, possibly because of high rates of ingestion of marine products known to have high Po-210 concentrations. The average internal dose rate, weighted by the numbers of households in each worker group in Aomori Prefecture, was estimated at 0.47 mSv y(-1). Polonium-210 contributed 49% of this value. The sum of committed effective dose rates for Po-210, Pb-210, Ra-228, and C-14 and the effective dose rate of K-40 accounted for approximately 99% of the average internal dose rate.

This paper examines the initial experience with over 1,200 patients seen at a comprehensive cancer center. Radiation safety procedures for radiology, surgery, and pathology were implemented, and radioactive material inventory control was maintained using an intranet-based program. Surgical probes allowed for discrimination between I-125 seed photon energies from Tc-99m administered for sentinel node testing. A total of 1,127 patients (median age of 57.2 y) underwent RSL procedures with 1,223 seeds implanted. Implanted seed depth ranged from 10.3-107.8 mm. The median length of time from RSL implant to surgical excision was 2 d. The median I-125 activity at time of implant was 3.1 MBq (1.9 to 4.6). The median dose rate from patients with a single seed was 9.5 mu Sv h(-1) and 0.5 mu Sv h(-1) at contact and 1 m, respectively. The maximum contact dose rate was 187 mu Sv h(-1) from a superficially placed seed. RSL performed greater than 1 d before surgery is a viable alternative to WL, allowing flexibility in scheduling, minimizing day of surgery procedures, and improving workflow in breast imaging and surgery. RSL has been shown to be a safe and effective procedure for preoperative localization under mammographic and ultrasound guidance, which can be managed with the use of customized radiation protection controls.

The authors reviewed the medical records, including whole body counter measurements, of decontamination workers in villages near the crippled Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant to assess their levels of internal radiation exposure. In total, 83 decontamination workers were enrolled in this study. They were regularly engaged in decontamination activities in highly contaminated areas where surface Cs-137 deposition density was over 100 kBq m(-2). The present study showed low levels of internal exposure among the decontamination workers near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. The cesium burdens of all the decontamination workers were below detection limits. They had reported no acute health problems. The resuspension of radioactive materials may cause minimal internal contamination during decontamination activities.

Commonly commercialized cosmetic ingredients such as surfactants, mineral oil, or viscosifying agents were used in preparing the calixarene emulsion. The formulation was characterized in terms of size and apparent viscosity measurements and then was tested for its ability to limit uranyl ion permeation through excoriated pig-ear skin explants in 24-h penetration studies. Calixarene emulsion effectiveness was compared with two other reference treatments consisting of DTPA and EHBP solutions. Application of calixarene emulsion induced the highest decontamination effect with an 87% decrease in uranium diffusion flux. By contrast, EHBP and DTPA solutions only allowed a 50% and 55% reduction of uranium permeation, respectively, and had the same effect as a simple dilution of the contamination by pure water. Uranium diffusion decrease was attributed to uranyl ion-specific chelation by calixarene within the formulation, since no significant effect was obtained after application of the same emulsion without calixarene. Thus, calixarene cleansing emulsion could be considered as a promising treatment in case of accidental contamination of the skin by highly diffusible uranium compounds.

A new portable ganuna imaging system dedicated to the detection and the direct visualisation of hot spots in nuclear power plants	RADIOPROTECTION			French	Article						instrumentation; nuclear power plant; gamma radiation; gamma camera		In a nuclear power plant (NPP), the localization of radioactive hot spots is a major issue, as they are responsible for a significant part of the doses received by the workers, especially during maintenance operations. Since 2010, EDF and CEA have been adapting a new generation camera gamma, GAMPIX, to have a dedicated portable tool available for this use. This system enables to superimpose a gamma image with a visible image, in order to locate radioactive sources in a given area. On-site measurements at the Tricastin EDF NPP, combined with specific developments at CEA, have been carried out in order to meet the particular environmental and radiological conditions experienced in such industrial facilities: the relatively high energy of cobalt-60 (1.17 and 1.33 MeV) and the existence of an ubiquitous background. This article will present the specifications required, the corresponding improvements and the main results obtained during the on-site measurements campaigns. Even if they were dedicated to the qualification of the camera, the tests carried out showed useful results like the leakage lines along a lead protection and the displacement of a hot spot in a pipe (compared to its identified position). At the end, further developments are presented.

Contamination of Japanese foodstuffs of terrestrial origin after the Fukushima nuclear accident and related dose assessments Part 1: foodstuff contamination	RADIOPROTECTION			English	Article						Fukushima NPP accident; foodstuff contamination		During and after the Fukushima accident, the IRSN collected and interpreted the results of radiological measurements performed on foodstuffs of terrestrial origin published by Japan's Ministry of Health between mid-March 2011 and July 2012. Analysis of the findings shows that the accident's date, livestock-rearing practices and the deposits characteristics had a decisive influence. The fact that radioactive fallout occurred very early in the growing and breeding season largely explains the moderate contamination of most foodstuffs of terrestrial origin, notably in the areas with the largest deposits. In the case of dairy products and meat, feeding imported fodder to livestock in stables, a common practice in Japan, compounded the calendar effect. Measurements published in Japan have also borne out the particular sensitivity of mushrooms, including cultivated species, and game.

Operations were carried out with the strategy of mechanical dismantling with no cutting process. As the civil engineering radioactivity level was low, a great majority of it has been left in place with no processing, but compensatory measures have been taken for public and environmental protection. The overall result of these operations is a gain in both cost and operating time. They also contribute to a significant decrease in the risks, including radiological ones.

Chromosome aberrations in workers of beach sand mineral industries	RADIOPROTECTION			English	Article						chromosome aberration; beach sand mining; radiation worker; radon	SISTER-CHROMATID EXCHANGES; LEAD-EXPOSED WORKERS; IONIZING-RADIATION; BLOOD-LYMPHOCYTES; PERIPHERAL LYMPHOCYTES; OCCUPATIONAL-EXPOSURE; CYTOGENETIC DAMAGE; COAL-MINERS; URANIUM; RADON	Beach Sand Mining (BSM) is a profitable industry earning a sizable income for the country by way of foreign exchange. The Indian coast is rich in rare earths such as ilmenite, rutile, leucoxene, zircon, garnet and sillimanite, and is invariably associated with radioactive monazite. Due to the nature of the separation processes involved and the manual handling, workers in these factories are continuously being exposed to suspended particles containing naturally occurring radioactive materials. An attempt was made to estimate DNA damage using a chromosome aberration assay to monitor radiation effects in workers of BSM industries in India. The study group comprised 27 BSM workers and 20 controls. Percentage yields of dicentrics, acentric fragments and chromatid breaks observed in the control group were 0.058 +/- 0.017, 0.073 +/- 0.03 and 0.22 +/- 0.112, respectively. Percentage yields of dicentrics + centric rings, acentric fragments and chromatid breaks observed in the BSM group were 0.029 +/- 0.01 (P value 0.19), 0.24 +/- 0.06 (P value 0.006) and 0.455 +/- 0.06 (P value 0.0004), respectively. Elevated levels of fragments and chromatid aberrations are suggestive of low-dose radiation effects and also chemically-induced DNA damage.

The samples were collected from the area of a urea fertilizer factory, lagoon and Shitalakhya river in Narsingdi, Bangladesh. The activity concentrations of Ra-226 ranged from 3.16 +/- 0.32 to 10.28 +/- 0.55 Bq.kg(-1), 1.22 +/- 0.41 to 7.36 +/- 0.42 Bq.L-1 and 3.55 +/- 0.33 to 90.65 +/- 3.17 Bq.kg(-1) for soil, water and fertilizer samples, respectively. The Th-232 activity concentrations ranged from 4.89 +/- 0.45 to 15.82 +/- 0.45 Bq.kg(-1), 1.21 +/- 0.06 to 8.59 +/- 0.37 Bq. L-1 and 4.76 +/- 0.25 to 26.38 +/- 1.40 Bq.kg(-1) for soil, water and fertilizer samples, respectively. The K-40 activity concentrations ranged from 24.96 +/- 0.23 to 60.49 +/-. 0.56 Bq.kg(-1), 7.48 +/- 0.53 to 35.48 +/- 0.24 Bq.L-1 and 3.55 +/- 0.05 to 3051.71 +/- 19.53 Bq.kg(-1) for these samples, respectively. The radium equivalent activity, the hazard indices, the gamma activity concentration index, the indoor absorbed dose rate and the corresponding annual effective dose were estimated for the potential radiological hazard of the collected samples. The calculated values of the representative level index values (I gamma r) for all samples of the study area are lower than unity except the MOP sample. The activity ratios were also measured. These values are compared with reported values for other countries of the world. The results of the comparison studies show that the radioactivity concentrations and other radioactive indices of the samples of the study area are below the internationally accepted maximum permissible values. Therefore, this region is safe from any radiation hazard and no significant radiological threat was observed to the population of the study area.

Then the nuclear shell effect around N=126 is analyzed for very proton-rich nuclei with Z=85-92 based on the data of alpha-decay energies and half-lives. A long-lived island beyond the stable line is proposed where the half-lives of nuclei on this island are abnormally long.

The branch ratios for one-proton emission from excited states are calculated, which including spectroscopic factors, obtained from a Shell-model calculation with realistic interactions. The branch ratios show that the two-proton emission from the 1(-) state of Ne-18 at 7.94 MeV is most likely to go through the sequential decay. The same mechanism is discussed for other excited states at higher energy by different interactions.

Both of the 15.5T magnet and the VTI are conductively cooled with GM refrigeration. The commissioning test of the system is still ongoing because unexpected troubles occurred during the commissioning. Also, a SQUID system with the maximum field of 71 has been installed at another radiation control area to investigate the magnetic property of uranium and its isotopes. These devices are very useful to study the electro-magnetic properties of the neutron irradiated superconducting strands. This paper will introduce the new superconducting test facility, and some data recently obtained will be presented together with the data of magnetization evaluated with the SQUID, and the discussion on the irradiation effect on superconducting properties will be performed.

Thereafter, the additional deuterium ion implantation to these tungsten samples was performed to evaluate the change of hydrogen isotope retention capacity in the samples by long-term plasma exposure. It was found that the carbon-dominant mixed-material layer with more than 100 nm thickness was formed on a wide area of the tungsten surface. The thicker mixed-material layer was formed on the DP sample, where the deuterium retention was about 21 times as high as that for pure W. The major desorption temperature of deuterium was shifted toward higher temperature side, which was cornparable to the trapping characteristic of carbon or irradiation damages. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

By light ion irradiation, most of deuterium was trapped by vacancies, whose retention was almost saturated at the damage level of 0.2 dpa. For the heavy ion irradiation, the deuterium trapping by voids was found, indicating that cascade collisions by the heavy ion irradiation would create the voids in tungsten. Most of deuterium trapped by the voids was desorbed in higher temperature region compared to that trapped by vacancies. It was also found that deuterium could accumulate in the voids, resulting in the formation of blisters in tungsten. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Application of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy for characterization of material deposits and tritium retention in fusion devices	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	27th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 24-28, 2012	Liege, BELGIUM	Trilateral Euregio Cluster, SCK CEN, ERM KMS, FZJ, FOM		Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS); Deposition; Fuel retention; Depth profile; Quantitative analysis	WALL; DIAGNOSTICS; COMPONENTS	Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is discussed as a possible method to characterize the composition, tritium retention and amount of material deposits on the first wall of fusion devices. The principle of the technique is the ablation of the co-deposited layer by a laser pulse with P (power density) >= 0.5 GW/cm(2) and the spectroscopic analysis of the light emitted by the laser induced plasma. The typical spatial extension of the laser plasma plume is in the order of 1 cm with typical plasma parameters of n(e) approximate to 3 x 10(22) m(-3) and T-e approximate to 1-2 eV averaged over the plasma lifetime which is below 1 mu s. In this study "ITER-Like" mixed deposits with a thickness of about 2 mu m and consisting of a mixture of W/Al/C and D on bulk tungsten substrates have been analyzed by LIBS to measure the composition and hydrogen isotopes content at different laser energies, ranging from about 2 J/cm(2) (0.3 GW/cm(2)) to about 17 J/cm(2) (2.4 GW/cm(2)) for 7 ns laser pulses. It is found that the laser energies above about 7 J/cm(2) (1 GW/cm(2)) are needed to achieve the full removal of the deposit layer and identify a clear interface between the deposit and the bulk tungsten substrate by applying 15-20 laser pulses while hydrogen isotopes decrease strongly after the first laser pulse.

The additional D desorption stage was observed around 660 K in the TDS spectrum for a sample implanted with D-2(+) up to the fluence of 10(23) D+ m(-2), which desorption stage was not observed the D-2(+) implanted sample with the fluence less than 10(22) D+ m(-2). The TEM observation showed that the highly dense voids were formed in tungsten by D-2(+) implantation with the fluence of 10(23) D+ m(-2), considering that the D would be trapped by voids. To understand the D trapping by voids in C+ implanted tungsten, C+-D-2(+) sequential implantation experiments at various C+ implantation temperatures were performed. It was found that the amount of D desorbed around 560 K was increased by increasing the C+ implantation temperature. The formation of the voids was observed with increasing the C+ implantation temperature by TEM, indicating that the increase of D desorption around 560 K was caused by the formation of voids. However, the desorption temperature of D trapped by voids in C+ implanted sample was lower than that in D-2(+) implanted one. TEM observation and XPS measurement indicated that this difference was caused by the increase of void size and/or the presence of implanted carbon. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The design and performance analysis of the TBM body have been carried out considering the uniqueness of the KO TBM and design requirements by the 10 and KO design concept: (1) KOTBM has 4 sub-modules considering a post irradiation test (PIE) and its delivery. (2) A first wall (FW) design was changed into a 15 x 11 rectangular shape and its performance was confirmed by thermal-hydraulic and thermo-mechanical analyses using commercial ANSYS code. The results showed that the revised design model satisfied 1.5S(m) and 3S(m) of the allowable stress (S-m) in the RCC-MR code at the maximum stress region of the components for mechanical and thermo-mechanical analyses, respectively. (3) Considering the tritium breeding and cooling, a breeding zone (BZ) design was investigated. Three Li and Be layers, and one graphite layer, were proposed by the iteration, and the appropriate temperature distribution was obtained. The design for other components such as a side wall (SW) and back manifold (BM) is on-going considering 9 MPa of channel pressure and its functions of flow distribution as a manifold.

Many design features of the preliminary design are under revision with the aim to achieve the built-to-print-status. This paper deals with design and analysis of a bolted joint for the Blanket Shield Module with special perspective on Remote Handling capability. The BSM of the ECH Launcher is attached to the Launcher Main Frame by a bolted joint conceived so that in the Hot Cell Facility, RH maintenance can be performed on internal components. The joint must be capable to resist very high Electra-Magnetic loads from disruptions, while it has to sustain substantial thermal cycling during operation. Thus the need for a rigid and reliable design is essential. Beside the set of pre-stressed bolts the flanges were therefore equipped with additional shear keys to divert radial moments away from the bolts. Main focus of the work performed was the mechanical design of the joint and the assessment of the structural integrity with respect to the loads applied and its capability for maintenance by RH procedures. To fulfill a major aspect of the RH requirements, the bolts were designed as "captive" in order to avoid their accidental removal from the joint. The captive bolt design is based on a concept that uses a dedicated spring ring, a standard spiral spring and a tensioning screw with two threads to secure the bolts in a form-locking stop. The final approval phase of the RH compatibility foresees simulations in Virtual Reality and physical tests on prototypes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A first approach for CPRHS path optimization was previously proposed using line guidance as the navigation methodology to be adopted. This approach might not lead to feasible paths in new situations not considered during the previous work, as rescue operations. This paper addresses this problem by presenting a complementary approach for path optimization inspired in rigid body dynamics that takes full advantage of the rhombic like kinematics of the CPRHS. It also presents a methodology that maximizes the common parts of different trajectories in the same level of ITER buildings. The results gathered from 500 optimized trajectories are summarized. Conclusions and open issues are presented and discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the framework of the grant F4E-2009-GRT-026, CEA IRFM studied the maintenance in parallel with the design of the antenna provided by CCFE. The RVTL are 8 components of the ICRH antenna which form the interface between the matching system and the four port junction integrating the straps. A folded stub is attached to the principal line to ensure water cooling of the interspace. At the front and the rear of the RVTL are installed double RF windows that provide the first tritium barrier. In case of failure of the first window, all the RVTL have to be replaced. Due to the contamination and activation, the replacement must take place in the hot cell. The complete maintenance sequence is studied. It starts when the PP is in place in the Tokamak equatorial port, it continues with: the preparation in the port cell, transfer to the HC, cleaning, RVTL replacement, returns to the port cell. It finishes with reconnection to the port. The ITER requirements [1] and the hot cell constraints [2] are used to extract specifications for the RH tooling (for handling, cutting, welding, etc.). Each step is studied and suitable tools identified. For specific steps, mechanical concepts for dedicated tools are proposed. Furthermore, the critical steps identified are simulated to check the feasibility. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The maintenance configuration considered here is the Vertical Remote Handling, meaning gravity acting along the launcher radial axis. The plant, where the maintenance under consideration is occurring, is the Hot Cell Facility Work Cell. The study here reported has been carried out within the presently ongoing EFDA Goal Oriented Training program on Remote Handling (GOT-RH), which aims to support ITER activities. This document and its contents have to be considered as part of a more vast RAMI analysis to be developed within the GOT-RH, which aims to maximize the Electron Cyclotron Heating and Current Drive system availability. The Baseline CAD model of the Electron Cyclotron Heating and Current Drive Upper Launcher is currently in its preliminary design phase and does not provide enough details for developing a fully detailed maintenance strategy. Therefore, through a System Engineering approach, a set of assumptions was conceived on the launcher structure, as a basis for development of a Remote Handling strategy. Moreover, to compare different design solutions related to the possibility of integrating a quasi-optical component into the Blanket Shield Module, a Trade-Off was made, and its contents are shown here. The outcome of this System Engineering approach has been formalized into Task Definition Forms whose contents are reported here. The Remote Handling strategy presented in this work will be tested in the near future both through Virtual Reality simulations and through prototype experiments. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Different CPRHS typologies will be autonomously guided following predefined trajectories. Therefore, the localization of any CPRHS in operation must be continuously known in real time to provide the feedback for the control system and also for the human supervision. This paper proposes a localization system that uses the video streaming captured by the multiple cameras already installed in the ITER scenario to estimate with precision the position and the orientation of any CPRHS. In addition, an augmented reality system can be implemented using the same video streaming and the libraries for the localization system. The proposed localization system was tested in a mock-up scenario with a scale 1:25 of the divertor level of Tokamak building. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This work aims at providing a single formalism and tools to define in a generic way the ITER maintenance tasks and scenarios for in-vessel and hot cell operations. A three-layered approach is proposed to model these tasks and scenarios. Physical actions are defined for the scene elements. From these physical actions, behaviours are defined to represent high-level functionalities. Finally, interaction modes define the way that behaviours are achieved in terms of human-machine interactions. Case study concerning the blanket maintenance procedure is discussed concerning the contributions of the descriptive model and the context-based assistances to the activities of supervisory control.

Haptic shared control improves hot cell remote handling despite controller inaccuracies	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	27th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 24-28, 2012	Liege, BELGIUM	Trilateral Euregio Cluster, SCK CEN, ERM KMS, FZJ, FOM		Remote handling; Teleoperation; Haptic share control; Model inaccuracies	PERFORMANCE; FEEDBACK	A promising solution to improve task performance in ITER hot cell remote handling is the use of haptic shared control. Haptic shared control can assist the human operator along a safe and optimal path with continuous guiding forces from an intelligent autonomous controller. Previous research tested such controllers with accurate knowledge of the environment (giving flawless guiding forces), while in a practical implementation guidance forces will sometimes be flawed due to inaccurate models or sensor information. This research investigated the effect of zero and small (7.5 mm) errors on task performance compared to normal (unguided) operation. In a human factors experiment subjects performed a three dimensional virtual reality peg-in-hole type task (30 mm diameter; 0.1 mm clearance), with and without potentially flawed haptic shared control. The results showed that the presence of guiding forces, despite of small guiding errors, still improved task performance with respect to unguided operations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Thomas, J; Loving, A; Bachmann, C; Harman, J				Thomas, Justin; Loving, Antony; Bachmann, Christian; Harman, Jon			DEMO hot cell and ex-vessel remote handling	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	27th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 24-28, 2012	Liege, BELGIUM	Trilateral Euregio Cluster, SCK CEN, ERM KMS, FZJ, FOM		Remote handling; DEMO; Manipulator; Hot cell		In Europe the work on the specification and design of a demonstration power plant (DEMO) is being carried out by EFDA in the power plant physics and technology (PPP&T) programme. DEMO will take fusion from experimental research into showing the potential for commercial power generation. During the fusion reaction, components in the tokamak become highly activated. The estimated dose rate levels after shutdown (zero decay time) due to 60 dpa accumulation in steel (blanket) and 30 dpa (divertor) are 13.1-17.4 kGy/h (blanket); 8.8-11.6 kGy/h (divertor) [1], much higher than those to be encountered at ITER. Upon removal from the tokamak, components would be transported to the hot cell facility with attention to minimizing the spread of activated dust and tritium contamination. It is proposed to use a sealed cask of similar to 20 tonnes, running on air castors with 50% lifting capability redundancy. Due to the number and complexity of the routes taken by this transporter it would have to be an un-tethered semi-autonomous system. This poses some technical challenges, including providing sufficient battery capacity, reliable guidance and a fail safe un-tethered control system. The mass of the components being moved is assumed here to range from a few tonnes to in excess of one hundred tonnes. Before the removed in-vessel components can be processed in the hot cell, they would require a period of cooling, approximately 2.5 years, to allow dose rate and decay heating to reduce. This reduces the decay heating level to similar to 1-1.5 kW/m(3) and a contact dose rate to similar to 250 Sv/h, which is more suited to dexterous man-in-the-loop remote handling (RH). During maintenance, many components would require replacement or refurbishment. The hot cell facility would have to provide all the associated RH functions and operate fully remotely. With no human intervention, an accordingly robust RH recovery system would be required. This paper describes the first steps being taken towards the design of the DEMO hot cell. It will show a comparison of the current DEMO in-vessel maintenance concepts from a hot cell perspective, describe a proposed ex-vessel transport system, and summarize the facilities that have been identified as required within the hot cell, examine current RH technology and discuss the identified critical development issues.

Evaluating ITER remote handling middleware concepts	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	27th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 24-28, 2012	Liege, BELGIUM	Trilateral Euregio Cluster, SCK CEN, ERM KMS, FZJ, FOM		Remote handling; Haptic; Virtual reality; Master-slave; Middleware		Remote maintenance activities in ITER will be performed by a unique set of hardware systems, supported by an extensive software kit. A layer of middleware will manage and control a complex set of interconnections between teams of operators, hardware devices in various operating theatres, and databases managing tool and task logistics. The middleware is driven by constraints on amounts and timing of data like real-time control loops, camera images, and database access. The Remote Handling Study Centre (RHSC), located at FOM institute DIFFER, has a 4-operator work cell in an ITER relevant RH Control Room setup which connects to a virtual hot cell back-end. The centre is developing and testing flexible integration of the Control Room components, resulting in proof-of-concept tests of this middleware layer. SW components studied include generic human-machine interface software, a prototype of a RH operations management system, and a distributed virtual reality system supporting multi-screen, multi-actor, and multiple independent views. Real-time rigid body dynamics and contact interaction simulation software supports simulation of structural deformation, "augmented reality" operations and operator training. The paper presents generic requirements and conceptual design of middleware components and Operations Management System in the context of a RH Control Room work cell. The simulation software is analyzed for real-time performance and it is argued that it is critical for middleware to have complete control over the physical network to be able to guarantee bandwidth and latency to the components.

Analysis of human-in-the-loop tele-operated maintenance inspection tasks using VR	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	27th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 24-28, 2012	Liege, BELGIUM	Trilateral Euregio Cluster, SCK CEN, ERM KMS, FZJ, FOM		Remote maintenance; Tele-manipulation; ITER; Human factors experiment; Task performance		One of the challenges in future fusion plants such as ITER is the remote maintenance of the plant. Foreseen human-in-the-loop tele-operation is characterized by limited visual and haptic feedback from the environment, which results in degraded task performance and increased operator workload. For improved tele-operated task performance it is required to get insight in the expected tasks and problems during maintenance at ITER. By means of an exploratory human factor experiment, this paper analyses problems and bottlenecks during the execution of foreseen tele-operated maintenance at ITER, identifying most promising areas of improvement. The focus of this paper is on free space (sub)tasks where contact with the environment needs to be avoided. A group of 5 subjects was asked to carry-out an ITER related free space task (visual inspection), using a six degree of freedom master device connected to a simulated hot cell environment. The results show large variation in time performance between subjects and an increasing number of collisions for more difficult tasks, indicating room for improvement for free space (sub)tasks. The results will be used in future research on the haptic guidance strategies in the ITER Remote Handling framework. (C) 2013 FOM institute DIFFER (Dutch Institute for Fundamental Energy Research).

A fraction of this fusion fuel remains inside of the machine due to various mechanisms. The evaluation of this retention in present fusion experiments is of crucial importance to estimate the expected tritium inventory in ITER which shall be limited due to safety considerations. At ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) sufficiently time-resolved measurements should take place to extrapolate from current 10 s discharges to the at least intended 400s ones of ITER. To achieve this, a new measurement system has been designed that enables accuracy of better than one per cent. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, an effect of water vapor in the purge gas to Li mass loss has not been understood. In this study, mass loss of Li2TiO3 (NFI) and Li4SiO4 (FzK) under hydrogen atmosphere (1000 Pa H-2/Ar), and mass loss of Li2TiO3 (NFI) and Li2TiO3 with additional Li which is in a developmental stage (JAEA) under water vapor atmosphere (50 Pa H2O/Ar) were compared, respectively. It was found that under hydrogen atmosphere Li mass loss of Li4SiO4 and Li2TiO3 is same degree although the amount of water vapor released from Li4SiO4 is larger than that from Li2TiO3. It was clarified with regard to Li2TiO3 that Li mass loss in water vapor atmosphere is larger than that in hydrogen atmosphere. Mass loss of Li2TiO3 with additional Li (JAEA) was larger than that of Li2TiO3 (NFI). It was observed by X-ray analysis that Li deposits formed on the inner wall of the quartz tube contain Li2SiO3.

This pumping train shall cover the full operational pressure regime of a fusion reactor and is based on two pump types, namely diffusion pumps and liquid ring pumps. The whole pumping train must fulfill high safety and reliability requirements and it has to be made fully tritium compatible. In this paper, the design of a prototype pumping train and the special requirements for a DEMO machine are presented and discussed. A central feature of this pumping train is the use of a liquid metal as tritium compatible working fluid in both pump types, that leads to a pumping train which is able to cover a pressure range of 12 decades, namely from 10(-9) to 10(3) mbar. Finally, a test facility for pump testing over a wide pressure regime is described. In this facility (THESEUS), experiments with a diffusion pump have been performed and first results are presented.

A gas turbine high-temperature reactor of 300-MWe (600 MW) nominal capacity (GTHTR300) is assumed as the calculation target, and using the continuous-energy Monte Carlo transport code MVP-BURN, burn-up simulations for the three-dimensional entire-core region of the GTHTR300 were performed. A Li loading pattern for the continuous tritium recovery system in the gas-cooled reactor is presented. It is shown that module gas-cooled reactors with a total thermal output power of 3 GW in all can produce 6 kg of tritium maximum in a year. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The 3D model is further numerically implemented and experimentally validated. The model is composed of an energy balance, mass balance and momentum balance and hydriding reaction kinetics. These differential equations are solved using finite element method. The experimental consisting in absorption of hydrogen and deuterium gas was made in batch made, under vacuum condition. Before absorption, an activation of the titanium bed was performed. A number of loading and releasing operations typically required in tritium handling loops were conducted using one bed containing a well determined quantity of titanium sponge. A comparison between theoretical results and experimental data has found that the gas was not uniformly absorbed on the metal bed volume. This work provides an important platform to understand the phenomena during tritium absorption on a titanium storage bed and the development of a real-time tritium storage control system.

Since complicated phenomena in the blanket, especially a coupling effect between neutronics and heat transfers, make accurate analyses of the blanket very challenging. Therefore, advanced analysis method should be adopted to resolve the multi-physical problem. The present study uses COMSOL multi-physics code for thermal analyses of the blanket, since the COMSOL conceptually has sufficient capability of considering the heat transfer, neutronics, and even tritium behaviors together in a single code framework. As a part of this track, this study first validates the thermal-hydraulic analysis capability of the COMSOL by comparing with the CFD code, which can provide accurate thermal prediction for complicated single phase flow problems. This study selects KO HCML TBM as the reference blanket design for the validation because the detailed TBM design and preliminary analysis are available. Peak temperatures at the top and bottom region of TBM by COMSOL were 897.49 K and 882.69K, respectively. The maximum deviation of peak temperature to the CFD result was below 1.5%. And the temperature distributions of two codes were overall similar to each other. Therefore, it is concluded that the COMSOL has an acceptable thermal-hydraulic analysis capability.

In order to mitigate the release of tritium to the environment, these systems are combined by feeding hydrogen exhaust from the ISS into the WDS for final processing. Therefore, the WDS is the final tritium barrier before releasing hydrogen (H-2) exhaust to the environment. The TRENTA 4 scaled prototype facility at TLK is based on combination of the combined electrolysis and catalytic exchange (CECE) process and a cryogenic distillation (CD) process. All components are fully tritium compatible and controlled using a state of the art control system for process automation, backed up by an additional dedicated safety system. The paper will give a detailed overview of the current experimental facility including all process components. Furthermore the paper will present the results of the functional test of the WDS/ISS combination using protium and deuterium, as well the results of the first commissioning runs using HTO of approximately 5 x 10(9) Bq kg(-1) activity concentration.

Cryosorption is one of the methods for hydrogen isotope separation, and is often employed to gas chromatograph (GC) for hydrogen isotope analysis. Synthetic zeolite is used as the packing material of separation column for GC. And, it is well known that the retention time becomes long at 77 K. A zeolite having good separation capability at higher temperature may bring short retention time with good sensitivity. Mordenite type zeolite (MOR) in which cation was exchanged has been reported having comparatively good isotope separation capability. The present authors have investigated adsorption capacity of hydrogen isotope on cation-exchanged MORs at various temperatures. And, it has been shown that MOR with Ca2+ as exchanged cation (Ca-MOR) has fairly large adsorption capacity. In this work, the breakthrough curves of hydrogen adsorption on Ca-MOR at 194, 175 K have been observed, and mass transfer coefficients or effective diffusivity in Ca-MOR particle have been estimated. The rate-controlling step is the diffusion process in the adsorbent particle. The isotope effect on hydrogen diffusion in Ca-MOR particle is larger than raw material (Na-MOR). Therefore, Ca-MOR is more suitable for the separation column than Na-MOR. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Li2TiO3 with excess Li (Li2+xTiO3+y) was developed as an advanced tritium breeder. Pebble fabrication by the sol-gel method is a promising technique for the mass production of advanced tritium breeder pebbles. I have been developing a sal-gel technique for fabricating Li2+xTiO3+y pebbles, and the next step is to optimize the granulation conditions to reach the target value. In a previous study, the average grain size on the surfaces and cross sections of sintered Li2+xTiO3+y pebbles was large whereas the theoretical density (T.D.) of these pebbles was small. To increase the density of the sintered Li2+xTiO3+y pebbles, the sintering temperature was changed, and at 1353 K, the density of the pebbles increased to approximately 85% T.D. without any increase in the grain size. This suggests that the pore size in the sintered Li2+xTiO3+y pebbles decreased because of sintering in vacuum and argon. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, lithium and beryllium react under normal operating conditions, and therefore, a high-functional tritium breeder such as lithium beryllium oxide (Li2Be2O3) needs to be developed to compensate for this reaction under high-temperatures. LiOH center dot H2O and BeO powders were mixed in stoichiometric proportions at a Li/Be molecular ratio of 1.0. The sintering temperature was established as 1073 K by thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA). The Li/Be molar ratio of the reaction products measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) after the reaction agreed with the nominal molar ratio obtained by mixing LiOH center dot H2O and BeO. Crystal structure analysis of this powder was performed by the XRD technique. The XRD patterns of products were the same as those of Li2Be2O3 as listed in the JC-PDF-Card, and no impurities were indicated. The results indicate that the solid-state reaction of LiOH center dot H2O and BeO is suitable for synthesizing lithium beryllium oxide (Li2Be2O3). (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The facility is the first and quite unique facility in Japan, where tritium, beta and gamma RI species, and beryllium (Be) can simultaneously be used. The amounts of tritium used and stored are 3.7 TBq per glove box and 7.4TBq, respectively. Some tritium water samples of 38 GBq has been stored at the equipment on March 2012. The material of the column of the micro gas chromatograph has been studied to develop a real time analysis tool for the hydrogen isotope composition in gas phase. The calorimeter has also been studied as a possible tritium measurement method in solid waste. A set of basic data on the interaction between materials and tritium has been measured by various methods. The behavior of tritium in Fe and W has been studied as a typical subject. As a study for the tritium durability, the endurance of ion exchange membrane has been tested by using high concentration tritium water. The curves of strength vs. dose for the Nafion membranes in tritium water were well consistent with those by gamma rays and electron beams irradiations. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Stable metal tritides are viewed as potential candidates for the high-density storage of tritium. Metal tritide formers offer a safe and convenient method for tritium storage. For the storage, supply, and recovery of hydrogen isotopes, zirconium cobalt (ZrCo) and depleted uranium (DU) have been extensively proposed. Thus, we have designed and fabricated two identical small-scale getter beds for a comparison of ZrCo with DU on the hydriding/dehydriding properties. After the powderization of the metals, the hydriding/dehydriding performance at different stoichiometries of ZrCo and DU was measured. We provide preliminary experimental results of our ZrCo and DU beds. (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Pb in Li15.7Pb breeder material will be irradiated in the HCLL TBM model by high fluxes of 14 MeV D-T fusion neutrons during test in ITER. The objective of the present work was to validate available computational tools and nuclear data used for calculation of Hg-203 activity produced in Pb and LiPb material irradiated in 14 MeV D-T like neutron fields. The samples of Pb and LiPb were irradiated in several day long experiment performed at FNG Laboratory in Frascati. Hg-203 activity in samples was measured after complete decay of Pb-203 interfering radioisotope with the use of HPGe spectrometers. The MCNP model of the experiment was developed and neutron fluxes in each sample were calculated with the use of FENDL-2.1 transport library. Hg-203 activities in samples were calculated using two methods: FISPACT-2007 code with EAF-2010 library and based on MCNP calculated reaction rates (Pb-206(n, alpha) and Pb-207(n, n'alpha)) with the use of JEFF-3.1, JENDL-4.0 and FENDL-2.1 libraries. Finally, the experimental and simulated results were compared and C/E values with assessed uncertainties calculated. The C/E value for JEFF-3.1 and EAF-2010 is 0.85 and for JENDL-4.0 is 1.16.
