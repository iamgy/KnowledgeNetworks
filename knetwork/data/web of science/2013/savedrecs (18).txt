Photosynthetically fixed carbon is distributed into the leaf and the root compartments, and a part of the carbon accumulated in the leaf compartment is redistributed to the root compartment. The model parameters were estimated by using data obtained from exposure of the plant to (CO2)-C-13. The model estimates were in good agreement with the experimental observations, showing that the newly developed compartment model is applicable to assessment of the accumulation of C-14 in Japanese radish plants around the nuclear facility. In this study, respiration rate was set to be proportional to the carbon mass of the compartment, though the respiration rate has been assumed generally to be proportional to the growth rate of the compartment. While the estimates using both respiration rates differed only slightly from each other, the ratio of the respiratory rate of the root to that of the leaf was too high in the case of the respiratory rate proportional to the growth rate.

RADIATION RISK OF MALIGNANT NEOPLASMS IN ORGANS OF MAIN DEPOSITION FOR PLUTONIUM IN THE COHORT OF MAYAK WORKERS WITH REGARD TO HISTOLOGICAL TYPES	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						cancer; health effects; nuclear workers; plutonium	ATOMIC-BOMB SURVIVORS; LUNG-CANCER; COLLABORATIVE ANALYSIS; NUCLEAR-COMPLEX; MORTALITY; THOROTRAST; RADON; MICRODISTRIBUTION; DOSIMETRY; MINERS	This paper presents the results of analyses of the incidence of malignant neoplasms in lung, liver, and bone and associated connective tissues among Mayak nuclear workers exposed to both internally incorporated plutonium and to external gamma radiation. The study cohort included 22,373 individuals employed at the reactors and radiochemical and plutonium production facilities of the Mayak nuclear complex during 1948-1982 and followed up to the end of 2004. All analyses were carried out by Poisson regression, and the doses used were derived using a recently available update of organ doses, Mayak doses-2008. There was clear evidence for the linear association between internal plutonium dose and the risk of lung cancer. For males, there was evidence of a significant internal plutonium dose response for all histological types of lung cancer evaluated (adenocarcinoma, squamous-cell, and other epithelial); the estimated excess relative risk (ERR)/Gy for adenocarcinoma was the largest (ERR/Gy = 32.5; 95% CI: 16.3; 71.9), about 11-fold higher than that for squamous-cell lung cancer (ERR/Gy = 3.1; 95% CI: 0.3; 9.1). The relationship between liver cancer risk and plutonium exposure was best described by a linear-quadratic (LQ) function, but the LQ effect was diminished after restricting internal doses <2 Gy. Hepatocellular cancer was the most frequently observed type of liver cancer associated with internal plutonium exposure, and hemangiosarcomas were exclusively observed only at high internal plutonium doses (>4 Gy). For malignant neoplasms of bone and associated connective tissues, the trend was not statistically significant in relation to internal plutonium dose, but a statistically significantly higher risk (RR=13.7; 95% CI=3.0; 58.5) was found among unmonitored female plutonium workers who were employed in the most hazardous plutonium production facility commissioned prior to 1950.

ENHANCED ANALYSIS METHODS TO DERIVE THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF I-131 DEPOSITION ON THE GROUND BY AIRBORNE SURVEYS AT AN EARLY STAGE AFTER THE FUKUSHIMA DAIICHI NUCLEAR POWER PLANT ACCIDENT	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						accident; reactor; environmental assessment; I-131; monitoring; environmental	SYSTEM; JAPAN	This paper applies both new and well tested analysis methods to aerial radiological surveys to extract the I-131 ground concentrations present after the March 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant (NPP) accident. The analysis provides a complete map of I-131 deposition, an important quantity incalculable at the time of the accident due to the short half-life of I-131 and the complexity of the analysis. A map of I-131 deposition is the first step in conducting internal exposure assessments, population dose reconstruction, and follow-up epidemiological studies. The short half-life of I-131 necessitates the use of aerial radiological surveys to cover the large area quickly, thoroughly, and safely. Teams from the U. S. Department of Energy National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) performed aerial radiological surveys to provide initial maps of the dispersal of radioactive material in Japan. This work reports on analyses performed on a subset of the initial survey data by a joint Japan-U.S. collaboration to determine I-131 ground concentrations. The analytical results show a high concentration of I-131 northwest of the NPP, consistent with the previously reported radioactive cesium deposition, but also shows a significant I-131 concentration south of the plant, which was not observed in the original cesium analysis. The difference in the radioactive iodine and cesium patterns is possibly the result of differences in the ways these materials settle out of the air.

Skin contamination is one of the most probable risks following major nuclear or radiological incidents, but this risk also exists and incidents can happen in industry, research laboratories, or in nuclear medicine departments. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the products currently used after skin contamination in order to highlight the needs and ways to improve the medical management of victims. From this review, it can be observed that the current use of these radiological decontamination products is essentially based on empiricism. In addition, some of these products are harsh and irritating, even toxic, possibly damaging the skin barrier. In some emergency situations in which clean water is in short supply, most of the current products cannot be used. Research on the mechanisms of action of decontaminating products is needed to develop a decontamination strategy.

SPECIES-DEPENDENT EFFECTIVE CONCENTRATION OF DTPA IN PLASMA FOR CHELATION OF Am-241	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						DTPA; Am-241; chelation; decontamination	DECORPORATION; PLUTONIUM; EFFICACY; RADIONUCLIDE; AMERICIUM; FORMULATION; INJECTION; THERAPY; AGENTS; BLOOD	Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) is a chelating agent that is used to facilitate the elimination of radionuclides such as americium from contaminated individuals. Its primary site of action is in the blood, where it competes with various biological ligands, including transferrin and albumin, for the binding of radioactive metals. To evaluate the chelation potential of DTPA under these conditions, the competitive binding of Am-241 between DTPA and plasma proteins was studied in rat, beagle, and human plasma in vitro. Following incubation of DTPA and Am-241 in plasma, the Am-241-bound ligands were fractionated by ultrafiltration and ion-exchange chromatography, and each fraction was assayed for Am-241 content by gamma scintillation counting. Dose response curves of DTPA for Am-241 binding were established, and these models were used to calculate the 90% maximal effective concentration, or EC90, of DTPA in each plasma system. The EC90 were determined to be 31.4, 15.9, and 10.0 mu M in rat, beagle, and human plasma, respectively. These values correspond to plasma concentrations of DTPA that maximize Am-241 chelation while minimizing excess DTPA. Based on the pharmacokinetic profile of DTPA in humans, after a standard 30 mu mol kg(-1) intravenous bolus injection, the plasma concentration of DTPA remains above EC90 for approximately 5.6 h. Likewise, the effective duration of DTPA in rat and beagle were determined to be 0.67 and 1.7 h, respectively.

Radioactive gas production (mainly C-11, N-13, O-15, Ar-41) and release is one of the environmental protection program issues. U. S. DOE Order 458.1 requires that 40 CFR 61 Subpart H's NESHAP requirements be followed. These regulations prescribe a total dose limit of 0.1 mSv y(-1) to the Maximally Exposed Individual (MEI) of the general public, a requirement for a continuous air monitoring system if a release point within a facility can cause > 1 x 10(-3) mSv y(-1) to the MEI, and a requirement for periodic confirmatory measurements for minor sources which give releases that contribute > 1 x 10(-3) mSv y(-1) to the MEI. At SLAC, all air release points for current operations are evaluated to be minor sources. This paper describes SLAC's evaluation following NESHAP requirements; measurements using the Air Monitoring Station (AMS) as periodic confirmatory measurements are also discussed.

The primary goals in developing a replacement (the modified jar system) were to 1) maintain or improve collection efficiency while keeping leakage to less than 5%, 2) simplify the set-up process, and 3) reduce costs. Both the traditional glass column assembly and the modified jar system were operated in tandem for a 13-mo period. Results showed that the modified sample jar system provided equivalent or improved collection efficiency for both H-3 and C-14. Additional advantages included reduced leak-test errors, quicker and simpler set-up, and material costs that were reduced by nearly an order of magnitude.

Annual air emissions from both well characterized stack sources and difficult to characterize diffuse sources must be assessed. This paper describes a process that uses a mathematical optimization routine to find a set of estimated diffuse source terms that together with the measured stack source terms provides a best fit of modeled air concentrations to measured air concentrations at available sampling locations. The estimated and measured source terms may then be used in subsequent CAP88-PC modeling to estimate dose at the off-site maximally exposed individual. LLNL has found this process to be an effective way to deal with the required assessment of diffuse sources that have otherwise been difficult to assess.

At many facilities, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (U. S. EPA) requires that CAP88 be used to demonstrate compliance with air quality regulations for public protection from emissions of radionuclides. Gaussian plume models have the advantage of being relatively simple and their use pragmatic; however, these models are based on simplifying assumptions and generally they are not capable of incorporating dynamic meteorological conditions or complex topography. These limitations encourage validation tests to understand the capabilities and limitations of the model for the specific application. Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) has complex topography but is required to use CAP88 for compliance with the Clean Air Act Subpart H. The purpose of this study was to test the accuracy of the CAP88 predictions against ambient air measurements using released tritium as a tracer. Stack emissions of tritium from two LANL stacks were measured and the dispersion modeled with CAP88 using local meteorology. Ambient air measurements of tritium were made at various distances and directions from the stacks. Model predictions and ambient air measurements were compared over the course of a full year's data. Comparative results were consistent with other studies and showed the CAP88 predictions of downwind tritium concentrations were on average about three times higher than those measured, and the accuracy of the model predictions were generally more consistent for annual averages than for bi-weekly data.

The most significant of these changes from a user perspective are the incorporation of age-dependent radionuclide dose and risk factors for ingestion and inhalation, the increase in the number of included radionuclides, and a change in the file management system used by the program. Other changes less visible to the user include new code architecture, incorporation of numerical solvers for the calculation of radioactive decay chains, including the ingrowth of decay products during air transport and ground surface deposition, enhanced error messages, updated on-line help, and a utility for migrating Version 3 datasets, wind files, and population files to Version 4. The modifications have produced a significant improvement in speed and stability for Version 4 relative to Version 3 and eliminated the solution approximations used in Version 3. The U. S.

We argue that the ROK will run out of space for at-reactors spent fuel storage by about the year 2030 and will thus need to transition centralized dry cask storage. Pyroprocessing plant capacity, even if approved and successfully licensed and constructed by that time, will not suffice to handle all the spent fuel discharged annually. Hence centralized dry cask storage will be required even if the pyroprocessing option is successfully developed by 2030. Pyroprocessing is but an enabling technology on the path leading to fissile material recycling and burning in future SFRs. In this regard we discuss two SFR options under development in the U.S.: the Super Prism and the Travelling Wave Reactor (TWR). We note that the U.S. is further along in reactor development than the ROK. The ROK though has acquired more experience, recently in investigating fuel recycling options for SFRs. We thus call for two complementary joint R&D project to be conducted by U.S. and ROK scientists. One leading to the development of a demonstration centralized away-from-reactors spent fuel storage facility. The other involve further R&D on a combined SFR-fuel cycle complex based on the reactor and fuel cycle options discussed in the paper.

J	Baba, M				Baba, M.			Fukushima accident: What happened?	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article						Accident; Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant; Contamination; Recovery action; Radiation hazard		An overview is presented on the progression and the impact of the accident in the Fukushima-Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant based on the public information until December, 2011. The accident was caused by a loss of powers and heat sink for cooling which was triggered by a massive earthquake and a successive tsunami, and resulted in release of radioactive materials, similar to 15% of that in the Chernobyl, to environment and evacuation of residents around the plant. It should be noted that other ten reactors were also hit by the earthquake and tsunami but could reach cold shutdown owing to availability of cooling. Contamination of land and sea around the plant is so serious as that living and fishery are prohibited. Nevertheless, neither death due to radiation nor serious radiation exposure has been reported despite of various problems in the evacuation procedure and radiation management. Various actions which were undertaken to recover the plant and to reduce the radiation hazard to residents are also described. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The concentration of radioactivity in contaminated vegetables was higher than the value of the legal limit for shipment, therefore, we attempted to identify a simple and effective removal method for contaminated farm products to ensure the relief of farmers and the security of consumers. First, the radioactivity distribution and adhesion state of contaminated vegetables were investigated by an imaging plate (IP) image. As a result, there were two types of contamination, spot type or spread type, of vegetables. The removal of radioactivity by physical or chemical methods was investigated. As a result, radioactivity removal by water washing showed no significant difference between boiling water and cold water. There was no significant difference between hand washing and running water washing. The result of chemical removal showed that reducing agents removed radioactivity from vegetables by 70-80% for I-131 and more than 80% for Cs-137. In particular, ascorbic acid is promising as a safe and versatile option. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A rod of silver-activated phosphate glass was pulverized into micrometer-size particles. Spherical glass particles were formed from the pulverized glass particles in the high-temperature jet flame owing to the surface tension of the glass material. Some groups of spherical glass particles were irradiated with X-rays and their RPL was demonstrably observed for their exposure to UV light. A flexible RPL glass sheet was also made of bead-type RPL glass dosimeters and was useful for radiation imaging. Bead-type RPL glass dosimeters are expected to be used for dose monitoring in highly radioactively-contaminated area. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The documents were then examined by the authorities and their technical advisors, with substantial interaction between specialists from the ITER Organization and the nuclear regulator. Finally the examination has concluded with a positive advice to grant the decree to permit the creation of ITER, and to proceed to the next stage of licensing, during which a number of ongoing commitments will have to be fulfilled. In the course of the examination of the ITER safety files, a number of technical issues were visited These concerned the provisions in the design to mitigate potential hazards by the implementation of two safety functions: confinement of radioactive material and limitation of exposure to ionizing radiation. The robustness of the confinement systems that protect radioactive inventories had to be justified and their adequacy in all situations had to be demonstrated Potential challenges to the confinement, even in events regarded as extremely unlikely, had to be fully analyzed It also had to be shown that radioactive waste generated by the operation of ITER has a viable path for its safe storage and ultimate disposal. In this paper some of the key technical issues that form part of the ITER safety case are outlined, in the light of the discussions held during the regulatory examination of the files. Some of the issues outlined are the subject of ongoing actions to reach a final conclusion.

LIFE TRITIUM PROCESSING: A SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION FOR CLOSING THE FUSION FUEL CYCLE	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	20th American-Nuclear-Society (ANS) Topical Meeting on the Technology of Fusion Energy (TOFE)	AUG 27-31, 2012	Nashville, TN	Amer Nucl Soc (ANS), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, US ITER, Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Princeton Plasma Phys Lab, Naval Res Lab, Atom Energy Soc Japan, Canadian Nucl Soc, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers			HYDROGEN ISOTOPE-SEPARATION; ENERGY	The Laser Inertial Fusion Energy (LIFE) power plant is being designed to deliver a transformative source of safe, secure, sustainable electricity, in a time scale that is consistent with the global energy market needs. The LIFE market entry plant will demonstrate the feasibility of a closed fusion fuel cycle, including tritium breeding, extraction, processing, re-fueling, accountability and safety, in a steady-state power-producing device. While many fusion plant designs require large quantities of tritium for startup and operations, a range of design choices made for the LIFE fuel cycle act to reduce the in-process tritium inventory. The high fractional burn-up (similar to 30%) in an Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE) capsule relaxes the tritium breeding requirements, while the use of only milligram quantities of fuel per shot and choice of a pure lithium heat transfer fluid substantially reduce the amount of material entrained in the facility. Additionally, the high solubility of tritium in the lithium breeder is expected to mitigate the need for development of permeation barriers in the engine systems, normally required to control routine releases within the allowable regulatory limits. The present paper offers an overview of the design of the LIFE fuel cycle, including a summary of the technology development plan consistent with the delivery schedule of the LIFE market entry plant.

Preferential grain boundary corrosion along with a homogeneous dissolution was observed. In addition, Al2O3 was coated to prevent the surface recession of FMS. Al2O3 was deposited on FMS using an electron-beam evaporated physical vapor deposition. The as-coated layer was crystallized through a heat-treatment at above 950 degrees C for 2 h.

The goal is to develop a CAD-based multiphysics modeling capability so that FW/Divertor temperature and geometric features can be readily taken into consideration while tritium permeation to the primary coolant in a prototypical PFC can be more realistically addressed. This development began with the simulation of ion implantation experiments, validated against existing laboratory experimental results. Analysis shows that with ITER FW where Be is used as the plasma facing material, the low operating temperature, erosion, and the dwell time greatly hinder tritium bulk diffusion, permeation, and inventory accumulation. However, under DEMO high-temperature operating conditions, tritium can quickly diffuse through tungsten to structural material and reach a steady state inventory after a relatively short time. Additionally, its permeation to the coolant can be reduced when the Soret effect is considered. The findings and challenges of developing a 3-D predictive capability for tritium transport in a FW/Divertor PFC are discussed	[Ying, Alice; Liu, Haibo; Abdou, Mohamed] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA	Ying, A (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.	ying@fusion.ucla.edu					ANDREL R.

For the high temperature operation of self-cooled breeder blankets, the first wall is often designed to be less than I cm thick to reduce mechanical stresses and as a result will be subjected to bi-directional hydrogen permeation by two distinctive mechanisms; in one direction by edge plasma-driven and in the other direction by bred tritium gas-driven permeation. Using a laboratory-scale plasma device and a one-dimensional diffusion model, plasma-driven and gas-driven hydrogen permeation behavior has been investigated under some of the conditions relevant to FLiBe-employed blankets. For a 5mm F82H membrane, the plasma-driven permeation flux at similar to 500 degrees C and the gas-driven hydrogen permeation flux at similar to 350 degrees C have been measured to be of the orders of 10(13) H-atoms/cm(2)/s and 10(14) H-atoms/cm2/s, respectively. From these data one predicts that gas-driven permeation could dominate the hydrogen isotope transport through the first wall.

The extra barrier improves confinement of these materials and enhances safety of the facility. This paper describes some of the design challenges in designing double containment piping systems. There is also a brief review of a few operating experiences of double walled piping used with hazardous chemicals in different industries. The authors recommend approaches for the reliability analyst to use to quantify leakage from a double containment piping system in conceptual and more advanced designs. The paper also cites quantitative data that can be used to support such reliability analyses.

Full-Scale Hot Cell Test of an Acoustic Sensor Dedicated to Measurement of the Internal Gas Pressure and Composition of a LWR Nuclear Fuel Rod	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Acoustic measurements; acoustic transducer; nuclear instrumentation; nuclear fuel rod	RELEASE	A full-scale hot cell test of the internal gas pressure and composition measurement by an acoustic sensor was carried out successfully between 2008 and 2010 on irradiated fuel rods in the LECA-STAR facility at CADARACHE Centre. The acoustic sensor has been specially designed in order to provide a non-destructive technique to easily carry out the measurement of the internal gas pressure and gas composition (mainly Helium-Xenon mixture, with a small amount of Krypton) of a LWR nuclear fuel rod. This sensor has been achieved in 2007 and is now covered by an international patent. We performed the gas characterisation contained in irradiated fuel rods. The acoustic method accuracy is now +/- 5 bars on the pressure measurement result and +/- 0.3% on the evaluated gas composition. The results of the acoustic method were compared to puncture results (destructive sampling). Another significant conclusion is that the efficiency of the acoustic method is not altered by the irradiation time, and possible modification of the cladding properties. The sensor-operating characteristics have not been altered by a two-year exposure in the hot cell conditions. These results make it possible to demonstrate the feasibility of the technique on irradiated fuel rods. The transducer and the associated methodology are now operational.	[Ferrandis, J.

Usually, a system either uses an approach focusing on the simulations of every individual decay or an approach which simulates a large number of decays with a focus on correct overall statistics. The radioactive decay package presented in this work permits, for the first time, the use of both methods within the same simulation framework-Geant4. The accuracy of the statistical approach in our new package, RDM-extended, and that of the existing Geant4 per-decay implementation ( original RDM), which has also been refactored, are verified against the ENSDF database. The new verified package is beneficial for a wide range of experimental scenarios, as it enables researchers to choose the most appropriate approach for their Geant4-based application.

In order to properly estimate the quality of such simulations, knowledge of the accuracy of the decay simulation is required. We present a validation of the original Geant4 Radioactive Decay Module, which uses a per-decay sampling approach, and of an extended package for Geant4-based simulation of radioactive decays, which, in addition to being able to use a refactored per-decay sampling, is capable of using a statistical sampling approach. The validation is based on measurements of calibration isotope sources using a high purity Germanium (HPGe) detector; no calibration of the simulation is performed. For the considered validation experiment equivalent simulation accuracy can be achieved with per-decay and statistical sampling.

Fuzzy-Logic Radioisotope Identifier for Gamma Spectroscopy in Source Search	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Fuzzy logic; maximum likelihood fitting; nuclear detection; radioisotope identifier; source search	RAY SPECTRA; NEURAL-NETWORKS; ISOTOPE IDENTIFICATION; DETECTORS	Detection and identification of radioactive nuclear materials in urban searches can be fully performed with a portable gamma ray detector-spectrometer. Due to limited acquisition time and, as a consequence, low signal to noise ratio (SNR), development of fast and accurate real-time radioisotope identifier (RIID) algorithms is essential for automated source detection. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of fuzzy logic real-time radioisotope identification (FL-RIID) in several urban search scenarios. FL-RIID performance is tested on a database of searches consisting of injections of synthetic sources into experimental nuclear background spectra, acquired in one-second time intervals with a moving sodium iodide (NaI) gamma radiation detector-spectrometer. Performance of FL-RIID is benchmarked against that of maximum-likelihood (ML) fitting method. Demonstrated advantages of FL-RIID over ML in search applications include lower false alarm rate and faster execution time.

Comparison of correlation relations for determining the relative Pu-242 content in plutonium produced in the RT-1 plant at the Industrial Association Mayak	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The correlation relations for determining the Pu-242 mass fraction which are used in the MGA and FRAM computer codes are compared with the relations proposed in the present article for plutonium stored in the RT-1 plant of the Industrial Association Mayak. The need to determine the Pu-242 mass fraction using the correlations arises in nondestructive analysis of plutonium. The MGA and FRAM codes use correlations which are based on data on the isotopic composition of the plutonium that has accumulated in American reactors so that the possibility of using these codes for Russian plutonium must be checked. This check was based on an analysis of data obtained on more than 6000 isotopic compositions during certification of the RT-1 plutonium. A characteristic of the relation proposed in this article is that it takes account of the change in the isotopic composition of plutonium over time.	[Aleeva, T. B.; Bushuev, A. V.; Kozhin, A.

Safety assessment of a subsurface radwaste repository in the region of the Leningradskaya NPP	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The propagation of radioactive contamination in non-head, near-surface, water-bearing strata is modeled in order to analyze the safety of a possible subsurface radwaste repository in the region of the Leningradskaya NPP. The propagation of radioactive contamination along the top water-bearing complex formed by Quaternary and Lower Cambrian deposits is studied. A map model approximation is used. The main contamination components are assumed to be Cs-137, Sr-90, and Co-60. The propagation of contamination over 50 years is predicted. It is shown that the contamination of rocks by Cs-137, Sr-90, and Co-60 propagates only in the direct proximity of the section where they leak from the repository (at a distance not exceeding 10 meters).

Efficacy of separation potentials in cascade optimization	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article							MULTICOMPONENT ISOTOPE-SEPARATION; POWER	Cascade optimization according to the criterion of maximum elemental separation power determined using the separation potential is examined. It is found by means of a computational experiment and comparison with minimization of the total flux that different forms of the potentials, including their dependence on the separation factors, can be used for binary mixtures irrespective of the enrichment at the cascade steps.

Using microarray techniques, this study aims for a better understanding of whole blood response to low and high doses of IR. Materials and methods : Aliquots of peripheral blood samples were irradiated with 0, 0.05, and 1 Gy X-rays. RNA was isolated and prepared for microarray gene expression experiments. Bioinformatic approaches, i.e., univariate statistics and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were used for analyzing the data generated. Seven differentially expressed genes were selected for further confirmation using quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Results : Functional analysis of genes differentially expressed at 0.05 Gy showed the enrichment of chemokine and cytokine signaling. However, responsive genes to 1 Gy were mainly involved in tumor suppressor protein 53 (p53) pathways. In a second approach, GSEA showed a higher statistical ranking of inflammatory and immune-related gene sets that are involved in both responding and/or secretion of growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines. This indicates the activation of the immune response. Whereas, gene sets enriched at 1 Gy were 'classical' radiation pathways like p53 signaling, apoptosis, DNA damage and repair. Comparative RT-PCR studies showed the significant induction of chemokine-related genes (PF4, GNG11 and CCR4) at 0.05 Gy and DNA damage and repair genes at 1 Gy (DDB2, AEN and CDKN1A). Conclusions : This study moves a step forward in understanding the different cellular responses to low and high doses of X-rays. In addition to that, and in a broader context, it addresses the need for more attention to the risk assessment of health effects resulting from the exposure to low doses of IR.

Bone scintigraphy is a highly sensitive method for indicating disease in bone. Mechanical stimulation in the manner of whole-body vibration (WBV) appears beneficial to the maintenance and/or enhancement of skeletal mass in individuals. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of WBV on the biodistribution of the radiopharmaceutical [Tc-99m] methylene diphosphonate (Tc-99m-MDP) in Wistar rats. Materials and methods : In the biodistribution analysis, animals were anesthetized with sodium thiopental, the radiopharmaceutical Tc-99m-MDP was administered via ocular plexus and after 10 min the animals were submitted to vibration of 20 Hz (1 min) in an oscillatory platform. Following, the animals were sacrificed, the organs were isolated, the radioactivity determined in a well counter, and the percentages of radioactivity per gram (%ATI/g) in the organs were calculated. An unpaired t-test following Welch test (p < 0.05) was done for statistical analysis of the results. Results : The biodistribution was significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in kidney, bone, lung, stomach, prostate and bowel. Conclusion : The analysis of the results indicates that the vibration could produce metabolic alterations with influence in the uptake of the radiopharmaceutical Tc-99m-MDP in bone, stomach, bowel, prostate, kidney and bladder.

This leads to seismic stability concerns for the casks, in terms of their sliding and rocking. In this study, the seismic behaviors of the free-standing vertical cylindrical cask (VCC), which is widely used in existing dry storage facilities, are investigated. The explicit finite element code LS-DYNA was adopted to establish a 3D model of a free-standing VCC on a concrete pad that considered the frictional contact at the interface between them. Analyses of the seismic responses of the cylindrical cask at various values of the friction coefficient were performed. From the results, a borderline value for the friction coefficient, which differentiates the motion type of the cask at the onset of motion between sliding and rocking, was deduced, and it can be related to the ratio of radius to height of the cask. Additionally, the unfavorable nutation motion of the VCC, which usually follows the rocking motion and causes considerable horizontal displacement, is discussed. It can be concluded that the displacement potential of the VCC can be decreased by setting an appropriate friction coefficient to prevent this rocking motion during earthquakes.

Distribution of fission product residual decay heat in stratified core melt of LWR and its influence on sidewall heat flux	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							C-FPS DATABASE; MOLTEN CORIUM; RETENTION; CODE	The model of spatial distribution of fission product (FP) activity and decay heat in core melt of light water reactor under severe accident conditions is proposed. It is based on thermodynamical consideration of "U-Zr-O-Fe-FP" system as a two-phase (oxide and metallic) stratified melt. The thermochemistry of FP phase distribution, heat-mass transfer and radioactive transformations of similar to 100 isotopes of Cs, Mo, Ru, Ba, Sr, Zr, La, Ce, Eu, Nd, Nb and Sb are considered self-consistently. The calculations carried out with specially designed code FPMC (fission products-molten core) showed that up to 15-25% of decay heat may be released in the metallic phase of the melt. Estimation of this value is fundamentally important in simulations of heat and mass transfer in stratified melt, such as in-vessel melt retention and reactor lower head failure. For numerical assessment of the influence of decay heat spatial distribution in stratified molten pool on the lower head failure time the multivariate simulation of the later stage of large break loss-of-coolant accident in VVER-1000 reactor was carried out by SOCRAT and HEFEST codes coupled with FPMC.

The critical experiments, involving aqueous uranyl fluoride (UO2F2) solutions, filled in seven interacting cylinders, were performed in the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1955. A Monte-Carlo calculation model to be used with MCNP5 was now developed for the determination of the uncertainties and the effects of various uncertainties on the multiplication factor were studied. The evaluation of the benchmark was performed for validation of calculation techniques and comparison of calculation results with the experimental data. The sensitivity studies include parametric variations of material composition and geometry. The largest care was devoted to the determination of the U concentration levels in the fissile solution and its density since the original experimental data is scarce. Both parameters are also the biggest contributors to the overall uncertainty. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Strok, M; Smodis, B				Strok, Marko; Smodis, Borut			Soil-to-plant transfer factors for natural radionuclides in grass in the vicinity of a former uranium mine	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							SAMPLES	The activity concentrations of U-238, Th-230, Ra-226 and Pb-210 were determined in soil and grass samples collected from sites at the uranium mill tailings waste pile, which lies near the former uranium mine at Zirovski vrh in Slovenia. Soil-to-plant transfer factors were determined and the potential use of grass as a monitor of radionuclide migration from the waste pile was evaluated. It was found that grass was not suitable for monitoring Th-230 and Pb-210 migration (no linear correlation between soil and grass activity concentrations) but has potential in predicting U-238 and Ra-226 migration (linear correlation between soil and grass activity concentrations). Soil-to-plant transfer factors for grass were in the range from 0.0014 to 0.015 kg/kg DM for U-238, 0.0039 to 0.012 kg/kg DM for Th-230, 0.035 to 0.46 kg/kg DM for Ra-226 and 0.098 to 1.5 kg/kg DM for Pb-210.

A MARKET-CLEARING MODEL OF THE URANIUM AND ENRICHMENT INDUSTRIES	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						market simulation; uranium supply; secondary supply		A market-clearing model of the uranium and enrichment industries through 2030 is presented. Built around thorough databases of primary and secondary uranium supplies as well as enrichment facilities, the model derives market-clearing conditions by locating the intersections between the annual supply-and-demand curves for uranium and enrichment services. Considering the effects of secondary supplies including highly enriched and natural uranium inventories along with depleted uranium enrichment, the model solves embedded optimization problems to account for trade-offs between uranium and enrichment requirements. The model can Worm policy decisions tied to uranium inventory management and sale and market effects of purchase and disbursement from a uranium bank. This paper documents the methodologies behind the model, describes a stochastic implementation to propagate uncertainties, and contrasts its forecasts to static projections. Further, it is applied to an illustrative reference case featuring moderate (2.6%/yr) demand growth for reactor fuel. The model predicts near-level uranium prices with declining separative work unit prices and enrichment tails assays through the mid-2020s. This behavior is largely driven by the coming online of several new centrifuge enrichment plants and capacity expansions at others, which encourages more aggressive tails assays while suppressing uranium requirements.

However, from a criticality safety point of view, such high enrichment levels would entail considerable modification of most facilities and equipment, which would require a significant investment. Erbia-credit super-high-burnup fuel offers the potential for an effective solution to this problem. The fuel is based on the concept that small amounts of erbia added to the entire amount of UO2 powder can reduce the reactivity level to less than that observed at a 5 wt% enrichment level, thus eliminating the majority of the modifications mentioned above. In this paper, a feasibility assessment from the viewpoint of fuel cycle economics is performed to confirm the benefits of erbia-credit-fuel implementation. A simple model to consider the erbia penalty is also proposed. The results show that the generation cost can be significantly reduced by using erbia credit, although the fuel cycle cost would not necessarily decrease in any of the cases when the enrichment level is increased. In addition, implementation scenarios of erbia credit are discussed considering the current industrial situation and the reactivity penalty incurred by the usage of erbia fuel. These implementation scenarios are also considered from the viewpoint of energy security.

FAILURE PROBABILITY EVALUATION OF A NEAR-SURFACE RADIOACTIVE WASTE REPOSITORY DUE TO WATER INFILTRATION	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						waste disposal; repository; failure probability		This paper aims to determine, for the period of institutional control (300 yr), the probability of occurrence of the net release scenario of radioactive waste from a near-surface repository. The radioactive waste focused on in this work is that of low and medium activity generated by a pressurized water reactor plant. The repository is divided into eight modules, each of which consists of six barriers (top cover, upper layer, packages, base, walls, and geosphere). The repository is a system where the modules work in series and the module barriers work in active parallel. The module failure probability for radioactive elements is obtained from a Markov model because of shared loads assumed for the different barriers. Lack of field failure data led to the necessity of performing sensitivity analyses to assess the failure rate impact on module and barrier failure probabilities. Module failure probabilities have been found to be lower for those radioactive elements with higher retardation coefficients. The geosphere mean time to failure is the most important parameter for calculating module failure probabilities for each radioactive element. The repository module has presented higher failure probabilities for iodine, technetium, and strontium. For iodine, the estimated probability is 16% for 300 yr and 96% for 1000 yr. The basis for performance evaluation of the deposition system is the understanding of its gradual evolution. There are many uncertainty sources in this modeling, and efforts in this direction are strongly recommended.	[Aguiar, L.

A close observation of the coastal villages specifically revealed high background radioactivity in 14 coastal villages. A very high intrinsic anomalous radioactivity of 41.03 Sv h(1) was observed, in a famous tourist spot in the coastal belt of Kanyakumari District. This is the highest level of radiation registered in South India, which is extremely higher than the permissible world average and is suggestive of causing severe clinical problems on continuous and prolonged exposure.

No significant enhancement of surface soil radioactivity levels in the vicinity of lignite-fired plants was observed. A downcore decreasing trend of Cs-137 was observed in a number of cores reflecting its atmospheric origin, whereas the uniform distribution observed in a number of other cores gave information on the mechanical alteration of the soil. The average dose rate value was found to be 63 22 nGy h(1), while the annual average effective dose from the terrestrial gamma radiation was found to be 0.08 0.03 mSv.	[Papaefthymiou, H.

These locations form the agriculturally important regions of Egypt. The study area has many industries such as chemical, paper, organic fertilisers and construction materials, and the soils of the study region are used as a construction material. Therefore, it becomes necessary to study the natural radioactivity levels in soil to assess the dose for the population in order to know the health risks. The activity concentrations of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 in the soil ranged from 5.7 0.3 to 140 7, from 9.0 0.4 to 139 7 and from 22 1 to 319 16 Bq kg(1), respectively. The absorbed dose rate, annual effective dose rate, radium equivalent (R-eq), excess lifetime cancer risk, hazard indices (H-ex and H-in) and annual gonadal dose equivalent, which resulted from the natural radionuclides in the soil were calculated.

Committed effective dose determination in southern Brazilian cereal flours	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							GAMMA-RAY SPECTROMETRY; JOS-PLATEAU; RADIOACTIVITY; FOODSTUFFS; AREA; K-40	The health impact of radionuclide ingestion from foodstuffs was evaluated by the committed effective doses determined in eight commercial samples of South-Brazilian cereal flours (soy, wheat, cornmeal, cassava, rye, oat, barley and rice flours). The radioactivity traces of Th-228, Ra-228, Ra-226, K-40, Be-7 and Cs-137 were measured by gamma-ray spectrometry employing an HPGe detector of 66 relative efficiency. The efficiency curve has taken into account the differences in densities and chemical composition between the matrix and the certified sample. The highest concentration levels of Th-228 and K-40 were 3.50.4 and 146917 Bq kg(1) for soy flour, respectively, within the 95 confidence level. The lower limit of detection for Cs-137 ranged from 0.04 to 0.4 Bq kg(1). The highest committed effective dose was 0.36 Sv.y(1) for Ra-228 in cassava flour (adults).

Natural radioactivity measurements of beach sands in Gran Canaria, Canary Islands (Spain)	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							GAMMA-EMITTING RADIONUCLIDES; ANTHROPOGENIC RADIONUCLIDES; RED-SEA; COAST; SAMPLES; INDIA; SPECTROMETRY; ENVIRONMENT; SEDIMENTS; REGION	Concentrations of natural radionuclides Ra-226, Th-232, K-40 and man-made Cs-137 in most important tourist Gran Canaria beaches have been determined using a high-purity Germanium detector to analyse their radiological hazard. Average values of the activity concentrations of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 were 17.61.4, 21.31.8 and 48022 Bq kg(1), respectively. Observed activity concentration values of Cs-137 were practically negligible from a radiological protection point of view. The results of this paper were compared with others published in the bibliography for beaches and coastal sediments of different countries. The mean external air absorbed dose rate was 43.92.8 nGyh(1), which resulted in an outdoor annual effective dose below the world average. Also, the radium equivalent and the external hazard index were calculated. Results from Gran Canaria beaches showed the low levels of radioactivity, indicating no significant radiological risk related to human activities in the area.	[Arnedo, M. A.; Tejera, A.; Rubiano, J.

In addition, the self-attenuation of the source matrix, the attenuation by the source container and the detector housing materials were considered in the mathematical treatment. Results were compared with those measured by a cylindrical NaI (Tl) detector with resolution (FWHM) at 662 keV equal to 7.5 . Eu-152 aqueous radioactive spherical sources covering the energy range from 121 to 1408 keV were used. In comparison, the calculated and the measured full-energy peak efficiency values were in good agreement.

J	Rani, A; Singh, S; Duggal, V				Rani, Asha; Singh, Surinder; Duggal, Vikas			Indoor radon measurements in the dwellings of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, India	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							PLASTIC TRACK DETECTORS; SEASONAL-VARIATIONS; LUNG-CANCER; EXPOSURE; URANIUM; AREAS	The measurement of indoor radon concentrations were performed in the dwellings of the Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, India by using LR-115 type II Solid-State Nuclear Track Detectors in the bare mode. The annual average indoor radon concentrations in the dwellings are found to vary from 114 to 400 Bq m(3) with an average of 194 Bq m(3). In 22 of the dwellings the indoor radon activity concentration values lies in the range of action level (200300 Bq m(3)) and in 11 of the dwellings above the upper limit of action level recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). The annual effective dose (AED) varies from 2.88 to 10.08 mSv with an average of 4.88 mSv. In most of the villages, the AED lies in the range of action level (310 mSv) recommended by the ICRP. The seasonal variation in indoor radon reveals the maximum values in winter and minimum in summer. The winter/summer ratio of indoor radon ranges from 1.15 to 1.62 with an average of 1.31.
