Factors affecting the quality of plutonium deposits by electrodeposition	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Electrodeposition; Alpha spectrometry; Plutonium; Resolution	ALPHA-SPECTROMETRY; ENERGY RESOLUTION; AMERICIUM; SPECTROSCOPY; OPTIMIZATION; ACTINIDES; URANIUM	Ultra-high resolution alpha spectrometry by microcalorimetry has demonstrated a dramatic improvement in alpha energy resolution over silicon based detectors. To characterize the optimal resolution obtained by the microcalorimeter alpha spectrometers, high quality deposits that are virtually massless are required; electrodeposition is the preferred method for the preparation of high quality deposits. In order to better understand the factors that contribute to lower alpha energy resolution and deposit yield, we have conducted a study to determine the effect of some of the parameters that are used for preparing electrodeposits. We have compared four different electrodeposition methods and four different substrate materials to determine the effect on the deposit yield and alpha energy resolution of plutonium as measured by full width at half maximum using silicon based detectors. Furthermore, we wanted to understand the effect of contaminants from environmental samples on electrodeposits. Therefore, the effect on deposit yield and alpha energy resolution with several common soil constituents (Al-3+, Eu3+, Fe3+, K+, Lu3+, Mg2+, Na+, Zn2+) have been studied.	[Bond, E. M.; Moody, W.

Non-volatile organic analysis of uranium ore concentrates	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Uranium ore concentrate; Sorptive extraction; Twister (R) stir bar; GC-MS; Nuclear forensics	BAR SORPTIVE EXTRACTION; SOLVENT-EXTRACTION; SULFATE; MEDIA	In support of nuclear safeguards and nonproliferation efforts, Oak Ridge National Laboratory is responsible for characterizing uranium ore concentrate (UOC) samples obtained from two ore mining and milling sites. A sorptive extraction method has been developed for analysis of non-volatile organic compounds that might be used to identify characteristics of the purification process by which uranium was separated from these ores. This method utilizes Gerstel Twister (R) stir bars coated with polydimethylsiloxane to extract organic components from aqueous media. A slurry of UOC is extracted with the Twister (R) stir bar in 20 % methanol/80 % water containing deuterated internal hydrocarbon standards. Following extraction of non-volatile organics, the Twister (R) stir bar is analyzed directly in the inlet of a gas chromatograph fitted with a quadrupole mass spectrometric detector. Results have been consistent and have shown excellent recoveries of internal standards, with the average recovery being 97.5 %. Both qualitative and quantitative differences have been identified between the two sources of UOC utilizing this method. One source contained an increased concentration of amines which commonly are used in the recovery and purification of ores. Amines that were identified in this UOC source include dioctylamine, triisoctylamine, and Alamine (R) 336, a common industrial complexant. Also, when comparing both sources, the same UOC source contained various decanol and C20 compounds. Based on the results from this study, non-volatile organic analysis of UOC using sorptive extraction with Twister (R) stir bars and GC-MS is a tool that can be used to facilitate sourcing of unknown UOC.

Digital pulse-shape discrimination applied to an ultra-low-background gas-proportional counting system: first results	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Signal processing; Pulse-shape discrimination; Proportional counter; Tritium; Carbon-14; Biofuel; Low background		A new ultra-low-background proportional counter design was recently developed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). This design, along with an ultra-low-background counting system which provides passive and active shielding with radon exclusion, has been developed to complement a new shallow underground laboratory (similar to 30 m water-equivalent) constructed at PNNL. After these steps to mitigate dominant backgrounds (cosmic rays, external gamma-rays, radioactivity in materials), remaining background events do not exclusively arise from ionization of the proportional counter gas. Digital pulse-shape discrimination (PSD) is thus employed to further improve measurement sensitivity. In this work, a template shape is generated for each individual sample measurement of interest, a "self-calibrating" template. Differences in event topology can also cause differences in pulse shape. In this work, the temporal region analyzed for each event is refined to maximize background discrimination while avoiding unwanted sensitivity to event topology. This digital PSD method is applied to sample and background data, and initial measurement results from a biofuel methane sample are presented in the context of low-background measurements currently being developed.

New concepts for radiometric measurements of environmental samples	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Environmental sampling; Radiometric; Coincidence signatures; Plutonium	PLUTONIUM; PACIFIC; SEA; RADIONUCLIDES; GREENLAND; THULE	The Radiation Detection and Nuclear Sciences Group at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has a long history in conducting measurements of radioisotopes for various applications. This experience includes ultra-low background measurements, arrays of germanium detectors, automated sampling and measurement systems and coincidence measurement systems. A recent lab-supported effort has been studying how these capabilities, both in terms of hardware and experience, can be leveraged to enable environmental sampling measurements. One area of interest is the release of fission products and actinides into the environment from a reactor incident. While the initial survey of this area is still under way, one isotope of interest that surfaced early in the study is Pu-238. Existing techniques to assay this isotope suffer from measurement challenges. In alpha counting, there can be significant interference with Am-241, while in mass spectrometry, there can be interference with U-238. The authors are developing the concept for a detector that through coincidence counting techniques can distinguish Pu-238 and Am-241. In addition, we will design the system to conduct radiometric measurements of other plutonium isotopes to enable a direct comparison of those isotopes. We will present our concept of the detector system for Pu-238, as well as discuss other radiometric measurements of fission products and actinides with which we intend to advance the state of the art for environmental measurements.

J	White, TL; DiPrete, D; DiPrete, C; Dobos, G				White, Thomas L.; DiPrete, David; DiPrete, Cecilia; Dobos, Gary			Analysis of Cl-36 in Savannah River Site radioactive waste	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Chloride; Radioactive waste; Gas flow proportional counting; Neutron activation analysis	I-129; FUEL	Radioactive waste cleanup and subsequent closure of waste storage tanks is currently underway at the Savannah River Site, prompting the need to characterize the residual contents (heels) of the tanks. Each tank heel has variable chemical constituents and radiological distributions that pose unique analyte characterization and quantification challenges. For example, similar target detection limits for each tank heel are often difficult to meet as a result of complex matrices and methods must be tailored to characterize each new tank heel to the level of detection required. Furthermore, continuous programmatic evaluations of allowable closed-tank radiological inventories result in steadily decreasing detection limit targets for many of the isotopes required for characterization. Some of the target isotopes required for characterization need to be quantified to levels approaching 10 orders of magnitude below the radioactive concentrations of interfering isotopes. One particularly troublesome target analyte is Cl-36. As a pure beta-emitting radionuclide, Cl-36 (T-1/2= 3.01 x 10(5) +/- 3,000 years) must be isolated from interfering beta-emitting radionuclides such as Sr-90, Y-90, Cs-137, Tc-99, and C-14, as well as actinides and lanthanides prior to quantification. Due to its half-life, the target detection limit for Cl-36 is extremely low compared to the concentrations of other beta-emitting radionuclides typically present in residual tank solids. A method of analysis for Cl-36 was developed which utilizes a combination of traced acid digestion of radioactive waste tank samples followed by aggressive decontamination of interfering beta-emitting radionuclides via repeated resin-strikes, distillation, precipitation as AgCl, and analysis by gas flow proportional counting for the Cl-36-containing precipitate. The separation is traced by neutron activation analysis of stable chloride imparted during the initial digestion, and results are corrected for the separation yield. Recent campaigns have successfully achieved interference-free AgCl precipitates and, ultimately, detection limits of 0.37 Bq/g from matrices containing similar to 1E7 Bq/g of other beta-emitting radionuclides.

Concentration of dissolved forms of cesium in large seawater samples (about 100 L) was performed using composite absorbers AMP-PAN and KNiFC-PAN with ammonium molybdophosphate and potassium-nickel hexacyanoferrate( II) as active components, respectively, and polyacrylonitrile as a binding polymer. A specially designed chromatography column with bed volume (BV) 25 mL allowed fast flow rates of seawater (up to 1,200 BV h(-1)). The recovery yields were determined by ICP-MS analysis of stable cesium added to seawater sample. Both absorbers proved usability for cesium concentration from large seawater samples. KNiFC-PAN material was slightly more effective in cesium concentration from acidified seawater (recovery yield around 93 % for 700 BV h(-1)). This material showed similar efficiency in cesium concentration also from natural seawater.

Production of double-sided targets by electrodeposition: initial evaluation and optimization of performance	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						DANCE; Electrodeposition; Uranium; Molecular plating	DANCE	The Detector for Advanced Neutron Capture Experiments (DANCE) located at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center is used to perform neutron capture cross-section measurements on radioactive and non-radioactive isotopes. Thin actinide targets for the DANCE detector are typically prepared by molecular deposition on thin titanium foils. For the preparation of double-sided deposits, a Teflon electrodeposition cell was constructed with two liquid chambers with a foil substrate in between, allowing electrodeposition on both sides of the foil. We have been studying the electrodeposition of uranium from isopropyl alcohol solutions using this cell. Effects of acid composition, uranium concentration, current, and deposition time will be described.	[Bond, E. M.; Moody, W. A.; Bredeweg, T.

J	Bowen, J; Glover, S; Spitz, H				Bowen, James; Glover, Samuel; Spitz, Henry			Morphology of actinide-rich particles released from the BOMARC accident and collected from soil post remediation	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						BOMARC; Plutonium; Uranium; Scanning electron microscopy; Soil	PALOMARES ACCIDENT; PLUTONIUM; GREENLAND; SPAIN; THULE; URANIUM	The physical, chemical, and radiological characteristics of material released to the environment from accidents involving nuclear weapon components are dependent upon many factors, especially the manner in which the material is released and delivered to the environment. These characteristics will also be influenced by physical and chemical effects associated with weathering if the material remains exposed to the environment for a long period of time. This study evaluates the morphological characteristics of particles released to the environment as a result of the 1960 BOMARC incident and compares these characteristics to those described following similar incidents at Thule, Greenland (1968) and Palomares, Spain (1966). Each of these incidents involved unique circumstances and conditions that distributed actinide-rich particles to the environment with a range of distinctive morphological characteristics. Morphological and surface elemental analyses were conducted on a set of discrete particles isolated from samples of post-remediated soil collected at McGuire Air Force Base, the site of the BOMARC incident. Scanning electron microscopy and complimentary energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were used to perform the analyses. Non-destructive analysis of uranium and plutonium contained in each particle was measured using high-resolution gamma spectrometry. Unique characteristics of the BOMARC samples include some particles exhibiting a smooth, crystalline texture and varying elemental surface distribution of uranium and plutonium, dependent on the particle's morphology.

Rapid quantification of TBP and TBP degradation product ratios by FTIR-ATR	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Tributyl phosphate; FTIR-ATR; Nuclear forensics; Hydrolysis	PHOSPHATE	Tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP) is the key complexant within the plutonium and uranium reduction extraction process used to extract uranium and plutonium from used nuclear fuel. During reprocessing TBP degrades to dibutyl phosphate (DBP), butyl acid phosphate (MBP), butanol, and phosphoric acid over time. A method for rapidly monitoring TBP degradation is needed for the support of nuclear forensics. Therefore, a Fourier transform infrared spectrometry-attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) technique was developed to determine approximate peak intensity ratios of TBP and its degradation products. The technique was developed by combining variable concentrations of TBP, DBP, and MBP to simulate TBP degradation. This method is achieved by analyzing selected peak positions and peak intensity ratios of TBP and DBP at different stages of degradation. The developed technique was tested on TBP samples degraded with nitric acid. In mock degradation samples, the 1,235 cm(-1) peak position shifts to 1,220 cm(-1) as the concentration of TBP decreases and DBP increases. Peak intensity ratios of TBP positions at 1,279 and 1,020 cm(-1) relative to DBP positions at 909 and 1,003 cm(-1) demonstrate an increasing trend as the concentration of DBP increases. The same peak intensity ratios were used to analyze DBP relative to MBP whereas a decreasing trend is seen with increasing DBP concentrations. The technique developed from this study may be used as a tool to determine TBP degradation in nuclear reprocessing via a rapid FTIR-ATR measurement without gas chromatography analysis.

However, less information is available on the background levels of other isotopes such as Xe-133 and Xe-131m produced via spontaneous fission of either manmade or naturally occurring elements. The background concentrations of radioxenon in the subsurface are important to understand because these isotopes potentially can be used to confirm violations of the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty during an on-site inspection. Recently, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory measured radioxenon concentrations from the subsurface at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site (NNSS-formerly known as the Nevada Test Site) to determine whether xenon isotope background levels could be detected from spontaneous fission of naturally occurring uranium or legacy Pu-240 as a result of historic nuclear testing. In this paper, we discuss the results of those measurements and review the sources of xenon background that must be taken into account during OSI noble gas measurements.	[Hayes, J. C.; Bowyer, T.

Parallel radioisotope collection and analysis in response to the Fukushima release	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Fukushima; Radionuclide; Atmospheric aerosol sampling	TEST BAN TREATY; NUCLEAR ACCIDENT; CTBT; NETWORK; STATION	Two independent radionuclide aerosol air samplers were operated at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in close proximity during the Fukushima reactor releases. One system was an automated aerosol collection and analysis unit, whereas the other was a manual sampler of simpler design. The samples collected from each sampler showed correlation in radionuclide activity, although some variations were observed. During this unique event, the small variations observed between the co-located air samplers illustrate the effectiveness of a way to acquire useful parallel samples for scientific purposes. The results in radionuclide activity concentration show that, in some circumstances, use of a manual high volume air sampler in parallel to a complex automated sampler can produce results that are of comparable quality to International Monitoring System samples.

Radiochemical and mass spectrometric analysis of the surface oxide coating of modest collections of rusty nails retrieved from remote locations provides a global fallout plutonium signal of up to 2 x 10(10) atoms of Pu-239 per sample. The median Pu-239 measurement for 10 samples from five locations was 2.82 x 10(9) atoms.

Xe-135 production from Cf-252	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Radioactive gas; Radioactive standards; Spontaneous fission; Gas chromatography		The presence of Xe-135 is often used as an indicator that fission has occurred, and is used to help enforce the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. There are no known commercial suppliers, though it can be acquired. Readily available standards of this isotope are very useful. Xe-135 can be produced through fission, or by neutron capture on Xe-134. At the INL, scientists have previously transported fission products from an electroplated Cf-252 thin source for the measurement of nuclear data of short-lived fission products using a technique called He-Jet collection. A similar system has been applied to the collection of gaseous Xe-135, and Xe-133, in order to produce standards of these isotopes.

Mixed diets and foodstuffs are measured within a monitoring program according to the Austrian radiation protection law, food law, and the Commission Recommendation 2000/473/Euratom on the application of Article 36 of the Euratom Treaty concerning the monitoring of the levels of radioactivity in the environment for the purpose of assessing the exposure of the population as a whole. In addition, drinking and mineral water samples are measured for natural and artificial radionuclides. The ingestion dose for the Austrian population is recalculated based on the results of these measurements, literature data, and the data of the new report on food habits. In general, the major part of the ingestion dose is caused by natural radionuclides, especially K-40.

In vitro dissolution of uranyl acetate using different methods	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Dissolution rate; Uranyl acetate; Dialysis; Simulated lung fluid	URANIUM	The dissolution rate of a material in the lung is an important parameter in evaluating the risk to humans following accidental inhalation of a substance and is also a parameter that may be useful in characterizing particles for nuclear forensics analysis. Conventional methods of measuring dissolution rates in vitro involve exposing the material or particles to a solvent, such as water, saline, or solutions that simulate lung fluid, and measuring the fraction of material that dissolves with time. A new device for measuring dissolution rates for small samples, especially individual particles, was evaluated that incorporates a regenerated cellulose dialysis membrane fixed to the bottom of a small, 2 mL plastic cup that fits into the top of a 50 mL plastic centrifuge tube. The cup is easily transferred among a series of tubes containing solvent to measure rate of dissolution. The dialysis membrane has a diffusion rating of 20 kDa molecular weight cut off which greatly exceeds the size of the dissolved uranium molecule. The performance of the dialysis cup device was evaluated by measuring the dissolution rate of uranyl acetate in distilled water, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and simulated lung fluid (SLF). These results were compared to the dissolution rate measured using the traditional filter sandwich method in which a sample is sealed between two hydrophilic membranes. Although the majority of uranyl acetate dissolved in SLF within 30 min using the filter sandwich method, most of the uranyl acetate was undissolved in PBS and SLF using the dialysis membrane device. Reactions between the dissolved uranyl acetate, solvent, and the dialysis membrane likely caused the membrane to swell, shrinking the pore size, and thus reducing the transport of dissolved uranium across the membrane. Use of the dialysis cup device for evaluating dissolution rates for uranium-bearing materials in solvents containing a high concentration of salts is therefore not recommended.

The design, construction, and initial characterization of an ultra-low-background gas-proportional counting system	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Ultra-low-background; Proportional counters; Shallow underground laboratory; Counting system		Over the past several years, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has developed an ultra-low-background proportional counter (ULBPC) technology. The resulting detector is the product of an effort to produce a low-background, physically robust gas proportional counter for applications like radon emanation measurements, groundwater tritium, and Ar-37. In order to fully take advantage of the inherent low-background properties designed into the ULBPC, a comparably low-background dedicated counting system is required. An ultra-low-background counting system (ULBCS) was recently built in the new shallow underground laboratory at PNNL. With a design depth of 30 m water-equivalent, the shallow underground laboratory provides approximately 100x fewer fast neutrons and 6x fewer muons than a surface location. The ULBCS itself provides additional shielding in the form of active anti-cosmic veto (via 2-in-thick plastic scintillator paddles) and passive borated poly (1 in.), lead (6 in.), and copper (similar to 3 in.) shielding. This work will provide details on PNNL's new shallow underground laboratory, examine the motivation for the design of the counting system, and provide results from the characterization of the ULBCS, including initial detector background.

Kinetic phosphorescence analysis (KPA) is a technique that provides rapid, accurate, and precise determination of uranium concentration in aqueous solutions. Utilizing a pulsed-laser source to excite an aqueous solution of uranium, this technique measures the phosphorescent emission intensity over time to determine the phosphorescence decay profile. The phosphorescence intensity at the onset of decay is proportional to the uranium concentration in the sample. Calibration with uranium standards results in the accurate determination of actual concentration of the sample. Different isotopes of uranium, however, have unique properties which should result in different phosphorescence decay rates seen via KPA. Results show that a KPA is capable of resolving uranium isotopes.

Described herein is a series of studies undertaken to (1) survey a variety of low latent uranium content sampling media for efficacy of collecting nuclear materials and (2) compare active collection of particulates to swipe sampling. Findings from the evaluation of 40 natural and synthetic woven swipes will be presented. Results from a joint Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) project wherein a variety of passive deposition surfaces and active collections were examined for efficacy of sampling uranium processing effluents will also be detailed. For the swipe material evaluation portion of this work, uranium (U) particulate collection efficiency was evaluated on woven materials as-received and coated with complexants/solvents. The relative merits of each sampling matrix were reviewed on the basis of: (1) latent U background, (2) ease of separating the swipe material from the nuclear components, (3) presence of isobaric interferences from the swipe, and (4) efficiency in collecting uranium from contaminated surfaces. The second series of experiments evaluated the collection characteristics of active aerosol collection versus swipe sampling. ORNL and SRNL are collaborating on the development of the next generation of ES equipment for air grab and constant samples that could become an important addition to the international nuclear safeguards inspector's toolkit. Described herein are findings from the evaluation of collection efficiency of swipe sampling and active collection using an aerosol contaminant extractor (ACE) developed by SRNL.

This characterization is based primarily on I-129 measurements on samples collected from a research cruise conducted in waters off the eastern coast of Japan in June 2011. These measurements were compared with samples intended to reflect pre-Fukushima background that were collected during a May 2011 transect of the Pacific by a commercial container vessel. In surface waters, we observed peak I-129 concentrations of similar to 300 mu Bq/m(3) which represents an elevation of nearly three orders of magnitude compared to pre-Fukushima backgrounds. We coupled our I-129 results with Cs-137 measurements from the same cruise and derived an average I-129/Cs-137 activity ratio of 0.442 x 10(-6) for the effluent from Fukushima. Finally, we present I-129 depth profiles from five stations from this cruise which form the basis for future studies of ocean transport and mixing process as well as estimations of the total budget of I-129 released into the Pacific.

The principle of PGAA technique is based on detection of captured gamma-ray emitted from an analytical sample while being irradiated with neutrons. Use of a cold neutron beam guide greatly reduces the gamma-ray background at the analytical sample while maintaining a neutron capture rate is comparable to that of standard thermal neutron PGAA. A new cold neutron induced prompt gamma activation analysis (CN-PGAA) system has been under construction since April of 2009 at the HANARO Cold Neutron Building (KAERI, Republic of KOREA). In this study, the Compton suppression factor of the CN-PGAA system was estimated to be 5.5 using a Co-60 radioactive source in conjunction with the MCNPX simulations. Several parameters of the CN-PGAA system were studied to estimate and optimize the performance of the system: scintillation material in the guarded detector of a Compton suppression spectrometer (CSS); the relative positions of the HPGe detector and annular detector; and the distance between the HPGe detector and back catcher BGO detectors of the CSS. In addition, the neutron ray-trace simulation package, McStas, was adopted to predict the neutron flux and wavelength distribution at the end of the cold neutron beam guide. These results served as input for the MCNPX simulation of the CN-PGAA system.

Fission product separation from seawater by electrocoagulation method	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Electrocoagulation; Seawater; Fission product; Ion exchange; Fukushima nuclear power station; Decontamination	POTASSIUM NICKEL HEXACYANOFERRATE(II); THERMAL-STABILITY	At the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station, seawater was urgently injected into the reactor core. Therefore a large amount of seawater containing highly radioactive fission products (FP) accumulated and its treatment has been a serious problem. FP such as Cs, Sr and I in water are generally removed by an ion exchanger such as zeolite and separated with column or chemical precipitation methods. An alternative electrocoagulation method, which efficiently separates fine particles from the liquid phase without a chemical reagent is expected to be part of a useful separation system that can reduce the amount of waste, decrease processing time and simplify the process. In this study, powdered adsorbents, such as ferrocyanide and zeolite, were added to seawater containing simulated FP, and the electrocoagulation effect with Al alloy electrodes were investigated. More than 99 % of Cs and 90 % of I were removed by potassium nickel hexacyanoferrate(II) and silver zeolite, respectively. Sedimentation was promoted by electrocoagulation and addition of an inorganic cohesion promoter further increased the sedimentation rate. Moreover, rapid dissolution reaction with heating of the aggregation substance was not observed, so the thermal risk of aqueous processing of it would be low. In addition, thermal analyses showed that the electrocoagulation process did not lead to thermal decomposition. Therefore, if the electrocoagulation method is applied to a decontamination system, it has the potential to thermally stabilize and reduce waste.

The deposition of radioactive Cs was found as spots at the surface of the leaves, branch or trunk of the trees, as well as in soil using one of the imaging method, autoradiography. The deposited radioactive Cs was not easily washed out, even with the treatment of acid solution. When the wheat was harvested 2 months after the accident, high radioactivity of Cs was found only on the leaves developed and expanded at the time of the accident. In the case of the rice grain, most of the radioactivity was found in bran and the radioactivity was drastically reduced in milled rice. Most of the radioactive Cs accumulation in rice plants was estimated from the absorption of the Cs ion dissolved in water, rather than Cs adsorbed in soil.	[Nakanishi, T. M.; Kobayashi, N.

The radioactive sources in the construction stuffs and components of the reactor such as pressure tubes, steam generators must be evaluated for the estimation of the appropriate expense for the decommissioning. Unfortunately we do not have exact information about the initial composition of the pressure tubes. In this study the elemental contents of Nb and Zr in the activated zircaloy pressure tubes was investigated. Nb is one of the important elements that characterize the physical and mechanical properties of the pressure tube and a major source of high radioactivity. The prepared samples were strongly irradiated again in the vertical irradiation channel at the HANARO research reactor in the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) and then measured by an HPGe detector.

Radiometric detector options to aid in DOE high activity waste tank in situ characterization efforts	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Tank closure; Radiometric; Probe; Amptek		Radioactive waste cleanup and subsequent closure of waste storage tanks is currently underway at the Savannah river site, prompting the need to characterize the residual contents (heels) of the tanks. Occasionally, results from laboratory analyses indicate alternative sub-sampling strategies are needed, resulting in repetitive efforts to sample and analyze tank bottoms. The development of a system for in situ tank analyses using a radiometric probe, which could be lowered into a waste tank, could aid in identifying waste structures on tank bottoms requiring further sampling and characterization. Ideally, the probe would provide information for determining which structures were higher in concentrations of actinides and fission products characteristic of DOE high level waste (HLW) heels. Although only a limited set of isotopes can be measured directly without extensive radiochemical separations, the low-energy photon spectra of HLW do offer some intriguing possibilities for characterization using a radiometric probe. One possibility for obtaining a low-energy photon spectrum in the presence of high levels of interfering radiation would be to design a probe primarily based upon recently developed technology from Amptek Inc. Such a detector would be relatively insensitive to the high photon background, which would paralyze conventional gamma probes (i.e. sodium iodide) subjected to the same radiological conditions. The prototype detector is capable of successfully obtaining high resolution measurements at very high count rates (in excess of 500,000 counts per second). An overview of measurements obtained from various HLW samples using the prototype Amptek detector, as well as some additional detector technologies, which could enhance this prototype, will be discussed.

The uranium in this series of SRM glasses is a combination of isotopically natural uranium in the materials used to make the glass matrix and isotopically depleted uranium added to increase the uranium elemental concentration across the series. Results for NIST 610 are in excellent agreement with literature values. However, other than atom percent U-235, little information is available for the remaining glasses. We present atom percent and isotope ratios for U-234, U-235, U-236, and U-238 for all four glasses. Our results show deviations from the certificate values for the atom percent U-235, indicating the need for further examination of the uranium isotopes in NIST 610-616.

Electrochemically modulated separations for rapid and sensitive isotopic analysis	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Uranium; Plutonium; Isotope ratio; Multi-collector ICP-MS; Electrochemistry; Pre-concentration; Separations; Matrix elimination; Glassy carbon	MASS-SPECTROMETRY; ELECTRODE	The desire for more rapid and sensitive analytical determinations of actinides in the environment is being addressed in our laboratory through the development of electrochemically modulated separations (EMS) coupled to multiple ion counting inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MIC-ICP-MS). This work is focused on the characterization of EMS separations of U and Pu in swipe materials. EMS provides electrochemically controlled surface complexation of either U(IV) or Pu(IV), depending on the potential applied to an anodized glassy carbon electrode. The accumulation and rinse yields similar to 90 % recovery efficiency, matrix elimination, and analyte concentration of the selected actinide. All this is performed solely under the control of the applied potential. Once isolated, the concentrated actinide is released into a similar to 1 mu L volume of dilute (0.5 M) HNO3, resulting in a volumetrically concentrated transient signal that is ideal for multiple ion counting detection. Coupled with a Thermo Fisher Scientific Neptune Plus MIC-ICP-MS, atom utilization efficiencies are normally 1 %, comparable to the gold standard thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS), but only requiring 20 min for separation and analysis; whereas TIMS requires >50 h for off-line separation, filament preparation, and isotopic analysis. Method and analytical figures of merit will be highlighted.

The isotope provides a unique signature in determining the origin and provenance of uranium-bearing materials and is valuable as a mass spectrometric tracer. Alpha spectrometry was employed in the critical evaluation of a U-233 standard reference material (SRM-995) as a dual tracer system based on the in-growth of Th-229 (t(1/2) similar to 7.34E3 years) for similar to 35 years following radiochemical purification. Preliminary investigations focused on the isotopic analysis of standards and unmodified fractions of SRM-995; all samples were separated and purified using a multi-column anion-exchange scheme. The Th-229/U-233 atom ratio for SRM-995 was found to be 1.598E-4 (+/-4.50 %) using recovery-corrected radiochemical methods. Using the Bateman equations and relevant half-lives, this ratio reflects a material that was purified similar to 36.8 years prior to this analysis. The calculated age is discussed in contrast with both the date of certification and the recorded date of last purification.	[Stanley, F. E.; Glover, S. E.; Stalcup, A. M.; Spitz, H.

Developing and evaluating di(2-ethylhexyl) orthophosphoric acid (HDEHP) based polymer ligand film (PLF) for plutonium extraction	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						HDEHP; PLF; Plutonium; Extraction; Actinide	SEPARATION; COMPLEXATION; MEMBRANE; ELEMENTS; URANIUM; SYSTEM	A method was developed to produce a thin Polymer Ligand Film (PLF) using di(2-ethylhexyl) orthophosphoric acid (HDEHP) ligand for rapid extraction of plutonium. Ligands were incorporated into a polystyrene matrix to generate a smooth and durable surface for analyte extraction. PLFs were prepared with varying amount of ligands to find the optimimum ratio between the ligands and polymer structure to give best plutonium recovery. Also, the plutonium extraction is dependent on the concentration of nitric solution. This dependency was examined in the manuscript. The PLF samples were counted directly using alpha spectroscopy without any further chemical process to test the plutonium recovery. The alpha spectroscopy data shows that HDEHP based PLFs were effective in extracting plutonium from nitric acid solution. The surface characterization was performed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and digital autoradiography for defect examination of the PLF and plutonium distribution study, respectively.

A novel rapid detection approach for the analysis of radionuclides in environmental samples using graphite MALDI mass spectrometry	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						GALDI-ToF-MS; Graphite; Isotopic fingerprinting; Micro-particle; Imaging	LASER-DESORPTION IONIZATION; SMALL MOLECULES; TOF MS; URANIUM; MATRIX; SURFACE	Initial studies into the analysis of Uranium and Lanthanide salts by graphite matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight-mass spectrometry (GALDI-ToF-MS) are presented. It is shown that GALDI-ToF-MS represents a more effective method for ion generation compared to that observed by direct laser irradiation, providing more sensitive analysis and enhanced mass spectral quality. Assessment of sensitivity, detection limits and isotope signature determination is given with absolute detection limits having been found to be in the low ng to pg range and abundance measurements being consistent with expected values to within 2-10 % depending on the relative isotope ion intensities. Using imaging software, GALDI-ToF-MS can be used to identify the presence of low micron-sized uranium oxide particles and establish their distribution across a substrate surface to enable particle location and in so doing identify particles of interest which are of non-natural, enriched content. In this context, GALDI-ToF-MS is proposed as a novel screening method for uranium containing micro-particles which has potential as a rapid and low cost means for particle location to enable effective sampling using micro-manipulation and optical microscopy, for onward isotope ratio mass spectrometry.

New approaches to reprocessing of oxide nuclear fuel	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Spent oxide nuclear fuel; Dissolution; Ferric nitrate solution; Fission products		Dissolution of UO2, U3O8, and solid solutions of actinides in UO2 in subacid aqueous solutions (pH 0.9-1.4) of Fe(III) nitrate was studied. Complete dissolution of the oxides is attained at a molar ratio of ferric nitrate to uranium of 1.6. During this process actinides pass into the solution in the form of U(VI), Np(V), Pu(III), and Am(III). In the solutions obtained U(VI) is stable both at room temperature and at elevated temperatures (60 degrees C), and at high U concentrations (up to 300 mg mL(-1)). Behavior of fission products corresponding to spent nuclear fuel of a WWER-1000 reactor in the process of dissolution the simulated spent nuclear fuel in ferric nitrate solutions was studied. Cs, Sr, Ba, Y, La, and Ce together with U pass quantitatively from the fuel into the solution, whereas Mo, Tc, and Ru remain in the resulting insoluble precipitate of basic Fe salt and do not pass into the solution. Nd, Zr, and Pd pass into the solution by approximately 50 %. The recovery of U or jointly U ? Pu from the dissolution solution of the oxide nuclear fuel is performed by precipitation of their peroxides, which allows efficient separation of actinides from residues of fission products and iron.

Preliminary investigation into suitable techniques to measure the chemical yield of radionuclides in thermal neutron irradiated samples at AWE (Atomic Weapons Establishment)	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Chemical yield; Separation; ICP-AES; XRF; Radionuclide		Radiochemical separation methods are required for the accurate measurement of radionuclides in complex matrices. To be able to quantify the results after the separation of radionuclides, known amounts of either radioactive tracers or inactive carrier solutions are added at the start of the separation. The added isotopes/elements are then measured at the end of the analysis to calculate the chemical yield for the element or isotope. The chemical yield data is applied to the counting data of the analytes of interest to produce quantified results. Recently, changes have been made to the techniques used to measure chemical yields at the Atomic Weapons Establishment for samples containing fission products. Preliminary development work using wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry is discussed, including a comparison of results and evaluation of measurement uncertainty. The use of the techniques to measure fission products in a thermal neutron irradiated uranium sample is described.	[King, A.

Preliminary studies into profiling DNA recovered from a radiation or radioactivity incident	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						DNA; Profiling; Radiation; Radioactivity; AmpFlSTR (R); Quantifiler	DAMAGE	The examination and profiling of human DNA recovered from a scene of crime is an essential aspect of criminal investigations. However, it is currently not known whether DNA recovered from a scene where an ionising radiation source or radioactive contamination is present can be successfully profiled. The direct examination and analysis of radioactively contaminated DNA has not been widely explored using the current procedures employed by forensic service providers. As a result, AWE is putting in place an extensive research and development programme to better understand the effects that radiation has on the ability to profile human DNA, and assess the associated retention of different radioactive contaminants within each step of the profiling procedure. A summary will be provided on the aims of this project and progress that has been made to date; together with a discussion of the lessons that have been learnt during the course of the programme's development.

The ENEA noble gas laboratory: status of implementation	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Noble gases; Radioxenon; Charcoal adsorption; HPGe; Monitoring; Low level counting	XENON	The strategic value of noble gas capability has been recently recognized by ENEA for the acquisition of data about anthropogenic activities. Within the framework of institutional agreements, a laboratory for measurement of radioactive noble gases is under construction for environmental analysis and for monitoring studies in connection with issues related to the nuclear fuel cycle to distinguish the anthropogenic contributions to the environment. This research is intended to contribute also to the international effort to support the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty verification capability. The present work summarizes the status of implementation of the noble gas laboratory at the ENEA Brasimone research centre that is located in the north-centre part of Italy by the Brasimone lake at about 850 m altitude. The radionuclides of interest are the following four xenon radioisotopes: Xe-131m, Xe-133m, Xe-133 and Xe-135. The noble gas system under development at ENEA has three separate components: air collection (sampling and adsorption), processing (gas extraction and purification) and measurement (gamma-ray spectrometry analysis). The separation of the sampling equipment from the analysis is seen as necessary for the effectiveness of extensive sampling campaigns, as required in monitoring programs. Refurbishment is currently under way to accommodate a more sensitive acquisition system.

Analysis of KROTOS Steam Explosion Experiments Using the Improved Fuel-Coolant-Interaction Code TEXAS-VI	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							STRESS INITIATED FRACTURE; SOLIDIFICATION; FRAGMENTATION; MODEL; MECHANISM; TESTS; MELTS; FARO; UO2	In the present study, we propose a new fragmentation criterion for the explosion phase to take account of the effect of partial fuel melt solidification on the rapid fragmentation process. This new criterion judges whether or not the explosive fragmentation can occur by comparing the impact stress induced by vapor film collapse and water jet impingement with the fracture toughness of the corium crust layer. The fragmentation criterion was incorporated into the revised Thermal EXplosion Analysis Simulation (TEXAS) fuel-coolant-interaction (FCI) model TEXAS-VI and combined with the previously proposed fuel particle solidification model and the fragmentation criterion for the mixing phase. TEXAS-VI was compared to KROTOS alumina test K-44 and corium tests K-52 and K-53, and good agreement was obtained. The simulation results indicate that TEXAS-VI has the capability to consider the effect of partial solidification for both the mixing and the explosion phases of the FCI process and can capture the effect of fuel solidification, which reduces corium-water explosion energetics. Experiments K-52 and K-53 also demonstrate the ability of TEXAS-VI to model the effects of ambient pressure on energetics.	[Chen, R. H.; Su, G. H.; Qiu, S.

Sulphur hexafluoride as a stripper gas for tandem accelerators	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Tandem accelerators; Charge state distributions; AMS; Sulphur hexafluoride	MASS-SPECTROMETRY; IONS; AMS; HE	We have investigated sulphur hexafluoride as a stripper gas in tandem accelerators by using the ANTARES accelerator system at ANSTO to measure charge state distributions for this gas. Results are reported at 4 MV terminal voltage for injected negative ions ranging from carbon to uranium oxide. For iodine and thorium the distributions are extended across a range of energies of practical use for accelerator mass spectrometry, ion beam analysis and other accelerator applications. Charge state distributions using sulphur hexafluoride are found to have mean charge states up to I charge unit higher than, and to be broader than, corresponding distributions for argon gas, except in the case of carbon beams. As a result, SF6 is shown to provide significantly higher yields for charge states of heavy ions above the mean charge state. We now perform actinide AMS measurements with 9% yield to the 5+ charge state, compared to 4-5% achieved previously with argon gas. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Hotchkis, M. A.

Refinement of the Compton-Rayleigh scatter ratio method for use on the Mars Science Laboratory alpha particle X-ray spectrometer	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Particle-induced X-ray emission analysis; X-ray fluorescence analysis; Alpha particle X-ray spectrometer; Calibration; Geochemical reference materials	EFFECTIVE ATOMIC-NUMBER; GUPIX-BASED APPROACH; PLUS-XRF SPECTRA; CALIBRATION	Spectra from the Mars rover alpha particle X-ray spectrometers contain the elastic and inelastic scatter peaks of the plutonium L X-rays emitted by the instrument's (CM)-C-244 source. Various spectrum fitting approaches are tested using the terrestrial twin of the APXS instrument on the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover, in order to provide accurate extraction of the L alpha and L beta Compton/Rayleigh intensity ratios, which can provide information about light "invisible" constituents such as water in geological samples. A well-defined dependence of C/R ratios upon mean sample atomic number is established using a large and varied set of geochemical reference materials, and the accuracy of this calibration is examined. Detailed attention is paid to the influence of the rubidium and strontium peaks which overlap the L alpha scatter peaks. Our Monte Carlo simulation code for prediction of C/R ratios from element concentrations is updated. The ratio between measured and simulated C/R ratios provides a second means of calibration.

J	Reinartz, J				Reinartz, Jerome			German nuclear engineering is high tech	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article								Despite the political decision of Germany to opt out of electricity production from nuclear power, know-how in nuclear technology will continue to be needed not only for demolition of nuclear plants and final storage of radioactive waste, but especially in the field of safety technology. "For decades after the last nuclear power plant in Germany has been shut down we will continue to need know-how in nuclear technology, innovative solutions, and well-trained personnel to do the job," said Dr. Ralf Guldner, President of DAtF. "Nuclear technology in this country is more than just electricity generation," Guldner continued. At the "Energy in a Dialog" event organized in Berlin on March 12, 2013, these were topics of debate. Hans-Christoph Pape of the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology and Stefan vom Scheidt, Technical Manager and Spokesman of the Board of Management of Areva GmbH, offered comments and explained the status and perspectives.									0	0	0	2	3	INFORUM VERLAGS-VERWALTUNGSGESELLSCHAFT MBH	BERLIN	ROBERT-KOCH-PLATZ 4, BERLIN, 10115, GERMANY	1431-5254			ATW-INT J NUCL POWER	ATW-Int.

Separation of a Binary Mixture with a Large Mass Difference between the Components in a Gas Centrifuge	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article							FLOW	The separation of a binary gaseous mixture of uranium hexafluoride (UF6)-U-238 with different light components in a high-speed centrifuge, intended for separating heavy isotopes, is examined. The mass of the light impurities is varied in the range M (1) = 0.02-0.349 kg/mole. It is shown that as the impurity mass decreases the structure of the flow fields in the centrifuge rotor changes considerably. If in the case of a mixture of heavy isotopes convective transport has a determining effect on the concentration, for a mixture with a large difference of the mass of the components radial barodiffusion in a centrifugal field becomes primary, which results in the appearance of a maximum of the separation factor at M (1) = 0.127 kg/mole.

Radioecological Assessment of a Uranium Deposit for Validation of the Radiation-Migration Balance of Long-Lived Wastes	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article							RADIONUCLIDES	The irradiation dose to man along different pathways for exposure to radionuclides from deep and surface uranium deposits in the case the radionuclides emerge at the soil surface is determined. It is found that the irradiation dose from radon inhalation is five times higher than the total dose from radionuclides entering with water and food and external irradiation. Radionuclides make the largest contribution (70-93%) to the internal irradiation dose from produce grown on the contaminated territory; polonium is an exception: it enters the body with bread products. The method used to determine the potential radio-ecological hazard posed by a uranium deposit could be helpful for validating the radiation-migration balance of long-lived high-level wastes from nuclear power generation.

In the present study, a coplanar-grid CZT detector was used for gamma-ray measurements of environmental radioactivity on a contaminated saltmarsh sediment core in comparison with results from a coaxial high-purity germanium detector to assess their comparative performance. The findings reveal that the CZT performs well for both Am-241 and Cs-137 measurements over a broad range of activities, despite limited detector efficiency, and can be used to good effect in the study of environmental radioactivity in contaminated estuarine settings.

The activity concentrations of U-238, Th-232 and K-40 in soil samples ranged from 2.6 to 38.1 Bq kg(1) with a mean of 10.40.7 Bq kg(1), 3.740.5 Bq kg(1) with a mean of 12.20.7 Bq kg(1) and 30.0639.7 Bq kg(1) with a mean of 243.412.8 Bq kg(1), respectively. The concentrations of these radionuclides, presented in this article, were compared with those obtained from similar studies related to Turkey reported in the literature as well as earths crust average values. The results of the activity concentrations were used to assess the external absorbed gamma dose rate (GDR) in outdoor air and the annual effective dose (AED).

J	Kim, HG; Kong, TY				Kim, Hee Geun; Kong, Tae Young			A A field test for extremity dose assessment during outages at Korean nuclear power plants	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							MEDICAL APPLICATIONS; EQUIVALENT	During maintenance on the water chamber of a steam generator, the pressuriser heater and the pressure tube feeder in nuclear power plants, workers are likely to receive high radiation doses due to the severe workplace conditions. In particular, it is expected that workers hands would receive the highest radiation doses because of their contact with the radioactive materials. In this study, field tests for extremity dose assessments in radiation workers undertaking contact tasks with high radiation doses were conducted during outages at pressurised water reactors and pressurised heavy water reactors in Korea. In the test, the radiation workers were required to wear additional thermoluminescent dosemeters (TLDs) on their backs and wrists and an extremity dosemeter on the finger, as well as a main TLD on the chest while performing the maintenance tasks.

Recrystallization and fission-gas-bubble swelling of U-Mo fuel	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							IRRADIATION-INDUCED RECRYSTALLIZATION; BURNUP UO2 FUEL; DISPERSION FUEL; NUCLEAR-FUELS; MICROSTRUCTURE; BEHAVIOR; PELLETS; MODEL	At high burnup, U-Mo fuel exhibits some form of recrystallization, by which fuel grains are subdivided. The effect of grain subdivision is to effectively enhance fission gas bubble (FGB) swelling due to increased grain boundaries. Inter-granular FGB swelling, i.e., FGB formation and growth at the grain boundaries, is much larger than the intra-granular FGB swelling. Recrystallized fuel volume fractions of U-Mo fuels irradiated to fission densities reaching 5.7 x 10(21) f/cm(3) were measured. Analytical expressions of recrystallization kinetics of U-Mo fuel during irradiation have been developed through the usage of the Avrami equation, a phenomenological equation which is also used to describe similar typical transformation reactions, such as new phase formation. In this work, we present a novel FGB swelling model of U-Mo fuel that is expressed in terms of Mo content, extent of cold work (fuel powder fabrication method), and fission density.

Impurity characterization of magnesium diuranate using simultaneous TG-DTA-FTIR measurements	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							URANIUM OXIDE; ICP-AES; SPECTROMETRY; SEPARATION; THORIUM; CALIBRATION; EXTRACTION; ELEMENTS	Current studies describe the application of simultaneous thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis - evolved gas analysis techniques for the compositional characterization of magnesium diuranate (MDU) with respect to the impurities present in the matrix. The stoichiometric composition of MDU was identified. as MgU2O7 center dot 3H(2)O. Presence of carbonate and sulphate as impurities in the matrix was confirmed through the evolved gas analysis using Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectrometry detection. Carbon and magnesium hydroxide content present as impurities in magnesium diuranate have been determined quantitatively using TG and FTIR techniques and the results are in good agreement. Powder X-ray diffraction analysis of magnesium diuranate suggests the presence of magnesium hydroxide as impurity in the matrix. Also these studies confirm the formation of magnesium uranate, uranium sesquioxide and uranium dioxide above 1000 degrees C, due to the decomposition of magnesium diuranate. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The ductile-brittle transition behaviors of the specimens were investigated by means of instrumented Charpy impact test at a series of temperature, and SEM was used to observe the morphology of the cross section. Impact tests show that different treatment methods with W films do not have much influence on crack initiation, while EBA treatment with W films can more effectively prevent crack propagation, namely improve the impact toughness of SS than using IBM treatment. The reason that caused this difference was discussed. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
