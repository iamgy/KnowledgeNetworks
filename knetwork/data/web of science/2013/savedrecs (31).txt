Measuring activity of U-235,U- 238, Th-232 and K-40 in geological materials using neutron activation analysis	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Uranium; Thorium; K-40	SOIL SAMPLES; U-238/U-235; SPECTROMETRY; RATIOS; CM-247	The radioactivity of the U-235,U- 238 and Th-232 isotope decay chains for geological samples can usually be assumed to be in equilibrium due to their age. Similarly, one can assume that the isotopic mass proportions are equal to natural isotopic abundance. Current methods used to ascertain activity in these decay chains involve alpha particle spectrometry, ICP-MS or passive gamma-ray spectrometry, all of which can be laborious and time consuming. In this research, we have used thermal and epithermal neutron activation analysis (NAA) of small sample sizes of various geological materials in order to ascertain these activities. By using NAA, we aim to obviate cumbersome sample preparation, the need for large samples and extended counting time. In addition to the decay chains of uranium and thorium, K-40 was also determined using epithermal neutron activation analysis to determine total potassium content and then subtracting out its isotopic contribution.

Nuclear forensics education at the University of Texas at Austin	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Nuclear Forensics; Nuclear Education	RADIOCHEMISTRY	Nuclear forensics continues to be an integral part of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the National Nuclear Security Administration. As with our previous three-year Nuclear Forensics Education Award Program we will continue to offer a comprehensive educational program and closely collaborate with national laboratories to pursue common research. Our research will primarily focus on analysis of radioactive debris following a nuclear or radiological dispersive device event or the investigation of the pedigree of nuclear materials in nonproliferation. This research will include using Compton suppression and gamma coincidence low-level gamma ray counting, investigation of nuclear fuel cycles for nonproliferation, on-site inspection within the context of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and radioxenon detection physics. We also offer a graduate program in nuclear robotics, an interdisciplinary program in the automation of handling special nuclear materials. To better equip our students who are entering the workforce at the national laboratories and government agencies we are also proposing the development of several new laboratory modules for non-destructive identification of fission products in environmental samples and irradiated uranium specimens at various enrichments and characterizing naturally occurring radioactive material. Collaboration with Florida Memorial University a Historically Black Colleges and Universities will continue for training and collaborative research.

Comparison of background gamma-ray spectra between Los Alamos, New Mexico and Austin, Texas	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Gamma-ray spectroscopy; Background; Elevation; Clover; Compton suppression; High-purity germanium detector; HPGe; Nuclear forensics; Naturally occurring radioactive materials; NORM; Inelastic neutron scattering; Cosmic neutrons	SPECTROMETRY	Background counts in gamma-ray spectrometry are caused by a variety of sources. Among these are naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) in the environment, interactions from cosmic radiation, and contamination within the laboratory. High-purity germanium detectors were used to acquire long background spectra in Los Alamos, NM (elevation similar to 7,300 feet) and Austin, TX (elevation similar to 500 feet). This difference in elevation has a sizeable effect on background spectra due to cosmic interactions, such as (n,n') and (n,gamma). Los Alamos also has a fairly high NORM concentration in the soil relative to Austin, and this gives way to various spectral interferences. When analyzing nuclear forensics samples, these background sources can have non-trivial effects on detection limits of low-level fission products. By accurately determining the influence that elevation and environment have on background spectra, interferences within various laboratory environments can be more accurately characterized.

The tritium concentration in Daejeon ranged from 2.27 to 15.71 TU and on Jeju from < 0.5 to 5.4 TU. The maximum value of the tritium content was in March and the minimum in July and August due to the dilution effect of heavy rain. The tritium content in precipitation on Jeju Island was lower than in Daejeon and the results reflected the general tritium content value in the Northern Hemisphere. The stable isotope analysis results showed that the mean value of delta O-18 (aEuro degrees) was -6.28 and ranged from -11.70 to -1.67. Further the mean delta D (aEuro degrees) value was -36.33 and ranged from -85.56 to 4.27. The mean deuterium excess value (d-value) was 13.89 aEuro degrees and ranged from 3.33 to 33.61 aEuro degrees.

RIMS analysis of ion induced fragmentation of molecules sputtered from an enriched U3O8 matrix	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Resonance ionization; Mass spectrometry; Uranium; Cluster ions; Useful yield	IONIZATION MASS-SPECTROMETRY; KINETIC-ENERGY DISTRIBUTIONS; CLUSTER BOMBARDMENT; URANIUM PARTICLES; ISOTOPE RATIOS; CROSS-SECTIONS; PLUTONIUM; DESORPTION; RESOLUTION; EMISSION	Resonance ionization mass spectrometry was used to measure the composition of the sputtered flux from 15 keV Ga+, Au+, Au-2 (+) and Au-3 (+) primary ions impacting a U-235 enriched U3O8 standard. We demonstrate that molecular fragmentation decreases as the primary ion mass and nuclearity increases. Stopping and range of ions in matter calculations show that cluster ions (Au-2 (+) and Au-3 (+)) deposit more of their energy via direct knock-ons with near-surface target atoms, whereas monatomic ions (Ga+ and Au+) penetrate much deeper into the target sub-surface region. We correlate these results to the experimental observations by showing that increased cluster ion sputter yields partition the projectile energy over a larger number of sputtered molecules. Therefore, while cluster ions deposit more total energy into the near surface region of the target compared to monatomic ions, the energy per molecule decreases with projectile mass and nuclearity. Less energy per molecule decreases the number of U-O bond breaks and, consequently, leads to a decrease in molecular fragmentation. Additionally, the extent of molecular fragmentation as a function of ion dose was evaluated. We show that molecular fragmentation increases with increased ion dose; primarily as a result of sub-surface chemical damage accumulation. The relative intensity of this effect appears to be projectile independent.

Carbon-14 labelled sucrose transportation in an Arabidopsis thaliana using an imaging plate and real time imaging system	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Carbon-14; Arabidopsis thaliana; Imaging plate; Real time RI imaging system; Foliar absorption	LIVING PLANT	As an approach to increased production of rape seed oil from Brassica napus L., Arabidopsis thaliana, a species from the same Brassicaceae family, was used to investigate transport behavior and distribution of matter in the plant body. In this study, sucrose, an initial metabolic product of photosynthesis, labeled with carbon-14 was used. The sucrose was applied to A. thaliana via the surface of a rosette leaf. Using the real time radioisotope imaging system we developed and an imaging plate (IP), images of whole or part of the sample were obtained. The sucrose assimilation products were accumulated in maturing tissue such as flowers and fruits, and in a joint part. From the comparison among branches and stems, it was indicated that there were different patterns of demand and distribution of sucrose assimilation products depending on the tissue and its growing stage. This might be caused by either morphological reason such as diameter and location of the sieve tube, or genetic factors such as an activity of a membrane transport protein. Because of self-absorption of carpels, it was difficult to observe the accumulation of carbon-14 in the seeds inside the fruits; however, an IP image of a frozen section of a fruit revealed that carbon-14 transport to seeds was higher than that of carpels. These methods will help us gain insight into matter transport and strategies to improve the production of rape seed oil.

Development of a C-14 detectable real-time radioisotope imaging system for plants under intermittent light environment	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Autoradiography; Photosynthetic products; Plant biology; Carbon-14; Sulfur-35; Noninvasive measurement		A new real-time radioisotope imaging system (RRIS) to study the kinetics of nutrient uptake and transfer of photosynthetic products in a living plant was developed and evaluated through a test run. C-14 is a common radioisotope of carbon and useful to trace the photosynthetic products as well as a low energy beta emitter. The rationale of this study was to develop a RRIS that has the ability to detect low energy beta emitters, such as C-14, S-35, and Ca-45. To achieve compatibility between the detection of low energy beta emitters and irradiation of the test plant, an intermittent lighting system was added to the RRIS. Furthermore, a commercially available digital camera was added to the RRIS for acquisition of photographic images of the test plants. The capabilities of the new RRIS were evaluated through a test run by using seedlings of rice plants and S-35-labeled sulfate. It was shown that the new RRIS was able to detect S-35 absorbed by rice plant seedlings, and it was able to acquire photon-counting images and photographic images of the test plants simultaneously. Despite some limitations, the new RRIS provides a means to study the kinetics of elements in plants by utilizing low energy beta emitters.

Gamma spectrometer measurements of microgram quantities of plutonium using uranium L X-rays in the 13-21 keV region	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Marple cascade impactor; Plutonium; Americium-241; X-ray fluorescence; Gamma ray spectrometry; Thermal ionization mass spectrometry	EMISSION	Nineteen groups of Marple series cascade impact filters were used to collect aerosol particles associated with various operations in plutonium glove boxes. The cascade impactor separated particles based upon size, while the total mass of plutonium deposited on the filters ranged from 10(-4) to 10(-8) g. Gamma spectrometer measurements with an n-type high-purity germanium detector (HPGe) were performed with the goal of accurately quantifying the Pu-239 mass on each filter using counts from the uranium L X-rays in the 13-21 keV region. However, the mass was great enough in some of the measurements to also quantify using the Pu-239 gamma ray at 129.29 keV. One-half portions of each filter were also analyzed using thermal ionization mass spectroscopy (TIMS) and comparisons between the two methods were performed. A significant challenge was to find a calibration source with very low self-absorption characteristics so that the detector response to the low-energy X-rays could be properly characterized. This was accomplished by doping an actual Marple filter with a small NIST traceable quantity of Pu-239 (7.3 mu g). The comparison of gamma spectrometry to TIMS results yielded largely favorable results. Some notable sources of measurement bias beyond counting statistics were uncovered in the process. The particle distributions on the filters were not perfectly symmetrical, and since the TIMS analyses were performed on just one-half of a filter, a significant difference could result. Replicate filter gamma measurements revealed potential biases in the reproducibility of sample geometry, and high concentrations of Am-241 appeared to cause L-shell X-ray fluorescence effects in two of the filter sets.

Characterization of uranium isotopic abundances in depleted uranium metal assay standard 115	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Depleted uranium; Certified reference materials; Thermal ionization mass spectrometry; Isotope-amount ratios		Certified reference material (CRM) 115, Uranium (Depleted) Metal (Uranium Assay Standard), was analyzed using a TRITON Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometer to characterize the uranium isotope-amount ratios. The certified U-235/U-238 "major" isotope-amount ratio of 0.0020337 (12) in CRM 115 was determined using the total evaporation (TE) and the modified total evaporation (MTE) analytical techniques. In the MTE method, the total evaporation process is interrupted on a regular basis to allow correction of background from peak tailing, internal calibration of the secondary electron multiplier detector versus the Faraday cups, peak-centering, and ion source re-focusing. For the "minor" U-234/U-238 and U-236/U-238 isotope-amount ratio measurements using MTE, precision and accuracy comparable to conventional analyses are achieved, without compromising the quality of the U-235/U-238 isotope-amount ratios. Characterized values of the U-234/U-238 and U-236/U-238 isotope-amount ratios in CRM 115 are 0.000007545 (10) and 0.000032213 (84), respectively. The U-233/U-238 isotope-amount ratio in CRM 115 is estimated to be < 5 x 10(-9). The homogeneity of the CRM 115 materials is established through the absence of any statistically significant unit-to-unit variation in the uranium isotope-amount ratios. The measurements leading to the certification of uranium isotope-amount ratios are discussed.	[Mathew, K. J.; Singleton, G. L.; Essex, R.

J	Wegener, MR; Mathew, KJ; Hasozbek, A				Wegener, Michael R.; Mathew, Kattathu J.; Hasozbek, Altug			The direct total evaporation (DTE) method for TIMS analysis	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Total evaporation; Thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS); Isotope-amount ratios; MAT 261/MAT 262	URANIUM	The total evaporation (TE) method is an established analytical method for safeguards measurements of uranium and plutonium isotope-amount ratios using thermal ionization mass spectrometry. As fractionation effects are minimized in this analytical method, it is a method of choice in many practical applications that require high accuracy and precision isotope abundance ratio measurements. The speed of signal regulation is a critical parameter for a steady sample evaporation process. Standard TE methods use the data system to read the ion signal and its difference from the target intensity is used to determine the increment in which the filament is heated. The new, hardware-driven proprietary direct total evaporation method uses an analog regulator in the filament power supply with direct feedback of the detector intensity. Only target values are set by the data system initially. The filament heating and sample evaporation process is then carried out by the hardware. The data system just monitors, collects, and calculates the data. Due to the nature of electronic regulation the ion signal is kept stable for the duration of the run until the whole sample is consumed. For routine uranium isotopic analyses of the major isotope-amount ratio n(U-235)/n(U-238) using a modified MAT261 instrument with SPECTROMAT (TM) hardware and software upgrades, precision (relative standard deviation, expressed as a percent) and accuracy (relative difference, expressed as a percent) of 0.05 % are obtained for low enriched and high enriched uranium certified reference materials.

Uranium isotope dilution mass spectrometry using NBL certified reference materials as spikes	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Isotope dilution mass spectrometry; Spike; Uranium concentration; Certified reference material; CRM 112-A; CRM 115		The isotope dilution mass spectrometry method of analysis is used to determine the elemental uranium contents in a wide variety of uranium bearing materials. The method is based on the mass spectrometric analysis of a mixture prepared by diluting the sample to be analyzed with a spike of distinctly different isotopic composition to that of the sample. In this work, a beginning is made to identify suitable candidates among the multitude of certified reference materials (CRMs) available at the New Brunswick Laboratory to supplant the use of U-233 which remains now as the preferred spike nuclide. The results of the study presented here identify CRM 112-A (of normal isotopic composition) and CRM 115 (depleted uranium composition) as suitable candidates to replace U-233 as spike material for determining uranium in high enriched uranium materials, and CRM 116 (U-235 mass fraction of > 90 %) for determining uranium in materials of low enrichment.

Actinide cyanometallates	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Actinide; Thorium; Tetracyanoplatinate; Hexacyanoferrate; Coordination complex; XRD structure		Simple salts of the tetracyanoplatinate (TCP) anions with the general formula M[Pt(CN)(4)] (x) center dot H2O have been described for over 200 years. A major structural feature of these compounds are pseudo one dimensional Pt center dot center dot center dot Pt interactions between the square planar tetracyanoplatinate anions. These interactions form quasi one-dimensional chains in the solid state and are believed to be the source of their unique spectroscopic and emission properties. The lanthanides offer the ability to tune the Pt center dot center dot center dot Pt spacing of these pseudo one dimensional chains, predictably by taking advantage of the lanthanide contraction. Here, we describe the emission and structural characteristics of new actinide tetracyanometallates.	[Maynard, Branson A.; Lynn, Kelly S.; Gorden, Anne E.

Tracers for radiopharmaceutical production facilities	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Xenon; Radiopharmaceutical; Tracer Xe-133; Xe-131m; Xe-135; Xe-133m		When radiopharmaceutical production facilities irradiate uranium targets for the production of radionuclides such as Mo-99, the emissions interfere with the global monitoring efforts conducted by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization. While suppressing emissions from such facilities would be ideal, it is understood that radioxenon emissions may not be reduced to levels below detectable quantities. As a result, a study was conducted to investigate tracers that may be utilized for source identification upon measurement. Both radioactive and stable tracers were evaluated.	[Biegalski, S. R.

The isotope is formed in uranium materials through several pathways and is typically found at ultra-trace levels (usually ng/g or smaller) in typical uranium materials. The low abundance of this isotope in irradiated materials makes it very difficult to measure accurately and precisely. Many different methods have been proposed for the analysis of U-232 using radiochemical methods including alpha and gamma spectrometry. In this paper, literature methods will be discussed and an improved method using alpha spectrometry will be presented. Alpha spectrometry offers a direct analysis technique for measuring U-232, with few interferences that can be removed via separations. Results from our improved method will be presented and compared to results obtained from a non-destructive gamma spectrometry method that utilizes an indirect measurement. LA-UR-12-20186.

Determination of uranium, thorium and plutonium isotopes by ICP-MS	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Actinides; Isotopes; ICP-MS; Bioassay; Internal committed dose; Radioactive waste; Nuclear fuel	PLASMA-MASS SPECTROMETRY; INTRODUCTION SYSTEM; RAPID-DETERMINATION; NUCLEAR-FUEL; URINE; SAMPLES; PU-239; CHEMISTRY; BURNUP; RATIO	Quantitative and isotopic measurement of actinide elements is required in many circumstances in the nuclear industry. For example, determination of very low levels of these alpha emitters in human urine samples is used to assess the internal committed dose for nuclear workers. Quantifying actinide isotopes in radioactive waste from nuclear processing and nuclear facility decommissioning provides important information for waste management. Accurate determination of the uranium isotopic ratios in reactor fuels provides fuel burnup information. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) has been used for the determination of Th, U, and Pu in various samples including urine, nuclear waste, and nuclear fuel in our laboratory. In order to maximize the capability of the technique and ensure quality analyses, ICP-MS was used to analyze samples directly, or after pre-treatment to separate complicated matrices or to concentrate the analyte(s). High-efficiency sample introduction techniques were investigated. Spectral interferences to minor isotopes caused by peak tails and hydride ions of major actinide isotopes were studied in detail using solutions prepared with light and heavy waters. The quality of the isotopic ratio measurement was monitored using standard reference materials.

In this report, the reanalysis of DSS-2, which was carried out immediately, but previously unpublished, using an analysis scheme specifically adapted to the waste's physicochemical properties, is described. The TOC accounting climbed to 72.3 %, unmasking a complex mixture of semivolatile and hydrophilic organics, including numerous oxidation and/or degradation products. Reevaluation of the DSS-2 data now reveals the presence of several chelator fragments, including nitrosated species.	[Toste, A.

All three employ the principle of beta-gamma coincidence detection to reduce background counting rates, using a BC-404 plastic scintillator to detect the betas and a CsI or NaI scintillator to detect the gamma-rays. As a consequence of this commonality of design, all three also display a "memory effect" arising from the diffusion of Xe into BC-404. Thus, when one sample is pumped out of the detector, a fraction remains behind, embedded in the BC-404, where it artificially raises the signal counting rate for the next sample. While this is not a fatal flaw in scintillator detectors, developing a method to eliminate the memory effect would significantly enhance their utility. This paper reports efforts to develop thin, amorphous Al2O3 films, deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) to act as diffusion barriers on the BC-404 surfaces exposed to radioxenon. Using radon as a convenient substitute for Xe, film thicknesses between 2 and 10 nm were originally investigated and found to show a memory effect to varying degrees. A second set of 20 and 30 nm films was then produced, which appeared to completely eliminate the radon memory effect, but, when consequentially tested with radioxenon, were found to exhibit xenon memory effects that were approximately half of the effect found on uncoated BC-404. We draw two conclusions from this result. The first is that it will be necessary to develop an improved method for depositing thicker ALD Al2O3 films at lower temperatures while still retaining high film quality. The second is that, since xenon is required to test for the xenon memory effect, we need a test method that does not require xenon radio-isotopes in order to facilitate screening large numbers of samples.

Near infrared reflectance spectroscopy as a process signature in uranium oxides	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Nuclear forensics; Uranium oxide; Uranium ore concentrate; Yellowcake; Near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy; NIR		Near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectroscopy was examined as a potential tool for the determination of forensic signatures indicative of the chemical process history of uranium oxides. The ability to determine the process history of nuclear materials is a desired, but underdeveloped, area of technical nuclear forensics. Application of the NIR technique potentially offers a quick and non-destructive tool to serve this need; however, few data have been published on the compounds of interest. The viability of NIR was investigated through the analysis of a combination of laboratory-derived and real-world uranium precipitates and oxides. A set of reference uranium materials was synthesized in the laboratory using the commonly encountered aqueous precipitation reactions for uranium ore concentration and chemical separation processes (ammonia, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hydroxide, ammonium carbonate, and magnesia). NIR spectra were taken on a range of samples heat treated in air between 85 and 750 A degrees C. X-ray diffraction patterns were also obtained to complement the NIR analysis with crystal phase information. Similar analyses were performed using a set of real-world samples, with process information obtained from the literature, to provide a comparison between materials synthesized in the laboratory and samples representative of industrial processes.

The subject of investigation is the selective separation of fission products (FPs) from spent nuclear fuel as a head-end step to either classical hydro based or pyro processes which are not yet applied on a large scale. The selective removal of FPs that are major contributors to the overall radiation dose or bear great potentials in terms of radiotoxicity (i.e. cesium or iodine), is advantageous for further processes. At PSI a device was developed to release volatile FPs by means of inductive heating. The heating up to 2,300 A degrees C promotes the release of material that is further transported by a carrier gas stream into an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer for online detection. The carrier gas can be either inert (Ar) or can contain reducing or oxidizing components like hydrogen or oxygen, respectively. The development of the device by computer aided engineering approaches, the commissioning and evaluation of the device and data from first release experiments on a simulated fuel matrix are discussed.

For this purpose, ground gamma-ray spectrometric surveys were conducted using a portable GS-512 spectrometer, with an NaI (Tl) detector, on an area 77.5 km(2) in surface area located between the cities of Rafah and Elareish on the Mediterranean Sea coast. The results revealed that the black-sand beach deposits could be differentiated according to their total-count (TC) radioactivity into five normally distributed interpreted radiometric lithologic (IRL) units denoted by U1, U2, U3, U4 and U5. The computed characteristic TC radiometric statistics of these five IRL units range from 4.67 to 9.96 Ur for their individual arithmetic means. The computed arithmetic means for the three radioelements K, eU and eTh reach 0.46 , 2.25 and 6.17 ppm, respectively for the whole study area. Monitoring the environmental effects of radioelement concentrations on the study area showed that the mean natural equivalent radiation dose rate from the terrestrial gamma-radiation of the whole area attains 0.33 mSv y(1). This average value remains on the safe side and within the maximum permissible safe radiation dose (1.0 mSv y(1)) without harm to the individual, except at three scattered points reaching more than these values. Some of the local inhabitants in the region sometimes use black sands as a building material. Consequently, they are not recommended for use as building materials, because the inhabitants will, then, receive a relatively high radioactive dose generated mainly by monazite and zircon minerals, two of the main constituents of black sands.

This paper presents Rn-222 radioactivity concentration levels in well waters located in and around the city of Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. Water samples were collected from 171 wells in six different locations. Most of these deep wells have an approximate depth of 1000 m, while shallow wells have a depth of 300 m. The analyses were performed by an ultra-low level liquid scintillation spectrometer equipped with an alphabeta discrimination device. Efficiency and background calibrations were performed with a Ra-226 aqueous standard homogeneously mixed with a cocktail (high efficiency mineral oil scintillator) which was used after a certain period of time to assure radon equilibrium. The measured Rn-222 activities of deep wells ranged from 0.340.05 to 3.520.30 Bq l(1) (average: 1.010.10 Bq l(1)), whereas those of shallow wells ranged from 0.720.08 to 7.210.58 Bq l(1) (average: 2.740.24 Bq l(1)). The Rn-222 concentrations levels were found to be in compliance with the proposed national limits of 11.1 Bql(1) and depend on the water source.

SALT-COOLED MODULAR INNOVATIVE THORIUM HEAVY WATER-MODERATED REACTOR SYSTEM	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Monteburns; heavy water-moderated; burnup	OXIDE FUEL	This paper describes a new reactor concept: the Salt-cooled Modular Innovative THorium HEavy water-moderated Reactor System (SMITHERS), which addresses the goals of (a) evolving deployment needs, (b) increasing overall fuel burnup, (c) reducing proliferation risk, and (d) providing high-efficiency power generation. The reactor is modular and thus scalable from a few to hundreds of megawatts (thermal). The concept further burns used fuel from light water reactors (LWRs) without aqueous separations, reducing costs and proliferation pathways relative to current reprocessing plants. The additional burning of LWR fuel reduces proliferation risk by reducing global inventories of plutonium from used fuel in a way that does not isolate weapons-useable material and that increases the amount of power produced per ton of mined uranium. Improved fuel utilization through the potential use of thorium provides cost benefits by increasing neutron economy and enabling operation at higher efficiencies. Neutron economy is increased by using the lower neutron energies associated with large quantities of heavy water moderation and/or thorium for innovative reactor control and constant long-term power generation (i.e., sustainability). Finally, the proposed reactor also generates high-temperature coolant discharge in the form of liquid salt without coolant pressurization for external process heat applications such as oil extraction. Salt offers significant improvement over existing coolants such as light water and heavy water, which require pressurization to operate at high temperatures, adding to the cost and complexity of reactor operation. SMITHERS designs discussed in this paper either burned a full core of used fuel, ThO2 with 1.2 wt% PuO2 or other fissile material, or a combination of the two.

VIABILITY ASSESSMENT OF NOBLE GAS BUNDLE TAGGING FOR FAILED-FUEL IDENTIFICATION IN CANDU REACTORS	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						bundle tagging; noble gases; CANDU fuel failures	FAILURE MONITORING ANALYSIS; COOLANT ACTIVITY BEHAVIOR; FISSION-PRODUCT RELEASE; TAG IDENTIFICATION; DEFECTIVE FUEL; ELEMENTS; MODEL; ASSEMBLIES; RODS; OXIDATION	Current limitations of Canadian Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) reactors to reliably locate defective fuel bundles have created interest in new identification techniques. Noble gas tagging, which would involve the addition of specific combinations of Kr and Xe isotopes to the fuel-to-sheath gap during manufacturing, has the potential to offer a means of locating failed-fuel bundles on power, where the released tag could be measured in the primary heat transport system by mass spectrometry. Moreover, the technique could be of particular interest for demonstration irradiations with new fuel bundle designs. This work outlines preliminary considerations on the applicability of noble gas tagging for CANDU reactors. This assessment involved the determination of suitable tag isotopes, the simulation of the impact of the tag on the thermal performance of a fuel element, and the determination of the detection limit of a quadrupole inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer instrument for krypton samples with typical aqueous concentrations in the range of 10(-12) to 10(-9) (mol(Kr)/mol(H2O)).

THE EFFECT OF COATING PARAMETERS AND ANNEALING ON THE CRUSHING STRENGTH OF TRISO COATED PARTICLES	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						coating parameters; TRISO particles; crushing strength	GAS-COOLED REACTOR; FUEL-PARTICLES; SIC PROPERTIES; TEMPERATURE	The crushing strength (load at fracture) of coated particles was measured by compression between soft metal anvils. The method requires no sample preparation and can be used as a quality control method as well as a valuable tool for comparing different coating conditions during the manufacture of TRISO particles. Batches of coated particles manufactured with different coating parameters were prepared and tested. Batches prepared under different conditions exhibited significant differences in crushing strength. Higher argon concentrations in the coater gas mixture resulted in higher crushing strength. Anomalies in the crushing strength of particles are related to defects and possibly residual stresses produced during coating. The influence of annealing at 1950 degrees C on crushing strength was also investigated. The average crushing strength of batches of particles decreased with annealing. Different preparation methods showed a marked difference in the level of deterioration of the particles with annealing. Batches produced with 80% argon gas mixture at 1300 degrees C showed the greatest reduction in crushing strength. An inverse correlation was found between the crushing strength and the uranium that is leached from batches. The particles with the lowest crushing strength would also be more susceptible to mechanical damage during handling and consequently also to leaching of the uranium during leach tests.	[Hancke, J.

UO2-Gd2O3 mixed fuel shows bad sintering behavior, which is hindered at temperatures of 1200 degrees C. The mechanism that explains this unusual sintering behavior is not yet fully understood. The formation of Gd-rich phases with low diffusivity or pore formation during sintering have both been suggested as possible causes. Experimental data published in the literature appear not to support phase formation; however, the formation of large closed pores in Gd2O3-rich regions of the fuel has been reported. Pore formation could be developed during the Gd2O3 C -> B phase transition, which is followed by volume reduction. Our study investigated this hypothesis. The results showed that the mechanism proposed does not explain the UO2-Gd2O3 sintering behavior.

A 5-cm-length reversed-phase column coated with tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOP 0) was connected in series to a 10-cm-length reversed-phase monolithic column (dynamically modified into a cation exchange column) to accomplish individual isolation of lanthanides from the uranium matrix. The proposed technique eliminates the step of uranium matrix removal for the determination of lanthanides. Samples with a lanthanide-to-uraniuni ratio (1 part lanthanide to 10(5) parts uranium) were directly injected into the dual column for the quantitative determination of lanthanides without uranium matrix removal. In some studies, samples of lanthanides in the uranium matrix could be injected as much as 45 times consecutively into a high-performance liquid chromatography system for determination of lanthanides without any uranium elution. The retention behavior of Pu(IV), Pu(III), Am(III), and fission products was also investigated on the TOPO-coated support. The single-stage dual-column chromatographic technique was demonstrated for the determination of fission products such as La and Nd in the dissolver solution of pressurized heavy water reactor spent fuel for the measurement of atom percent fission burnup. The technique can also be employed to estimate lanthanide impurities in samples of UO2 (I part lanthanide to 10(6) parts uranium) without removal of the uranium matrix.

Criticality experiments for validation of cross sections: The neptunium case	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Fission; Cross section; Neptunium; Criticality	NUCLEAR-DATA; TECHNOLOGY; SCIENCE; U-235	The Np-237 neutron-induced fission cross section has been measured recently in a large energy range (from eV to GeV) at the n_TOF facility at CERN. When compared to previous measurement the n_TOF fission cross section appears to be higher by 5-7% beyond the fission threshold. To check the relevance of n_TOF data, we simulate a criticality experiment performed at Los Alamos with a 6 kg sphere of Np-237. This sphere was surrounded by enriched uranium U-235 so as to approach criticality with fast neutrons. The simulation predicts a multiplication factor k(eff) in better agreement with the experiment (the deviation of 750 pcm is reduced to 250 pcm) when we replace the ENDF/B-VII.0 evaluation of the Np-237 fission cross section by the n_TOF data. We also explore the hypothesis of deficiencies of the inelastic cross section in U-235 which has been invoked by some authors to explain the deviation of 750 pcm. The large distortion that should be applied to the inelastic cross sections in order to reconcile the critical experiment with its simulation is incompatible with existing measurements. Also we show that the (nu) over bar of Np-237 can hardly be incriminated because of the high accuracy of the existing data. Fission rate ratios or averaged fission cross sections measured in several fast neutron fields seem to give contradictory results on the validation of the Np-237 cross section but at least one of the benchmark experiments, where the active deposits have been well calibrated for the number of atoms, favors the n_TOF data set. These outcomes support the hypothesis of a higher fission cross section of Np-237. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Leong, L. S.; Tassan-Got, L.; Audouin, L.; Wilson, J.

The prospect of gas cooled fast reactors for long life reactors with natural uranium as fuel cycle input	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Gas cooled fast reactors; Modified CANDLE; Long life fast reactors; Natural uranium; Fuel cycle input	NUCLEAR-POWER REACTORS; CANDLE BURNUP; NITRIDE; DESIGN; LEAD; PERFORMANCE; CORE; MOX	Gas cooled fast reactors are among the Generation 4 nuclear power plants (NPPs) with hard neutron spectrum characteristics which can be utilized to create power reactors with high breeding/conversion ratio capability. In this study the gas cooled reactor system is combined with modified CANDLE burn-up scheme to create long life fast reactors with natural uranium as fuel cycle input. Such a system can utilize natural uranium resources efficiently without the necessity of enrichment plant or reprocessing plant. Therefore, by using this type of nuclear power plants optimum nuclear energy utilization, including in developing countries, can be easily obtained without the problem of nuclear proliferation. In this paper, a design study of 800 MWt long-life gas cooled fast reactors with natural uranium as fuel cycle input has been performed. Due to the thermal hydraulic constraints, the average power density of the proposed design is limited to 70 W/cc. The system has excellent performance and is at least comparable to that of Pb-Bi cooled system. The average discharge burn-up is about 258 GWd/ton HM. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

As a preliminary analysis of the RMWR, a simplified fuel pin configuration was analyzed. In case of 60% doping of Np-237 and Am-241 in the inner blanket, the maximum available effective full power days (EFPDs) were much longer and were about 15,100 and 14,200 EFPDs, respectively. For the proliferation resistance of Pu produced in the blanket, the total Pu in the inner and lower/upper blanket was below the practically unusable criterion for an explosive device proposed by Pellaud, and was technically unfeasible for high-technology hypothetical nuclear explosive devices (HNEDs) proposed by Kessler and Kimura. The protected Pu breeding performance was analyzed and in case of 60% doping of Np-237 and Am-241, CSDT was short by approximately 40 and 50 years. Therefore, the feasibility of RMWR was shown which could simultaneously achieve the extension of core life-time and have highly protected Pu breeding performance with short CSDT by doping the inner blanket with minor actinides (MM). The objective of this study was thus to evaluate the performance of the concept with respect to the core life-time, proliferation resistance of Pu and CSDT. The technological feasibility of such core concept will have to be evaluated by further dedicated analyses. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Effects of operating parameters such as flow rate and bed height were studied. The breakthrough capacity decreases with increasing flow rate, but this dependence was not significant with a long column. The maximum breakthrough capacity of uranium ions were achieved by CG-400 resin at a flow rate of 0.2 mL min(-1) and bed height 9.1 cm (4 g resin). The elution behavior of uranium from CG-400 resin by various eluents have been investigated and the results show that 0.5 mol L-1 HNO3 is a good eluent for uranium recovery. The Adams-Bohart, Thomas, Yoon-Nelson and Dose-Response models were applied to the experimental data to determine the characteristic parameters of the column for process design using linear regression. The breakthrough curve calculated from the Dose-Response model was in best agreement with the experimental data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Calibration method of liquid zone controller using the ex-core detector signal of CANDU 6 reactor	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						CANDU 6; Phase-B; Liquid zone control system; Reactivity calculator		The Phase-B test (low-power reactor physics test) is one of the commissioning tests for Canada Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) reactors that ensures the safe and reliable operation of the core during the design lifetime. The Phase-B test, which includes the approach to the first criticality at low reactor powers, is performed to verify the feasibility of the reactor's physics design and to ensure the integrity of the control and protection facilities. The commissioning testing of pressurized heavy water moderated reactors (PHWRs) is usually performed only once (at the initial commissioning after construction). The large-scale facilities of the Wolsong nuclear power plant (NPP) Unit 1 have been gradually improved since May 2009 to extend its lifetime. The refurbishment was completed in April 2011 - then this NPP has been in operation again. We discusses the new methodology and measurement system that uses an ex-core detector signal for liquid zone controller (LZC) calibration of the Phase-B test instead of conventional methods. The inverse kinetic equation in the reactivity calculator is modified to treat the 17 delayed neutron groups including 11 photo-neutron fractions. The signal acquisition resolution of the reactivity calculator was enhanced and installed reactivity calculating module by each channel. The ex-core detector was confirmed to be applicable to a large reactor core, such as the CANDU 6 by comparison with the in-core flux detector signal. A preliminary test was performed in Wolsong NPP Unit 2 to verify the robustness of the reactivity calculator. This test convincingly demonstrated that the reactivity calculator works well. Commissioning testing of Wolsong NPP Unit 1 was performed after successful refurbishment in June 2011. The LZC calibration test was completed successfully, and the requirement of the test was satisfied. The test difference was biased by approximately -6% between 20% and 70% of the liquid zone level. Moreover, the test was completed within 4 h compared with about 48 h required for Wolsong NPP Units 2, 3, and 4. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Park, D.

Bioleaching of uranium in batch stirred tank reactor: Process optimization using Box-Behnken design	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Optimization; Box-Behnken design; Uranium bioleaching; Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans; Stirred tank reactor	RESPONSE-SURFACE METHODOLOGY; FERROUS IRON; FERROOXIDANS; CHALCOPYRITE; REMOVAL; IONS	To design industrial reactors, it is important to identify and optimize the effective parameters of the process. Therefore, in this study, a three-level Box-Behnken factorial design was employed combining with a response surface methodology to optimize pulp density, agitation speed and aeration rate in uranium bioleaching in a stirred tank reactor using a pure native culture of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. A mathematical model was then developed by applying the least squares method using the software Minitab Version 16.1.0. The second order model represents the uranium recovery as a function of pulp density, agitation speed and aeration rate. An analysis of variance was carried out to investigate the effects of individual variables and their combined interactive effects on uranium recovery. The results showed that the linear and quadratic terms of variables were statistically significant whilst the interaction terms were statistically insignificant. The model estimated that a maximum uranium extraction (99.99%) could be obtained when the pulp density, agitation speed and aeration rate were set at optimized values of 5.8% w/v, 510 rpm and 250 I/h, respectively. A confirmatory test at the optimum conditions resulted in a uranium recovery of 95%, indicating a marginal error of 4.99%. Furthermore, control tests were performed to demonstrate the effect of A. ferrooxidans in uranium bioleaching process and showed that the addition of this microorganism greatly increases the uranium recovery.

Determination of dependence of fissile fraction in MOX fuels on spent fuel storage period for different burnup values	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						MOX; Storage period; Plutonium; Burnup; Monteburns		The purpose of this technical note is to remove one of the limitations of a derived expression in a previously published article (Ozdemir et al., 2011). The original article focused on deriving (computationally) an expression for calculating total fissile fraction of mixed oxid (MOX) fuels depending on discharge burnup of spent fuel and desired burnup of MOX fuel; consequently, such an expression was obtained and put forward, together with its limitations. One of the limitations has been that all the computations and therefore the resulting expression are based on the assumption of a spent fuel storage period of 5 years. This follow-up study simply aims to obtain a correction factor for spent fuel storage periods other than 5 years; thus to remove one major restriction on use of the expression derived in the original article.

Two-step iterative static model for boron isotope separation	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Boron isotope separation by laser assisted; retarded condensation; Enrichment factor; Product cut; Slit nozzle; Global optimization; Multipass cavity	LASER; CONDENSATION; MOLECULES; GASES	A new static model for boron isotope separation by the laser assisted retardation of condensation method (SILARC) on the basis of model developed by Jeff Eerkens is proposed. This model was developed for so called two step iterative scheme for isotopes enrichment. From this model optimal conditions, that include carrier gas choice, rarefication degree in carrier gas, laser pulse intensity, gas pulse duration, gas pressure and temperature in reservoir and irradiation cells, optimal irradiation cell and skimmer chamber volumes, optimal nozzle throughput can be found by finding global minimum of specific objective function related to the minimum of total energy expenses. The relationships between nozzle throat area, irradiation cell (IC) volume, laser intensity, carrier gas choice, number of nozzles, number of vacuum pumps, and required isotope production rate were derived. Solution of optimal gas flow irradiation scheme problem is illustrated on example of two types of irradiation cells suitable for industrial application. The first one has only a large throughput slit nozzle, while the second one has a large number of nozzles with modest throughput. It was shown that the last one has much better performance than the former one. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Lyakhov, K. A.; Lee, H.

THE GULF WAR DEPLETED URANIUM COHORT AT 20 YEARS: BIOASSAY RESULTS AND NOVEL APPROACHES TO FRAGMENT SURVEILLANCE	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						diagnostic imaging; excretion; urinary; exposure; radiation; uranium; depleted	ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY; DRINKING-WATER; RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS; HEALTH SURVEILLANCE; EMBEDDED FRAGMENTS; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; FOREIGN-BODY; FOLLOW-UP; VETERANS; URINE	During the 1991 GulfWar, U.S. service members were exposed to depleted uranium (DU) through friendly-fire incidents involving DU munitions and vehicles protected by DU armor. Routes of exposure to DU involved inhalation of soluble and insoluble DU oxide particles, wound contamination, and retained embedded DU metal fragments that continue to oxidize in situ and release DU to the systemic circulation. A biennial health surveillance program established for this group of Veterans by the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs has shown continuously elevated urine DU concentrations in the subset of veterans with embedded fragments for over 20 years. While the 2011 assessment was comprehensive, few clinically significant U-related health effects were observed. This report is focused on health outcomes associated with two primary target organs of concern for long term effects of this combat-related exposure to DU. Renal biomarkers showed minimal DU-related effects on proximal tubule function and cytotoxicity, but significant biomarker results were observed when urine concentrations of multiple metals also found in fragments were examined together. Pulmonary tests and questionnaire results indicate that pulmonary function after 20 y remains within the clinical normal range. Imaging of DU embedded fragment-associated tissue for signs of inflammatory or proliferative reactions possibly associated with foreign body transformation or with local alpha emissions from DU was also conducted using PET-CT and ultrasound. These imaging tools may be helpful in guiding decisions regarding removal of fragments.

Consequently, a large amount of radioactive material was accidentally released. Recently, the focus has been on quantification of environmental radioactive material. However, conventional techniques require complicated and expensive measurement equipment. In this research, the authors developed a simple method to detect environmental radioactive material with an imaging plate (IP). Two specific measurement subjects were targeted: measurements for the depth distribution of radioactive material in soil and surface contamination of a building roof. For the measurement of depth distribution of radioactive material in soil, the authors ascertained that the concentration of environmental radioactivity was highest at 5 cm below the surface, and it decreased with depth. For the measurement of surface contamination of the building roof, the authors created a contamination map of the building roof. The detector developed could contact the ground directly, and unlike other survey meters, it was not influenced by peripheral radioactivity. In this study, the authors verified the feasibility of measurement of environmental radioactivity with an IP. Although the measured values of the IP were relative, further work is planned to perform evaluations of absolute quantities of radioactive material.

The modified model was named "Mayak Worker Dosimetry System-2008'' (MWDS-2008). In contrast to earlier models developed for workers at the Mayak Production Association (Mayak PA), the new model more correctly describes plutonium biokinetics and metabolism in pulmonary lymph nodes. The MWDS-2008 also provides two sets of doses estimates: one based on bioassay data and the other based on autopsy data, where available. The algorithm of internal dose calculation from autopsy data will be described in a separate paper. Results of comparative analyses of Doses-2005 and MWDS-2008 are provided. Perspectives on the further development of plutonium dosimetry are discussed.

The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) is currently updating its biokinetic models, including the Human Respiratory Tract Model (HRTM). Gregoratto et al. (2010) proposed a physiologically-based particle transport model that simplifies significantly the representation of particle clearance from the alveolar interstitial region. Bayesian inference using the Weighted Likelihood Monte-Carlo Sampling (WeLMoS) method is applied to the bioassay and autopsy data from the U.S. Transuranium and Uranium Registries' (USTUR) tissue donors 0202 and 0407 exposed to "high fired,'' refractory PuO2 aerosols in order to examine the applicability of the revised model and to estimate the uncertainties in model parameters and the lung doses as expressed by the posterior probability distributions. It is demonstrated that, with appropriate adjustments, the Gregoratto et al. particle transport model can describe situations involving exposure to highly insoluble particles. Significant differences are observed in particle clearance pattern characteristics to these two individuals' respiratory systems. The respiratory tract of registrant 0202 was most likely compromised by his prior occupational exposure to coal dust, smoking habit, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, while donor 0407 was a non-smoker and had no prior history of lung disorder. However, the central values of the particle transport parameter posterior distributions for both cases are found to be still within the 68% probability range for the inter-subject variability derived by Gregoratto et al. PuO2 particles produced by the plutonium fire were extremely insoluble, with about 99% absorbed into blood at a rate of approximately 4.8 x 10(-6) d(-1) (Case 0202) and 5.1 x 10(-6) d(-1) (Case 0202). When considering this type of plutonium material, doses to other body organs are small in comparison to those to tissues of the respiratory tract. More than 95% of the total committed weighted equivalent dose is contributed by the lungs.

To benchmark the model, in vivo measurements were performed on the U.S. Transuranium and Uranium Registries (USTUR) case 0846 leg. Front and lateral measurements of the knee of the USTUR case 0846 leg in a bent position and the same measurements with the leg in a straight position using a HP(Ge) detector were completed. Experimental results concluded that the front measurement of the knee in a bent leg position gave the highest count rate, which is an indication of optimal detection efficiency. Therefore, this geometry and knee-detector position were considered as the most appropriate position for knee monitoring. A computational model using MCNPX version 2.6.0 was used to simulate the experimental measurements by using a leg voxel phantom. The mean value and standard deviation (SD) of peak efficiency due to an isotropic 59.5-keV photon from Am-241 were calculated in four different counting geometries. An extra sum of squares F-test was performed on the mean values of the simulated detection efficiencies. The p-value obtained from this statistical test indicates that the differences among the mean values for different counting geometries were significant. These results suggest that the front measurement of a knee in a bent leg position is the optimal counting geometry for in vivo measurement of 241Am deposited in the bones. The computational model was validated through comparison of the measured and simulated detection efficiencies. It was observed that there is no difference at the 0.1 significant levels between the simulated and measured detection efficiencies in assessment of 241Am within the bones.

J	Evans, WC				Evans, William C.			INCORRECT INTERPRETATION OF MOVING-FILTER CONTINUOUS PARTICULATE AIR MONITOR RESPONSES	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						calibration; exposure, occupational; monitoring, air; nuclear power industry		The graphs supplied by the vendors of moving-filter continuous particulate air monitors (CPAMs) in their sales literature show linear curves on a log-log scale, with net count rate on one axis and concentration on the other. The implication is that the monitor user is to read the concentration from the graph, given an observed net count rate, at any time. For the nominal filter speeds commonly used for these monitors, using the graph in this way is incorrect. The graphs do not state the limitations of the calculation: (1) the nuclide measured must be long-lived; (2) the concentration of that nuclide in the sampled air must remain constant; and (3) the reading of the net count rate must be obtained after a specific time, called the "transit time." This time is typically on the order of several hours. Reading the net count rate at any time earlier than this will result in an incorrect concentration estimate. Given that a major purpose of a CPAM is to alert plant personnel to a change in airborne radioactivity concentrations, by definition when this happens the concentration is not constant. Thus, using the supplied curves will result in an incorrect estimate of that concentration. The solution is to use instead a fixed-filter CPAM and a previously-published quantitative method. With this approach, there is no need to attempt to estimate a concentration, much less to assume that it is constant over long periods of time or that it can only change in a stair-step manner. With this alternative to a moving-filter CPAM, a signal proportional to the time-integrated worker intake can be generated continuously for any time-varying air concentration, including the sums-of-exponentials shapes expected during transient events in compartmental systems.

In this study the modeling of APEX hybrid reactor produced by using ARIES-RS hybrid reactor technology, was performed by using the Monte Carlo code and ENF/B-V-VI nuclear data. The most important feature of APEX hybrid reactor is that the first wall surrounding the plasma is liquid. The advantages of utilizing a liquid wall are high power density capacity, good power transformation productivity the magnitude of the reactor's operational duration, low failure percentage, short maintenance time and the inclusion of the system's simple technology and material.

The neutralization region of EAST neutral beam injector includes not only the gas cell neutralizer in traditional sense, but also part of the ion source downstream the electrode grid, the gate valve, and the transitional piping and fitting. The gas flow in this neutralization region has been modeled and researched using an adjusted Direct Simulation Monte Carlo code to understand the formation mechanism of gas target thickness, which determines the neutralization efficiency. This paper presents the steady-state, viscous and transition region flowfields, the gas density distribution and the various centerline profiles including Knudsen number, temperature, pressure and axial velocity by injected the deuterium gas from the arc chamber and neutralizer, respectively. The target thickness in the neutralization region as a function of gas inlet quantity is also given in the absence of beam for future operation of EAST neutral beam injector.

Low Radioactivity Fusion Reactor Based on the Spherical Tokamak with a Strong Magnetic Field	JOURNAL OF FUSION ENERGY			English	Article						D-He-3; Spherical tokamak; Fusion reactor	HE-3 PRODUCTION; CHAPTER 1; D-HE-3; FUEL	The most important feature of the spherical tokamak is the possibility of high-beta plasma confinement (beta is the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic field pressure). So, spherical tokamak can be considered as a possible confinement system for D-He-3 fusion reactor. Present paper study the ability to develop powerful D-He-3 reactor based on a spherical tokamak (fusion power about 3 GW). The following parameters are considered as optimization criteria: (1) the ratio of confinement time to the value predicted by ITER98y2 scaling; (2) the neutron flux from the plasma.

A Computational Study of a Capillary Discharge Pellet Accelerator Concept for Magnetic Fusion Fueling	JOURNAL OF FUSION ENERGY			English	Article						Fusion pellet injection; Electrothermal plasmas; Low-Z ablation capillaries	ELECTROTHERMAL PLASMA GUN; TRANSPORT CROSS-SECTION; NONIDEAL PLASMAS; DISRUPTION; GENERATION; INJECTOR; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEM; IDEAL; ITER	An ablation-dominated capillary discharge using low atomic number elements for plasma formation to flow into an ablation-free extension barrel is a concept that provides a high energy-density plasma flow sufficient to propel fuel pellets into the tokamak fusion plasma chamber. In this concept, the extension barrel is made from a non-ablating material by coating the interior wall of the barrel with nanocrystalline diamond to eliminate mixing the propelling plasma with any impurities evolving from the barrel ablation. The electrothermal plasma code ETFLOW models the plasma formation and flow in the capillary discharge and the flow into the extension barrel to accelerate frozen deuterium pellets. The code includes governing equations for both the capillary and the extension barrel, with the addition of the pellet's terms. It also includes ideal and non-ideal plasma conductivity models. The joule heating term in the energy conservation equation is only valid in the capillary section. The pellet momentum and kinetic energy are included in the governing equations of the barrel, with the addition of the effect of viscous drag terms. The electrothermal capillary source generates the plasma via the ablation of a sleeve inside the main capillary housing. The acceleration of the pellet starts in the extension barrel when the pressure of the plasma flow from the capillary reaches the release limit. The code results show pellet exit velocities in excess of 2 km/s for source/barrel systems with low-Z liner materials in the source for 5, 20, 45, and 80 mg pellets. The study shows that an increase in the length of both the source and the extension barrel increases the pellet exit velocity with the limitation of slowdown effects for plasma expansion and cooling off inside the barrel.
