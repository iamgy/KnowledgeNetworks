Development of a multi-tiered recycling strategy with a sodium-cooled Heterogeneous Innovative Burner Reactor	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Sodium-cooled fast reactor; ERANOS; VISION; Fast reactor recycle; Multi-tiered recycle		The Sodium-Cooled Heterogeneous Innovative Burner Reactor (SCHIBR) model created at the University of South Carolina uses heterogeneous minor actinide targets. To improve minor actinide transmutation, a hybrid fuel management scheme is utilized involving initially moderated assemblies on the core periphery followed by a second period of irradiation in a fast flux with the moderating rods removed. A multi-tiered recycling strategy was developed to increase plutonium utilization in the SCHIBR model through the recycle of the driver fuel. An equilibrium fuel cycle was evaluated with the computer code ERANOS to determine the improvements in fuel utilization, reduction in high level waste, and safety of the SCHIBR design. Fuel depletion studies were conducted to determine the composition of input and output streams in order to develop reactor recipes for use in the fuel cycle simulation code, VISION. The once-through SCHIBR model reduces the radiotoxicity of high level waste by 66% of the once-through LWR model after 300 years in storage. The multi-tiered recycling strategy offers improvements over the previous once-through SCHIBR model by reducing the radiotoxicity by 86% after 300 years in storage. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In the quality control routine during seed production, leakage tests are taken to detect any leakage of radioactive material from inside the titanium shield, avoiding patient contamination. Leakage tests are carried out according to the International Standard Organization - Radiation protection - sealed radioactive sources - ISO 9978. This standard recommends different methods of essay applied to radioactive seeds. The aims of this work were the study of the different leakage test methods applied to radioactive seeds recommended by the ISO 9978 and the choice of the appropriate method to be used in the seeds production. The authors evaluated five different immersion methods to detect leakage, following the standard guidance, and in some case exceeding its requirement. One hundred iodine-125 seeds were intentionally cuted, causing the release of its content. Each immersion method was applied to twenty seeds. After the immersion period, the resulting liquid activity was measured. The activity values measured in the immersion liquid indicated best results with distilled water as immersion liquid and with the application of ultrasound to the bath. The temperature of the bath ranged from 20 degrees C to 70 degrees C and the immersion time ranged from 30 min to 24 h. In this experiment, the use of scintillator liquid as immersion liquid was not effective to detect the leakage. The results allow the authors to choose the best methods to be applied in the production routine, to detect leakage in the seeds. The choice of the method will also depend on the production rhythm for schedule. In a moderate production rate, the test at 20 degrees C and 24 h immersion may be used. In a fast production rhythm, the shortest test 50 degrees C or 70 degrees C should be used. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Earlier this relationship was applied by measuring the beta(-) activity of (40) in a sample by Geiger counter. However, merely this simple linear relationship has been applied through gamma spectrometric measurement of K-40 activity, might be due to the huge interference of the K-40 background. We have demonstrated that heavily shielded Compton Suppressor System reduces the background in such extent that the total amount of K in a sample can be measured by measuring the area of the K-40 photo peak (at 1460.82 kev). The developed method requires neither chemical treatment of the sample like dissolution or digestion, nor irradiation of the sample in a nuclear reactor and therefore truly follows green chemistry principles, minimizing the chemicals and hazards. The method has been validated using NIST SRMs. The developed method was compared with WDXRF and ICPOES measurement. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Penkvilksite is a mineral which may be used in the uptake of radioactive elements. Both Raman and infrared spectroscopies identify a band at similar to 3638 cm-1 attributed to an OH-stretching vibration of hydroxyl units. The inference is that OH units are involved in the structure of penkvilksite. The formula may be well written as Na 2TiSi 4O 10(OH)2 center dot H 2O. The mineral is characterised by a very intense Raman band at 1085 cm-1 and a broad infrared band at 1080 cm-1 assigned to SiO-stretching vibrations. Raman bands at 620, 667 and 711 cm-1 are attributed to SiO and TiO chain bonds. Water-stretching vibrations are observed as Raman bands at 3197, 3265, 3425 and 3565 cm-1. Vibrational spectroscopy enables aspects of the molecular structure of the mineral penkvilksite to be ascertained. Penkvilksite is a mineral which can incorporate actinides and lanthanides from radioactive waste.

Neutronic evaluations for MNSR research reactor core conversion from HEU to LEU	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						MNSR; Core conversion; Neutronic calculations; High density fuels	SYSTEM; CODE	We studied enrichment reduction evaluations for Iranian Miniature Neutron Source Reactor (MNSR) preserving prior reactivity limitations. Utilization of high density Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) fuels such as UO2. U3Si2 and U9Mo have been addressed from neutronics point of view. The Monte Carlo code MCNP4C has been used for studying the reactor core neutronic parameters. The feasibility of candidate LEU fuels have been validated via the MNSR reference fuel parameters. The results show that the average neutron flux in irradiation channels of LEU core configurations is reduce within 7%. According to the calculated reactivity parameters and thermal neutron flux in irradiation channels, this reduction would not affect the reactor safety as well as its applicability.

From the results of irradiation analyses of DU, it was confirmed that there is a strong dependence of transmutation behavior of DU on the ratio of neutron flux in the resonance region to the total neutron flux, namely resonance neutron ratio, even in a fast reactor. Also, it was confirmed that there is a strong effect of sample material form and shape on generated Pu nuclide inventory especially near the reflector area (>20% resonance neutron ratio), because of the intensive self-shielding of U-238, though less is expected for Am-241. Sensitivity study of hypothetical DU-Am oxide fuel pellet irradiation on neutron energy and burn-up was performed to evaluate significant gradient of radial Pu-238 isotopic composition profile (e.g., from 12% to 18% distribution in 3% Am doping, in 30% resonance neutron ratio and in the neutron fluence of 4.0 x 10(22) n/cm(2) inside a large pellet with softened neutron spectrum), and vulnerability of the fuel pellet surface in terms of Pu denaturing was revealed. Design consideration of radial zoning of Am-241 content was introduced to flatten the radial distribution of isotopic composition of Pu. The results of radial zoning of Am-241 (4% and 3% Am in the outer and inner zone of DU-Am oxide fuel pellet) in hypothetical irradiation neutronics analysis showed the radial profile of produced Pu is over 15 at.% of Pu-238 isotopic composition in any zone and meets the criterion of Kimura et al. based on decay heat of Pu to impede utilization to fission explosive devices.

Gamma rays were counted by a NaI(TI) detector with a resolution of 122 keV at 662 key. The study reveals that the concretes under research are effective than ordinary concrete for the attenuation of gamma rays. It was determined that the values of mean free path decreased with the increasing concentration of barite and colemanite and the linear attenuation coefficients increased with the increasing concentration of barite and colemanite in the concrete. Theoretical values were obtained by using Penelope and WinXCom computer programs and these were compared with the experimental results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A numerical study of flow and mixing characteristics inside the chimney structure of a pool type research reactor	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Chimney structure; k-epsilon Turbulence model; Mixing; Stagnation depth		Numerical studies were performed to examine the effects of flow velocities of opposing streams on the flow pattern and turbulent mixing characteristics in a three-dimensional chimney structure using CFD code PHOENICS. This chimney structure facilitates guiding of the radioactive water from the reactor core (i.e., core flow) towards the side outlet nozzles and simultaneously drawing out water from the reactor pool through the chimney top. The radioactive water flows upward and has a tendency to reach to the pool top through the chimney top which is open for fuel and isotope handling. The chimney design allows drawing out a part of the pool water in the downward direction to suppress the upward flowing radioactive water jet. This downward flow through the chimney is compensated by providing additional core bypass flow to the pool. Analyses were carried out on 1:1 chimney structure and also on 1/6th scaled down chimney model to understand the similarity of behaviour of the model and the prototype. Mass flow rate of upward flowing water (i.e. core flow) is considered to be 750 kg/s and core bypass flow is varied from 0% to 15% that of the core flow. In the model study, mass flow rate was varied from 8.33 to 25 kg/s and core bypass flow was considered to vary from 0% to 15%. Flow mixing pattern inside the chimney and the non-dimensional stagnation depth was predicted for the model and the prototype. It was observed that there is a good similarity in behaviour of the prototype and model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

One of the concepts that is being studied is the High Performance Light Water Reactor (HPLWR) which is the European version of the SCWR. For this reactor. neutronics calculations have been performed with MCNP/MCNP5/MCNP4B/MCNPX4C and the results obtained are used as reference. However. MCNP calculations take too much computing time for design or fuel management analysis: therefore, it was decided to explore the factibility of using the HELIOS-2 code given that the computing time required for the simulations is notably reduced. The main objective of this work is to develop a model for the HPLWR fuel with HELIOS-2, and to subsequently compare the results against the MCNPX, in order to use the HELIOS-2 for performing further reactor physics studies given that although MCNPX is better HELIOS-2 is faster. Several variables, which are essential in the neutronics design of any reactor, were compared, that means: the infinite neutron multiplication factor (k(infinity)), the pin power distribution, and the power peaking factor for the fuel assembly, in hot and cold conditions, as well as the fuel reactivity coefficients. Calculations were made for a square fuel assembly with two rows of fuel pins, some of them containing gadolinia (Gd2O3) as burnable absorber material. The tests were simulated for different gadolinia enrichments as well as for no gadolinia. The calculations were done with the total reflection condition. The results show good similarities between the deterministic HELIOS-2 and the stochastic MCNPX calculations for the selected fuel assembly. Almost all values of the maximum power peaking factor obtained from MCNPX and HELIOS-2 are very similar to each other. Regarding the k(infinity) values, the maximum relative difference (considering fuel temperature variations between 400 and 1200 K) is 564 pcm Delta k/k for a coolant density of 0.74 g/cm(3) and 1200 K. According to results, the HELIOS-2 code is good enough to be used in neutronics simulations of a HPLWR. In regards to reactivity coefficients, due to fuel temperature variations, we obtained similar results with both codes. We concluded that HELIOS-2 can be used for making HPLWR analysis faster than MCNPX. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Along the years, a lot of work has been done in this area. In particular, several metaheuristic optimization techniques have been applied with good results for boiling water reactors (BWRs). In this paper, a comparison of different metaheuristics: genetic algorithms, tabu search, recurrent neural networks and several ant colony optimization techniques, were applied, in order to evaluate their performance. The optimization of an equilibrium core of a BWR, loaded with mixed oxide fuel composed of plutonium and minor actinides, was selected to be optimized. Results show that the best average values are obtained with the recurrent neural networks technique, meanwhile the best fuel reload was obtained with tabu search. However, according to the number of objective functions evaluated, the two fastest optimization techniques are tabu search and Ant System. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Jeffrey			REEVALUATION OF Am-241 CONTENT IN THE USTUR CASE 0102 LEG PHANTOM	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						contamination, internal; counting efficiency; detector, germanium; Monte Carlo		The Am-241 contents in the United States Transuranium and Uranium Registries' (USTUR) case 0102 leg phantom were previously estimated to be 1,243 +/- 11 Bq. Recent analysis of the computed tomography images of the phantom revealed multiple bone structures missing from various regions of the phantom skeleton including: posterior ilium, anterior ilium, ischium, femur proximal end, femur middle shaft, femur distal end, patella, tibia distal shaft, fibula distal shaft, and fibula distal end. Additionally, the fifth metatarsal and all of the fifth-digit phalanges were found to be completely missing from the foot. A three-dimensional (3D) model of the leg phantom was created using 3D-Doctor software. Volumes of missing bone structures were outlined separately based on the anatomical assessment of those structures. Weights of the missing bone samples were calculated. Consequently, the value of total Am-241 activity in the USTUR leg phantom is 1,218 +/- 11 Bq. This activity is about 2.0% less than the previously published value of 1,243 +/- 11 Bq. External gamma detector response was simulated considering both activity values (1,243 and 1,218 Bq) across the five different locations along the USTUR leg phantom: foot, middle leg, knee, middle thigh, and hip. Each counting position was chosen such that it was above the missing bone structure locations. The highest difference observed between the two counting efficiencies (each corresponding to the two different quantities of estimated activity) was 8.2% and 9.4% for locations above the foot and middle thigh, respectively. Other counting locations (middle leg, knee, and hip) showed efficiency variations of about 1%.

BAYESIAN ANALYSES OF TIME-INTERVAL DATA FOR ENVIRONMENTAL RADIATION MONITORING	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						analysis; statistical; monitoring; environmental; Monte Carlo; radiation; low-level	LOW-LEVEL RADIOACTIVITY; PROBABILITY RATIO TEST; STATISTICS	Time-interval (time difference between two consecutive pulses) analysis based on the principles of Bayesian inference was investigated for online radiation monitoring. Using experimental and simulated data, Bayesian analysis of time-interval data [Bayesian (ti)] was compared with Bayesian and a conventional frequentist analysis of counts in a fixed count time [Bayesian (cnt) and single interval test (SIT), respectively]. The performances of the three methods were compared in terms of average run length (ARL) and detection probability for several simulated detection scenarios. Experimental data were acquired with a DGF-4C system in list mode. Simulated data were obtained using Monte Carlo techniques to obtain a random sampling of the Poisson distribution. All statistical algorithms were developed using the R Project for statistical computing. Bayesian analysis of time-interval information provided a similar detection probability as Bayesian analysis of count information, but the authors were able to make a decision with fewer pulses at relatively higher radiation levels. In addition, for the cases with very short presence of the source (< count time), time-interval information is more sensitive to detect a change than count information since the source data is averaged by the background data over the entire count time. The relationships of the source time, change points, and modifications to the Bayesian approach for increasing detection probability are presented.

However, information regarding activity concentrations and radon (Rn-222) and thoron (Rn-220) exhalation rates for such rocks is very scarce. Therefore, samples of the granite, andesite, tuff, and marble that are used as wall coverings in Japan were collected from mining companies, and their activity concentrations and Rn-222 and Rn-220 exhalation rates were measured. Dose estimations for inhabitants living in houses built with these materials were also carried out. The activity concentration of natural radionuclides in all the materials was lower than the critical values described by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (10,000 Bq kg(-1) for K-40 and 1,000 Bq kg(-1) for all other radionuclides of natural origin). The maximum values of Rn-222 and Rn-220 mass exhalation rates for the granite samples were 0.12 and 430 mBq kg(-1) s(-1), and those for the area exhalation rates were 1.8 and 6300 mBq m(-2) s(-1), respectively; these values are higher than those for other samples. The maximum value of effective doses to inhabitants was 0.68 mSv y(-1), which is lower than the intervention exemption level (1 mSv y(-1)) given in the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) Publication 82.

J	Khalaf, M; Brey, RR; Meldrum, J				Khalaf, Majid; Brey, Richard R.; Meldrum, Jeff			A NEW LEG VOXEL MODEL IN TWO DIFFERENT POSITIONS FOR SIMULATION OF THE NON-UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION OF Am-241 IN LEG BONES	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						Am-241; bones; human; calibration; phantom	PHANTOMS	A new leg voxel model in two different positions (straight and bent) has been developed for in vivo measurement calibration purposes. This voxel phantom is a representation of a human leg that may provide a substantial enhancement to Monte Carlo modeling because it more accurately models different geometric leg positions and the non-uniform distribution of Am-241 throughout the leg bones instead of assuming a one-position geometry and a uniform distribution of radionuclides. This was accomplished by performing a radiochemical analysis on small sections of the leg bones from the U.S. Transuranium and Uranium Registries (USTUR) case 0846. USTUR case 0846 represents an individual who was repeatedly contaminated by Am-241 via chronic inhalation. To construct the voxel model, high resolution (2 mm) computed tomography (CT) images of the USTUR case 0846 leg were obtained in different positions. Thirty-six (36) objects (universes) were segmented manually from the CT images using 3D-Doctor software. Bones were divided into 30 small sections with an assigned weight exactly equal to the weight of bone sections obtained from radiochemical analysis of the USTUR case 0846 leg. The segmented images were then converted into a boundary file, and the Human Monitoring Laboratory (HML) voxelizer was used to convert the boundary file into the leg voxel phantom. Excluding the surrounding air regions, the straight leg phantom consists of 592,023 voxels, while the bent leg consists of 337,567 voxels. The resulting leg voxel model is now ready for use as an MCNPX input file to simulate in vivo measurement of boneseeking radionuclides.

In five of these six USTUR cases, the percentage of Am-241 deposited in the knee region as well as in the entire leg was separately calculated relative to total skeletal activity. The purpose of this study is to find a region in the leg that is both suitable for in vivo measurement of Am-241 deposited in the bones and has a good correlation with the total skeletal Am-241 burden. In all analyzed cases, the femur was the bone with the highest percentage of Am-241 deposited in the leg (48.8%). In the five cases that have complete whole skeletal analysis, the percentage of Am-241 activity in the knee relative to entire skeletal activity was 4.8%, and the average value of its coefficient of variation was 10.6%. The percentage of Am-241 in the leg relative to total skeletal activity was 20% with an average coefficient of variation of 13.63%. The Am-241 activity in the knee as well as in the leg was strongly correlated (R-2 = 99.5% and R-2 = 99.1%, respectively) with the amount of Am-241 activity in the entire skeleton using a simple linear relationship. The highest correlation was found between the amount of Am-241 deposited in the knee and the amount of Am-241 deposited in the entire skeleton. This correlation is important because it might enable an accurate assessment of the total skeletal Am-241 burden to be performed from in vivo monitoring of the knee region. In all analyzed cases, an excellent correlation (R-2 = 99.9%) was found between the amount of Am-241 activity in the knee and the amount of Am-241 activity in the entire leg. The results of this study suggest three simple models: two models to predict the total skeletal activity based on either leg or knee activity, and the third model to predict the total leg activity based on knee activity. The results also suggest that the knee region is a suitable position for in vivo measurements of Am-241 deposited in the bones and also for an accurate and efficient detection system. Detector efficiency should be apparently calibrated based on only the Am-241 burden in the knee region bones instead of Am-241 activity deposited in the entire leg.

Rusty			IMPROVING THE PRESAGE (R) POLYMER RADIOSENSITIVITY FOR HOT CELL AND GLOVEBOX 3D CHARACTERIZATION	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						computed tomography; computer calculations; decontamination; gamma radiation	RADIATION; DOSIMETER	RadBall (R) is a novel, passive, radiation detection device that provides 3D mapping of radiation from areas where measurements have not been possible previously due to lack of access or extremely high radiation doses. This kind of technology is beneficial when decommissioning and decontamination of nuclear facilities occur. The key components of the RadBall (R) technology include a tungsten outer shell that houses a radio-sensitive PRESAGE (R) polymer. The 1.0-cm-thick tungsten shell has a number of holes that allow photons to reach the polymer, thus generating radiation tracks that are analyzed to characterize the radiation sources within the contaminated area being considered. Facilities being mapped frequently have to be shut down to minimize radiation exposures to workers; therefore, reducing the mapping or characterization time is significant. The objective of this study was to reduce the RadBall (R) deployment time by increasing the radiosensitivity of the PRESAGE (R) formulation. The new formulation is four times more radiosensitive than the original formulation. Consequently, RadBall (R) deployment times can be reduced fourfold, which is a considerable improvement.

Compared with the commonly adopted detection methods incorporated with statistical theory, the sequential Bayesian approach offers the advantages of shorter verification time during the analysis of spectra that contain low total counts, especially in complex radionuclide components. In this paper, a simulation experiment platform implanted with the methodology of sequential Bayesian approach was developed. Events sequences of gamma-rays associating with the true parameters of a LaBr3(Ce) detector were obtained based on an events sequence generator using Monte Carlo sampling theory to study the performance of the sequential Bayesian approach. The numerical experimental results are in accordance with those of Candy. Moreover, the relationship between the detection model and the event generator, respectively represented by the expected detection rate (A(m)) and the tested detection rate (G(m)) parameters, is investigated. To achieve an optimal performance for this processor, the interval of the tested detection rate as a function of the expected detection rate is also presented. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
