A detection system for charged-particle decay studies with a continuous-implantation method	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						beta-delayed proton decay; Direct proton decay; Double-sided silicon strip detector; Continuous-beam mode; Implantation-decay correlation	DELAYED-PROTON-DECAY; MULTIPLET MASS EQUATION; BETA-DECAY; SI-24; SPECTROSCOPY; ISOTOPE; NUCLEI; ARRAY; LINE	A new detection system with high detection efficiency and low detection threshold has been developed for charged-particle decay studies, including beta-delayed proton, alpha decay or direct proton emission from proton-rich nuclei. The performance was evaluated by using the beta-delayed proton emitter Si-24 produced by projectile fragmentation at the First Radioactive Ion Beam Line in Lanzhou. Under a continuous-beam mode, the isotopes of interest were implanted into two double-sided silicon strip detectors, where the subsequent decays were measured and correlated to the preceding implantations by using position and time information. The system allows us to measure protons with energies down to about 200 keV without obvious 13 background in the proton spectrum. Further application of the detection system can be extended to the measurements of beta-delayed proton decay and the direct proton emission of more exotic proton-rich nuclei. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Development of a low-cost-high-sensitivity Compton camera using CsI (Tl) scintillators (gamma I)	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Gamma-ray imaging; Compton camera; Csl (TI); Scintillator; Fukushima; Radioactive cesium	GENERATION; ARRAYS	We have developed a novel low-cost gamma-ray imaging Compton camera gamma I that has a high detection efficiency. Our motivation for the development of this detector was to measure the arrival directions of gamma rays produced by radioactive nuclides that were released by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident in 2011. The detector comprises two arrays of inorganic scintillation detectors, which act as a scatterer and an absorber. Each array has eight scintillation detectors, each comprising a large CsI (TI) scintillator cube of side 3.5 cm, which is inexpensive and has a good energy resolution. Energies deposited by the Compton scattered electrons and subsequent photoelectric absorption, measured by each scintillation counter, are used for image reconstruction. The angular resolution was found to be 3.5 after using an image-sharpening technique. With this angular resolution, we can resolve a 1 m(2) radiation hot spot that is located at a distance of 10 m from the detector with a wide field of view of 1 sr. Moreover, the detection efficiency 0.68 cps/MBq at 1 m for 662 keV (7.6 cps/mu Sv/h) is sufficient for measuring low-level contamination (i.e., less than 1 mu Sv/h) corresponding to typical values in large areas of eastern Japan. In addition to the laboratory tests, the imaging capability of our detector was verified in various regions with dose rates less than 1 mu Sv/h (e.g., Fukushima city). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It includes a driver superconducting (SC) linac for producing 200 MeV/u and 400 kW continuous wave (CW) heavy ion beams from protons to uranium. The RAON consists of a few electron cyclotron resonance ion sources, a low-energy beam transport (LEBT) system, a CW 81.25 MHz, 500 keV/u radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) accelerator, a medium-energy beam transport system, the SC linac, and a charge-stripper system. The LEBT system for the RISP accelerator facility consists of a high-voltage platform, two 90 dipoles, a multi-harmonic buncher (MHB), solenoids, electrostatic quadrupoles, a velocity equalizer, and a diagnostic system. The ECR ion sources are located on a high-voltage platform to reach an initial beam energy of 10 keV/u. After extraction, the ion beam is transported through the LEBT system to the RFQ accelerator. The generated charge states are selected by an achromatic bending system and then bunched by the MHB in the LEBT system. The MHB is used to achieve a small longitudinal emittance in the RFQ by generating a sawtooth wave with three harmonics. In this paper, we present the results and issues of the beam dynamics of the LEBT system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thermal neutron background measurement in CJPL	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Thermal neutron background; Underground laboratory; CDEX; DAQ; He-3 proportional tube	COUNTERS; EMISSION; HE-3	This paper describes the measurement of thermal neutron flux in the CJPL underground laboratory in the proximity of the CDEX experiment. A low background thermal neutron detection system is designed which applies a combination of a He-3 proportional tube and a He-4 proportional tube as the detector. Thermal neutrons can be captured by the He-3 proportional tube while the He-4 proportional tube is for the purpose of background measurement. The tube wall is made up of oxygen-free copper to reduce the background due to radioactivity of the wall material. The electronics readout system has been developed to store triggered events' waveforms so as to get the amplitude spectrum and monitor the data quality. We observed an average thermal neutron flux of Phi = 4.00 +/- 0.08 x 10(-6)/cm(2) s in the CJPL experiment hall in the proximity of CDEX experiment and the neutron and background events both distribute uniformly along the tube.

Measurements of response functions of EJ-299-33A plastic scintillator for fast neutrons	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Fast neutron measurements; EJ-299-33A scintillator; Pulse-shape discrimination; Neutron spectroscopy	PULSE-SHAPE DISCRIMINATION; CALIBRATION	Monoenergetic neutron response functions were measured for an EJ-299-33A plastic scintillator. The 7-MV Van de Graaff accelerator at the University of Kentucky Accelerator Laboratory was used to produce proton and deuteron beams for reactions with gaseous tritium and deuterium targets, yielding mono-energetic neutrons by means of the H-3(p,n)He-3, H-2(d,n)He-3, and H-3(d,n)He-4 reactions. The neutron energy was selected by tuning the charged-particle's energy and using the angular dependence of the neutron emission. The resulting response functions were measured for 0.1-MeV steps in neutron energy from 0.1 MeV to 8.2 MeV and from 12.2 MeV to 20.2 MeV. Experimental data were processed using a procedure for digital pulse-shape discrimination, which allowed characterization of the response functions of the plastic scintillator to neutrons only. The response functions are intended for use in neutron spectrum unfolding methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Performance of a fast acquisition system for in-beam PET monitoring tested with clinical proton beams	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Hadrontherapy monitoring; Positron Emission Tomography; Scintillation detectors; Silicon photomultipliers	RANGE VERIFICATION; THERAPY	In this work we present the performance of a fast acquisition system for in-beam PET monitoring during the irradiation of a PMMA phantom with a clinical proton beam. The experimental set-up was based on 4 independent detection modules. Two detection modules were placed at one side of a PMMA phantom and the other two modules were placed at the opposite side of the phantom. One detection module was composed of a Silicon Photon Multiplier produced by AdvanSiD coupled to a single scintillating LYSO crystal. The read-out system was based on the TOFPET ASIC managed by a Xilinx ML605 FPGA Evaluation Board (Virtex 6). The irradiation of the PMMA phantom was performed at the CNAO hadrontherapy facility (Pavia, Italy) with a 95 MeV pulsed proton beam. The pulsed time structure of the proton beam was reconstructed by each detection module. The beta(+) annihilation peak was successfully measured and the production of beta(+) isotopes emitters was observed as increasing number of 511 keV events detected during irradiation. Finally, after the irradiation, the half lives of the C-11 and O-15 radioactive isotopes were estimated. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Piliero, M. A.; Bisogni, M.

J	Wang, HT; Enqvist, A				Wang, Haitang; Enqvist, Andreas			Pulse height model for deuterated scintillation detectors	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Light pulse distribution; Deuterated scintillation detectors; Pulse shape discrimination; EJ-315	LIQUID SCINTILLATORS; NEUTRON DETECTION; SPECTRUM	An analytical model of light pulse height distribution for finite deuterated scintillation detectors is created using the impulse approximation. Particularly, the energy distribution of a scattered neutron is calculated based on an existing collision probability scheme for general cylindrical shaped detectors considering double differential cross-sections. The light pulse height distribution is analytically and numerically calculated by convoluting collision sequences with the light output function for an EJ-315 detector from our measurements completed at Ohio University. The model provides a good description of collision histories capturing transferred neutron energy in deuterium-based scintillation materials. The resulting light pulse height distribution details pulse compositions and their corresponding contributions, It shows that probabilities of neutron collision with carbon and deuterium nuclei are comparable, however the light pulse amplitude due to collisions with carbon nuclei is small and mainly located at the lower region of the light pulse distribution axis. The model can explore those neutron interaction events that generate pulses near or below a threshold that would be imposed in measurements. A comparison is made between the light pulse height distributions given by the analytical model and measurements It reveals a significant probability of a neutron generating a small light pulse due to collisions with carbon nuclei when compared to larger light pulse generated by collisions involving deuterium nuclei. This model is beneficial to understand responses of scintillation materials and pulse compositions, as well as nuclei information extraction from recorded pulses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Heraltova, L				Heraltova, L.			Possibility of implementation of 6-year fuel cycle at NPP with VVER-440 reactor	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							BURNABLE ABSORBER	This paper discusses possibility of an extension of a fuel cycle at a VVER-440 reactor for up to 6 years. The prolongation of a fuel cycle was realized by optimization of a fuel design and increasing of a fuel enrichment. The modified design of the fuel assembly covers change of pellet geometry, decreasing of parasitic absorption in construction materials, improved moderation of fuel pins and also increase of enrichment. Fuel assemblies with enrichment up to 7% U-235 are considered for prolonged fuel batches. Three different batch lengths were considered for evaluation of core properties - 12,18 and 24 months, and two types of burnable absorbers were included - Gd2O3 and Er2O3. Comparison of proposed fuel assemblies was realized by length of a batch, average burnup, maximal power of fuel assembly or fuel pin, control fuel assembly worth, reactivity coefficients, and effective delayed neutrons fraction. Comparison of characteristics of a burned fuel discharged from a reactor core is discussed in the last part of the paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The SFPR meso-scale models include an extended set of microscopic parameters, characterizing the crystal defect structure, thermo-physical and thermochemical properties of irradiated fuel. Increasing computational capabilities and rapid development of effective interatomic potentials allow micro-scale representations of the materials and physics to inform via meso-scale code the macro-level simulation. The first examples of atomistic calculations (by molecular dynamics and Monte-Carlo methods) of the key microscopic parameters for input in SFPR and BERKUT, validation of the modified code and application of the 3D finite element method for improvement and verification of the 1D thermo-mechanical model, are presented.

J	Motalab, MA; Kim, W; Kim, Y				Motalab, Mohammad Abdul; Kim, Woosong; Kim, Yonghee			Evaluation of CANDU6 PCR (power coefficient of reactivity) with a 3-D whole-core Monte Carlo Analysis	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							SCATTERING	The power coefficient of reactivity (PCR) is a very important parameter for inherent safety and stability of nuclear reactors. The combined effect of a relatively less negative fuel temperature coefficient and a positive coolant temperature coefficient make the CANDU6 (CANada Deuterium Uranium) PCR very close to zero. In the original CANDU6 design, the PCR was calculated to be clearly negative. However, the latest physics design tools predict that the PCR is slightly positive for a wide operational range of reactor power. It is upon this contradictory observation that the CANDU6 PCR is re-evaluated in this work. In our previous study, the CANDU6 PCR was evaluated through a standard lattice analysis at mid-burnup and was found to be negative at low power. In this paper, the study was extended to a detailed 3-D CANDU6 whole-core model using the Monte Carlo code Serpent2. The Doppler broadening rejection correction (DBRC) method was implemented in the Serpent2 code in order to take into account thermal motion of the heavy uranium nucleus in the neutron-U scattering reactions. Time-average equilibrium core was considered for the evaluation of the representative PCR of CANDU6. Two thermal hydraulic models were considered in this work: one at design condition and the other at operating condition. Bundle-wise distributions of the coolant properties are modeled and the bundle-wise fuel temperature is also considered in this study. The evaluated nuclear data library ENDF/B-VII.0 was used throughout this Serpent2 evaluation. In these Monte Carlo calculations, a large number of neutron histories were simulated to reduce standard deviation of the k-effective values to similar to 1 pcm. The evaluated PCRs were compared with the official PCR value of the CANDU6 core calculated by RFSP-IST code. It was found that the CANDU6 PCR can be clearly negative at low power ranges for both design and operating conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The influence of EDTA on ultrafiltration of low level radioactive wastewater (LLRW) was investigated under different operation conditions. As the main organic pollutant, EDTA led to unrecoverable membrane fouling and the normalized flux decreased from 100% to 85% depending on its concentration. The clogging caused by EDTA increased the surface roughness of the membrane, leading to the flux reduction. Both nuclide rejections and depositions on the membrane surfaces were enhanced with EDTA addition, due to the strong complexation of the nuclides with EDTA. However, Ag deposition on the membrane decreased slightly in the presence of EDTA, which may be caused by the stronger attraction of Ag to the unmodified membrane than that to the EDTA-modified one. Transmembrane pressure (TMP) and molecular weight cut off (MWCO) of membranes had negligible effects on membrane fouling, while the nuclide rejections by membrane and the depositions of nuclides on membrane both decreased significantly when the TMP increased to 0.2 MPa and MWCO increased from 5 kDa to 30 kDa. Based on these results, it clearly showed that EDTA even at a low concentration had strong effects on the performance of UF treating LLRW. Therefore, it is suggested for industrial application that pretreatments to reduce EDTA or alkaline/ultrasonic washing involved in UF process were necessary to reduce the nuclide depositions on the membrane surfaces and irradiation dose of membrane surface.

Fully coupled multiphysics modeling of enhanced thermal conductivity UO2-BeO fuel performance in a light water reactor	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							IRRADIATED UO2 FUEL; THERMOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES; BEHAVIOR; CODE; RECOMMENDATIONS; TEMPERATURE; ZIRCALOY-4; KINETICS; OXIDES; CREEP	Commercial light water reactor fuel UO2 has a low thermal conductivity that leads to the development of a large temperature gradient across the fuel pellet, limiting the reactor operational performance due to the effects that include thermal stresses causing pellet cladding interaction and the release of fission product gases. This study presents the development of a modeling and simulation for enhanced thermal conductivity UO2-BeO fuel behavior in a light water reactor, using self-defined multiple physics models fully coupled based on the framework of COMSOL Multiphysics. Almost all the related physical models are considered, including heat generation and conduction, species diffusion, thermomechanics (thermal expansion, elastic strain, densification, and fission product swelling strain), grain growth, fission gas production and release, gap heat transfer, mechanical contact, gap/plenum pressure with plenum volume, cladding thermal and irradiation creep and oxidation. All the phenomenal models and materials properties are implemented into COMSOL Multiphysics finite-element platform with a 2D axisymmetric geometry of a fuel pellet and cladding. UO2-BeO enhanced thermal conductivity nuclear fuel would decrease fuel temperatures and facilitate a reduction in pellet cladding interaction from our simulation results through lessening thermal stresses that result in fuel cracking, relocation, and swelling, so that the safety of the reactor would be improved.

Reducing the fuel temperature for pressure-tube supercritical-water-cooled reactors and the effect of fuel burnup	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								The Pressure-Tube Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor (PT-SCWR) is one of the concepts under investigation by the Generation IV International Forum for its promise to deliver higher thermal efficiency than nuclear reactors currently in operation. The high coolant temperature (>625 K) and high linear power density employed by the PT-SCWR cause the fuel temperature to be fairly high, leading to a reduced margin to fuel melting, thus increasing the risk of actual melting during accident scenarios. It is therefore desirable to come up with a fuel design that lowers the fuel temperature while preserving the high linear power ratio and high coolant temperature. One possible solution is to separate the fertile (ThO2) and fissile (PuO2) fuel materials into different radial regions in each fuel pin. Previously-reported work found that by locating the fertile material at the centre and the fissile material at the periphery of the fuel pin, the fuel centreline temperature can be reduced by 650 K for fresh fuel compared to the case of a homogeneous (Th-Pu)O-2 mixture for the same coolant temperature and linear power density. This work provides a justification for the observed reduction in fuel centreline temperature and suggests a systematic approach to lower the fuel temperature. It also extends the analysis to the dependence of the radial temperature profile on fuel burnup. The radial temperature profile is determined from the analytical solution of the steady-state heat conduction equation in the fuel pin, ignoring azimuthal dependence and axial heat flow. The temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity is accounted for, as is the radial dependence of the volumetric power density, which is determined from detailed lattice-level transport calculations performed using the lattice code DRAGON. The reduction in the centreline fuel temperature is shown to be caused partly by a reduction in the heat flux in the case of the two-region fuel and partly by the higher thermal conductivity of both pure ThO2 and pure PuO2 compared to that of a ThO2-PuO2 mixture. The centreline temperature of the two-region fuel is shown to be higher for irradiated fuel than for fresh fuel, a fact explained by the depletion of the fissile material in the peripheral region and the buildup of fissile material in the central region.

J	Mohamed, NMA				Mohamed, Nader M. A.			Design of a PWR for long cycle and direct recycling of spent fuel	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								In a previous work, a new design was proposed for the Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) fuel assembly for direct use of the PWR spent fuel without processing. The proposed assembly has four zircaloy-4 tubes contains a number of 61-element CANDU fuel bundles (8 bundles per tube) stacked end to end. The space between the tubes contains 44 lower enriched UO2 fuel rods and 12 guide tubes. In this paper, this assembly is used to build a single batch loading 36-month PWR and the spent CANDU bundles are recycled in the on power refueling CANDU reactors. The Advanced PWR (APWR) is considered as a reference design. The average enrichment in the core is 4.76%w U-235. IFBA and Gd2O3 as burnable poisons are used for controlling the excess reactivity and to flatten the power distribution. The calculations using MCNPX showed that the PWR will discharge the fuel with average burnup of 31.8 MWd/kgU after 1000 effective full power days. Assuming a 95 days plant outage, 36 calendar months can be achieved with a capacity factor of 91.3%. Good power distribution in the core is obtained during the cycle and the required critical boron concentration is less than 1750 ppm. Recycling of the discharged CANDU fuel bundles that represents 85% of the fuel in the assembly, in CANDU-6 or in 700 MWe Advanced CANDU Reactor (ACR-700), an additional burnup of about 31 or 26 MWd/kgU burnup can be achieved, respectively. Averaging the fuel burnup on the all fuel in the PWR assembly, 58 or 54 MWd/kgU burnup of the fuel can be achieved, respectively. Comparing this fuel cycle strategy with that of the advanced pressurized water reactors such as AP-1000 and EPR, we find that almost the same burnup can be achieved with longer core cycle: 36 months versus 18 months for these reactors. Recycling these fuel bundles in CANDU-6 reactors requires minimizing the lattice pitch to 22 cm. In order to keep the coolant void reactivity of the ACR-700 slightly negative, the calandria tube should be increased from 7.8 cm to 8.2 cm to decrease the moderator to fuel volume ratio.

Incorporation of oxygen in SiC implanted with hydrogen	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						SiC; Hydrogen; Ion implantation; SIMS; Oxygen gettering	CZOCHRALSKI SILICON; CAVITIES; ACCUMULATION; TECHNOLOGY; DIFFUSION; HELIUM; COPPER	Oxygen accumulation at buried implantation-damage layers was studied after post-implantation annealing of hydrogen- or deuterium-implanted 4H-SiC. In this study H+ or H-2(+) implantation was carried out at energies E, from 200 keV to 1 MeV, to fluences D, ranging from 2 x 10(16)/cm(2) to 1 x 10(17)/cm(2). For comparison, the implantation was also done into float-zone (FZ) and Czochralski (CZ) silicon wafers. Post-implantation annealing at temperatures from 400 degrees C to 1150 degrees C was performed either in pure argon or in a water vapor. Characterization methods included SIMS, RBS and TEM. At sufficiently high doses, hydrogen implantation into semiconductors leads to the irreversible formation of a planar zone of microcavities, bubbles and other extended defects located at the maximum of deposited energy. This kind of highly perturbed layer, containing large amounts of agglomerated hydrogen is known to efficiently getter a number of impurities. Oxygen was detected in both CZ and FZ silicon subjected to Smart-Cut (TM) processing. We have identified, by SIMS profiling, a considerable oxygen peak situated at the interface between the SiC substrate and a layer implanted with 1 x 10(17) H ions/cm(2) and heated to 1150 degrees C in either H2O vapor or in a nominally pure Ar. In view of a lack of convincing evidence that a hexagonal SiC might contain substantial amounts of oxygen, the objective of the present study was to identify the source and possible transport mechanism of oxygen species to the cavity band. Through the analysis of several implants annealed at various conditions, we conclude that, besides diffusion from the bulk or from surface oxides, an alternative path for oxygen agglomeration is migration of gaseous O-2 or H2O from the edge of the sample through the porous layer.

Heavy and light ion irradiation damage effects in delta-phase Sc4Hf3O12	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Irradiation damage effects; Phase transformation; TEM; GIXRD	NUCLEAR-WASTE; DISORDER; PYROCHLORE; PLUTONIUM; IMMOBILIZATION; TRANSFORMATION; TRANSITION; GD2TI2O7; FORM	Polycrystalline delta-phase Sc4Hf3O12 was irradiated with light and heavy ions to study the radiation stability of this compound. In order to explore the ion species spectrum effect, the irradiations were performed with 400 key Ne2+ ions to fluences ranging from 1 x 10(14) to 1 x 10(15) ions/cm(2), 600 keV Kr3+ ions to fluences ranging from 5 x 10(14) to 5 x 10(15) ions/cm(2), and 6 MeV Xe26+ ions to fluences ranging from 2 x 10(13) to 1 x 10(15) ions/cm(2). Irradiated samples were characterized by various techniques including grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A complete phase transformation from ordered rhombohedral to disordered fluorite was observed by a fluence of 1 x 10(15) ions/cm(2) with 400 keV Ne2+ ions, equivalent to a peak ballistic damage dose of similar to 0.33 displacements per atom (dpa). Meanwhile, the same transformation was also observed by 600 keV Kr3+ ions at the same fluence of 1 x 10(15) ions/cm(2), which however corresponds to a peak ballistic damage dose of similar to 2.2 dpa. Only a partial O-D transformation was observed for 6 MeV Xe26+ ions in the fluence range used. Experimental results indicated that the O-D transformation is observed under both electronic and nuclear stopping dominant irradiation regimes. It was also observed that light ions are more efficient than heavy ions in producing the retained defects that are presumably responsible for the O-D phase transformation. The O-D transformation mechanism is discussed in the context of anion oxygen Frenkel defects and cation antisite defects. We concluded that the irradiation induced O-D transformation is easier to occur in delta-phase compounds with partial order of cations than in that with fully disordered cation structures.

Modifications of structural and physical properties induced by swift heavy ions in Gd2Ti2O7 and Y2Ti2O7 pyrochlores	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Ion irradiation; Pyrochlores; X-ray diffraction; Raman spectroscopy	THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; RADIATION TOLERANCE; WASTE FORM; OXIDES; AMORPHIZATION; IRRADIATION; IMMOBILIZATION; PLUTONIUM; TRACKS	The structural transformations induced by ionization processes in Gd2Ti2O7 and Y2Ti2O7 pyrochlores irradiated with swift heavy ions have been studied using XRD and Raman experiments. Results show that irradiation induces amorphization and that the phase transformation build-up can be accounted for in the framework of a model involving a single-impact mechanism. The radiation induced amorphization build-up is faster in Gd2Ti2O7 than in Y2Ti2O7. Moreover, a decrease of the thermal conductivity (measured by the laser flash method) is induced by irradiation both in Gd2Ti2O7 and Y2Ti2O7. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Activation of accelerator construction materials by heavy ions	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Residual activity; Heavy-ion fragmentation; Gamma-ray spectroscopy; FLUKA code	URANIUM IONS; COPPER; STEEL	Activation data for an aluminum target irradiated by 200 MeV/u U-238 ion beam are presented in the paper. The target was irradiated in the stacked-foil geometry and analyzed using gamma-ray spectroscopy. The purpose of the experiment was to study the role of primary particles, projectile fragments, and target fragments in the activation process using the depth profiling of residual activity. The study brought information on which particles contribute dominantly to the target activation. The experimental data were compared with the Monte Carlo simulations by the FLORA 2011.2c.0 code. This study is a part of a research program devoted to activation of accelerator construction materials by high-energy (>= 200 MeV/u) heavy ions at GSI Darmstadt. The experimental data are needed to validate the computer codes used for simulation of interaction of swift heavy ions with matter. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Response from inorganic scintillation screens induced by high energetic ions	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Scintillation screens; Inorganic material; High energetic beam; Light output; Emission spectra	NON-PROPORTIONALITY; LUMINESCENCE; NONPROPORTIONALITY; DETECTORS	Inorganic scintillation screens were irradiated with swift heavy ion beams at GSI accelator facility, using protons up to Uranium ions as projectiles. Beams were extracted from the synchrotron SIS18 with high energy (approximate to 300 MeV/u) in slow and fast extraction mode. During irradiation the scintillation response of the screens was recorded by two different optical setups simultaneously to investigate the light output, profile characteristics and emission spectra. In principle fast extracted beams induce lower light output than slow extracted beams. The output per deposited energy shows a decreasing dependency with respect of the atomic number. Emission spectra showed no significant defects of the materials, neither at irradiation with increasing beam intensity nor during long time irradiation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is therefore crucial to understand the hydration behavior of smectite in terms of swelling during hydration and saturation processes.Against such a background, the authors simultaneously observed behaviors of smectite swelling at the micro-level (i.e., both the generation of swelling pressure and the change of hydration state). In the experiments, deionized water was allowed to permeate into a dried specimen of smectite (named Kunipia-F (R)) with different dry densities ((d): 0.97, 1.23, 1.43, 1.64 and 1.88 Mg/m(3)) under conditions of constant temperature and volume. The swelling pressure was measured using an insitu uniaxial consolidation apparatus during the water feeding process. Changes in local hydration states (i.e., one-molecular-layer hydration states to three-molecular-layer hydration states) were also simultaneously observed. Hydration among these different states propagated from the inlet side to the outlet side of the specimen. The authors discussed the relationships governing the hydration state, swelling pressure, the number of hydration moles, dry density, equilibrium final pressure, and then the dynamic mechanism behind pressure propagation.

The highest activity level of 2736 mu Bq L-1 reported in Lugbe borehole, whereas the lowest value of 443 mu Bq L-1 reported at Gosa borehole. The inhabitants permanently used water from the boreholes for daily consumption. The group receives 5.55 x 10(-5) mSv of the annual collective effective dose due to U-238 in drinking water. The radiological risks of U-238 in the water samples were found to be low, typically in magnitude of 10(-7) with cancer mortality value of 1.03 x 10(-7) and morbidity value of 1.57 x 10(-7). The chemical toxicity risk of U-238 in drinking water over a lifetime consumption has a mean value of 4.0 x 10(-3) g kg(-1) day(-1). It could be that the human risk due to U-238 content in groundwater supplies from ingestion may likely be the chemical toxicity of U-238 as a heavy metal rather than radiological risk. Significantly, Lugbe subsurface may have developed some fractions of granitic strata that contributed to the distribution of radioactive of U-238 in tectonically weak zones.

J	Wang, SB; He, CH				Wang, Sanbing; He, Chaohui			Subcritical space nuclear system without most movable control systems	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						space nuclear reactor; RTG; SAFE400; MCNPX	ACCELERATOR-DRIVEN SYSTEMS; REACTOR; FUEL	This paper describes the design and analysis of advanced space nuclear reactor (ASNR) whose design combines the advantages of radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) and space nuclear reactor (SNR). As opposed to current SNRs designs, ASNR is a subcritical system driven by U-232-Be neutron source to generate thermal power continuously. Most movable control systems in the SNR design are removed. The detailed neutronic calculations by MCNPX (Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtended), including k(eff), flux, burn-up, loss-ratio of neutron source and immersion reactivity, show that ASNR has higher criticality safety and more compact structure to bear the risk of immersion accident compared with the past SNRs, and the new system can provide more thermal power than RTG. Furthermore, the neutron source efficiency is optimized to improve the utilization of U-232-Be neutron source with the improvement of criticality safety. Compared with the past designs of space nuclear power, ASNR could provide enough thermal power and avoid the occurrence of serious immersion accident in the case of total control system failure. ASNR has potential for future deep space missions.

J	Bae, G; Hong, SG				Bae, Gonghoon; Hong, Ser Gi			A small long-cycle PWR core design concept using fully ceramic micro-encapsulated (FCM) and UO2-ThO2 fuels for burning of TRU	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						TRU burning; small long-cycle PWR; FCM particle fuel	FAST-REACTOR CORES; PHYSICS	In this paper, a new small pressurized water reactor (PWR) core design concept using fully ceramic micro-encapsulated (FCM) particle fuels and UO2-ThO2 fuels was studied for effective burning of transuranics from a view point of core neutronics. The core of this concept rate is 100 MWe. The core designs use the current PWR-proven technologies except for a mixed use of the FCM and UO2-ThO2 fuel pins of low-enriched uranium. The significant burning of TRU is achieved with tri-isotropic particle fuels of FCM fuel pins, and the ThO2-UO2 fuel pins are employed to achieve long-cycle length of approximate to 4 EFPYs (effective full-power year). Also, the effects of several candidate materials for reflector are analyzed in terms of core neutronics because the small core size leads to high sensitivity of reflector material on the cycle length. The final cores having 10 w/o SS303 and 90 w/o graphite reflector are shown to have high TRU burning rates of 33%-35% in FCM pins and significant net burning rates of 24%-25% in the total core with negative reactivity coefficients, low power peaking factors, and sufficient shutdown margins of control rods.

In the experiment, n-butyraldehyde was utilized as a reducing reagent of (NpO22+)-O-(VI) to (NpO2+)-O-(V) for the purpose to distinguish (NpO22+)-O-(VI) from Np4+. From the Np concentration in the aqueous phase, Np would be extracted from the dissolver solution together with U and Pu. The scrutiny of Np behavior was performed utilizing 66 cases of calculation results by a Japan Atomic Energy Agency open extraction simulation code, the Program for Advanced Extraction with Radiation Effect Calculation-Lightened version. From the scrutiny, the authors found that the calculation result with 60% of Np4+ in the dissolver solution represented the best experimental extraction-separation behavior of Np. Therefore, it was supposed that the dissolver solution contained sufficient proportion of Np4+ to affect the extraction-separation behavior of Np.

The BGO (Bismuth Germanate Oxide) Calorimeter, which consists of 616 PMTs (photomultiplier tubes) and 1848 dynode signals, is a crucial part of the DAMPE payload for measuring the energy of cosmic ray particles, distinguishing interesting particles from background, and providing trigger information. An electronics system, which consists of 16 FEE (Front End Electronics) modules with a total power consumption of about 26 W, has been developed. Its main functions are based on the low power, 32-channel VA160 and VATA160 ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) for precisely measuring the charge of PMT signals and providing"hit" signals as well. To assure the long-term reliability in harsh space environment, a series of critical issues such as the radiation hardness, thermal design, components and board level quality control, etc., are taken into consideration. Test result showed that the system level ENC (equivalent noise charge) for each channel is about 10 fC in RMS (root mean square), and the timing uncertainty of the hit signals is about 300 ns, both of which satisfy the physics requirements of the detector. Experiments with Co-60 radioactive source proved that 20 krad(Si) TID (Total Ionizing Dose) level is achieved, while the heavy ion beam and laser beam tests indicated that its SEL (Single Event Latch-up) and SEU (Single Event Upset) performance in orbit will be acceptable by taking some hardness measures. All the readout modules successfully passed the board-level screening, the sub-system level and finally the satellite system level environmental tests, and behave well in the beam test at CERN (European Organisation for Nuclear Research).

As this turns out to be a highly nonconcave maximization, convergence rates of global convergent algorithms, such as simulated annealing, can be very slow and iterative algorithms such an Newton's method for maximization can be captured by local maxima while fast. Thus, the selection of the initial estimate is critical to how well they perform. This paper proposes a way to generate such an initial estimate using an averaging process that is shown to be asymptotically convergent to the maximum likelihood source estimate. This ensures that with a sufficiently large number of samples, the initial estimate is indeed within of the basin of attraction of such iterative algorithms. Analytical results are supported by numerical simulations based on a measured background data and synthetically injected source data.

In this paper, some representational criticality safety and shielding assessments are presented for a particular PHWR plutonium-thorium based fuel bundle concept in a hypothetical aboveground dry storage module. The criticality assessment found that the important parameters for the storage design are neutron absorber content and fuel composition, particularly in light of the high sensitivity of code results to plutonium. The shielding assessment showed that the shielding as presented in the paper would need to be redesigned to provide greater gamma attenuation. These findings can be used to aid in designing fuel storage facilities.

In the Canadian Standards Association's radioactive waste classification system, there are 2 sub-classes within low-level radioactive waste: very short-lived radioactive waste and very low-level radioactive waste (VLLW). VLLW has a low hazard potential but is above the Canadian unconditional clearance criteria as set out in Schedule 2 of Nuclear Substances and Devices Regulations. Long-term waste management facilities for VLLW do not require a high degree of containment and isolation. In general, a relatively low-cost near-surface facility with limited regulatory control is suitable for VLLW. At Canadian Nuclear Laboratories' Chalk River Laboratories site an initiative, VLLW Sequestration, was implemented in 2013 to set aside potential VLLW for temporary storage and to be later dispositioned in the planned VLLW facility. As of May 2015, a total of 236m(3) resulting in approximately $1.1 million in total savings have been sequestered. One of the main hurdles in implementing VLLW Sequestration is the development of process criteria. Waste Acceptance Criteria (WAC) are used as a guide or as requirements for determining whether waste is accepted by the waste management facility. Establishment of the process criteria ensures that segregated waste materials have a high likelihood to meet the VLLW WAC and be accepted into the planned VLLW facility. This paper outlines the challenges and various factors which were considered in the development of interim process criteria.

Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), particularly the compact ETH Zurich system "Tandy", has evolved over the years as one of the most sensitive, selective, and robust techniques for actinide analysis. Employment of the AMS technique can reduce the demands on sample preparation chemistry and increase sample analysis throughput, due to very low instrumental detection limit, high rejection of interferences, and low susceptibility to adverse sample matrices. Initial research and development tests were performed to explore and demonstrate the analytical capability of AMS for Pu and Np urine bioassay. In this study, urine samples spiked with femtogram levels of Np and Pu isotopes were prepared and measured using compact ETH AMS system and the results showed excellent analytical capability for measuring Np and Pu isotopes at femtogram/litre levels in urine.

Extracting the uranium would be advantageous for decreasing the waste classification and reducing the cost of long-term management. The chemical leachability of 3 key elements (U, Hg, and Cs) from a surrogate cemented waste (SCW) was studied with several lixiviants. The results showed that the most promising approach to leach and recover U, Hg, and Cs is the direct leaching of the SCW with H2SO4 in strong saline media. Operating parameters such as particle size, temperature, pulp density, leaching time, acid and salt concentrations, number of leaching/washing steps, etc. were optimized to improve key elements solubilization. Sulfuric leaching in saline media of a SCW (U5) containing 1182 ppm of U, 1598 ppm of Hg, and 7.9 ppm of Cs in the optimized conditions allows key elements solubilisation of 98.5 +/- 0.4%, 96.6 +/- 0.1%, and 93.8 +/- 1.1% of U, Hg, and Cs, respectively. This solubilization process was then applied in triplicate to 7 other SCWs prepared with different cements, liquid ratios, and at different aging times and temperatures. Concentrated sulfuric acid is added to the slurry until the pH is about 2, which causes the complete degradation of cement and the formation of CaSO4. Sulfuric acid is particularly useful because it produces a leachate that is amenable to conventional ion exchange technology for the separation and recovery of uranium.

Together, these present a significant risk on how to handle the package for destructive examination of its contents. Whether of nefarious origin or the result of less stringent practices of yesteryear the material needs to be properly identified and characterized for appropriate disposition. Results of neutron imaging, neutron diffraction, and delayed neutron analysis as applied to an examination of sealed capsules containing unknown radioactive materials are presented. The results demonstrate that neutron-based non-destructive examination techniques can be employed for inspecting encapsulated radioactive samples to identify the materials, to elucidate the internal physical structure of the radioactive material and encapsulation, and to estimate the mass of fissile and fissionable materials within. This characterization of orphaned radioactive special nuclear material illustrates the potential for these techniques in nuclear forensics investigations.

A NUMERICAL SIMULATION METHOD FOR CALCULATION OF LINEAR ATTENUATION COEFFICIENTS OF UNIDENTIFIED SAMPLE MATERIALS IN ROUTINE GAMMA RAY SPECTROMETRY	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY & RADIATION PROTECTION			English	Article						gamma ray spectrometry; linear attenuation coefficient; effective solid angle; path length; numerical simulation method	ENVIRONMENTAL-SAMPLES; SCINTILLATION DETECTORS; COINCIDENCE CORRECTIONS; SELF-ABSORPTION; EFFICIENCY	When using gamma ray spectrometry for radioactivity analysis of environmental samples (such as soil, sediment or ash of a living organism), relevant linear attenuation coefficients should be known - in order to calculate self-absorption in the sample bulk. This parameter is additionally important since the unidentified samples are normally different in composition and density from the reference ones (the latter being e.g. liquid sources, commonly used for detection efficiency calibration in radioactivity monitoring). This work aims at introducing a numerical simulation method for calculation of linear attenuation coefficients without the use of a collimator. The method is primarily based on calculations of the effective solid angles - compound parameters accounting for the emission and detection probabilities, as well as for the source-to-detector geometrical configuration. The efficiency transfer principle and average path lengths through the samples themselves are employed, too. The results obtained are compared with those from the NIST-XCOM data base; close agreement confirms the validity of the numerical simulation method approach.

A cascade impactor sampler was used to determine the size-activity distributions of radioactive aerosols in each of the sampling stations. Levels of alpha and beta activities were determined based on a counting method using a liquid scintillation counter and smear tests. The total average mass fractions of fine particles (particle diameter dp < 1 mu m) in all of the sampling stations were approximately 26.75 %, with the mean and standard deviation of 52.15 +/- 19.75 mu g/m(3). The total average mass fractions of coarse particles were approximately 73.2%, with the mean and standard deviation of 71.34 +/- 24.57 mu g/m(3). In addition to natural radionuclides, artificial radionuclides, such as Na-24, Sr-91, I-131, I-133, Ru-103, B-82, and La-140, may be released into the reactor containment structure. Maximum activity was associated with accumulation-mode particles with diameters less than 400 nm. The results obtained from liquid scintillation counting suggested that the mean specific activity of alpha particles in fine and coarse-modes were 89.7 % and 10.26 %, respectively. The mean specific activity of beta particles in fine and coarse-modes were 81.15 % and 18.51 %, respectively. A large fraction of the radionuclides' mass concentration in the Tehran research reactor containment was associated with coarse-mode particles, in addition, a large fraction of the activity in the aerosol particles was associated with accumulation-mode particles.

THE DOSE FROM RADIOACTIVITY OF COVERING CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS IN SERBIA	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY & RADIATION PROTECTION			English	Article						dose; activity concentration; natural radionuclide; covering material	INDIAN BUILDING-MATERIALS; NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; EXTERNAL EXPOSURE; RADIONUCLIDES; DWELLINGS; GRANITES; TH-232; RATES; U-238; K-40	The indoor dose due to the radiation of ceramic and granite tiles, marble, granite and travertine plates, as well as some components of covering materials, produced in Serbia or imported from other countries, was estimated in the work. Activity concentrations of Ra-226, Th-232, and K-40 were measured by the standard gamma-spectrometry system. The lowest content of the radionuclides was found in white marble (A(Ra) = 2 Bq/kg,A(Th) < 2 Bq/kg, and A(K) < 3 Bq/kg), while the highest activities were in some granite samples (Balmoral red:A(Ra) = 200 Bq/kg, An, = 378 Bq/kg, and A(K) = 1679, and Madura Gold: A(Ra) = 273 Bq/kg, A(Th) = 20 Bq/kg, and A(K) = 1456 Bq/kg). The indoor absorbed dose rate in air due to the gamma radiation from covering materials was determined based on the specific absorbed dose rate computed in this work. Concentration of Rn-222 that emanated into the indoor space was also calculated from the known Ra-226 content. The radiation hazard estimated from the usage of each sample was expressed through the evaluated effective dose. Almost all samples, except one, fulfil the dosimetric criterion for safe use.

The alpha emitting nature of these gases made it possible to detect in indoor environment with the help of nuclear track detector techniques. The soil is the main source of indoor radon as it contains varying amounts of uranium and thorium. Thus the exhalation of radon from soil and its environmental activity needs to be studied. In the present study, the measurement of the indoor radon-thoron from the indoor environment and exhalation from soil are carried out using solid state nuclear track detector technique from Sirsa and Bhiwani districts of northern part of India. The canister technique was used to measure the radon exhalation rate from the soil samples collected from the study area and pinhole based radon-thoron dosimeters were used to measure indoor radon and thoron concentration. The results show that indoor radon concentration varied from 9 to 28 Bq/m(3), with an average of 18.9 Bq/m(3) and from 5 to 21 Bq/m(3), with an average of 13.8 Bq/m(3), for Bhiwani and Sirsa, respectively. Similarly, thoron concentration varied from 14 to 48 Bq/m(3), with average of 28.9 Bq/m(3) and 27 to 54 Bq/m(3), with the average of 39.0 Bq/m(3), for Bhiwani and Sirsa, respectively. The mass exhalation rates from soil samples were also measured, to estimate their contribution to indoor radon. A correlation study was carried out between soil exhalation rates and indoor radon concentration.

The contaminated water at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plants has been purified by the water treatment system, called Advanced Liquid Processing System, co-developed by Japanese and international technologies. The system is used to remove most remaining radioactive contaminants in water that had to be stored at the facility. In this paper, a snake-like robot, incorporated with Advanced Liquid Processing System is introduced for the severe accident in the nuclear power plants in which human cannot control the cleaning-up in the sea where the radioactive materials have been submerged and some resolved in the sea water. The effective strategy of the cleaning-up is analyzed from the environmental protection aspect with the snake's biomechanics and radioactive hazards.

Developing detection equipment to meet this objective requires accurate simulation of both the detectable signature and detection mechanism. A delayed particle capability was initially added to MCNPX 2.6. A in 2005 to sample the radioactive fission product parents and emit decay particles resulting from the decay chain. To meet the objectives of detection scenario modeling, the capability was designed to sample a particular time for emitting particular multiplicity of a particular energy. Because the sampling process of selecting both time and energy is interdependent, to linearize the time and emission sampling, atom densities are computed at several discrete time steps, and the time-integrated production is computed by multiplying the atom density by the decay constant and time step size to produce a cumulative distribution function for sampling the emission time, energy, and multiplicity. The delayed particle capability was initially given a time-bin structure to help reasonably reproduce, from a qualitative sense, a fission benchmark by Beddingfield, which examined the delayed gamma emission. This original benchmark was only qualitative and did not contain the magnitudes of the actual measured data but did contain relative graphical representation of the spectra. A better benchmark with measured data was later provided by Hunt, Mozin, Reedy, Selpel, and Tobin at the Idaho Accelerator Center; however, because of the complexity of the benchmark setup, sizable systematic errors were expected in the modeling, and initial results compared to MCNPX 2.7.0 showed errors outside of statistical fluctuation. Presented here is a more simplified approach to benchmarking, utilizing closed form analytic solutions to the granddaughter equations for particular sets of decay systems. We examine five different decay chains ( two-stage decay to stable) and show the predictability of the MCNP6 delayed gamma feature. Results do show that while the default delayed gamma calculations available in the MCNP6 1.0 release can give accurate results for some isotopes ( e.g., Ba-137), the percent differences between the closed form analytic solutions and the MCNP6 calculations were often >40% (Mg-28, Al-28, K-42, Ca-47, Sc-47, Co-60). With the MCNP6 1.1 Beta release, the tenth entry on the DBCN card allows improved calculation within <5% as compared to the closed form analytic solutions for immediate parent emissions and transient equilibrium systems. While the tenth entry on the DBCN card for MCNP6 1.1 gives much better results for transient equilibrium systems and parent emissions in general, it does little to improve daughter emissions of secular equilibrium systems. Hypotheses were presented as to why daughter emissions of secular equilibrium systems might be mispredicted in some cases and not in others.	[Weldon, R. A., Jr.; Fensin, M. L.; McKinney, G.

With all five reactors being already beyond their 30th year of operation, Nagra (National Cooperative for the Disposal of Radioactive Waste) in collaboration with the utilities periodically contributes to the Swiss Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) decommissioning cost studies. These studies are of relevance to the estimation of the financial input of the utilities to the Swiss decommissioning fund and the planning of decommissioning activities. During reactor operation, a fraction of the neutrons produced in the reactor core will escape the core boundaries and eventually interact with the surrounding matter. The most heavily irradiated components are located in the proximity of the reactor core [e.g., core baffle, core support plates, core barrel, and reactor pressure vessel (RPV)]. Neutrons will also stream in farther ex-RPV areas and activate components such as the reinforced concrete bioshield. Decommissioning costs are dependent, inter alia, on the radioactive waste volumes and on the corresponding isotopic inventories. Neutron-activated components are the main source of radioactivity within a NPP under immediate dismantling (i.e., spent fuel has been removed from the reactor). Reliable neutron transport and activation calculations are, therefore, essential for the estimation of radioactive waste volumes, the selection of an optimal dismantling strategy, the development of the radioactive waste packaging and logistics concept, and consequently for the estimation of the decommissioning costs. In this context, Nagra has developed a state-of-the-art NPP activation calculation sequence that enables the radiological characterization of the Swiss NPPs. This paper focuses on aspects relevant to the neutron transport calculations for a Swiss pressurized water reactor. More specifically, the MCNP5 modeling approach together with the use of the ADVANTG hybrid, variance-reduction acceleration code, is outlined. Furthermore, the validation of the neutron transport calculations with an in situ full-cycle foil activation campaign is presented.

In some applications, accurate full-scale Monte Carlo (MC) SDDR simulations are needed for very large systems with massive amounts of shielding materials. However, these simulations are impractical because calculation of space-and energy-dependent neutron fluxes throughout the structural materials is needed to estimate distribution of radioisotopes causing the SDDR. Biasing the neutron MC calculation using an importance function is not simple because it is difficult to explicitly express the response function, which depends on subsequent computational steps. Typical SDDR calculations do not consider how uncertainties in MC neutron calculation impact SDDR uncertainty, even though MC neutron calculation uncertainties usually dominate SDDR uncertainty. The Multi-Step Consistent Adjoint Driven Importance Sampling (MS-CADIS) hybrid MC/deterministic method was developed to speed SDDR MC neutron transport calculation using a deterministically calculated importance function representing the neutron importance to the final SDDR. Undersampling is usually inevitable in large-problem SDDR simulations because it is very difficult for the MC method to simulate particles in all space and energy elements of the neutron calculation. MS-CADIS can assess the degree of undersampling in SDDR calculations by determining the fraction of the SDDR response in the space and energy elements that did not have any scores in the MC neutron calculation. It can also provide estimates for upper and lower limits of SDDR statistical uncertainties resulting from uncertainties in MC neutron calculation. MS-CADIS was applied to the ITER SDDR benchmark problem that resembles the configuration and geometrical arrangement of an upper port plug in ITER. Without using the hybrid MC/deterministic methods to speed MC neutron calculations, SDDR calculations were significantly undersampled for all tallies, even when MC neutron calculation computational time was 32 CPU-days. However, all SDDR tally results with MC neutron calculations of only 2 CPU-days converged with the standard Forward-Weighted CADIS (FW-CADIS) method and the MS-CADIS method. Compared to the standard FW-CADIS approach, MS-CADIS decreased the undersampling in the calculated SDDR by factors between 0.9% and 0.3% for computational times between 4 and 32 CPU-days, and it increased the computational efficiency of the SDDR neutron MC calculation by factors between 43% and 69%.

Batch experiments were carried out to investigate adsorption behavior of thorium in nitric acid solutions. Adsorption at different concentrations of nitric acid and thorium, influence of contact time and coexisting metal ions, and effect of NO3- were investigated in detail. It was found that at high HNO3 concentrations, the resins exhibited higher adsorption capacity and better affinity towards thorium. The adsorption kinetics could be described by the pseudo-second order model equation, while the adsorption isotherms were well correlated by the Langmuir model. The maximum capacity towards thorium species on SiPyR-N4 was evaluated at 27-28 mg/g-resin. The thermodynamic parameters indicated the adsorption was an exothermic reaction. The presence of NO3- was found to promote the retention of the thorium species.

In addition, accurate predictions of induced radioactivity are essential to the design, operation, and decommissioning of a high-energy electron linear accelerator. In the case of the 200-MeV electron linac of the National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (NSRL), the electrons are accelerated by five acceleration tubes and collimated by copper scrapers. The scrapers, which play a vital role in protecting the acceleration cavity, are bombarded by many electrons over a long-term operation, which causes a significant amount of induced radioactivity. Recently, the NSRL Linac is the first high-energy electron linear accelerator in China to be out of commission. Its decommissioning is highly significant for obtaining decommissioning experience. This paper focuses on the measurement of induced radioactivity on the fourth scraper, where the electron energy was 158 MeV. The radionuclides were classified according to their half-lives. Such a classification provides a reliable basis for the formulation of radiation protection and facility decommissioning. To determine the high-radioactivity area and to facilitate the decommissioning process, the slicing method was applied in this study. The specific activity of Co-60 in each slice was measured at a cooling time of ten months, and the results were compared with the predictions generated by Monte Carlo program FLUKA. The trend of the measured results is in good agreement with the normalized simulation results. The slicing simulation using Monte Carlo method is useful for the determination of high-radiation areas and proper material handling protocols and, therefore, lays a foundation for the accumulation of decommissioning experience.

Thorium biosorption depended on the pH of environment, and its rapid biosorption reached a maximum of up to 10.75 mg Th per gram of the bacteria (wet wt.) at pH 3.0. The biosorption agreed bettter with Langmuir isotherm model than Freundlich model, indicating that thorium biosorption was a monolayer adsorption. The thermodynamic parameters, negative change in Gibbs free energy and positive value in enthalpy and entropy, suggested that the biosorption was spontaneous, more favorable at higher temperature and endothermic process with an increase of entropy. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that thorium initially binded with the cell surface, while transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that Th deposited in the cytoplasm and served as cores for growth of element precipitation (e.g., phosphate minerals) or by self-precipitation of hydroxides, which is probably controlled by ion-exchange, as evidenced by particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE) and enhanced proton backscattering spectrometry (EPBS). Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) further indicated that thorium biosorption involved carboxyl and phosphate groups and protein in complexation or electrostatic interaction. Overall results indicated that a combined electrostatic interaction-complexation-ion exchange mechanism could be involved in thorium biosorption by Bacillus sp. dwc-2.

Several radioisotopes are used in radiolabeling of BLMs for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. An important points in developing new radiopharmaceuticals, especially therapeutic agents, is the absorbed dose delivered in critical organs. In this work, absorbed dose to organs after injection of Sm-153-, Lu-177- and Ho-166-labeled BLM was investigated by radiation dose assessment resource (RADAR) method based on biodistribution data in wild-type rats. The absorbed dose effect of the radionuclides was evaluated. The maximum absorbed dose for the complexes was observed in the kidneys, liver and lungs. For all the radiolabeled BLMs, bone and red marrow received considerable absorbed dose. Due to the high energy beta particles emitted by Ho-166, higher absorbed dose is observed for Ho-166-BLM in the most organs. The reported data can be useful for the determination of the maximum permissible injected activity of the radiolabeled BLMs in the treatment planning programs.

Depletion of Gadolinium burnable poison in a PWR assembly with high burnup fuel	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article								A tendency to increase the discharge burnup of nuclear fuel for Advanced Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR) has been a characteristic of its operation for many years. It will be able to burn at very high burnup of about 70 GWd/t with UO2 fuels. The U-235 enrichment must be higher than 5 %, which leads to the necessity of using an extremely efficient burnable poison like Gadolinium oxide. Using gadolinium isotope is significant due to its particular depletion behavior ("Onion-Skin" effect). In this paper, the MCNPX2.7 code is used to calculate the important neutronic parameters of the next generation fuels of PWR. K-infinity, local peaking factor and fission rate distributions are calculated for a PWR assembly which burn at very high burnup reaching 70 GWd/t. The calculations are performed using the recently released evaluated Gadolinium cross section data. The results obtained are close to those of a LWR next generation fuel benchmark problem. This demonstrates that the calculation scheme used is able to accurately model a PWR assembly that operates at high burnup values.	[Refeat, R.

Radiotracer application for characterization of nuclear grade anion exchange resins Tulsion A-23 and Dowex SBR LC	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article							RADIOACTIVE-TRACER TECHNIQUE; DISTRIBUTION COEFFICIENT; ION; DEPENDENCE; IP	Radio isotopic tracer technique as one of the versatile nondestructive technique is employed to evaluate the performance of nuclear grade anion exchange resins Tulsion A-23 and Dowex SBR LC. The evaluation was made on the basis of ion-isotopic exchange reaction kinetics by using I-131 and Br-82 radioactive tracer isotopes. It was observed that for both the resins, the values of specific reaction rate (min(-1)), amount of ion exchanged (mmol) and initial rate of ion exchange (mmol/min) were calculated to be lower for bromide ion-isotopic exchange reaction than that for iodide ion-isotopic exchange reaction. It was observed that for iodide ion-isotopic exchange reaction under identical experimental conditions of 30.0 degrees C, 1.000 g of ion exchange resins and 0.001 mol/L labeled iodide ion solution, the values of specific reaction rate (min(-1)), amount of iodide ion exchanged (mmol), initial rate of iodide ion exchange (mmol/min) and log K-d were calculated as 0.377, 0.212, 0.080 and 15.5 respectively for Dowex SBR LC resin, which was higher than 0.215, 0.144, 0.031 and 14.1 respectively as that obtained for Tulsion A23 resins. Also at a constant temperature of 30.0 degrees C, as the concentration of labeled iodide ion solution increases from 0.001 mol/L to 0.004 mol/L, the percentage of iodide ions exchanged increases from 84.75% to 90.20% for Dowex SBR LC resins which was higher than increases from 57.66 % to 62.38% obtained for Tulsion A23 resins. The identical trend was observed for the two resins during bromide ionisotopic exchange reaction. The overall results indicate superior performance of Dowex SBR LC over Tulsion A23 resins under identical experimental conditions.	[Singare, P.

A follow-up cytogenetic study of workers highly exposed inside the Chernobyl sarcophagus	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							INDUCED CHROMOSOME-ABERRATIONS; HUMAN-LYMPHOCYTES; RADIATION; DOSIMETRY; HYBRIDIZATION; FISH	Data are presented on some of the engineers and scientists who regularly entered highly radioactive areas of the sarcophagus chamber constructed around the ruins of the Chernobyl reactor. Previous investigations on six of them by unstable chromosomal aberrations, quartz fibre electrometers and, in some cases, tooth electron spin resonance have all indicated high doses accumulated over several years of work inside the sarcophagus. Here, the authors present the data on eleven of the men who agreed to be monitored cytogenetically although two have since died aged 45 and 66 y. The present data were combined with the previous to examine the time-courses of these individuals' changes in their aberration frequencies. As expected, dicentric aberrations showed a clear drop down to 2-3 per 100 cells since the men ceased working inside the sarcophagus. In contrast, the translocation yields remained at a high level showing no tendency to decrease and so proved reliable for retrospective biodosimetry. These data are particularly useful in demonstrating the value of FISH long after high but protracted and fractionated exposure.	[Khvostunov, I.

J	Das, A; Duttagupta, SP				Das, Achintya; Duttagupta, Siddhartha P.			TCAD simulation for alpha-particle spectroscopy using SIC Schottky diode	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; AUGER RECOMBINATION; DETECTORS; RADON; SILICON; SEMICONDUCTOR; PRODUCTS; MOBILITY; DESIGN; MODEL	There is a growing requirement of alpha spectroscopy in the fields context of environmental radioactive contamination, nuclear waste management, site decommissioning and decontamination. Although silicon-based alpha-particle detection technology is mature, high leakage current, low displacement threshold and radiation hardness limits the operation of the detector in harsh environments. Silicon carbide (SiC) is considered to be excellent material for radiation detection application due to its high band gap, high displacement threshold and high thermal conductivity. In this report, an alpha-particle-induced electron-hole pair generation model for a reverse-biased n-type SiC Schottky diode has been proposed and verified using technology computer aided design (TCAD) simulations. First, the forward-biased I-V characteristics were studied to determine the diode ideality factor and compared with published experimental data. The ideality factor was found to be in the range of 1.4-1.7 for a corresponding temperature range of 300-500 K. Next, the energy-dependent, alpha-particle-induced EHP generation model parameters were optimised using transport of ions in matter (TRIM) simulation. Finally, the transient pulses generated due to alpha-particle bombardment were analysed for (1) different diode temperatures (300-500 K), (2) different incident alpha-particle energies (1-5 MeV), (3) different reverse bias voltages of the 4H-SiC-based Schottky diode (-50 to -250 V) and (4) different angles of incidence of the alpha particle (0A degrees aEuro"70A degrees).The above model can be extended to other (wide band-gap semiconductor) device technologies useful for radiation-sensing application.
