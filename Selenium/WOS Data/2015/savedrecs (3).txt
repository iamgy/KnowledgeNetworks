A method for establishing absolute full-energy peak efficiency and its confidence interval for HPGe detectors	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						HPGe detector; Absolute efficiency calibrations; Confidence interval; Linearized least squares fitting	CALIBRATION; RANGE	A method is proposed for establishing the absolute efficiency calibration old HPGe detector including the confidence interval in the energy range of 79.6-3451.2 keV. The calibrations were accomplished with the Ba-133, Co-66, Co-56 and Eu-152 point-like radioactive sources with only the Co-66 source being activity calibrated to an accuracy of 2% at the 90% confidence level. All data sets measured from activity calibrated and uncalibrated sources were fit simultaneously using the linearized least squares method. The proposed fit function accounts for scaling of the data taken with activity uncalibrated sources to the data taken with the high accuracy activity calibrated source. The confidence interval for the fit was found analytically using the covariance matrix. Accuracy of the fit was below 3.5% at the 90% confidence level in the 79.6-3451.2 key energy range.

F-18 Half-life measurement using 2-gamma coincidence method	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Coincidence measurement; Dead time correction; HPGe detector; F-18	PILE-UP CORRECTIONS; DEAD-TIME; STANDARDIZATION; SPECTROMETRY; REJECTION	The accuracy of the half-life measurement of short-lived radioisotopes such as positron-emitting F-18 (tau(1/2) approximate to 100 min) is limited mainly by inaccuracies in the detector counting statistics. Gamma-ray measurement with a high-activity F-18 source requires counting-loss corrections to compensate for random summing effects and the detector's dead time. In this study, we measure the half-life of F-18 with two 511-keV gamma-rays using two high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors. The counting-loss corrections are performed via two approaches to address the problems of random coincidence summing and dead time: a half-life measurement with a Na-22 source and a Geant4 simulation of the detector response. Variations in the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of the 511-keV peak are found to show good correlation with the random summing effect. The half-life of F-18 is estimated as 109.73 +/- 0.14 min.

In this project, a 100 MeV high intensity compact proton cyclotron is built for multiple applications. The first successful beam extraction of CYCIAE-100 cyclotron was done in the middle of 2014. The extracted proton beam energy is 100 MeV and the beam current is more than 20 mu A. The RF system of the CYCIAE-100 cyclotron includes two half-wavelength cavities, two 100 kW tetrode amplifiers and power transmission line systems (all above are independent from each other) and two sets of Low Level RF control crates. Each set of LLRF control includes an amplitude control unit, a tuning control unit, a phase control unit, a local Digital Signal Process control unit and an Advanced RISC Machines based EPICS IOC unit. These two identical LLRF control crates share one common reference clock and take advantages of modem digital technologies (e.g. DSP and Direct Digital Synthesizer) to achieve closed loop voltage and phase regulations of the dee-voltage. In the beam commission, the measured dee-voltage stability of RF system is better than 0.1% and phase stability is better than 0.03 degrees. The hardware design of the LLRF system will be reviewed in this paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

PIXE characterization of by-products resulting from the zinc recycling of industrial cemented carbides	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						PIXE; Tungsten carbide; Powder metallurgy; Zinc recycling	PROTON MICROPROBE; TUNGSTEN CARBIDE	By-product materials of the widely used zinc recycling process of cemented carbides have been studied. Scanning electron microscopy and micro-PIXE techniques have identified elemental concentrations, distributions and purity of by-product materials from an industrial zinc recycling plant. Cobalt surface enrichment, lamellar microstructures of varying composition, including alternating tungsten carbide (WC) grains and globular cobalt, and regions of excess zinc contamination were found in materials with incomplete zinc penetration. Liquid Co-Zn formation occurred above 72 wt.% Zn at the furnace temperature of 930 degrees C, and was extracted towards the surface of poorly zinc infiltrated material, primarily by the vacuum used for zinc distillation. Surface enrichment was not observed in material that was zinc infiltrated to the sample center, which was more friable and exhibited more homogeneous porosity and elemental concentrations. The result of incomplete zinc infiltration was an enriched surface zone of up to 60 wt.% Co, compared to an original sample composition of similar to 10-15 wt.% Co. The impact on resulting powders could be higher or inhomogeneous cobalt content, as well as unacceptably high zinc concentrations. PIXE has proven it can be a powerful technique for solving industrial problems in the cemented carbide cutting tool industry, by identifying trace elements and their locations (such as Zn to 0.1 wt.% accuracy), as well as the distribution of major elements within WC-Co materials.

Zeolite, calcium hydroxide and MR-1 type emulsifier were mixed into the cement blends for improving the performance of solidified waste forms (SWF). The properties of SWF were evaluated in terms of mechanical strength, leachability and mineral phase analyses. The hydration products of SWF were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The experimental results showed that the 28 d compressive strengths of SAC solidified waste forms (SACF) and PC solidified waste forms (PCF) were 14.23 and 19.07 MPa, respectively. Leaching sequence of three radionuclides in two kinds of SWF is Cs+ > Sr2+ > Co2+. Compared with PCF, SACF had better performance in preventing nuclides Co2+ and Cs+ from leaching to the environment. The XRD patterns suggested that simulated spent radioactive organic solvent and emulsifier in SWF did not obviously change the hydration products of the two cements (SAC and PC).

To consider the impact of the steam in preparing emergency operation procedures, the building atmosphere under various conditions is to be evaluated with reasonably low computational cost. A lumped parameter model to predict the transient behavior of the building atmosphere was developed, in which the evaporation from the spent fuel pool and the condensation to the wall were taken into consideration. A transient behavior of temperature and vapor concentration in a BWR operating floor was predicted with the model. The results and the prediction speed were compared to those of a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic calculation, and it was confirmed that the model could obtain almost the same results about 280,000 times faster. Parameter studies are conducted with the model, and dominant parameters to the evaporation and the condensation were clarified.

The distribution of the fission rates for the depleted uranium and enriched uranium in the two assemblies, as a function of the distance of the detection position to the centre, was measured using a plate fission chamber bombarded by D-T neutrons. The addition of a polyethylene shell significantly changed the neutron spectrum; in particular, the neutron fluxes with energies of 1 MeV and lower were changed. Using MCNP5 and the attached libraries, the fission rate experiments were simulated, and the experimental configuration, including the wall of the experimental hall, was described in detail in the model. The fission rate distributions for depleted uranium and enriched uranium in the two assemblies were reproducible. The difference between the calculated results with different libraries and different tallies is as small as 1.0%. By considering the neutron flux, the fission rate and the C/E values, it is concluded that the fission rates of depleted uranium and enriched uranium induced by the fast neutrons were overestimated, and it is proposed that the fission parameters of uranium for fast neutrons should be re-evaluated, or the margin of the concept design should be enlarged, to make the concept effective.

SOME CHARACTERISTICS AND EFFECTS OF NATURAL RADIATION	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on the Natural Radiation Environment (NRE)	SEP 22-26, 2014	Hirosaki, JAPAN	Hirosaki Univ, Int Atomic Energy Agcy			BACKGROUND-RADIATION; RADON; PROGENY; THORON; EARTH	Since life first appeared on the Earth, it has, in all its subsequent evolved forms including human, been exposed to natural radiation in the environment both from terrestrial and extra-terrestrial sources. Being an environmental mutagen, ionising natural radiation may have played a role of some significance in the evolution of early life forms on Earth. It has been estimated by United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation that at the present time, exposure to natural radiation globally results in an annual average individual effective dose of about 2.4 mSv. This represents about 80 % of the total dose from all sources. The three most important components of natural radiation exposure are cosmic radiation, terrestrial radioactivity and indoor radon. Each of these components exhibits both geographical and temporal variabilities with indoor radon exposure being the most variable and also the largest contributor to dose for most people. In this account, an overview is given of the characteristics of the main components of the natural radiation environment and some of their effects on humans. In the case of cosmic radiation, these range from radiation doses to aircrew and astronauts to the controversial topic of its possible effect on climate change. In the case of terrestrial natural radiation, accounts are given of a number of human exposure scenarios.	[Mc Laughlin, J.

THE HISTORY, DEVELOPMENT AND THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE RADON MEASUREMENT PROGRAMME IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on the Natural Radiation Environment (NRE)	SEP 22-26, 2014	Hirosaki, JAPAN	Hirosaki Univ, Int Atomic Energy Agcy			LUNG-CANCER; DAUGHTERS; DEPOSITION	The US radon measurement programme began in the late 1950s by the US Public Health Service in Colorado, New Mexico and Utah during the uranium frenzy. After the 1967 Congressional Hearings on the working conditions in uranium mines, the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was asked to conduct studies in active uranium mines to assess the exposure of the miners on the Colorado Plateau and in New Mexico. From 1967 to 1972, the Health and Safety Laboratory of the US AEC in New York investigated more than 20 uranium mines for radon and radon decay product concentrations and particle size in 4 large uranium mines in New Mexico. In 1970, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was established and took over some of the AEC radon measurement activities. Between 1975 and 1978, the Environmental Measurements Laboratory of the US Department of Energy conducted the first detailed indoor radon survey in the USA. Later in 1984, the very high concentrations of radon found in Pennsylvania homes set the wheels in motion and gave birth to the US Radon Industry. The US EPA expanded its involvement in radon issues and assumed an active role by establishing the National Radon Proficiency Program to evaluate the effectiveness of radon measurement and mitigation methods. In 1998, due to limited resources EPA privatised the radon programme. This paper presents a personal perspective of past events and current status of the US radon programme. It will present an update on radon health effects, the incidence rate of lung cancer in the USA and the number of radon measurements made from 1988 to 2013 using short-term test methods. More than 23 million measurements were made in the last 25 y and as a result more than 1.24 million homes were mitigated successfully. It is estimated that <2 % of the radon measurements performed in the USA are made using long-term testing devices. The number of homes above the US action level of 148 Bq m(-3) (4 pCi l(-1)) may be similar to 8.5 million because similar to 50 million homes were added since 1990 to the home inventory. This paper will discuss the current instruments and methods used to measure radon in the USA, and what is the effectiveness of radon resistant new construction, the current status of mitigation standards and the proposed testing protocols in schools and large buildings.			andycg137@aol.com					Angell W., 2014, COMMUNICATION; Angell W.J., 2008, RADIAT PROT DOSIM, V10, P1; Barros N.

The approach can be adapted for various types of study areas. The importance of collaboration among research institutions is discussed. Some developments include 25 documents; the redesign of the field equipment, such as the gamma survey meter, for convenient access to conduct measurement in various study areas; the method to collect and analyse radon gas from a natural gas pipeline and the manganese dioxide fibre to adsorb radium on-site for laboratory analysis. The NORM project in Thailand has been carried out for more than 10 y to support the development of NORM regulation in Thailand. In the previous studies as well as current, international standards for action levels have been adopted for safety purpose.

STATUS OF THE EUROPEAN ATLAS OF NATURAL RADIATION	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on the Natural Radiation Environment (NRE)	SEP 22-26, 2014	Hirosaki, JAPAN	Hirosaki Univ, Int Atomic Energy Agcy			INDOOR RADON MAP	According to the EURATOM (European Atomic Energy Community) Treaty, one of the missions of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission (EC) is to collect, process, evaluate and present data on environmental radioactivity. In 2006, the JRC started the 'European Atlas of Natural Radiation' project, in order to give an overview of the geographic distribution of sources of, and exposures to, natural radiation. As a first task, a map of indoor radon concentration was created, because in most cases this is the most important contribution to exposure, and since it could be expected that data collection would take quite some time, because radon (Rn) surveys are very differently advanced between European countries. The authors show the latest status of this map. A technically more ambitious map proved the one of the geogenic Rn potential (RP), due to heterogeneity of data sources across Europe and the need to develop models to estimate a harmonised quantity which adequately measures or classifies the RP.

The ratio ranged from 0.55 to 3.82. Based on the observation and a simplified time evolution model of Pb-214 and Bi-214 radioactivities during rainwater formation, the 'age' of raindrops ranged from sub-10 to several 100 min. The age would have negative correlation to rainfall intensity, but its variation for lower rainfall intensities was quite large. Secular equilibrium of Pb-214 and Bi-214 radioactivities in cloud water with airborne radon did not hold for some rainfall events.

The measurements show that arithmetic means +/- standard deviations of radon (Rn-222) concentration are 52.05 +/- 6.64, 0.29 +/- 0.26, 0.15 +/- 0.23 and 0.37 +/- 0.42 kBq m(-3) in spring water, surface water, large and small public water supplies, respectively. Only radon concentrations of two water samples collected in mountainous areas are more than 11.10 kBq m(-3), exceeding the limit of radon concentration in drinking water stipulated by the national standard of China (GB5749-2006). The annual effective doses due to radon in drinking water were also calculated. The investigation suggests that there are no risks caused by radon in the drinking water in SC.

The front-to-total activity ratio is a critical factor in describing the self-shielding effect of the wire screens. In this study, computational fluid dynamic method was applied to simulate the deposition of aerosols on the surface of the wire screens. Four different types of screens were investigated for particle size varying from 1 nm to 10 mm. Experimental verification was carried out in a radon chamber. The results showed good agreement between experimental data interception and the simulation. Significant differences on the front-to-total activity ratio for the different types of screens were observed when the size of particle was <20 nm.

The measurements of soil gas radon concentrations were performed by using an AlphaGUARD monitor. The Ra-226 content analysis was performed by gamma spectrometry (high pure germanium) and permeabilities were performed by using the RADON-JOK permeameter. The GEORP indicator and soil radon index (RI) were also calculated. Approximately 53 % of the Perferric Red Latosols measurement site could be classified as 'high risk' (Swedish criteria). The Litholic Neosols presented the lowest radon concentration mean in soil gas. The Perferric Red Latosols presented significantly high radon concentration mean in soil gas (60.6 +/- 8.7 kBq m(-3)), high indoor radon concentration, high RI, Ra-226 content and GEORP. The preliminary results may indicate an influence of iron formations present very close to the Perferric Red Latosols in the retention of uranium minerals.	[Lara, E.; Santos, T. O.; Oliveira, A.

Dose estimations for inhabitants living in houses built using these tiles were also carried out. The activity concentrations of Ra-226, Ra-228 and K-40 in the man-made tiles were 31-170, 35-110 and 260-980 Bq kg(-1), respectively. The Rn-222 exhalation rates in the tiles were 8.8-21 mu Bq m(-2) s(-1). The ranges of experimental activity concentrations and Rn-222 exhalation rates were almost identical to those of natural rocks used as typical building materials in Japan. The maximum value of effective dose to inhabitants living in houses built with the man-made tiles was 0.14 mSv y(-1), which is lower than the reference level range (1-20 mSv y(-1)) for abnormally high levels of natural background radiation published in the ICRP Publication 103.

ESTIMATION OF RADON EMANATION COEFFICIENT FOR REPRESENTATIVE SOILS IN OKINAWA, JAPAN	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on the Natural Radiation Environment (NRE)	SEP 22-26, 2014	Hirosaki, JAPAN	Hirosaki Univ, Int Atomic Energy Agcy			THORON EXHALATION RATES	Radon (Rn-222) emanation coefficients for the representative soils distributed in Okinawa Island, Japan, have been estimated empirically. Arithmetic means of the emanation coefficients for dry and moist conditions were calculated to be 0.19 and 0.29, respectively. In Okinawa, the soils are traditionally classified into three types, namely the dark red soils, the residual regosols and the red and yellow soils. The dark red soils have relatively high coefficients. The residual regosols and the red and yellow soils have relatively low coefficients. To investigate the variable factor of the emanation coefficients, analyses of radioactive elements and physical properties have also been performed on the soils. For the dark red soils, the contents of the fine particle and the Ra-226 are relatively higher than those for the other soils. Based on these results, it is suggested that the variation in the radon emanation coefficient is mainly regulated by the Ra-226 concentration, the particle sizes and the water contents of the soils.

PREPARATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF CERAMIC-BASED THORON SOURCES FOR THORON CALIBRATION CHAMBER	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on the Natural Radiation Environment (NRE)	SEP 22-26, 2014	Hirosaki, JAPAN	Hirosaki Univ, Int Atomic Energy Agcy			RADON; PROGENY; DWELLINGS; HUNGARY; JAPAN; INDIA; NIRS	The aim of this study is to explore the correlations between the properties of the source's material and the thoron flux produced. This means a complex procedure that involves morphological characterisation (the determination of specific surface area and pore size distribution) and thoron emanation and exhalation measurements as well. In this work, the preparation of 27 thoron sources has been carried out. Three types of ceramics with different morphological properties were used as a matrix material with three different thorium contents. Spheres were formed from the dollop, and they were fired at different temperatures (200, 600 and 900 degrees C). The phase analysis of the samples was performed by powder X-ray diffraction. The pore size distribution was determined by mercury penetration. The thoron emanation was measured using an accumulation chamber; the measured thoron emanation coefficients were from 0.34 +/- 0.03 to 7.69 +/- 0.13 %. Based on the results, the preparation parameters of the thoron source optimised for the calibration procedure have been given.

THE OPTIMISATION OF ELECTROKINETIC REMEDIATION FOR HEAVY METALS AND RADIOACTIVITY CONTAMINATION ON HOLYROOD-LUNAS SOIL (ACRISOL SPECIES) IN SRI GADING INDUSTRIAL AREA, BATU PAHAT, JOHOR, MALAYSIA	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on the Natural Radiation Environment (NRE)	SEP 22-26, 2014	Hirosaki, JAPAN	Hirosaki Univ, Int Atomic Energy Agcy				The optimisation of electrokinetic remediation of an alluvial soil, locally named as Holyrood-Lunas from Sri Gading Industrial Area, Batu Pahat, Johor, Malaysia, had been conducted in this research. This particular soil was chosen due to its relatively high level of background radiation in a range between 139.2 and 539.4 nGy h(-1). As the background radiation is correlated to the amount of parent nuclides, U-238 and Th-232, hence, a remediation technique, such as electrokinetic, is very useful in reducing these particular concentrations of heavy metal and radionuclides in soils. Several series of electrokinetics experiments were performed in laboratory scale in order to study the influence of certain electrokinetic parameters in soil. The concentration before (pre-electrokinetic) and after the experiment (post-electrokinetic) was determined via X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis technique. The best electrokinetic parameter that contributed to the highest achievable concentration removal of heavy metals and radionuclides on each experimental series was incorporated into a final electrokinetic experiment. Here, High Pure Germanium (HPGe) was used for radioactivity elemental analysis. The XRF results suggested that the most optimised electrokinetic parameters for Cr, Ni, Zn, As, Pb, Th and U were 3.0 h, 90 volts, 22.0 cm, plate-shaped electrode by 8 x 8 cm and in 1-D configuration order whereas the selected optimised electrokinetic parameters gave very low reduction of U-238 and Th-232 at 0.23 +/- 2.64 and 2.74 +/- 23.78 ppm, respectively.

MEASUREMENT OF RADIOACTIVITY AND HEAVY METAL LEVELS IN EDIBLE VEGETABLES AND THEIR IMPACT ON KUALA SELANGOR COMMUNITIES OF PENINSULAR MALAYSIA	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on the Natural Radiation Environment (NRE)	SEP 22-26, 2014	Hirosaki, JAPAN	Hirosaki Univ, Int Atomic Energy Agcy			DE-JANEIRO CITY; HEALTH-RISK; INHABITANTS; RA-226; K-40; SOIL; TH-232; FOODSTUFFS; INGESTION; CS-137	Vegetable is an essential daily diet item for the people of Malaysia. This work addressed the radiation and heavy metal exposure scenarios through the consumption of vegetables. Kuala Selangor is located in Sungai Selangor estuary in the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia, which is susceptible to pollution load due to the presence of large-scale industrial and human activities. Radioactivity and heavy metals level in human diet is of particular concern for the assessment of possible radiological and chemical hazards to human health. Therefore, a comprehensive study was carried out to determine the radioactivity levels (Ra-226, Ra-228 and K-40) and heavy metal concentrations (Cr, As, Cd, Mn, Mg, Al, Sr, Rb, Sb, Ba, Hg, Fe, Ni, Zn, Cu, Bi and Pb) in 10 varieties of vegetable collected from different farmlands in Kuala Selangor region. The committed doses for Ra-226, Ra-228 and K-40 due to consumption of vegetables were found 16.6 +/- 1.3, 23.6 +/- 1.7 and 58 +/- 5 mu Sv y(-1), respectively, with a total of 98 +/- 8 mSv y(-1). This dose imposes no significant threat to human health. The estimated cancer risk shows that probability of increase in cancer risk from daily intake of vegetables is only a minor fraction of International Commission on Radiological Protection values. The concentrations of heavy metal were below the daily intake recommended by the international organisations.	[Asaduzzaman, Kh.; Khandaker, M. U.; Amin, Y.

AN EXPERIMENTAL METHOD FOR QUANTITATIVELY EVALUATING THE ELEMENTAL PROCESSES OF INDOOR RADIOACTIVE AEROSOL BEHAVIOR	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on the Natural Radiation Environment (NRE)	SEP 22-26, 2014	Hirosaki, JAPAN	Hirosaki Univ, Int Atomic Energy Agcy			RADON DECAY PRODUCTS; SIZE DISTRIBUTION	An experimental method for quantitatively evaluating the elemental processes governing the indoor behaviour of naturally occurring radioactive aerosols was proposed. This method utilises transient response of aerosol concentrations to an artificial change in aerosol removal rate by turning on and off an air purifier. It was shown that the indoor-outdoor exchange rate and the indoor deposition rate could be estimated by a continuous measurement of outdoor and indoor aerosol number concentration measurements and by the method proposed in this study. Although the scatter of the estimated parameters is relatively large, both the methods gave consistent results. It was also found that the size distribution of radioactive aerosol particles and hence activity median aerodynamic diameter remained not largely affected by the operation of the air purifier, implying the predominance of the exchange and deposition processes over other processes causing change in the size distribution such as the size growth by co-agulation and the size dependence of deposition.

During April 2006-October 2008, that spent fuel was cut and chemically processed, the plant discharged I-129 into the atmosphere and coastal waters. To study I-129 behaviour in brackish Lake Obuchi, which is adjacent to the plant, I-129 concentrations in aquatic biota were measured by accelerator mass spectrometry. Owing to I-129 discharge from the plant, the I-129 concentration in the biota started to rise from the background concentration in 2006 and was high during 2007-08. The I-129 concentration has been rapidly decreasing after the fuel cutting and chemically processing were finished. The I-129 concentration factors in the biota were higher than those reported by IAEA for marine organisms and similar to those reported for freshwater biota. The estimated annual committed effective dose due to ingestion of foods with the maximum I-129 concentration in the biota samples was 2.8 nSv y(-1).

VARIATION OF ATMOSPHERIC TRITIUM CONCENTRATION IN THREE CHEMICAL FORMS AT TOKI, JAPAN: 2004-12	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on the Natural Radiation Environment (NRE)	SEP 22-26, 2014	Hirosaki, JAPAN	Hirosaki Univ, Int Atomic Energy Agcy			HYDROGEN; FUKUOKA; WATER; HT	Atmospheric tritium concentrations of HTO, HT and CH3T have been measured at Toki, Japan, for the environmental impact assessment of tritium for a fusion test facility. According to the data from 2004 to 2012, the concentrations of HT and HTO in water vapour tend to increase in spring. The seasonal variation in HT concentration at Toki was compared with the H-2 concentration between 1990 and 2005 at Tae-ahn Peninsula, Republic of Korea, which is at approximately the same latitude as Toki. The monthly average of HT-specific activity varied from 1.24 x 10(5) to 1.76 x 10(5) TU. The peak of the monthly average H-2 concentration did not match that of HT. This indicates that the mechanism of the production or the source of HT might be different from the production mechanism of H-2.

Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy revealed that microbial mat contains iron, aluminium, silicon and phosphorus. Model experiment revealed that the potassium was adsorbed by living microorganism in the microbial mats, while it was not adsorbed by dead microbial mat. Iron was adsorbed by both living and dead microbial mats. The present results explain the increase in the total beta-radioactivity of water sample in summer and the decrease in winter.

NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY AND EFFECTIVE DOSE DUE TO THE BOTTOM SEA AND ESTUARIES MARINE ANIMALS IN THE COASTAL WATERS AROUND PENINSULAR MALAYSIA	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on the Natural Radiation Environment (NRE)	SEP 22-26, 2014	Hirosaki, JAPAN	Hirosaki Univ, Int Atomic Energy Agcy			RADIONUCLIDES; FISH; SEDIMENT; MUSSEL; INDIA; OIL	Malaysia is among the countries with the highest fish consumption in the world and relies on seafood as a main source of animal protein. Thus, the radioactivity in the mostly consumed marine animals such as fishes, crustaceans and molluscs collected from the coastal waters around Peninsular Malaysia has been determined to monitor the level of human exposure by natural radiation via seafood consumption. The mean activity concentrations of naturally occurring radionuclides Ra-226 (U-238), Ra-228 (Th-232) and K-40 ranged from 0.67 +/- 0.19 Bq kg(-1) (Perna viridis) to 1.20 +/- 0.70 Bq kg(-1) (Rastrelliger), from 0.19 +/- 0.17 Bq kg(-1) (Teuthida) to 0.82 +/- 0.67 Bq kg(-1) (Caridea) and from 34 +/- 13 Bq kg(-1) (Caridea) to 48 +/- 24 Bq kg(-1) (Teuthida), respectively. The mean annual committed effective dose due to the individual radionuclides shows an order of Ra-228 > Ra-226 > K-40 in all marine samples. The obtained doses are less than the global internal dose of 290 mu Sv y(-1) set by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, discarding any significant radiological risks to the populace of Peninsular Malaysia.

The H-3 concentrations in most of the surface-and shallow-well samples (<0.03-0.57 Bq l(-1)) were similar to those in precipitation (annual mean: 0.31-0.79 Bq l(-1)), suggesting that the residence time of the water in those wells was 0-15 y. The H-3 concentrations in the samples from a 26-m-deep well and the 150-m-deep well were lower than those in the other wells, indicating that groundwater with a long residence time exists in deep aquifers and the estuary area of the catchment. It is not clear whether H-3 released during test operation of the plant with actual spent nuclear fuel affected the H-3 concentrations observed in this study.

EFFECT ON RADIOACTIVITY CONCENTRATION ESTIMATION OF RADON PROGENIES WITH NAI(TL) PULSE HEIGHT DISTRIBUTION FROM CONSIDERING GEOMETRIC STRUCTURE AROUND DETECTOR AND INFILTRATION OF RADIONUCLIDES	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on the Natural Radiation Environment (NRE)	SEP 22-26, 2014	Hirosaki, JAPAN	Hirosaki Univ, Int Atomic Energy Agcy			GAMMA DOSE-RATE	The surface radioactivity concentrations of the radon progenies, Pb-214 and Bi-214, were estimated from NaI( Tl) pulse height distributions during rain. The improvement in estimation errors caused by considering geometric structures around measuring points and infiltration of radionuclides was discussed. The surface radioactivity concentrations were determined by comparing the count rates at the full-energy peak ranges between observation and calculation with the electron-photon transport code EGS5. It was shown that the concentrations can be underestimated by about 30 % unless the obstacles around the detector or infiltration of radionuclides are considered in gamma ray transfer calculations at measuring points, where there are many tall obstacles, or the ground is covered with unpaved areas.

Samples were regularly collected from pine trees on the National Institute for Fusion Science campus (1998-2012) and the nearby Shiomi Park (SP; 2002-12). FWT and OBT concentrations of the former samples ranged from 0.33 to 0.92 and 0.41 to 1.10 Bq l(-1), respectively, while those of the latter samples ranged from 0.32 to 0.86 and 0.33 to 0.79 Bq l(-1), respectively. Results of both sampling sites were almost the same, and they have been gradually decreased year by year. Concentration level of tritium for Toki City was close to the average background level in Japan. The OBT/FWT ratios were almost 1.0. The apparent half-life of FWT in this period was estimated as almost 10 y, and that of OBT was estimated as almost 12 y; these values were almost the same as the physical half-life.

All of these sources have contributed to an increase in the levels of environmental radioactivity and population radiation doses. This paper presents the activity level due to the presence of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 in soil samples of Purola area in Garhwal Himalaya region. The measured activity of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 in collected soil samples of Purola was found to vary from 13 +/- 10 to 55 +/- 10 Bq kg(-1) with an average of 31 +/- 2 Bq kg(-1), 13 +/- 10 to 101 +/- 13 Bq kg(-1) with an average 30 +/- 3 Bq kg(-1) and 150 +/- 81 to 1310 +/- 154 Bq kg(-1) with an average 583 +/- 30 Bq kg(-1), respectively. The radium equivalent activity in collected soil samples was found to vary from 47 to 221 Bq kg(-1) with an average of 115 Bq kg(-1). The total absorbed gamma dose rate in this area was found to vary from 22 to 93 nGy h(-1) with an average of 55 nGy h(-1). The distribution of these radionuclides in the soil of study area is discussed in details.	[Yadav, Manjulata; Rawat, Mukesh; Dangwal, Anoop; Prasad, Mukesh; Gusain, G. S.; Ramola, R.

NON-DESTRUCTIVE DETERMINATION OF URANIUM, THORIUM AND K-40 IN TOBACCO AND THEIR IMPLICATION ON RADIATION DOSE LEVELS TO THE HUMAN BODY	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on the Natural Radiation Environment (NRE)	SEP 22-26, 2014	Hirosaki, JAPAN	Hirosaki Univ, Int Atomic Energy Agcy			NEUTRON-ACTIVATION ANALYSIS; RESPIRATORY-TRACT; ICP-MS; SMOKE; CIGARETTES; RETENTION; RADIOACTIVITY; SPECTROMETRY; SAMPLES; METALS	The naturally occurring radionuclides of U-235, U-238 and Th-232 and their daughter products are a potential major source of anthropogenic radiation to tobacco smokers. Often overlooked is the presence of K-40 in tobacco and its implication to radiation dose accumulation in the human body. In this study, these three radiation sources have been determined in four typical US cigarettes using neutron activation analysis (NAA). The NAA reactions of U-238(n, g) U-239, Th-232(n, gamma) Th-233 and K-41(n, gamma) K-42 were used to determine U-235, U-238 and Th-232 and K-40, respectively. The activity of U-238 can easily be determined by epithermal NAA of the U-238(n, gamma) 239U reaction, and the activity of (235), (234)(U) can easily be deduced. Using isotopic ratios, the activity due to K-40 was found by the determined concentrations of K-41 (also by epithermal neutrons) in the bulk material. Each gram of total potassium yields 30 Bq of K-40. The annual effective dose for smokers using 20 cigarettes per day was calculate to be 14.6, 137 and 9 mu Sv y(-1) for U-238,U-235,U-234, Th-232 and K-40, respectively. These values are significantly lower that the dose received from Po-210 except for Th-232.

The potential hazard of the excessively added technically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material (TENORM) in consumer products should be assessed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the organ equivalent dose and the annual effective dose with the usage of the TENORM added in paints. The activities of gammas emitted from natural radionuclides in the five types of paints were measured with the high-purity germanium detector, and the annual effective dose was assessed with the computational human phantom and the Monte Carlo method. The results show that uranium and thorium series were mainly measured over the five paints. Based on the exposure scenario of the paints in the room, the highest effective dose was evaluated as < 1 mSv y(-1) of the public dose limit.

Gamma dose survey indicated a possible high radiation risk for this area. Rock, soil and hot spring mud samples were collected and analysed by a low background gamma spectrometer. The activity concentrations of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 in samples were 151-139 092 (mean = 13 794), 12-596 (127), 24- 616 (215) Bq kg(-1), respectively. X- ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that quartz and calcite (CaCO3) are the main constituents in mud samples with varying contents. In conclusion, this study area was reasonably classified as a high natural background radiation area. The source of radium in this area is supposed to be related to the fault fluids enriched in radium that precipitated with calcium in the carbonate terrain and partly absorbed by high cation exchange capacity clays.

THE INFLUENCE OF THORON ON INSTRUMENTS MEASURING RADON ACTIVITY CONCENTRATION	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on the Natural Radiation Environment (NRE)	SEP 22-26, 2014	Hirosaki, JAPAN	Hirosaki Univ, Int Atomic Energy Agcy			DETECTORS	Thoron, the isotope 220 of radon, is a radionuclide whose concentration may influence the measurement of the activity concentration of Rn-222 in the air. If in the case of continuous and active sampling measuring instruments, using a pump for example, the influence of thoron on radon measurement is obvious and is taken into account in the apparatus, it is often assumed that in the case of a passive sampling, by diffusion through a filter for example, this thoron influence is negligible. This is due to the very short radioactive half-life of thoron, 55.6 s (3.82 d for Rn-222), and the assumption that the diffusion time of thoron in the detection chamber is long enough beside that of the thoron half-life. The objective of this study is to check whether this assumption is true or not for different kinds of commercial electronic apparatus used to measure radon activity concentration from soil to dwellings. First of all, the devices were calibrated in activity concentration of radon, and then they were exposed to a controlled thoron atmosphere. The experiments concerning the thoron aimed to investigate the sensitivity to thoron in the radon measuring mode of the apparatus. Results of these experiments show that all devices have a very quick answer to thoron atmosphere, even though the sensitivities vary from one instrument to another. Results clearly show that this influence on radon measurement due to the thoron is observed also after the exposition because of the decay of Pb-212 and its progenies. In conclusion, the sensitivity to thoron in the radon measuring mode depends strongly on the type of instruments. The results of the present investigation show that for some apparatus, the influence of thoron cannot be disregarded especially when measuring radon in soil.

In each set of experiments, dechorionated zebrafish embryos were divided into 4 groups, each having 10 embryos: Group (C) in which the embryos did not receive any further treatment; Group (IU) in which the embryos received an alpha-particle dose of 0.44 mGy at 5 hpf and were then exposed to 100 mu g l(-1) of DU from 5 to 6 hpf; Group (I) in which the embryos received an alpha-particle dose of 0.44 mGy at 5 hpf and Group (U) in which the dechorionated embryos were exposed to 100 mg l(-1) of DU from 5 to 6 hpf. The authors confirmed that an alpha-particle dose of 0.44 mGy and a DU exposure for 1 h separately led to hormetic and toxic effects assessed by counting apoptotic signals, respectively, in the zebrafish. Interestingly, the combined exposure led to an effect more toxic than that caused by the DU exposure alone, so effectively DU changed the beneficial effect (hormesis) brought about by alpha-particle irradiation into an apparently toxic effect. This could be explained in terms of the promotion of early death of cells predisposed to spontaneous transformation by the small alpha-particle dose (i.e. hormetic effect) and the postponement of cell death upon DU exposure.

ESTIMATION OF (KR)-K-85 DISPERSION FROM THE SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL REPROCESSING PLANT IN ROKKASHO, JAPAN, USING AN ATMOSPHERIC DISPERSION MODEL	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on the Natural Radiation Environment (NRE)	SEP 22-26, 2014	Hirosaki, JAPAN	Hirosaki Univ, Int Atomic Energy Agcy				The spent nuclear fuel reprocessing plant of Japan Nuclear Fuel Limited (JNFL) located in Rokkasho, Japan, discharged small amounts of Kr-85 into the atmosphere during final tests of the plant with actual spent fuel from 31 March 2006 to October 2008. During this period, the gamma-ray dose rates due to discharged 85Kr were higher than the background rates measured at the Institute for Environmental Sciences and at seven monitoring stations of the Aomori prefectural government and JNFL. The dispersion of 85Kr was simulated by means of the fifth-generation Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale Model and the CG-MATHEW/ADPIC models (ver .5.0) with a vertical terrain-following height coordinate. Although the simulated gamma-ray dose rates due to discharged 85Kr agreed fairly well with measured rates, the agreement between the estimated monthly mean 85Kr concentrations and the observed concentrations was poor. Improvement of the vertical flow of air may lead to better estimation of 85Kr dispersion.

To confirm that the ecological half-lives are appropriate for predicting ambient dose equivalent rates within living areas, it is important to ascertain ambient dose equivalent rates on/around roads. In this study, radiation monitoring on/around roads at Kawamata town, located about 37 km northwest of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, was performed using monitoring vehicles and survey meters. It was found that the ambient dose equivalent rates around roads were higher than those on roads as of October 2012. And withal the ecological half-lives on roads were essentially consistent with those around roads. With dose predictions using ecological half-lives on roads, it is necessary to make corrections to ambient dose equivalent rates through the vehicle-borne surveys against those within living areas.

VARIABILITY OF RADIOCAESIUM INVENTORY IN FUKUSHIMA SOIL CORES FROM ONE SITE MEASURED AT DIFFERENT TIMES	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on the Natural Radiation Environment (NRE)	SEP 22-26, 2014	Hirosaki, JAPAN	Hirosaki Univ, Int Atomic Energy Agcy			POWER-PLANT ACCIDENT; RADIONUCLIDES	The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident has resulted in the deposition of radioactive contamination of soils mainly by Cs-134 and Cs-137. The contaminated areas are of a great concern since external radiation may lead to significant long-term doses to humans and animals. External dose rate above ground will decrease with physical decay of the radionuclides and as they migrate deeper into the soil with time. In the present study, depth profiles of Cs radioisotopes have been studied at different times over a period of 1 y. Radiocaesium inventories for Cs-134 and Cs-137 down to a depth of 10 cm at the four measurement times varied from 2.09 to 4.14 MBq m(-2) with coefficient of variation (CV): 27.4 %, n = 4 and from 2.13 to 4.23 MBq m(-2) with CV: 27.3 %, n = 4, respectively. The activity ratio for Cs-134/Cs-137 decreased from 0.62 to 0.46 during 1 y of measurement i.e. July 2012 to June 2013. However, the ratio with decay correction (15 March 2011) was found to be constant similar to 1, indicating contamination from FDNPP origin. In order to understand the radiocaesium distribution in soil profile, physico-chemical characterisation of soil has been carried out.	[Mishra, S.; Sahoo, S.

In addition, the observed Cs-137 concentration was increased over the background level. The gaseous I-131 concentration in air observed in April was higher than that observed in March immediately after the accident. Using a backward trajectory analysis, the authors found that the air mass had passed the vicinity of the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant when the gaseous I-131 concentration in air was increasing. Maximum I-131 and radioactive Cs concentrations in daily fallout samples collected in Aomori city were observed on 28 April, when I-131 was also detected in air. Cs-134 and Cs-137 concentration ratios in pine needles and pasture grass were nearly equal to 1, which indicates that the source of these radionuclides was the nuclear power plant accident.

These were based on a strong cooperation between local governments and experts. Ambient dose rate and radioactivity of foodstuff produced inside of the city have been monitored. Representative ambient dose rates around living environments have almost already become their original levels of the pre-accident because of the decontamination activity, natural washout and effective half-lives of radioactivity. The internal annual dose due to radioactive cesium under the policy of 'Local Production for Local Consumption' is estimated as extremely low comparing the variation range due to natural radioactivity. Systematic survey around a retention basin has been started. All of these latest monitoring data would be one of the core information for the policy making as well as a cost-benefit discussion and risk communication.

Calculation of dose conversion factors for doses in the fingernails to organ doses at external gamma irradiation in air	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article						Gamma irradiation; EPR dosimetry; Fingernails; Monte-Carlo	ELECTRON-PARAMAGNETIC-RESONANCE; TOOTH ENAMEL; HUMAN NAIL; COEFFICIENTS; DOSIMETRY; NEUTRON; ENERGY	Absorbed doses to fingernails and organs were calculated for a set of homogenous external gamma-ray irradiation geometries in air. The doses were obtained by stochastic modeling of the ionizing particle transport (Monte Carlo method) for a mathematical human phantom with arms and hands placed loosely along the sides of the body. The resulting dose conversion factors for absorbed doses in fingernails can be used to assess the dose distribution and magnitude in practical dose reconstruction problems. For purposes of estimating dose in a large population exposed to radiation in order to triage people for treatment of acute radiation syndrome, the calculated data for a range of energies having a width of from 0.05 to 3.5 MeV were used to convert absorbed doses in fingernails to corresponding doses in organs and the whole body as well as the effective dose. Doses were assessed based on assumed rates of radioactive fallout at different time periods following a nuclear explosion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Khailov, A. M.; Ivannikov, A.

We evaluated a CXRD and visualized the distribution of radioactivity in the contaminated area near the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power station, where the ambient dose equivalent rate was 2.1 mu Sv/h at 1 m above ground level. We found a good correlation between the characteristic X-ray fluxes and the distribution of radioactive contaminants with a 0.823 Pearson product moment correlation coefficient.

The Material Plasma Exposure eXperiment (MPEX) will explore plasma-material interaction under fusion reactor plasma conditions. Samples with accumulated displacement damage (characterized by displacements per atom) produced by fast neutron irradiations in the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory will be studied in the MPEX facility. This paper presents assessments of the calculated induced radioactivity and resulting radiation dose rates of a variety of potential fusion reactor plasma-facing materials, e.g., tungsten. The scientific code packages Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) and Standardized Computer Analyses for Licensing Evaluation (SCALE) were used to simulate irradiation of the samples in HFIR. This included the generation and depletion of nuclides in the material and the subsequent composition, activity levels, gamma radiation fields, and resultant dose rates as a function of cooling time. A challenge of the MPEX project is to minimize the radioactive inventory in the preparation of the samples and the sample dose rates for inclusion in the MPEX facility.

DEPENDENCE OF TRITIUM RELEASE FROM STAINLESS STEEL ON TEMPERATURE AND WATER VAPOR	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						tritium; humidity-stimulated decontamination; temperature-driven decontamination	AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; SURFACE; DESORPTION; TRANSPORT; EVOLUTION; SS316	The impact of water vapor and temperature on the release of tritium from stainless steel was studied. Degreased stainless steel samples loaded with tritium at room temperature following a 24-h degassing in vacuum at room temperature were subjected to increasing temperatures or humidity. In general, increasing either the sample temperature or the humidity causes an increased quantity of tritium to be removed. Increasing the temperature to 300 degrees C in a dry gas stream results in a significant release of tritium and is therefore an effective means for reducing the tritium inventory in steel. For humid purges at 30 degrees C, a sixfold increase in humidity results in a tenfold increase in the peak outgassing rate. Increasing the humidity from 4 parts per million (ppm) to 1000 ppm when the sample temperature is 100 degrees C causes a significant increase in the tritium outgassing rate. Finally, a simple calculation shows that only 15% of the activity present in the sample was removed in these experiments, suggesting that the surface layer of adsorbed water participates in regulating tritium desorption from the surface.

The aim is to develop China's next-step fusion device. A helium-cooled ceramic breeder (HCCB) blanket concept has been put forward by the blanket integration design team of the Institute of Plasma Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The present blanket configuration is based on the upper port dimension and maintenance scheme. The HCCB blanket comprises a U-shaped first wall, cap, breeder unit, middle plate, and back plate. The breeder unit includes a cooling plate, beryllium pebble bed, and lithium silicate pebble bed. The structure of the HCCB blanket concept is obviously different from the ITER HCCB test blanket module of China. The CFETR HCCB blanket will meet the requirements of CFETR long-pulse or steady-state operation with a duty cycle time greater than 0.3. The maintenance scheme of the blanket is introduced in this paper. Three-dimensional neutronic analysis results show that the tritium breeding ratio can satisfy the design requirement. Besides, the thermal-hydraulic behavior of the first wall has been studied using ANSYS CFX code.

One of the most important factors affecting the ice layer quality is the thermal environment around the capsule, which determines the low-mode thickness asymmetries of the D-T ice layer. In this paper, we report the thermal simulation results for the hohlraum cryogenic target in the China Academy of Engineering Physics, focusing on the ice layer roughness analysis and low-mode control. The simulations were carried out with a computational fluid dynamics code. A calculation procedure based on the dynamic mesh method was applied to predict the D-T ice layer profile. The sensitivity of ice layer low-mode roughness to some operating and thermal condition has been investigated. The conclusions in this paper provide better direction for our cryogenic target's further design and improvement.

Impact of Magnesium Oxide Preparation Conditions on Iodine Adsorption Capacity	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							TEMPERATURE; POWDERS	Radioactive iodine gas is a problematic species in multiple nuclear energy related applications. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop an adsorbent that has a high capacity for iodine. In this investigation, the iodine adsorption capacity of high-purity magnesium oxide was investigated as a function of the calcination conditions. Differences in the magnesia substrates were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, and the iodine adsorption capacity was determined using thermogravimetric analysis. The results indicate that the calcination temperature and time have a significant impact on the adsorption capacity, with longer times and higher temperatures having a negative impact. However, under the optimal calcination conditions identified in this study (550 degrees C for 20 min), the high-purity magnesia was found to have an adsorption capacity >300 mg of iodine per gram of sorbent. This suggests that magnesia holds promise for nuclear applications where iodine gas adsorption would be beneficial.

COSI6: A TOOL FOR NUCLEAR TRANSITION SCENARIO STUDIES AND APPLICATION TO SFR DEPLOYMENT SCENARIOS WITH MINOR ACTINIDE TRANSMUTATION	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						nuclear transition scenario studies with COSI; SFR deployment; minor actinide transmutation		Nuclear systems, composed of reactors with varied fuel and cycle facilities (enrichment plant, fabrication plant, reprocessing plant, etc.), are complex and in constant evolution. Since 1985, the CEA has been developing the simulation software COSI to study different trajectories of nuclear fleet evolution and provide technical elements to decision makers. The principle of COSI, including the typical composition of the data set, is exposed. To evaluate as accurately as possible the isotopic compositions of materials, several physical models are implemented in COSI. The main ones, the evolution calculation and the equivalence models, are described in detail. An exercise of validation of COSI carried out on the French pressurized water reactor (PWR) historical nuclear fleet until 2010 is also presented, as well as a methodology for propagation of input uncertainties on COSI results. To illustrate the possibilities of COSI, the results of different scenarios studied in the framework of the French Act for Waste Management are discussed. The objective of these scenarios is to evaluate the feasibility of sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR) deployment to renew the French PWR fleet on different timescales and to analyze the costs and the benefits of different options of minor actinide (MA) partitioning and transmutation. The impacts of SFR deployment on cycle facilities such as the fabrication plant, the spent fuel storage, and the reprocessing plant are minimized. The SFR deployment appears to be feasible with regard to fissile material availability, with an adaptation of fuel cooling time before reprocessing or of SFR breeding gain. Minor actinide transmutation in homogeneous mode (MA diluted in core) and transmutation in heterogeneous mode (in MA-bearing blankets) are compared not only according to their impacts on cycle facilities and on ultimate waste but also according to the reduction of their inventories. The increases in fresh fuel thermal power and spent fuel decay heat due to the addition of MAs in fuels are quantified. The cases of transmutation of all MAs (americium, neptunium, and curium) and of americium only are distinguished. Alternative scenarios are explored to overcome the challenges associated with each option: reduction of the maximal MA content in fresh SFR fuel in the case of homogeneous transmutation and reduction of interim MA storage in the case of heterogeneous transmutation.
