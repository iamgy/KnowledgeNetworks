Twenty most abundant FP elements were taken into account in the system of U-Zr-H-O-FP in which oxygen is treated as an impurity. The Thermo-Gale computer code was used to calculate the equilibrium state of the multi-phase and multi-component system. This calculation shows that yttrium, the alkaline earth metals (Ba, Sr) and most of the lanthanides prefer to form corresponding binary hydrides. Oxygen impurities in the system are likely to form a mixture of Y2O3, Pr-2 O-3. Sm2O3 as well as Ce2O3 depending on their fission yields. With increasing of burn-up, only a slight decrease of the hydrogen potential in the fuel pin can be expected because of the very little consumption of hydrogen in the hydrogenation process of the FP. In the gas phase, H-2, Cs, Rb, CsRb as well as CsI are the main vapor species apart from the noble gases Xe and Kr. Solid swelling of the fuel due to formation of condensed phases was calculated as a function of burn-up. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

These methods enabled us to obtain the heat capacity and thermal conductivity from basic properties, viz., the lattice parameter, linear thermal expansion coefficient, and compressibility. Results for UO2 showed both the existence of a Bredig transition and a peak in the heat capacity at high temperature. The lattice parameter, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity of MOX fuel were calculated from basic properties of UO2 and PuO2. These results showed that molecular dynamics techniques can be usefully applied to determine physicochemical properties of MOX fuel. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B,V, All rights reserved.

The representativity of the layers for the bulk system will be validated and it will be shown, both on theoretical and experimental grounds, that layers of stoichiometric UO2 can be produced by this method. A comparison will be made between X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) results on bulk UO2 and on the deposited layers. The films deposited can easily be doped with other elements, such as fission products, by codepositing these elements with the UO2. This codeposition technique has subsequently been used to produce layers of UO2 containing cesium. It will be demonstrated that the codeposition with cesium produces uranium in higher valence states (up to U-V1). while without cesium, no higher uranium valencies can be obtained.

The solubility limit of Pu in La2Zr2O7 was studied by X-ray diffraction, and the solubility limits of Pu in pyrochlore-type phase prepared in air, vacuum and Ar-8%H-2 atmospheres were determined to be 10, 35 and 100 mol%, respectively. The compound with 80 mol% Pu prepared in air and the compounds with 80 and 100 mol% Pu prepared in vacuum showed single fluorite-type phases. Thermal expansion coefficients of (La1-xPux)(2)Zr2O7+y (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10 and 0.80) were also measured by high-temperature X-ray diffraction at temperatures between room temperature and 1273 K in air and He-8%H-2 atmospheres and were found to increase with increasing Pu content. The dependence of the linear thermal expansion coefficients on Pu content is discussed from the point of view of the radii of both tetravalent Pu in air and trivalent Pu in He-8%H2.

The Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity of URu2Si2 and U2Ru3Si5 were measured in the temperature range from 300 to 1100 K and Hall coefficient at room temperature. The Seebeck coefficients of URu2Si2 and U2Ru3Si5 were obtained to be -48.9 and -32.8 muV K-1 at 1100 K, respectively. The temperature dependences of the electrical resistivities for URu2Si2 and U2Ru3Si5 were small, which are similar to that of uranium metal rather than that of silicon semiconductor. As thermoelectric materials for high temperatures. URu2Si2 and U2Ru3Si5 were thought to be not promising. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The thermoelectric power of each sample decreased with decreasing temperature, but a slight saturation of the decrease due to phonon-drag effect was observed below 120 K for both boron isotope enriched samples. The resistivity decreased with decreasing temperature and there existed no large difference among the resistivities of natural boron. boron-10 enriched and boron-11 enriched samples. The figure of merit for thermoelectricity of UB4 was lower by three orders of magnitude than that of well-known thermoelectric material (Bi,Sb)(2)(Te, Se)(3). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Nakajima, K; Arai, Y				Nakajima, K; Arai, Y			Mass-spectrometric investigation of UO3(g)	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article								Vaporization behavior of UO3(g) over UO2+x(s) coloaded with MgO(s) was investigated by means of a quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a Knudsen-cell up to 1923 K. The ion current behavior of UO3+ and X-ray diffraction analysis of the UO2+x(s) sample after the vapor pressure measurement suggested that magnesium negligibly dissolved into UO2+x(s). The partial pressures of UO3(g) and Mg(g) were determined in a modified integral method. The partial pressure of O-2(g) was obtained indirectly from the partial pressures of UO3(g) and Mg(g). The Gibbs free energy of formation of UO3(g) was calculated from the partial pressures of UO3(g) and O-2(g) in the temperature range of 1723-1923 K, It was found that the Gibbs energy of formation of UO3(g) obtained in this study was a little higher than the recommended values recently reported.

For the two systems, a first layer of carbon contamination, followed by complex oxide layer constitutes the surface. For U, the oxide layer is composed of a mixture of UO2 and UO2+x with x maximal at the surface. In UFe2, the oxide layer is composed of a mixture of UO2 and UO2+x, oxidised iron in Fe2+ and Fe3+ chemical states (more probably FeO), a few percent of a ternary oxide UFeO4, and less than 1% of uranium carbide. A surface segregation of uranium is shown in UFe2. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In this analysis, incoming steam must diffuse into a breached rod against a counter-current flow of non-condensable fission gases and out-flowing hydrogen that is produced from the internal reaction of steam with the Zircaloy cladding or urania. A solution of the transport equations yields the local molar distribution of hydrogen and steam so that the internal oxygen potential can be estimated along the length of the gap as a function of time. These equations are numerically solved using finite-difference and control-volume methods with a sparse matrix approach. The model has been used to interpret the fission product release and fuel-rod (i.e., Zircaloy and urania) oxidation behavior observed in high-temperature annealing experiments that were conducted at the Chalk River Laboratories with spent fuel samples with Zircaloy cladding.

A clear increase in the leaching rate of the matrix and fission products with a high redox sensitivity, like technetium and molybdenum, was observed as a function of the degree of oxidation. This effect is limited to the initial step of leaching and was not observed for plutonium and for subsequent leaching periods, no relevant influence of the O/M ratio on the leaching rate could be detected. For the uranium matrix, a very low leaching rate (<3 x 10(-7) g cm(-2) d(-1)) was measured independent of the O/M ratio. In comparison to the matrix, all the fission products have higher release rates, suggesting a non-congruent leaching of elements segregated to the grain boundaries. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Raza, SS; Avila, R; Cervantes, J				Raza, SS; Avila, R; Cervantes, J			A 3-D Lagrangian (Monte carlo) method for direct plume gamma dose rate calculations	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						radiation doses; gamma dose; gamma radiation plume dose; particle model; Lagrangian model; accidental release; radiological consequences; dose rates	SIMULATION; DISPERSION; DIFFUSION	A fully 3-D Lagrangian particle method has been presented for calculating the direct gamma dose rates due to a radionuclide plume in the atmosphere. A continuous release of radionuclides into the atmosphere was simulated by liberating a large number of Lagrangian particles whose trajectories were tracked for about 25 h in a turbulent atmosphere with a known wind field. The atmosphere turbulent/stability characteristics like wind velocity fluctuations, eddy lifetime, etc., were obtained from the reported data in the published literature. For calculating the direct plume gamma dose rates a point isotropic source formula has been used with appropriate attenuation and build-up factors for the air medium. Each Lagrangian particle represented a point source of radioactivity with a known strength. The dose rates at ground due to the radionuclide cloud were calculated by adding the contribution from each Lagrangian particle in the domain. The numerically calculated dose rates were compared with the already reported results. An excellent comparison was observed for a uniform atmosphere with the Gaussian plume model predictions. However, if the wind shear (change in wind direction with height) is taken into account, we observed that for distances exceeding 20 km, the numerical data were below the reported Gaussian Plume Model (GPM) results. This indicated the need of using a modified GPM for extended distances.

Although tritiated methane was conventionally generated using a set of tritiated water vapor bubbler and an Al4C3 bed, its tritium radioactivity was limited by the saturated water vapor pressure and was dropped by a large decrease in density when water was vaporized. The present CuO-Al4C3 bed can substantially eliminate its limit because of the successive conversion from hydrogen to methane using a CuO-Al4C3 bed heated to 573 K. The difference in output between the ionization chamber and the gas chromatography was discussed based on the complete-mixing series-tank model.

Alpha-spectrometry has excellent detection limits (by mass) for all isotopes of thorium except Th-232 due to its extremely long half-life. This paper discusses improvements in the detection limit and sensitivity over previously reported methods of pre-concentration neutron activation analysis (PCNAA) For the recovery corrected, isotopic determination of thorium in various matrices. Following irradiation, the samples were dissolved, Pa-231 added as a tracer, and Pa isolated by two different methods and compared (extraction chromatography and anion exchange chromatography) followed by alpha spectrometry for recovery correction. Ion exchange chromatography was found to be superior for this application at this time, principally for reliability. The detection limit for Th-232 of 3.5.10(-7) Bq is almost three orders of magnitude lower than for alpha spectrometry using the PCRNAA method and one order of magnitude below previously reported PCNAA methods.

J	Wu, ZY; Inn, KGW; Lin, ZC; McMahon, CA				Wu, ZY; Inn, KGW; Lin, ZC; McMahon, CA			Traceability of performance evaluation materials	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								One of the most critical elements of a performance evaluation (PE) program for radioactivity measurements is the traceability of the PE materials to the national standards. The requirements and criteria for the production of traceable environmental and radiobioassay PE materials have been defined by ANSI N42.22 and ANSI N13.30 standards. It is important to note that use of traceable source materials does not necessarily ensure the traceability of subsequently derived PE materials unless verification measurements exist in conjunction with the preparation processes. This paper describes the protocol currently used by NIST for the preparation and verification of air filter, acidified water, spilled soil, synthetic urine, and synthetic fecal PE materials for low-level radioactivity measurements. The process involves gravimetric dilutions and mixing of primary radionuclide NIST Standard Reference Materials (SRMs), addition of the derived master solution to sample matrices, and subsequent verification measurements. Several gamma-emitters were used to trace the gravimetric dilutions and spike addition through an unbroken chain of gamma comparison measurements. The massic activities of alpha- and beta-emitters in the diluted solutions and PE samples were also measured by radiochemical methods and compared with their gravimetric values. A correlation analysis demonstrated that the gamma emitters quantitatively followed Sr-90, U-238, Py-238 and Am-241 throughout the dilution and spiking and can be used as effective process monitors. The statistical results from t-tests. box plots, and normal probability tests suggested that traceability of radionuclides in the PE materials to their primary standards can be verified to within 1%, with an overall precision better than 2% (1s).

J	Berne, A				Berne, A			Comparison of the uncertainties calculated for the results of radiochemical determinations using the law of propagation of uncertainty and a Monte Carlo simulation	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								Quantitative determinations of many radioactive analytes in environmental samples are based on a process in which several independent measurements of different properties are taken. The final results that are calculated using the data have to be evaluated for accuracy and precision. The estimate of the standard deviation, s, also called the combined standard uncertainty (CSU) associated with the result of this combined measurement can be used to evaluate the precision of the result. The CSU can be calculated by applying the law of propagation of uncertainty, which is based on the Taylor series expansion of the equation used to calculate the analytical result. The estimate of s can also be obtained from a Monte Carlo simulation. The data used in this simulation includes the values resulting from the individual measurements, the estimate of the variance of each value, including the type of distribution, and the equation used to calculate the analytical result. A comparison is made between these two methods of estimating the uncertainty of the calculated result.

AQCS through world-wide and regional intercomparison exercises and the provision of reference methods and reference materials (RM) have been recognized as an important component of quality assurance/quality control. A total of 43 intercomparison exercises were organized and 37 RM were produced for marine radioactivity studies. All important marine matrices were covered, e.g., seawater, marine sediments of different chemical compositions, fish, shellfish and seaplants. RM were prepared from samples collected at contaminated sites (e.g., the Irish Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Arabian Sea, Mururoa and Bikini Atolls, etc.) as well as from sites affected only by global fallout (e.g., the Pacific Ocean). Available RM are listed in the IAEA biennial catalogue and can be purchased at a minimal price. An overview of prepared RM for radionuclides in marine matrices is presented and discussed in more detail.

MA (USA) to define the characteristics of a new set of environmental radioactivity reference materials. These reference materials were to provide the radiochemist with the same analytical challenges faced when assaying environmental samples. It was decided that radionuclide bearing natural materials should be collected from sites where there had been sufficient time for natural processes to redistribute the various chemically different species of the radionuclides. Over the succeeding years, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in cooperation with other highly experienced laboratories, certified and issued a number of these as low-level radioactivity Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) for fission and activation product and actinide concentrations. The experience of certifying these SRMs has given NIST the opportunity to compare radioanalytical methods and learn of their limitations. NIST convened an international workshop in 1994 to define the natural-matrix radionuclide SRM needs for ocean studies. The highest priorities proposed at the workshop were for sediment, shellfish, seaweed, fish flesh and water matrix SRMs certified for mBq per sample concentrations of Sr-90, Cs-137 and Pu-239 + Pu-240. The most recent low-level environmental radionuclide SRM issued by NIST, Ocean Sediment (SRM 4357) has certified and uncertified values for the following 22 radionuclides: K-40 Sr-90, I-129, Cs-137, Eu-155, Pb-210, Po-210, Pb-212, Bi-214, Ra-226 Ra-228 Th-228, Th-230, Th-232, U-234, U-235, Np-237, U-238, Pu-238(,) Pu-239, + Pu-240, and Am-241. The uncertainties for a number of the certified radionuclides are non-symmetrical and relatively large because of the non-normal distribution of reported values. NIST is continuing its efforts to provide the ocean studies community with additional natural matrix radionuclide SRMs. The freeze-dried shellfish flesh matrix has been prepared and recently sent to participating laboratories for analysis and we anticipate receiving radioanalytical results in 2000. The research and development work at NIST produce well characterized SRMs that provide the world's environment-studies community with an important foundation component for radionuclide metrology.

J	Haruyama, M; Ara, K; Takase, M				Haruyama, M; Ara, K; Takase, M			High-sensitivity detection of fissile materials in a waste dram by direct interrogation of 14MeV acc neutrons	JOURNAL OF THE ATOMIC ENERGY SOCIETY OF JAPAN			Japanese	Article						TRU radioactive waste; cemented wastes; fissionable materials; active neutron assay; direct interrogation; high detection sensitivity; detection limit; 14MeV neutrons; position sensitivity difference; radiation detection; radioactive wastes; radioactive waste management; radioactive waste processing		Through the studies of active neutron method to detect fissile materials in a radioactive waste drum, the effectiveness of a new method in which 14MeV neutrons directly interrogate the waste drum was found out, and thus problems of conventional active neutron method such as its week sensitivity to the center portion of the waste drum seem to be solved. The new method is based on the moderation of 14MeV neutrons, emitted from an accelerator tube, to thermal neutrons in the matrix of waste drum itself and the detection of fast neutrons from nuclear fission induced by those thermal neutrons in the waste drum. Experiments and theoretical analyses showed capability of the new method to increase remarkably the detection sensitivity to fissile materials existing in the center portion of waste drum. Namely, the order of detection sensitivity difference over 100 times along the radial direction in the waste drum with the conventional method can be decreased to about +/-18% with the new method. The difference in the whole drum body is only about +/-22%, and Pu of 30mg in the center portion of drum can be detected and the detection limitation level is 4-5mg. Because all those data were obtained with a measurement setup that was designed for the study with conventional active neutron method, one could obtain more better results with an optimum measurement setup suited to the new method.

BOREXINO is a low-background detector to study the sub-MeV solar neutrino events (mainly Be-7) making use of a well-shielded ultrapure scintillator. The scintillation reaction that follows the scattering of the neutrinos on the electrons in the liquid is captured by 2200 phototubes which surround the 300 t of scintillator. The main difficulty of the experimental apparatus consists in the ultra-low radioactive background required for all the materials involved in the construction. Moreover, extremely strict cleanliness standards are mandatory for the operating conditions in order to avoid any further contamination coming from outside. The multi-shell structure of BOREXINO will avoid any cont amination of the inner core of the liquid scintillator, perfectly suitable to carry out the challenging task of low-energy neutrino detection.

This device, with a 200 mum thick pixel matrix (64 x 63 square pixels, 170 mum side), has already been tested with very good results for digital mammography applications (mean energy 20 keV). For more energetic photons, as in nuclear medicine, a 600 mum thick detector has been chosen. Using radioactive sources (Am-241, 60 keV and Tc-99m, 140 keV photons) we have measured the performance of our pr otatype in terms of charge collection and detection efficiency of the detector, discrimination capability of the electronics and imaging properties of the whole system. In particular, we have evaluated the spatial resolution properties measuring the Point Spread Function and the imaging capabilities using a home made thyroid phantom. We present also the comparison between these results and those obtained with a traditional gamma camera and the evaluation, made by both experimental measurements and software simulations, of the geometry related to the use of a collimator.

In large devices for energy production like a fission reactor, the future proposed Energy Amplifier or a Fusion power plant, this energy release represents a source of heat, which although at a very much lower level than the heating during operations is of the order of MWs for large nuclear power plants. Accurate estimation of the decay power is essential for safety analyses of the power plant against loss of coolant accidents, etc. Some computer codes have been developed to predict the decay power, but validation of the computer codes through experimental measurements is essential. A new large, almost 4 pi detector, formed by coupling a well-type CsI scintillator and a small plastic beta detector has been developed for accurate and efficient measurements of decay power from gamma and beta radiation. preliminary measurements of decay power produced in neutron-activated tungsten are presented and compared with the predictions of the European Activation Code System, EASY-99.

However. there exists geological evidence suggesting that carbonaceous materials can be transformed to diamond by irradiation at substantially lower temperatures. For example, submicronsize diamond aggregates have been found in uranium-rich, Precambrian carbonaceous deposits that never experienced high temperature or pressure. To test if diamonds can be formed at lower irradiation temperatures. sheets of fine-grain polycrystalline graphite were bombarded at 20 degreesC with 350 +/- 50 MeV Kr ions to fluences of 6 x 10(12) cm(-2) using the Argonne tandem linear accelerator system (ATLAS). Ion-irradiated land unirradiated control) graphite specimens were then subjected to acid dissolution treatments to remove untransformed graphite and isolate diamonds that were produced; these acid residues were subsequently characterized by high-resolution and analytical electron microscopy. The acid residue of the ion-irradiated graphite was found to contain nanodiamonds, demonstrating that ion irradiation of graphite at ambient temperature can produce diamond. The diamond yield under our irradiation conditions is low, similar to0.01 diamonds/ion. An important observation that emerges from comparing the present result with previous observations of diamond formation during irradiation is that nanodiamonds form under a surprisingly R ide range of irradiation conditions. This propensity may be related to the very small difference in the graphite and diamond free-energies coupled with surface-energy considerations that may alter the relative stability of diamond and graphite at nanometer sizes.

Though such defects have been tentatively identified as In-vacancy (In-V) and In-interstitial (In-I) configurations, an unambiguous assignment is still lacking and conflicting interpretations are apparent. For the present report, a series of experiments have been performed as functions of ion dose, background dopant and dopant concentration to examine both the validity of previous suppositions and produce supplementary evidence to aid in determining the microscopic nature of the two defective configurations. The relative fractions of the defective configurations were generally insensitive to dopant concentration and thus did not exhibit a significant Fermi level dependence. The present results suggest that the formation of an In-V complex is not the result of elastic interaction between an In-acceptor and neutral vacancy. Alternative interpretations are discussed.

Two fit formulas are presented for mean equilibrium charge states of projectiles ranging from protons to uranium. One formula is given for all ions in gas targets and another one for solid targets. The deviation from the experimental data is reduced by roughly a factor of two in comparison with the widely used formula by Nikolaev and Dmitriev as well as with the Bohr stripping criterion as revised by Northcliffe. Finally, the influence of the projectile charge state on the prediction of stopping powers for fast projectiles in carbon is shown and comparison is made with experimental energy-loss data.

The V-grooves were formed by anisotropic etching and subsequent oxidation of their surface. The implantation of 1 x 10(17) Ge+ cm(-2) at 70 keV into the oxide layer leads to an enrichment of Ge in the V-groove bottom. In this Ge-rich bottom region, subsequent annealing in N-2 atmosphere results in the formation of a nanowire by coalescence of Ge precipitates. Scanning transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray analysis (STEM-EDX) investigations of as-implanted samples have confirmed the Ge accumulation at the V-groove bottom, whereas cross-sectional TEM studies of annealed samples prove the formation of a Ge nanowire. The formation mechanisms were studied theoretically by means of a continuum description of sputtering and kinetic 3D lattice Monte-Carlo simulations of phase separation. The preliminary results indicate the possibility of achieving nanowires being several nanometers wide by further growth optimizations. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The radiation damage was estimated using Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in channelling geometry (RBS-c), while trapping and release processes were followed using the D(He-3,p)alpha nuclear reaction. The measured radiation damage is larger than TRIM.SP predictions in both materials. Deuterium-induced damage at low fluences shows similar annealing behaviour in HOPG and in diamond. Implanted deuterium shows similar trapping behaviour in HOPG and diamond, while the thermal release shows two regimes: at high fluences the release behaviour is similar in both materials, at low fluences only little deuterium is released from diamond up to 1100 K.

A new method has been developed based on the calculation of the self-absorption and transmission coefficients of the gamma photons emitted by the uranium or thorium families and by the potassium 40 (K-40) isotope for evaluating the gamma dose rate in the samples. Moreover, the transport of gamma photons across parallelepipedic blocks of the geological materials was investigated. Using the results of these studies, the gamma dose rates in the atmosphere of different geological deposits were evaluated. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The colour of the lead-alkali-silicate glass turned to brownish orange with absorbed dose. Radiation-induced changes in the properties of visible light transmittance and absorbance were examined between wavelengths of 380 and 1500 nm using a spectrophotometer. Changes in the optical colour parameters were determined and compared with those of unexposed glasses and it is shown that they can be used as radiation dosimeters, especially for medical dosimeters.

Gaseous mixtures of hydrogen (H-2) and deuterium (D-2) have been frozen onto a thin 60-mm diameter silver foil, and then irradiated with charged particles of energies up to 33 keV/q. Already, solid films of H-2 and D-2 mixtures with implanted helium ions have been successfully used in muon catalyzed fusion related experiments at RIKEN-RAL Muon Facility. This new method allows studies of the nuclear charge distribution of unstable atoms by means of the muonic X-ray method at facilities where both negative muon and radioactive nuclear beams would be available.

The possible use of such detectors in nuclear medicine implies detection of more energetic photons, up to the 140 keV of the Tc-99m source; thus efficient detectors must be thicker than those previously studied. In this paper, we present the results of the investigation of electrical and detection properties (spectra, c.c.e., energy resolution) of a series of detectors, whose thickness ranges from 200 to 1000 mum, when irradiated with radioactive sources over the energy range used in nuclear medicine.

This system is under industrial development and commercialisation by the firm EURISYS Mesures. The most specific characteristics of CARTOGAM lie in its size (8 cm in diameter) and mass (15 kg for the detection head, including the shield), which make it portable by a person. As an example, CARTOGAM detects a 660 keV source producing a 0.4 mu Gy/h dose rate at the camera location in 10 min. The angular resolution at that energy ranges from 1 degrees to 3 degrees, depending on the field of view (30 degrees or 50 degrees) and scintillator thickness (2 or 4 mm). We present here a review of the specifications of the camera and show a few images illustrating its performance. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Since the effective delayed neutron fraction beta (eff) and the mean neutron lifetime l are two important parameters in the characterisation of the dynamic behaviour of a reactor, an absolute measurement of these parameters is necessary to assure the correct validation of neutron transport codes. To meet this requirement, the RAPJA-technique was used. The RAPJA technique combines a Prompt Jump With a Rossi-Alpha measurement at the stationary subcritical level associated with the antireactivity level obtained after the Prompt Jump. The obtained results are well in accordance with calculated values for MOX-cores at VENUS. The measurements also show that uncertainties of 3 and 1.5% on respectively beta (eff) and l are achievable on a core loaded with weapon-grade plutonium. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In addition, the pool is designed to accommodate spent fuel of MTR type as well. Criticality safety of this pool for the different fuel types has been evaluated as a Function of U-235 loading. The effect of fuel clement separation (rows and columns) on the eigenvalue has been studied. As a conservative assumption, the pool is assumed to be filled with fresh fuel. The eigenvalue considering a realistic degree of fuel burn-up was determined in order to determine the safety margin. The calculations have been carried out using the code packages of the National Center for Nuclear Safety and Radiation Control. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The processing and stockpiling of amang and ilmenite in open-air spaces, subject as it is to environmental influences, gives rise to a potential for affecting residents in adjacent area. A case study was carried out in a residential area neighbouring a typical amang plant to investigate the radiological impact to the residents. The average Effective Dose rates, calculated based on the contributions of Effective Dose rates from inhaled suspended radioactive dust, radon-thoron and their progeny, and external gamma radiation, were determined for selected houses. Results show that the occupants of those houses received Effective Dose rate, which cannot be differentiated from background. The major contributor to the average Effective Dose rate came from external radiation sources. Inhaled radon and its progeny was the second major contributor. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Development of new radiopharmaceuticals based on Re-188 depends on the radiolabeling methods used, which would give stable complexes having predefined radiochemical properties and in vitro and in vivo stability. This paper has attempted to provide a perspective of Re-188-labeled monoclonal antibodies, their radiolabeling characteristics, methods for quality control of radioimmunoconjugates and in vitro stability for radioimmunotherapy of solid tumors. The direct method of Re-188 radiolabeling of antibodies by reductive attachment of Re-188 in which free sulfhydryl groups have been generated by reduction of the intramolecular S-S disulfide bonds has been shown to be a promising approach in particular. Moreover, excellent methods have been developed to test the radionuclide, radiochemical purity and stability of Re-188-radioimmunoconjugates using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and paper chromatography.

It is based either on the analyses of the growth curves of the radon in the air volume surrounding a sample enclosed in an accumulation chamber (Lucas cell or RADIM device) or using the charcoal adsorption method. Samples used have a special geometry allowing the assumption of a one-dimensional diffusion of radon in material. Radium was enhanced in the concrete samples by adding radium bromide solution or uranium ore. A strong dependence of the emanation fraction on the enhancing method was observed. For the sample enhanced with uranium ore the specific exhalation rate was about ten times smaller. A marked dependence of radon exhalation on the water content was also observed.
