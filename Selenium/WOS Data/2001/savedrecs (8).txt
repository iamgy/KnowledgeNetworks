It was in the range of 0-6.13 mug/l in the phosphate areas. and lower than I ppb in the volcanic areas. The activity ratio of U-234/U-238 was investigated, and disequilibrium of uranium isotopes was found to occur (U-234/U-238 = 0.52-2.02). The excess of U-234 was calculated. This excess can be interpreted by higher mobility of U-234, which more readily forms the soluble (UO2)(2+) ion in comparison with U-238. most of which remains in the insoluble 4(+) state. This excess increases with increase in uranium concentration. Thorium concentration was measured using INAA, it was found to be in the rang 0-1.15 mug/l. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

These sources were surrounded with cement of different thickness (1, 2 and 4 cm). The release of radon from these sources (before and after being surrounded) was studied. The results showed that radon release from the sources itself was less then its release from the same source after bring surrounded by cement, and the release did not change with the thickness of cement. Samples were covered with a thin layer of polyethylene before being surrounded with cement. It was found that this additional layer reduced the radon exhalation. This thin layer stopped any reaction between the source and the surrounding cement during solidification of the cement layers. These reactions are thought to be the reason for the increase of radon exhalation from the sources surrounded by cement. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although, a great deal of work has been done in the field of radiation protection and remedial action on uranium and other mines, recent concern has been devoted to the hazard arising from naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) in oil and gas facilities. NORM wastes associated with oil and gas operations from scale deposits, separated sludge and water at different oil fields in the eastern acid western deserts were investigated. Concentrations of the uranium, thorium, and potassium (K-40) series have been determined from high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometry. Total uranium content of samples was determined using laser fluorimetry. The levels of radioactivity were mainly due to enhanced levels of dissolved radium ions. Only minute quantities of uranium and thorium were present. The disequilibrium factor for U-238/Ra-226 has been determined. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

A multilinear cryogenic cylindrical target, 1 cm long, 0.44 cm in radius, and containing similar to7.8 mg equimolar DT fuel, is studied as an example. The driver-accelerator gives two different target irradiation regimes. In both regimes, the beams consist of platinum ions, accelerated up to 100 GeV with different isotopic composition, charged in the first regime only positively and in the second regime positively and negatively. In the first regime, the beam energy is 4.8 MJ and the beam heats in 60 nsec only the target shell. High heating symmetry is achieved by rapidly rotating the beam around the target axis with frequency similar to1 GHz. The fuel is compressed into a dense filament, where the condition for propagation of a fusion burn wave is satisfied -rhoR greater than or equal to 0.4 g/cm(2). In the second regime, a beam with 0.4 MJ ions heats in 0.2 nsec compressed fuel with power density 2.5(.)10(7) TW/cm(2) up to ignition temperature. The computed energy amplification factor in the target is greater than or equal to200.

J	Kisev, GV				Kisev, GV			Possibilities for improving electronuclear systems	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								Conceptual investigations, performed in the last few years by Russian specialists, of various variants of electronuclear systems have stimulated novel scientific-technical ideas for improving such systems in order to annihilate long-lived components of radioactive wastes efficiently. These suggestions are reviewed not only from the standpoint of priority but also to understand their usefulness in the development of future designs. The possibility of using sectioned blankets with a composite neutron valve is interesting; this makes it possible in principle to decrease the proton accelerator current. The technological scheme with an indication of the problems is briefly described at the beginning of the paper.								ADAMOV OE, 1997, ATOM ENERG, V83, P133; Alekseev P.

The subprojects covered in the article, referred to as LOT 1-3, are called Industrial Complex for Solid Radwaste Management (ICSRM). They comprise facilities for the retrieval and treatment of solid radioactive waste and the construction of a store for shortlived waste. The three international companies participating, i.e. BNFL, NUKEM, and INITEC, began to work on the project in March 2000; turnkey delivery is scheduled for April 2004. LOT 1 encompasses the construction of a facility for retrieval and treatment of approx. 2 450 m(3) of low and medium level waste from the XTO interim storage facility on the Chernobyl site. This waste mainly includes protective clothing, metal parts, building components, and graphite. The facility to be built within LOT 2 will be used to treat all categories of low and medium level solid waste. It is to allow solid waste to be separated, treated further, compacted if necessary, and packaged in containers as a function of its activity and physical quality. LOT 3 comprises the construction of a shallow land burial repository for the emplacement of solid, conditioned low and medium level waste materials arising from the ICSRM project. It is based on the concept of a similar facility at El Cabril, Spain, and will be erected roughly 10 km from the Chernobyl power plant site. The repository 3 will have a capacity of 63 200 m(3) and will ensure safe containment of waste packages for a storage period of 300 years.

Two important back-end fuel cycle projects were completed in 2000 for spent fuel management of the two nuclear power plants of Bohunice and Mochovce run by the Slovak power company, Slovenske Elektrarne: construction of a waste management center for low and medium level waste at Jaslovske Bohunice, and construction of a shallow land burial repository for conditioned waste at Mochovce. The waste management center (BSC RAG) is equipped with a variety of installations for compacting, concentrating, incinerating, and conditioning radioactive waste from the Slovak nuclear power plants and from other institutions. Initial planning of BSC RAO started in 1993. In the spring of 2000, the Slovak licensing authority, UJD, issued the permit for trial operation. After successful completion of that phase in the spring of 2001, the license for continuous operation was granted. In the meantime, the first packages fit for permanent storage were shipped to the repository in containers and emplaced in the storage caverns.

Both systems use the same blanket concept, but tritium breeding is taken into account for the fusion system. The ATW and fusion plants are found to have the same electrical energy requirement per available blanket neutron when the blanket coverage is comparable and the fusion energy gain is near breakeven (Q approximate to 1), but the fusion plant has only a fraction of the energy requirement when Q much greater than 1. If the blanket thermal energy is converted to electricity, the fusion plant and ATW have comparable net electricity energy outputs per available neutron when Q greater than or equal to 1.5 and the blanket neutron multiplication is large.

J	Dufour, J; Murat, D; Dufour, X; Foos, J				Dufour, J; Murat, D; Dufour, X; Foos, J			Experimental observation of nuclear reactions in palladium and uranium - Possible explanation by hydrex mode	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						low-energy nuclear reactions; metallic hydrides; fission reactions	ENERGY	Experiments with uranium are presented that show a highly exothermal reaction, which can only be of nuclear origin. One striking point of these results is that they clearly show that what is being observed is not some kind effusion reaction of the deuterium present (only exceedingly small amounts of it are present). This is a strong indication that hydrogen can trigger nuclear reactions that seem to involve the nuclei of the lattice (which would yield a fission-like pattern of products). Confronted with a situation where some experiments in the field yield a fusion-like pattern of products (CF experiments) and others a fissionlike one (LENR experiments), one can reasonably wonder whether one is not observing two aspects of the same phenomenon. Thus, it is proposed to describe CF and LENR reactions as essentially the same phenomenon based on the possible existence of a still hypothetical proton/electron resonance, which would catalyze fissionlike reactions with a neutron sink.(1) Finally, a series of experiments is proposed to assess this hypothesis.

Patient-specific parameters include the individual thyroidal uptake, the patient's physical dimensions, attenuation of radiation by body tissues, buildup of secondary photons, whole body and thyroid retention functions as well as the distance and time the patient is around others. This paper also demonstrates how to calculate an inpatient's discharge time, so that the patient will not expose other individuals above the desired total dose equivalent set by the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO).

J	Strom, DJ; MacLellan, JA				Strom, DJ; MacLellan, JA			Evaluation of eight decision rules for low-level radioactivity counting	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						statistics; radioactivity; bioassay; dosimetry; internal		In low-level radioactivity measurements, it is often important to decide whether a measurement differs from background. A traditional formula for decision level (DL) is given in numerous sources, including the recent ANSI/HPS N13.30-1996, Performance Criteria for Radiobioassay and the Multi-Agency Radiation Survey and Site investigation Manual (MARSSIM), This formula, which we dub the N13.30 rule, does not adequately account for the discrete nature of the Poisson distribution for paired blank (equal count times for background and sample) measurements, especially at low numbers of counts, We calculate the actual false positive rates that occur using the N13.30 DL formula as a function of a priori false positive rate alpha and background Poisson mean mu = rhot, where rho is the underlying Poisson rate and t is the counting time, False positive rates exceed alpha by significant amounts for alpha less than or equal to 0.2 and mu < 100 counts, peaking at 25% at mu congruent to 0.71, nearly independent of alpha. Monte Carlo simulations verified calculations. Currie's derivation of the N13.30 DL was based on knowing a good estimate of the mean and standard deviation of background, a case that does not hold for paired blanks and low background rates. We propose one new decision rule (simply add I to the number of background counts), and we present six additional decision rules from various sources, We evaluate the actual false positive rate for all eight decision rules as a function of a priori false positive rate and background mean, All of the seven alternative rules perform better than the N13.30 rule. Each has advantages and drawbacks. Given these results, we believe that many regulations, national standards, guidance documents, and texts should be corrected or modified to use a better decision rule.

This recommendation was determined, in part, by regressing the diameter of the scabs induced by fissioned (UC2)-U-235 hot particles as a function of the logarithm of the number of beta particles emitted from the sources for one study. To validate this recommendation and the approach used by the NCRP, external irradiations of pig skin using radioactive sources of less than 600 mum in the largest dimension were carried out. The hot particles used included fissioned (UC2)-U-235 and activated Tm-170, Yb-175, and Sc-46. Results indicated a strong correlation between scab diameter and dose for scabs induced using fissioned (UC2)-U-235, activated Tm-170, and Sc-46, but not for Yb-175. The correlation value decreased with decreasing beta particle energy, with the exception of Sc-46, which had scabs with diameters greater than twice the maximum beta particle range, The larger scabs from Sc-46 are thought to be due to dose contributions from the gamma rays. The results also give an ulceration threshold less than that given by NCRP to prevent acute deep ulceration. It was concluded that regression analysis of scab diameter as a function of either number of beta particles emitted from the hot particles or dose did not yield either precise or accurate thresholds but was useful in determining probable ranges of doses which lead to scab induction.

The objective of the study was to determine a threshold for scab induction. Hot particles used included fissioned U-235 and activated Tm-170, Yb-175, and Sc-46 with maximum beta-particle energies of similar to1.8 (average), 0.97, 0.47, and 0.35 MeV, respectively. The photon emissions from the fissioned U-235 were about 1 MeV per disintegration. The photon emissions from Sc-46 were 0.89 and 1.12 MeV, with 100% abundance. Photon emissions from Tm-170 and Yb-175 were negligible. Responses followed cumulative normal probability distributions; thus, no true thresholds could be determined. Hence, 10% and 50% scab incidence rates (ED10 and ED50, respectively) were determined using probit analysis. For dose averaged over 1 cm(2) at a depth of 70 mum, the ED10 (and 95% confidence limits) were 5.1 (2.7-7.2) Gy for Sc-46, 1.3 (0.89-1.8) Gy for Yb-175, 2.8 (1.9-3.5) Gy for Tm-170, 8.5 (5.7-9.8) Gy for on-skin fissioned UC2, and 4.5 (0.9-7.2) GS for off-skin fissioned UC2. The ED50 values were 12 (8.8-17) Gy for Sc-46, 6.0 (4.3-9.7) Gy for Yb-175, 5.9 (5.1-6.7) Gy for Tm-170, 11 (9.9-19) Gy for on-skin fissioned (UC2)-U-235, and 11 (6.2-14) Gy for off-skin fissioned (UC2)-U-235.

J	Marley, F				Marley, F			Investigation of the air pressure characteristics influencing the variability of radon gas and radon progeny in domestic vernacular buildings	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						radon progeny; geology; modeling; meteorological; radioactivity; indoor	TRANSPORT	Analysis of time-series data sets collected in vernacular buildings linked with radium source bedrock has identified a number of internal and external pressure characteristics linking meteorological parameters with the variability of radon gas and its progeny. The buildings' cellars built into the bedrock associated with the radium source have relatively high levels of radon concentration. These cellars have essentially stable microclimatic conditions, unlike the ground and upper levels of the buildings. Comparative radon concentration data collected from various comparable buildings suggest the need to distinguish between short and longer-term influences on radon concentrations. Water vapor pressure is inferred to be a principal determinant of the short-term variability of radon gas concentrations. Barometric pressure is suggested as determining the trend or general longer-term Level of radon. Both of these pressure components are related to temperature. Wind speed appears to have a dual influence on radon variability: directly, through wind pressure relative to the ground and building structure particularly associated with low-pressure weather regimes; and indirectly, through changes to the water vapor pressure component.

This paper sets out to investigate urine analysis as a suitable monitoring approach for workers potentially exposed to thorium, Due to its biokinetic behavior and its low solubility, urinary concentrations are generally very low, requiring therefore high sensitivity analytical methods. An analytical procedure has been developed for detecting Th-232 concentrations of below 1 mBq L-1 quickly and easily. Due to the long half-life (1.41 x 10(10) y) of Th-232, the potential of a procedure based on urine sample dilution and ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry) measurement was investigated first. Two dilution factors were chosen: 100, which is more suitable for long-term measurement trials, and 20, which increases sensitivity. It has been shown that a 100-fold dilution can be used to measure concentrations of below 1 mBq L-1, whereas a 20-fold one ran be used to reach concentrations of below 0.06 mBq L-1. Then, on the basis of the limitation of the procedure based on urine dilution, the suitable field of application for the different procedures (100-fold and 20-fold dilution and also a chemical purification followed by an ICP-MS measurement) was determined in relation to monitoring objectives.

Materials and methods: Chromosome translocation frequencies were evaluated by scoring 933 3077 metaphases under fluorescence microscope for each of the five male and four female exposed individuals after they had relocated from the radioactive environment for 34 and 82 months. FISH painting was conducted using kits of whole-chromosome probes for chromosomes 1, 2 and 4 in orange and 3, 5 and 6 in green and counter-stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The retrospective dose estimation termed Taiwan Cumulative Dose (TCD) was conducted by assessment using detailed information of historical exposure and the environmental radioactivity for each apartment during previous residency. Results: A total of 20 244 well-prepared metaphases were scored. Biodoses were calculated from the translocation frequencies and physical doses were estimated from detail questionnaires for each individual. The translocation frequencies measured ranged from 2.2 x 10(-3) to 26.8 x 10(-)3 translocations per cell and the dose equivalent from 52.2 to 992.2 mSv. A good correlation was observed between the physical and biodoses. A plot of TCD against FISH-derived doses produced D-fish = 0.65 D-rCD, when fitted by a linear model, and D-fish = 0.53 D-rCD + 1.26 x 10(-4) D-TCD(2), when fitted with a linear quadratic model. Given the scatter in the data and the extremely small quadratic dose contribution, neither model could be ruled out. Conclusion: Chromosome translocations provide a valid method of dose estimation in extremely protracted low dose-rate gamma -radiation exposure. Validation of the TCD method by FISH-measured translocations supports the use of TCD for epidemiological studies.

Materials and methods: CBA/H mice were exposed to a single dose of X-rays (0.5 Gy) on either day 7 or day 14 of pregnancy or given Pu-239 (100 kBq kg(-1)) by intraperitoneal injection on either day 6 or day 13. Tritium was administered to mice throughout pregnancy as either tritiated water, ad libitum in drinking ater (total intake averaged 130 MBq), or as homogenized tritiated cress, administered by gastric intubation (total 60 MBq). Irradiated and unexposed control mice and their offspring were sacrificed at 2-8 weeks after birth. Direct metaphase preparations from femoral bone marrow cells from mothers and offspring were used for G-band analysis. Results: The incidence of stable aberrations was significantly and similarly increased in neonatal and maternal marrow samples after exposure to X-rays, 239Pu or H-3. The estimated average bone absorbed doses from 239Pu in pregnant females were similar to the X-ray dose of 0.5 Gy, suggesting a low RBE for alpha -irradiation in adults. The similar levels of damage observed in neonates after X-irradiation and Pu-239 exposure are indicative of greater in utero sensitivity to alpha -irradiation since the overall estimated in utero alpha -particle doses to haemopoietic tissue were much lower. In utero doses from H-3 and corresponding maternal doses were around 0.5 Gy, showing no evidence of greater in utero sensitivity, no significant difference between the effects of the two forms of tritium, and were consistent with an RBE value of 1-2. Conclusions: Comparison of stable aberration yields in haemopoetic cells suggests a greater sensitivity to alpha -particles from Pu-239 than X-rays or beta -particles from H-3 for irradiation in utero but a low RBE value in adults.

It has been pointed out by the present authors that it is essential to understand such mass transfer steps as diffusion of tritium in the grain of breeder material, absorption of water vapor into bulk of the grain, and adsorption of water on surface of the grain, together with two types of isotope exchange reactions for estimation of the tritium inventory in a uniform solid breeder blanket under the steady-state condition. The adsorption capacity and the isotope exchange capacity on the Li2TiO3 surface are experimentally obtained in this study. Comparison of the tritium inventory estimated for the Li2TiO3 blanket with the inventory for LiAlO2, Li2ZrO3 or Li4SiO4 blanket using the model presented by the present authors shows that the Li2TiO3 blanket gives the smallest tritium inventory among the candidate ceramic breeding materials.

The general method for deducing CDTT for a given material under the prevailing conditions of sintering and the likely variables that influence the CDTT are described. Though the present work is specific in nature for uranium dioxide sintering in argon atmosphere, the concept of CDTT is fairly general and must be applicable to sintering of any material and has immense potential to offer advantages in designing and/or optimizing the profile of a sintering furnace, in the diagnosis of the fault in the process conditions of sintering, and so on. The problems of viewing the effect of heating rate only in terms of densification are brought out in the light of observing the undesirable phenomena of coring and bloating and causes were identified and remedial measures suggested.

For SWV curves for plutonium, the concentration dependence of the peak current was not linear at high concentration. However, the limiting currents for uranium and plutonium determined by NPV were proportional to their concentrations up to about 1.7 wt%. The fission product elements do not seem to affect the accuracy in determination of actinide concentrations because the limiting currents for uranium and plutonium were not influenced by the addition of gadolinium. It was found to be difficult to determine neptunium concentration in the presence of plutonium due to the overlap of the output current waves. From those results, NPV was considered more promising although the optimization of applied potential waveform is necessary for use at higher concentrations. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Choo, KN; Kim, YS				Choo, KN; Kim, YS			Hydrogen uptake and corrosion behavior of Zr-2.5Nb pressure tubes in Wolsong Unit 1	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							HEAT-TREATMENT; NB ALLOYS; OXIDATION	The hydrogen uptake behavior of Zr-2.5Nb pressure tubes in Wolsong Unit 1 was analyzed in terms of reactor operating factors including the longitudinal location, coolant temperature and time, and compared with those obtained from other CANDU reactors. The amount of deuterium uptake was higher at the outlet of the pressure tubes which were subjected to a higher coolant temperature and became enhanced with increasing reactor operation time. The Zr-2.5Nb pressure tubes in Wolsong Unit 1 showed stable hydrogen uptake behavior up to 13 effective full power years (EFPY). However, scattering of the deuterium uptake tends to increase with increasing operation time. Furthermore, the hydrogen charged Zr-2.5Nb specimens were subjected to corrosion at 400 degreesC under 10 MPa H2O with an aim of evaluating the effect of absorbed hydrogen on the corrosion of pressure tubes in the later stage of life. The absorbed hydrogen seems to have a negligible effect on the corrosion behavior of Zr-2.5Nb pressure tubes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

These uranium titanates were subjected to 800 keV Kr2+ irradiation from 30 to 973 K. The critical amorphization dose of the U-rich and Nb-rich titanates at room temperature were 4.72 x 10(17) and 5 x 10(17) ions/m', respectively. At elevated temperature, the critical amorphization dose increases due to dynamic thermal annealing. The critical amorphization temperature for both Nb-rich and U-rich titanates is similar to 933 K under a 800 keV Kr2+ irradiation. Above the critical amorphization temperature, nanocrystals with an average size of similar to 15 nm were observed. The formation of nanocrystals is due to epitaxial recrystallization. At higher temperatures, an ion irradiation-induced nucleation-growth mechanism also contributes to the formation of nanocrystals. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Electrical resistivity, volume expansion (density), enthalpy, sound velocity, and equation of state parameters (bulk modulus, adiabatic and thermal compressibility, Gruneisen parameter, and the specific heat ratio) have been measured and extended in the whole liquid region up to nearly 4000 K, and are reported in this paper. Among numerous anomalies of Pu, the literature data have revealed that liquid Pu shows an atypical behavior by presenting a positive temperature coefficient for sound velocity up to 1225 K. We have confirmed such a behavior but also reported a drastic change of sound velocity at around 2000 K. Such results are interpreted in terms of the delocalization of the 5f electrons in liquid Pu.

Improved estimates of these cross-sections were derived from a series of irradiations that were conducted at relatively low temperatures (< 100 degreesC) in the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) as part of the test program supporting the Accelerator Production of Tritium (APT) Program. In this irradiation campaign, a variety of candidate structural alloys and pure metal dosimeter foils were irradiated in various particle spectra, ranging from 800 MeV protons, to mixed energy distributions of both protons and spallation neutrons, and finally to distributions consisting primarily of high energy neutrons. At proton energies on the order of hundreds of MeV, exceptionally high levels of gas atoms are generated in all elemental constituents of typical iron-based and nickel-based structural alloys, with helium typically on the order of similar to 150 appm per dpa. and hydrogen at approximately a factor of 3-5 higher. Most of the gas production is due to proton and helium recoils from the proton beam interactions with the specimens, although gas and especially damage production from lower-energy spallation neutrons becomes increasingly significant at locations farther from the beam center. The results show that helium production rate per dpa by protons in elements typically found in structural alloys is relatively insensitive to elemental composition. The measured helium concentrations and the derived cross-sections are larger by about a factor of two, however, than those calculated using the LAHET code which was optimized for prediction of neutron/proton ratios in the target tungsten source rods of the APT test, Unlike helium, the retained hydrogen levels are somewhat sensitive to composition, reflecting primarily different levels of diffusional loss, but hydrogen is still retained at rather high concentrations, allowing a lower bound estimate of the hydrogen generation rates.

Austenitic stainless steels 316 L and 304 L are two of these candidate alloys possessing attractive strength and corrosion resistance for APT applications. This paper describes the dose dependence of the irradiation-induced microstructural evolution of SS 316 L and 304 L in the temperature range 30-60 degreesC and consequent changes in mechanical properties. It was observed that the microstructural evolution during irradiation was essentially identical in the two alloys, a behavior mirrored in their changes in mechanical properties. With one expection, it was possible to correlate all changes in mechanical properties with visible microstructural. features. A late-term second abrupt decrease in uniform elongation was not associated with visible microstructure, but is postulated to be a consequence of large levels of retained hydrogen measured in the specimens. In spite of large amounts of both helium and hydrogen retained, approaching I at.% at the highest exposures, no visible cavities were formed, indicating that the gas atoms were either in solution or in subresolvable clusters.

The neutrons are multiplied and moderated in a lead/aluminum/water blanket and then captured in He-3 to form tritium. The materials in the target and blanket region are exposed to protons and neutrons with energies into the GeV range. The effect of irradiation on the tensile and fracture toughness properties of candidate APT materials, 316L and 304L stainless steel (annealed), modified (Mod) 9Cr-1Mo steel, and Alloy 718 (precipitation hardened), was measured on tensile and fracture toughness specimens irradiated at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center accelerator, which operates at an energy of 800 MeV and a current of I mA. The irradiation temperatures ranged from 50 degreesC to 164 degreesC, prototypic of those expected in the APT target/blanket. The maximum achieved proton fluence was 4.5 x 10(21) p/cm(2) for the materials in the center of the beam. This maximum exposure translates to a dpa of 12 and the generation of 10000 appm H and 1000 appm He for the Type 304L stainless steel tensile specimens. Specimens were tested at the irradiation temperature of 50-164 degreesC. Less than I dpa of exposure reduced the uniform elongation of the Alloy 718 (precipitation hardened) and Mod 9Cr-1Mo to less than 2%. This same dose reduced the fracture toughness by 50%. Approximately 4 dpa of exposure was required to reduce the uniform elongation of the austenitic stainless steels (304L and 316L) to less than 2%. The yield stress of the austenitic steels increased to more than twice its non-irradiated value after less than I dpa. The fracture toughness reduced significantly by 4 dpa to similar to 100 MPa m(1/2). These results are discussed and compared with results of similar materials irradiated in fission reactor environments. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This alloy is a candidate material for use in accelerator production of tritium (APT) target and blanket applications, where it would have to withstand low-temperature irradiation by high-energy protons and spallation neutrons. The existing data base, relevant to such irradiation conditions, is very limited. Alloy 718 has therefore been exposed to a particle flux and spectrum at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE), closely matching those expected in the A-PT target and blanket applications. The yield stress of Alloy 718 increases with increasing dose up to similar to0.5 dpa, and then decreases with further increase in dose. The uniform elongation, however, drastically decreases with increasing dose at very low doses (<0.5 dpa), and does not recover when the alloy later softens somewhat. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigation of Alloy 718 shows that superlattice spots corresponding to the age-hardening precipitate phases gamma ' and gamma " are lost from the diffraction patterns for Alloy 718 by only 0.6 dpa, the lowest proton-induced dose level achieved in this experiment. Examination of samples that were neutron irradiated to doses of only similar to0.1 dpa showed that precipitates are faintly visible in diffraction patterns but are rapidly becoming invisible. It is proposed that the gamma ' and gamma " first become disordered (by <0.6 dpa), but remain as solute-rich aggregates that still contribute to the hardness at relatively low dpa levels, and then are gradually dispersed at higher doses.

J	Crespo, LS; Munoz, FJM; Briceno, DG				Crespo, LS; Munoz, FJM; Briceno, DG			Short-term static corrosion tests in lead-bismuth	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Workshop on Spallation Matereials Technology (IWSMT-4)	OCT 08-13, 2000	SCHRUNS, AUSTRIA	Forschungszentrum Julich, Los Alamos Natl Lab, Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Paul Scherrer Inst				Martensitic steels have been proposed to be used as structural materials and as spallation target window in hybrid systems devoted to the transmutation of radioactive waste of long life and high activity. However, their compatibility with lead-bismuth in the operating conditions of these systems depends on the existence of a protective layer such as an oxide film. The feasibility of forming and maintaining an oxide layer or maintaining a pre-oxidised one has been studied. Martensitic steel F82Hmod. (8% Cr) has been tested in lead-bismuth under static and isothermal conditions at 400 degreesC and 600 degreesC. In order to study the first stages of the interaction between the steel and the eutectic, short-term tests (100 and 665 h) have been carried out. Pre-oxidised and as-received samples have been tested in atmospheres with different oxidant potential. For low oxygen concentration in lead-bismuth due to unexpected oxygen consumption in the experimental device, dissolution of as-received F82Hmod. occurs and pre-oxidation does not prevent the material dissolution. For high oxygen concentration, the pre-oxidation layer seems to improve the feasibility of protecting stainless steels controlling the oxygen potential of lead-bismuth with a gas phase.

The present volume contains the proceedings of this workshop. 53 scientists from Europe, USA and Japan presented 44 papers covering a wide range of topics including the status of spallation target R&D activities, effects of radiation damage, hydrogen, helium and other transmutation impurities in materials, particle transport calculations, heavy liquid metal corrosion and compatibility, and materials engineering. The main progress, with an emphasis on materials technology in different projects, namely the US Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), the European Spallation Source (ESS), the Japanese Spallation Neutron Source (JSNS), the Swiss Spallation Neutron Source (SINQ) and the US Accelerator Production of Tritium facility (APT) was overviewed. Progress from the European TECLA and SPIRE programs was described. The achievements of investigations in the last two years on mechanical properties and microstructures of materials under high-energy proton (spallation), neutron and low energy ion irradiations were reported. The latest results from studies on corrosion and embrittlement effects of heavy liquid metals (Hg, Pb-Bi and Pb) were presented. Some critical issues of liquid metal technology related to accelerator driven systems (ADS), e.g. oxygen control and oxygen measurements were discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this study, five kinds of fuel cycles were investigated. Required uranium enrichment, required natural uranium amount, and toxicity of heavy metals (HMs) in spent fuel were presented for comparison. The results showed that the enrichment and the required amount of natural uranium decrease significantly with increasing number of confined heavy nuclides when uranium is discharged from the reactor. On the other hand, when uranium is totally confined, the enrichment becomes extremely high. The confinement of plutonium and minor actinides (MA) seems effective in reducing radio-toxicity of discharged wastes. By confining all heavy nuclides except uranium those three characteristics could be reduced considerably. For this fuel cycle the toxicity of HMs in spent fuel become nearly equal to or less than that of loaded uranium.

From the measurements, the quantities of the activated radioactivities in biological shielding concrete were measured and evaluated for the clearance level. The average concentrations of Co-60, Eu-152 and Cs-134 formed in concrete were 21.9, 1.08 and 3.21 ppm, respectively. The combination of the concrete materials for the most lowering concentrations of Co-60, Eu-152 and Cs-134 was the limestone as aggregate and the white Portland cement produced in specific places. The most lowering concentrations of this limestone concrete were 0.16, 0.049 and 0.060 ppm, respectively. The limestone concrete was excellent as biological shielding concrete, because the neutron shielding effect was excellent a little compared with ordinary concrete. If this concrete used for biological shielding concrete, concrete waste will be able to handle as follows. Usage of this limestone low-activated concrete makes almost all concretes satisfy the clearance level for Co-60 after 20 yr cooling from decommissioning. In respect of Eu-152, radioactivation quantity in the biological shielding concrete is reduced up to a half of the average value or less. With regard to Cs-134, all concrete satisfies the clearance level.

Concentrations of I-129 in milk are regularly monitored and they are also predicted by modeling, the results of which are used to set limits on the discharges from Sellafield. It has been suggested that the analysis may under-estimate the concentration of I-129 in milk due to a "loss" of this radioisotope during storage of the milk before analysis takes place. This study used neutron activation analysis to determine I-129 in a milk sample obtained from a farm downwind of the Sellafield site, over a period of ten weeks. Sub-samples of milk were removed from storage and analyzed after 0, 3, 7, 14, 28, 49 and 70 days. A mean concentration of 4.4 mBq(.)l(-1) was determined in the milk and analysis of the results showed that there was no discernible loss of I-129 from the milk over the 10-week storage period. The stable iodine content of the milk was also determined and was found to be within the "normal" range quoted in the literature of between 0.01 and 1 mg(.)l(-1).

These techniques require extensive matrix separation and sample purification methods before unequivocal identification of specific isotopes and their relative abundance is possible. Counting techniques become very time consuming when the half-life of the target analyte is very long or the concentration of the analyte low. Atom counting using ICP-MS meets the nuclear industry requirements for many actinides and their daughter products. Recent improvements in quadrupole ICP-MS signal-to-background have resulted in attogram. mass detection capability and improved analysis of shorter half-life isotopes.

The U.S. Department of Energy and the resettled residents require reasonable but cost-prudent assurance that the doses to residents from residual Pu-239 will not exceed recognized international standards or recommendations, as estimated from the excretion of Pu-239 in urine. The goal of this study was to evaluate the bias, uncertainty and sensitivity of analytical techniques that measure 3-56 mu Bq Pu-239 in synthetic urine. The analytical techniques studied in this work included inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, thermal ionization mass spectrometry and fission track analysis. The results of the intercomparison demonstrated that all three techniques were capable of making the measurements, although not with equal degree of bias and uncertainty. The estimated minimum detectable activity was 1 mu Bq of Pu-239 per synthetic urine sample. This exercise is also the first effort to certify test materials of plutonium in the nBq(.)g(-1) range.

Different uranium clusters than those with FAB were observed. Three different fan-lilies of formula (UO2)(x)O-y(+), and two of formula (UO2)(x)O-y(2+) were found. While x increases, the O:U ratio tends to 3. The relationship between neighboring clusters can be described as (UO2)(x)O-y(+)<----> (UO2)(x-1)O-y-1(+)+UO3. The formation of clusters can be eliminated using some matrices, and a more sensitive uranium determination with a detection limit down to 10(-12)M is possible.

J	Reimer, GM				Reimer, GM			Ground-truthing predicted indoor radon concentrations by using soil-gas radon measurements	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Methods and Applications of Radioanalytical Chemistry (MARC-V)	APR 09-14, 2000	KAILUA-KONA, HAWAII	Amer Nucl Soc Top			RN-222 CONCENTRATIONS	Predicting indoor radon potential has gained in importance even as the national radon programs began to wane. A cooperative study to produce radon potential maps was conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Department of Energy (DOE), and Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) with the latter taking the lead role. They developed a county-wide predictive model based dominantly on the National Uranium Resource Evaluation (NURE) aerorad data and secondly on geology, both small-scale data bases. However, that model breaks down in counties of complex geology and does not provide a means to evaluate the potential of an individual home or building site. In this current study, soil-gas radon measurements on a large scale are shown to provide information for estimating radon potential at individual sites sort out the complex geology so that the small-scale prediction index can be validated. An example from Frederick County, Maryland indicates a positive correlation between indoor measurements and soil-gas data. The method does not rely on a single measurement, but a series that incorporate seasonal and meteorological considerations.

J	Blaauw, M; Glass, HJ; de Jong, P; van Dijk, W				Blaauw, M; Glass, HJ; de Jong, P; van Dijk, W			The Dutch norm for the determination of natural radioactivity levels in construction materials applied to concrete samples	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Methods and Applications of Radioanalytical Chemistry (MARC-V)	APR 09-14, 2000	KAILUA-KONA, HI	Amer Nucl Soc Top			GAMMA-RAY SPECTRA	In the near future, Dutch legislation will set an upper limit for the natural radiation exposure of inhabitants in newly built houses. Therefore, it is necessary to have standardized procedures available for the determination of the radon exhalation rate of and the activity levels in construction materials. In this paper we describe a method for determination of activity levels in construction materials. This method comprises radionuclide-specific calibration of Marinelli-beaker geometries with a range of material densities. This standard method was validated in a round-robin involving 6 laboratories, organized by two of the authors (M.B. and H.J.G.) of this paper. In this paper, results obtained according to the norm are compared with results obtained at IRI with a more elegant but possibly less robust method.

We conducted the field studies discussed in this report in 1996 near the Mayak Production Association in the South Urals, Russia. The primary purpose of the research was to apply new methods to study the distribution of a containment plume originating from Lake Karachai an unlined radioactive waste repository, which is currently migrating into the Mishelyak River valley. This research was conducted within the frontal part of the contaminant water plume. The studies from this work include: surface water and soil moisture sampling with in situ radiometric measurements. The data from the radiometric measurements obtained in the field were then compared to laboratory measurements of field samples. Due to the possible inflow of the radionuclides from the groundwater to the Mishelyak River, this paper also describes the study of river bottom sediments and water contamination.

S. Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management EM) is to clean up its contaminated sites from the past production of nuclear weapons. Within EM, the Office of Science and Technology (OST) is responsible for providing a full range of science and technology resources needed to support resolution of EM cleanup and long-term environmental stewardship problems. This responsibility includes implementation of a technology development pathway from basic research to development, demonstration, and deployment of scientific and technological solutions needed by DOE sites. One OST Program is the Characterization, Monitoring, and Sensor Technology Crosscutting Program (CMST-CP), which aims to provide innovative technologies (i.e., faster, better, cheaper, and/or safer) for environmental characterization and monitoring. This paper describes several technologies that CMST-CP has supported for development with significant benefits realized or projected over the baseline characterization and monitoring practices. Examples of these technologies include mapping of subsurface radioactivity using Cone Penetrometer and drilling techniques; a Rapid Liquid Sampler for Sr, Ra, Tc, and Cs using 3M Empore (TM) Rad Disks; Long-Range Alpha Detectors; a Compact High Resolution Spectrometer;, BetaScint (TM) for determination of Sr in soil; Laser-Induced Fluorescence Imaging techniques for mapping U on surfaces; the Environmental Measurements While Drilling System; and the Expedited Site Characterization methodology.
