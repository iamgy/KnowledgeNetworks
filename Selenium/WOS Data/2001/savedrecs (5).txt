J	Sono, H; Yanagisawa, H; Ohno, A				Sono, H; Yanagisawa, H; Ohno, A			Measurement of neutron and gamma-ray absorbed doses under criticality accident conditions at TRACY using tissue-equivalent dosimeters	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article								To evaluate neutron and gamma-ray absorbed doses in human bodies at criticality accidents, two kinds of tissue-equivalent dosimeters, a polymer-alanine dosimeter and a thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) made of (Li2B4O7)-Li-7-B-11, were applied to dosimetry experiments with similar to 10% enriched uranyl nitrate solution at the Transient Experiment Critical Facility (TRACY) in the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute. For the experiments, five transient operations were conducted to simulate criticality accidents by varying the conditions of reactivity addition. Very high doses from both neutrons and gamma rays were successfully measured in the range of 1.5 to 1600 Gy by using polymer-alanine dosimeters. The gamma-ray doses were able to be determined in the range of 1 to 900 Gy by using (Li2B4O7)-Li-7-B-11 TLDs. In addition, it is confirmed that the doses are proportional to integrated power during transient operations although the conditions of reactivity addition are different. Since the sensitivity of (Li2B4O7)-Li-7-B-11 to gamma rays is almost the same as that of alanine, the neutron doses are easily evaluated without any complicated correction by subtracting the gamma-ray doses obtained by the (Li2B4O7)-Li-7-B-11 TLDs from the sum of neutron and gamma-ray doses by the polymer-alanine dosimeters. As a result of computational analyses by the MCNP4B code, it is also found that calculated doses agree with measured ones within 95% confidence intervals and the MCNP4B is applicable to the evaluation of neutron and gamma-ray absorbed doses during the transient.

J	Charlton, WS; Stanbro, WD				Charlton, WS; Stanbro, WD			Monitors for the prediction of alternate nuclear material concentrations for pressurized water reactor spent fuel	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						spent fuel; alternate nuclear materials; reprocessing safeguards		A methodology for determining alternate nuclear material ((NP)-N-237, Am-241, and Am-243) concentrations in spent nuclear fuel based on the use of various monitors was developed and validated for use with several pressurized water reactor fuels. The monitors studied included the fuel burnup, the total plutonium concentration, the Pu-240/Pu-239 isotopic ratio, the Nd-148/U-238 isotopic ratio, and the Cs-137 activity. Calculations were performed using the HELIOS-1.4 lattice physics code for spent fuel from the Mihama Unit 3, Genkai Unit 2, and Calvert Cliffs Unit I reactors. These calculations were compared to measured values for the fuel. It was determined that the Pu-240/Pu-239 isotopic ratio and the Cs-137 activity were the most useful and accurate for use in predicting alternate nuclear material concentrations at reprocessing facilities for safeguards purposes. Based on these comparisons, it was determined that measurements of these monitors would allow for determination of Np-237, Am-241, and (243)AM concentrations to within +/-4, +/-6, and +/- 15%, respectively. It is suggested that these uncertainties may be decreased through improvements in measurement techniques and additional benchmarking. These monitors may be used to provide an accurate prediction of the concentrations of the alternate nuclear materials while decreasing the need for direct measurement of these isotopes. This will translate into a monetary savings for reprocessing facility safeguards.

Specific issues include when and how dismantlement should be accomplished and what the radwaste classification of the dismantled system would be at the time it is disassembled. Whereas radiation levels and residual radiological characteristics of the majority of the plant systems are directly measured using standard radiation survey and radiochemical analysis techniques. actual measurements of reactor zone materials are not practical due to high radiation levels and inaccessibility. For these reasons, neutron transport analysis was used to estimate induced radioactivity, and radiation levels in the Chernobyl NPP Unit I reactor core materials and structures. Analysis results suggest that the optimum period of safe storage is 90 to 100 yr for the Unit I reactor. For all of the reactor components except the fuel channel pipes (or pressure tubes), this will provide sufficient decay time to allow unlimited worker access during dismantlement, minimize the need for expensive remote dismantlement, and allow, for the dismantled reactor components to be classified as low- or medium-level radioactive waste. The fuel channel pipes will remain classified as high-activity, waste requiring remote dismantlement for hundreds of years due to the high concentration of induced Ni-63 in the Zircaloy pipes.

The removal of similar to 37 kg of fissile U-233 is the main activity. Of that inventory, similar to 23 kg has already been removed as UF6 from the piping system and chemisorbed in 25 NaF traps. This material is in temporary storage while it awaits conversion to a stable oxide. The planned recovery of similar to 11 kg of uranium from the fuel salt will generate another 15 to 19 NaF traps. The remaining 2 to 3 kg of uranium are present in activated charcoal beds, which are also scheduled to be removed from the reactor site. Since all of these materials (NaF traps and the uranium-laden charcoal) are not suitable for longterm storage, they, will be converted to a uranium oxide (U3O8), which is suitable for long-term storage. The conversion of the MSRE material into an oxide presents unique problems, such as criticality, concerns, a large radiation field caused by the daughters of U-232 (an impurity, isotope in the U-233), and the possible spread of the high-radiation field from the release of Rn-220 gas. To overcome these problems, a novel process was conceived and developed. This process was specially tailored for providing remote operations inside a hot cell while maintaining full containment at all times to avoid the spread of contamination. This process satisfies criticality concerns, maximizes the recovery of uranium, mini. mi. zes any radiation exposure to operators, and keeps waste disposal to a minimum.

Low-probability arguments are presented here. Guidance provided by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-the regulator of WIPP-allowed either qualitative "credibility" arguments or quantitative probability estimates when screening features, events, and processes such as criticality. Although information to quantitatively evaluate the probability of a criticality event was mostly lacking, qualitatively reasoned discussion of the inability to assemble a critical configuration of fissile material was accepted by the EPA. Specifically, after disposal and prior to an inadvertent human intrusion into the repository, there is no credible mechanism to move radioisotopes (and particularly, fissile material) since only small amounts of brine enter the repository, as adequately demonstrated in calculations over the years. An inadvertent human intrusion (an event that must be considered because of safety regulations) might allow a large pressure gradient to move more brine through the repository, but there is still no credible mechanism to counteract the natural tendency of the material to disperse during transport. Unfavorable physical conditions on concentrating fissile material include low initial solid concentration of fissile material, small mass of fissile material transported over 10 000 yr, and insufficient physical compaction; unfavorable hydrologic conditions include the limited amount of brine available to transport fissile material. Unfavorable geochemical conditions on concentrating the fissile radioisotopes include lack of sufficient adsorption and water chemistry conducive to precipitation.

J	Wagner, JC; Parks, CV				Wagner, JC; Parks, CV			A critical review of the practice of equating the reactivity of spent fuel to fresh fuel in burnup credit criticality safety analyses for PWR spent-fuel pool storage	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						burnup credit; criticality safety; spent-fuel storage		This research examines the practice of equating the reactivity of spent fuel to that of fresh fuel for the purpose of performing burnup credit criticality safety analyses for pressurized water reactor (PWR) spent-fuel pool (SFP) storage conditions. The investigation consists of comparing k(eff) estimates based on reactivity "equivalent" fresh fuel enrichment (REFFE) to k(eff) estimates using the calculated spent-fuel isotopics. Analyses of selected storage configurations common in PWR SFPs show that this practice yields nonconservative results (on the order of a few tenths of a percent) in configurations in which the spent fuel is adjacent to higher-reactivity assemblies (e.g., fresh or lower-burned assemblies) and yields conservative results in configurations in which spent fuel is adjacent to lower-reactivity assemblies (e.g., higher-burned fuel or empty cells). When the REFFE is determined based on unborated water moderation, analyses for storage conditions with soluble boron present reveal significant nonconservative results associated with the use of the REFFE. Finally, it is shown that the practice of equating the reactivity of spent fuel to fresh fuel is acceptable, provided the conditions for which the REFFE was determined remain unchanged. Determination of the REFFE for a reference configuration and subsequent use of the REFFE for different configurations violates the basis used for the determination of the REFFE and, thus, may lead to inaccurate, and possibly, nonconservative estimates of reactivity A significant concentration (similar to 2000 ppm) of soluble boron is typically (but not necessarily required to be) present in PWR SFPs, of which only a portion ( less than or equal to 500 ppm) may be credited in safety analyses. Thus, a large subcritical margin currently exists that more than accounts for errors or uncertainties associated with the use of the REFFE. Consequently, the findings presented here do not represent a significant safety concern unless/until the subcritical margin associated with the soluble boron (that is not currently explicitly credited) is offset by the uncertainties associated with burnup credit and/or the expanded allowance of credit for the soluble boron.

Both the X-rays and H+ (0.71 MeV), He+ (4.6 and 27 MeV), N+ (16 MeV) ion beams were used for irradiation of the crystals studied. Optical absorption spectra of KDP were measured after irradiation with various H+ ion beam doses, and accumulation of the radiation-induced defects was estimated. Considerations of the radiation effects in these crystals under irradiation with the ion beams were made taking into account the results of Monte Carlo simulations using the TRIM computer codes. Using the experimental and theoretical results the paper discusses the similarities and differences of these crystals with respect to radiation hardness and the processes of radiation energy storage.

The method, which is based on the work of Quintana and Fernandez (Appl. Radiat. Isot. 47 (1996) 911), can now be applied to many different experimental set-ups including both liquid and solid environmental samples, The method requires two different types of experimental inputs. Firstly, it requires measurements with radioactive sources emitting cascades of gamma rays covering the energy range of interest. Secondly, it requires measurements with sources emitting isolated gamma rays in order to provide coincidence-summing corrections. On this basis, we establish a general function to describe the energy dependence of the efficiency for the particular geometry and source matrix. The method has been applied to 11 different experimental arrangements to provide efficiency calibrations over the range 46.54-2000 keV with associated uncertainties ranging from 0.1% to 1.8%. This allows high precision measurements with environmental samples, which often have very low activities. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This counter uses custom electronics to identify and count coincidence neutrons in the presence of background radiation. Measurements of uranium standards were performed to evaluate the counter, This counter is successful in measuring uranium items but has a low efficiency that results in minimal improvement over current technology. An optimized counter can be built with better performance capabilities, but it is recommended that newer technologies be used instead. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The build-up transmutation equations of actinides content in an irradiated fuel are solved numerically. A computer code BAC was written to operate on a PC computer to provide the required calculations. The fuel element of 10% U-235 enrichment of ET-RR-I reactor was taken as an example for calculations using the BAC code. The results are compared with other calculations for the ET-RR-1 fuel rod. An estimation of fissile build-up content of a proposed new fuel of 20% U-235 enrichment for ET-RR-1 reactor is given. The sensitivity coefficients of build-up plutonium concentrations as a function of cross-section data uncertainties are also calculated. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The measurements were made from drilling cuttings from two deep wells drilled near the cities of Alvorada do Norte, northeast Goias State, and Montalvania. north of Minas Gerais State. The obtained results allowed the construction of the vertical profiles depicting the abundances of heat generating elements, of the heat production rate and of U/Th, U/K and Th/K ratios in these sediments. These profiles. which reflect both the lithology and the sediment history, are used to interpret some aspects of the Bambui Group sedimentation sequence. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Pelegrina, JMA; Martinez-Aguirre, A				Pelegrina, JMA; Martinez-Aguirre, A			Natural radioactivity in groundwaters around a fertilizer factory complex in south of Spain	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						natural radioactivity; fertilizer plant; groundwater; Spain	URANIUM; AQUIFER; RA-226	A study of the concentration of the U isotopes, Ra-226 and Th-230 in a groundwater system has been carried out. This aquifer, located in the provinces of Sevilla and Huelva, is the most important in the south of Spain having a surface area of 2500 km(2). The proximity of a fertilizer factory complex to this aquifer system is of particular concern given that it releases a significant part of its waste directly into the estuary of the Odiel and Tinto rivers, also storing a further part on the right batik of the Tinto river. Investigation has been made of the environmental impact of the fertilizer factory, either as a result of leaching of radionuclides from the phosphogypsurn piles or otherwise as a result of intrusion of the Odiel and Tinto waters, both of which are in close contact with the aquifer. Results show U concentration in waters of this system around the phosphogypsum piles to be significantly higher than those in other areas of the same aquifer. The low Ra-226 concentrations found in the same locations add support to the origin of part of the U in these samples. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The method of independent determination of the concentrations was used in simulating the rectification process. The liquid-vapor equilibrium problem was solved with a correction for the nonideality of the mixtures. Heat release due to tritium decay is taken into account in the heat balance equations. The quantum-statistical method was used to calculate the equilibrium constants for simulating the homomolecular isotopic exchange. The CRYDIST computer code implementing this method is used to determine the optimal parameters of the apparatus for separative processing of two isotopic mixtures with different composition and including two low-temperature rectification columns and two homomolecular isotopic exchange units.

J	Kashchuk, YA; Frunze, VV				Kashchuk, YA; Frunze, VV			Effect of a boron screen on the sensitivity of neutron fission chambers	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								It is suggested that absorbing screens with B-10 be used to maintain constant sensitivity under prolonged irradiation of fission chambers with natural uranium. The transmission factor T,(E) of boron screens with various thicknesses (8 = 0.1-2 ge/cm(2))for a wide neutron energy range and attenuation of a spectrum of the type phi(e)/E are estimated. The group and average group constants of the transmission factor of boron are calculated for neutron fluxes in 25 energy groups of the neutron cross sections library. The contribution of (238) U and (235) U to the signal of a fission chamber with natural uranium is analyzed as a function of the boron screen thickness. Pu-239 accumulation and U-238 burnup are estimated using 238U group capture cross sections, (238) U and Pu-239 fission cross sections, and the group values Talpha(E)DeltaE/E obtained by the authors. It is shown that in the absence of a boron screen for thermal-neutron fluence 10(17) cm(-2) the sensitivity of a fission chamber with natural uranium increases as a result of the formation of 239Pu. A boron screen with delta = 1 g/cm(2) makes it possible to maintain the sensitivity of the fission chamber constant up to thermal-neutron fluence 5(.)10(22) cm(-2).

Cathodic arc, or transferred-arc (TA) cleaning was employed to remove the deposits from the samples. The samples were characterized by ion beam analysis both before and after cleaning to determine deuterium and carbon concentrations present, The extent of TA cleaning was varied to determine the deuterium and carbon removal efficiency and sample erosion rate. The deuterium content was greatly reduced by the cleaning, thus demonstrating the possibility of using the TA cleaning technique for removing deuterium and/or tritium from components exposed to D-T fuels. The TA removal of carbon, tantalum and molybdenum contaminants from the same samples was also quantified. Removal of surface layers and significant reduction of subsurface concentrations of these contaminants were observed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

To optimize the tritium removal procedure, decontamination experiments using a gas purge with three different moisture concentrations were also performed. The surface tritium concentrations of CeO2 containing alkaline barium glass (NB), CeO2 containing lead glass (LX) and synthetic quartz (Quartz) after the exposure experiments were 7.80, 10.94 and 0.67 Bq/cm(2), respectively. It was found that the tritium concentration was influenced by the compositions of the materials. The concentrations of tritium on type 831 (solid lubrication material: graphite) and type 237 (solid lubrication material: tungsten disulfate) dry bearings after the exposure experiments were 89.80 and 31.78 Bq/cm(2), respectively. The tritium concentration in an electric cable tested was 5014 Bq/g after HTO moisture exposure. The tritium concentrations of lenses, LX, as typical experimental results, decreased to 2.72, 4.42 and 3.89 Bq/cm(2) by purging with the moist air, dry air and dry N-2, respectively. The tritium concentrations of dry bearing, type 831 dropped to 6.61, 9.42 and 10.16 Bq/cm(2) by the same three decontamination treatments, respectively. A large decontamination factor of 13.6 was achieved in the case of type 831 dry bearing with a moist air purge. The tritium concentration in the electric cable was 3236 Bq/g after a moist air purge, and the decontamination factor was as low as 1.6. Therefore, decontamination with a moist air purge is not so effective for the electric cable. (C) 2001 0Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Subtraction of dW/dt from the net heating power after the H-transition as done in H-mode power threshold analyses results in a wrong control action in feedback control during the confinement factor increment and abnormal behaviors in operation phases such as fusion power ramp-up, steady state, and shutdown phases in a reactor. As subtraction of dW/dt in the L-mode phase is to describe the delay time effect of the heating power to the plasma edge, we conclude that dW/dt should not be subtracted from the net heating power after the H-transition in the zero-dimensional approach. This is because that the H-mode is determined by the net heating power to the plasma edge both before and after the H-transition, but not by the plasma conduction loss power out of the plasma edge.

The permeation experiments were performed on pure tungsten foil of 25 mum thickness under conditions of incident flux of 1.9 x 10(18)-1.1 x 10(19) D+/m(2)s, incident ion energy of 200-2000 eV, and specimen temperature of 512-660 K. As a result of this steady-state permeation experiment, the rate-determining process of deuterium permeation was found to be controlled by diffusion at both implanted and permeated sides. On the other hand, transient permeation was strongly affected by trap effect in the specimen. Simulation analysis using TMAP code on transient permeation behavior indicates the existence of a trap site with a trap energy of nearly I eV and with a trap density of over several ten's ppm in tungsten.

J	Kamada, K				Kamada, K			Heating of deuteron implanted Al on electron bombardment and its possible relation to 'cold fusion' experiment	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						deuteron implantation; phonon maser; electron bombardment; cold fusion	EVOLUTION	This paper deals with the so-called 'phonon maser' due to the level splitting of deuterium imbedded in Al in a strong magnetic field. Since the wavelength of the phonon ranges around 0.1 mm, corresponding frequency of the phonon is in the radio frequency range. The present paper aims at an explanation of the anomalous melting of the AI surface implanted with deuterium on the irradiation with high energy electron in a transmission electron microscope. After theoretical and/or experimental examinations of several conventional mechanisms, all of them are classical processes and usually conceived by solid state or material scientists, we judged that the phenomenon cannot be accounted for by these classical processes, but require quantum theoretical mechanisms as a requisite. However, the present theory is rather preliminary and qualitative. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The sputtering yields were calculated based on the systematics for (n,p), (n,alpha), (n,2n), and (n,np) reactions. Four candidate piping materials of AISI Types 316L and 304 stainless steel, Incoloy 800, and V-4 Cr-4 Ti alloy were investigated to estimate their radioactivity sputtered to the coolant. The investigation shows that radioactivity of similar to 1500 to 2000 Ci sputtered into the coolant at 1000-s plasma burn time of ITER, and after 1-day cooling, a few curies of gamma activity remain in the coolant, which will accumulate in the heat exchanger.

In fact, calculating the probability of deuteron-plasmon fusion within a microcrack, showed, together with the enhancement of the tunneling effect, an increase of at least one to three orders of magnitude compared to the probability of fusion on the surface of the lattice. These phenomena open the way to the theoretical hypothesis that a kind of chain reaction, catalyzed by the microcracks produced in the structure as a result of deuterium loading, can favor the process.

J	Clarke, WB				Clarke, WB			Search for He-3 and He-4 in Arata-style palladium cathodes I: A negative result	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						palladium cathodes; tritium; helium isotopes; mass spectrometry	DEUTERATED PD-BLACK; COLD-FUSION; HELIUM HE-4(2)	The He-3 and He-4 concentrations in 2- to 6-mg samples of palladium-black from the interior of Arata-style cathodes were investigated using a tungsten wire furnace on-line to an ultrahigh sensitivity static mass spectrometer. The detection limit of the mass spectrometer was similar to 10(4) atoms He-3 and 10(8) atoms He-4, and the mass resolution of 1 part in 620 was sufficient to cleanly resolve He-3 from H-3 and HD. Three specimens of palladium black (A, B, and C) were from hollow Pd cathodes that had generated excess heat in D2O electrolysis experiments carried out by Arata and Zhang in their laboratory. One specimen of Pd-black (D) had not been used in any electrolysis experiment. A total of twelve samples, three from each specimen, were analyzed. The He-3 and 4 He concentrations were variable as if due to sample inhomogeneity. Two samples (C-1 and B-1) showed apparent He-4 of 4.4 X 10(9) atoms/mg and 6.6 X 10(9) atoms/mg, respectively, and three (A-3, B-2, and D-3) showed excess He-3 from 77 to 1096 X 10(3) atoms/mg relative to the atmospheric He-3/He-4 ratio. Seven samples showed no apparent excess of He-3 or He-4. Five samples of the aluminum foil used to wrap Pd-black samples were also analyzed and gave mean values of 13 +/- 18 X 10(3) atoms/mg and 1.50 +/- 0.66 X 10(9) atoms/mg for He-3 and He-4, respectively. The values for Al and Pd-black are comparable to the 1978 results of Mamyrin, Khabarin, and Yudenich, who examined helium isotopes in many ordinary metals and other materials including Al and Pd. At present, there is no evidence for the very much larger concentrations (10(16) to 10(17) atoms/mg) of He-3 and He-4 that A rata and Zhang claim to have detected in similar specimens of Pd-black from Pd cathodes subjected to D2O electrolysis.

There is no evidence for the much larger amounts of He-4 observed by Arata and Zhang in similar experiments. However, a very large concentration has been found of He-3, 2.3 +/- 0.5 X 10(12) atoms/cm(3) standard temperature and pressure that apparently can all be attributed to the decay of tritium produced during electrolysis. No direct production of He-3 can be specified, a result that is also different from the conclusions of Arata and Zhang. The He-3 and tritium measurements and the results of a gas analysis using a Finnigan-type mass spectrometer show that at the end of the anodic electrolysis, the electrode void contained 5.8 +/- 0.7 X 10(13) atoms tritium in the gas phase as HT, DT and T-2, and 1.7 +/- 0.3 X 10(15) atoms tritium in the aqueous phase as HTO, DTO, and T2O. At this stage, the gas phase pressure was similar to 18.8 atm in a free volume of 0.6 cm(3) and the total mass of water was similar to5.7 mg. The gas phase tritium value is viewed as a lower limit for gaseous tritium produced inside the electrode because some of that tritium must have been removed into the D2O electrolyte during the anodic episode. The He-3 and He-4 measurements were also made in the two samples of the Pd-black and in sections cut from the walls of both Pd electrodes. The H2O electrolyzed samples did not show any evidence of unusually high He-3 and/or He-4, but all the D2O electrolyzed samples showed clear evidence of He-3 from tritium decay. A stepwise temperature heating experiment performed with a 24.9-mg sample of the D2O Pd-black showed that the diffusion process for He-3 can be described by an equation of the form D = D-0 exp(-U/kT) with an activation energy U of 1.1 eV It is also apparent that the He-3 from tritium is quantitatively retained in the Pd-black at room temperature.

The objective of this review is to conduct a critical analysis of epidemiologic results currently available concerning the relationship between radon exposure and the risk of leukemia. Nineteen ecological studies, six miner cohort studies, and eight case-control studies published between 1987 and 2000 are included in this review. The limitations associated with each of these studies are discussed. The results of the ecological studies are relatively concordant and suggest an association between radon concentrations and the risk of leukemia at a geographic level. But these ecological studies present important limitations, and some are only crude analyses. Moreover, the results of the cohort and case-control studies, based on individual data, do not show any significant association between radon exposure and leukemia risk. Our conclusion is that the overall epidemiologic results currently available do not provide evidence for an association between radon exposure and leukemia.

J	Richardson, RB; Dunford, DW				Richardson, RB; Dunford, DW			Review of the ICRP tritium and C-14 internal dosimetry models and their implementation in the Genmod-PC code	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Review						dose, internal; tritium; C-14; modeling, dose assessment	METABOLISM	Biokinetic models for tritium and C-14 compounds, as described by various ICRP publications, have been incorporated into the Genmod-PC internal dosimetry code. This work reviews the models for tritium and C-14 labeled compounds that the ICRP has formulated over several decades. The ICRP dosimetry prescribed for hydrogen and carbon radionuclides is fundamentally different from that recommended for other elements in that it is based on retention functions for whole body activity instead of compartmental biokinetic models. The ICRP recommends dosimetric methods for tritium and C-14 compounds, ten of which are coded in Genmod-PC as compartmental models, namely, five tritium compounds, e.g., tritiated water, tritium gas, and five C-14 compounds, e.g., carbon dioxide, carbon-labeled methane. The values of the Genmod-PC calculated dose coefficients were compared with the ICRP's values. It is shown how the dose coefficients for intakes of tritium and C-14 compounds are affected by different interpretations of the methods recommended by the ICRP for two of the three classes of vapors and gases. Some aspects of the ICRP models, such as the percent oxidized, would benefit from reconsideration so as to produce tritium and C-14 biokinetics that are less dependent on the radionuclide.

J	Richardson, RB; Dunford, DW; Peterson, SR				Richardson, RB; Dunford, DW; Peterson, SR			Influence of gender differences in the carbon pool on dose factors for intakes of tritium and C-14-labeled compounds	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						dose, internal; tritium; C-14; modeling, dose assessment	DOSIMETRY; MODELS	The ICRP's biokinetic models for five tritium-labeled and five C-14-labeled compounds (not including radiopharmaceutical compounds and excepting carbon monoxide) incorporate a compartment representing the body carbon pool. Using the ICRP models, as coded into the Gemnod-PC internal dosimetry code, higher dose coefficients are calculated for females than for ICRP's Reference Man. The ICRP's committed effective dose coefficients for the ingestion of tritiated water and organically bound tritium by the adult male are 1.8 X 10(-11) and 4.2 x 10(-11) Sv Bq(-1), respectively. Using the Genmod-PC code, the corresponding dose coefficients for the adult female are 2.2 x 10(-11) and 6.2 x 10(-11) Sv Bq(-1), which are 25% and 46% greater than the adult male's. Similarly, the ICRP's dose coefficient is 5.8 x 10(-11) Sv Bq(-1) for an intake of organically bound C-14 by the adult male, and the estimated dose coefficient using Genmod is 54% greater for the adult female. The carbon retention half-time for an average adult female is calculated as 51 d and that for an average adult male, 38 d; the latter is similar to the carbon half-time of 40 d recommended by International Cormnission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). The longer turnover time of whole body carbon in females is one factor that causes the dose coefficients for females to be higher than those of males; a second factor is the smaller whole body mass of ICRP's Reference Woman compared to Reference Man.

The absorbed fractions (fraction of energy emitted that is absorbed by the target region) are calculated for tritiated particles deposited in the alveolar-interstitial (AI) region of the respiratory tract. The energy absorbed by radiologically sensitive tissue irradiated by tritiated particles, in regions of the lung other than in the Al region, is negligible. The ICRP Publication 71 assumes the absorbed fraction is unity for tritium deposited in the Al region. We employed Monte Carlo methods in a model to evaluate the energy deposition in the wall of the alveolar sac from particles of tritiated beryllium, tritiated graphite, titanium tritide, tritiated iron hydroxide and zirconium tritide. For the five materials examined, the absorbed fraction in alveolar tissue ranged from 0.31 to 0.61 for particles of 1 mum physical diameter and 0.07 to 0.21 for 5 mum diameter particles. The dose to alveolar tissue, for an acute inhalation of tritiated particles by an adult male worker, was calculated based on the ICRP 66 lung model and the particle dissolution model of Mercer (1967). For particles of 5 mum activity median aerodynamic diameter (AMAD), the committed equivalent dose to alveolar tissue, calculated for the five materials, ranged from 32-42%, respectively, of the committed equivalent dose derived assuming the absorbed fractions were unity.

J	North, DL; Shearer, DR; Hennessey, JV; Donovan, GL				North, DL; Shearer, DR; Hennessey, JV; Donovan, GL			Effective half-life of I-131 in thyroid cancer patients	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						cancer; thyroid; excretion, urinary; I-131		The oral administration of radioactive I-131 is a standard treatment for thyroid carcinoma. One consideration for this therapy is assuring that other people do not receive significant radiation exposure. In particular, federal and state regulatory authorities stipulate that no individual should receive more than 5 mSv (500 mrem) effective dose-equivalent from the released patient. Patients receiving more than 1.11 GBq (30 mCi) of I-131 were traditionally confined as in-patients by regulation until their burdens of radioactivity fell below that level or until the external dose rates were less than 50 mu Sv (5 mrem) per hour at I in. Recent regulatory guidance recommends the use of biological elimination as well as physical decay in calculating the confinement time to keep the effective dose-equivalent to members of the public less than 5 mSv. Analysis of a database of more than 250 administrations of I-131 for thyroid cancer shows a median effective half-life of at least 14 h, with substantial variation. Thus, discharge criteria for radiation safety purposes should be calculated on the basis of individual measurements. The release of these patients should not always be as prompt as the guidance indicates. The results also challenge some long-used assumptions regarding iodine excretion in this patient population.

Because the specific alpha activity ratio Pu/Np is about 600, a much more homogeneous lung irradiation was expected for NpO2. Materials and methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats were exposed once and their lung burdens were measured by X-ray spectrometry at different times post-exposure up to death. The time-course of doses delivered to the lungs were estimated, taking into account individual lung clearance parameters and body and lung weights. Gross lung pathologies were scored at autopsy. Results: In the range of initial lung deposits (ILD) studied (0.1-4 kBq), lung clearance impairment and reduced lifespan were only observed after exposure to NpO2. For similar ILD or doses, the highest incidences of lung lesions assumed to be tumours were observed for NpO2 with a saturation of lung tumour induction for doses larger than 8 Gy (ILD: 1.5 kBq). Up to 22 gy (ILD: 3.5 kBq), such saturation was not observed for PuO2. Conclusions: NpO2 appears much more toxic than PuO2. Before saturation, lung tumour incidence increased nearly linearly with dose, the slope of the curve for NpO2 being about twice as steep as that for PuO2.

No difference was found between the initial alteration rates measured on active and inactive glass specimens, nor in the long-term alteration rates at advanced stages of reaction progress (typically three or four orders of magnitude lower than the initial rates). At high reaction progress under conditions with very low solution renewal. however. the time necessary for the highly radioactive specimens to reach the low final rate is longer than for the non-radioactive glass. This behavior would suggest that the alteration films are slightly less protective under high beta gamma dose rates (> 100 rad h(-1)). The alteration layer has strong retention capacities for the actinides. The key processes, and the corresponding retention models, are highlighted. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The scarcity of these values under repository conditions leads to the use, in the PA studies, of the solubility of pure phases, which is a conservative assumption. Coprecipitation experiments are a very useful tool for giving realistic solubilities of key radionuclides. In this work, experimental data obtained from spent fuel (SF) and SIMFUEL coprecipitation tests under granite and saline conditions are presented. The experimental concentrations measured for several elements when equilibrium was achieved were much lower than expected considering only the solubility of pure phases. To explain this discrepancy, a tentative approach for modelling these experimental leaching and precipitation results of uranium, plutonium, americium, and strontium taking into account solid solution formations was made.

J	Mallants, D; Marivoet, J; Sillen, X				Mallants, D; Marivoet, J; Sillen, X			Performance assessment of the disposal of vitrified high-level waste in a clay layer	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Topical Workshop on Glass in its Disposal Environment	APR 11-14, 2000	BRUGGE, BELGIUM	Belgian Agcy Radioact Waste & Enriched Fissile Mat, Int Atom Energy Agcy				Deep disposal is considered a safe solution to the management of high-level radioactive waste. The safety is usually demonstrated by means of a performance assessment. This paper discusses the methodological aspects and some of the results obtained for the performance assessment of the disposal of vitrified high-level waste in a clay layer in Belgium. The calculations consider radionuclide migration through the following multi-barrier components, all of which contribute to the overall safety: (1) engineered barriers and the host clay layer, (2) overlying aquifer, and (3) biosphere. The interfaces between aquifers and biosphere are limited to the well and river pathway. Results of the performance assessment calculations are given in terms of the time evolution of the dose rates of the most important fission and activation products and actinides. The role of the glass matrix in the overall performance of the repository is also discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This report is important to obtain the confidence of HLW disposal system and to establish the implementation body in 2000. JNC has developed databases of glass dissolution and radionuclide migration for performance analysis of the engineered barrier system (EBS) and the geosphere for H12 report. The databases developed for H12 report are of dissolution rates of high-level radioactive vitrified waste, thermochemical data of radioactive elements (JNC-TDB), sorption/diffusion data in the EBS and the geosphere. The database development has been focused on the repository conditions, reducing conditions and compacted/intact system, e.g., actinide (IV)/(III), derivation of sorption coefficients from diffusion experiments rather than batch sorption experiments. The JNC-TDB and sorption database have been developed under the auspices of international experts. The quality of these databases has been checked through independent individual experiments, glass leaching, solubility, batch sorption, diffusion experiments and through coupled leaching experiments by using the fully high-level radioactive glass and plutonium-doped glass which were sandwiched between compacted bentonite saturated with water. The maximum concentration of insoluble elements dissolved from the glass has also been investigated to check the quality of the JNC-TDB by comparison with solubility prediction. Based on these studies. JNC has determined the transport parameters for H12 report: dissolution rate of glass for a soluble radioactive element (Cs). solubility for insoluble radioactive elements (e.g., actinides. Tc), distribution coefficients and effective diffusion coefficients in the EBS and the geosphere. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Chun, KS; Kim, SS; Kang, CH				Chun, KS; Kim, SS; Kang, CH			Release of boron and cesium or uranium from simulated borosilicate waste glasses through a compacted Ca-bentonite layer	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Topical Workshop on Glass in its Disposal Environment	APR 11-14, 2000	BRUGGE, BELGIUM	Belgian Agcy Radioact Waste & Enriched Fissile Mat, Int Atom Energy Agcy				The long-term release behavior of some elements from simulated borosilicate waste glasses (S-, K- and A-glass) in contact with a domestic compacted Ca-bentonite block and synthetic granitic groundwater at 80 degreesC under argon atmosphere has been studied by dynamic leach tests since 1997 at KAERI. S- and K-glass differ mainly in their aluminum content. and A-glass contains 19.35 wt% UO2 instead of fission product elements. Up to the present. the mass loss is almost the same as the normalized boron loss. This means that boron is an indicator on the dissolution of borosilicate waste glass. The leach rates of boron from K- and S-glasses after 861 days were approximately 3.1 x 10(-2) and 3.0 x 10(-2) g/m(2) day, respectively. However, the release rates of cesium through the bentonite block from K- and S-glasses were about 1/10th of the release rate of boron. which were almost the same around 2.5 x 10(-3) g/m(2) day. This may be due to their adsorption on the bentonite. The leach rate of boron from the A-glass was about 5.4 x 10-2, but the leach rate of uranium from the A-glass specimen was quite low. below 4 x 10(-7) g/m2 day. The low concentration of uranium in the leachates suggests that it hardly moves in a compacted bentonite block. By the EPMA, a yellowish uranium compound was deposited on the surface of the bentonite in contact with the A-glass specimen. The species of this phase should be identified to understand the release mechanism of uranium. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Th(IV), U(VI) and Am(III) in the alteration layer (gel layer) of precorroded simulated HLW glass is investigated by sorption experiments in water, NaCl and MgCl2 brine as a function of the pH. In water, the sorption behaviour of the four elements shows a strong dependence on the pH and the sorption coefficients (R-5) determined reflect the different charges of the three ions and the corresponding sorption properties. The R-5 values of Th are the highest values, followed by the R-5 values of Eu and Am, which are lower by about a factor of 10 at the respective pH. and finally by the R-5 values of U(VI) which are the lowest. The sorption behaviour of the four elements can be described by a Langmuir isotherm for pH values <5. As shown by modelling calculations. the strong increase of the R-5 values of Eu and Am, as well as of Th. with increasing pH can be described by the formation of a bidentate surface complex. Above pH 4-6, colloidal particles could be detected. From the concentrations of Nd in the solutions leached from the glass. 'desorption' coefficients (R-d) Of Nd can be calculated. The R-d values of Nd correspond quite well with the R-5, data of the chemically homologue Eu and Am. In NaCl brine the sorption behaviour of Th and U is rather similar to that in water, whereas in MgCl2 brine the sorption of Eu, Am, and U in the gel layer is much lower than in water or NaCl brine. The results of the sorption tests can explain the very low release and solution concentrations of REE and actinides found in corrosion experiments with the radioactive CEA glass R7T7 in NaCl-rich solution under neutral to alkaline conditions.

Observation and analysis of the alteration layer formed on glass surface were carried out by means of optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and analytical electron microscopy. Elemental concentrations of leachate were determined by ICP atomic emission spectroscopy, atomic absorption spectrometry and kinetic phosphorescence analyzer (KPA) (for uranium). An analytical electron microscopy provided that fibrous phase were developed on the outer surface of the alteration layer, as secondary phase, which should be clay minerals such as nickel-nontronite, or nickel-rich chlorite. Absence of uranium and rare earth elements (REEs) in the fibrous minerals suggests that the release of uranium and REEs can be controlled by precipitation of hydroxides rather than uptake in clay minerals. Experimental results and thermodynamic calculations suggest that the uranium concentration in the leachate is controlled by solubility of uranyl hydroxides such as UO(2)(OH)(2) (s).

The following results were obtained: (1) The concentration of dissolved species of Np in the leachate is 10(-7)-10(-8) M, which indicates that Np(IV) is the dominant oxidation state in the system and the concentration may be controlled by solubility of NpO(2x)H(2)O (am). (2) The presence of compacted bentonite facilitates reduction of Np(V) to Np(IV) in the system. (3) The apparent diffusion coefficient of the leached Np through the bentonite is evaluated to be lower than 1.5 x 10(-13) m(2)/s. showing that the diffusivity of Np(IV) is more than one order of magnitude lower than that of Np(V).

Loaded with simulated reactor waste, including fission products, the SON68 and SM513 HLW glasses were leached for 5 years, buried in Boom Clay at 85 degreesC, The results were evaluated by quantitative secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), using a step-scan technique yielding the in-depth concentration profiles of more than 20 relevant elements in successive sub-surface transformed layers to depths of the order of 500 mum. The observed elemental kinetics provided experimentally convincing evidence of a predominantly selective-substitutional leaching mode in both glasses, The rate of corrosion and element depletion in SON68 (a Cogema type glass) was found to be by ca 20-40% slower than in SM513 (Pamela-type). In the reacted layers of both glasses, 'mobile' elements (e.g., Li, Cs. B) were practically eliminated, but also Si was significantly depleted, while more 'inert' elements (e.g., Al, Zr, Cr) remained essentially preserved in the residual network of the 'gel'.

J	Rollin, S; Spahiu, K; Eklund, UB				Rollin, S; Spahiu, K; Eklund, UB			Determination of dissolution rates of spent fuel in carbonate solutions under different redox conditions with a flow-through experiment	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							OXIDIZING CONDITIONS; NUCLEAR-FUEL; ICP-MS; KINETICS; UO2	Dissolution rates of spent UO2 fuel have been investigated using flow-through experiments under oxidizing, anoxic and reducing conditions. For oxidizing conditions, approximately congruent dissolution rates were obtained in the pH range 3-9.3 for U, Np, Ba, Tc, Cs, Sr and Rb. For these elements, steady-state conditions were obtained in the flow rate range 0.02-0.3 ml min(-1). The dissolution rates were about 3 mg d(-1) m(-2) for pH > 6. For pH < 6, dissolution rates were strongly increasing for decreasing pH. Incongruent dissolution was found for Zr, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Am and the lanthanides. The dissolution rates with H-2(g) saturated solutions dropped by up to four orders of magnitude as compared to oxidizing conditions. Because of the very low concentrations, only U, Pu, Am, Mo, Te and Cs could be measured. For anoxic conditions, both the redox potential and dissolution rates increased approaching the same values as under oxidizing conditions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The deuterium permeation experiment was also carried out using the same tungsten specimen. The permeation of deuterium and tritium at steady state was found to be controlled by diffusion at implantation side and permeation side (DD regime). No significant isotope effect was observed on the steady-state permeation behavior between deuterium and tritium. On the other hand, the isotope effect on the effective diffusion coefficient in tungsten, derived from the analysis of transient permeation behavior, was observed between deuterium and tritium. The result indicates tritium has larger activation energy of effective diffusion than deuterium. It was not inconsistent with the reported isotope effects of diffusion coefficient for bcc metal, to which tungsten belongs. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Two types of simulated waste forms were studied: where the plutonium was alone in an LiCl/KCl matrix and where simulated fission-product elements were added representative of the electrometallurgical treatment process used to recover uranium from spent nuclear fuel also containing plutonium and a variety of fission products. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) studies were performed to determine the location, oxidation state, and particle size of the plutonium within these waste form samples. Plutonium was found to segregate as plutonium(IV) oxide with a crystallite size of at least 4.8 mn in the non-fission-element case and 1.3 nm with fission elements present. No plutonium was observed within the socialite in the waste form made from the plutonium-loaded LiCl/KCl eutectic salt. Up to 35% of the plutonium in the waste form made from the plutonium-loaded simulated fission-product salt may be segregated with a heavy-element nearest neighbor other than plutonium or occluded internally within the socialite lattice.

The influence of parameters such as the oxygen potential of the sintering atmosphere and pellet green density on the final microstructure was studied. Dilatometric analysis and monitoring of microstructural development revealed a phenomenon of abnormal grain growth promoting densification. The existence of a eutectic: between Cr and Cr2O3 is also discussed. Grain growth does not appear to be widely affected by small differences in residual porosity, which is a function of green density, so that it is possible to propose a solubility limit for Cr2O3 in stoichiometric: UO2 at 1700 degreesC. Examination of microstructural changes during annealing, with or without pore formers, showed the existence of limiting grain sizes for doped samples above the solubility limit. Lastly, experimental sintering conditions need to be checked in order to obtain reproducible results. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Gd-doped stoichiometric UO2's of various dopant contents [y = 0-0.29 in (U1-yGdy)O-2] were prepared. Weight gains by oxygen with increasing temperature for pulverized specimens were measured to obtain the oxidation kinetic curves. The oxidation kinetic curve for undoped UO2 shows a two-step reaction: UO2 --> U4O9 in the first step and U4O9 --> U3O8 in the second step. Decrease of the gradients of the oxidation kinetic curves for the first step with increasing content of Gd suggests that Gd dopant slowed down the reaction from (U1-yGdy)O-2 to (U1-yGdy)(4)O-9. Calculated O/(U + Gd) values from the weight gains and the deflection patterns of final stage of the oxidation revealed that the degree of-oxidation from (U1-yGdy)O-2 to (U1-yGdy)(3)O-8 decreased linearly with increasing content of Gd. Such behavior as the slowdown and the inhibition were interpreted by the chemical states of U atoms in the lattice structures depending on doping of Gd3+. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The O/M ratio which gave the steepest change of Delta(G) over bar (O2) (referred to as GOM) was 1.955 for y = 0.05, z = 0.1 (and y = 0.05, z = 0.05), but it decreased to 1.908 at higher Mg2+ concentrations of y = 0.1, z = 0.05. The GOM did not change with temperature in the range 1000-1200 degreesC. The solid solutions showed distinct Delta(S) over bar (O2) peaks of near 0 J mol(-1) K-1 at GOM, which was the same for Delta(H) over bar (O2) though the peaks were much smaller. The rates partial derivativea/partial derivativey and partial derivativea/partial derivativez for the lattice parameter change were -0.162 and -0.154 Angstrom, respectively. At GOM, the Mg2+ ions of a fraction of 0.473 of total Mg2+ ions occupy the interstitial position of the fluorite lattice. The averaged numbers of U5+ ions bonded to one Mg2+ ion, alpha, were very small, i.e. 0.1-0.4. The large leftward shift in the curves of Delta(G) over bar (O2) vs. O/M ratio for this quarternary solid solution was considered to be caused by these small alpha values.

J	Sheldon, RI				Sheldon, RI			An estimate of the high temperature, metal rich phase boundary of plutonium sesquioxide	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Letter							SYSTEM	The composition of the metal rich phase boundary of plutonium sesquioxide has been estimated at 1400 K by comparing the calculated, equilibrium pressure of Pu(g) over the solid solution range of the sesquioxide with the reported Pu(g) pressure over the mutually saturated system, Pu(liquid, O-2 saturated) + < Pu2O3-x> (hex). The Pu(g) pressure at the previously recommended metal rich phase boundary is shown to be low by a factor of nearly 3000. The newly estimated metal rich phase boundary results in a homogeneity range for the sesquioxide that is larger by a factor of 1.8. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ko, WI; Kim, HD				Ko, WI; Kim, HD			Analysis of nuclear proliferation resistance of DUPIC fuel cycle	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						DUPIC (direct use of spent PWR fuel in CANDU); (DUPIC) fuel cycle; nuclear fuel cycle analysis; nuclear proliferaion resistance; proliferation resistance barrier; safeguards; plutonium analysis; candu type reactors; spent fuels; fuel cycles		This study compares the proliferation resistance of DUPIC. (Direct Use of Spent PWR Fuel in CANDU) fuel cycle with other fuel cycle cases. The other fuel cycles considered in this study are PWR of once-through mode (PWR-OT), PWR of reprocessing mode (PWR-MOX), in which spent PWR fuel is reprocessed and recovered plutonium is used for making MOX (Mixed Oxide), CANDU with once-through mode (CANDU-OT), PWR fuel and CANDU fuel in a once-through mode with reactor grid equivalent to DUPIC fuel cycle (PWR-CANDU-OT). This study is focused on intrinsic barriers, especially, radiation field of the diverted material, which could be a significant accessibility barrier, amount of special nuclear material based on 1 GWe-yr that has to be diverted and the quality of the separated fissile material. It is indicated from plutonium analysis of each fuel cycle that the MOX spent fuel is containing the largest plutonium per MTHM but PWR-MOX option based on 1 GWe-yr has the best benefit in total plutonium consumption aspects. The DUPIC option is containing a little higher total plutonium based on I GWe-yr than the PWR-MOX case, but the DUPIC option has the lowest fissile plutonium content which could be another measure for proliferation resistance. On the whole, the CANDU-OT option has the largest fissile plutonium as well as total plutonium per GWe-yr, which means negative points in nuclear proliferation resistance aspects. It is indicated from the radiation field analysis that fresh DUPIC fuel could play an important radiation barrier role, more than even CANDU spent fuels. In conclusion, due to those inherent features, the DUPIC fuel cycle could include technical characteristics that comply naturally with the Spent Fuel Standard, at all steps along the DUPIC linkage between PWR and CANDU.
