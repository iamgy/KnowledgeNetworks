Internal contamination with thorium is considered as highly hazardous because of its radiological and chemical toxicities, which depend on the chemical form in which thorium appears. The assessment of the thorium body burden is then of primary importance in detecting the risks of personal contamination, and for appropriate counteractions when contamination is detected. The in vivo assessment of die thorium lung burden is commonly achieved by gamma ray spectrometry of its progeny. Three methods for the assessment of thorium in the lungs are compared. In the first method, the radionuclide examined is (TI)-T-208, measured with a NaI(TI) detector. This simple method can be affected by systematic errors due to Rn-220 exhalation and because of the assumption of equilibrium between Th-232 and Th-228. The second method, based on the measurement of the gamma rays emitted by Ac-228, requires the use of high-resolution gamma spectrometry (HPGe detectors), The accuracy of the thorium quantification is better with this technique. The third method is based on the measurement of exhaled Rn-220.

When these ores are processed, the associated radioactivity can be found in mineral concentrates, intermediates and final products, There is an incentive for industries to remove radioactivity from mineral products to allow the movement and Sale of these materials, both nationally and internationally, without the need for licensing. Control of thorium in various products involves the development and optimisation of process steps to be able to meet product specifications. The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) has undertaken a range of R & D programmes targeting the treatment of thorium-bearing minerals, This paper discusses the application of a microprobe technique for siting radioactivity in zircon and ilmenite and the problems experienced in measuring the concentrations in solid rare earth products.

An alpha track method was also used to analyse the solution sample, The detection efficiency calibration for the gamma ray spectrometry measurements on the solid samples was established using an in-house standard of thorium nitrate. A GESPECOR Monte Carlo simulation program was utilised in the analysis of the solution sample. The in-house thorium nitrate standard was also used to prepare standards for the alpha track method. The relative differences between the Th-232 activity concentration values determined in these intercomparison samples and values supplied by the NPL, UK, were found to be less than 5% when determined by the gamma ray spectrometry method and less than 8% when determined by the alpha track method.

These may be based on chemical or physical principles or may make use of the radioactive decay of the individual thorium isotopes. The method to be used for a certain analytical purpose is selected as a function of the matrix of the sample and of the concentration of thorium. The present paper describes different methodologies, their range of application and discusses selected results. The methods described cover a concentration range of more than twelve orders of magnitude, i.e. from concentrated solutions to micrometre-sized particles. Emphasis is given to active radiometric techniques, chemical and instrumental analysis.

Because thorium is usually found in very acid-resistant, mineral phases, this becomes even more critical when techniques such as ICP-MS are used, which require complete sample digestion. This paper gives an overview of the reference materials that are Currently available for thorium (Th-232 and other thorium isotopes) in various matrices, sources and indicative costs. The IAEA database is identified as a particularly useful source of information, and the website address is: http://www.iaea.org/programmes/nahunet/e4/nmrm/index.htm A brief summary of the discussion held at the '1st European Workshop on the Analysis of Thorium in Workplace Materials', regarding reference materials, is given at the end of the paper, A general need for new RMs, specifically for workplace materials, was identified as a priority.

Samples of such lenses have been obtained. etched to reveal that radon and radon progeny alpha tracks can be seen in abundance, and sensitivities have been calibrated in radon chambers as a primary calibration, and with a uranium-based source of alpha particles as a convenient secondary standard. With one exception natural, environmental (fossil) track densities ranged from less than 3,000 to nearly 70,000 per cm(2) for eyeglasses that had been worn for various times from one to nearly five years. Average radon concentrations to which those wearers were exposed are inferred to be in the range 14 to 130 Bq.m(-3) (0.4 to 3.5 pCi.l(-1)). A protocol for consistent, meaningful readout is derived and used, In the exceptional case the fossil track density was 1,780,000 cm (2), and the inferred (24 h) average radon concentration was 6500 Bq.m(-3) (175 pCi.l(-1)) for a worker at an inactive uranium mine that is used for therapy.

J	Dixon, DW				Dixon, DW			Radon exposures from the use of natural gas in buildings	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								Low levels of natural radioactivity in the round produce radon-222 and its decay products which can be entrained with gas, streams and become distributed with gas supplies to commercial and domestic users. Levels of radon in blended gas received by most users are comparable with the levels that are present naturally in buildings as a result of ingress from the ground and this is further diluted during the combustion process. For typical rates of gas usage with an average radon level of about 200 Bq.m(3), the estimated dose from the use of natural gas is estimated at 4 muSv, less than 1% of the dose from radon exposure at the average level in UK homes. Commercial users may receive somewhat higher doses, and the estimate for a critical group is a few lens of microsievert. The total radon emission to the environment is estimated at about 10(13) Bq.y(-1) which represents less than 10(-4) of the natural emission rate from the ground. There is some variability of radon levels in.-as from different Sources and it would be prudent to keep this source of exposure under review. A standard sampling and measurement protocol has been developed in conjunction with a technical group representing the industry.

Young adult mule Wistar rats were exposed to polydisperse aerosols of Pu(NO3)(4) with 0.6 mum in activity median aerodynamic diameter. They were periodically killed and the radioactivity of Am-241 and Pu-238/239/240 in the autopsied lungs was measured. It has been shown that the Am-241 was cleared from the lungs at almost the same rate as the Pu at least for half a year post-inhalation, which proved the validity of Am-241 as a metabolic tracer for inhaled Pu nitrate in external chest counting.

Soil sampling was performed to assess the spread of DU ground contamination around and within the NATO target sites and the migration of DU along the soil profile. The U-234/U-238 and U-235/U-238 activity concentration ratios have been used as an indicator of natural against anthropogenic sources of uranium. The results show that levels of U-238 activity concentrations in soils above 100 Bq.kg(-1) can be considered a 'tracer' of the presence of DU in soils. The results also indicate that detectable ground surface contamination by DU is limited to areas within a few metres from localised points of concentrated contamination caused by penetrator impacts. Vertical distribution of DU along the soil profile is measurable up to a depth of 10-20 cm. This latter aspect is of particular relevance for the potential risk of future contamination of groundwater.

Results obtained by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), semiconductor alpha spectrometry and low level liquid scintillation counting with alpha/beta discrimination (LSC) have been compared. High resolution gamma spectrometry and semiconductor alpha spectrometry have been used to analyse uranium in a variety of organic and inorganic samples. Isotopic secular equilibrium in the U-238 series may The lacking or hidden by auto-absorption phenomena, so caution should be used in evaluating gamma spectrometry data. Alpha spectrometry has also been used to ascertain the possible pollution from depleted uranium in the environment.

This method requires separate knowledge of the soil density and of the radioactivity distribution relative to soil depth. In-field gamma spectrometry measurements were performed together with samplings of the soil at the same site for subsequent gamma spectrometry analysis in the laboratory. Results of Cs-137 concentration were compared in order to: (i) verify the effectiveness of in situ gamma spectrometry in averaging local inhomogeneties in the soil; and (ii) quantify the sensitivity of the gamma ray spectrometry soil radioactivity evaluation with respect to the variability of the depth profiles obtained from a single site sampling. The site of study is a high altitude pasture, in the Alpine environment.

The expected values have been compared with the experimental results obtained by using mollusc samples gathered in the Adriatic Sea. The analysis has shown that it is possible to detect DU, if the percentage composition is about 20% depleted uranium and 80% natural uranium, for a sample containing 10 Bq.kg(-1) of U-238. The possibility of extending this approach to samples with any given uranium concentration is investigated.

'Low' energy in this context is taken to mean proton energies of less than about 1 GeV. Many of the radiation issues are common to all particle accelerators. Here. those issues are addressed that may require perhaps not unique treatment but those which benefit from a different approach. Among the problems discussed are the generation of prompt radiation and its transmission through shielding, the estimation of induced radioactivity, and the assessments of both the off-site prompt radiation hazard and the effect of releases of radioactive effluents to the environment.

An overview is first given of general safety requirements. Next, shielding and labyrinth design are discussed in some detail for the various types of accelerators, devoting more attention to hadron machines as they are far less conventional than electron linear accelerators. Some specific aspects related to patient protection are also addressed. Finally, induced radioactivity in accelerator components and shielding walls is briefly discussed. Three classes of machines are considered: (1) medical electron linacs for 'conventional' radiation therapy, (2) low energy cyclotrons for production of radionuclides mainly for medical diagnostics and (3) medium energy cyclotrons and synchrotrons for advanced radiation therapy with protons or light ion beams (hadron therapy).

The National Centre of Hadrontherapy, which is planned to be built in Italy in the next five years, is considered as a reference facility for applying the various methodologies presented. The shielding design is firstly discussed, together with that of the access maze to the treatment rooms. Subsequently, the main aspects for the estimate of the air activation in the environment hosting the accelerator system are described. The estimate of the dose equivalent due to the activated air transferred to the neighbourhood population is also treated. Outlines are given of the radioactivity induced by the primary beam in the materials constituting the magnets and the patient's personal collimator.

A site-specific biometric equation has been developed for these workers, who are somewhat smaller than other workers reported in the literature. Chest wall thickness is an important modifier on lung counting efficiency. These data have been put into the perspective of the ICRP recommended dose limits for occupationally exposed workers: 100 mSv in a 5-year period with a maximum of 50 mSv in any one year. For measured chest wall thicknesses of 1.9 cm to 4.1 cm and a 30 min counting time. the achievable MDAs for natural uranium in the KAERI lung counter vary from 6.6 mg to 13.2 mg. These values are close to, or even exceed, the predicted amounts of natural uranium that will remain in the lung (absorption type M and S) after an intake equal to the Annual Limit on Intake corresponding to a committed dose of 20 mSv. This paper shows that the KAERI lung counter probably cannot detect an intake of Type S natural uranium in a worker with a chest wall thickness equal to the average value (2.7 cm) under routine counting conditions.

In this study the individual radon progeny concentrations were measured in three Egyptian underground phosphate mines to estimate the occupational exposure of the workers at those sites. A filter method was used to measure individual radon progeny concentrations (Po-218, Pb-214 and Po-214). The reported mean values of radon progeny concentrations exceed the action levels which are recommended by ICRP 65 (1993). Based on the measured individual radon progeny concentrations (Po-218, Pb-214 and Po-214) in these mines, the annual effective dose for the workers has been calculated using the lung dose model of ICRP 66 (1994). According to the obtained results, some countermeasures were recommended in this study to minimise these exposure levels.

The radionuclides Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 were determined with city mean specific activities 47 +/- 21 Bq.kg(-1), 52 +/- 21 Bq.kg(-1), and 352 +/- 222 Bq.kg(-1), respectively. These activities amount to a radium equivalent of about 150 Bq.kg(-1), which is lower than the recommended maximum value of 370 Bq.kg(-1). The mean value of the external hazard index was Found to be 0.41 which implies that the building blocks used in the city of Ibadan are within the acceptable level of radioactivity. The mean indoor gamma dose equivalent to individuals due to the walls was calculated to be 412 mu Sv.y(-1) and the collective dose equivalent 563 man.Sy.y(-1).

The total number of workers registered during the period of 1984 to 1999 was 64,518. The number increased steadily and the accumulated dose also increased. The proportion of radiation workers by occupation was 38.4% for nuclear power plants, 20.3% for industrial organisations and 12.4% for non-destructive industry. The annual collective dose of radiation workers was 31.72 man.Sv in 1999, The mean annual dose by sex was 1.49 mSv for mates and 0.56 mSv for females and the mean annual dose for a worker was 1.41 mSv with the highest mean dose being received by non-destructive industry (3.53 mSv), Very few workers (0.8%) received more than 20 mSv (2 rem) and only one more than 50 mSv, the legal limit for an annual dose increase. There has been a steady decline in the mean dose since 1984, showing a significant decrease in dose with time (p <0.001). The data showed that radiation protection in Korea was improving, though annual doses were still higher than other countries.

This episode occur-red in the city of Goiania, during Brazil's worst radiological accident ever reported. Using the technique of gamma ray spectrometry, analyses of both surface and profile soil and vegetable samples were made. High values of Cs-137 activity per unit mass were found in soil layers at depths between 10 and 40 cm from the surface. Some values exceeded by up to eight times the action level of 22.5 kBq.kg(-1) proposed by the Brazilian National Nuclear Energy Commission (CNEN) during the decontamination process at the time of the accident, for the first year after the accident. Absorbed dose rates at I ra above the ground were calculated from the data of Cs-137 concentration in the soil and compared with those obtained from in situ gamma ray spectrometry and from thermoluminescence dosimetry.

J	Leggett, RW				Leggett, RW			Reliability of the ICRP's dose coefficients for members of the public. 1. Sources of uncertainty in the biokinetic models	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Review							COMPARATIVE METABOLISM; HUMANS; RADIONUCLIDES; RETENTION; ELEMENTS; MAMMALS; LEAD; RAT; ABSORPTION; PLUTONIUM	During the decade following the Chernobyl accident, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) developed dose coefficients (doses per unit intake) for ingestion. or inhalation of radionuclides by members of the public. The level of uncertainty in those coefficients varies considerably from one radionuclide to another, due largely to differences in the level of understanding of the biological behaviour of different elements in the human body. This paper is the first in a series that examines the sources and extent of uncertainties in the ICRP's biokinetic and dosimetric models for members of the public and the dose coefficients derived from those models. The present paper describes the different types of information generally used to develop biokinetic models for radionuclides, the main sources of uncertainty associated with each type of information, and the approach used in subsequent papers in this series to quantify the uncertainties in biokinetic and dosimetric estimates.

The specific absorbed dose rates due to natural radioactivity emanating from the walls, floors and ceilings of the typical model rooms made of these building bricks have been calculated applying the mesh size adaptive volume integral methodology, The occupancy factor, representing the weighted average of all the population in the country, was taken to be 0.3 in this study. The values of estimated annual effective dose rates for whole body were found to be 0.38 and 0.35 mSv.y(-1) for the two types of model rooms. These values are smaller than those predicted by UNSCEAR for normal background areas. Thus the building bricks analysed in this study do not pose any significant health problem to the population.

J	Thorson, IM				Thorson, IM			Transmutation of commercial waste should precede geological storage - Opposing the proposition: Argument	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Editorial Material								Technology has provided solutions for many of our problems, The generation and distribution of electricity to our homes and businesses has made possible our comfortable modern lifestyle. Of course, nothing comes without a price, and one of the prices we pay for our electrically powered world is the difficulty of managing the wastes resulting from power production. The basic methods used to deal with many types of waste are generally rather primitive. Waste products may be diluted, dispersed or buried in approved places. Rather few waste products resulting from the production of electric power are biodegradable. However, when it comes to nuclear waste, transmutation may offer a solution to a problem that has existed in many countries for many years, if it proves to be technologically and economically feasible. Recently, there have been severe electric power problems in the US. These problems have stimulated renewed interest in developing additional sources of power, with nuclear power being one of those sources. The prospect of increasing the number of nuclear power reactors, while the US capabilities for long-term geological storage of spent fuel are still unclear, is daunting. Transmutation of long-lived isotopes in spent fuel to shorter-lived or more benign isotopes may be necessary, if the process can be performed economically.

Uncertainties in the absorption of ingested radionuclides and the effect on dose estimates	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Review							GASTROINTESTINAL ABSORPTION; ENVIRONMENTAL PLUTONIUM; URINARY-EXCRETION; TRANSIT-TIME; HUMAN GUT; RETENTION; METABOLISM; URANIUM; TRACT; LEAD	Data on the gastrointestinal absorption of 12 elements have been reviewed. In each case, absorption is expressed as the fraction of the ingested element absorbed to blood. referred to as the f(1) value, applying to intakes of unspecified chemical form by average population groups. The level of confidence in individual absorption values has been estimated in terms of lower and upper bounds, A and B, Such that there is judged to be roughly a 90%, probability that the true central value is no less than A and no greater than B. Ranges are proposed for intakes by adults, 10-year-old children and 3-month-old infants. Uncertainty in f(1) values (B/A) ranged from 10% to factors of 100-400. The lowest uncertainties were for the well absorbed elements, H, I and Cs, for which there are good data, and the greatest uncertainties Acre for less well absorbed elements for which few data are available, particularly Zr and Sb. Ranges were generally wider for children and infants than for adults because of the need to allow for the likelihood of increased absorption with only limited data in support of the proposed values. The largest ranges were for 3-month-old infants, reflecting lack of knowledge on the time-course and magnitude of possible increased absorption in the first fev, months of life. For each age group, ICRP values of absorption tend towards the upper bound of the ranges, indicating a degree of conservatism in the calculation of ingestion dose coefficients. Examination of the effect of the proposed confidence intervals for f(1) values on uncertainties in dose coefficients for ingested radionuclides showed that there was no direct relationship. For some radionuclides, uncertainties in effective dose were small despite large uncertainties in f(1) values while for others the uncertainties in effective doses approached the corresponding values for uncertainty in f(1) values. These differences reflect the relative contributions to effective dose from cumulative activity in the contents of the alimentary tract, which in many cases is insensitive to uncertainties in f(1), and cumulative activity of the absorbed radionuclide in systemic tissues, which is proportional to f(1). In general. uncertainties in effective dose for children and infants exceeded those in adults as a result of greater uncertainties in f(1) values for the younger age groups. However. this effect was reduced in some cases by shorter retention times of absorbed nuclides in body tissues and organs.

The effect of these parameters on the dose coefficient has been studied. A theoretical analysis was carried out to determine the sensitivity of the dose coefficient to variations in the values of these absorption parameters. Experimental values of the absorption parameters and the doses per unit intake (DPUI) were obtained from in vitro dissolution tests, or from in vivo experiments with rats, for five industrial uranium compounds UO2, U3O8, UO4, UF4 and a mixture of uranium oxides. These compounds were classified in terms of absorption types (F, M or S) according to ICRP. The overall result was that the factor which has the greatest influence on the dose coefficient was the slow dissolution rate si. This was verified experimentally, with a variation of 20% to 55% for the DPUI according to the absorption type of the compound. In contrast, the rapid dissolution rate s(r) had little effect on the dose coefficient, excepted for Type F compounds.

The calibration procedure involves measuring the energy deposited in the detector using 10 radioactive sources of known activity covering an energy range from 60 keV to 1836 keV. For each of the 10 sources, gamma ray spectra were measured with the source at different angles to the detector axis. The total energy deposited in the detector for the ten sources was confirmed by Monte Carlo calculations. The spectra measured at different angles were combined to produce a spectrum that would represent a homogeneous semi-infinite source of radiation. The resultant spectrum was then subdivided into 10 energy regions. Based on the known air kerma rates due to the sources, a calibration coefficient was calculated for each of the 10 energy regions. These calibration coefficients could then be used to convert the energy deposited in the 10 regions of an unknown spectrum to air kerma rate. The calibration procedure was confirmed by comparing the results from the detector with those from calibrated collimated beams of Cs-137 and Co-60.

Two models for the prior probability distribution an proposed: (1) the log-normal distribution, when there is some additional information to determine the scale of the true result, and (2) the 'alpha' distribution (a simplified variant of the gamma distribution) when there is not. These models have been incorporated into version 3 of the Bayesian internal dosimetry code in use at Los Alamos (downloadable from our web site). Plutonium internal dosimetry at Los Alamos is now being done using prior probability distribution parameters determined self-consistently from population averages of Los Alamos data.

These processes strongly affect the dose relevant quantities like concentration and particle size distribution of the short-lived radon decay products. The neutralisation rate of the positive (218)po ions in environmental air was determined quantitatively in chamber experiments. The experimental results show the great influence of the ionisation rate and the humidity concentration on the neutralisation rate of the Po-218 ions in air. The obtained neutralisation rates were described by equations, taking into account the neutralisation processes like ion recombination, charge transfer and electron scavenging. In 'normal' environmental air with an ionisation rate of 45 muR.h(-1) = 1.16 x 10(-8) C/(kg.h) and a relative humidity of 50% (T = 20 degreesC), a neutralisation rate of the Po-218 ions of 1.54 X 10(-2) s(-1) was obtained. Taking into account this neutralisation rate leads to a fraction of about 51% of the Po cluster that are neutral in air.

J	Agren, G				Agren, G			Seasonal and long-term variations in Cs-137 among adults from Swedish hunter families	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							RADIOACTIVE CESIUM; SWEDEN	To study seasonal variations in Cs-137, whole-body content measurements of adults from Swedish hunter families have been performed in autumn 1997 and spring 1998. Measurements were performed in three locations, By, Harbo and Gavle, geographically close (within 100 km of each other) but with large differences in ground deposition levels. The hunter families at these three locations were previously measured in 1994. The measured persons were also asked for their frequency of intake of moose, roe-deer, reindeer, freshwater fish, mushrooms and berries. A statistically significant lower frequency of intake of mushrooms and berries in By, moose, roe deer and mushrooms in Harbo, and moose in Gavle was found in springtime compared to autumn. In one of the locations, there was a statistically significant lower average Cs-137 whole-body content in spring 1998 than in autumn 1997 while in the other two locations no such effects could be seen. The Cs-137 whole-body content has decreased by 37% from 1994 and to 1998 (including physical decay) correlated to an effective ecological half time of 6 years.

Samples of hafnium tritide were placed in a lung simulant fluid to determine approximate lung dissolution rates. Hafnium hydride samples were analysed for particle size distribution with a scanning electron microscope. Lung simulant data indicated a biological dissolution half-time for hafnium tritide on the order of 10(5) d. Hafnium hydride particle sizes ranged between 2 and 10 mum, corresponding to activity median aerodynamic diameters of 5 to 25 mum. Review of in vitro dissolution data, development of a biokinetic model, and determination of secondary limits for 1 mum AMAD particles are presented and discussed.

J	Kotzer, T; Trivedi, A				Kotzer, T; Trivedi, A			Dosimetric implications of atmospheric dispersal of tritium near a heavy-water research reactor facility	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								An estimate of the tritium dose to the public in the vicinity of the heavy water research reactor facility at AECL-Chalk River Laboratories, Ontario, Canada, has largely been accomplished from analyses on regularly-collected samples of air, precipitation, drinking water and foodstuffs (pasture, fruit, vegetables and milk) and environmental dose models. To increase the confidence with which public doses are calculated, tritium doses were estimated directly from the ratio of tritiated species in urine samples from members of the general public. Single cumulative 24 h urine samples from a few adults living in the vicinity of the heavy-water research reactor facility at Chalk River Laboratories, Canada were collected and analysed for tritiated water and organically bound tritium. The participants were from Ottawa (200 km east), Deep River (10 km west) and Chalk River Laboratories. Tritiated water concentrations in urine ranged from 6.5 Bq.l(-1) for the Ottawa resident to 15.9 Bq.l(-1) for the Deep River resident, and were comparable to the ambient levels of tritium-in-precipitation at their locations. The ultra-low levels of organically bound tritium in urine from these same individuals were measured by He-3-ingrowth mass spectrometry and were 0.06 Bq.l(-1) (Ottawa) and 0.29 Bq.l(-1) (Deep River). For Chalk River Laboratories workers, tritiated water concentrations in urine ranged from 32 Bq.l(-1) to 9.2 x 10(4) Bq.l(-1), depending on the ambient levels of tritium in their workplace. The organically bound tritium concentrations in urine from the same workers were between 0.08 Bq.l(-1) and 350 Bq.l(-1). With a model based on the ratio of tritiated water to organically bound tritium in urine, the estimated dose arising from organically bound tritium in the body for the Ottawa and Deep River residents was about 26% and 50%, respectively, of the body water tritium dose. The workers in a reactor building at Chalk River Laboratories had less than 10% dose contribution from organically bound tritium, but had higher overall tritium dose due to frequent intakes of tritiated water vapour in the workplace. The results of this study suggest that most of the tritium dose to workers at Chalk River and general population near Chalk River is the result of tritiated water intakes and not due to dietary intake of organically bound tritium.

Exchange Velocities of tritiated water vapour between air and water were evaluated from tritium concentrations in air and water obtained in the field experiment. It was found that the average of outdoor exchange velocities was about three times greater than that observed in a nuclear reactor room previously. Relationships between the outdoor exchange velocities and meteorological conditions were analysed to derive a multiple correlation equation. The wind speed was strongly correlated with the exchange velocity and the air temperature appeared to have an enhancing effect on the velocity. These observations were supported by a follow-up experiment conducted on a laboratory scale.

Almost all doses to the neighbouring residents were brought by neutrons and gamma rays emitted from the facility rather than fission products released to the environment. External doses in the environment were evaluated using radiation monitoring data and radiation transport calculation. A pattern of the dose rate evolution was modelled based on the records of gamma ray monitors in the JCO facilities. Relations between the ambient dose equivalent rates of neutrons/gamma rays and the distance from the facility were determined from the monitoring data obtained around the accident site. Conversion from the ambient dose equivalent to the effective dose equivalent was made assuming the energy spectra calculated by the radiation transport code, ANISN. It was estimated that the people who stayed outside the 350 m zone would receive doses of less than 1 mSv.

J	Koarashi, J; Amano, H; Andoh, M; Iida, T; Koma, T				Koarashi, J; Amano, H; Andoh, M; Iida, T; Koma, T			A new method for determining HT deposition velocity and dependence of the velocity on environmental factors	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							MOLECULAR TRITIUM; SOIL; BEHAVIOR; ATMOSPHERE; OXIDATION; MOISTURE; SURFACE; RELEASE	A new method was developed to determine HT deposition velocity and to investigate how environmental factors affect the deposition processes including the diffusion into soil and the biochemical conversion by microorganisms to HTO in soil. This method, using a chamber and two tritium samplers, enables determination of the HT deposition velocity in situ without a large scale experiment and an additional tritium source. The main problem concerning the use of a flow-through method is the possible effect of flow rate on flux measurement. Since the tritium sampler used in this study has many collecting columns, the flow rate is limited. Experimental results showed no significant effect of how rate over a low range from 0.48 to 0.95 1.min(-1). From the increase of HT deposition velocity with increase of water content, it was indicated that biochemical oxidation rather than physical diffusion dominantly affects the HT deposition velocity under examined site conditions. No clear relationship between the HT deposition velocity and atmospheric temperature, relative humidity or soil temperature was observed. The soil temperature was only of secondary importance as a factor controlling the HT deposition velocity.

J	Sam, AK; Abbas, N				Sam, AK; Abbas, N			Assessment of radioactivity and the associated hazards in local and imported cement types used in Sudan	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							BUILDING-MATERIALS; NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY	Activity concentration of Th-232, Ra-226 and K-40 in local (Atbra and Rabak) and imported cement types (Jordanian, Indonesian and Seabulk) has been measured using high-resolution gamma -spectrometry. The average values obtained for Th-232, Ra-226 and 40K activity concentrations in different cements are lower than the corresponding global values reported in UNSCEAR publications. The radium-equivalent activity (Ra,,) of the samples was calculated and compared with similar data reported in the literature. The comparison has revealed that Ra,, values obtained Fall far below the criterion limit specified for building materials. The potential radiological hazard of the different samples was estimated using different approaches: representative level index and annual dose limit (dose due to gamma radiation inside the room and inhalation of radon). The estimated representative level index for all the samples is less than unity (the upper limit) indicating that the associated gamma radiation level is low. The annual dose limit falls within 0.19 to 0.30 mSv, which is an order of magnitude below the criterion limit specified for building materials in the literature.

The uncertainties in estimated body burdens of Cs-137 With the JAERI whole-body counter were investigated using Monte Carlo simulation and measurements. It was found that the uncertainties of estimated body burdens with the whole-body counter are strongly dependent on various sources of uncertainty, such as radioactivity distribution within the body and counting statistics and that the Cs-137 body burden assessed from the result of the whole-body count can be within +/- 60% in error.

The influence of the ventilation rate and nature of the building material has been investigated. Equivalent dose rates and annual committed effective doses due to the inhalation of radon decay products have been determined in the respiratory system by using a dosimetric compartmental model. The influence of the deposition fraction, residual time and activity absorbed fraction of the respiratory system compartments for the radon daughters has been studied.

The hydrolysis constants are selected preferentially from experimental studies at actinide trace concentrations. where the interference of colloid formation can be excluded. Unknown formation constants of mononuclear complexes An(OH)(n)(4-n) are estimated by applying a semi-empirical electrostatic model and an empirical correlation with the known constants of other actinide ions. Based on the known and estimated hydrolysis constants, the solubility products of An(OH)(4)(am) or AnO(2). xH(2)O(am) are calculated from experimental solubility data available in the literature. The SIT is used for ionic strength corrections. The solubilities of U(IV), Np(IV), and Pu(IV) hydroxides or hydrous oxides can be calculated by accounting only for mononuclear hydrolysis species. The considerably higher solubilities of amorphous Th(IV) precipitates at pH <5 include major contributions of polynuclear species. The solubility data in acidic solutions depend strongly on the preparation and crystallinity of the solid phase. In neutral and alkaline solutions, where An(OH)(4)(aq) are the predominant aqueous species, the solubilities of AnO(2)(cr) become equal to those of the amorphous solids. This indicates that the crystalline dioxides are covered by amorphous hydroxide layers.

The in-situ measurement allows direct characterization of the supercritical fluid extraction. The extractions were found to be first order with respect to uranium and the distribution coefficient was observed to increase with temperature and tributyl phosphate concentration.

J	Friese, JI; Nash, KL; Jensen, MP; Sullivan, JC				Friese, JI; Nash, KL; Jensen, MP; Sullivan, JC			Interactions of Np(V) and U(VI) with dipicolinic acid	RADIOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						uranium(VI); neptunium(V); dipicolinic acid; kinetics; activation parameters	CHLOROPHOSPHONAZO-III; DIPHOSPHONIC ACIDS; COMPLEXATION; KINETICS; DIOXOURANIUM(VI)	To complement earlier studies of the complexation kinetics of Np(V) and U(VI) by oxydiacetic acid and several diphosphonic acids, the rate of complexation of these metal ions by dipicolinic acid (pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, DPA) has been investigated by stopped-flow spectrophotometry. This ligand is distinguished from the previously studied species by the rigid planar arrangement of the ligand functional groups and the presence of a pyridine nitrogen donor atom. Reactions of DPA with UO22+ at p[H] 1 and NpO2+ at p[H] 1 and 3 adhere to the comparatively simple first-order approach to equilibrium kinetic model used to describe the earlier results. At p[H] 3, the UO22+ reaction is characterized by consecutive pseudo-first order reactions. The first is an apparent approach to equilibrium while the second process demonstrates a saturation effect, indicating the existence of a stable intermediate complex. Relative rates and activation parameters are discussed in comparison with the previous results.
