J	Li, SH; Jen, CP				Li, SH; Jen, CP			Modeling of hydrodynamic chromatography for colloid migration in fractured rock	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							TRANSPORT; PARTICLES; SPHERES; WATER; FLOWS	The role of colloids in the migration of radionuclides in the geosphere has been emphasized in the performance assessment of high-level radioactive waste disposal. The literature indicates that the colloid velocity may not be equal to the velocity of groundwater owing to hydrodynamic chromatography. A theoretical model for hydrodynamic chromatography of colloid migration in the fracture is proposed in the present work. In this model, the colloids are treated as nonreactive and the external forces acting on colloidal particles are considered including the inertial force, the van der Waals attractive force, and the electrical double-layer repulsive force, as well as the gravitational force, A fully developed concentration profile for colloids is obtained to elucidate migration behavior for colloids in the fracture. The effects of parameters governing these forces and the aperture of the fracture are determined using a theoretical model.

North-eastern region being in a zone of high seismicity, the indoor radon and thoron map of the region will provide a valuable database for any study related to radon and thoron anomalies. Radon enters living area mainly through floor from subsoil and building materials, and starts accumulating in poorly ventilated dwellings. So, concentration of radon and its progeny are usually higher in indoor air than in outdoor air. In the present work, an attempt has been made to assess the levels of radon, thoron and their progeny in dwellings of a few cities in the north-eastern region of India using a passive time integrated monitoring with the help of twin chamber dosimeters having LR-115 as the detector.

For these purposes, the small pieces of sample were separated by sodium polytungstate heavy liquid separation method. An alpha -liquid scintillation counting method combined with time interval analysis applied to the simultaneous determination of the U- and Th-series members, while K-40 was determined by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The analytical results were compared with the radioactive contents from the gamma -spectrometry, and gave a good agreement. In addition, the natural red thermoluminescence glowcurve from quartz separated was consistent with the result from a conventional quartz inclusion procedure. The possibility of practical TL-dating using a smaller sample, approximately 1 g, was ascertained. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The experiment used 320 MeV protons incident on a deuterium cluster-jet target. The spectator protons were detected inside the scattering chamber using a silicon detector system which is compatible with a high vacuum. The low target density allows the spectator proton emerge without undergoing significant secondary scattering. Its measurement is therefore a useful tag upon such reactions, allowing cross-sections for quasi-free reactions to be deduced at well-defined centre-of-mass energies. The comparison with the simulation for the pd --> d pi (0)p(s) reaction shows that the energy dependence of the pn --> d pi (0) cross-section can be extracted near the threshold. The method greatly improves the experimental resolution achievable in quasi-free p-n reaction studies. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The data were taken at the H2 and H4 beamlines at CERN in 1995 and 1996. The prototype sampling calorimeter used copper absorber plates and scintillator tiles with wavelength shifting fibers for readout. The effects of a magnetic field of up to 3 T on the response of the calorimeter to muons, electrons, and pions are presented, and the effects of an upstream lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter on the linearity and energy resolution of the combined calorimetric system to hadrons are evaluated. The results are compared with Monte Carlo simulations and are used to optimize the choice of total absorber depth, sampling frequency, and longitudinal readout segmentation.

This article examines how the different adjustment codes such as SANDBP, MSANDB, MSITER and MIEKEB do modification to the input spectrum and how this in turn affects the solution spectrum and the integral parameters. The effects of normalisation factor, weighting spectrum, group structure and treatment of inconsistencies on the solution spectrum have also been studied. The results obtained by the above adjustment codes have been compared and the criteria for selecting a solution spectrum from the many possible adjusted spectra have also been discussed.

J	Waris, A; Sekimoto, H				Waris, A; Sekimoto, H			Basic study on characteristics of some important equilibrium fuel cycles of PWR	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			Russian	Article							NUCLEAR	Equilibrium fuel cycle characteristics of a light water reactor (LWR) with enriched uranium supply were evaluated. In this study, five kinds of fuel cycles of 3000 MWt pressurized water reactor (PWR) were investigated, and a method to determine the uranium enrichment in order to achieve their criticality was presented. The results show that the enrichment decreases considerably with increasing number of confined heavy nuclides when U is discharged from the reactor. The required natural uranium was also evaluated for two different enrichment processes. The amount of required natural uranium also decreases as well. On the other hand, when U is totally confined, the enrichment becomes unacceptably high. Furthermore, Pu and minor actinides (MA) confining seem effective to incinerate the discharged radio-toxic wastes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The program was developed under the framework of CANDU physics design and analysis code RFSP, The generalized perturbation method was implemented to estimate the power distribution in conjunction with the zone controller level. The numerical algorithm of the generalized perturbation method was verified by a simple 2x2 node problem. The capability of predicting the zone controller level was validated for a CANDU-6 reactor refueling problem. GENOVA is compatible with the current CANDU physics design code and, therefore, it can be used for advanced CANDU core analysis and fuel development in the future.

A stimulus-response technique with (NH4Br)-Br-82 as a tracer was used to measure the above parameters. Experiments were carried out at three different flow rates, i.e 1.0, 0.64 and 0.33 m(3)/min. Three combined models based on a set of differential equations are proposed and used to simulate the measured tracer concentration curves. The obtained parameters were used to estimate dead volume and analyse hydrodynamic behaviour of the irradiator. The nonlinear regression problem of model parameter estimation was solved using the Marquardt-Levenberg method. The measured flow rate was found to be in good agreement with the values shown by the flow meter. The circulation times were found to be half of the mixing times. A simple approach for estimation of dose based on a known vertical dose-rate profile inside the irradiator is presented. About one-fourth of the volume of the irradiator was found to be dead at lower flow rates and this decreased with increase in flow rate. At higher flow rates, a semi stagnant volume was found with slow exchange of flow between the active and dead volumes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Emslie, AG; Banish, RM				Emslie, AG; Banish, RM			The effects of collimator geometry and self-absorption on in-situ mass diffusion measurements	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article								We consider a real-time methodology for determining self-diffusion coefficients at several temperatures utilizing a single sample, based on a radiotracer technique put forth by Codastefano, Di Zanza and Russo (Codastefano, P., Di Russo, A., Zanza, V. 1977. A new apparatus for accurate diffusion measurements in fluids. Reviews of Science Instrumentation 48, 1650-1653 (CDZ)) and recently optimized by our group (Jalbert, L.B., Banish, R.M., Rosenberger, F.E. 1997. Real-time diffusivity measurements in liquids at several temperatures with one sample. Physical Review E 57, 1727-1736 (JBR)). In this technique the evolution of the concentration distribution of the radiotracer is followed by shielding the source except for a pair of collimated apertures placed at mathematically advantageous positions along the diffusion axis. Radiation detectors at each collimator measure the intensity of radioactive tracer emission at each aperture, and the counting rate difference versus time leads to a determination of the diffusion coefficient. The effects of self-absorption of radiation in the source were previously treated by us using a one-dimensional approximation, which is a typical procedure. However, in order to obtain meaningful counting statistics in the detectors, the size of the collimator apertures must be large enough that the measured counting rate is actually an integral over a three-dimensional region of the source volume rather than an ideal point measurement. Here we consider, by a ray-tracing algorithm, the effects of this finite extent of the observed volume on the experimentally-determined diffusivity. Self-absorption effects are considered both for photon energies that have essentially no absorption in the sample (so that the entire thickness of the sample is effectively viewed) and for those that suffer sufficient self-absorption that the measured radiation comes from only a surface "skin-depth" (similar to 100 mum in extent). Collimation holes from similar to1 to similar to 100% of the sample diameter are investigated. We find that neither the effects of self-absorption nor of the intrinsic three-dimensional geometry involved have a significant effect on the experimentally determined value of the diffusivity. In addition, linear concentration gradients along the diffusion axis do not influence the diffusivity measurement. A (quadratic) correction formula to determine the actual diffusion coefficient from the experimentally-obtained value is presented. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

We have developed EF5, 2-(2-nitro-1[H]-imidazol-1-yl)-N-(2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropyl)-acetamide, with both invasive and non-invasive hypoxia detection in mind. EF5 and other 2-nitroimidazoles are used to detect hypoxia, because the rate of their bioreductive metabolism is inversely dependent on oxygen partial pressure. Such metabolism leads to the formation of covalent adducts within the metabolizing cells. Previously, we have described the invasive detection of these adducts by highly specific monoclonal antibodies after tissue biopsy. In this report, we demonstrate the synthesis of F-18-labeled EF5, [F-18]-2-(2-nitro-1 [H]-imidazol-1-yl)-N-(2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropyl)-acetamide, in greater than 10% yield by direct fluorination of the newly synthesized precursor 2-(2-nitro-1[H]-imidazol-1-yl)- N-(2,3,3-trifluoroallyl)-acetamide by [F-18]-F-2 in trifluoroacetic acid. Our objective was to optimize the electrophilic fluorination of the fluorinated alkene bond with fluorine gas, a new method of F-18-labeling of polyfluorinated molecules. Previous biodistribution studies in mice have demonstrated uniform access of EF5 to all tissues with bioelimination dominated by renal excretion. When [F-18]-EF5 was injected into a rat followed by urine collection and analysis, we found no detectable metabolism to other radioactive compounds. Thus, [F-18]-EF5 should be well suited for use as a non-invasive hypoxia marker with detection using positron emission tomography (PET). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Radiochemical purity was greater than 95%. Marker biodistribution was measured in normal Wistar strain rats at different time intervals after intra venous (i.v.) administration. In vivo distribution and scintigraphic imaging studies were performed after i.v. injection into mammary tumor-bearing rats using a gamma camera and associated computer. Intratumor partial oxygen pressure (pO(2)) and oxygen saturation measurements were performed to estimate the oxygenation status of the tumors. Tumor to muscle ratio (T/M) of Tc-99m-cyclam AK 2123 was 8.5 which was compared with other tumor seeking radiopharmaceuticals, viz. Tc-99m-(V) DMSA (3.07), Tc-99m-citrate (5.29) and (201)T1C1 (3.29). T/M ratios were also evaluated in comparison with radioiodinated iodoazomycin galactopyronoside (I-125-IAZG). The ratio obtained was 18 for Tc-99m-cyclam AK 2123 and 20 for I-125-IAZG, respectively. The increased concentration of radioactivity in these tumors suggests that this agent could be labelling hypoxic cells and have utility as an imaging agent. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Since disclosure for previous continuous contamination, a series of urine samples were collected from this individual weekly for a period of > 2 months. P-32 radioactivity in urine samples were measured by the acid precipitation method. Estimation for retrospective total effective dose equivalent received by this subject was conducted for cumulative internal dose estimation. A minimum of 9.4 mSv was estimated for an assumed single ingestion. As this was a rare case in radiation protection and internal radiation dosimetry, its implications were of considerable significance. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is a first step in a study of the mobilization of uranium and thorium series and its: relation to surface hydrology, in a region vr here carbonate deposits are bring continuously dissolved and reprecipitated. The obtained results show that all these deposits are characterized by very low concentrations of uranium and thorium, The U-238/Ra-226 and Th-228/Ra-228 activity ratios are significantly different than 1.0, indicating that both series are in radioactive disequilibrium. Although the Serra da Bodoquena deposits seem to be very recent, their very fine granulation and high porosity suggest that they behave as open systems for geochemical exchanges of uranium and thorium series members, The Pantanal do Miranda limestone has a radiocarbon age of 3900 yr BF. Since the thorium series is in disequilibrium it is also concluded that this deposit behaves as an open system for geochemical exchanges. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd, All rights reserved.

The formulation of the explosion problem takes account of the interaction of the gas with finely, dispersed water particles, including mass, momentum, and energy transfer (due to phase transformations of the water), aerodynamic drag forces, and com,ecrh,e heat transfer The problem is solved using the nonstationary method of large particles, modified by introducing a flow-correction step.

J	Birkhofer, A				Birkhofer, A			Safety philosophy and safety standards in nuclear law a comparative assessment	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								From its very inception, the peaceful use of nuclear power was accompanied by the forceful development of a safety philosophy and of safety standards which, in many ways, have model character for the entire field of technology. Against the finding that absolute safety will never be attainable (a law of nature), the yardsticks developed were based on the principle of caution so as to contain considerable safety margins even under pessimistic assumptions and remote possibilities of failure. In this way the main goal, i.e. the protection of persons and of the environment, can be ensured in a concept relying on stable reactor physics design and on the containment of radioactive inventories. Common approaches and common safety standards, partly with different solutions, have developed in the Western industrialized countries, with the broad acceptance of light water reactor technology providing a sound technical basis. In addition, a safety philosophy has become established in individual countries which, by continuous further development and through the inclusion of current findings and experiences, though practiced differently in each case, helps to advance safety in the future, and supports the process of turning safety approaches into dynamic propositions. In principle, the concepts and standards underlying safety are very similar in the industrialized countries, but differ considerably in matters of detail as a consequence of different technical and industrial cultures. Given the international importance of the safety of nuclear installations, there is a keen interest in unifying standards at a high level. At present, chances are good to achieve a broad consensus. Europe as a region with the largest number of nuclear power plants in operation should play an important role in this effort and should use this opportunity, because of its traditional high safety-mindedness, by introducing best practices.

J	Domaratzki, Z				Domaratzki, Z			National and international standards: Creation and mutual influence	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			English	Article								The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is empowered in its statute to elaborate safety standards for the sectors of nuclear power utilization and for the development and application of nuclear technologies in order to protect human lives and the environment and to minimize risk. It may apply these standards to its own activities and make them available to interested countries. Although existing standards are not binding upon the member states of IAEA, they are taken into account in national legislation and national regulations to different extents. Moreover, IAEA safety standards have achieved increasing significance in the past few years as a result of their serving as a basis for international agreements. On the way towards a standardized international agreement on safety standards for nuclear facilities, the "Convention on Nuclear Safety" adopted in 1994 and entered into force in 1996 has achieved model character. On the basis of the experience accumulated with that Safety Convention, the "Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management" is to become as important to the sector of radioactive materials management. Worldwide progress in the development of comprehensive, internationally acknowledged safety standards not only can help to derive gains in safety from the common background of experience, and to advance joint developments, but also can be instrumental in boosting confidence in nuclear technology worldwide.

J	[Anonymous]				[Anonymous]			Position paper on main areas of nuclear chemistry research and application	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								Nuclear chemistry, with its specialized areas of nuclear chemistry, radiochemistry, and radiation chemistry, mainly covers these fields: basic research in nuclear chemistry; actinide chemistry; radioanalysis; nuclear chemistry in the life sciences, geosciences, and cosmic chemistry; radiotracers in technology; nuclear power technology; nuclear waste management; tritium chemistry in fusion technology, and radiation protection and radioecology. In the more than one hundred years of history of this branch of science and technology, which was opened up by the discovery of radioactivity and of the radioelements, pioneering discoveries and developments have been made in many sectors. Far beyond the confines of this area of work, they have achieved overriding importance in applications in many fields of technology and industry and in the life sciences. Research and application in nuclear chemistry continue to be highly relevant to society, ecology, and the economy, and the potential of science and technology in this field in Germany is acknowledged internationally. In the light of this vast area of activity, and against the need to maintain competence in nuclear chemistry for the use of nuclear power, irrespective of the status of this continued use in Germany, nuclear chemistry is indispensable to the solution of future problems. The Nuclear Chemistry Group of the Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker therefore uses this position paper to draw attention to the urgent need to keep up and further advance nuclear chemistry applications in a variety of areas of science and technology, also as a public duty of thorough education and research.									0	0	0	0	0	VERLAGSGRP HANDELSBLATT GMBH	DUSSELDORF	POSTFACH 10 11 02, D-40002 DUSSELDORF, GERMANY	1431-5254			ATW-INT Z KERNENERG	ATW-Int.

J	Kessler, G; Gompper, K; Broeders, C; Kiefhaber, E				Kessler, G; Gompper, K; Broeders, C; Kiefhaber, E			Modem strategies of plutonium disposal	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								Plutonium isotopes (Pu-239 and higher isotopes) are produced in the light water reactors currently prevailing out of the natural uranium isotope, U-238, as a result of neutron capture and other nuclear processes. Because of the halflife of 24,110 years of the Pu-239 isotope generated, its radiotoxicity as an alpha emitter, and its weapon capability, plutonium has always been a topic of public debate. Approximately 222,000 t of spent nuclear fuel have so far accumulated in nuclear power plants worldwide. Some 9500 t are added each year. The cumulated amount of plutonium produced in this process amounts to some 1400 t, and is increased annually by some 70 t as a result of ongoing plant operation. Moreover, even larger quantities of plutonium are still held in the nuclear weapon arsenals of the nuclear weapon states. The United States and Russia agreed, within the framework of disarmament initiatives in the nineties, to transfer 50 t of Pu each to civilian uses. There are two basic options of plutonium management: permanent direct disposal of the spent fuel elements, or use for further energy generation by way of reprocessing and the fabrication of mixed oxide (MOX) fuel. For the time being, a number of countries have decided in favor of direct disposal, while others have opted for the further use of plutonium in a closed fuel cycle. Because of the fissile material content in spent nuclear fuel, the storage facilities used for direct disposal need to be put under long-term surveillance. This is why scenarios are developed to ensure long-term minimization of the accumulated amounts of plutonium, while continuing to use nuclear power, by recycling plutonium into the process of energy generation in special reactors (such as the CAPRA reactor or ADS systems) connected to power reactors. Establishing such a system of light water reactors and plutonium burners requires as a prerequisite a closed nuclear fuel cycle and advanced reactor systems for the plutonium burners.

The site tritium inventory was 20 g, and this was recycled several times using the active gas handling system (AGHS) to recover tritium from mixed exhaust gases. The amount of tritium available for use at any time was determined by the hold-up in the in-vessel components, in-process inventory, and losses via permeation and transfer to waste. It was therefore necessary, to continually assess the tritium inventory through on-line and batch measurements. During the shutdown periods, tritium continued to be evolved from the machine and its trapped volumes. This meant that a large number of specific measurements were necessary to ensure that the safety requirements were met and that the waste could be properly characterised. During DD operations, the exhaust gas from the machine contained quantities of tritium, too great to be discharged to atmosphere and must continue to be processed by the AGHS. The techniques for tritium inventory assessment are reviewed, taking into account continuing uncertainties and plans for resolutions of these. The JET experiment is used to highlight issues of tritium inventory control, which will apply to future fusion reactors. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Since a tritium release to the environment can create a significant public hazard, the safety and reliability of tritium systems is very important for fusion research experiments and future power plants. Probabilistic safety assessment techniques are used to evaluate the safety of tritium handling. A foundation for meaningful probabilistic safety assessment is the application of accurate component failure rate data. The component failure rate values discussed here have been calculated and analyzed from fusion research facilities, the US Tritium Systems Test Assembly and Japan's Tritium Process Laboratory. The generic failure rate data compared in this paper were taken from published sources in US and Canada. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All-rights reserved.

The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor-Fusion Power Shutdown System (ITER-FPSS) was the system selected for the application because of its fusion-specific character. The performed application substantially confirms the level of safety importance classification (SIC) assigned to the FPSS by the ITER team (SIC level 3). A set of safety requirements, concerning aspects of reliability and performance, has been defined for the FPSS. These requirements integrate and specify, for the FPSS, the generic implications currently imposed by the ITER team on the safety systems classified SIC-3. Some FPSS design specifications are also suggested to address the burden of proof requested to justify that its safety requirements can be met by the design and can be maintained over the life-time of ITER.

J	Iseli, M				Iseli, M			In-vessel hydrogen deflagration and detonation in ITER-FEAT	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th IAEA Technical Committee Meeting on Fusion Power Plant Safety	JUN 13-16, 2000	CANNES, FRANCE	Int Atom Energy Agcy		international thermonuclear experimental reactors; hydrogen-air mixtures; deflagration and detonation		Hydrogen-air mixtures in the vacuum vessel of international thermonuclear experimental reactors (ITER) may be produced by accidents. The basic safety approach is to limit the amount of hydrogen to keep concentrations below flammability limit. For ITER, 5-kg hydrogen uniformly mixed in the vacuum vessel with air at 1.0 bar would lead to concentrations below the flammability limit of 4 vol.%. However, in the case of air ingress into a hydrogen-containing vessel, the hydrogen concentration unavoidably passes through the flammability and detonability range. Also the local formation of burnable clouds is of concern. The problem is to determine the amount of hydrogen allowed to deflagrate or detonate in the vessel without impairing the radioactive confinement function of the vessel and its secondary enclosures. First, the vacuum vessel has to withstand the static load of a deflagration, which pressurizes the vessel for a substantial time period. The final adiabatic pressure after detonation is practically equal to the deflagration pressure because there is only a small difference in burn completeness. Second, in case of a detonation, the vessel has to withstand the dynamic load of the high peak pressure of very short duration during reflection of the detonation wave at the vessel wall. To determine the static load, the maximum deflagration pressures during air ingress transients are evaluated for completely mixed gases and local clouds of flammable mixtures. To characterize the dynamic load, a model for the momentum transferred to the wall by a reflected detonation wave is developed. It results in the simple rule, that the momentum of the wave is at maximum 13% of the total theoretical momentum defined by the total mass of gas in the vessel moving with the Chapman-Jouguet (C-J) detonation front velocity [A.H. Shapiro, The Dynamics and Thermodynamics of Compressible Fluid Flow, vol, 1, Ronald Press, 1953, p. 210]. The momentum transferred to the wall is about twice the momentum of the impacting wave due to reflection on the wall. The results for the ITER limit of 5 kg show a maximum deflagration pressure below the 2 bar design limit of the vessel and a detonation momentum, which is within comparable design loads of the vessel and its support structure, such as for the dropping of a blanket module from top of the vessel to the bottom.

In particular, changes of hydrogen isotope inventory in co-deposited layers on tungsten and graphite under simulation of normal tokamak operation and plasma disruptions are reported. Size distribution of graphite and W-Be-dust under the experiments at issue revealed two maximums. Erosion products were collected within tokamak T-IO. Their microstructure and chemical composition were studied and are reported in the paper. Chemical interaction of beryllium powder with steam (in temperature range of 400-600 degreesC) and air (at 500-1000 degreesC) was investigated. Mathematical models describing it were developed. Chemical interaction of Be-powder with carbon was studied too. A dependence of beryllium carbide layer thickness growth versus time at 950 degreesC was found on the basis of the experiments.

Current experience in the nuclear industry, and at operating tokamaks confirm that a high level of occupational safety can be achieved through an effective planning process. For fusion facilities with increased hazard levels resulting from the introduction of large quantities of tritium, and higher neutron flux and fluence, a process must be implemented during the design phase to address both the worker safety and the regulatory requirements. Such a process has been developed and was used for the radiological occupational safety assessment of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). The purpose of this paper is to describe the approach used, including, the implementation of the as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) principle for individual and collective doses in an evolving design, and the demonstration of adequate radiological occupational safety during the design process.

Safety design approach and implementation are focused on inherent and high-level passive safety features of the ITER-FEAT. By such features, escalation of abnormal condition to accident can be prevented without any special countermeasures such as emergency plasma shutdown system. As a result, the primary containment system and the secondary confinement one are proposed to achieve the ITER safety objectives. To establish the structural design codes for unique ITER components, an ad-hoc technical committee has been organized. The designs of the Vacuum vessel and tritium process components have been reviewed and discussed. Recommendations including some attractive methodologies for structural design and components examinations, taking into account a low level of hazard potential and unique safety features of ITER was given by the committee. Another ad-hoc technical committee under JAERI Construction Division is discussing the design codes for ITER seismic isolation. The current status of R&D activities ongoing in JAERI for accumulation of experimental data required for assurance of the safety analysis and design codes for ITER are also reviewed.

One of the principal objectives of the present studies is the establishment of simulation method to predict the tritium behavior after the tritium leak accident should happen in a ventilated room. As for the understanding of initial tritium behavior until the tritium concentration become steady, the precise estimation of local flow rate in a room and time-dependent release behavior from the leak point are essential to predict the tritium behavior by simulation code. The three-dimensional eddy flow model considering, tritium-related phenomena was adopted to estimate the local flow rate in the 50 m(3)/h ventilated Caisson. The time-dependent tritium release behavior from the sample container was calculated by residence time distribution function. The calculated tritium concentrations were in good agreement with the experimental observations. The primary removal tritium behavior was also investigated by another code. Tritium gas concentrations decreased logarithmically to the time by ventilation. These observations were understandable by the reason that the flow in the ventilated Caisson was regarded as the perfectly mixing flow. The concentrations of tritiated water measured, and indications of tritium concentration by tritium monitors became gradually flat. This phenomena called 'tritium soaking effect' was found to be reasonably explained by considering the contribution of the exhaustion velocity by ventilation system, and the adsorption and desorption reaction rate of tritiated water on the wall material which is SUS 304. The calculated tritium concentrations were in good agreement with the experimental observations. The effectiveness of these codes was thus proved. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Its role is to detritiate the exhaust gases in case of an accident and to minimise the tritium release to the environment. EDS has also been used on JET during the last 3 years for maintenance purposes. During the main phase of the deuterium-tritium experiment (DTE1), the EDS was the final stage for detritiation of gases coming from the Torus vessel. There is a regulatory requirement to prepare an 'Engineering Substantation' of key safety related systems. Although this requirement applies to EDS when dealing with accidental tritium releases, it has been possible to investigate the efficiency of the system by analysing the experimental data obtained during maintenance. In 2000, during the shutdown, campaign measurements on EDS have been performed to determine its efficiency on a daily basis. Detritiation factors (DF) range between 20 and 80 000. Results are presented and discussed in relation to the requirements of the JET safety case and the factors, which cause apparent low DFs. An enhancement of the system for tritium control tracking is proposed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We have classified DBEs into three categories considering their occurrence probabilities and expected scales of their consequences. By the GEMSAFE methodology applied to the ITER final design, we have selected 21 DBEs, eight in category I, eight in category II, and five in Category III. Here, we have focused on the following characteristics of the final design of ITER EDA of 1998. The amount of mobile radioactive materials, or RI sources, in the front-end permeator of the fuel gas purification system was largely increased to 70 g, cf. 15 g in an earlier EDA design. Though it does not change the class of the related DBE, the consequence by the related abnormal event would be more severe. The inventories of tritium in the impurity detritiation system, and that in surge tanks were not decreased, namely, still exceeding the limit of the class-1 RI source (i.e., 10(5) Ci). As for the radioactive dusts, their inventory increased. However, we need not modify the DBEs so long as we categorize the radioactive dust as immobile RI source. The mobility of the dust is a matter of further detailed examination. If we would find the dust is a mobile-RI-source category, it might challenge the baseline to fit the equi-risk curve. Further discussions are necessary for the characteristics of the dusts, and the safety measures to reduce the inventory during operations. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Sillen, X; Marivoet, J; Zucchetti, M				Sillen, X; Marivoet, J; Zucchetti, M			Analysis of human intrusion scenarios for the deep disposal of fusion wastes	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th IAEA Technical Committee Meeting on Fusion Power Plant Safety	JUN 13-16, 2000	CANNES, FRANCE	Int Atom Energy Agcy		ITER fusion reactor; SEAFP; fusion plant Model PM-2		During the development of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) fusion reactor, many efforts are done to minimise the amount of radioactive waste that will arise from the decommissioning of a nuclear fusion power plant. Nevertheless, the most active waste types will have to be disposed in a repository. The impact of possible future human actions on the performance of the repository has to be evaluated. The most active waste types are selected from the inventory of fusion plant model PM-2 with low-activation martensitic steel as main material. After a cooling period of 100 years, the fusion waste is assumed to be disposed off in a repository located in the boom clay layer at the Mol site (Belgium). A systematic approach for the identification of the relevant intrusion scenarios is applied. Three scenarios resulting from borehole drilling are identified as relevant, core inspection, residence and unsealed borehole. This paper will focus on the analysis of the most drastic human intrusion scenario, i.e. the core inspection scenario. The maximum dose is calculated for waste arising from Be-coatings. In the case of a routine inspection, the dose to a geological worker is always under 0.5 Sv. This value, under which serious deterministic health effects are unlikely, can be considered as a reference level for acute exposure. In the case of the very pessimistic close inspection variant a maximum dose of 0.4 Sv is calculated if the intrusion occurs immediately after the disposal. After 60 000 years, the dose becomes lower than 3.5 mSv, which is the average annual background dose. The results of an alternative approach, considering a fusion-specific repository and wells drilling as the main intrusion scenario, are also included in this paper. Finally, a comparison of the consequences due to intrusion scenarios calculated for fusion and fission waste is presented. For the most active fission waste types it lasts 1 million years before the close inspection dose drops under 0.5 Sv. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hartley, BM				Hartley, BM			The measurement of radiation levels in Australian zircon milling plants	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						exposure, occupational; dose assessment; inhalation; naturally occurring radionuclides	TILES	The processing of zircon often involves grinding it to a fine powder known as zircon flour, As the resulting particles are small they may be inhaled if they become airborne and, since they contain some uranium and thorium, deliver radiation doses to workers. Theoretical estimates and measured radiation exposure in Australian zircon milling plants are reported in this paper. Theoretical doses, calculated in this work, indicate a potential maximum dose to workers of 5.5 mSv y(-1). Measured doses, based on normal work practices, vary in different plants from 0.66 mSv to 1.03 mSv y(-1) and suggest that in the dustiest Australian zircon milling plants the maximum dose would be of the order of 1 mSv y(-1), Measurements, which focused on the dustiest operations, indicate an upper limit of dose of about 3 mSv y(-1), Based on the theoretical and measured doses not exceeding 6 mSv y(-1), workers would not be designated as Category A workers, and probably would not be designated Category B workers, exceeding 1 mSv y(-1) under the guidelines of a EURATOM Directive.

The purpose of this study is to provide baseline data on radiation level and radionuclide distribution in the region for the future assessment of the impact of the nuclear and thermal power stations that are being set up in the region. Further, this study may reveal information on the transportation of radionuclides in the environment. The external gamma dose rates in air have been measured throughout Coastal Karnataka using a sensitive plastic scintillometer. The measured dose rates include both terrestrial and cosmic ray components. The gamma dose rates in air range from 26 to 174 nGy h(-1) with a median value of 74 nGy h(-1). The activities of naturally occurring radionuclides in the soil samples of the region were measured using HPGe gamma ray spectrometry, and the resulting doses in air were calculated. The activity of K-40 varies from 61.0 to 316.7 Bq kg(-1) with a median of 117.5 Bq kg(-1); the activity of Ra-226 varies from 20.1 to 62.3 Bq kg(-1) with a median value 35.0 Bq kg(-1) and that of Th-232 from 14.3 to 48.6 Bq kg(-1) with a median value of 29.8 Bq kg(-1). The mean absorbed dose rate in air due to naturally occurring radionuclides is found to be 41.5 nGy h(-1). In addition to this, the correlations between Ra-226 and K-40, Th-232 and K-40, and Ra-226 and Th-232 were computed from the results of the concentration of these naturally occurring radionuclides. A weak correlation was observed between Ra-226 and K-40 and between Th-232 and K-40 while a moderately good correlation was observed between Ra-226 and Th-232. The results of these systematic investigations are presented and discussed in this paper.

PG piles formed during the last 30 years cover about 1,200 hectares and are located close to the town of Huelva (Spain) on a salt-marsh. The regional government of Andalusia restored the area beginning in 1990 by covering it with a 25-cm-thick layer of natural soil. With this restoration, the external gamma-dose rate in the zone has decreased drastically, approaching near environmental background values. This conclusion is based on results obtained through in-situ monitoring measurements and through a dosimetric model developed for that particular radiation source. As the model uses average parameters of the studied site, its output does not show a correlation point by point with the in-situ monitoring measurements. However, a good agreement is observed in average values over the covered piles. The model gives an average dose rate of 0.41 mGy y(-1) and the in situ monitoring 0.40 mGy y(-1). Based on this model, it is possible to calculate the necessary thickness of soil to reduce the dosimetric contribution from a similar extension of PG until the desired level is reached. In our conditions, in a 25-cm-thick soil, about 0.19 mGy y(-1) is the increase produced by the PG layer in relation to an infinitum soil layer. Consequently, no radiological concern exists in the restored zones with respect to the external gamma radiation.

J	Kramer, GH; Hauck, BM; Allen, SA				Kramer, GH; Hauck, BM; Allen, SA			Chest wall thickness measurements and the dosimetric implications for male workers in the uranium industry	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						exposure, occupational; phantom; lungs, human; annual limit on intake	PU-239; LUNG	The Human Monitoring Laboratory has measured the chest wall thickness and adipose mass fraction of a group of workers at a Canadian uranium refinery, a conversion plant, and a fuel fabrication site using ultrasound. A site-specific biometric equation has been developed for these workers, who seem to be somewhat larger than other workers reported in the literature, Chest wall thickness is a very important modifier on lung counting efficiency and these data have been put into the perspective of the impending Canadian dose limits that will reduce the limit of occupationally exposed workers to 100 mSv in a 5-y period with a maximum of 50 mSv in any one year. The sensitivity of the germanium and phoswich based lung counting systems have been compared. Over a range of chest wall thickness of 1.6 cm to 6.0 cm and using a 30-min counting time, the achievable MDA's lie in the range of 6.7 mg to 19.1 mg or 6.7 mg to 30 mg with a two-phoswich-detector array or a germanium lung counting system, respectively. Depending on chest wall thickness, these achievable MDA's are close to, or exceed, the predicted amounts of natural uranium that will remain in the lung (absorption type M and S) after an intake equivalent to the Annual Limit on Intake that corresponds to 20 mSv, Neither system is sufficiently sensitive to detect an intake of Type S natural uranium in a worker with a chest wall thickness that corresponds to the average (3.73 cm) if it occurred more than 7 d prior to the lung count.
