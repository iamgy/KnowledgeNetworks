The neutron fluxes and displacement damage rates in different materials have been assessed by the McDeLicious code, which simulates the IFMIF neutron source extending up to 55 MeV and uses cross-sections from suitable evaluated libraries for neutron transport. The induced radioactivities and gamma-ray contact dose rates were calculated by the ALARA inventory code on the basis of the IEAF-2001 activation library. The displacement damage rates in steel vary from 60 to 0.004dpa/year and the induced radioactivity after 1 year IFMIF operation 10(15)-10(11) Bq/kg as one moves from the lithium target back plate to the test cell walls. Comparative activation analysis of the SS-316 and Eurofer steels has shown that latter one will have gamma-ray dose rate an order of magnitude less for the cooling period 10-1,000,000 years.

An IFMIF-like white neutron field extending up to energy of 32 MeV was produced at the isochronous cyclotron U-120M of the Nuclear Physics Institute (NPI) Rez, by bombarding a flowing heavy water target with a 37 MeV proton beam. The induced gamma radioactivity for 22 product radio-nuclides was determined by gamma ray spectrometry at different cooling time intervals using calibrated HPGe detectors. Activation calculations were performed with the ALARA inventory code using the activations crosssections from the Intermediate Energy Activation File IEAF-2001. The neutron spectrum at sample sport was combined from one measured at large distance and calculated by MCNPX for energies below the detector threshold. The comparison of calculated and measured induced activities reveals reasonable agreement for half of the detected radio-nuclides and large discrepancies for the other ones. The analysis of the dominant reactions indicates the need for updating the relevant cross-sections in the IEAF-2001 data library. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In both cases, a sharp peak of water species was observed at 680 K due to the decomposition of the LiOD phase. Additionally, two desorption peaks, one corresponding to HDO at 870 K and the other to HD/D-2 at 900 K, were found for the irradiated sample. A comparison with the literature regarding these two desorption peaks at this stage suggested that the former desorption was due to D+ diffusing in the bulk, while the latter was due to D- trapped by the F-0 centers or the deuterium bubbles.

Fusion neutronics source in Japan Atomic Engineering research Association, JAERI/FNS, has started the measurements of the double differential cross-sections (DDXs) and the angular differential cross-sections (ADXs) for the candidate materials of fusion reactors using the collimated D-T neutron beam system and the precise results of the DDXs and ADXs for the (9)Be(n,alpha x) and (9)Be(n,t) reactions have been obtained. Also, from the comparison of the evaluated nuclear data for the beryllium, it was found that the calculated DDX of (9)Be(n,alpha) above about 3 MeV was underestimated and the total (9)Be(n,t) cross-section obtained with the measurement of the DDX and ADX was in good agreement with the evaluated nuclear data. In the following sections, the details of the measurement methods for the charged particles and the obtained DDX and ADX for the beryllium are described. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The ITER facility configuration has been taken as basis for the calculations. In the blanket region reprocessed plutonium and natural uranium oxide were taken as nuclear fuel for neutron/energy multiplication and lithium oxide with beryllium for tritium breeding. The plasma conditions were derived from the JT-60 experience. The neutron analysis has been done with a three-dimensional Monte Carlo code and a point burnup code. As a result, it was found that the proposed FF concept can be operated for at least 5 years with acceptable good performance from the point of view of tritium breeding, sub-criticality, energy multiplication and used for transmutation of long-lived fission products without nuclear fuel exchange and shuffling.

The wet process and direct sol-gel methods are most advantageous from viewpoints of low-cost mass fabrication, reprocessing of lithium-bearing solution and removal of radioactive isotopes. Previously, the target density (80-85% T.D.) of Li2TiO3 pebbles was achieved in the preliminary fabrication test; however, the grain size of Li2TiO3 pebbles was larger than 5 mu m and low sphericity. Therefore, the fabrication tests of Li2TiO3 pebbles by the direct-wet process were continued, focusing the effects on dissolving process of Li2TiO3, dropping of the solution into coagulant and drying/calcinating and sintering processes of the droplet for high sphericity and decreasing the cracks of Li2TiO3 pebble surface.

The mock-ups were irradiated with 14 MeV neutrons from the DT neutron source at FNS. The lithium titanate was enriched to 40 and 95% in Li-6. The local tritium production rate in the 12 mm thick breeding layers was measured by means of pellet detectors of lithium titanate, Li2CO3 and liquid scintillation counting techniques. Additional verification of the neutron spectrum was obtained from material activation such as activation foils. The results were analyzed with the Monte Carlo neutron transport code MCNP-4C and several transport cross section libraries such as FENDL/MC-2.0. The calculation/experiment ratio was found to be within the combined error estimate of calculation and experiment but in some cases, the calculations showed an overestimation tendency.

The delay in the tritium release induced by the MF is proportional to the grain size of the ceramics, the squared MF intensity and the abundance ratio of charged tritium forms (T(+), T(-)) in the grain volume of the ceramics. The effect of MFs of different intensity on the tritium release from the Li(4)SiO(4) pebbles irradiated in the EXOTIC-8 experiment (neutron fluence 2.4 x 10(25) n m(-2), irradiation temperature up to 700 K) was investigated in this study. As a result of the irradiation, the grain size of the ceramics increased from 10-15 to 20-40 mu m, and the T(+) abundance was up to 86%. The effect of a MF of 2.35 T in these pebbles becomes apparent as a delay in the tritium release by 40% at thermoannealing to 1000 K. The results obtained confirm a hypothesis that MFs lengthen the T(+) diffusion path in the grain volume of the ceramics. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In the experiment, the mock-up will be irradiated with a 14-MeV neutron source and the tritium production rate will be measured and compared with the calculated value by neutron cross sections from the European Fusion File. Given the difficulty of performing a reliable measurement of tritium production rate in such experiments, an international benchmark comparison on tritium measurement techniques has been carried out in collaboration between ENEA, TUD/VKTA and also JAERI that has already performed such experiments. The main purpose of the comparison is to establish the reference technique of TPR measurements to be used later in the TBM experiment. Three steps of the comparison procedure are presented in the paper as well as the preliminary results. The implications for the TBM experiment are also discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Transitions from crystalline Li to configurations, having the liquid Li structure's factors ((h) over cap (q)), are simulated ab initio. Once (h) over cap (q) reproduced, He atoms are added, one by one, to the Li system. Parallel lines for each case, with slopes clearly independent on the number of He atoms in the system, are obtained for energy versus pressure at given temperatures. Average differences between two adjacent parallels at zero pressure, once kinetic energy of the system discounted, represents the energy gained by an He atom when added to the Li system, related to the solution energy -H(s). . The molar excess entropy of gas in solution ((S) over bar (ex)(1)) is previously evaluated following diverse fundamental approaches: a "thermodynamic liquid-hole" (TL-H) model for alkali liquids and a statistical-mechanics (Neff & McQuarrie's) model (SMM). Between 600 and 900 degrees C, a typical range of interest for the use of Li in fusion technology, the computed values for the (He) Henry's constant in Li range from 8 x 10(-14) to 10(-13) at. fr.

The difference in hydrogen and deuterium retention behaviour is discussed considering the frequency of the strike-point hit and history of NBI heating power. It was found that most of hydrogen/deuterium was retained in the deposited layers, HH deposition layers/DD deposition layers or co-deposited with carbon. Owing to the higher heating power of DD discharges, the deuterium concentration in the DD deposition layers was much lower than that of hydrogen in the HH deposition layers. On the area showing no deposition, very shallow profile of deuterium dominated hydrogen profile. These results indicate that the tritium retention is strongly influenced by the history of discharge and temperatures. Tritium retention on graphite tiles and deposition layers could be significantly reduced with increasing the operation temperature. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The nuclear energy deposition as well as its spatial distribution, both in radial and poloidal directions, in each blanket module have been calculated. The tritium breeding ratio has been assessed considering different (6)Li enrichments and radial depths of the breeder zone of the blanket and the cases providing tritium self-sufficiency have been identified. The shielding performance of the blanket has been investigated at the inboard torus mid-plane regarding the radiation load to the super-conducting toroidal field coil. Appropriate shield configurations are proposed to ensure the radiation load is below the design limit. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Lead acts as a neutron multiplier and coolant in breeding blanket concepts such as the EU test blanket modules (TBM) with Pb-17Li. Samples of pure Y and Ph were irradiated with D-T fusion neutrons. The radioactivity following irradiation was determined several times during decay by gamma-spectroscopy. The results were analysed with the European Activation System. Ratios of calculated-to-experimental values for individual activities are discussed in connection with the expected activation performance of the materials in fusion power plant conditions.

A diffusion model is used to account for the experimental results. The tritium generation rate was calculated by the Monte Carlo Nuclear Particle code (MCNP-4B) with the nuclear data library ENDF/BV to confirm the validity of an assumption in the model. The calculated results agreed with the experimental values within +/- 10% error. The tritium generation rate in the alloy is almost uniform. It means the assumption of the model is valid.

To improve the TBR, various neutron reflectors are compared, which are graphite, TiC and ZrH(2), and the optimal application of the reflector is investigated, either lumped or layered. The TBR is analyzed as a function of the Li-6 enrichment for the reflected blanket, and the results are used in determining the lifetime of a natural lithium breeder. In addition, various types of moderated shields are assessed to improve the neutron shielding performance. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This will be achieved through testing and qualifying material performance under neutron irradiation that simulates service up to the full lifetime anticipated in the power plant. Preliminary investigations of 14 MeV neutron effects on different kinds of fusion material could be assessed by the SPIRAL 2 Project at GANIL (Caen, France), aiming at rare isotope beams production for nuclear physics research with first beams expected by 2009. In SPIRAL 2, a deuteron beam of 5 mA and 40 MeV interacts with a rotating carbon disk producing high-energy neutrons (in the range between I and 40 MeV) via C (d, xn) reactions. Then, the facility could be used for 3-4 months y(-1) for material irradiation purposes. This would correspond to damage rates in the order of 1-2 dpa y(-1) (in Fe) in a volume of similar to 10 cm(3). Therefore, the use of miniaturized specimens will be essential in order to effectively utilize the available irradiation volume in SPIRAL 2. Sample package irradiation temperature would be in the range of 250-1000 degrees C. The irradiation level of 1-2 dpa y(-1) with 14 MeV neutrons (average energy) may be interesting for micro-structural and metallurgical investigations (e.g., mini-traction, small punch tests, etc.) and possibly for the understanding of specimen size/geometric effects of critical material properties. Due to the small test cell volume, sample in situ experiments are not foreseen. However, sample packages would be, if required, available each month after transfer in a special hot cell on-site.

It was said that "these hazards will be treated according to the industrial safety regulations and practices of the host country". In the framework of studies for the European ITER site in Cadarache, an assessment of fire hazard has been done in order to ensure compliance with French safety requirements.

Ultimate safety margins have also been analysed through hypothetical sequences conservatively extrapolated from the more significant accidents. The rationale for event selection consists firstly of the identification of every radiological source and its confinement barriers; failure of one or several of these barriers may then be presumed and a scenario defined, following a standardized grid; furthermore, the calculations and analysis follow a unique logical scheme to assure consistency and exhaustiveness of the report. Nine accident families have been defined: plasma events, loss of power events, in-vessel events, ex-vessel events, cryostat events, magnet events, maintenance events, tritium plant and fuel events, hot cells events. Calculations with qualified computer codes have shown that the consequences of any postulated accident respect limits defined in the safety guidelines. Moreover, no hypothetical sequence shows any cliff effect, illustrating in this way the robustness of the defence in depth approach used for ITER. It is worth to recall that, in the present status of the ITER project, the only systems subject to the analysis are the tokamak, the tritium plant and the hot cells. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Operation with hundred micrograms of deuterium-tritium will generate high 14 MeV neutron yields that will induce high neutron activation and high doses rates levels in the target chamber area. Previous calculations [Ph. Joyer, M. Dupont, H.P. Jacquet, Safety issues on Laser Megajoule (LMJ) facility, Nucl. Eng. Des. (2003)] have shown relatively high doses rates and the need to reduce activation in the experimental bay. Paths of activation and doses rates reduction were identified. The present paper gives the last results obtained. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Among the findings is the effect of tungsten sputtering by subthreshold energy ions at high temperature, which tends to decrease with irradiation dose. The size distribution of W-erosion products (spherical droplets or flakes) depends on the positioning of the collector. Studies of Be + D(H) films revealed that D/Be ratio in co-deposited Be-D films decreases from 0.15 at 375 K to 0.05 at 575 K. Hydrogen concentration in Be + C films, exposed to acetylene ion flux at 670 K, decreased from 20-24 to 6 at.% with increase in irradiation dose from 10(23) to 10(24) m(-2). The analysis of spectroscopic characteristics of C-D films deposited inside the T-10 tokamak vacuum chamber provides qualitative insight into the physical and chemical reasons behind the preferential retention of the heavier hydrogen isotope in the tokamak erosion films. An extraction scheme for radiochemical reprocessing of activated V-Cr-Ti alloy after a fusion reactor decommissioning was developed and checked experimentally. It takes 48 extraction steps to recover V, Cr and Ti down to an effective dose rate < 12.5 mu Sv/h, permitting the refabrication of these metals without any biological shielding from ionizing radiation.

J	Fasel, D; Tran, MQ				Fasel, D; Tran, MQ			Availability of lithium in the context of future D-T fusion reactors	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	23rd Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT 23)	SEP 20-24, 2004	Venice, ITALY			fusion reactor; breeder blanket; lithium		A future fusion reactor will use deuterium and tritium as fuel. The former is found in abundance in seawater, while the latter is not available naturally due to its short lifetime. Present developments in the context of fusion propose generating tritium in a blanket based on the reaction n + (6)Li -> T + He. This paper will review the issue of the reserves and resources of lithium as the fuel for fusion energy. We describe the available reserves and resources and their chemical forms. We analyze the present production and consumption for industrial uses, completing this over-view by referring to a life cycle analysis in the case of the lithium production from brine. The lithium extraction from seawater is also described. Taking into account the previous data and the requirements estimated for fusion plants, we propose scenarios for future lithium consumption, and we conclude on the lithium availability over the next centuries dealing with the different hypothesis considered.

J	Di Pace, L; Patel, B				Di Pace, L; Patel, B			Factors affecting the inhalation dose from tritiated dust and flakes	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	23rd Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT 23)	SEP 20-24, 2004	Venice, ITALY			Tokamak dust; tritiated dust; inhalation dose	TRITIDE PARTICLES; RESPIRATORY-TRACT; MODEL; LUNG	Tritiated dust and flakes were produced in JET during D-T campaigns. Measurements showed some atypical radiological effects; a very large T concentration and off-gas rate. A higher dose per unit intake was foreseen and it is a consequence of the particulate nature of the material and of the expected longer biological retention. Particle size plays an important role in the deposition pattern in the human respiratory tract. Larger particles are mostly deposited in the anterior nasal passage and remaining airways of the head and neck and removed in less than I day. Smaller particles are mostly retained in the bronchial and bronchiolar regions and alveoli and cleared in longer periods (up to 1 year). The only clearing mechanism of tritium in the latter case is its absorption into lung fluid, an important phenomenon which can be reproduced by in vitro tests to determine doses and dose conversion factors. Based on a review of initial in vitro tests performed on JET dust and from a literature study related to in vitro dissolution experiments, some recommendations for next in vitro experiments on JET dust were formulated.

Accordingly, the worker dose experience from TFTR was of particular interest, not only because of the machine size, but also because of its D/T operation and because it saw the complete cycle of the plant life, including the decommissioning phase. The TFTR ORE experience was reviewed using a systematic approach similar to that used for JET. The worker dose data was reviewed on the basis of available documentation with the aim of identifying trends and relationships that would be useful for future fusion machine ORE estimates. The analysis has yielded some useful results and findings. The first finding is that the machine was shutdown, on an average, about 60% of the year. The second finding is that the ratio of exposed workers to monitored workers was about one-fifth. The third finding is that although, the major portion of worker dose was accrued by maintenance workers during shutdown periods, a significant portion (up to 20%) could have been accrued by non-maintenance work groups during operating periods (excluding plasma operation). Finally, after several years of machine operation with D/T plasmas, there is sufficient information to indicate that tritium doses did not contribute significantly to the total worker dose.

The need for occupational radiation exposure (ORE) experience was the motivating factor for the present study, which focused on the JET machine. This study of the JET ORE experience has started to address the above need. Much more needs to be done, however. Although preliminary, the results of this initial study are encouraging [A. Natalizio, M.T. Porfiri, JET ORE Data collection, ENEA Report FUS-TN-SA-SE-R-88, December 2003]. We have found that, on average, the machine was in the shutdown state 44% of the time; while most of the shutdown time was planned for maintenance or modifications, about 18% of the total shutdown time, on average, was due to unplanned machine interventions; it would appear about two thirds of the JET annual dose, on average, was accrued by the maintenance staff; about 15% of the average, annual worker dose was accrued during the machine operating state; annual worker doses were significantly reduced after the implementation of the ALARP policy during the 1997 tritium plasma campaign; the long-term averages of the collective and individual worker doses are low (96 and 0.153 mSv/a); and, on average, since 1997, the tritium dose has been about 2% of the total worker dose.

In the case of severe accidents, the objective is to restrict the radiological consequences to the vicinity of the plant, i.e., to avoid early and late countermeasures such as evacuation or relocation of the population, and to restrict food banning to small areas and the first year after the accident. Within the European Fusion Technology Programme, a methodology is being developed in compliance with these European Utility Requirements, to define design requirements for future fusion reactors. First results are presented. Concerning food banning, calculations revealed extremely conservative values for tritium in EU regulations and recommendations. This does not affect assessments for fission reactors, but is an overestimation of the tritium dose impact from ingestion. Therefore, in compliance with scientific justification, considerably higher maximum permissible activity levels for tritium should be considered. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

One base case and two parameter studies are performed. The calculations are performed with the fusion MELCOR code. The initiating event, for all three analyses, is a double-ended pipe break in the DV cooling loop, which is postulated to occur in a large diameter pipe at the inlet of the main pump. The break flow is discharged into the Tokamak Cooling Water System (TCWS) vault. This is followed by plasma disruption and a break of the DV heat structure cooling pipes, discharging coolant into the Vacuum Vessel (VV). The results show, that the pressures and temperatures are kept below design limits. The results also show that activated corrosion products (ACP) and tritium are released into the TCWS vault from the coolant water, and that VV dust does not enter into the DV coolant loop, and thus does not reach the TCWS vault.

The materials were divided into different categories according to a classification system for clearance and recycling possibilities of fusion waste: non active waste to be cleared (NAW), simple recycle material (SRM), complex recycle material (CRM) and permanent disposal waste, not recyclable (PDW). The possibilities for disposal of material belonging to the different categories were studied in order to illustrate the options in the case clearance or recycling should be unpractical. Detritiation was assumed for components with high tritium content. (c) 2005 David Murdoch. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The determination to carry out this project in Italy has driven to taking into account several candidate sites. Recently, due to several technical reasons, it was identified a new site, the ENEL-TERNA plant in Rondissone (TO). This paper deals with two main aspects of the Ignitor safety: accident analysis with dose assessment to personnel and public, and radioactive waste management evaluations. Concerning the first point, accidents with a frequency higher than 10(-7) per year bring to a maximum dose for the most exposed individual (MEI) below 1 mSv. We have applied the Italian waste management regulations to the Ignitor experiment radioactive materials: none of them should be classified in the high level waste (HLW) category and most materials are classified as low level waste (LLW). If European proposed waste management strategies were applied, all Ignitor radioactive materials could be recycled. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, non-contaminated materials are currently favoured in order to minimise exploitation constraints. Hence, as it presented low but significant levels of contamination (tritium and beryllium), the LIL target chamber was cleaned up before being installed. A comparison of selected decontamination methods has been made based on their ability to reach very low levels of contamination (i.e. the lowest contamination threshold in transportation regulations and beryllium public limit), their efficiency and compatibility with vacuum objectives. The process was thereby performed at CEA/DAM/Cesta in 2001, using an acid foam technique in a dedicated installation. Its implementation and effectiveness are further discussed in this paper.

The scientific programme on JET over the last 2 years has benefited significantly from various technological developments: advanced real time tools, enhanced heating systems and several upgraded and new diagnostics. JET has also provided more technological input to ITER on questions related to the first wall, divertor and tritium technology. A dedicated Trace Tritium Campaign has delivered a wealth of data on transport and confinement of tritium and alpha particles from the fusion reaction. An enhancement programme is currently underway on JET, consisting of the implementation of an additional set of upgraded and new diagnostics and a further upgrade of the heating systems. This will allow JET to continue to contribute significantly in questions related to the construction and operational phase of ITER. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Grosman, A				Grosman, A		Tore Supra team	High heat flux actively cooled plasma facing components development, realisation and first results in Tore Supra	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	23rd Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT 23)	SEP 20-24, 2004	Venice, ITALY				LONG-PULSE OPERATION; POWER; EXPERIENCE; DISCHARGES; DEPOSITION	The development, design, manufacture and testing of actively cooled high heat flux (HHF) plasma facing components (PFCs) has been an essential part of the Tore Supra programme towards long powerful tokamak operation. The Tore Supra PFC programme has culminated in the installation and operation of a toroidal pump limiter, since 2002, which already allowed to reach new world records in steady state operation (1 GJ injected in a 6 min discharge). The HHF PFCs development and manufacturing was achieved through a long lead development and industrialisation programme (about 10 years) marked out with a number of challenges. The major technical topics cope with bonding technology analysis involving an adequate material selection and procurement, repair processes development and implementation, development of destructive and non-destructive testing methods, and more generally industrialisation assessment. All these lessons are relevant to the ITER divertor PFCs manufacturing, although the technical solution adopted for Tore Supra (flat tiles concept) is different from the one proposed for the ITER divertor (monoblock concept). The routine operation of the actively cooled toroidal pumped limiter (TPL), capable to sustain up to 10 MW m(-2) of nominal convected heat flux, is described. Up to now, the limiter fulfills its objectives in terms of heat exhaust. However, the thermographic monitoring exhibits unexpected behavior of the surface temperature. Particle exhaust control displays a complex pattern, due to the high fraction of the injected deuterium, which remains in the wall. The first experimental results with a full actively cooled wall gives access to ITER relevant information on wall conditioning, hydrogen plasma density and vacuum vessel inventory control, carbon erosion and redeposition and capability of in situ monitoring in a completely actively cooled environment.

The overall heating capability of JET will be increased to 40 MW by upgrading the neutral beam system and building a new ITER-like ion cyclotron radio-frequency heating (ICRH) antenna with particularly stringent specifications. The new divertor will be able to absorb more than 300 MJ per shot and allow running high-triangularity ITER-like scenarios with a greater flexibility with respect to different plasma configurations. The control of extreme plasma shapes will be reinforced and a new disruption mitigation system using a very fast gas valve will be provided. The diagnostic capability will be enhanced by several new systems designed to address a number of crucial physical phenomena for ITER. To study tritium retention further, new technologically challenging erosion-redeposition diagnostics will be installed, particularly in the divertor region, both real time and integrating. New neutron detectors using the latest advances in scintillators and data recording techniques, detectors for fast alpha particles with high pitch angle and energy resolution, high-resolution Thomson scattering, with a 20 Hz repetition rate, which will provide temperature and density profiles with a spatial accuracy close to 2 cm are the leading items of this programme. New halo sensors will be installed to better understand disruption phenomena. New high-signal to noise bolometric tomography and an ambitious IR viewing system using a state of the art camera will also be added. This paper presents an overview, emphasising the main objectives and pointing out the various technological challenges and innovations. (c) 2005 EURATOM/UKAEA. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A current density of 150 A/m(2) (calorimetric) of D- ions has been reached so far in a Cs-seeded discharge with an electron/ion ration of <= 1. The effect of the magnetic filter field on the yield and the electron suppression and possible limitations/improvements are discussed. The neutron production rate is about a factor 40 lower than expected from positive ions. Possible reasons for this are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This can be achieved by cesium evaporation but for operational reasons the consumption of cesium should be minimised. In order to quantify the amount of cesium in the RF discharge optical emission spectroscopy is used as diagnostic tool. Suitable diagnostic lines and their analysis to obtain particle densities and particle fluxes are described.

This paper reports an overview on the present status and the further prospects of the RF source development. Current densities of 26 mA/cm(2) and 15 mA/cm(2) have been achieved for hydrogen and deuterium, respectively, at a pressure of less than 0.5 Pa and an electron/ion ratio of 1. Size scaling experiments indicate a maximum extraction area which can be illuminated by a driver without losses of beam quality and uniformity. The preparation of a test facility for pulse lengths of up to 3600 s is proceeding; commissioning is expected end of 2004. As an intermediate step tests of a large source with the half size of the ITER source are foreseen to be commissioned in 2005. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The two ORNL injectors are now being replaced with JET type Positive Ion Neutral Injectors (PINIs). The MAST PINI design is a modification of the JET high current tetrode injector, with nominal deuterium beam voltage and current of 75 kV and 65 A, respectively. Each injector will deliver up to 2.5 MW of deuterium neutral beam power (in excess of I MW in hydrogen) for pulse lengths of up to 5 s. In addition to the replacement of the two injectors, many other components of the MAST NBI system are being replaced or modified. The various design issues of the upgraded MAST NBI system are addressed. (c) 2005 EURATOM/UKAEA. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The 14 MeV neutron yield was measured with a chemical vapour deposited (CVD) diamond detector. Comparison with the JET 14 MeV monitors (Si diodes) illustrates the good performance of the CVD device. Key information on the tritium transport and the behaviour of fast particles in the plasma was obtained from the spatially and temporally measurements of neutron emission from the upgraded neutron profile cameras which also provide an independent measure of the total neutron yield. Spatial asymmetries in the neutron emission were observed which is evidence for the influence of fast particles on the plasma. With regard to the energy distribution of the neutron emission, a spectrometer based on a liquid organic scintillator with n-gamma pulse shape discrimination (PSD) features was installed. The results demonstrate that such system can operate in real fusion experiments as compact broadband neutron (1.5 MeV < E-n < 20 MeV) spectrometer with high energy resolution. A fast transient recorder has been successfully applied for digital pulse shape discrimination (DPSD) of neutron and gamma events acquired with an organic scintillator at high count rate operation (MHz range). The experience gained at JET indicates that these neutron measurement systems are suitable for large fusion devices such as JET-EP and ITER where fusion neutron diagnostics will play an increasingly important role.

The specimens were used in four conditions to investigate the effect of irradiation-induced defects: standard annealed condition, preirradiated with protons, implanted with helium, and implanted plus annealed to produce helium bubbles. In general, displacement defects as well as implanted helium tend to decrease permeation and diffusivity. Permeation and diffusion measurements were also performed under simultaneous irradiation, showing no net effect if the slight temperature increase due to irradiation is taken into account. Diffusion measurement or implanted hydrogen gave equal or slightly lower values than gas permeation, which is in qualitative agreement with results from preirradiated specimens. Trapping parameters are derived by a detailed comparison to a saturable-trap model. Results are compared to previous studies on 7%Cr F82H and 11%Cr MANET-II steels, and effects of compositional variations are indicated.

This is the first report, to the best of the authors' knowledge, of a D-T layer formed in a permeation-filled sphere. The 2-mm-diam sphere was filled with D-T by permeation; cooled to cryogenic temperatures while in the high-pressure permeation vessel; and, while cold, removed to an optical axis where the D-T was frozen, melted, and beta-layered in a series of experiments over several weeks' time. This work was performed in the Los Alamos National Laboratory cryogenic pressure loader system. The beta-layering time constant was 24.0 +/- 2.5 min, less than the theoretical value of 26.8 min, and not showing the significant increase due to build-up of He-3 often observed in beta-layered samples. Supercooling of the liquid D-T was observed. Neither the polymer target nor its tenting material showed visual signs of degradation after 5 weeks of exposure to D-T. Small external thermal gradients were used to shift the D-T material back and forth within the sphere.

Implosion experiments achieved a maximum yield of 2.11 x 10(11) primary neutrons (70% of the clean one-dimensional yield) with an average areal density of 50 mg/cm(2) with a 1-ns square, high-adiabat (alpha = 25) laser pulse. Lower yields (1 x 10(10) primary neutrons) and higher areal densities (88 mg/cm(2)) were obtained using a lower-adiabat (a = 4) laser pulse. Better performance is expected once smoother ice layers (better than 2-mu m average rms roughness) are positioned within 10 mu m of where the laser beams are pointed. Currently, the offset between the target's location and where the laser beams are pointing at the moment of implosion is 14 to 60 mu m.

This novel model is based on computational calculations applied to the problem of the targets used in Inertial confinement fusion. The model takes into account the influences of the optical imaging system (numerical aperture, source divergence, camera resolution, etc.) and the effect of the capsule itself, diameter, thickness, and refractive index, and allows one to analyze the inner surface of a capsule in terms of thickness and roughness.

J	Poston, JW				Poston, JW			Warren K. Sinclair keynote address: Current challenges in countering radiological terrorism	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	40th Annual Meeting of the National-Council-on-Radiation-Protection-and-Measurements	APR 14-15, 2004	Arlington, VA	Natl Council Radiat Protect & Measurements		National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements; weapons; historical profiles; terrorism		Terrorism, although. perhaps known by other names, is not a new phenomenon. It dates back to Roman times and perhaps even further in world history. Caleb Carr says terrorism "is simply the contemporary name given to, and the modern permutation of, warfare deliberately waged against civilians with the purpose of destroying their will to support either their leaders or policies... " In modern times, in the United States, there have been isolated violent acts of citizens against each other, although these acts often were directed toward symbols of the federal government. In the Middle East and other parts of the world, acts of violence against U.S. citizens and military personnel date back into the early 1960 ' s. Some of these acts seem to be almost random in nature. But these events occurred in distant lands of sometimes uncertain locations to the American public, who soon forgot them and their important message. Even though there had been at least one other attempt on the World Trade Center, it was not until 11 September 2001 that successful, large-scale acts of terrorism came to our shores. In 1998, the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) formed a Scientific Committee and charged the committee with the task of providing a report on the state of preparation and the potential use by terrorists of radiation and radioactivity. The draft report of the Committee was produced a year in advance of the events of 11 September 2001 and was published in its final form about a month after these terrible events. The report brought together, in one place, information that existed in a number of areas, not all of which were easily accessible. However, there were a number of gaps in the information and in the planning and preparation for such events. These were reflected in a series of recommendations for organization, planning, and training, as well as for research and development in a number of areas. This brief presentation will address a few selected areas that remain a challenge for those preparing for terrorist events involving radioactive materials. More detailed discussions will be provided by the presentations at this NCRP Annual Meeting.

Because of recent terrorist activities and intelligence information, there is strong sentiment that it is not a question of if, but when, a radiological or nuclear terrorist attack will occur. As a result, there is considerable concern that the federal government may not be adequately prepared to respond to an attack involving a radiological dispersal device or improvised nuclear device. In response to these concerns, federal departments and agencies have initiated actions to develop a better understanding of the magnitude of the radiological/nuclear terrorist threat, assess the ability of the federal government to support state and local responses to such attacks, and improve the Nation's ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from these types of attacks. In an era of limited fiscal growth and competing priorities, the federal government will have to enhance its collaboration with state and local governments, the private sector, and academia to ensure that the Nation is capable of responding to a terrorist attack involving radioactive or nuclear material.

The accepted generic multiparameter and early-response approach includes measuring radioactivity and monitoring the exposed individual; observing and recording prodromal signs/symptoms and erythema; obtaining complete blood counts with white blood cell differential; sampling blood for the chromosome-aberration cytogenetic bioassay using the "gold standard" dicentric assay (translocation assay for long times after exposure) for dose assessment; bioassay sampling, if appropriate, to determine radioactivity contamination; and using other available dosimetry approaches. In the event of a radiological mass-casualty incident, current national resources need to be enhanced to provide suitable dose assessment and medical triage and diagnoses. This capability should be broadly based and include stockpiling reagents and devices; establishing deployable (i.e., hematology and biodosimetry) laboratories and reference (i.e., cytogenetic biodosimetry, radiation bioassay) laboratories; networking qualified reference radioactivity-counting bioassay laboratories, cytogenetic biodosimetry, and deployable hematology laboratories with the medical responder community and national radiation protection program; and researching efforts to identify novel radiation biomarkers and develop applied biological dosimetry assays monitored with clinical, deployable, and hand-held analytical systems. These research and applied science efforts should ultimately contribute towards approved, regulated biodosimetry devices or diagnostic tests integrated into a national radioprotection program.

J	Becker, SM				Becker, SM			Addressing the psychosocial and communication challenges posed by radiological/nuclear terrorism: Key developments since NCRP Report	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	40th Annual Meeting of the National-Council-on-Radiation-Protection-and-Measurements	APR 14-15, 2004	Arlington, VA	Natl Council Radiat Protect & Measurements		National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements; terrorism; emergency planning; risk communication		One of the most innovative aspects of NCRP Report No. 138 (Management of Terrorist Incidents Involving Radioactive Material) was the high priority it accorded to psychosocial and communication issues. While previous discussions of radiological and nuclear terrorism had occasionally referred to these topics, NCRP Report No. 138 was the first report of its kind to recognize the profound challenges posed by these issues and to place them at the heart of preparedness and response efforts. In the years since the report's release, a host of important developments have taken place in relation to psychosocial and communication issues. This paper reviews key changes and advances in five broad areas: (1) training exercises, (2) policy and guidance development, (3) findings on hospital and clinician needs, (4) survey research on public perceptions of radiological terrorism, and (5) risk communication for radiological and nuclear terrorism situations. The article concludes with a discussion of continuing psychosocial and communication challenges, including critical areas needing further attention as the nation moves to meet the threat of terrorism involving radioactive materials.

J	Dodd, B				Dodd, B			International efforts in countering radiological terrorism	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	40th Annual Meeting of the National-Council-on-Radiation-Protection-and-Measurements	APR 14-15, 2004	Arlington, VA	Natl Council Radiat Protect & Measurements		National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements; terrorism; radioactive materials; weapons		An analysis of the possible goals of terrorists and the means of achieving them leads to an assessment of the most likely target materials and facilities for radiological terrorism. International efforts in countering these terrorist goals cover several objectives. The first is to prevent acquisition of the target radioactive materials, or access to the target facilities. This has to be achieved throughout the life cycle for radioactive sources. The second objective is to detect attempts to acquire, or actual acquisition of, radioactive materials. The third objective is to effectively detect and respond to the use (or threat of use) of these materials, or sabotage of the facilities. An additional goal is to minimize the consequences of any such use or sabotage. The number of international bodies, groups, agencies, and organizations contributing to these goals is very large and almost impossible to catalogue. However, this paper groups the types of efforts that are being undertaken, identifies the key agencies involved, and provides some specific examples of their work.
