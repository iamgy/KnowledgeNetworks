J	Liu, LC; Neretnieks, W				Liu, LC; Neretnieks, W			Analysis of fluid flow and solute transport in a fracture intersecting a canister with variable aperture fractures and arbitrary intersection angles	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						fluid flow; solute transport; fracture	MODEL	A multitude of simulations have been made for different types of rough-walled fractures, by using FEM-LAB((R)), to evaluate the mass transfer to and from water flowing through a fracture with spatially variable apertures and with an arbitrary angle of intersection to a canister that contains spent nuclear fuel. This paper presents and discusses only the results obtained for the Gaussian fractures. The simulations suggest that the intersection angle has only a minor influence on both the volumetric and the equivalent flow rates. The standard deviation of the distribution of the volumetric flow rates of the many realizations increases with increasing roughness and spatial correlation length of the aperture field, and so does that of the equivalent flow rates. The mean of the distribution of the volumetric flow rates is determined, however, solely by the hydraulic aperture, while that of the equivalent flow rates is determined by the mechanical aperture. Based upon the analytical solutions for the parallel plate model, it has been found that the distributions of both the volumetric and the equivalent flow rates are close to the Normal. Thus, two simple expressions can be devised to quantify the stochastic properties of fluid flow and solute transport through spatially variable fractures without making detailed calculations in every fracture intersecting a deposition hole or a tunnel.

Furthermore, a burnup analysis for metal fuel fast breeder reactors (FBRs) is conducted on low-decontamination materials recovered by pyroprocessing. In the case of processing MOX spent fuel (40 GWd/t), UO2 is separately collected for similar to 60 wt% of the spent fuel in advance of the electrochemical reduction step, and the product recovered through the rare earth (RE) removal step, which has the composition uranium:plutonium:minor actinides:fission products (FPs) = 76.4:18.4:1.7:3.5, can be applied as an ingredient of FBR metal fuel without a further decontamination process. On the other hand, the electroreduced alloy of high-burnup UO2 spent fuel (48 GWd/t) requires further decontamination of residual FPs by an additional process such as electrorefining even if RE FPs are removed from the alloy because the recovered plutonium (Pu) is accompanied by almost the same amount of FPs in addition to RE. However, the amount of treated materials in the electrorefining step is reduced to similar to 10 wt% of the total spent fuel owing to the prior UO2 recovery step. These results reveal that the application of electrochemical reduction technology to LWR spent oxide fuel is a promising concept for providing FBR metal fuel by a rationalized process.

The cause was traced to the sintering process, wherein carbon, a degradation product of the die wall or admixed lubricant, was retained in the compact as a result of inadvertent reversal of gas flow in the sintering furnace. In the presence of carbon, the uranium dioxide reacted with nitrogen from the furnace atmosphere to form nitride. The compacts with high nitrogen were also those with low sintered density, arising from low green density. The low green density was due to filling problems of an inhomogeneous powder. The experiments carried out establish the causes of high nitrogen to be the carbon residue from lubricant when the UO2 is sintered in a cracked ammonia atmosphere.

The two main conditions for high-quality neutron imaging-radiography, tomography and especially for neutron phase contrast imaging-are a high beam collimation and a sufficiently high neutron flux. In order to obtain as many cold neutrons as possible from the source, neutron guides are normally used. We have examined whether guides in the accessible parts of the beam channel for CNR could enhance the performance of the instrument. Our findings are (1) that the enhanced divergence provided by the guide is not matched to the collimation or L/D ratio planned for the instrument and (2) the extended image size provided by the guide is not homogeneously illuminated. It has therefore been decided not to use guides inside the target block. The new radiography beam line CNR for imaging with cold neutrons will be installed at channel 52 of the spallation neutron source SINQ. It will have a direct view onto the liquid deuterium cold source. The installation is planned for the annual shutdown period-spring 2005. When operational, the CNR facility will be available for the NR community in the same way as the NEUTRA station. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The chemical compositions of the glasses were identical except the Pu-239/Pu-238 isotopic ratio, which was varied to yield accumulated doses of 1.3 x 10(16) 2.9 x 10(17) and 2.6 x 10(18) alpha-decays/g at the time of testing. Release of Al, B, Cs, Na, Si and U to solution increased with increasing pH, whereas Ca, Pu and Sr were invariant over the pH interval. Average dissolution rates, based on B release, were identical within experimental uncertainty for all three glass compositions and increased from 0.17 +/- 0.07 at pH(23 degrees C) 9 to 10.6 +/- 2.7 (g/(m(2) d(1))) at pH(23 degrees C) 12. Release rates of Pu were 10(2)- to 10(5)-fold slower compared to all other elements and were not affected by isotopic composition, self-radiation damage sustained by the glass, or pH. These data demonstrate that self-radiation damage does not affect glass dissolution rates, despite exposure to internal radiation doses for > 20 years. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A development programme focusing on yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ)-based IMF is conducted at PSI. YSZ-based IMF has so far been irradiated in two test reactors. The fabrication routes as well as the characterization of the irradiated material by ceramography, electronprobe microanalysis, and X-ray diffraction are presented. IMF fabrication by attrition milling of the oxide constituents is possible, but high sintering temperatures are required to achieve homogeneity. X-ray diffraction is a suitable tool to monitor the homogeneity. Extra efforts are needed to increase the density. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The electrical conductivity gradually decreased with decreasing oxygen partial pressure even in the hypo-stoichiometric region. These findings were in contrast to the implication of a hypo-stoichiometry where the electrical conductivity is increased through the formation of oxygen vacancies. The (U1-yGdy)O2-y/2 was defined as a new stoichiometric composition to determine the relationship between the deviation of the oxygen composition from stoichiometry and oxygen partial pressure. The dependence of the new oxygen deviation, z in (U1-yGdy)O2-y/2+z, on the oxygen partial pressure corresponds to the dependence of the electrical conductivity, and thus a consistent defect structure model can be deduced from both the dependence curves. It suggests that the defect type is oxygen interstitial even below the oxygen composition of 2. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The initial ternary alloy contained 2.9 wt% U and 8.7 wt% Pu other than Cd, which were recovered by molten salt electrolysis with liquid Cd cathode. The distillation experiments were conducted in 10 g scale of the initial alloy using a small-scale distillation furnace equipped with an evaporator and a condenser in a vacuum vessel. After distillation at 1073 K, the weight of the residue was in good agreement with that of the loaded actinides, where the content of Cd decreased to less than 0.05 wt%. The uranium-plutonium alloy product was recovered without adhering to the yttria crucible. The cross section of the product was observed using electron probe micro-analyzer and it was found to consist of a dense material. Almost all of the evaporated Cd was recovered in the condenser and so enclosed well in the apparatus. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The reduction potentials of Pu3+ and La3+ ions were measured on a Bi thin film electrode using cyclic voltammetry (CV). A difference between the peak potentials for the formation of PuBi2 and LaBi2 Of approximately 100 mV was found. Separation tests were then carried out using different current densities and salt phase compositions between a plutonium rod anode and an unstirred molten Bi cathode in order to evaluate the efficiency of an electrolytic separation process. At a current density of 12 mA/cm(2)/wt% (Pu3+), only Pu3+ ions are reduced into the molten Bi electrode, leaving La3+ ions in the salt melt. Similar results were found at two different Pu/La concentration ratios ([Pu]/[La] = 4 and 10). At a current density of 26 mA/cm(2)/Wt% (Pu3+), co-reduction of Pu and La was observed as expected by the large negative potential of the Bi cathode during the separation test. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Anghel, C; Hultquist, G; Limback, M				Anghel, C; Hultquist, G; Limback, M			Influence of Pt, Fe/Ni/Cr-containing intermetallics and deuterium on the oxidation of Zr-based materials	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							HIGH-TEMPERATURE OXIDATION; OXIDE-GROWTH MECHANISMS; ZIRCONIUM ALLOYS; ZIRCALOY-4 OXIDATION; SCALE ADHERENCE; HYDROGEN UPTAKE; KINETICS; OXYGEN; WATER; CORROSION	An in situ gas phase analysis technique and the O-18-SIMS technique are used to evaluate the transport of oxygen and hydrogen in oxidation of Zr-based materials. At 400 degrees C, it is found that oxygen dissociation efficiency decreases in the order: Pt > Zr2Fe > Zr2Ni > ZrCr2 > Zircaloy-2. Two Zr-plates partly coated with 200 angstrom porous Pt, with and respectively without D in the substrate, were oxidized in two stages at 400 degrees C. SIMS depth profiles in the Pt area show that an enhanced oxidation takes place mainly by inward oxygen transport. A minimum in the oxide thickness was found near the Pt area on both Zr plates. Two Ar-filled Zircaloy-2 tubes with ZrSn liner were exposed at 370 degrees C to 22 mbar water, filled in from one side. Our experimental results suggest that a proper choice of the SPP composition and size distribution can lead to reduced hydrogen uptake during oxidation of Zr-based materials in water.

J	Haschke, JM				Haschke, JM			Self-reduction of dioxoplutonium VI: Characterization and modeling of radiolytic and disproportionation pathways	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							PLUTONIUM OXIDE SOLUBILITY; QUANTITATIVE MODEL; CHEMISTRY; HASCHKE,J.M.; OVERSBY,V.M; PU(IV); PU(VI)	Kinetic modeling shows that self-reduction of dioxoplutonium VI is consistent with disproportionation of Pu(VI) and reaction of the Pu(VII) product with water, as well as with alpha-particle radiolysis of water and reaction of products with Pu(VI). Comparison of predicted and observed [Pu(VI)]-time data confirms that self-reduction of Pu-238(VI) at pH 0 is induced by radiolysis, but that self-reduction reactions of Pu-239(VI) at pH 1.5 and Pu-242(VI) at pH 6 are driven by disproportionation. Modeling of [Pu(VI)]-time behavior of solutions containing Po-210 as an alpha source shows that control of the reduction path changes from disproportionation to radiolytic over time at pH 0.7. Self-reduction of Pu(VI) consistently follows the most rapid path as determined by pH, Pu(VI) concentration, and the isotopic state of Pu. Chemistry and kinetics of the processes by which Pu(VI) self-reduction drives the decrease in average oxidation number of plutonium-containing solutions over time are discussed.

J	Nunez-Carrera, A; Francois, JL; Martin-Del-Campo, C; Espinosa-Paredes, G				Nunez-Carrera, A; Francois, JL; Martin-Del-Campo, C; Espinosa-Paredes, G			Design of a boiling water reactor core based on an integrated blanket-seed thorium-uranium concept	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								This paper is concerned with the design of a boiling water reactor (BWR) equilibrium core using thorium as a nuclear material in an integrated blanket-seed (BS) assembly. The integrated BS concept comes from the fact that the blanket and the seed rods are located in the same assembly, and are burned out in a once-through cycle. The idea behind the lattice design is to use the thorium conversion capability in a BWR spectrum, taking advantage of the U-233 build-up. A core design was developed to achieve an equilibrium cycle of 365 effective full power days in a standard BWR with a reload of 104 fuel assemblies designed with an average U-235 enrichment of 7.5 w/o in the seed sub-lattice. The main operating parameters, like power, linear heat generation rate and void distributions were obtained as well as the shutdown margin. It was observed that the analyzed parameters behave like those obtained in a standard BWR. The shutdown margin design criterion was fulfilled by addition of a burnable poison region in the fuel assembly. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The bisphosphonates are prototype compounds with potential to deliver rhenium radionuclides and a second therapy modality to bone metastases. A conjugate between diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid and bisphosphonate (DTPA/BP) and a conjugate between 5-fluorouracil and bisphosphonate (5-FU/BP) were prepared and labeled at high radiochemical purity with Re-188 and biodistribution studies were carried out in normal Balb/C mice. The compounds showed rapid blood clearance and elimination from soft tissues with substantial retention of activity in the bone comparable to Re-188-hydroxyethylidine diphosphonate used as a control. At 8 h bone activity was 3.51% of injected dose for Re-188-DTPA/BP and 6.38% of injected dose for Re-188-5-FU/BP representing 69.6% and 80.6% of total body radioactivity, respectively. The two compounds show the potential for combination therapy of painful bone metastases. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Factor analysis is applied on such data of Al-Awabed area, Northern Palmyrides. The seven variables used in this research are: total radioactivity Ur(1), e(U), e(Th), K%, e(U)/e(Th), e(U)/K and e(Th)/K. The analysis and interpretation show that a model of four factors (F1, F2, F3 and F4) is sufficient to represent them, where 94% of total data variance is interpreted. Mapping of these four factors proved to be a powerful tool for a direct differentiation of various rocks units, and a score lithological map of 11 radiometric units was established.

Neutron-physics, thermohydraulic, and strength calculations are used to substantiate the fundamental core design with a heavy-metal moderator which at supercritical pressure is competitive with other modern reactor designs with respect to fuel-cycle indicators. Two types of fuel-element and fuel-channel structures are examined. It is shown that fuel elements based on micropellets and a metal matrix are highly reliable and have higher operating characteristics (burnup, service lift, geometric stability. and so on) than fuel elements with uranium-dioxide fuel. A CR-SCP design and the technological scheme of a power-generating unit are presented, and the systems which are required to ensure normal operation and safety are determined. The main technical-economic indicators of a power-generating unit with installed electric power 850 MW are estimated.								Baranaev Yu.

The approach developed optimizes a cascade with arbitrary, mixture composition and a large difference in the masses of the components being separated. The application of this method to the separation of a binary mixture of uranium isotopes with impurities is examined. The properties of cascades optimized with respect to the criterion of minimum total flux are investigated. Their correspondence to R cascades with symmetric steps is analyzed. A comparison is made with optimal cascades with no impurities. It is shown that multicomponent potentials can be used to estimate the separation efficiency for a binary mixture of isotopes with an impurity.

Modem Monte Carlo programs are used to calculate the multiplication factor the excess reactivity, and the neutron flux for the fresh reactor zone 2. The calculations are performed in a wide range of variation of the zone parameters: the uranium content in the contemporary Oklo zone is varied from 35 to 55 mass% and the it,ater content from 0.355 to 455 g/cm(3). The power effect is determined. The temperature of the fresh zone is found to be 725 +/- 55 K, at which the reactor is critical and can operate in a stable manner for a long time. The power of the reactor is maintained by negative feedback. The neutron spectrum, over which the cross section of strong absorbers must be averaged, for example, Sm-149(62), in order to obtain the most accurate bounds on the possible shift of the samarium resonance as a result of a change in the fundamental constants, is found for 700 K.

J	Raymont, JM				Raymont, JM			Radioactive waste management and decommissioning in the United States	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article								With their missions and access to disposal sites changing over the last decade, radioactive waste management and decommissioning practice in the U.S. commercial and federal nuclear markets has evolved to keep pace. This paper reviews the changes that have occurred and the differing waste management practices that have resulted depending on whether a nuclear facility is Situated on federally owned or privately owned property in the United States, confirming that the cost of disposal generally dictates waste management and decommissioning practices. Of the 123 utility-owned licensed commercial reactors in U.S., 19 are undergoing decommissioning, with the balance of 104 reactors focusing on plant life extension, power upgrades, and power generation. As a result almost all of the approximately $400 million in annual expenditures on waste processing and disposal comes from waste generated from operations. In contrast, the U.S. Department of, Energy (DOE), under its Environmental Management (EM) program, is focused on decommissioning the facilities, tanks, and ground contamination resulting from 50-years of Cold War activities and spending about S 7 billion a year on these activities. Other than spent fuel, U.S. federal law precludes disposal of commercial nuclear power plant radioactive wastes at DOE disposal sites. In contrast to the commercial disposal market, which must go through extensive public hearings and decision-making, the DOE has a much freer hand in siting new disposal capacity on federal land. As a result, the DOE has ample disposal capacity, "routinely" opens new disposal sites, and enjoys disposal pricing well below the commercial market. Waste composition, volume, and activity levels drive disposal costs, which is the key lifecycle parameter in determining radioactive waste management practice. Differences in these parameters drive the differences in how radioactive waste management practice is performed in the commercial and DOE markets. Given that DOE disposal costs are about 1/10th to 1/100th that of commercial costs, the differences in disposal costs result in disposal avoidance as key utility LLW management approach and direct disposal as the key US DOE LLW management approach. In conclusion, it appears that, given the same regulatory environment, the cost of disposal generally dictates waste management and decommissioning practices due to the strong impact on life cycle analysis.

J	Hedman, T				Hedman, T			Waste management situation in Sweden	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article								Facilities for intermediate storage of spent fuel and HLW and for final disposal of ILW and LLW together with a system for sea transportation have been in operation in Sweden for more then 15 years. To complete the "back end system" the remaining parts are to build facilities for encapsulation and final storage of spent fuel and HLW. The Swedish reference method for final disposal of spent fuel, KBS-3, is to encapsulate the fuel elements in copper canisters and dispose them in a deep geological repository. The Swedish programme up to 2001 was focused on the establishment of general acceptance of the reference method for final storage and SKB's selection of candidate sites for a deep geological repository. In the end of year 2000 SKB presented a report as a base for a Government decision about the siting process. This report gave the background for the selection of three candidate sites. It also presented the programme for geological surveys of the candidate sites as well as the background for the choice of the method for Final disposal of spent nuclear fuel and HLW. In the end of 2001 the Swedish government endorsed the plan for the site selection phase and stated that the KBS-3 design of the repository shall be used as the planning base for the Work. Permissions were also granted for the fieldwork from the municipalities of Forsmark and Oskarshamn where the candidate sites are located. Site investigations on these two sites started during 2002. The technical development and demonstration of the KBS 3-method is ongoing at the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory and the Canister Laboratory. The goal for the coining five years period is to select the site for the repository and apply for licences to construct and operate the facilities for encapsulation and final storage of spent fuel. The encapsulation plant and the repository are planned to be in operation around year 2015.

J	Appel, D; Kreusch, J; Neumann, W				Appel, D; Kreusch, J; Neumann, W			Aspects of the final storage of radioactive waste within the single-repository concept	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article							GERMANY	There is consensus in the Federal Republic of Germany about storing all radioactive waste in deep geologic formations. This is possible on one site (single-repository concept) or on several sites (multi-repository concept). Which concept to prefer has undergone repeated changes in the past. Since 1998, the single-repository concept has become the federal governments waste management policy goal in the light of the planned termination of the use of nuclear power. From an ethical point of view, long-term safety is a matter of top priority in repository storage. Consequently, the best possible final storage option in this respect, and file best possible site of a repository, as determined in accordance with the rules of procedure, need to be identified. These are major preconditions of a solution to the waste management problem which is fair and equitable for present as well as future generations. When applied in a fair and equitable decisionmaking process, the single-repository concept, in a way, is the consequence of these ethical principles. At the present state of the art, there are no safety-related arguments against the single-repository concept. This is true in particular of the potential effects heat and gas generated by specific types of waste could have on the functioning of geologic barriers, and of possible chemical interactions among, various kinds of waste. These effects must be counteracted by leaving sufficient space between such waste in the repository. Within the overall waste management concept, the single-repository approach Would allow the repository capacity and the period of time for emplacing waste from the use of nuclear power to be optimized. If the site selection procedure were completed speedily, the repository would be available in time for the emplacement of spent fuel elements and high level waste as well as the medium and low level wastes arising in the future.

J	Sanei, N; Kugeler, K; Aygozhiev, K				Sanei, N; Kugeler, K; Aygozhiev, K			A safety analysis for a core catcher concept in case of a hypothetical severe accident of an 875 MWth helium cooled fast breeder reactor	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article							NATURAL-CONVECTION	A hypothetical case has been considered in which the core of a 875 MWth Helium cooled fast breeder reactor is totally molten-down. A "core catcher concept" with a sacrificial steel-bed is suggested which should encapsulate the core melt in a safe way. Its thermal performance is surveyed through a CFD-analysis. The simulation was performed using the volume of fluid (VOF) and phase change models within the FLUENT CFD-code. The heat source within the two phase melt (steel and UO2) was considered as a function of the reactor thermal power, the time that the reactor has been operating under normal conditions, and the time after shut-down. Three options have been considered, with bottom-cooling using the RNG k-epsilon and the standard-k-epsilon turbulence models and without bottom-cooling using standard k-epsilon turbulence model. In all considered cases it was found that the suggested core catcher concept matches the safety requirements. Using SCALE-code oil the basis of CFD-simulation results criticality analyses were performed in addition to ensure if the situation in the core catcher can be considered as sub-critical from neutron-physical point of view. The results showed a sub-critical condition all through in core catcher.

J	Schmitt, HH				Schmitt, HH			Large energy development projects: Lessons learned from space and politics	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th Topical Meeting on the Technology of Fusion Energy	SEP 14-16, 2004	Madison, WI				GAS SYSTEMS; FUSION-RESEARCH; CLIMATE-CHANGE; POWER; CELLS; FUEL	The challenge to global energy future lies in meeting the needs and aspirations of the ten to twelve billion earthlings that will be on this planet by 2050. At least an eight-fold increase in annual production will be required by the middle of this century. The energy sources that can be considered developed and "in the box" for consideration as sources for major increases in supply over the next hatf century are fossil fuels, nuclear fission, and, to a lesser degree, various forms of direct and stored solar energy and conservation. None of these near-term sources of energy will provide an eight-fold or more increase in energy supply for various technical, environmental and political reasons. Only a few potential energy sources that fall "out of the box" appear worthy of additional consideration as possible contributors to energy demand in 2050 and beyond These particular candidates are deuterium-tritium fusion, space solar energy, and lunar helium-3 fusion. The primary advantage that lunar helium-3 fusion will have over other "out of the box" energy sources in the pre-2050 timeframe is a clear path into the private capital markets. The development and demonstration of new energy sources will require several development paths, each of Apollo-like complexity and each with sub-paths of parallel development for critical functions and components.

The paper intends to overview these activities. With respect to the test blanket modules, solid breeder blankets with ferritic steel structure cooled by helium and water are being developed by JAERI in cooperation with universities and NIFS. Advanced blankets are being developed by universities and NIFS. In the area of tritium processing technology, RWD has been focused on the blanket tritium recovery technology. In terms of the superconducting magnet, JAERI has performed basic research for the Fusion Power Demonstration Plant, aiming at realization of toroidal filed higher than 13 T using innovative superconductors, such as Nb3Al and High Temperature Superconductors (HTS). In the RWD of negative ion based NBI technologies, a H beam of I 10 mA has been stably accelerated up to 0.9 MeV, which corresponds to the current density of 80 A/m(2). A beam power of 13.1 MW at 180 ke V has been injected from three injectors in the LHD N-NBI.

The latter include the study of ITER-like scenarios, operation in tritium (a trace tritium campaign has recently been completed), mitigation of ELMs and disruptions, investigation of tritium retention, real time control of plasma parameters, and control of extreme plasma shapes. Operation of highly shaped ITER scenarios has been demonstrated. Heating systems are being upgraded, with the enhanced NB system in full operation, an ITER-like RF antenna under manufacture, coupling of LHCD over large distances achieved and external conjugate-T matching of an RF antenna demonstrated. New diagnostics including halo current probes and neutron and alpha particle detector are being installed. In-vessel installation is being carried out remotely using up-graded remote handling tools. Analysis of tritiated samples from the 1997 tritium campaign, and the development detritiation methods for hard and soft waste continues. Substantial enhancement of JET to better exploit its capabilities in the preparations for ITER are presently being implemented.

J	Meade, DM				Meade, DM			Fire, a test bed for ARIES-RS/AT advanced physics and plasma technology	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th Topical Meeting on the Technology of Fusion Energy	SEP 14-16, 2004	Madison, WI				ELMY H-MODES; FUSION; TOKAMAKS; CONFINEMENT; PERFORMANCE; SHEAR	The overall vision for FIRE is to develop and test the fusion plasma physics and plasma technologies needed to realize capabilities of the ARIES-RS/AT power plant designs. The mission of FIRE is to attain, explore, understand and optimize a fusion dominated plasma which would be satisfied by producing DT fusion plasmas with nominal fusion gains similar to 10, self-driven currents of approximate to 80%, fusion power similar to 150 - 300 MW and pulse lengths up to 40 s. Achieving these goals will require the deployment of several key fusion technologies under conditions approaching those of ARIES-RS/AT The FIRE plasma configuration with strong plasma shaping, a double null pumped divertor and all metal plasma facing components is a 40% scale model of the ARIES-RS/AT plasma configuration. "Steady-state" advanced tokamak modes in FIRE with high beta, high bootstrap fraction and 100% non-inductive current drive are suitable for testing the physics of the ARIES-RS/AT operating modes. The development of techniques to handle power plant relevant exhaust power while maintaining low tritium inventory is a major objective for a burning plasma experiment. The FIRE H-modes and AT-modes result in fusion power densities from 3 - 10 MWm(-3) and neutron wall loading from 2 - 4 MW m(-2) which are at the levels expected from the ARIES-RS/AT design studies.

We selected two widely different systems employing SiC/SiC composites and low-activation ferritic steel (FS) as structural materials. Our results show that components of both systems qualify as Class C low-level waste (LLW) at the end of a 100 y storage period following the decommissioning of the plant. The SiC blanket, vacuum vessel, and magnet offer very low waste disposal rating to the extent that a Class A LLW seems achievable for these components. On this last point, we discussed the split between the Class A and Class C wastes, emphasizing our motivation to lower the level of ARIES-CS radioactive waste.

In the current ITER design three large equatorial ports have been allocated for blanket module testing. Typical testing conditions foreseen now include a surface heat flux of 0.1 MW/m(2), a neutron wall load of 0.78 MW/m(2), pulse length of 400 s with a duty cycle of 25%. After the first 10 years of operation one may expect to reach a total neutron fluence at the surface of test blanket modules similar to 0.12 Mwy/m(2). In the second 10 years of operation very long pulses and accumulation of neutron fluence similar to 0.3 MWy/m(2) may be expected. Test modules must not compromise ITER safety and reliability. Water-cooled modules must have their own pressure suppression system. The mass of liquid lithium is strictly limited to avoid a hydrogen explosion. Breeding blanket testing in ITER is extremely important for DEMO breeding blanket development. The best effort has to be undertaken to coordinate the Parties' activities in this area and to achieve the best use of space and time available for blanket testing in ITER.

Blanket test modules will be inserted in ITER ftom Day 1 of its operation and will provide the first experimental data on the feasibility of the D-T cycle for fusion. With the US rejoining ITER, the US community has decided to have strong participation in the ITER Test Blanket Module (TBM) Program. A US strategy for ITER-TBM has evolved that emphasizes international collaboration. A study was initiated to select the two blanket options for the US ITER-TBM in light of new RTD results from the US and world programs over the past decade. The study is led by the Plasma Chamber community in partnership with the Materials, PFC, Safety, and physics communities. The study focuses on assessment of the critical feasibility issues for candidate blanket concepts and it is strongly coupled to RTD of modeling and experiments. Examples of issues are MHD insulators, SiC insert viability and compatibility with PbLi, tritium permeation, MHD effects on heat transfer, solid breeder "temperature window" and thermomechanics, and chemistry control of molten salts. A dual coolant liquid breeder and a helium-cooled solid breeder blanket concept have been selected for the US ITER-TBM.

The critical MHD issues for self-cooled and dual coolant LM systems are the MHD pressure drop and flow distribution with ideal and imperfect insulator barriers/coatings, ideal and imperfect flow channel inserts, and complex geometry flow elements like expansions, contraction, manifolds, etc. Separately cooled LM systems still must circulate the LM for tritium removal, and similar MHD issues may limit flow velocity and influence tritium permeation due to creation of stagnant regions and other non-ideal flow distribution effects. Molten salt breeder/coolants have significantly reduced electrical conductivity as compared to LMs, and MHD pressure drop is not considered a serious issue. However, MS also has much lower thermal conductivity, and the heat transfer to/from the structure depends on turbulent convection. The degradation of convective heat transfer by MHD turbulence modification/suppression is of great interest for both self-cooled MS systems where first wall cooling may need to be enhanced, and dual coolant MS systems where heat transfer from the hot breeder to the cooler wall needs to be suppressed. These issues are discussed in detail and development plans specifically for the dual-coolant PbLi concept, up to and including integrated testing in ITER, are presented.

The liquid breeder choice includes the conventional molten salt Li2BeF4 and the low melting point molten salts such as LiBeF3 and LiNaBeF4 (FLiNaBe). Both self-cooled and dual coolant molten salt options were evaluated. We have also included the dual coolant lead-eutectic Pb-17Li design in our assessment. We take advantage of the molten salt low electrical and thermal conductivity to minimize impacts from the MHD effect and the heat losses from the breeder to the actively cooled steel structure. For the Pb-17Li breeder we employ flow channel inserts of SiCf/SiC composite with low electrical and thermal conductivity to perform respective insulation functions. We performed preliminary assessments of these design options in the areas of neutronics, thermal-hydraulics, safety, and power conversion system. Status of the RAD items of selected high performance blanket concepts is reported. Results from this study will form the technical basis for the formulation of the U.S. ITER test module program and corresponding test plan.

The concepts evaluated are a self-cooled Flinabe blanket with Be multiplier and dual-coolant blankets with He-cooled FW and structure. Three different molten salts were considered including the high melting point Flibe, a low melting point Flibe, and Flinabe. The same TBR can be achieved with a thinner self-cooled blanket compared to the dual-coolant blanket. A thicker Be zone is required in designs with Flinabe. The overall TBR will be similar to 1.07 based on 3-D calculations without breeding in the divertor region. Using Be yields higher blanket energy multiplication than obtainable with Pb. A modest amount of tritium is produced in the Be (similar to 3 kg) over the blanket lifetime of similar to 3 FPY. Using He gas in the dual-coolant blanket results in about a factor of 2 lower blanket shielding effectiveness. We show that it is possible to ensure that the shield is a lifetime component, the vacuum vessel is reweldable, and the magnets are adequately shielded. We conclude that molten salt blankets can be designed for fusion power plants with neutronics requirements such as adequate tritium breeding and shielding being satisfied.

J	Youssef, MZ; Sawan, ME				Youssef, MZ; Sawan, ME			Activation analysis for two molten salt dual-coolant blanket concepts for the US Demo reactor	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th Topical Meeting on the Technology of Fusion Energy	SEP 14-16, 2004	Madison, WI				FLIBE; FLINABE	The US has considered, among other options, two blanket concepts for Demo reactor in which helium is primarily used to cool the first wall (FW) and structure whereas molten salt (MS) is used as both coolant and breeder. Conventional reduced activation ferritic steel (RAFS, F82H) is used as the structural material in both blanket concepts. The low melting point Flibe (similar to 380 degrees C) is used in the first option while the Flinabe (similar to 305 degrees C) is used in the second option. In this paper, we present the results for assessing the radioactivity and decay heat. This assessment is performed separately for the structural material, the Be multiplier and the breeder (Flibe/Flinabe). The Class C waste disposal rating (WDR) was estimated for each material. For Flibe, Flinabe and Be the WDR is much lower than unity. However, the WDR for F82H is similar to 0.6-1.3. They are attributed to reactions with Mo and Nb present in F82H with levels of 70 wppm and 4 wppm, respectively. To ensure that F82H qualifies for shallow land burial, it is suggested to reduce these two impurities to similar to 50 and similar to 3 wppm, respectively.

A primary focus of the study is the protection of the first wall (FW) from the target emanations. This paper gives a brief analysis of one of several possible blankets that can be integrated with the chosen FW protection scheme. The structural material is conventional ferritic steel (FS) F82H cooled with liquid lithium. The maximum average temperature is constrained to 550 degrees C The chamber radius is 6.5 in at midplane, tapering to 2.5 m at the ends, and is surrounded by a cylindrical vacuum vessel. The first wall (FW) is 0.35 cm FS, which has a 0.1 cm thick layer of tungsten bonded to it facing the target. The FW is cooled with Li admitted at the bottom of the blanket, flows through a gap between 0.25-0.5 cm to the top, then returns through the center of the blanket channel to the bottom. There are 60 laser beam ports situated around the chamber. The tritium breeding ratio (TBR) is 1.124. A Brayton cycle is envisaged with an efficiency in the range of 42-44%.

This power plant utilizes fusion energy to generate electric energy in the GW range. The Z-Pinch Technology consists of compressing high-density plasma to produce X-rays to indirectly heat to ignition a deuterium/tritium fusion capsule. This ignition releases a minimum of 3 GJ every 10 seconds. The thermal energy generated is absorbed by the primary cycle fluid, and it is later used to power a Brayton or Rankine cycle. An advanced heat exchanger is used as the interface between the two cycles. This heat exchanger plays an important role in power plant performance. Three fluids (Flibe, Pb-17Li, and Li) were used for the plant performance analysis. The thermodynamic properties of the selected fluids determine the maximum operating temperature of the power cycles. Model results show that high temperatures (over 1000 degrees C) are developed in the primary cycle as needed to efficiently run the secondary cycle. The results of the performance parametric study demonstrated that the Brayton cycle exhibits better performance characteristics than the Rankine cycle for this type of application.

Here a wide spectrum of different design options for the divertor target and the first wall have been investigated with tungsten, CFC, and beryllium armor. Electron beam simulation experiments have been used to determine the performance of high heat flux components under ITER specific thermal loads. Beside thermal fatigue loads with power density levels up to 20MWm(-2), off normal events are a serious concern for the lifetime of plasma facing components. These phenomena are expected to occur on a time scale of a few milliseconds (plasma disruptions) or several hundred milliseconds (vertical displacement events) and have been identified as a major source for the production of neutron activated metallic or tritium enriched carbon dust which is of serious importance from a safety point of view. The irradiation induced material degradation is another critical concern for future D-T-burning fusion devices. In ITER the integrated neutron fluence to the first wall and the divertor armour will remain in the order of I dpa and 0.7 dpa, respectively. This value is low compared to future commercial fusion reactors; nevertheless, a non-negligible degradation of the materials has been detected, both for mechanical and thermal properties, in particular for the thermal conductivity of carbon based materials. Beside the degradation of individual material properties, the high heat flux performance of actively cooled plasma facing components has been investigated under ITER specific thermal and neutron loads.

The ITER design documents [1, 2] describe the requirements and reference designs for the ion cyclotron and pellet fueling systems. Development and testing programs are required to optimize, validate and qualify these systems for installation on ITER. The ITER ion cyclotron system offers significant technology challenges. The antenna must operate in a nuclear environment and withstand heat loads and disruption forces beyond present-day designs. It must operate for long pulse lengths and be highly reliable, delivering power to a plasma load with properties that will change throughout the discharge. The ITER ion cyclotron system consists of one eight-strap antenna, eight rf sources (20 MW, 35-65 MHz), associated high-voltage DC power supplies, transmission lines and matching and decoupling components. The ITER fueling system consists of a gas injection system and multiple pellet injectors for edge fueling and deep core fueling. Pellet injection will be the primary ITER fuel delivery system. The fueling requirements will require significant extensions in pellet injector pulse length (similar to 3000 s), throughput (400 torr-L/s,) and reliability. The proposed design is based on a centrifuge accelerator fed by a continuous screw extruder. Inner wall pellet injection with the use of curved guide tubes will he utilized for deep fueling.

The BFP calculations show that the enhancement in the fraction of the NBI heating power deposited to ions due to NES becomes appreciable when beam energy is larger than 1MeV, and the enhancement is strongly influenced by plasma parameters.

One of the first challenges faced by scientists working with radiation and radioactivity was appropriate measurement techniques. Frame (2004) has provided an excellent review of the history and development of radiation detection techniques and devices. In the early 20th century, some of these techniques were extended to measurements of the doses received by the individual scientists although it is not known exactly when organized personnel monitoring actually began. This manuscript will discuss some of the history of external dosimetry (specifically personnel monitoring), consider the developments that led to improved monitoring, attempt to assess the current status of the field and, also, to try to predict the future. The focus of this review will be primarily on personnel monitoring or personnel dosimetry. Obviously, it will not be possible to discuss every development in the field in detail and some choices have been made as to what to include and what to ignore. The author takes full responsibility for these choices. However, the goal is to provide sufficient coverage that the current situation and the future of personnel monitoring can be understood in the context of past developments. The discussion of the current status of external dosimetry will include some recent developments that hold great promise. In addition, a concern will be raised regarding the interpretation of the current U.S. federal regulations and the impact of the regulations on personnel dosimetry. Finally, there will be a discussion of what the future may hold in terms of the types of dosimeters and the approaches to personnel monitoring, in particular.

J	Chen, J				Chen, J			Estimated risks of radon-induced lung cancer for different exposure profiles based on the new EPA model	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						radon; exposure; population; cancer; lungs; human		Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas. When inhaled, radon can cause mutations that lead to lung cancer. Some new epidemiologic studies indicate that indoor radon is a public health problem. The BEIR VI report outlined its preferred two risk models for the combined effects of smoking and exposure to radon progeny, and listed the estimated risk to ever-smokers and never-smokers of both sexes due to lifetime exposure. However, exposures for shorter periods of time are of practical interest since exposure to elevated levels of radon may occur and end at any age. This study aims to produce practical tables of lifetime relative risks for exposures between any two age intervals from 0 to 110, and for various radon concentrations found in homes from 100 to 1,000 Bq m(-3). The calculations are based on the risk model developed recently by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA's risk model is a single model that gives risk values midway between those obtained from the two BEIR VI preferred models. The detailed tables provide a clearer view of the age groups at higher risk and the effect of exposure duration. The results will help radiation protection practitioners to better communicate indoor radon risk to members of the public.
