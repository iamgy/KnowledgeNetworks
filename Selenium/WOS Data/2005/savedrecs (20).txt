Male CBA/Ca mice injected with Pu-239 citrate solutions at nominal activities of 6 and 60 Bq g(-1) were mated to females ( same strain) 54 - 68 days later. Absorbed doses to the testes were estimated to be approximately 0.3 and 4.0 cGy. Control males were injected with carrier only. Longevity was evaluated. All 1807 progeny were given detailed necropsies. Haematological analysis was used in an attempt to identify leukaemia. Male progeny from both treated groups lived significantly longer than those from the control, and there was no difference in longevity between the two treatments. No evidence was found of the induction of leukaemia or of any of the numerous probable causes of death. Although numerous significant differences were found in the many comparisons made between the three groups, there was no clear indication that any harmful effects were associated with paternal preconceptional plutonium exposure. This was in spite of the initial body burden ( higher dose) being approximately 2800 times the maximum body burden allowed for workers when this study was initiated.

The chelating agents 9501 or 7601 were administered intramuscularly to ICR mice 3 min or 3 days after intraperitoneal injection of 30 MBq kg(-1 234) Th-citrate for 3 consecutive days. The animals were killed 4 or 5 days after administration of the chelating agents, respectively. The Th-234 radioactivity in the whole-body and its retention in liver and skeleton were determined. Malondialdehyde (MDA) production, as an index of Th-234-induced lipid peroxidation in bone marrow and liver, was assayed and the number of bone marrow nucleated cells (NBMNC) were counted. The pathological changes of bone marrow and liver tissue were observed. CaNa3-diethylenetriaminepentaacetate ( DTPA) and vitamin E were used as controls. The competitive ability of 9501 and 7601 to mobilize thorium with bovine serum albumin (BSA) was studied. Their inhibitory effect on superoxide anion radicals was measured by electron spin resonance. When promptly injected, 9501 or 7601 were superior to CaNa3-DTPA for reducing Th-234 retention in mouse. Their different bioactivity for decorporation of Th-234 was consistent with their competitive ability to mobilize thorium with BSA. Although the removal effectiveness of 9501 and 7601, given by delayed injection, was lower than that of the prompt administration, they could inhibit Th-234-induced lipid peroxidation. This caused significant reductions of MDA content in bone marrow and liver and markedly ameliorated histological changes to bone marrow and liver tissue in Th-234-treated mice. Their protective effects were better than CaNa3-DTPA and vitamin E. 9501 and 7601 could directly scavenge O-2(radical anion). Their effects as O-2(radical anion) scavengers were very significant. The chelating agents 9501 and 7601 are able to remove thorium as effectively as other commonly used agents like CaNa3-DTPA and reduce radiation dose. In addition, these agents have anti-oxidative action reducing both cell killing in the bone marrow and malondialdehyde levels, a measure of lipid peroxidation, in the bone marrow and liver. The protection from internally deposited radioactive material was predictable by the chelators' competitive ability to chelate thorium from BSA and their ability to act as an oxygen free-radical scavenger. The duel effect of reducing radiation dose and response could be important in reducing the risk from internally deposited gamma radionuclides.

ZrCl4 has a high reactivity with oxygen but is not corrosive to refractory metals such as steel. Rare earth oxides (La2O3, CeO2, Nd2O3 and Y2O3) and actinide oxides UO2 and PuO2) were allowed to react with ZrCl4 in a LiCl-KCl eutectic salt at 773 K to give a metal chloride solution and a precipitate of ZrO2. An addition of zirconium metal as a reductant was effective in chlorinating the dioxides. When the oxides were in powder form, the reaction was observed to progress rapidly. Cyclic voltammetry provided a convenient way of establishing when the reaction was completed. It was demonstrated that the ZrCl4 chlorination method, free from corrosive gas, was very simple and useful. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This analysis accounts for the fission production of technetium and molybdenum, in which their chemical form and volatility is determined by a thermodynamic treatment using Gibbs-energy minimization. The release kinetics are calculated according to the rate-control ling step of diffusional transport in the fuel matrix and vaporization from the fuel-grain surface. Based on several in-reactor tests with defective fuel elements, and as supported by the thermodynamic analysis, the model accounts for the washout of molybdenum from the defective fuel on reactor shutdown. The model also considers the recoil release of both Mo-99 and Tc-99 from uranium contamination, as well as a corrosion source due to activation of Mo-98. The model has provided an estimate of the activity ratio Tc-99/(CS)-C-137 in the ion-exchange columns of the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station, i.e., 6 x 10(-6) (following similar to 200days of steady reactor operation) and 4 x 10-6 (with reactor shutdown). These results are consistent with that measured by the Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories with a mixed-bed resin-sampling device installed in a number of Pressurized Water Reactor and Boiling Water Reactor plants.

It was found that approximately 20-40 % of total tritium is left in graphite even after heating to the high temperature above 1000 degrees C in dry argon. The residual tritium could be removed by exposing the graphite tile to oxygen with water vapor or hydrogen at the high temperature above 1000 degrees C. The tritium retention of the dome top tile was quantified as 84-30 kBq/cm(2). The inner dome wing tile had a steep tritium distribution from 8 to 0.1 kBq/cm(2). It is observed that a measurable amount of tritium existed in the deep site of the graphite tile. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Sato, H				Sato, H			Measurements on the thermodynamic properties of porewater in sandstone by vapor pressure method	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						geological disposal; radioactive waste; porewater; sandstone; vapor pressure; thermodynainics; activity; Gibbs free energy; enthalpy; entropy		The thermodynamic properties of porewater in sandstone were obtained as a function of water content and temperature by vapor pressure method. The activity, the relative partial molar Gibbs free energy (Delta G(H2O)), the relative partial molar enthalpy (Delta H-H2O) and the relative partial molar entropy (Delta S-H2O) of the porewater were determined at 298.15 K. The activity decreased with decreasing water content in the region where water content is about 1.5%, and drastically decreased in the region where water content is about 0.5%. No clear dependencies of Delta H-H2O and Delta S-H2O on water content were found. Synthesizing the correlations of the activity, Delta G(H2O), Delta H-H2O and Delta S-H2O with water content and the enthalpy and entropy of fusion for ice, the porewater at the surface of the solid was found to have a low chemical potential compared with free water, and dissimilar with the structure of ice. Correlating the activity and Delta G(H2O) with water content, the specific surface area of sandstone and the porosity, the porewater is deduced to be weakly affected up to a distance of approximately 3 nm from the surface of the solid. However, as the porewater approaches a distance of approximately 1.1 nm from the solid surface, the effect from the solid surface abruptly becomes strong. This is deduced to be the effects of hydrogen bond at the solid surface and hydration to cations corresponding to the CEC.

A slab phantom containing sodium chloride solution was irradiated in the Transient Experiment Critical Facility to simulate activation of sodium in body. Monte Carlo calculations were performed to obtain quantitative relation between the specific activity of induced Na-24 and neutron dose, which was imparted by charged particles liberated by neutrons, at the phantom position. In the previous work, conversion coefficients from specific activity of Na-24 in soft tissue to whole body dose had been analyzed with the MCNP-4B code concerning neutron spectra at some hypothesized configurations with fuel and surrounding materials. One of the prepared conversion coefficients was applied to evaluate neutron dose from the measured radioactivity of Na-24. The estimated dose agreed with the dose analyzed by the Monte Carlo calculations in the present study within an acceptable uncertainty for initial dose determination in an accident, which is indicated by the International Atomic Energy Agency. In addition, the dose assessed with the prepared coefficient from the quantity of induced Na-24 was close to a value, which had been previously measured with dosimeters for criticality accidents.

The current feed-through is connected to the cathode through the anode in order to apply the negative high potential. Some of accelerated ions directly bombard the feed-through as well as the cathode, and the ions, the orbits of which are deformed by lack of symmetry, hit the cathode after several bounce motions through it. The existence of the feed-through breaks the spherical symmetry of the device and shortens the lifetime of the accelerated ions. The hollow cathode also distorts a spherical potential near it. First, the effects of the structure of the spherical hollow cathode on the life are studied at various birth positions of the ions by numerically tracking the trajectory of ions in three dimensional spaces. Second, the effects of the shapes of the cathode and the anode on the life are investigated. The shapes of the cathode and the anode that assure a longer life are examined, and the virtual transparency of the cathode is numerically derived from the time dependent reduction of ions. It is revealed that the lifetime of accelerated ions becomes three times longer by deforming a hemisphere of the anode pierced by the feed-through into a hemi-ellipsoid. The results are useful in designing an anode and cathode to achieve high performance of an IEC fusion neutron source.

Among the most abundant construction materials are aluminum, steel, copper and lead. In order to obtain more reliable estimates on the radioisotope production in a high-energy hadron environment, we irradiated small samples of these materials behind the beam-stop of the CERN 24 GeV/c proton synchrotron. This environment is characterized by high spallation neutron flux and a non-negligible contribution of protons and pions up to the total beam momentum. Gamma-ray spectra of the samples were measured and analyzed with the SAMPO program and detailed nuclide identification was carried out with the SHAMAN program. The total energy emission and results of the spectrum analyses were compared to predictions of the FLUKA hadron cascade simulation package.

The method is based on post-irradiation wet-ashing and solvent extraction of vanadium with N-benzoyl-N-phenyl-hydroxylamine reagent. From the remaining aqueous phase, uranium is extracted into a toluene solution of tri-n-butyl phosphate. The chemical yields are determined spectrophotometrically for vanadium and by gamma-counting of the added natural uranium carrier for uranium. The method was evaluated by the analysis of reference materials and the results showed a good agreement with the certified values. The method was applied to the determination of vanadium and uranium in five military total diet samples in Slovenia.

J	Miller, WH; de Leon, MD				Miller, WH; de Leon, MD			Utilization of phoswich detectors for simultaneous, multiple radiation detection	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PULSE-SHAPE DISCRIMINATION; SYSTEM	A phoswich radiation detector is comprised of a phosphor sandwich in which several different phosphors are viewed by a common photomultiplier. By selecting the appropriate phosphors, this system can be used to simultaneously measure multiple radiation types (alpha, beta, gamma and/or neutron) with a single detector. Differentiation between the signals from the different phosphors is accomplished using digital pulse shape discrimination techniques. This method has been shown to result in accurate discrimination with highly reliable and versatile digital systems. This system also requires minimal component count (i.e., only the detector and a computer for signal processing). A variety of detectors of this type have been built and tested including: (1) a triple phoswich system for alpha/beta/gamma swipe counting, (2) two well-type detectors for measuring low levels of low energy photons in the presence of a high energy background, (3) a large area detector for measuring beta contamination in the presence of a photon background, and (4) another large area detector for measuring low energy photons from radioactive elements such as uranium in the presence of a photon background. An annular geometry, triple phoswich system optimized for measuring alpha/beta/gamma radiation in liquid waste processing streams is currently being designed.

J	Gardner, RP; Zhang, W; Metwally, WA				Gardner, RP; Zhang, W; Metwally, WA			Status of software for PGNAA bulk analysis by the Monte Carlo - Library Least-Squares (MCLLS) approach	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ENERGY RESOLUTION; NAI(TL)	The Center for Engineering Applications of Radioisotopes (CEAR) has been working for about ten years on the Monte Carlo - Library Least-Squares (MCLLS) approach for treating the nonlinear inverse analysis problem for PGNAA bulk analysis. This approach consists essentially of using Monte Carlo simulation to generate the libraries of all the elements to be analyzed plus any other required libraries. These libraries are then used in the linear Library Least-Squares (LLS) approach with unknown sample spectra to analyze for all elements in the sample. The other libraries include all sources of background which includes: (1) gamma-rays emitted by the neutron source, (2) prompt gamma-rays produced in the analyzer construction materials, (3) natural gamma-rays from K-40 and the uranium and thorium decay chains, and (4) prompt and decay gamma-rays produced in the NaI detector by neutron activation. A number of unforeseen problems have arisen in pursuing this approach including: (1) the neutron activation of the most common detector (NaI) used in bulk analysis PGNAA systems, (2) the nonlinearity of this detector, and (3) difficulties in obtaining detector response functions for this (and other) detectors. These problems have been addressed by CEAR recently and have either been solved or are almost solved at the present time. We have now finished the development of Monte Carlo simulation for all of the libraries except the prompt gamma-ray library from the activation of the NaI detector. We must first determine a treatment for the coincidence schemes for Na and particularly I to complete the Monte Carlo simulation of this last library.

The measured gamma-rays were selected based on their relative abundance in the spectrum and their freedom from interference or, in a few instances, ease of interference correction. From these data and the cumulative and independent yield data of England and Rider, those gamma -rays that are primarily produced by radioactive decay, as opposed to direct yield, were converted into the decays per spontaneous fission expressed in percent and compared to cumulative yield values of England and Rider. For those gamma-rays whose production is dominated by direct (independent) yield, the ratio of gamma- rays per spontaneous fission is reported. The gamma-ray yield can be compared to the independent yield values of England and Rider when 100%; of the direct feeding passes through the gamma-ray. In those cases where both cumulative and independent yields contribute to the observed gamma-ray emission rate, a direct comparison is not possible but a method to quantify the contribution from each is proposed.

J	Routti, JT				Routti, JT			WWW-based remote analysis framework for UniSampo and Shaman analysis software	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							NUCLIDE IDENTIFICATION; VERIFICATION; SYSTEM	UniSampo and Shaman are well-established analytical tools for gamma-ray spectrum analysis and the subsequent radionuclide identification. These tools are normally run locally on a Unix or Linux workstation in interactive mode. However, it is also possible to run them in batch/non-interactive mode by starting them with the correct parameters. This is how they are used in the standard analysis pipeline operation. This functionality also makes it possible to use them for remote operation over the network. We have developed a framework for running UniSampo and Shaman analysis using the standard WWW-protocol. A WWW-server receives requests from the client WWW-browser and runs the analysis software via a set of CGI-scripts. Authentication, input data transfer, and output and display of the final analysis results is all carried out using standard WWW-mechanisms. This WWW-framework can be utilized, for example, by organizations that have radioactivity surveillance stations in a wide area. A computer with a standard internet/intranet connection suffices for on-site analyses.

Also, sub-cooled boiling may introduce fluctuating quantities of bubbles. The reactivity change and its effect on the safety are important matters that must be assessed. In the present work, the reactivity induced by void insertion in various locations of the pool type, mixed (high and low enrichment uranium fuel) core of the Greek Research Reactor, was measured. The induced reactivity due to the void introduction was determined by measuring the reactor period. The measured reactivity was found to be strongly space-dependent. Results obtained with the diffusion code CITATION were found in good agreement with the experiment. Conclusions on the best utilization of diffusion codes when calculating local void effects on reactivity, in regions of steep flux gradients, were drawn. The sensitivity of the local void reactivity to the core position, as well as to the fuel enrichment and burn-up was examined. An analytical point reactor model with two neutron energy groups was developed, to investigate qualitatively the effects of parameters related to void reactivity. The analytical results were found in good qualitative agreement with measurements and numerical simulations. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As a successor to COMPTEL and EGRET (at low energies), MEGA aims to improve the sensitivity for astronomical sources by at least an order of magnitude. It could thus fill the severe sensitivity gap between scheduled or operating hard-X-ray and high-energy gamma-ray missions and open the way for a future Advanced Compton Telescope. MEGA records and images gamma-rays by completely tracking Compton and Pair creation events in a stack of double-sided Si-strip track detectors surrounded by a pixelated CsI calorimeter. A scaled down prototype has been built and we describe technical details of its design and properties. Results from calibrations using radioactive sources and from measurements with an accelerator generated, fully polarized, gamma-ray beam are presented and an outlook to future plans with MEGA is given.

The source is imaged at the focal point of a compound magnetic lens array. A novel precision microscope stage with an extremely compact design is included with the endstation's locating, targeting and imaging system. This arrangement allows a 4 m long vertical beamline without any bending magnets. The permanent magnet lens design is derived from an electrostatic lens used in our laboratory in an accelerator-based microbeam. The stand-alone microbeam is expected to produce a 10 Vm diameter beam, and will serve as a high-end instrument in a biology laboratory, to precisely deposit ionizing radiation damage within single cells.

Uranium enters the proximal tubule as uranyl-bicarbonate or uranyl-citrate complexes. The aim of our research is to investigate the mechanisms of uranium toxicity, intracellular accumulation and repartition after acute intoxication of rat renal proximal tubule epithelial cells, as a function of its chemical form. Microscopic observations of renal epithelial cells after acute exposure to uranyl-bicarbonate showing the presence of intracellular precipitates as thin needles of uranyl-phosphate localized in cell lysosomes have been published. However the initial site of precipitates formation has not been identified yet: they could either be formed outside the cells before internalization, or directly inside the cells. Uranium solubility as a function and initial concentration was specified by ICP-MS analysis of culture media. In parallel, uranium uptake and distribution in cell monolayers exposed to U-bicarbonate was investigated by nuclear microprobe analyses. Finally, the presence of uranium precipitates was tested out by scanning electron microscopic observations (SEM), while extracellular and/or intracellular precipitates were observed on thin sections of cells by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

The threshold seemed to be determined by the higher track formation threshold of two constituents forming the bilayer. Although no track formation has been observed in crystalline Si even for Uranium projectiles, interface mixing was observed previously for some Si-multilayers. In this paper we report on the interface mixing of NiO, Fe2O3, TiO2, on Si due to irradiation with 90-350 MeV Ar-, Kr-, Xe- and Au-ions at 80 K at fluences up to 9E15 ions/cm(2). Interface mixing, analyzed by means of Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS), is found for these bilayers, too. But the threshold for intermixing is significantly higher compared to the ceramic/ceramic bilayers. This observation could be an evidence for the threshold being determined by the Si-layer. In contrast to NiO/Si and Fe2O3/Si, where an usual random walk mixing Delta sigma(2) = k Phi was observed, the interface broadening Delta sigma(2) for TiO2/Si is found to scale nonlinearly with the ion fluence, which indicates that mixing is driven by a chemical solid-state reaction. At higher fluences plateaus form at the low energy Ni-edge of the RBS spectra. The plateaus indicate phase formation. X-Ray diffraction spectra does not show any evidence for new crystalline phases.

A test experiment has been performed to measure the diffusion coefficients of Li in the sample of LiAl compound, by using the alpha-emitting radiotracer of Li-8 (T-1/2 = 0.84 s). The yields of alpha-particles emitted from diffusing 8Li primarily implanted in the sample have been measured as a function of time under a recurrent time sequence; the implantation of Li-8 for 1.5 s (beam-on) and subsequent diffusion for 4.5 s (beam-off). We have found that the time-dependent yields of the alpha-particles could be used as a measure of the diffusivity of the tracer in a none-destructive way. By taking into account the experimental conditions, we have simulated the time-dependent alpha-particle yields for various diffusion coefficients and compared with the experimental ones in order to extract the diffusion coefficients of Li in the sample. The process of the simulations and the comparisons is discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These alterations have important practical consequences when calculating soil water storages and matric potentials, widely used in irrigation management. The present paper has as objective to use gamma ray computed tomography (GCT) as a tool to investigate possible modifications in soil structure induced by W-D cycles and to analyze how these alterations can affect soil water retention. The GCT scanner used was a first generation system with a fixed source-detector arrangement, with a radioactive gamma ray source of Am-241. Soil samples were taken from profiles of three different soils characterized as Xanthic Ferralsol (Fx), Eutric Nitosol (Ne) and Rhodic Ferralsol (Fr). Eighteen samples (50 cm 3), six from each soil, were submitted to none (To), three (T-1) and nine (T,) wetting/drying cycles. Based on image analysis it was possible to detect modifications in soil structure in all samples after wetting/drying cycles for all treatments. Tomographic unit profiles of the samples permitted to identify an increase on soil porosity with the increase in the number of wetting/drying cycles and it was also possible to quantify the average porosity values. The statistical test (Duncan test) indicates that there are significant differences between treatments for all samples at the 5% significance level. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

(2) the etchable track length and (3) the track counting efficiency in the external detector. The values of these parameters have been determined by calculation and experiment and are shown to have a significant effect on the calculated uranium concentrations. The new equation was tested by calculating the uranium concentrations in standard uranium glasses (CN-5, IRMM-540R) and apatite samples (Durango; horse tooth) in which the uranium content was also determined with independent methods (INAA; ENAA; TIMS). The results show that: (1) accurate measurements with the fission-track method are feasible within a broad range of uranium concentrations and (2) uranium determinations based on standards are only accurate if the standard and sample are made of the same material. Because the absolute fission-tack dating method is also based on accurate thermal neutron fluence measurements and similar correction factors for the track registration and counting efficiencies, this study provides a strong endorsement for the fact that absolute fission-track ages are accurate.

We have conducted an intercomparison between the two currently available methods for measurement at these low (radio) activities: accelerator mass spectrometry (AM S) and resonance ionization mass spectrometry (RIMS). Three artificially produced Ca-41 samples, primarily of cosmochemical importance, with isotopic abundances in the range of 10(-11)-10-(10) were used and results of these measurements show good agreement between the two methods, within the experimental uncertain ties.

The total time of power operation of the plant is similar to 100000 h representing 3860 equivalent fuel power days (EFPD). With the initial objective of the demonstration of fast breeder reactors achieved, since the early 1990s, the role of the reactor as an irradiation facility has been emphasized, particularly in support of the Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique research and development program on long-lived radioactive waste transmutation. This new objective required an extension of the planned reactor lifetime. A major renovation program was carried out in the plant from 1994 to 2003, involving safety upgrading, component inspections and repairs, and the 10-yr statutory maintenance. The main work consisted of the addition of a backup control rod to the reactor; improvement of earthquake protection by reinforcement of buildings and components and replacement of the emergency water cooling circuit; improvement of protection against sodium fire by partitioning the secondary sodium circuit in the steam generator building, reinforcement of steam generator casing, and installation of an antiwhip system on the high-pressure steam pipes; replacement of hot parts of the 321 stainless steel secondary loops and steam generator modules, affected by delayed reheat cracking; special inspections of the reactor internal structures to demonstrate their good condition. An extensive plant requalification program was carried out following the renovation work, and the plant resumed power operation in June 2003. Six operating cycles are planned, representing a total irradiation time of 720 EFPD equivalent to similar to 5.5 yr of operation.

As an international effort between the United States and the Republic of Kazakhstan, a cesium-trapping system was jointly designed, fabricated, installed, and successfully operated. The results are significant for a number of reasons, including (a) a significant reduction of radioactivity levels of the BN-350 coolant and reactor surfaces, thereby reducing exposure to workers during shutdown operations; (b) demonstration of scientific ideas; and (c) the engineering application of effective cesium trap deployment for commercial-sized liquid-metal reactors. About 255 300 GBq (6900 Ci) of cesium was trapped, and the Cs-137 specific activity in BN-350 primary sodium was decreased from 296 MBq/kg (8000 mu Ci/kg) to 0.37 MBq/kg (10 mu Ci/kg) by using seven cesium traps containing reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) as the cesium adsorbent. Cesium trapping was accomplished by pumping sodium from the primary circuit, passing it through a block of RVC within each trap, and returning the cleaned sodium to the primary circuit. Both to predict and to analyze the behavior of the cesium traps in the BN-350 reactor primary circuit, a model was developed that satisfactorily describes the observed results of the cesium trapping. By using this model, thermodynamic parameters, such as the heat of adsorption of cesium atoms on RVC and on internal piping surfaces of the BN-350 reactor primary circuit, -22.7 and -5. 0 kJ/mole, respectively, were extracted from the experimental data.

It was shown that the neural network provides useful data even from small experimental databases. The performance of the optimized neural network was found to be very good, with correlation coefficients (R-2) between measured and predicted uncertainties ranging from 0.9050 to 0.9915. The correlation coefficients did not significantly deteriorate when the network was tested on samples with greatly different uranium-to-thorium (U-238/Th-232) ratios. The differences between measured and predicted uncertainties were not influenced by the absolute values of uncertainties of measured radionuclide activities. Once the ANN is trained, it could be employed in analyzing soil samples regardless of the U-238/Th-232 ratio. It was concluded that a considerable saving in time could be obtained using the trained neural network model for predicting the measurement times needed to attain the desired statistical accuracy.

This detector is designed for observing fusion neutrons at the Z accelerator in Sandia National Laboratories. Nuclear fusion from laser driven deuterium cluster explosions was used to generate a clean source of nearly monoenergetic 2.45 MeV neutrons at a well-defined time. This source can run at 10 Hz and was used to build up a clean pulse-height spectrum on scintillating neutron detectors giving a very accurate calibration for neutron yields at 2.45 MeV.

ELECTROPRODUCTION; DEPOLARIZATION; RECOMBINATION; DISTRIBUTIONS; ASYMMETRIES	The HERMES hydrogen and deuterium nuclear-polarized gas targets have been in use since 1996 with the polarized electron beam of HERA at DESY to study the spin structure of the nucleon. Polarized atoms from a Stern-Gerlach Atomic Beam Source are injected into a storage cell internal to the HERA electron ring. Atoms diffusing from the center of the storage cell into a side tube are analyzed to determine the atomic fraction and the atomic polarizations. The atoms have a nuclear polarization, the axis of which is defined by an external magnetic holding field. The holding field was longitudinal during 1996-2000, and was changed to transverse in 2001. The design of the target is described, the method for analyzing the target polarization is outlined, and the performance of the target in the various running periods is presented.

J	Dagan, R				Dagan, R			On the use of S(alpha,beta) tables for nuclides with well pronounced resonances	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							GAS SCATTERING KERNEL; NEUTRON-SCATTERING; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; CROSS-SECTIONS; BINDING; MODEL	The use of S(alpha,beta) tables for evaluating the secondary energy distribution is restricted in the MCNP code [Briesmeister, J.F. (Ed.), 1997. MCNP - A General Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport Code, LA-12625-M] to light isotopes only. The reason is the free gas model in NJOY, [Macfarlane, R.E., Muir, D.W., 1994. The NJOY Nuclear Data Processing System Version 91, LA-12740-M] which does not account for heavy isotopes with strongly energy dependent cross-sections. The joint scattering kernel developed by [Rothenstein, W., Dagan, R., 1998. Ann. Nucl. Energ. 25, 209-222] improved the secondary energy distribution treatment in a manner consistent with the BROADR module in NJOY. [Rothenstein, W., 2004. Ann. Nucl. Energ. 31, 9-23] enabled the generation of S(alpha,beta) by implementing a new formalism for the modified kernel into the NJOY module THERMR. The new generated S(alpha,beta) tables for heavy isotopes with pronounced resolved resonances were added to the MCNP library data files and the MCNP code itself, was modified accordingly. The quantitative effects of using scattering kernel tables in the vicinity of resonances were analyzed by introducing them into the Tellier et al. [Tellier, H., Costa, M., Raepsaet, C., Van der Gucht, C., 1993. 113, 20-30] benchmark problem. The absorption rate and the Doppler effect were calculated for the pronounced eight S-type resonances of U-238 within the energy range 2.7-210 eV. The introduced S(alpha,beta) tables for 238U increases the Doppler effect by 23.5% in comparison with the existing MCNP calculation method. Over the entire Resolved Resonance Region (RRR) this means an increase of 17.5%. The overall absorption rate over the entire RRR is increased by 1.4% at 1200 K and by 2.1% at 1800 K.

J	Brolly, K; Vertes, P				Brolly, K; Vertes, P			Concept of a small-scale electron accelerator driven system for nuclear waste transmutation Part 2. Investigation of burnup	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								In our earlier paper the target optimization of an electron-neutron (e-n) converter based molten salt ADS concept (MSENC) was presented. In this paper the burnup in this molten salt ADS is investigated. The system is continuously fueled with TRUs obtained from spent nuclear fuel by means of pyrochemical separation, while fission products are continuously filtered out. Effect of MSENC operation on transuranium consumption, mass reduction and radiotoxicity is considered. It seems that while the amount of plutonium is reduced significantly, the higher actinides will build up, which results that radiotoxicity of nuclear waste will not be reduced considerably.

J	Yapici, H; Gokcek, M				Yapici, H; Gokcek, M			Rejuvenation of spent fuel in the force-free helical reactor (FFHR)	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							FUSION-REACTOR; FLIBE BLANKET; DESIGN; TRANSMUTATION; PERIOD	This study considers spent fuel rejuvenation potential of the force-free helical reactor (FFHR), which is a relevant heliotron-type D-T fusion reactor. For this purpose, three different spent fuels were selected, i.e.: (1) CANDIJ, (2) PWR-UO2, and (3) PWR-MOX spent fuels. The spent fuel (volume fraction of 60%), spherically prepared and cladded with SiC (volume fraction of 10%), was located in the fuel zone (FZ) in the blanket of the FFHR. The FZ was cooled with high-pressured helium gas (volume fraction of 30%) for the nuclear heat transfer. The neutronic calculations were performed by solving the Boltzmann transport equation with the help of the neutron transport code XSDRNPM-S/SCALE4.3. The calculations of the time dependent atomic densities of the isotopes were performed for an operation period (OP) of up to 4 years by 75%, plant factor (n) under a first-wall neutron load (P) of 1.5 MW/m(2). The temporal variations of the atomic densities of the isotopes in the spent fuel composition and other physical parameters were calculated for a discrete time interval (At) of 1/12 year (one month), by using the interface program (code). In all investigated spent fuel cases, the tritium self-sufficiency is maintained for DT fusion driver along the OP. The CANDU spent fuel becomes usable in a conventional CANDU reactor after a regeneration time of similar to6 months. The CFFE value approaches 3.5% in the blanket fuelled with the PWR-UO2 and -MOX spent fuels after 40 and 34 months, respectively. The plutonium component can never reach a nuclear weapon grade quality during spent fuel rejuvenation. Consequently, the blanket has high neutronic performance for the rejuvenation of the spent fuels. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The calculations were carried out for a Li-7(p,n) reaction-based PGNAA setup with an external moderator similar to the one used in a previous 2.8 MeV neutrons-based PGNAA setup. The optimum values of geometry parameters of the Li-7(p,n) reaction-based setup are different from those of the 2.8 MeV neutrons-based setup resulting in better performance of the 7Li(p,n) reaction-based setup. The prompt gamma-ray yield from the Li-7(p,n) reaction-based setup is 60-70% higher than that from the 2.8 MeV neutrons-based setup. Although the performances of the Li-7(p,n) reaction-based setup is comparable with that of a previously studied 3 H(p,n) reaction-based setup, yet performance of the Li-7(p,n) reaction-based setup is superior to that of the 3 H(p,n) reaction-based setup because it has less radiation hazard due to utilization of non-radioactive neutron producing target. This study has provided a theoretical base for experimental test of a Li-7(p,n) reaction-based PGNAA setup. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The computational model of tritium mass transfer for a three-loop nuclear power system is based on an analysis of the balance of hydrogen and tritium in the first and second loops. The following are calculated for the BN-600 and Phoenix reactors which are currently in operation: the concentration of hydrogen and tritium in the first two loops, the concentration of tritium in the protective gas and the steam-water medium in the third loop, and the tritium fluxes into the cold traps, the third loop, and the surrounding environment. About similar to 2.2 TBq/(GW.yr) tritium flow into the atmosphere through the walls of loops with nominal system parameters, and about 3 TBq/(GW.yr) flows into the third loop. The cold traps in the first and second loops catch about 99% of the tritium produced.

For electrochemical cell voltage 2.1 V the ratio of uranium and plutonium in the cathode deposit obtained corresponds to the ratio in the electrolyte. Thus the requirement for nonpartitioning of actinides is achieved. Under these conditions, americium and neptunium precipitate simultaneously on the cathode. The conditions for complete precipitation of uranium and plutonium are determined experimentally. A residual concentration of these elements of 0.43 and 0.05 mass %, respectively, in the electrolyte is achieved.

J	Stoll, W				Stoll, W			Material disposition - a revival for shortcomers?	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article							REACTOR; FUELS	Nuclear disarmament is an enduring and costly activity among the former Superpowers. This flow of money attracts many of the now suffering niche-concepts for reactors and fuel cycles, having survived so far from early enthusiastic times, in praising their merits for just this material disposition. While stringent MD-criteria could be met in standard LWR with very simple and conventional MOX fuels, both nuclear military powers are tempted to use this expensive exercise to a covert modernisation of their fuel cycles for a later economic cycle closure, in Russia even with an eye on later uranium savings by near breeder concepts. The demonstrated Russian reluctance in "wasting" their costly Plutonium must be sweetened by a generous US support of a variety of research topics, including the mentioned near-breeder concepts, keeping Russian scientists on the peaceful track. Earlier principles of never embarking into a "Plutonium economy" are softened into a bilateral exception for both weapon's superpowers, as most of the industrialized non-nuclear weapon states have been pushed into abandoning the closed fuel cycle already and a general ban for new national fuel cycle activities is on the agenda of the coming NPT review conference. It remains to be seen, whether those concessions to the still martial behaviour of Russia will ever bear fruit or whether later generations will have to pay the price for a potentially unwarranted appeasement.

J	Grahn, PH; Hedin, G				Grahn, PH; Hedin, G			Swedish plans and experience regarding management of spent fuel and core components	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article								In Sweden, the duties and responsibilities involved in handling radioactive waste were defined in the seventies. The 1976 Stipulation Law provides for the originator of the waste to be fully responsible for the waste arising in the course of plant operation. SKB, Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Co., was founded by the Swedish operators of nuclear power plants in 1972 to take care of nuclear power plant waste management and radioactive waste treatment. In the eighties, the Finance Act was adopted which provides for the establishment of a fund to finance complete disposal of nuclear power plant waste, including radioactive waste and spent fuel. Over the past few years, there have been various developments in nuclear power plant waste management: - Reprocessing of spent fuel is no longer part of the waste management strategy. The fuel elements are stored in a central interim store, CLAB, which has been in operation since 1985 and now holds approx. 4000 t of fuel elements. - A transport system for radioactive waste and spent fuel has been in operation successfully since 1985. - A repository for low- and medium-level waste has been in operation since 1985. - Work has been underway for the past twenty years in research, development, and construction of an underground repository for spent fuel. Development has now reached a stage which will allow a decision to be taken within the next five or ten years about the sites of the conditioning plant and the repository.

Thirty-one urine samples were collected over 24-h periods on different occasions from these subjects and were analyzed using high resolution sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HR-SF-ICP-MS). Using this instrument a limit of detection of 20 pg L-1 for thorium in the reagent blank was achieved. The median (mean) daily urinary thorium excretion was obtained as 1.0 (1.8) ng. This was in good agreement with the mean value of 1.5 ng Th (6 muBq) reported by another group for German population, but is significantly lower in comparison to the daily excretion range of 3.6 to 105 ng reported from other countries. The expected daily urinary excretion of thorium for the adult German population was also calculated by applying the new ICRP biokinetic model of thorium assuming reference intake values. The expected urinary thorium excretion rate for this age group is about 0.1 ng per day. Even if a small contribution from the inhalation is considered, the calculated value will be much lower than the measured values. The reason for the disagreement appears to be the use of a low gastrointestinal absorption factor (f(1)) of 5 x 10(-4) in the ICRP model. Based on the present study, a higher f(1), factor might be proposed separately for dietary incorporated thorium.

The study population consisted of 205 individuals living in 134 different households in southern Finland where drinking water is supplied from private drilled wells. The population was selected to include a broad range of uranium daily intake from drinking water (0.03-2,775 mug d(-1)). The uranium content in drinking water, urine (overnight collection), hair and nails was determined by ICPMS. Uranium in urine was corrected for the matrix effects by use of thallium as an internal standard and adjusted by creatinine normalization. Hair and toenail samples were rinsed to remove external contamination prior to acid digestion and analysis. The uranium content in all excretion pathways was correlated with the uranium intake, particularly at elevated levels (greater than or equal to 10 mug d(-1)) where drinking water was the major source of exposure to uranium. The median of the individual uranium absorption factors for urine, hair, and toenails were f(u) = 0.003, f(u) = 0.003, and f(n) = 4 x 10(-5), respectively. The association between the different bioassays was examined. The absorption factor, f(1) was calculated for the population with an intake above 10 mug d(-1) and was below 0.01 for 72% of the study persons (range 0.0002 to 0.070). No statistically significant difference in f(1) values was found between women and men. However, the absorption factor was higher among younger (< 60 y) than older (greater than or equal to 60 y) subjects and among people with a lower exposure (below 100 mug d(-1)) than among those that ingest over 100 mug d(-1).

The nodular goiter is a common disease seen in the city of Elazig and its surroundings, in the eastern part of Turkey. A prospective study was conducted in an effort to identify the role of I-129 in drinking water supply. Specimens obtained from nodular and normal thyroid tissue during surgery and also water specimens were counted by nuclear spectrometric system. I-129 radioactivity in nodular tissue was noted to be higher compared to normal tissue and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) between I-129 radioactivity in the water supply and tissue obtained from the patients who have malignant or benign nodular lesions. These results support that the I-129 radioactivity level in the water supply is one of the risk factors of the nodular formation of the thyroid tissue in the eastern part of Turkey.

Nine wells were sampled from the affected area and analyzed for total uranium, U-234,U-235,U-238, Ra-226,Ra-228, Rn-222, and Pb-210 as well other water quality parameters. These data augment other uranium concentration measurements and limited Ra-226,Ra-228 and Rn-222 concentration measurements collected on private and public wells by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control. The observed radionuclide data were compared to maximum levels published in several national surveys from the past 30 years. The total uranium concentration in the groundwater ranged from 44.3 to 5,570 mug L-1, with one well having the second highest published concentration in the U.S. The U-234/U-238 activity ratio ranged from 1.1 to 2.5. Ra-226 concentrations ranged from less than the minimum detectable concentration (< MDC) to 1,154 mBq L-1 while the Ra-228 concentration ranged from < MDC to 532.8 mBq L-1 and the Rn-222 levels ranged from 62 to 1,510 Bq L-1. The Pb-210 concentrations ranged from < MDC to 844 mBq L-1.

J	Kitto, ME; Kim, MS				Kitto, ME; Kim, MS			Naturally occurring radionuclides in community water supplies of New York State	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						uranium; water; radium; effective dose		During a 2-y study, drinking-water samples were analyzed for gross-alpha and gross-beta activity in 1,869 community water supplies in New York State. Among these, 87 and 14 samples were further analyzed for radium and uranium activity, respectively. The results showed that concentrations in drinking water samples met regulatory limits for gross-alpha, gross-beta, and combined radium in over 99% of the community water supplies tested. Gross-alpha activity in 97% of the supplies was below half of the maximum contaminant level. In the water samples that exceeded the maximum contaminant level, a significant part of the gross-alpha activity was contributed by dissolved uranium. In the 14 supplies that contained >556 mBq L-1 (15 pCi L-1) of gross-alpha activity, the mean uranium concentrations were 548 mBq L-1 and ranged from 36 to 2,135 mBq L-1. In the 87 supplies that contained >185 mBq L-1 of gross-alpha activity, the mean Ra-226 and Ra-228 concentrations were each 52 mBq L-1. Based on the mean concentrations in the measured water supplies, the radioactive dose due to ingestion of Ra-226, Ra-228, and uranium is about 27 muSv y(-1), respectively, with Ra-228 alone producing half of the dose.

Movement of the strike point down the vertical divertor target in the direction of the QMB increases the deposition. Largest carbon deposition is found with the strike point located at the corner of the horizontal divertor plate which offers a direct line-of-sight to the QMB. Monte-Carlo modelling with the ERO transport code reproduces the dependence of material deposition at the QMB on the plasma configuration. A further enhanced carbon flux to the QMB is detected if the strike point is moved for the first time to a location where a carbon layer was built up in former shots. This can be understood in terms of a much larger erosion yield for re-deposited carbon compared with bulk material. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
