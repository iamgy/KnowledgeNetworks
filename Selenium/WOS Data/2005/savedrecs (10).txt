J	Kim, GY; Lee, HK; Jeong, HK; Woods, MJ				Kim, GY; Lee, HK; Jeong, HK; Woods, MJ			Comparison of radioactivity calibrators in the measurements with radionuclide Republic of Korea	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						comparison; iodine; technetium; radionuclide calibrator; radioactivity	INTERCOMPARISONS	Recognizing the importance of comparisons of radionuclide calibrators in nuclear medicine and the need to provide access to activity standards that are traceable to the international measurement system, the Korea Food & Drug Administration (KFDA) as a national secondary standard dosimetry laboratory (SSDL), started a comparison program in 2002. The first two comparisons were conducted with I-131 (71 participants) and Tc-99m (72 participants). The results indicated that only 61% of reported activities for I-131 and 65% for Tc-99m were within +/- 5% of the correct value. These numbers increased to 84% for I-131 and 83% for Tc-99m when a +/- 10% limit was applied. Follow-up action on those calibrators with results outside the 10% limits only produced a small improvement. There was also a marked difference in performance between the various calibrator types used. The results have shown that such comparisons are necessary to improve the quality of the measurements and to identify those radionuclide calibrators that are not functioning correctly.

Most of the procedures developed for these chemical characterisations involve several separation steps to prepare the sample for measurement. Chemical treatments are time- and manpower-consuming, labour intensive and produce significant quantities of waste. In order to address this problem, we evaluate a data treatment procedure (multivariate calibration-PLS), which we propose as a substitute to some of these separation steps. Mixtures of beta emitter radionuclides of increasing complexity (Sr-90/Y-90-Tc-99, Sr-90/Y-90(9)-Tc-90-Ni-63-Cs-137 and Sr-90/Y-90-Tc-99-Ni-63-Cs-137-Fe-55) have been measured by liquid scintillation (LS) counting. The influences of quenching and level of activity was evaluated and the activity of unknown samples determined. Despite the spectra overlapping and low resolution of LS, relative errors in the activities quantification of unknown samples inside the range covered by the calibration matrix are lower than 15% whatever the number of radionuclides included in the solution was.

The radioactivities of 55 samples have been measured with a low-background HPGe detector. The radioactivity concentrations of U-238 and 4 K ranged from 40.2 to 442 and from 442 to 913 Bq/kg, respectively, while the radioactivity concentration of Th-232 varied only slightly. In order to evaluate the radiological hazard of the natural radioactivity, the radium equivalent activity (Ra-eq), the absorbed dose rate (D), the annual effective dose rate and the external hazard index (H-ex) have been calculated and compared with the internationally approved values. The study provides background radioactivity concentrations in a granite area, specifically, the area in the vicinity of a uranium mine in Southern China. The data can be used in exploring granite-type uranium deposits. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Fourteen granitic samples from the Kaymaz and Sivrihisar plutons and 11 groundwater samples from the near vicinity of the pluton were analyzed. The activity concentrations measured for U-238 and Th-222 ranged from 43.59 +/- 2 to 651.80 +/- 24 Bq/kg, and 51.16 +/- 3 to 351.94 +/- 13 Bq/kg, respectively. The activity concentrations obtained for 4 K varied from 418.50 +/- 17 to 1618.03 +/- 66 Bq/kg. The absorbed dose rates in air outdoors ranged from 87.14 to 531.81 nGy/h. All the results obtained from the Kaymaz pluton are higher than those from the Sivrihisar. The U (ave. 16.6 ppm) and Th (ave. 49.9 ppm) values of the Kaymaz pluton are higher than the average concentrations of the magmatic rocks of granitic composition. These results are consistent with high dose rates of the pluton.

It is shown that under normal operating conditions the specific activity of I-131 in the coolant is correlated with the iron concentration. During shutdown, its content increases by factors of 30-200. The emission of I-131 into the coolant can be decreased by factors of 10-15 and the degree of unsealing of fuel elements can be decreased if before shutdown the reactor is held for 2-5 days at 50% of the nominal power level. Recommendations are made for decreasing I-131 emissions into the atmosphere. The adoption of these recommendations at the Leningrad nuclear power plant has reduced the I-131 emissions into the atomsphere by a factor of 17.

One reason frequently given for this date is the intermediate storage period of at least forty years to allow the very high initial heat generation to decay. However, calculations performed by the authors have shown that the minimum intermediate storage period for a repository in rock salt is only between four and nineteen years, depending on the final storage concept and the load of the waste package. In clay as a host rock, the minimum intermediate storage times were calculated to be between 31 and 142 years; the same time spans are expected to apply to final storage in magmatic rock, such as granite. The maximum permissible loads of a container holding spent fuel in salt are many times those in clay and granite, respectively. It was also seen that the area requirement for final storage of the same waste structures is roughly a factor of ten higher in clay than in salt. The differences between granite and salt are similar. The reasons for these grave differences, on the one hand, are the better thermal conductivity of salt and, on the other hand, the better heat tolerance of the crushed salt used as backfill material compared to that of bentonite used in the clay and granite concepts. While salt will allow temperatures of up to 200 degrees C, the maximum temperature in bentonite is limited to 100 degrees C	DBE Technol GmbH, D-31224 Peine, Germany	Muller-Hoeppe, N (reprint author), DBE Technol GmbH, Eschenstr 55, D-31224 Peine, Germany.

Managing wall loads and stresses in ITER, which initially will be run only in the pulsed mode, is important especially in the interest of high availability of the experiment. The article describes the current state of research into plasma wall interactions and, in particular, the approaches to solutions and the strategies pursued in European fusion research to optimize the availability of ITER.

The primary concern has been the potential health effects resulting from exposure to residual radioactive materials to be released for unrestricted use. These debates have intensified in the last decade as many regulated facilities are seeking viable management decisions on the disposition of the large amounts of materials potentially containing very low levels of residual radioactivity. Such facilities include the nuclear weapons complex sites managed by the U.S. Department of Energy, commercial power plants licensed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and other materials licensees regulated by the NRC or the Agreement States. Other facilities that generate radioactive material containing naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) or technologically enhanced NORM (TENORM) are also seeking to dispose of similar materials that may be radioactively contaminated. In contrast to the facilities operated by the DOE and the nuclear power plants licensed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NORM and TENORM facilities are regulated by the individual states. Current federal laws and regulations do not specify criteria for releasing these materials that may contain residual radioactivity of either man-made or natural origin from regulatory controls. In fact, the current regulatory scheme offers no explicit provision to permit materials being released as "non-radioactive," including those that are essentially free of contamination. The only method used to date with limited success has been case-by-case evaluation and approval. In addition, there is a poorly defined and inconsistent regulatory framework for regulating NORM and TENORM. Some years ago, the International Atomic Energy Agency introduced the concept of clearance, that is, controlling releases of any such materials within the regulatory domain. This paper aims to clarify clearance as an important disposition option for solid materials, establish the framework and basis of release, and discuss resolutions regarding the implementation of such a disposition option.

J	Hayes, RB; Pena, AM; Goff, TE				Hayes, RB; Pena, AM; Goff, TE			Use of alpha spectroscopy for conducting rapid surveys of transuranic activity on air sample filters and smears	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						air sampling; plutonium; spectroscopy; alpha; radon progeny		This paper demonstrates the utility of a portable alpha Continuous Air Monitor (CAM) as a bench top scalar counter for multiple sample types. These include using the CAM to count fixed air sample filters and radiological smears. In counting radiological smears, the CAM is used very much like a gas flow proportional counter (GFPC), albeit with a lower efficiency. Due to the typically low background in this configuration, the minimum detectable activity for a 5-min count should be in the range of about 10 dpm which is acceptably below the 20 dpm limit for transuranic isotopes. When counting fixed air sample filters, the CAM algorithm along with other measurable characteristics can be used to identify and quantify the presence of transuranic isotopes in the samples. When the radiological control technician wants to take some credit from naturally occurring radioactive material contributions due to radon progeny producing higher energy peaks (as in the case with a fixed air sample filter), then more elaborate techniques are required. The techniques presented here will generate a decision level of about 43 dpm for such applications. The calibration for this application should alternatively be done using the default values of channels 92-126 for region of interest 1. This can be done within 10 to 15 min resulting in a method to rapidly evaluate air filters I or transuranic activity. When compared to the 1-h count technique described by Hayes (2004), the technique presented in the present work demonstrates a technique whereby more than two thirds of samples can be rapidly shown (within 10 to 15 min) to be within regulatory compliant limits. In both cases, however, spectral quality checks are required to insure sample self attenuation is not a significant bias in the activity estimates. This will allow the same level of confidence when using these techniques for activity quantification as is presently available for air monitoring activity quantification using CAMs.	Radiol Technol, Carlsbad, NM 88221 USA	Hayes, RB (reprint author), Radiol Technol, MS 452-06,WIPP Site,POB 2078, Carlsbad, NM 88221 USA.	robert.hayes@wipp.ws					BARTLETT WT, 1996, EEG60; BARTLETT WT, 1993, EEG52; BRASE CH, 2003, UNDERSTANDABLE STAT; GOFF T, 2001, RADIAT PROT MGMT, V18, P30; Hayes R, 2004, HEALTH PHYS, V87, P429, DOI 10.1097/00004032-200410000-00011; Hayes R, 2003, HEALTH PHYS, V85, pS81, DOI 10.1097/00004032-200311002-00008; Hayes R, 2002, HEALTH PHYS, V82, pS103, DOI 10.1097/00004032-200205001-00015; Hayes RB, 2002, HEALTH PHYS, V82, P887, DOI 10.1097/00004032-200206000-00019; Hayes RB, 2003, HEALTH PHYS, V86, P80; HOOVER MD, 1990, EVALUATION EBERLINE	10	5	5	2	2	LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS	PHILADELPHIA	530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA	0017-9078	1538-5159		HEALTH PHYS	Health Phys.

Doses to staff, nearby patients, and the collective effective doses were estimated for the different working shifts and hospital areas. The estimated dose for nurses for 1y was 518 mu Sv In the cardiology section and 338 mu Sv in the short stay section. For patients, the mean dose per stay was calculated to be 8.5 mu Sv in the cardiology section. The maximum dose that a patient could receive from a radioactive patient is 499 mu Sv for a double injection cardiac patient study. The maximum collective effective dose for the whole hospital was calculated to be 0.063 person-Sv. The probability of staff receiving doses higher than the limits for a working day is negligible. Maximum doses for staff and patients are far below dose limits for the public and therefore no additional radiological protection is needed.

J	Krieger, K				Krieger, K			NORM contamination - Now you see it, now you don't	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topics; contamination; naturally occurring radionuclides; gamma radiation		Contamination from naturally occurring radioactive material on the inside of piping or tanks in refineries can usually be easily detected from the outside by external gamma measurements with simple count rate meters or more complicated gamma spectroscopy instruments. Usually, such contamination is from radium in equilibrium with its progeny. A number of different gamma rays are emitted by this mix. However, due to certain processes or circumstances, a significant amount of NORM can be present without the characteristic gamma signature of radium and its progeny. The process of cracking low molecular weight hydrocarbon gases from crude oil allows radon through but leaves radium behind. The radon enters the process piping and decays, depositing its short-lived decay products or progeny. When the short-lived progeny decay, all that is left are alpha and beta emitters. When this occurs, measurements taken oil the outside of piping indicate no elevated levels of gamma radiation, however, elevated levels of alpha and beta radiation can be detected on the inside of the piping. Pb-210 is usually the only gamma emitter detected on the inside of the piping and, its gamma ray energy is such that little if any penetrates the walls of the piping. Since one of the release criterion for piping material is all external dose rate of less than 50 mu R h(-1), it is possible that a survey from the outside of the piping can be negative when, in fact, thee can be appreciable contamination on the inside of the piping.

J	Maldonado, GI				Maldonado, GI			Optimizing LWR cost of margin one fuel pin at a time	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						nuclear fuel management; optimization	MANAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION PACKAGE; GENERALIZED PERTURBATION-THEORY; FORMOSA-B	Approximately one year before a single UO2 fuel pellet is pressed and fresh fuel assemblies manufactured, design calculations are performed to effectively guarantee the performance of a light water reactor (LWR) core for an upcoming fuel cycle. Energy requirements must be fulfilled in conjunction with all other reactivity, thermal, and operational limits. Furthermore, several months prior to a reactor startup, the proposed core must be licensed by the regulating authority. Therefore, all built-in design conservatisms (i.e., target margins) established a priori must satisfy all safety, operational, and regulatory constraints, a posteriori. The magnitude of target margins directly impacts cycle energy efficiency, which is why this design cushion is often referred to as the "cost of margin" because it ultimately affects the cost per generated kilowatt-hour by a LWR. This article illustrates the modern role of nuclear fuel management optimization in the LWR core reload design process, highlighting some of the history and recent advancements in the field, particularly, in the area of pin-by-pin optimization. Also, important limitations are highlighted to help define the new level of sophistication which the field must conquer for designers to ultimately be able to optimize LWRs "one fuel pin at a time.''

The absorption coefficients induced by the irradiation were calculated and analyzed. Crystals also underwent light yield (LY) and scintillation decay measurements using the Am-241 and Na-22 radioactive sources in 1 mu s time gate. The induced absorption at 550 nm (at the Ce3+ luminescence peak) decreases with Ce concentration and further decrease is obtained in the Si4+-codoped samples. LY values are independent on the Ce3+ concentration within 0.12% -0.3% and on the moderate Si4+ codoping as well.

In this study, tungsten rods were irradiated at the 800 MeV Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) proton accelerator for six months. After irradiation to a maximum dose in the tungsten of 23.3 dpa at T-irr = 50-270 degrees C, the rods were sliced into sections, hardness tests were performed at room temperature, and compression tests were performed at room temperature and at 475 degrees C to assess the effect of irradiation on the mechanical properties of tungsten. The results show an increase in strength and a decrease in ductility with dose. Specimens tested at 475 degrees C had lower yield strength and reduced work hardening capability compared to specimens tested at room temperature. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Three of materials were made by sintering of tungsten powder with purity of 99.999%, (5N-W), 99.99% (PF-W) and 99.95% (N-W). and one wits it chemical vapor deposited tungsten of 99.9999%, (CVD-W) purity. The formation of interstitial type dislocation loops is Observed above room temperature by electron irradiation. In sintered tungsten, the number density of loops increases with increasing density of impurity atoms, i.e., N-W > PF-W > 5N-W. The density of loops in CVD-W is relatively high, contrary to its purity, In CVD-W, a heterogeneous formation of loops is observed at above 573 K. Loops are aligned on layers, and no loops, are formed between the layers. All four types of specimens have a change in slop of the temperature dependence of loop number density at around 500 K which is caused by impurity atoms. Results of radioactivation analysis and hardness testing are also presented. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The database consists of U-Zr-Fe-O-C-B-(FP oxides) system. Fundamentally, data were obtained from existing assessed databases, such as SGTE's. The liquid phase data were reconstructed based on the ionic model and lacking data including excess energies were assessed to be consistent with existing phase diagrams. Liquidus temperatures measured under OECD RASPLAV project were analyzed with the database. In addition, an analysis of corium under a severe accident condition was carried out and demonstrates that the database gives an improved method based on thermodynamics to analyze the corium stratification.

The transfer reaction was plasma-chemically catalyzed by allowing a gas mixture such as H2O/D-2, D2O/H-2, H2O/HDO/H-2 or H2O/D2O/HDO/H-2 to flow through an atmospheric pressure discharge zone formed in a reaction chamber, the inner temperature of which was maintained just above 100 degrees C. The plasma-chemical reactions diagnosed by infrared and emission spectroscopy revealed that the mixture underwent instantaneous deuterium transfer reactions as it passed the zone. The effectiveness of the method was demonstrated by high deuterium transfer rate, high separation factor of the transfer and a possibility of miniaturizing the separation facility.

And we have carried out several numerical experiments under different atmospheric conditions. The results are summarized as follows: (1) Wind stress transferred through the sea surface does not always have an influence on every area in the ocean, but the influence of wind stress on mean current variation is not negligible, especially over shallow water. (2) Sea surface winds tend to have a greater impact on the dispersion of radioactivity contaminants than normal sea currents. (3) The calculation time for the CPU is about 15% less for this combination system than for systems without the coupling library Stampi.

It has been shown that both prompt and delayed gamma-rays from neutron capture and fission product decay can be used to analyze uranium concentrations and U-235 enrichment. Detection of neutrons from the spontaneous fission of U-238 has also been demonstrated for uranium analysis. The observation of high-energy gamma-rays following the decay of short-lived fission products is a sensitive indication of fissile material, and the ratio of fission product gamma-ray intensities can uniquely determine the concentrations of fission isotopes.

The measured ranges of activity concentrations for Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 were 36.9-51.9, 52.5-67.6 and 680-784 Bq center dot kg(-1), respectively. Associated external dose was calculated using Monte Carlo simulation technique. A theoretical model to determine the gamma dose rate at 1 m height from the sand was employed for calculation the mass attenuation coefficient and self absorption in sand slab for the gamma-energies of these radionuclides and their progeny. The weighted average values of the measured gamma dose rates were 3.3, 4.5 and 12.4 nGyh(-1) for Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40, respectively, with effective dose of 0.022 +/- 0.004 mSv center dot y(-1). Monte Carlo simulation shows that the sand slabs having more than 15 cm effective thickness contribute very little to the external gamma dose rate. The values of the external dose rate and annual effective dose were found to be much lower than the world average as well as from other countries of the world.

During the radiological characterization of a former laboratory a significant contamination of actinide elements in the old liquid effluents system was found. Samples obtained from two different locations (pipes and deposit) were measured by gamma- and alpha-spectrometry to quantify the contamination of the system. A quick and simple method using Actinide resin coupled with liquid scintillation counting (LSC) was employed for the determination of gross-alpha activity. The samples were also analyzed using a sequential leaching procedure to obtain information about the actinide association to certain geochemical phases with different solubilities such as carbonates,oxides, organic matter, etc., and thus, to choose the most appropriate clean-up method. Finally, the results obtained by the different techniques mentioned are compared and discussed.

NOM is a poly-functional,poly-electrolytic, heterogeneous amalgam of organic molecules of varying molecular weight and size. The NOM constitute an important pool of ligands for complexing metals. The size fractionation of dissolved NOM is achieved based on their nominal molecular weight cut-off limit{NMWL} by using ultra-filtration technique. Samples of ground water were collected from five different locations. After filtering through a 0.45 mu m filter by using suction filtration, various physicochemical characteristics of the water were measured by using ion chromatography. Dissolved organic carbon(DOC) in ground waters were measured by a total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer. The levels of total DOC in the ground water were in the range of 10.42-17.83 ppm. The solution obtained from filtration through <0.45 mu m, was sequentially passed through the ultra-filtration membranes having pore diameter of 14 nm (300 k NMWL), 3.1 nm (50 k NMWL), 2.2 nm (30 k NMWL), 1.6 nm (10k NMWL) and 1.1 nm (0.5k NMWL) by using stirred ultra-filtration cells, operated in concentration mode. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) that passed through 10,000 NMWL filter, i.e., approximately 1.6 nm filter, consisted mainly of fulvic acid and accounts for 70% DOC. The concentration of uranium in various fractions was measured by a laser fluorimeter in which a pulsed nitrogen laser is used to excite uranyl species at 337.1 nm. Maximum natural uranium in the ground aquatic environment is found to be bound on low molecular weight humus colloids, i.e., 30 k NMWL followed by 10 k and 0.5 k NMWL.

The experimental results were found to fit the BET isotherm and show a higher affinity of the TVEX-PHOR resin towards the extraction of uranium than thorium under similar experimental conditions. The best separation of uranium from thorium is obtained from 3M sulphuric acid at V/m ratio of 20 ml/g. Elution of loaded uranium and thorium was carried out with 1M sodium carbonate and 0.075M sulphuric acid, respectively. After the elution of both elements, the regenerated resin could be reused with high efficiency.

One advantage of the X-ray irradiator is that the photon energies below a few keV, which may cause an error in the equivalent dose value, can be eliminated by an aluminum absorber. Data is presented to establish the optimum thickness of the aluminum absorber, found to be about 50 mu m.

J	Zagar, T; Ravnik, M				Zagar, T; Ravnik, M			Positive temperature reactivity coefficient of a TRIGA reactor at room temperature	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article							II BENCHMARK EXPERIMENT; ACTIVATION PRODUCTS; FUEL-ELEMENTS; OPERATION; BURNUP	A positive isothermal temperature reactivity coefficient has been measured at zero power conditions at the TRIGA research reactor of the J. Stefan Institute in Ljubljana. The coefficient is measured in a critical reactor for different core configurations at room temperature and at low power. The reactor is filled with standard, 20% enriched, fuel elements containing 12 wt% uranium with 6% average burn-up. The experiments are analysed by reactor calculations using WIMSD code to provide the reactor physics explanations of the results measured. The positive temperature reactivity effect can be explained by reduced absorption in water prevailing at low fuel temperature over negative temperature effects on the reactivity in the fuel elements. The positive effect is due to the thermal spectrum shift in water and is not the consequence of a change in water density. The positive effect decreases with increasing temperature. The negative reactivity effect in fuel prevails at fuel temperatures above 50 degrees C. The positive isothermal temperature reactivity coefficient has no effect on normal reactor operation in steady state and pulse mode.

A protective liquid droplet jet zone of 2 m thickness is used as coolant, energy carrier and breeder Flibe as the main constituent is mixed with increased mole-fractions of heavy metal salt (ThF4 or UF4) starting by 2 moles% up to 12 moles%. Spectrum softening within the inertial confinement system reduces the tritium production ratio (TBR) in the protective coolant to a lower level than unity. However additional tritium production in the (Li2DT)-Li-6 zone of the system increases TBR to values above unity and allows a continuous operation of the power plant with a self-sustained fusion fuel supply. By modest fusion fuel burn efficiencies (40 to 60%) and with a few mol. % of heavy metal salt in the coolant in form of ThF4 or % UF4, a satisfactory TBR of > 1.05 can be realized. In addition to that, excess fissile fuel of extremely high isotopic purity with a rate of similar to 1000 kg/year of U-233 or Pu-239 can be produced.

Since the decontamination processes for the materials of the water-cooled reactor (WWER-440) secondary circuits are in the progress of development, it is necessary to draw the needed information by the measurement and analysis of the real specimens [Cohen, L., 1980. Application of Mossbauer Spectroscopy, vol. II. Academic Press, NY, USA]. The corrosion layers were separated by scraping the rust off the surface and the powder samples were studied by transmission Mossbauer spectroscopy. It should be noted that the gamma spectroscopic measurements give no evidence of the presence of low-energy gamma radiation emitted from the samples. The scrapped specimen powder was homogenised (using the 50 mu m sieve) and fixed into the special holder. The (57)CO in Rh matrix was used as the radioactive Mossbauer source. Measured spectra were fitted using program NORMOS SITE. According to the results obtained from Mossbauer spectra, it is possible to establish that the main component of secondary circuit's corrosion products is magnetite Fe(3)O(4). Next components are hematite (alpha-Fe(2)O(3) and hydro-oxide akagenite (beta-FeOOH, which is characterised by significant paramagnetic doublet in the middle of spectra. The sextets corresponding to base materials (martenzite and austenite steels) were identified in all measured spectra. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It provides very good energy and spatial resolution at the same time. The DEPFET pixel cells consist of p-channel JFETs integrated into the high-ohmic it-silicon substrate, This leads to it very low noise performance at room temperature. Two dedicated ASIC chips have been developed for steering and readout of the pixel matrix. The measured system noise of (69 +/- 4)e(-) at 35 degrees C is mostly due to sensor leakage current and can be largely reduced by cooling or a faster readout. The spatial resolution is examined by measurements with a laser as well as with a dedicated test chart and is determined to be (6.7 +/- 0.7) mu m for 6 keV-X-ravs and 4.3 +/- 0.8 mu m for 22 keV-X-rays. The measurements are compared to simulation results with different reconstruction algorithms. Due to the thin entrance window at the detector backside and the low noise performance, a detection of low-energy beta-emitters such as 3 H is possible, Measurements with H-3-labeled biological samples were taken, The ability of the DEPFET pixel Bioscope to separate different radiolabels in the same sample is demonstrated by a measurement with H-3 and C-14.

This process may be needed for locating a source in a scrap or waste container. Simple functions for location determination can be developed for the non-absorbing and pure-absorbing media, but for the general case, a more sophisticated method must be used. A simple and practical algorithm was developed, which can predict the location of a point source in a bulk volume quite accurately, with an average possible deviation of up to about 1 cm, except for extreme combinations of dimension and absorption coefficient. but also in this case the maximal expected deviations are not more than several centimeters. The algorithm was checked experimentally for several bulk volumes with length of up to about 50cm and with different length/absorption coefficient combinations, The experimental validation was performed for a great range Of absorption coefficients (from mu = 0.0001 to 0.2cm(-1)). covering the practical range of waste containers compositions, (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Fibre diffraction therefore has broad application to the study of a wide range of biological and synthetic polymers. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the general scope of the method and in particular to demonstrate the impact of a combined approach involving both X-ray and neutron diffraction methods. While the flux of modern X-ray synchrotron radiation sources allows high quality datasets to be recorded with good resolution within a very short space of time, neutron studies can provide unique information through the ability to locate hydrogen or deuterium atoms that are often difficult or impossible to locate using X-ray methods. Furthermore, neutron fibre diffraction methods can, through the ability to selectively label specific parts of a structure, be used to highlight novel aspects of polymer structure that can not be studied using X-rays. Two examples are given. The first describes X-ray and neutron diffraction studies of conformational transitions in DNA. The second describes structural studies of the synthetic high-performance polymer poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide) (PPTA), known commercially as Kevlar (R) or Twaron (R). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

A comprehensive study was performed considering 12-, 18-, and 24-month fuel cycles over a wide range of discharge burnups. A neutronic study was performed followed by an economic evaluation. The first phase of the study limited the fuel enrichments used in the study to <5 Wt% U-235 consistent with constraints today. The second phase extended the range of discharge burnups for 18-month cycles by using fuel enriched in excess of 5 wt%. The neutronic study used state-of-the-art reactor physics methods to accurately determine enrichment requirements. Energy requirements were consistent with today's high capacity factors (>98%) and short (15-day) refueling outages. The economic evaluation method considers various component costs including uranium, conversion, enrichment, fabrication and spent-fuel storage costs as well as the effect of discounting of the revenue stream. The resulting fuel cycle costs as a function of cycle length and discharge burnup are presented and discussed. Fuel costs decline with increasing discharge burnup for all cycle lengths up to the maximum discharge burnup considered. The choice of optimum cycle length depends on assumptions for outage costs.
