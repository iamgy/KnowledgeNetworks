The respective standard potentials of Pu(III)/Pu redox couple, -2.54 V and -2.51 V (versus Cl-/Cl-2 reference electrode), led to the calculation of the activity coefficients of Pu(III) in each electrolyte. In CaCl2 the complexation of Pu(III) ions is lower and the voltage gap between Pu(III)/Pu redox system and the solvent limit is higher. Use of these results to construct potential-pO(2-) diagrams for plutonium at 1073 K gives a rational overview of plutonium properties in these media. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The electrochemical properties of Ce and Pu in gallium metal and chlorides media - CaCl2 and equimolar NaCl-KCl - have been studied at 1073 K. Cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry show the thermodynamic feasibility of using gallium as solvent metal for pyrochemical processes involving Pu and Cc. The activity coefficient of Pu in liquid Ga (log(gamma(Pu,Ga)) = -7.3 +/- 0.5) is deduced from the results and is a basis of assessing the potential for using liquid metals in pyrochemical separation of actinides and lanthanides. Evaluation of literature data for Al, Bi and Cd suggests that Ga is most favorable for selective separation of Pu from Ce near 1073 K. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This work investigates potential alteration mechanisms of UO2 in contact with groundwater ions (Ca2+, CO32-, and silicate) under anoxic conditions, at ambient (25 degrees C) and hydrothermal (180 degrees C) temperature conditions. SEM-EDX analysis detected (in the case of treatment at 180 degrees C in high silicate content solutions) a compound with U:Si ratio of 1:1 on the UO2 surfaces after leaching. Minor quantities of phases containing U, Ti, Fe, Si, and Ca were formed, these could not be characterized completely. A further experiment, performed in the presence of dissolving CaO/TiO,/SiO2/Fe(0)-Fe2O3, formed a compound with U:Si:Ca of 1:2:8, a ratio not matching any known uranyl compound. The two phases, possibly identical with coffinite, USA, and U-bearing ekanite, UCa2Si8O20, were found to form at different [Ca]/[Si] conditions. The implications upon the final geologic storage of actual, heterogeneous spent fuel are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Borysow, J; Fink, M				Borysow, J; Fink, M			NIR Raman spectrometer for monitoring protonation reactions in gaseous hydrogen	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							DEUTERIUM; PD	Spontaneous Raman spectroscopy was used to monitor molecular hydrogen isotope exchange reactions between H-2, D-2, and HD. A tunable 780 nm, multimode laser diode with power output between 300 and 500 mW served as the excitation source. Hydrogen isotopes could be detected at partial pressure of 13 Pa (number density 3.2 x 10(21) m(-3)) at total gas pressure of 5.3 x 10(4) Pa (number density 1.3 x 10(25) m(-3)) with signal-to-noise better than 2 during minutes long observations. The high sensitivity was achieved using multiple pass cell in conjunction with atomic vapor Rb absorption filter employed to eliminate Rayleigh scattered laser light. We have used the new spectrometer to measure the rapid isotope exchange reactions taking place in the palladium hydrogen purifier. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

BRIC is an Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) type ion charge state breeder in which a radio frequency (RF) quadrupolar field has been superimposed in the trapped ion region to introduce a selective containment with the aim of increasing the wanted ion trapping efficiency. A code that studies the motion and the ion charge state evolution in the trap region of the BRIC device has been recently developed in the Bari INFN section. That code has the aim of showing if, in the presence of an axial magnetic field and electron beam space charge force, the RF quadrupole field can still give a selective ion containment in the EBIS trap region. The code, furthermore, should allow choosing the RF quadrupole parameters to optimize the ion charge containment efficiency. In this paper the main feature of the code, named BRICTEST, and the simulation test will be presented and shortly discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Deptuch, G				Deptuch, G			Tritium autoradiography with thinned and back-side illuminated monolithic active pixel sensor device	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						monolithic active pixel sensors; CMOS; pixel detectors; autoradiography; tritium	CHARGED-PARTICLE TRACKING; DIGITAL AUTORADIOGRAPHY; SILICON; DETECTORS; PERFORMANCE; NOISE	The first autoradiographic results of the tritium (H-3) marked source obtained with monolithic active pixel sensors are presented. The detector is a high-resolution, back-side illuminated imager, developed within the SUCIMA collaboration for low-energy (< 30 keV) electrons detection. The sensitivity to these energies is obtained by thinning the detector, originally fabricated in the form of a standard VLSI chip, down to the thickness of the epitaxial layer. The detector used is the 1 x 10(6) pixel, thinned MIMOSA V chip. The low noise performance and thin (similar to 160 nm) entrance window provide the sensitivity of the device to energies as low as similar to 4 keV. A polymer tritium source was parked directly atop the detector in open-air conditions. A real-time image of the source was obtained. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hollas, CL; Goulding, C; Myers, W				Hollas, CL; Goulding, C; Myers, W			Determination of neutron multiplication of subcritical HEU systems using delayed neutrons	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						fission of highly enriched uranium; neutron multiplication; nondestructive analysis of HEU	FISSION	This report presents a new method for the nondestructive analysis of highly enriched uranium (HEU). The method uses a source of 14-MeV neutrons to induce fission in the HEU sample. The 14-MeV neutron source is pulsed at a rate of 50 Hz. Between pulses, neutrons are detected with a medium-efficiency 3 He-based neutron detector. These neutrons are delayed neutrons from fission products that result from HEU fission events induced during the pulse and from fission events induced by the delayed neutrons from the fission products. The time history of neutron detection is recorded and subsequently analyzed according to the Feymnan reduced variance method to yield rates of detection of one (N1/s), two (N2/s), and three (N3/s) neutrons from fission events. Ratios of (N2/s)/(N1/s) and (N3/s)/(N1/s) are compared with model calculations to extract the neutron multiplication. The rate N1/s is used to deduce the HEU system mass. Measurements were performed on a set of spherical HEU samples enriched to 93% metal. The samples were assembled from a set of nesting hollow hemispheres. The mass of the HEU samples ranged from 592 to 13 722 g. Experimentally determined total neutron multiplications for the HEU samples were compared with calculations performed with the ONEDANT code. Overall agreement was better than 5%. Experimentally determined mass values agreed with the stated mass values to better than 5%. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The products were separated and identified with the GSI fragment separator (FRS) and implanted into a stack of Si detectors. Measurements were performed of implantation decay correlations of nuclei with half-lives in the range of 0.1-100ms. Yields of very neutron-deficient protactinium, thorium and actinium isotopes were measured and yield extrapolations imply that with the availability of a beam intensity of 10(9) ions/s, projectile fragmentation of relativistic U-238 can be an effective method to access new nuclear species including possible proton emitters in the suburanium region.

The combination of the six directly measurable quantities as obtained from the three measurement techniques, namely the thermal power P from calorimetry, the effective mass m(240eff) of Pu-240 from neutron coincidence counting (NCC), and the plutonium isotope ratios 238/239, 240/239 and 241/239 and Am-241/239 from high-resolution gamma spectrometry (HRGS) allow to determine the Pu-242 isotope abundance, which otherwise cannot be directly obtained from a HRGS measurement. In this manner the CANEGA measurement approach provides a more complete fingerprint for any plutonium-bearing sample under assay, which in turn helps to improve the overall accuracy of the plutonium mass determination. Pertinent features and performances of the individual and combined measurement techniques are presented and discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Americium was isolated from the irradiated MOX fuel by a combined method of anion-exchange chromatography and oxidation of Am. The isotopic ratios of americium and its content were determined by thermal ionization mass spectroscopy and &alpha;-spectrometry, respectively. The americium isotopic ratio was similar for all the specimens, but was significantly different from that of PWR-MOX On the basis of present analytical results, the accumulation and transmutation behavior of americium nuclides in a fast reactor is discussed from the viewpoints of neutron spectrum dependence and the isomeric ratio of the Am-241 capture reaction. The estimated isomeric ratio is about 87%, which is close to the latest evaluated value.

Optimization of I-131 production in Tehran research reactor (TRR) was studied by two different methods. Primarily, standard nuclear codes such as ORIGEN, WIMS and CITATION were applied and then analytical solutions technique was followed. Calculated results and experimental works in the bench scale indicate that, by irradiation of 100 g natural Uranium (UO2) for 100 h at 3.5 x 10(13) (n's/cm(2) s) thermal neutron flux in the TRR, one can produce about 5 Ci of I-131 for medical purposes, on the other hand can produce very useful radionuclides like Mo-99 and Xe-133 in one batch irradiation in the unique production line. &COPY; 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Bismuth-213 is obtained from a radionuclide generator system from decay of 10-days Ac-225 parent. Recent pre-clinical studies have also shown the potential application of both Bi-213, and the Ac-225 parent radionuclide in a variety of cancer systems and targeted radiotherapy. This paper describes our five years of experience in production of Ac-225 in partial support of the on-going clinical trials. A four-step chemical process, consisting of both anion and cation exchange chromatography, is utilized for routine separation of carrier-free Ac-225 from a mixture of Th-228, Th-229 and Th-232. The separation of Ra and Ac from Th is achieved using the marcoporous anion exchange resin MP1 in 8 M HNO3 media. Two sequential MP1/NO3 columns provide a separation factor of similar to 10(6) for Ra and Ac from Th. The separation of Ac from Ra is accomplished on a low cross-linking cation exchange resin AG50-X4 using 1.2 M HNO3 as eluant. Two sequential AG50/NO3 columns provide a separation factor of similar to 10(2) for Ac from Ra. A 60-day processing schedule has been adopted in order to reduce the processing cost and to provide the highest levels of Ac-225 possible. Over an 8-week campaign, a total of similar to 100 mCi of Ac-225 (similar to 80% of the theoretical yield) is shipped in 5-6 batches, with the first batch typically consisting of similar to 50 mCi. After the initial separation and purification of Ac, the Ra pool is re-processed on a bi-weekly schedule or as needed to provide smaller batches of Ac-225. The averaged radioisotopic purity of the Ac-225 was 99.6 +/- 0.7% with a Ra-225 content of <= 0.6%, and an average Th-229 content of (4(-4)(+5)) x 10(-5)%. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Data on natural and artificial radionuclides are very scarce in Antarctica and the studied soil samples can be representative of the maritime Antarctic environment. Byers Peninsula has an extensive presence of permafrost and an active layer, the studied soils being Criosols and Cryie Leptosols. A series of soil cores between 13 and 40 cm depth have been collected in different lithological and altitudinal contexts. In the southwestern sector of the peninsula, soils have been sampled in seven different sites along a transect on different geomorphological units from an upper marine platform (88 m above sea level) to a Holocene raised beach at an altitude of 24 m a.s.l. The parent materials are mainly Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous marine sandstones and conglomerates and Lower Cretaceous volcanoclastic materials. Individual samples have been obtained from the cores according to textural and colour criteria and analysed for U-238, Ra-226, Th-232 K-40 and Cs-137 by gamma spectrometry. Radionuclides show variations in the depth profile as well as in the different morphoedaphic environments studied. Variability in some radionuclides seems to be related to mineralogy derived from parent materials as well as with cryogenic and soil processes affecting the depth distribution of the granulometric fractions and the organic matter.

The lack of the required experimental data in this field makes it impossible to describe the kinetics of the behavior of the indicated hexafluorides in the various processes involved in obtaining and reprocessing them. Consequently, the study of the adsorption of uranium and plutonium hexafluorides and the determination of the heat and entropy of adsorption are of interest from the scientific standpoint and for applications. This paper is devoted to the study of these questions.								DROBYSHEVSKII YV, 2002, ATOM ENERG, V93, P40; Erilov P.

The active layer (the natural nuclear reactor operating on fast neutrons in lakes) can form when. uranium oxides or carbides precipitate from a liquid layer onto the Earth's solid interior core. A mechanism of uranium concentration in the Earth's core is studied, experiments are performed, and it is shown that a nuclear chain reaction with breeding of fissioning nuclides could have occurred in such a layer The basic neutron-physical characteristics of such a natural nuclear reactor are calculated. It most likely operates in a pulsed mode. The critical condition for the duration of the reaction is the power level. It is found that for certain optimal power this process in the Earth's core can last for more than 4 billion years up to the present time.

J	[Anonymous]				[Anonymous]			Permit issued for expansion of the gronau uranium enrichment plant	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								Over the next few years, the Gronau Uranium Enrichment Plant (UAG) will be able to raise its capacity in steps from 1800 tonnes to 4500 tonnes SWU per annum. This development in steps depends on the extent to which demand on the world market can be turned into contracts for Urenco. After a procedure taking more than six years to complete, Urenco Deutschland GmbH was issued the required permit by the North Rhine-Westphalian State Ministry for Transport, Energy, and Planning on February 14 this year. The permit was preceded by the drafting and examination of two safety reports of several hundred pages each, and of over 1000 detailed documents. The application documents were examined by a large number of expert consultants and public authorities from all over Germany acting on behalf of the nuclear licensing authority. Urenco Ltd. sells enrichment services worldwide, at present holding a share of approx. 19% of the world market for uranium separative work. Although this world market is not going to grow for a foreseeable period of time, Urenco is expanding its capacities. This is based on the latest centrifuge technology characterized by extremely low power consumption and high availability. It replaces diffusion technology, which currently holds a share of approx. 40% of the world market.									0	0	0	0	0	VERLAGSGRP HANDELSBLATT GMBH	DUSSELDORF	POSTFACH 10 11 02, D-40002 DUSSELDORF, GERMANY	1431-5254			ATW-INT J NUCL POWER	ATW-Int.

J	Fritschi, M				Fritschi, M			Nuclear waste management in Switzerland - Survey and status of activities	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article; Proceedings Paper	General Meeting of the Swiss-Association-for-Atomic-Energy	OCT   14, 2004	Bern, SWITZERLAND	Swiss Assoc Atom Energy				Major problems in nuclear waste management have been solved unnoticed by the general public. Registration and characterization of radioactive waste arisings and their interim storage are routine steps. The waste arising is now converted into a product resistant to leaching, i.e. conditioned, which product is fit for permanent underground storage at some later point in time. The new Nuclear Power Act, which entered into force on February 1, 2005, imposes clear political boundary conditions on the solution to be found for the geologic underground storage of radioactive waste. After some thirty years of studies and research, comprehensive knowledge and a basis for decisionmaking have been elaborated for this final step in the waste management chain. The demonstration of high-level waste disposal facilities filed in late 2002 constitutes conclusive basic proof of permanent, safe management of all radioactive waste in Switzerland. A region for siting a high-level waste disposal facility has been proposed which has clear geological advantages over other options identified and found to be feasible before. Designing and building the required geologic repositories is not only a technical but also a political challenge. The federal authorities are obliged to define, at an early point in time, process steps and criteria so as to establish a politically acceptable site selection procedure. A technical plan on geologic repositories is under preparation. It ensures, in particular, the early involvement of cantons, municipalities and authorities also of neighboring countries as well as that of the public and of stakeholder organizations. On the basis of the criteria spelt out in the technical plan, a management program for all waste categories is to be submitted to the Federal Council immediately for approval. The technical basis is now available, allowing the design and construction of the required facilities to be carried out without delay.

Since alumina has the capability of tritium permeation reduction, the development of such coatings on ferritic martensitic steels by different techniques like hot-dip aluminizing (HDA) by Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Germany (FZK) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) by Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique, France (CEA) was funded by the European Commission (EC) during the last 10 years. The final objective was to identify a so-called reference coating for structural components of a lithium-lead cooled blanket. This paper describes the process specifications and the results of the corresponding hydrogen permeation measurements, performed at ENEA, Brasimone, Italy. The results for CVD and HDA coating showed clearly, that Permeation Reduction Factor's (PRF) of > 1000 were sufficiently exceeded in H-2 gas, but much lower values were obtained in the Pb-17Li melt. The post mortem analysis revealed that surface imperfections and spallation of parts of the coatings were responsible for the too low PRFs. Because of shifting of priorities and changes in the blanket design from WCLL to HCLL, the EU funding of all major R&D activities was postponed in 2002 until the redesign of the European Blanket Concepts was finished.

Although it is difficult to anticipate the regulatory regime in which future fusion power stations will be licensed, the areas of public and occupational safety and short and long-term environmental impact are likely to remain important. In each of these areas, the outcome of various studies have been reviewed, leading to a list of issues which should be given attention to facilitate eventual licensing of a fusion power plant. Many of these relate to reducing conservatisms and uncertainties in the analyses, but also included are improved understanding of tritium retention and of dust generation, and development of materials to provide long component lifetimes. A full appraisal is also recommended of the viability of recycling of active materials after end of plant life.

Initial contributions were made to the Conceptual Design Activities in the late 1980's. Both R&D and design contributions were made to the Engineering Design Activity in the 1990's. As ITER now moves to construction, the US is slated to build and deliver the Tokamak Exhaust Processing (TEP) system. The main purpose of this system is to recover hydrogen isotopes including those bound in molecules such as water and methane, and deliver purified hydrogen isotopes to the isotope separation system. The TEP construction activity will begin with finalizing the detailed design. Then industry will fabricate the system. This will be followed with factory testing, transportation to the ITER site, installation and final acceptance testing. This system is highly integrated with other Tritium Plant subsystems, so close interactions are expected with other procurement package owners and the ITER International team.

This comparison is on a limited set of components, but there is a good variety of data sets in the comparison. The data compared reasonably well. The most reasonable failure rate values are recommended for use on next generation tritium handling system components, such as those in the tritium plant systems for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor and the tritium fuel systems of inertial fusion facilities, such as the US National Ignition Facility. These data and the comparison results are also shared with the International Energy Agency cooperative task on fusion component failure rate data.

An analysis was conducted to estimate the radioactive corrosion products with a design code ACT-4 developed in JAERI, the activation cross sections based on the FENDL library and the IEAF-2001 library, the latest version of nuclear activation data in the intermediate energy range up to 150 MeV The result says the concentration of the corrosion in lithium is not very large compared with that of Be-7. However, the behavior of the nuclides such as accumulation and detachment on material has not been clarified yet. When the dose rate around the lithium loop was estimated under the condition of 100% plate-out, the value was beyond the acceptable level for the hands-on maintenance near the loop soon after the operation stop. It means that a very efficient cold trap is required so that the 90% activity in the lithium loop is removed.

The goal of scaling is to ensure that changes in structural response and performance caused by changes in size and operating conditions do not reduce the usefulness of the tests. Initially, constitutive equations are applied to lay out the basic operating and design parameters that dominate blanket phenomena. The suitability of these similarity criteria for the TBM design is then confirmed by comparing finite element predictions Of prototype and scale model responses. The TBM design also takes into account the need to check the codes and data for future design use. Specifically, predictability of tritium production and nuclear heating rates in a complex geometry, tritium release and permeation characteristics under fusion environments belong to this category. We conclude that this engineering scaling design process has maximized the value of ITER testing.

The three ports assigned for testing will test several blanket concepts proposed by the various parties with test blanket modules (TBM) that utilize different breeders and coolants. Nevertheless, neutronics issues to be resolved in ITER-TBM are generic in nature and are important to each TBM type. Dedicated neutronics tests specifically address the accuracy involved in predicting key neutronics parameters such as tritium production rate, TPR, volumetric heating rate, induced activation and decay heat, and radiation damage to the reactor components. In this paper, we address some strategies for performing the neutronics tests. Tritium self-sufficiency cannot be confirmed by testing in ITER, however, the testing can provide valuable information regarding the main parameters needed to assess the feasibility of achieving tritium self-sufficiency. The paper also addresses the operational requirement (i.e. flux and fluence) as well as the geometrical requirement of the test module (i.e. minimum size) in order to have meaningful and useful tests. Measured neutronics data require high spatial resolution. This necessitates that the measured quantity be as flat as possible in the innermost locations inside the test module. This requirement has been confirmed in the present work based on results from two-dimensional calculations. The US and Japan solid breeder test blanket modules are placed inside half a port in ITER. The R-theta model used accounts for the presence of the ITER shielding blanket and the surrounding-frame of the port.

The Monte Carlo calculation results for the integrated tritium productions agree well with the experimental data within 2 and 11% for the mockups without the armor in the experiments without and with the neutron reflector, respectively. It is clarified that the tritium production can be very accurately predicted in the experiment without the reflector. In the mockups with the 12.6 and 25.2 mm thick tungsten armors, it is experimentally clarified that the integrated tritium productions are reduced by 3 and 6% relative to the case without the armor, respectively.

Lithium ceramics have received a significant interest as tritium breeders for the fusion blankets during the last three decades. The thermal performance of the lithium ceramic pebble beds plays a key role for the fusion blankets. In order to study the heat transfer in the blanket, the effective thermal conductivity of the lithium ceramics pebble beds has to be well measured and characterized. The data of effective thermal conductivity of lithium ceramic pebble beds is important for the blanket design. Several studies have been dedicated to investigate the effective conductivity of the lithium ceramics pebble beds. The objective of this work is to review and compare the available data, presented by various studies, of effective conductivity of lithium ceramic pebble beds in order to address the current status of these data.

The technology to economically manufacture and then position cryogenic targets at chamber center is at the heart of future IFE power plants. For direct drive IFE (laser fusion), energy is applied directly to the surface of a spherical CH polymer capsule containing the deuterium-tritium (DT) fusion fuel at approximately 18 K. For indirect drive (heavy ion fusion, HIF), the target consists of a similar fuel capsule within a cylindrical metal container or "hohlraum" which converts the incident driver energy into x-rays to implode the capsule. For either target, it must be accurately delivered to the target chamber center at a rate of about 5-10 Hz, with a precisely predicted target location. Future successful fabrication and injection systems must operate at the low cost required for energy production (about $0.25/target, about 10(4) less than current costs). Z-pinch driven IFE (ZFE) utilizes high current pulses to compress plasma to produce x-rays that indirectly heat a fusion capsule. ZFE target technologies utilize a repetition rate of about 0.1 Hz with a higher yield. This paper provides an overview of the proposed target methodologies for laser fusion, HIF, and ZFE, and summarizes advances in the unique materials science and technology development programs.

This thermal loading could cause phase change (vaporization and/or melting) of the deuterium-tritium (DT). In the past, it was assumed that any phase change would result in a violation of the stringent smoothness and symmetry requirements imposed on the target. This work summarizes the results from a one-dimensional finite difference model that was created to simulate the coupled thermal and mechanical response of a direct drive target to an imposed heat flux. The objective of this work is to investigate methods of increasing the thermal robustness of targets.

The University of Wisconsin (UW) operates two IEC devices: a cylindrical aluminum chamber and a spherical, water-cooled, stainless-steel chamber, with a power supply capable of 75 mA and 200 kV. The research program aims to generate fusion reaction products for various applications, including protons for creating radioisotopes for nuclear medicine and neutrons for detecting clandestine materials. Most IEC devices worldwide, including the UW devices, presently operate primarily in a pressure range (1-10 mtorr) that allows ions to make only a few passes through the core before they charge exchange and lose substantial energy or they collide with cathode grid wires. It is believed that fusion rates can be raised by operating at a pressure where neutral gas does not impede ion flow, and a helicon ion source has been developed to explore operation at pressures of similar to 0.05 mtorr. The UW IEC research group uses proton detectors, neutron detectors, residual gas analyzers, and spectroscopic diagnostics. New diagnostic techniques have also been developed, including eclipse disks to localize proton production and chordwires to estimate ion fluxes using power balance.

The high-energy 14.7 MeV proton generated from the reaction can activate materials for isotope production. The traditional IEC setup has been altered to generate medical isotopes using beam-target D-He-3 fusion. Beam target D-He-3 reactions in a thin-walled, water-cooled, stainless steel tube were used to create N-13, an isotope used in Positron Emission Tomography. At a maximum ion energy of 85 keV 1.0 nCi of N-13 was created as a proof of principle experiment. A scaled-up version of this concept may provide for a smaller, less expensive radioisotope generator for future commercial needs.

Tungsten coated TaC and HfC "foam", single crystal tungsten, and high-emissivity tungsten coated "foam" were compared to previous tungsten powder metallurgy samples studied in the IEC device for the High Average Power Laser (HAPL) program. Scanning electron microscopy was performed to evaluate changes in surface morphology for various ion fluences at temperatures comparable to first wall temperatures. Single crystal tungsten was shown to exhibit less damage than polycrystalline samples at a fluence of 4 x 10(16) He+/cm(2). It was found that no significant deformations occur with deuterium implantation Up to similar to 10(18) D+/cm(2) at 800 degrees C on W-coated TaC and HfC foam samples. However, helium fluences in excess of 6 x 10(17) He+/cm(2) show extensive pore formation at 800 degrees C and higher. These changes may have an impact on the lifetime of tungsten coatings on the first walls of inertial and magnetic confinement fusion reactors.

An ion source capable of delivering a similar to 10 mA He-3 ion beam into an IEC device with minimal neutral gas flow has been designed and tested Furthermore, a new IEC device that has never been operated with deuterium has been constructed to avoid D-He-3 protons from obstructing the He-3-He-3 reaction product spectrum, and to minimize Penning ionization of deuterium by excited helium, which in the past is suspected to have limited the ionized density of He. These developments 3 3 make it possible to study beam-background He-3-He-3 fusion reactions with > 300 mA recirculating ion currents.

In this paper, the electrode spacing effects on the neutron production rate (NPR) are investigated using this code by changing the cathode radius while keeping anode radius constant (17 cm). Applied voltage (-90 kV) and ion injection current (50 mA) are fixed with a deuterium pressure of 0.13 Pa, where the IECF discharge is not self-sustaining discharge and is in the ion injection mode. It is found that (1) the discharge voltage is not affected by the electrode spacing, (2) the neutron production rate increases with the increase of the cathode radius, and (3) the maximum obtained NPR with cathode radius of 10 cm is about twice of that with the 3 cm cathode.

Bone, liver, kidney, muscle and rumen contents were analyzed for uranium, radium-226 (Ra-226), lead-210 (Pb-210), and polonium-210 (Po-210). Cesium-137 (Cs-137), potassium-40 (K-40), and 27 trace metals were also measured in some tissues. Within the most active mining area, Po-210 in liver and muscle declined significantly with distance from tailings, possibly influenced by nearby natural uranium outcrops. Moose from this area had significantly higher Ra-216, Pb-210, Po-210, and Cs-137 in some edible soft tissues vs. one control area. However, soil type and diet may influence concentrations as much as uranium mining activities, given that a) liver levels of uranium, Ra-226, and Po-210 were similar to a second positive control area with mineral-rich shale hills and b) Po-210 was higher in cattle kidneys than in all moose. Enhanced food chain transfer from rumen contents to liver was found for selenium in the main mining area and for copper, molybdenum and cadmium in moose vs. cattle. Although radiological doses to moose in the main mining area were 2.6 times higher than doses to control moose or cattle, low moose intakes yielded low human doses (0.0068 mSv y(-1)), a mere 0.3% of the dose from intake of caribou (2.4 mSv y(-1)), the dietary staple in the area.

J	Apostoaei, AI				Apostoaei, AI			Testing prediction capabilities of an I-131 terrestrial transport model by using measurements collected at the Hanford Nuclear Facility	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						environmental transport; 131I; modeling; dose assessment; radiation; environmental	CHERNOBYL ACCIDENT; IODINE; RADIOACTIVITY; DEPOSITION; MILK	A model describing transport of I-131 in the environment was developed by SENES Oak Ridge, Inc., for assessment of radiation doses and excess lifetime risk from I-131 atmospheric releases from Oak Ridge Reservation in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and from Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory in southeast Idaho. This paper describes the results of an exercise designed to test the reliability of this model and to identify the main sources of uncertainty in doses and risks estimated by this model. The testing of the model was based on materials published by the International Atomic Energy Agency BIOMASS program, specifically environmental data collected after the release into atmosphere of 63 curies of I-131 during 2-5 September 1963, after an accident at the Hanford PUREX Chemical Separations Plant, in Hanford, Washington. Measurements of activity in air, vegetation, and milk were collected in nine counties around Hanford during the first couple of months after the accident. The activity of I-131 in the thyroid glands of two children was measured 47 d after the accident. The model developed by SENES Oak Ridge, Inc., was used to estimate concentrations of I-131 in environmental media, thyroid doses for the general population, and the activity of I-131 in thyroid glands of the two children. Predicted concentrations of I-131 in pasture grass and milk and thyroid doses were compared with similar estimates produced by other modelers. The SENES model was also used to estimate excess lifetime risk of thyroid cancer due to the September 1963 releases of I-131 from Hanford. The SENES model was first calibrated and then applied to all locations of interest around Hanford without fitting the model parameters to a given location. Predictions showed that the SENES model reproduces satisfactorily the time-dependent and the time-integrated measured concentrations in vegetation and milk, and provides reliable estimates of I-131 activity in thyroids of children. SENES model generated concentrations of I-131 closer to observed concentrations, as compared to the predictions produced with other models. The inter-model comparison showed that variation of thyroid doses among all participating models (SENES model included) was a factor of 3 for the general population, but a factor of 10 for the two studied children. As opposed to other models, SENES model allows a complete analysis of uncertainties in every predicted quantity, including estimated thyroid doses and risk of thyroid cancer. The uncertainties in the risk-per-unit-dose and the dose-perunit-intake coefficients are major contributors to the uncertainty in the estimated lifetime risk and thyroid dose, respectively. The largest contributors to the uncertainty in the estimated concentration in milk are the feed-to-milk transfer factor (Fm), the dry deposition velocity (Vd), and the mass interception factor (r/y)dry for the elemental form of iodine (I-2). Exposure to the 1963 PUREX/Hanford accident produced low doses and risks for people living at the studied locations. The upper 97.5th percentile of the excess lifetime risk of thyroid cancer for the most extreme situations is about 10(-4). Measurements in pasture grass and milk at all locations around Hanford indicate a very low transfer of I-131 from pasture to cow's milk (e.g., a feed-to-milk transfer coefficient, Fm, for commercial cows of about 0.0022 d L-1). These values are towards the low end of m values measured elsewhere and they are low compared to the Fm values used in other dose reconstruction studies, including the Hanford Environmental Dose Reconstruction.

J	Moeller, DW; Ryan, MT				Moeller, DW; Ryan, MT			Sensitivity analyses of the standards for the proposed Yucca Mountain repository - A review, evaluation, and commentary	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Review						dose; internal; intake; radionuclide; exposure, population; waste disposal		The standards and regulations for the proposed Yucca Mountain high level radioactive waste repository, which were developed and promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, respectively, are complex and challenging. A major reason is that they are divided into three parts, an Individual Protection Standard, a Human Intrusion Standard, and multiple Ground Water Protection Standards. Because the individual parts are not fully integrated, the one that controls under a specific set of circumstances depends on the radionuclide being evaluated, its mechanisms of transport, its avenues of intake, and differences in the specified limits. Although the coefficients in Federal Guidance Report (FGR) No. 11 are being used to estimate the doses, other sources (for example, Title 10, CFR, Part 20, and/or FGR No. 13) may deserve consideration. Since the regulations specify that the reasonably maximally exposed individual is an adult, this leaves unanswered the estimated doses to other age groups, such as infants and adolescents. Summarized in this paper are comparisons of the dose coefficients for different age groups, as well as evaluations of the sensitivity of effective and organ dose estimates for adults, depending on the source of the coefficients. All the latter analyses were based only on the consumption of ground water. While the dose estimates are different, depending on the sources of the coefficients, this was not unexpected. What these evaluations demonstrate is the caution that must be exercised to ensure that a full range of considerations is taken into account in interpreting the outcome of the dose assessments being made with respect to the proposed repository.

J	Mohammadi, H				Mohammadi, H			Radiation exposure rate from I-131-treated hyperthyroid patients - A dynamic study, with data for up to 42 D post therapy	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						thyroid; I-131; patient protection; exposure; radiation	SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS; I-131	Hyperthyroid patients treated with radioactive I-131 are a potential source of external and internal exposure to family members and others in close contact with these patients. Information on the exposure rate from the patient on any day post administration of the dosage may be helpful when implementing an effective radiation safety or ALARA strategy for the family or members of the general public. Exposure rate measurements were completed on 78 out of 128 hyperthyroid patients participating in the study. Measurements were taken at 1 m, 0.6 m, and 0.3 m from the patient for eight different dose regimens and for up to 42 d post dose administration. The measured exposure rate was plotted against days post dose administration to demonstrate how quickly the exposure rate reduced with time. As anticipated, significant positive correlation was found between exposure rate at 1 m, 0.6 m, and 0.3 m for all radioactive dose regimens. No significant correlation was found between the external exposure rate reduction post-therapy and the I-131 uptake at 2 or 24 h, prior to therapy. This work is a dynamic study that provides comprehensive external radiation exposure rate measurements in hyperthyroid patients post therapy dose administration and may serve as a database for radiation safety related decision-making.

J	Lloyd, RD; Thurman, GB; Taylor, GN; Miller, SC				Lloyd, RD; Thurman, GB; Taylor, GN; Miller, SC			Does the severity of radionuclide-induced skeletal malignancy depend upon radiation dose?	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						cancer; dogs; plutonium; skeleton		The severity of effect as a function of skeletal radiation dose for induced skeletal malignancy was investigated among a relatively large group of beagle dogs singly injected as young adults with soluble radionuclide. Bone-seeking radionuclides considered were Pu-239, Ra-226, Ra-228, Ra-224, Th-228, and Sr-90. Variables included skeletal radiation dose, tumor growth rate, maximum tumor volume, sex of the animals, growth period of the tumor, degree of calcification of the tumor, skeletal location of the tumor, year of death, and occurrence of metastases. Except for a significant relationship between tumor volume and metastatic process and for growth rate and tumor volume, no significant dependence of any two of these factors could be established. It is concluded from available data on skeletal malignancies among beagles exposed to bone-seeking radionuclides that the severity of the disease is not dependent upon skeletal radiation dose.

J	Kamboj, S; Cheng, JJ; Yu, C				Kamboj, S; Cheng, JJ; Yu, C			Deterministic vs. probabilistic analyses to identify sensitive parameters in dose assessment using RESRAD	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article								The dose assessments for sites containing residual radioactivity usually involve tire use of computer models that employ input parameters describing the physical conditions of the contaminated and surrounding media and the living and consumption patterns of the receptors in analyzing potential doses to the receptors. The precision of the dose results depends on the precision of the input parameter values. The identification of sensitive parameters that have great influence on the dose results would help set priorities in research and information gathering for parameter values so that a more precise dose assessment can be conducted. Two methods of identifying site-specific sensitive parameters, deterministic and probabilistic, were compared by applying them to the RESRAD computer code for analyzing radiation exposure for a residential former scenario. The deterministic method has difficulty in evaluating the effect of simultaneous changes in a large number or input parameters on the model output results. The probabilistic method easily identified the most sensitive parameters, but the sensitivity measure of other parameters was obscured. The choice of sensitivity analysis method would depend on the availability of site-specific data. Generally speaking, the deterministic method would identify the same set of sensitive parameters as the probabilistic method when 1) the baseline values used in the deterministic method were selected near the mean or median value of each parameter and 2) the selected range of parameter values used in the deterministic method was wide enough to cover the 5th to 95th percentile values from the distribution of that parameter.

As part of a legacy waste stream that was removed front the former Hazardous Waste Management Facility at Brookhaven National Laboratory, the 'Seventeen-inch" concrete vault labeled 1-95 was moved to the new Waste Management Facility for ultimate disposal. Because the vault contained Pu-239 foils with a total activity in excess of the transuranic waste limits, the foils needed to be removed and repackaged for disposal. Conventional diamond wire saws could not be used because of facility constraints, so this project relied mainly on manual techniques. The planning and engineering controls put in place enabled personnel to open the vault and remove the waste while keeping dose as low as reasonably achievable.
