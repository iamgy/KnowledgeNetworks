We propose a new method to evaluate the spectra of high-energy neutrons ranging from 8 to 500 MeV. Au foils were set in a concrete shield, and the reaction rates for 13 radionuclides produced by the spallation reactions on the Au targets were measured by radiochemical techniques. The experimental results were compared with those obtained by the MARS14 Monte-Carlo code. A good agreement (between them) was found for energies beyond 100 MeV. The profile of the neutron spectrum, ranging from 8 to 500 MeV, does not depend on the thickness of the concrete shield.

The ATLAS detector is a long-term experiment which, during operation, will require to have service and access to all of its parts and components. The radioactivity induced in the forward shielding was calculated by Monte Carlo methods based on GEANT3 software tool. The results show that the equivalent dose rates on the outer surface of the forward shielding are very low (at most 0.038 mu Sv h(-1)). On the other hand, the equivalent dose rates are significantly higher on the inner surface of the forward shielding (up to 661 mu Sv h(-1)) and, especially, at the copper collimator close to the beampipe (up to 60 mSv h(-1)). The radioactivity induced in the semiconductor tracker modules was studied experimentally. The module was activated by neutrons in a training nuclear reactor and the delayed gamma ray spectra were measured. From these measurements, the equivalent dose rate on the surface of the semiconductor tracker module was estimated to be < 100 mu Sv h(-1) after 100 d of Large Hadron Collider (LHC) operation and 10 d of cooling.

Since the structure material of the tokamak is irradiated with neutrons, this environment will restrict work around and inside the tokamak from a radiation protection physics point of view after shutdown. Identification of neutron-produced radionuclides and evaluation of absorbed dose in the structure material are needed to develop a guiding principle for radiation protection. The activation level was evaluated by MCNP4C2 and an inventory code, FISPACT. The absorbed dose in the working area decreased by 4.26x10(-4) mrem h(-1) in the inner vessel 1.5 d after shutdown. Furthermore, tritium strongly contributes to the contamination in the graphite tile. The amount of tritium produced by neutrons was 3.03 x 10(6) Bq kg(-1) in the carbon graphite of a plasma-facing wall.

The resulting high-energy neutron flux impinges on a secondary target of depleted uranium to produce, through fission, beams of short-lived, neutron-rich nuclei. This paper deals with some of the preliminary shielding calculations for the bunker. Monte Carlo is employed with MCNPX and, because of the deep penetrations involved, the in-house variance reduction optimiser, the direct statistical approach. The calculations exhibited a number of typical features that are addressed and discussed.

Still the problem of low (compared to permissible) Pu activity measurement for environmental samples arises, for instance, in the case of radiation accident during transportation or storage of excess weapons-grade plutonium transferred to the civil sphere of utilisation. The base method of Pu activity measurement is alpha spectrometry by using silicon detector. A new model of alpha spectrometer, based on silicon surface-barrier detector with background level less than 1-3 pulses per day has been developed. A simple unfolding method for the determination of Pu activity of samples with various thickness based on alpha spectrum measurement has been also developed. L-X photon detection is also used for reducing the measurement threshold of Pu activity determination. A method based on detecting L-X photons of Pu, excited by X rays and beta particles, is applied for further reducing the threshold.

Radiation exposure of the medical staff is a key issue in the design of PET facilities intended to handle large numbers of persons for PET diagnosis. As a first step, the radiation dose to individuals who received radiopharmaceuticals was calculated using a mathematical phantom model and the EGS4 electromagnetic cascade Monte Carlo code and MCNP Monte Carlo code. Dose rate behind a lead shield was also calculated for various lead thicknesses. The radiation dose distribution around a syringe containing a positron emitter was calculated. The calculated dose distributions were fitted to polynomial equations. These calculations were evaluated against measurements. The second step was to evaluate medical staff dose at a specified time by superimposing dose distribution from each person who received radioisotopes taking into account radioactive decay. In this way, we developed software to support PET facility operation, namely, planning, prediction, control of medical staff dose and facility operation. This system was also designed to schedule daily radiopharmaceuticals production and to manage radioactive wastes by taking decay time into account.

We have performed a streaming analysis at the upper section of the lead-bismuth target/cooled ADS (800 MWth). MCNPX was used to calculate the radiation dose from streamed neutrons and photons through the beam duct. For the secondary photon production calculation, cross sections for several actinides were substituted with plutonium because of the lack of gamma production cross section. From the results of this analysis, the neutron dose from the beam duct is seen to be about 20 orders higher than that of the bulk shield. The magnets and shield plug are heavily irradiated by streaming neutrons according to the DCHAIN-SP analysis.

The total mass of graphite in the cores of both units at INPP is about 3600 tons. Modelling of activation processes in the reactor's structural materials is necessary for decommissioning planning, because large amounts of activated structural materials (graphite, stainless steel, concrete, etc.) should be managed as radioactive waste. Knowledge of radiological characteristics and a radioactive inventory of irradiated materials are essential in planning of the decommissioning processes. The purpose of this work was to perform conservative neutron activation analysis for decommissioning purposes of INPP. ORIGEN computer code was used for the calculations. Activity levels were calculated for different nuclides present in the graphite and estimates were made how these activity levels depend on irradiation time, neutron flux value and other parameters. Obtained results were compared with the data available from other investigations for GR-280 graphite.

Neutrons are produced by the interaction of deuterons in a deuterium target mounted on a moveable scan arm. The collimated pulsed fast neutron beam is used to determine the location and composition of objects in a cargo container. The neutrons produce secondary gamma rays that are characteristic of the object's elemental composition. The cargo inspection system building consists of an accelerator room and an inspection tunnel. The accelerator room is shielded and houses the injector, accelerator and the neutron production gas target. The inspection tunnel is partially shielded. The truck or container to be inspected will be moved through the inspection tunnel by a conveyor system. The facility and radiation source terms considered in the shielding design are described.

These ionisation chambers are used for the remote reading of ambient dose rate equivalents inside the machines during beam-off periods. This Radiation Protection Monitor for dose rates due to Induced Radioactivity ('PMI', trade name: PTW, Type 34031) is a non-confined air ionisation plastic chamber which is operated under atmospheric pressure. Besides its current field of operation it is planned to extend the use of this detector in the Large Hadron Collider to measure radiation under beam operation conditions to obtain an indication of the machine performance. Until now, studies of the PMI detector have been limited to the response to photons. In order to evaluate its response to other radiation components, this chamber type was tested at CERF, the high-energy reference field facility at CERN. Six PMI detectors were installed around a copper target being irradiated by a mixed hadron beam with a momentum of 120 GeV c(-1). Each of the chosen detector positions was defined by a different radiation field, varying in type and energy of the incident particles. For all positions, detailed measurements and FLUKA simulations of the detector response were performed. This paper presents the promising comparison between the measurements and simulations and analyses the influence of the different particle types on the resulting detector response.

This study focuses on the property of radioactive airborne chlorine (Cl-38 and Cl-39) and sulphur (S-38) produced in Ar gas by irradiation with high-energy neutrons. As a result of the irradiation of a mixture of Ar gas and dry air, Cl-38 and Cl-39 existed as non-acidic gas and S-38 was present as acidic gas. Furthermore, it has been found that in the high-energy neutron irradiation of aerosol containing Ar gas, the higher the amount of radioactive aerosols, the lower will be the amount of radioactive acidic gas.

J	Hagler, RJ; Fero, AH				Hagler, RJ; Fero, AH			ISFSI site boundary radiation dose rate analyses	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								Across the globe nuclear utilities are in the process of designing and analysing Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations (ISFSI) for the purpose of above ground spent-fuel storage primarily to mitigate the filling of spent-fuel pools. Using a conjoining of discrete ordinates transport theory (DORT) and Monte Carlo (MCNP) techniques, an ISFSI was analysed to determine neutron and photon dose rates for a generic overpack, and ISFSI pad configuration and design at distances ranging from 1 to similar to 1700 m from the ISFSI array. The calculated dose rates are used to address the requirements of 10CFR72.104, which provides limits to be enforced for the protection of the public by the NRC in regard to ISFSI facilities. For this overpack, dose rates decrease by three orders of magnitude through the first 200 m moving away from the ISFSI. In addition, the contributions from different source terms changes over distance. It can be observed that although side photons provide the majority of dose rate in this calculation, scattered photons and side neutrons take on more importance as the distance from the ISFSI is increased.

When no further use is foreseen for these sources, they become spent or disused sealed sources and are subject to a specific waste management scheme. Portugal does have a Radioactive Waste Interim Storage Facility where spent or disused sealed sources are conditioned in a cement matrix inside concrete drums and following the geometrical disposition of a grid. The gamma dose values around each grid depend on the drum's enclosed activity and radionuclides considered, as well as on the drums distribution in the various layers of the grid. This work proposes a method based on the Monte Carlo simulation using the MCNPX code to estimate the best drum arrangement through the optimisation of dose distribution in a grid. Measured dose rate values at 1 m distance from the surface of the chosen optimised grid were used to validate the corresponding computational grid model.

The INPP operates two similar units with design electrical power of 1500 MW. The units were commissioned in 1983 and 1987 respectively. From the beginning of the INPP operation all generated solid radioactive waste was collected and stored at the Soviet type solid radwaste facility located at INPP site. The INPP solid radwaste storage facility consists of four buildings, namely building No. 155, No. 155/1, No. 157 and No. 157/1. The buildings of the INPP solid radwaste storage facility are reinforced concrete structures above ground. State Nuclear Safety Inspectorate (VATESI) has specified that particular safety analysis must be performed for existing radioactive waste storage facilities of the INPP. As part of the safety analysis, shielding capabilities of the walls and roofs of these buildings were analysed. This paper presents radiation shielding analysis of the buildings No. 157 and No. 157/1 that are still in operation. The buildings No. 155 and No. 155/1 are already filled up with the waste and no additional waste loading is expected.

Only the external radiation owing to gamma rays, X-rays and annihilation photons is considered in this study. For two situations-the semi-infinite slab and the tourist geometry-the conversion coefficients from specific activity to air kerma rate at 1 m above the relevant level are calculated. In the first situation the waste material is in contact with the air but in the tourist geometry it is covered with a 1.35 m thick layer. For the calculations, the Monte Carlo radiation transport code MCNP is used. The yield and photon energy for each radionuclide are according to the database of Oak Ridge National Laboratory. For the tourist situation, the depth-dose distribution through the covering layer is calculated and extrapolated to determine the exit dose.

MYRRHA is an ADS under development at Mol in Belgium and is aiming to serve as a basis for the European experimental ADS to provide protons and neutrons for various R&D applications. It consists of a proton accelerator delivering a 350 MeV x 5 mA proton beam to a liquid Pb-Bi spallation target that in turn couples to a Pb-Bi cooled, subcritical fast core. In the first stage, the project focuses mainly on demonstration of the ADS concept, safety research on sub-critical systems and nuclear waste transmutation studies. In a later stage, the device will also be dedicated to research on structural materials, nuclear fuel, liquid metal technology and associated aspects, and on sub-critical reactor physics. Subsequently, it will be used for research on applications such as radioisotope production. A first preliminary conceptual design file of MYRRHA was completed by the end of 2001 and has been reviewed by an International Technical Guidance Committee, which concluded that there are no show stoppers in the project and even though some topics such as the safety studies and the fuel qualification need to be addressed more deeply before concluding it. In this paper, we are reporting on the state-of-the art of the MYRRHA project at the beginning of 2004 and in particular on the radiation shielding assessment and the radiation protection particular aspects through a remote handling operation approach in order to minimise the personnel exposure to radiation.

Based on simulation of several real-life problems, it is demonstrated that A(3)MCNP provides precise calculation results with a remarkably short computation time by using the proper and objective variance reduction parameters. However, since the first version of A(3)MCNP provided only a point source configuration option for large-scale shielding problems, such as spent-fuel transport casks, a large amount of memory may be necessary to store enough points to properly represent the source. Hence, we have developed an improved version of A(3)MCNP (referred to as A(3)MCNPV) which has a volumetric source configuration option. This paper describes the successful use of A(3)MCNPV for a concrete cask neutron and gamma-ray shielding problem, and a PWR dosimetry problem.

J	Broadhead, BL; Wagner, JC				Broadhead, BL; Wagner, JC			Effective biasing schemes for duct streaming problems	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								The effective use of biasing for the Monte Carlo solution of a void streaming problem is essential to obtaining a reasonable result in a reasonable amount of time. Most general purpose Monte Carlo shielding codes allow for the user to select the particular biasing techniques best oriented to the particular problem of interest. The biasing strategy for void streaming problems many times differs from that of a deep penetration problem. The key in void streaming is to bias particles into the streaming path, whereas in deep penetration problems the biasing is aimed at forcing particles through the shield. Until recently, the biasing scheme in the SCALE SAS4 shielding module was considered inadequate for void streaming problems due to the assumed one-dimensional nature of the automated bias prescription. A modified approach to the automated biasing in SAS4 has allowed for significant gains to be realised in the use of the code for void streaming problems. This paper applies the modified SAS4 procedures to a spent fuel storage cask model with vent ports. The results of the SAS4 analysis are compared with those of the ADVANTG methodology, which is an accelerated version of MCNP. Various options available for the implementation of the SAS4 methodology are reviewed and recommendations offered.

J	Kurosawa, M				Kurosawa, M			TORT/MCNP coupling method for the calculation of neutron flux around a core of BWR	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								For the analysis of BWR neutronics performance, accurate data are required for neutron flux distribution over the In-Reactor Pressure Vessel equipments taking into account the detailed geometrical arrangement. The TORT code can calculate neutron flux around a core of BWR in a three-dimensional geometry model, but has difficulties in fine geometrical modelling and lacks huge computer resource. On the other hand, the MCNP code enables the calculation of the neutron flux with a detailed geometry model, but requires very long sampling time to give enough number of particles. Therefore, a TORT/MCNP coupling method has been developed to eliminate the two problems mentioned above in each code. In this method, the TORT code calculates angular flux distribution on the core surface and the MCNP code calculates neutron spectrum at the points of interest using the flux distribution. The coupling method will be used as the DOT-DOMINO-MORSE code system. This TORT/MCNP coupling method was applied to calculate the neutron flux at points where induced radioactivity data were measured for Mn-54 and Co-60 and the radioactivity calculations based on the neutron flux obtained from the above method were compared with the measured data.			masahiko.kurosawa@toshiba.co.jp					BREISMEISTER JF, 2000, LA137097 LANL; EMETT MB, 1975, ORNL4972; EMETT MB, 1973, ORNL4853; HASEGAWA A, 2000, J NUCL SCI TECHNOL S, V1, P723; KOBAYASHI K, 2002, JAERI1344; KUROSAWA M, 2001, P 9 INT C NUCL ENG N; *MCNPDATA, CCC700MCNP4C; Nakagawa T, 1995, J NUCL SCI TECHNOL, V32, P1259, DOI 10.1080/18811248.1995.9731849; Rhoades WA, 1973, ORNLTM4280; RHODES WA, 1997, ORNLTM13221; TSUKIYA T, 2003, P 11 INT S REACT DOS	11	4	9	0	6	OXFORD UNIV PRESS	OXFORD	GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND	0144-8420			RADIAT PROT DOSIM	Radiat.

The most common way of managing these wastes consists of a temporal storage, for partial radioactivity decay, followed by management by an authorised company. The object of this work is to study the viability of treating radioactive liquid wastes coming from RIA using membrane techniques in order to reduce their volume, which would mean an improvement from the radiological point of view and a decrease in management costs. This paper describes the results of some experiments carried out with RIA real wastes, by means of processes such as ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis. It has been proved that waste volume can be significantly reduced, obtaining a treated liquid that is free of pathogens and organic matter and with an activity level around the environmental background.

The first problem is a 1 MeV point source of photons on the surface of the earth inside a 2 m tall and 1 m radius silo having black walls. The skyshine radiation downfield from the point source was estimated with and without a 30-cm-thick concrete lid on the silo. The second benchmark problem is to estimate the skyshine radiation downfield from 12 cylindrical canisters emplaced in a low-level radioactive waste trench. The canisters are filled with ion-exchange resin with a representative radionuclide loading, largely (60)Co, (134)Cs and (137)Cs. The solution methods include use of the MCNP code to solve the problem by directly employing variance reduction techniques, the single-scatter point kernel code GGG-GP, the QADMOD-GP point kernel code, the COHORT Monte Carlo code, the NAC International version of the SKYSHINE-III code, the KSU hybrid method and the associated KSU skyshine codes.

J	Scherbyna, AN; Urusov, SV				Scherbyna, AN; Urusov, SV			Concrete waterproofing in nuclear industry	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								One of the main points of aggregate safety during the transportation and storage of radioactive materials is to supply waterproofing for all constructions having direct contact with radiating substances and providing strength, seismic shielding etc. This is the problem with all waterside structures in nuclear industry and concrete installations in the treatment and storage of radioactive materials. In this connection, the problem of developing efficient techniques both for the repair of operating constructions and the waterproofing of new objects of the specified assignment is genuine. Various techniques of concrete waterproofing are widely applied in the world today. However, in conditions of radiation many of these techniques can bring not a profit but irreparable damage of durability and reliability of a concrete construction; for instance, when waterproofing materials contain organic constituents, polymers etc. Application of new technology or materials in basic construction elements requires in-depth analysis and thorough testing. The price of an error might be very large. A comparative analysis shows that one of the most promising types of waterproofing materials for radiation loaded concrete constructions is "integral capillary systems" (ICS). The tests on radiation, thermal and strength stability of ICS and ICS-treated concrete samples were initiated and fulfilled in RFNC-VNIITF. The main result is - ICS applying is increasing of waterproofing and strength properties of concrete in conditions of readiation The paper is devoted to describing the research strategy, the tests and their results and also to planning of new tests.

J	Kryuchkov, EF; Opalovsky, VA; Tikhomirov, GV				Kryuchkov, EF; Opalovsky, VA; Tikhomirov, GV			Modelling of radiation field around spent fuel container	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								Operation of nuclear reactors leads to the production of spent nuclear fuel (SNF). There are two basic strategies of SNF management: ultimate disposal of SNF in geological formations and recycle or repeated utilisation of reprocessed SNF. In both options, there is an urgent necessity to study radiation properties of SNF. Information about SNF radiation properties is required at all stages of SNF management. In order to reach more effective utilisation of nuclear materials, new fuel cycles are under development based on uranium-plutonium, uranium-thorium and some other types of nuclear fuel. These promising types of nuclear fuel are characterised by quite different radiation properties at all the stages of nuclear fuel cycle (NFC) listed above. So, comparative analysis is required for radiation properties of different nuclear fuel types at different NFC stages. The results presented here were obtained from the numerical analysis of the radiation field around transport containers of different SNF types and in SNF storage. The calculations are carried out with the application of the computer code packages SCALE-4.3 and MCNP-4C. Comparison of the dose parameters obtained for different models of the transport container with experimental data allowed us to make certain conclusions about the errors of numerical results caused by the approximate geometrical description of the transport container.

These chelators are designed to allow the binding of a tumour seeking biomolecule and/or a DNA intercalator. The cyclic amines, such as 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid, 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane-1,4,8,11-tetraacetic acid and 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclotridecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid, were radiolabelled with Sm-153 and Ho-166. The radiochemical and biological behaviour of the resulting complexes were evaluated in order to assess their potential as building blocks for the attachment of selected biomolecules, with the aim of further applying them for the development of specific therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. Novel pyrazolyldiamines, bearing a DNA intercalating anthracenyl fragment, were also explored to synthesize radioactive complexes with the fac-[Tc-99(m)(CO)(3)](+) moiety. The identity of these Tc-99(m) tricarbonyl complexes was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography comparison with rhenium congeners fully characterized. By including a DNA intercalator into the chelator framework, we expect to induce more efficient and selective damage to the DNA of cancer cells by the action of the short-range Auger electrons emitted by Tc-99(m).

J	Shedlock, D; Haghighat, A				Shedlock, D; Haghighat, A			Neutron analysis of spent fuel storage installation using parallel computing and advance discrete ordinates and Monte Carlo techniques	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								In the United States, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 mandated centralised storage of spent nuclear fuel by 1988. However, the Yucca Mountain project is currently scheduled to start accepting spent nuclear fuel in 2010. Since many nuclear power plants were only designed for similar to 10 y of spent fuel pool storage, > 35 plants have been forced into alternate means of spent fuel storage. In order to continue operation and make room in spent fuel pools, nuclear generators are turning towards independent spent fuel storage installations (ISFSIs). Typical vertical concrete ISFSIs are similar to 6.1 m high and 3.3 m in diameter. The inherently large system, and the presence of thick concrete shields result in difficulties for both Monte Carlo (MC) and discrete ordinates (S-N) calculations. MC calculations require significant variance reduction and multiple runs to obtain a detailed dose distribution. S-N models need a large number of spatial meshes to accurately model the geometry and high quadrature orders to reduce ray effects, therefore, requiring significant amounts of computer memory and time. The use of various differencing schemes is needed to account for radial heterogeneity in material cross sections and densities. Two P-3, S-12, discrete ordinate, PENTRAN (parallel environment neutral-particle TRANsport) models were analysed and different MC models compared. A multigroup MCNP model was developed for direct comparison to the S-N models. The biased A(3)MCNP (automated adjoint accelerated MCNP) and unbiased (MCNP) continuous energy MC models were developed to assess the adequacy of the CASK multigroup (22 neutron, 18 gamma) cross sections. The PENTRAN S-N results are in close agreement (5%) with the multigroup MC results; however, they differ by similar to 20-30% from the continuous-energy MC predictions. This large difference can be attributed to the expected difference between multigroup and continuous energy cross sections, and the fact that the CASK library is based on the old ENDF/B-II library. Both MC and S-N calculations were run in parallel on a BEOWULF PC-cluster (eight processors). Timing results indicate that the S-N calculation yielded a detailed dose distribution at over 318,426 points in similar to 164 h. Unbiased continuous energy MC required 214 h to calculate dose rates with a 1% relative error in only 18 regions on the surface of the cask. The biased A(3)MCNP calculations yields dose rates with similar to 0.8% relative error in only 2.5 h on one processor. This study demonstrates that a parallel code, such as the 3-D parallel S-N transport code, PENTRAN can solve a complex large problem, such as the storage cask, accurately and efficiently. Moreover, this calculation was performed on a relatively inexpensive PC-cluster. Possible inadequacies of the CASK cross section library still need to be evaluated.

J	Avramenko, M; Bolyatko, V; Kosterev, V				Avramenko, M; Bolyatko, V; Kosterev, V			Fuzzy-probabilistic model for risk assessment of radioactive material railway transportation	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								Transportation of radioactive materials is obviously accompanied by a certain risk. A model for risk assessment of emergency situations and terrorist attacks may be useful for choosing possible routes and for comparing the various defence strategies. In particular, risk assessment is crucial for safe transportation of excess weapons-grade plutonium arising from the removal of plutonium from military employment. A fuzzy-probabilistic model for risk assessment of railway transportation has been developed taking into account the different natures of risk-affecting parameters (probabilistic and not probabilistic but fuzzy). Fuzzy set theory methods as well as standard methods of probability theory have been used for quantitative risk assessment. Information-preserving transformations are applied to realise the correct aggregation of probabilistic and fuzzy parameters. Estimations have also been made of the inhalation doses resulting from possible accidents during plutonium transportation. The obtained data show the scale of possible consequences that may arise from plutonium transportation accidents.

Helium or deuterium ions from a plasma source were driven into polished tungsten powder metallurgy samples. Deuterium implantation did not damage the surface of the specimens at elevated temperatures (similar to 1200 degrees C). Helium implantation resulted in a porous surface structure above 700 degrees C. A helium fluence scan, ion energy scan, and temperature scan were all completed. With 30 keV ions, the pore formation started just below 4 X 10(16) He+/cm(2). The pore size increased and the pore density decreased with increasing fluence and temperature. The energy scan from 20 to 80 keV showed no consistent trend. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this method, thin U-sources were prepared by depositing natural uranium onto 10-cm(2) stainless steel plates. Alpha-particle tracks originated from 238U were detected in the 2 pi geometry of CR-39 detectors that had been attached to U-sources for 120-426 min. Spontaneous fission tracks, on the other hand, were detected using DAP detectors in the same geometry that had been attached to U-sources for 50-238 days. Based on precise measurements of bulk-etching and track-etching rates of the two detectors, track registration efficiencies and critical angles were determined to be 0.740 +/- 0.072 and 15.1 degrees for CR-39, and 0.995 +/- 0.035 and 0.26 degrees for DAP, respectively. Using these correction values and specific activities (or track densities) measured for each detector, a mean value of lambda(f) was calculated to be (8.51 +/- 0.18) x 10(-17) yr(-1) in proportion to the alpha emission decay constant of 1.55 +/- 1.25 x 10(-10) yr(-1).

J	Burr, TL; Charlton, WS; Nakhleh, CW				Burr, TL; Charlton, WS; Nakhleh, CW			Assessing confidence in inferring reactor type and fuel burnup: A Markov chain Monte Carlo approach	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						inverse problem; maximum likelihood; Markov chain Monte Carlo; computer modeling error; spent fuel; safeguards		A technology to verify operator declarations of reactor type and fuel burnup has been introduced. The approach uses reactor modeling (the "forward model") to predict well-chosen isotope ratios as a function of reactor type and burnup. Mass spectrometry measurements of these ratios are then used to infer reactor type and burnup, (via a maximum likelihood solution to "the inverse problem"). We extend the previous maximum likelihood solution to this inverse problem by using Markov Chain Monte Carlo to simulate observations from the posterior distribution for reactor type and burnup. This provides an alternate estimation strategy, an estimate of the confidence in the inferred reactor type and burnup, and improves prediction performance. We also investigate the impact of increased error variance as a step toward including the effect of computer-code uncertainty. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The first processor improves stationary characteristics of the count rate meter by implementing the control of the error of the mean count rate when the changes of the mean count rate are only due to its stochastic nature. The second processor is focused on dynamic characteristics. Its time response is made adaptive to the changes of the mean count rate which are due to increased or decreased radiation levels. The change of the mean count rate is sensed by a specially devised detection algorithm. Three mean count rate meters, based on the developed adaptive digital signal processors, were realized and were used for experimental validation of proposed adaptive digital signal processors. The experimental results, conducted without and with radioisotope for the specified errors of 10% and 5%, showed to agree well with theoretical predictions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Bokhari, IH; Mahmood, T				Bokhari, IH; Mahmood, T			Analysis of loss of flow accident at Pakistan research reactor-1	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							MIXED-FUEL HEU; LEU CORE	The main objective of the reactor safety is to keep the reactor core in a condition, which does not permit any release of radioactivity into the environment. In order to ensure this, the reactor must have sufficient safety margins during all possible operational conditions (normal as well as accidental). To accomplish this, a study has been carried out, for the analysis of loss of flow accident (LOFA), which is one of the probable scenarios among other possible events such as reactivity-induced-accidents, loss of coolant accident, etc. The study has been carried out for Pakistan research reactor, PARR-1, which was initially converted from HEU to LEU fuel. It is a swimming pool type reactor using MTR type fuel. Presently, a new core is proposed to be assembled containing LEU and some of the used (less burnt) HEU fuel elements. The accident is assumed when the reactor is running at a steady-state power level of 9.8 MW. Computer code PARET and standard correlations were employed to compute various parameters. Results predict nucleate boiling in the core but the temperatures would remain far below the fuel clad melting point. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Thomauske, B				Thomauske, B			Findings about final storage resulting from processing the doubts raised by the federal government. Consequences arising to the Gorleben site	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								Effective November 4, 2005, the German Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS) presented a synthesis report on "Conceptual and Safety-related Technical Questions Associated with the Final Storage of Radioactive Waste. A Comparison of Types of Host Rock. " The report is the evaluation, by BfS, of the findings resulting from work on the twelve questions expressed by the federal government in the agreement with the power utilities, which were meant to raise doubt about the suitability of the Gorleben salt dome and which could not be elucidated any further by continued exploration. On the basis of this reasoning, exploration of the Gorleben salt dome was interrupted for at least three years and not more than ten years pending clarification of the conceptual and safety-related technical questions. The BfS synthesis report marks a conclusion of work on the doubts raised which makes it appear worthwhile to draw attention to the conclusions to be drawn from the report with respect to further procedures in the final storage of radioactive waste. The findings relevant to the doubts expressed are singled out, evaluated, and the conclusions drawn by BfS are examined. The outcome is that, in principle, salt is a suitable host rock. No doubt about the suitability of the Gorleben salt dome can be derived from the reports. There are no remaining questions which could serve as a reason for continuing the moratorium.

J	Kuhn, K; Brammer, KJ				Kuhn, K; Brammer, KJ			Specific safety-related questions in final storage - A critical assessment of the BfS approach	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								The agreement initialed on June 14, 2000 by the German federal government and the electricity utilities contains a moratorium for three up to a maximum of ten years in which five conceptual and safety-related questions raised by the federal government about the suitability of the Gorleben salt dome as a repository for radioactive waste were to be clarified. The Federal Office of Radiation Protection (BfS) in September 2005 published on the Internet the final reports about the studies which had been extended to twelve questions by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment. The article deals with the approach used in processing the questions and with the contents of the findings. Conclusions are drawn with respect to responsible handling of final storage, including the demand that speedy resumption of the exploratory activities at Gorleben is both meaningful and necessary.

J	Kleemann, U				Kleemann, U			Conceptual and safety-related questions in the final storage of radioactive waste - A comparison of various types of host rock	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								The German Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS) in early November published the synthesis report (BfS 2005) about the conceptual and safety-related specific questions associated with the final storage of radioactive waste. In addition to a condensed version of twelve individual projects, the report contains a description of the results of the peer review and the workshops carried out, in particular an evaluation comparing different types of host rock in Germany. The whole project constitutes a comprehensive documentation of the current state of the art. Findings are expressed at a general level referring neither to the suitability of any specific repository site nor to that of salt as a repository formation, but covering all potential repository formations in deep geologic strata in Germany. The limits to and possibilities of, generic comparisons of various types of host rock are shown. It is seen that, in principle, none of the host rock varieties in Germany would be preferable to others. Numerous problems can be solved only for specific sites, thus requiring site comparisons. While some questions indicate a need for regulatory treatment, the need for basic research is considered to be low. The contribution presents the main findings made in each of the specific projects and the evaluations by the Office.

J	Heller, W				Heller, W			Government fund providing for nuclear waste management?	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								The debate in Europe about the accumulation, ownership, and use of financial provisions for nuclear power is going on. One of the reasons is the communication by the EU Commission about the "Use of Financial Resources for Decommissioning Nuclear Power Reactors" (COM(2004)0719). The other reason is the connection with the EU directives on speeding up the completion of the single market for electricity as one subject of competition, which was discussed in great detail in connection with the so-called Nuclear Package of the EU Commission, especially so in connection with the proposed Council directive (Euratom) about the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste (COM(2203)0032). The subject became topical again recently as a consequence of a draft report by the Committee for Industry, Research and Energy of the European Parliament. The responsible author of that report is the rapporteur, Rebecca Harms, the Media and Energy Policy Spokesperson of Alliance 90/The Greens in the EU Parliament. The statements contained in the draft report and the wider background are analyzed and discussed with respect to contents, the conclusions and recommendations cited, and the real situation, especially in Germany.									0	0	0	0	1	VERLAGSGRP HANDELSBLATT GMBH	DUSSELDORF	POSTFACH 10 11 02, D-40002 DUSSELDORF, GERMANY	1431-5254			ATW-INT J NUCL POWER	ATW-Int.

Urine samples from the workers were collected immediately before and several days after handling radioactive materials, and 5-mL portions were measured directly with a sodium iodide scintillation detector or a liquid scintillation detector. Intakes of radionuclides and effective doses were estimated from the data using the Internal Dose Easy Calculation code. Blank levels of radioactivity and detection limits for this method were determined from the radioactivity contained in urine samples collected from volunteers working outside the controlled area (control samples). Most of the radioactivity in the control samples was attributed to K-40. Under the present experimental conditions, the detection limits for the committed effective doses were 7.5 X 10(-4) mSv for I-125 and 6.9 X 10(-2) mSv for S-35 in the case of samples collected Id after handling. Accordingly, it can be determined whether workers were exposed more than the recording level (1 mSv of committed effective dose) or not. No workers in the surveyed facility were found to suffer internal exposure beyond the recording levels, and their intakes were estimated to be below the detection limits in the 2-y investigation period. In an ordinary facility of biomedical research, the amount of unsealed radioactivity handled at one time is within 10 MBq in many cases, and the air ventilation and filtering systems work adequately. Under such circumstances, the present results suggest that individual monitoring, such as urine analysis, is omissible in many cases as a routine monitoring of internal exposure for workers.

The models are intended to give averaged estimates for radionuclides in water bodies and in fish for all times after a radioactive fallout event. The models are parameterized using empirical data collected for many lakes and rivers in Belarus, Russia, Ukraine, UK, Finland, Italy, The Netherlands, and Germany. These measurements span a long time period after fallout from atmospheric nuclear weapons testing and following the Chernobyl accident. The models thus developed were tested against independent measurements from the Kiev Reservoir and Chernobyl Cooling Pond (Ukraine) and the Sozh River (Belarus) after the Chernobyl accident, from Lake Uruskul (Russia), following the Kyshtym accident in 1957, and from Haweswater Reservoir (UK), following atmospheric nuclear weapons testing. The AQUASCOPE models (implemented in EXCEL spreadsheets) and model documentation are available free of charge from the corresponding author.

The results showed that radium is found in relatively low concentration, 1.56 X 10(-2)-1.23 Bq L-1 (0.42-33 pCi L-1) for Ra-224, 2.2 X 10(-3)-0.81 Bq L-1 (0.06-22 pCi L-1) for Ra-226, and 8.5 X 10(-3)-1.31 Bq L-1 (0.23-35 pCi L-1) for Ra-228 in California groundwater. Uranium was found at the highest concentration on both mass and activity basis and was correlated with the gross alpha measurement. Short-lived radioisotopes showed no significant contribution to gross alpha measurements. There was a strong correlation between Ra-224 and Ra-228 activities, suggesting the latter to be an indicator for the occurrence of the former. Comparison of Ra-226 to U-238, Ra-224 to Ra-226, and Ra-226 to Ra-228 showed scattered data indicating no correlation between each of these isotope pairs. Approximately 4% of the wells were found to exceed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established maximum contaminant level for total radium of 0.185 Bq L-1 (5 pCi L-1). Analysis of Ra-228 by gamma-ray spectroscopy was in good agreement with the U.S. EPA-approved procedure.

Uranium is mined as a by-product of gold production. The uranium content of the surface soil and groundwater in South Africa has been measured and shows marked variation, depending on location. Herbal remedies are collected by traditional healers from many sites, some of which may be contaminated. Thirty herbal remedies were analyzed using a sensitive adsorptive stripping voltammetry method. Eight samples had levels below the limit of detection, but in five the levels were greatly elevated, showing concentrations above 40,000 ppb. The mean uranium concentration of the remainder of the specimens was of the order of 15,000 ppb. We have attempted to put these data into context by comparison with other studies of absorption of uranium by the oral route.

The image resolution in PET is known to be limited by a number of factors such as radioactive decay statistics, attenuation, scatter, or random coincidence of annihilation photons. This paper deals with the resolution limits on the side of the measured system. Our calculated distribution of annihilation momentum belongs to the intrinsic resolution factors together with the positron range in biological tissue; the other factors are due to the interactions along the photon path from the tissue to the detector. Here we demonstrate that the angular distribution of annihilation trajectories is not necessarily Gaussian, especially when the positron temporarily binds in a molecular dipole moment field before annihilation. The theoretical framework treats the electron and positron on the same footing by using the multireference single- and double-excitation configuration interaction algorithms applicable also to other bound-state systems. Our results form a subset of parameters relevant to the statistical image reconstruction algorithms, which may eventually increase the sensitivity of PET imaging in clinical setting.

J	Kossov, M				Kossov, M			Simulation of antiproton-nuclear annihilation at rest	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						annihilation; antiprotons; Geant4; simulation	SPACE EVENT GENERATOR; URANIUM; SPECTRA; EMISSION; CARBON	Simulation of antiproton-proton, pion-nuclear, and photo-nuclear reactions with CHIPS is published elsewhere and is implemented in Geant4. The CHIPS algorithm does not develop cascades in nuclear matter. A projectile creates an internuclear hadronic excitation (quasmon), which dissipates energy by quark fusion or quark exchange processes. In vacuum only quark fusion hadronization is possible. Nuclear matter is considered in CHIPS as a compound of nuclear clusters. The quark exchange between a quasmon and a nuclear cluster produces secondary nuclear fragments. The CHIPS algorithm for antiproton-nuclear at rest annihilates antiprotons on the nuclear periphery, and then some of the secondary mesons are absorbed by the nucleus. The created quasmons decay in nuclear matter. The result of the simulation is compared with experimental data. The CHIPS event generator simulates yields of charged nuclear fragments which can damage electronics and carbonize scintillator crystals, initializing plastic cancer. The high local energy deposition can make antiproton therapy more effective than photon, proton, pion, or heavy ion therapy.
