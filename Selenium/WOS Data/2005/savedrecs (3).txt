J	Rest, J				Rest, J			A model for the effect of the progression of irradiation-induced recrystallization from initiation to completion on swelling of UO2 and U-10Mo nuclear fuels	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							MICROSTRUCTURE; GROWTH	Analytical expressions are derived for the progression of recrystallization from initiation to completion, and for the swelling due to fission-gas. It is demonstrated that these phenomena can be simulated in both UO2 and in U-xMo with the same theory, albeit with various property differences. Results of the calculations are compared with available data. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Maeda, K; Katsuyama, K; Asaga, T				Maeda, K; Katsuyama, K; Asaga, T			Fission gas release in FBR MOX fuel irradiated to high burnup	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							MICROWAVE-HEATING METHOD; RIM STRUCTURE FORMATION; CO-CONVERSION; UO2; BEHAVIOR; EPMA	Fission gas release in FBR MOX fuel pins irradiated to high burnup was studied as a function of burnup. Fuel pellets of different microstructures were fabricated by three methods. The pin averaged burnup of fuel pins ranged from 5.8 to 144 MWd/kgM. The fission gas release mechanism was investigated from results of the puncture test, microstructure observations and EPMA analyses. The fission gas release increased with the increase of burnup. But it depended on the microstructure of as-fabricated fuel below a burnup of 70 MWd/kgM. The difference in fission gas release among fuel pellets of different microstructures, could be attributed to fission gas which was retained in the large size pores of the as-fabricated fuel. In the fuel pin irradiated beyond burnup of 100 MWd/kgM, the fission gas release fraction was significantly large (nearly 80%), and independent of the burnup, the kinds of pellets and LHR. This indicated that little capacity for retention of fission gas is expected in the fuel irradiated to the burnup beyond 100 MWd/kgM and this should be considered in the FBR fuel pin design.

The diffusivity of hydrogen in Li determined here were correlated to DLi-H = 1.38exp(-162[kJ/mol]/RgT). The correlation was consistent with one extrapolated from the previous Alire's correlation at higher temperature.

Three IR absorption peaks were obtained from the stretching vibrations of O-Ds in different existence states: an O-D existing as a LiOD phase at 2710 cm(-1), a surface O-D with several adjacent O-Ds at 2660 cm(-1), and an O-D affected by a defect in the bulk at 2605 cm(-1). At the outset of the irradiation, only the surface O-D appeared. As the ion fluence increased, the O-D affected by a defect started to form in the bulk, and the LiOD phase followed it. The defect related with the O-D at 2605 cm(-1) was regarded as a Li vacancy. It was indicated that the hydrogen isotopes were stabilized in Li2O through an interaction with the Li vacancy (LiO--D+: 2605 cm(-1)) or mutual aggregation (LiOD phase: 2710 cm(-1)).

J	Talamo, A; Gudowski, W				Talamo, A; Gudowski, W			Performance of the gas turbine-modular helium reactor fuelled with different types of fertile TRISO particles	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								Preliminary studies have been performed on operation of the gas turbine-modular helium reactor (GT-MHR) with a thorium based fuel. The major options for a thorium fuel are a mixture with light water reactors spent fuel, mixture with military plutonium or with with fissile isotopes of uranium. Consequently, we assumed three models of the fuel containing a mixture of thorium. with Pu-239, U-213 or U-211 in TRISO particles with a different kernel radius keeping constant the packing fraction at the level of 37.5%, which corresponds to the current compacting process limit. In order to allow thorium to act as a breeder of fissile uranium and ensure conditions for a self-sustaining fission chain, the fresh fuel must contain a certain quantity of fissile isotope at beginning of life; we refer to the initial fissile nuclide as triggering isotope. The small capture cross-section of Th-232 in the thermal neutron energy range, compared to the fission one of the common fissile isotopes (Pu-239, U-233 and U-235), requires a quantity of thorium 25-30 times greater than that one of the triggering isotope in order to equilibrate the reaction rates. At the same time, the amount of the triggering isotope must be enough to set the criticality condition of the reactor. These two conditions must be simultaneously satisfied. The necessity of a large mass of fuel forces to utilize TRISO particles with a large radius of the kernel, 300 pm. Moreover, in order to improve the neutron economics, a fuel cycle based on thorium requires a low capture to fission ratio of the triggering isotope. Amid the common fissile isotopes, U-233, U-235 and Pu-239, we have found that only the uranium nuclides have shown to have the suitable neutronic features to enable the GT-MHR to work on a fuel based on thorium.

J	Talamo, A; Gudowski, W				Talamo, A; Gudowski, W			Adapting the deep burn in-core fuel management strategy for the gas turbine - modular helium reactor to a uranium-thorium fuel	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								In 1966, Philadelphia Electric has put into operation the Peach Bottom I nuclear reactor, it was the first high temperature gas reactor (HTGR); the pioneering of the helium-cooled and graphite-moderated power reactors continued with the Fort St. Vrain and THTR reactors, which operated until 1989. The experience on HTGRs lead General Atomics to design the gas turbine - modular helium reactor (GT-MHR), which adapts the previous HTGRs to the generation IV of nuclear reactors. One of the major benefits of the GT-MHR is the ability to work on the most different types of fuels: light water reactors waste, military plutonium, MOX and thorium. In this work, we focused on the last type of fuel and we propose a mixture of 40% thorium and 60% uranium. In a uranium-thorium fuel, three fissile isotopes mainly sustain the criticality of the reactor: U-235, which represents the 20% of the fresh uranium, U-233, which is produced by the transmutation of fertile Th-212, and Pu-239, which is produced by the transmutation of fertile U-238. In order to compensate the depletion of U-235 with the breeding of U-233 and Pu-239, the quantity of fertile nuclides must be much larger than that one of 235 U because of the small capture cross-section of the fertile nuclides, in the thermal neutron energy range, compared to that one of U-235. At the same time, the amount of U-235 must be large enough to set the criticality condition of the reactor. The simultaneous satisfaction of the two above constrains induces the necessity to load the reactor with a huge mass of fuel; that is accomplished by equipping the fuel pins with the JAERI TRISO particles. We start the operation of the reactor with loading fresh fuel into all the three rings of the GT-MHR and after 810 days we initiate a refueling and shuffling schedule that, in 9 irradiation periods, approaches the equilibrium of the fuel composition. The analysis of the k(eff) and mass evolution, reaction rates, neutron flux and spectrum at the equilibrium of the fuel composition, highlights the features of a deep burn in-core fuel management strategy for a uranium-thorium fuel.

It is unique in the world since the fuel is stored in bulk containers (called storage tanks), each capable of holding more than 500,000 spheres for a period of about 80 years. The SSS has the ability to transfer the contents of one tank to another tank, and to return partially burnt fuel back to the reactor core for refuelling. The storage tanks are individually sealed carbon steel pressure vessels. They form the final barrier of any fission products that have diffused from the fuel spheres. Sub-criticality is achieved through the geometric cross-section of the tank, and by taking credit for fuel burn-up. Protection from the corrosive environment where the PBMR Demonstration plant will be built is achieved by actively cooling the tank with clean dry air. In the event of an active cooling failure, louvres open automatically and cooling is done passively via natural convection making use of the chimney-effect. Sufficient radiation protection is provided around each tank to facilitate maintenance and inspection operations where needed. The design of the SSS is nearing the end of its basic design phase, and for some components, detail design work has already commenced. The design complies with all spent fuel storage requirements and is seen as a cost-effective solution for the interim storage of PBMR spent fuel. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This so-called "endogenous production" technique rests on the exploitation of nuclear reactions for the creation of SLR directly within the plasma, rather than on irradiating an external target. Until now only one research group has published data relevant to PF endogenous production of SLR, and the data seem to confirm that the PF has the capability to breed SLR. The campaign demonstrated production of (15)O, (17)F and (13)N from the (14)N(d,n)(15)O, (12)C(d,n)(13)N and (16)O(d,n)(17)F reactions. A 7kJ, 17kV Mather-type PF was operated with natural nitrogen, oxygen, CO(2) and deuterium in the vacuum chamber. Results to date confirm that, with a PF of this type, up to 1 mu Ci of SLRs per discharge can be obtained. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This can be investigated via gamma-ray spectrometry, whereby-in the U-238 serieS-Pb-214 and Bi-214 are considered as the indicators for Ra-226-mobility, and Pb-210 as the indicator for Rn-226-emanation. In the present work, the direct measurement of Ra-226-which can give extra information on the interpretation of the radioactive equilibrium-is investigated as to its precision and accuracy. Since there is a serious spectral interference on its 186.2 keV gamma-line (by U-235 at 185.7 keV), various correction procedures were outlined and their performance was checked via the analysis of (certified) reference materials, leading to the recommendation of a "method of choice".

J	Gavron, A				Gavron, A			The role of science in treaty verification	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Applications of Nuclear Techniques	SEP 12-18, 2004	Crete, GREECE			treaty; transparency; verification; IAEA; NPT; CTBT		Technologically advanced nations are currently applying more science to treaty verification than ever before. Satellites gather a multitude of information relating to proliferation concerns using thermal imaging analysis, nuclear radiation measurements, and optical and radio frequency signals detection. Ground stations gather complementary signals such as seismic events and radioactive emissions. Export controls in many countries attempt to intercept materials and technical means that could be used for nuclear proliferation. Nevertheless, we have witnessed a plethora of nuclear proliferation episodes, that were undetected (or were belatedly detected) by these technologies-the Indian nuclear tests in 1998, the Libyan nuclear buildup, the Iranian enrichment program and the North Korea nuclear weapons program are some prime examples. In this talk, we will discuss some of the technologies used for proliferation detection. In particular, we will note some of the issues relating to nuclear materials control agreements that epitomize political difficulties as they impact the implementation of science and technology.

J	Hrnecek, E; Steier, P; Wallner, A				Hrnecek, E; Steier, P; Wallner, A			Determination of plutonium in environmental samples by AMS and alpha spectrometry	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Applications of Nuclear Techniques	SEP 12-18, 2004	Crete, GREECE				ACCELERATOR MASS-SPECTROMETRY; ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; RADIOACTIVITY; PU-244; SOIL	Environmental samples from nuclear weapons test sites at the atolls of Mururoa and Fangataufa (French Polynesia, south Pacific) have been analyzed for their content of plutonium isotopes by applying the independent techniques of decay counting (Alpha Spectrometry) and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). Here, we propose the combination of both techniques which results in a maximum of information on the isotopic signature of Pu in environmental samples. Plutonium was chemically separated from the bulk material by anion exchange. (242)Pu was used as an internal standard for both AMS and alpha spectrometry. The samples for alpha spectrometry were prepared by microprecipitation with NdF(3). After alpha spectrometry, the samples were reprocessed for AMS. Pu was co-precipitated with Fe(OH)(3) and finally, solid samples were prepared. At the VERA (Vienna Environmental Research Accelerator) facility, the various Pu isotopes were separated by their isotopic masses and quantified by the AMS technique. A good agreement of the results obtained from the AMS measurements was found with those obtained from Alpha Spectrometry. Overall, the data agree on average within 10% of each other. Isotope ratios for (238)Pu, (239)Pu and (240)Pu can be extracted from our investigations. Alpha spectrometry delivers data for the (238)Pu and the combination of ((239+240))Pu concentrations in those samples. In addition, the AMS technique provides information on the individual concentrations of (240)Pu and (219)Pu. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The appearance of terrorist organizations urged some Asian countries to make the nuclear weapons, the making the task of stopping the transportation of nuclear materials and technologies from the north (from countries possessing nuclear weapon) to the south (to Countries desiring to have weapons and its components) a reality. To resolve this problem, on the main transportation routes, "Yantar" stationary radiation monitors of Russian production were installed, and development and production of monitors of our own make was started. This paper covers these works as well as those on preventing possible terrorist attacks on nuclear objects of Uzbekistan. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

There are three distinctive developments, which are discussed in this presentation, namely, multi-stage, accelerator-based axial neutron generator, high-output co-axial neutron generator and point source neutron generator. These generators employ RF-induction discharge to produce deuterium ions. The distinctive feature of RF-discharge is its capability to generate high atomic hydrogen species, high current densities and stable and long-life operation. The axial neutron generator is designed for applications that require fast pulsing together with medium to high D-D neutron output. The co-axial neutron generator is aimed for high neutron output with cw or pulsed operation, using either the D-D or D-T fusion reaction. The point source neutron generator is a new concept, utilizing a toroidal-shaped plasma generator. The beam is extracted from multiple apertures and focus to the target tube, which is located at the middle of the generator. This will generate a point source of D-D, T-T or D-T neutrons with high output flux. The latest development together with measured data will be discussed in this article. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The noble gases are difficult to contain for the illicit tester and are therefore of particular importance to identify signals from underground or underwater nuclear tests. Several isotopes of xenon are sufficiently produced in fission and a few have suitable half-lives and radiations to be detected. These are (131m)Xe, (133m)Xe, (133)Xe and (135)Xe and they have been selected for continuous monitoring. Four different systems have been developed to sample and measure them. Three of them use cryogenic or room-temperature gas chromatography processes and one a membrane technology. One measures by gamma spectroscopy, two by beta-gamma coincidence spectroscopy and one by beta-gated gamma spectroscopy. These systems are now undergoing trials at worldwide locations in the so-called International Noble Gas Experiment (INGE). In parallel, specific analytical software is being developed to examine the spectra produced by these different systems. This paper presents results from data acquired both from regions having a high radioxenon background and from remote low background stations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

There are many companies producing radiation control systems. All such systems existing nowadays are based on the principles of intensity comparison for radiation detected by the system in the absence of control object and the intensity of the radiation when object appears. This method works well only in the conditions of constant or weakly changing background. However, at significant deviation in the value of background the number of false alarms set off by the systems increases. The present work describes the method for radioactive materials detection in the moving objects independent of the significant background deviations and present radiation monitoring establishment based on this principle.

This system consists of an electronic neutron generator, a gamma-ray detector, a data acquisition computer, and a laptop computer user-interface [Strellis et al., 2003, Proceedings of the 2003 ONDCP International Technology Symposium, San Diego, CA]. Although initially developed to detect narcotics, recent algorithm developments have shown that the system is capable of correctly classifying a threat into one of four distinct categories: narcotic, explosive, chemical weapon, or radiological dispersion device (RDD). Detection of narcotics, explosives, and chemical weapons is based on gamma-ray signatures unique to, the chemical elements. Elements are identified by their characteristic prompt gamma-rays induced by fast and thermal neutrons. Detection of RDD is accomplished by detecting gamma-rays emitted by common radioisotopes and nuclear reactor fission products. The algorithm phenomenology for classifying threats into the proper categories is presented here. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An accelerated deuteron beam excites the tritium target with normal incidence to the target plane. The transverse density of accelerated deuteron beam is assumed to be constant close to the target. Due consideration being paid to d-T collision kinetics, depending upon mass and kinetic energy of particles involved in the nuclear collision, nuclear reaction energy, etc, in particular circumstances, the elementary neutron energy emission in non-dispersive media can be considered to be omni-directional or very low anisotropical. Consequently, analytical expressions can be considerably simplified, taking into account the exothermic character of d-T fusion reaction. A number of expressions for energetic prediction of the fast neutron generated, in this case, by d-T reaction are proposed. Animated three-dimensional-graphics is suggested. Computationally tractable tools are of importance in the study of some situations such as induced reactions and activation analysis using 14 MeV neutrons, investigations in health-physics, radiation dose characterization, nuclear medicine, damage effects, and simulation studies.

The most intense growth will occur in the developing countries. Of course, fossil fuels will continue to serve as the main source of energy. but the problems due to the growth of the raw materials base will also increase. The growth of nuclear power production will fiacilitate a successful solution to these problems. Various estimates show that by mid-century nuclear power will grow by a factor of four of five from the present level. Under such conditions, the solution of certain internal problems of nuclear power; such as preventing proliferation, handling spent fuel and radioactive wastes, and developing a reliable intrinsic raw materials base based on a closed fuel cycle and innovative nuclear technologies, will be exceedingly important for large-scale nuclear power to be successful. In this article, an assessment of the possible role of nuclear power in providing for the stable advancement of human civilization on global and regional scales is made on the basis of predictions of the growth of power production.

J	Babenko, SP; Bad'in, AV				Babenko, SP; Bad'in, AV			Methods for determining the distribution function for the radius of uranyl-fluoride aerosol particles	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								A system of uranyl-fluoride aerosol particles is studied to determine the particle radius distribution function. The particles are formed during hydrolysis of uranium hexafluoride in the air in working rooms at enterprises of the atomic industry. An analytical expression is obtained for the distribution function of the radius of aerosol particles at the moment the particles are created under the conditions of one-time emission and for everyday working conditions as a function of the coordinates of the volume considered and the air-exchange ratio. It is shown that on changing to an air exchange regime the dependence of the distribution function on the partice radius changes. The distribution functions found are used to determine the median aerodynamic diameter making it possible to estimate the retention factor for aerosol particles in various parts of the respiratory tract.

The combination of the indicated materials makes thermionic fuel elements very stable with a long service life. It is shown that the use of porous uranium dioxide under temperature conditions resulting in restructuring makes it possible to decrease the size of the columnar grains and increase the creep rate of the dioxide with optimal porosity and pore size. A model oxide fuel, which has been developed, with fission-product simulators for rapid determination under extra-reactor conditions of the properties of uranium with deep burnup and for performing accelerated reactor tests is described.

J	Weber, E				Weber, E			Fuel development influenced by sustainability	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								Sustainability is an issue gaining in importance in more and more areas. The term '' sustainable development '' was defined in 1987 by the Brundtland Commission of the UN in its report '' Our common Juture '' as '' the capacity to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs ''. In concrete terms this also means, for example, minimizing the consumption of primary energy resources. This is a point that is gaining in importance against the backdrop of finite reserves and increasing prices for raw materials. The consumption of resources can be limited in different ways. In the case of the uranium fuel used in nuclear power plants this is achieved through enhanced fuel utilization, which is quantified as fuel burnup, namely is the energy derived from a specific amount of fuel. In cooperation with customers and licensing authorities Framatome ANP, in which the leading French nuclear engineering company AREVA has a 66 percent stake and Siemens 34 percent, achieves significantly extended burnups for pressurized and boiling water reactor fuel: In the course of the last 25 years the burnup of the leading reload fuel batch supplied by Framatome ANP was extended by more than 60 percent. These extended burnups were made possible by advanced fuel designs, dimensionally stable fuels and material alloys for cladding tubes and structural parts with excellent mechanical properties and high corrosion resistance. Examples include the ATRIUM (TM) design and LTP (low-temperature process) cladding material for boiling water reactors, and the M5 (TM) cladding material for pressurized water reactors.

In the present study such films were made to redeposit on stainless steel mirror substrates as thin films and without any substrate as bare flakes with high deuterium content, under deuterium-plasma discharges inside T-10 tokamak vacuum chamber. These films were subjected to spectral characterizations through Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and photoluminescence techniques. IR spectra showed the presence of two main deuterium states as observed by the CD(2,3) sp(3) stretching modes at 2100-2200 cm(-1) and the CD2 sp(3) bending modes at 600-1100 cm-1. Among these, CD(3) stretching mode at 2217 cm(-1) may serve as a control for deuterium desorption during the cleanup process of the reactor. As a comparative measure, C60 films were also studied, the luminescence excitation spectrum of which showed similarity in peak positions with tokamak bare flakes pertained to sp(2) luminescence centers. The observed spectral differences are mainly due to more localized sp(2) states for C60 and sp(3) states for tokamak flakes. EPR spectra of the bare flakes showed the defective states with a high spin density, similar to 10(19) cm(-3) which serve as luminescence quenching centers, and provide a path for hydrogen isotopes adsorption.

J	Landman, IS				Landman, IS			Simulation of multi-atomic interactions in H-O-W system with the MD code CADAC	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	23rd Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT 23)	SEP 20-24, 2004	Venice, ITALY			molecular dynamics (MD); simulation; morse potentials; multi-atomic interactions		For future tokamak reactors, chemical erosion of tungsten armour surfaces under impact of hot deuterium-tritium plasma that contains impurities, for instance oxygen, is an important issue. Oxygen can form volatile molecular complexes O(x)W(y) at the surface, and the retained H-atoms form the volatile complexes H(x)O(y), which mitigates the erosion (H states for hydrogen isotopes). The plasma impact can substantially destroy the complexes. To describe this H-O-W system, the molecular dynamics (MD) code CADAC was earlier developed using only pair-atomic interactions. Now CADAC is extended for multi-body forces to simulate molecular organization of atoms near the tungsten surface. The approach uses the Abell's model of empirical bond-order potentials in addition combined, for the first time, with a valence concept. CADAC simulates chemical features using atomic valences and the Morse potentials. The new model is introduced and model parameters are estimated. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The components making up this system are expected to be activated to a level of several hundred gyrations per hour and contaminated with hazardous and/or activated dust (beryllium, carbon, tungsten) and tritium. A suite of specialized remote handling (RH) equipment is, therefore, necessary to facilitate divertor exchange. This paper describes the ITER divertor maintenance approach together with recent European efforts towards the design and development of the associated remote handling equipment and procedures.

Consequently, the functional safety of all the subsystems of the inner deuterium/tritium fuel cycle of ITER need to be carefully analyzed and the results implemented into the design of the Tritium Plant as a whole. The basic principles for the management of functional safety are laid out in the international standard IEC 61508. The tritium bearing systems need to be particularly protected against over-pressure and over-temperature, even at levels significantly below values at which sensors or components would loose their mechanical integrity. The design shall take into account the necessity to validate and test the protection measures, noting the contamination of the equipment with tritium and the restricted access due to multiple barriers. Any protection measure has its characteristic but limited credibility. Software based safeguarding, for example, is not fully satisfactory in certain cases. In spite of the developments in software and the increasing possibilities to assure its quality, hard-wired signal processing is still considered to be necessary within the ITER Tritium Plant.

The CAPER process was developed at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK) and employs a palladium/silver permeator battery as the 1st step to separate more than 95% of the un-burnt deuterium/tritium fuel from impurities like helium, hydrocarbons and water. These so-called front-end permeators have a capacity of about 80 mol h(-1)/1 m(2) effective surface area if operated under conditions currently specified for ITER. The front-end permeators of ITER should all the time be operated such that coking of the permeation membranes by hydrocarbon cracking is avoided, since this process lead to a reduction of the effective surface area and therefore to a reduction of the performance of the component. At TLK a method to measure the actual performance of a technical permeator has been developed. This method has been successfully tested with the experimental facility for the demonstration of the CAPER process at TLK and appears feasible for the TEP system of ITER. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The final goal of WDS is to convert tritiated water to tritium-deuterium-hydrogen mixture for further enrichment of tritium by cryogenic distillation (CD), followed by recovery of high quality tritium in the gas chromatography (GC) from active gas handling system (AGHS) of JET. A tritium decontamination factor (DF) of 10(4) is required along the striping section of the LPCE column in order to discharge essentially tritium free molecular hydrogen product into the environment. A detailed analysis of the combination CECE-CD processes revealed the necessity to consider also the deuterium content in the water to be processed. Based on deuterium content measured in tritiated water collected at JET, the interface between the CECE and CD was evaluated in detail and the optimum values for deuterium and tritium composition at this interface have been established.

The correct selection of pumps is important not only to meet the requirements of the various processes in terms of pressures, flow rates, etc., but also they must be reliable and maintainable. Pumps will not be purchased for several years but they will then be required to operate over the 20 years of the operational lifetime of ITER and possibly beyond. Failures must be expected over the lifetime of the tritium plant, so attention will be paid to maintenance, noting that all components will be installed in glove boxes. A prediction of the availability of replacement pumps over this period will have to be made. An analysis of the requirements of all pumping stages within the tritium plant has been made and compared with performance of the available pump types. Factors that have been considered are whether to use single compound pumps or several individual smaller, simpler pumps at any pumping stage. This analysis is leading to the reduction of the types of pumps used. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The large and highly variable flow rate and complex chemical and isotopic composition of the tokamak exhaust stream will compromise the precision of direct flow rate measurements. Thus a complementary procedure to derive the in-vessel inventory at regular intervals is required. The method proposed consists of tracking the transfers of tritium to and from a predefined area of the plant, calculation of tritium inventory changes within that area and periodic measurement of the ex-vessel portion of the total inventory, allowing the in-vessel portion to be calculated by difference.

The tritium release curve obtained using a wet sweep gas was analyzed with several models. In the models, the effect of surface reactions were eliminated since the wet purge gas significantly enhances the isotope exchange reactions that take place on the grain surface. First, simple linear driving and diffusion models were tested. However, it was found that these models cannot well reproduce the experimental release curve. Next, trapping and detrapping reactions were incorporated to these models. Then, the improved models successfully reproduced the experimental release curve of tritium. Furthermore, another diffusion model, in which a resistance at sub-surface layer is accounted for, was tested. This model was also found to well reproduce the experimental results. However, the activation energy of diffusivity obtained in this model is considerably smaller than those obtained in other models. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The spatial distribution of C depended on the intensity and direction of the forced flow. Significant peak factors were obtained if the net flow rate was so low that re-circulation occurred; C maxima were attained near the walls for upward flow, in the core region for downward flow.

Depending on process parameters, about 0.4-1.5 kg Be powder can be produced per day. X-ray investigations, SEM and EDX confirmed among others that the impurity concentrations could be kept very close to the raw material. As grain coarsening of Be is at a given temperature besides pressure and possible grain surface layers a sensitive function of grain size, Be tablets have been subjected to isochronal annealing for 2h between 500 and 1000 degrees C in high vacuum. While annealing up to 800 degrees C did not change the average grain size of about 5 mu m on the basis of the initial datasets, grain coarsening occurs clearly during 900 degrees C annealing.

In this study, the nitrogen gettering performance of Fe-Ti alloy was investigated by measurement of the nitrogen concentration in liquid lithium, in which Fe-5 at.% Ti or Fe-10 at.% Ti getter was immersed. Moreover, the existence state of nitrogen in the getter material was verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron probe microanalyser (EPMA). From the result, the gettering effect of Fe-Ti alloy was confirmed although the effect was short-term, similar with V-Ti alloy. It was indicated that nitrogen gettering by Ti-containing alloy was prevented mainly by the localized formation of TiN in the surface region. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In particular, within the framework of the research and development activities on this blanket line, an HCLL test blanket module (TBM) has to be designed and manufactured to be implemented in ITER. At the Department of Nuclear Engineering (DIN) of the University of Palermo, a research campaign has been carried out to investigate the nuclear response of HCLL-TBM inside ITER by a numerical approach based on the Monte Carlo method. A realistic 3D heterogeneous model of HCLL-TBM has been set-up and inserted into an ITER 3D semi-heterogeneous one that simulates realistically the reactor lay-out up to the cryostat. A Gaussian-shaped neutron source has been adopted for the calculations. The main features of the HCLL-TBM nuclear response have been determined, paying particular attention to the deposited power and the tritium production rate together with the spatial distribution of their volumetric densities. The radiation damage of the structural material has also been investigated through the evaluation of displacement per atom and helium and hydrogen production rate. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The tritium activity strongly contributes to the waste classification. A better knowledge of the mechanisms involved in tritium trapping and desorption will allow to choose the most appropriate procedure to reduce the tritium constraint. his paper deals with the management of tritiated steels and the way to reduce tritium transfer. This experimental work concerns steel obtained by remelting under vacuum of tritiated austenitic stainless steel wastes. The goal of this study is to develop heat treatments in solid phase to lower the residual tritium concentration and its desorption kinetics at room temperature. The surface activity, the desorption of residual tritium at room temperature and the residual concentration have been measured for each condition (temperature, time, atmosphere, etc.). For reheating temperatures below 600 degrees C, the surface activity increases by one or two orders of magnitude; this is the consequence of the formation of a tritium rich oxide layer. After a 20 h annealing above 300 degrees C and removing of the tritium rich oxide layer, the surface activity is strongly reduced (80%) when compared with the value measured before annealing. For such annealing conditions, the amount of desorbed tritium is reduced by a factor 25 and the desorption kinetics yield a reduction factor of 40-50 after annealing at 400 degrees C for 20 h.

Design variants with breeder pebble beds parallel and perpendicular to the first wall have been investigated with the objective to assess and optimise their tritium breeding efficiency. Although both configurations are feasible, the latter design solution was shown to provide a superior performance in terms of the required blanket thickness, the beryllium inventory and the (6)Li enrichment due to a better utilisation of the space available for the breeder and the beryllium pebbles.

The EU has recognised the need for substantial progress by maintaining a long-term programme for the development of two reference designs. Recently, the EU power plant conceptual study (PPCS) triggered a design review of the helium cooled pebble bed (HCPB) blanket leading to the proposal of a novel modular design with a cellular structure of the breeding region, and substantial synergies between the two EU reference designs. The paper develops ideas of design concepts available for a DEMO reactor integration of the modular HCPB blanket. The plant layout is based on model B of the PPCS, at 3300 MW fusion power. The blanket concept proposed is radially segmented into consumable breeder region and permanent shield. Front side access for module attachment and in-bore cutting/joining of main in-vessel coolant pipes, support a quick replacement of the breeder blanket.

The BU is a stack of shallow ceramic breeders and beryllium pebble beds separated by cooling plates. The helium coolant in the dense array of channels inside the cooling plates is the key to achieve a good thermal layout of the BU, it has to secure bed temperatures high enough for a good tritium production while staying within material temperature limits. Given the complexity of the system, with non-symmetric helium headers and collectors, a multitude of parallel helium channels and spatially varying heat sources, a refined numerical model was applied to understand in detail the BU's thermal-hydraulic behaviours. The results will be used to identify testing conditions for an HCPB BU mock-up. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
