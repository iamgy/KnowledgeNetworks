In addition, tracers can be used to measure the velocity, distribution and residence time of any stream through any part of an industrial [Guidebook on Radioisotope Tracers in Industry, IAEA, Vienna, 1990] or experimental system. Perhaps the best quality of radiotracers is that they do not interfere with normal unit operations or production scheduling. In this paper are presented the RTDs obtained in a pilot plant for a hydrogenation process [IMP, Technical Report, Determinacion del tiempo de residencia promedio en el reactor de la planta piloto de hidroagotamiento de crudo, 2002]. The RTDs show a random phenomenon, which is not typical of this type of chemical processes. Several RTDs were determined in order to confirm this random behavior. The data were obtained using as a tracer a radioactive form of sodium iodide containing iodine-131 [The Condensed Chemical Dictionary, 10th Ed., Van Nostrand Reinhold, USA, 1981]. The process works with two phases in a countercurrent flow, inside a packed column. The liquid phase goes down by gravity. The gas phase goes up due to pressure difference [3 Procedes de transformation, Editions Technip, Institute Francais du Petrole, Paris, France, 1998]. The tracer was selected such that it would follow the liquid phase. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Calibrations are performed using the manganous sulfate bath technique with a relative expanded uncertainty of approximately 3.5% (2sigma). Recently, an improvement to the calibration procedure has been implemented whereby sources are regularly cross-calibrated against the national standard neutron source as well as one of three (international) standard sources formerly maintained by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. This feature helps ensure that the fidelity of NIST neutron source calibrations is maintained at the highest level. In addition to the Institute's external customers, NIST's neutron source calibration facility also provides important contributions to other neutron irradiation and calibration services provided by the Institute, as well as to NIST's intramural research programs in neutron metrology, nuclear reactor pressure-vessel dosimetry, and fundamental neutron physics.

Accurate simulation of germanium detectors to incident gamma rays relies on knowledge of the performance of the detector in different detector-source geometries. Two important performance parameters are the resolution and sensitivity. The resolution is the FWHM and FW.1M/FWHM ratio. The IEEE 325-1996 standard only specifies the FWHM measurement at one geometry and two energies. Nearly all measurements are made in a different geometry and at other energies. Other investigators [Specifications for Today's Coaxial HPGe Detectors, 2001 ANS Annual Meeting, Milwaukee, WI; Metzger, private communication, see also: Radionuclide Depth Distribution by Collimated Spectroscopy, 2002 ANS Topical Meeting, Santa Fe, NM], have shown that the sensitivity and resolution change with position of the incident gamma ray on the front of the detector. Such variability has possible implications for the accuracy of peak shape and area determination, since the calibration is potentially a function of angle of incidence. To quantify the sensitivity and resolution variation as a function of energy and point of incidence, measurements have been made on several coaxial detectors of various crystal types and sizes in different source-detector geometries. The full-energy peaks from 59 keV to 2.6 MeV were used. The detectors were placed in a low-background shield to reduce any contribution from external sources. None of the detectors tested was a low-background type. The sources used were an Am-241 source, Co-60 source and a natural thorium oxide sample. The Am-241 59 keV gamma rays were collimated by a 2 cm thick, 1 mm diameter lead collimator. Several gamma rays from the thorium source were used and collimated by a 10 cm. thick and 2 mm diameter tungsten collimator. These collimated sources were used to collect spectra for the incident beam on the front and sides of the detectors. The peak widths were calculated using the methods outlined in IEEE 325-1996. Data are presented to show that the peak shape and sensitivity change with incident beam position and full peak energy. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The detectors, which positively increase directional sensitivity to incident gamma rays, have been developed to measure directions, energies and counts of gamma rays, and to search for radioactive materials such as orphan radioisotopes or contaminations. Experimental results have shown that proposed directional detectors have a potential for practical use in real fields and will contribute to radiation protection and safety. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In the present work, an intensified EBCCD camera with 80 mm photocathode and a fiber optics plate covered by a thin Gadolinium oxysulfide layer was used as a detector to obtain a digital map of the activity distribution for a variety of beta sources. The distribution map was elaborated and displayed in a 1024 x 1024 pixel format by using digital imaging techniques. The decay constant of various radioisotopes was calculated in different regions of interest of the image, with a deviation of 5-9% (depending on the signal intensity) from theoretical values, even in single pixel areas. The EBCCD camera has shown strong detection capabilities even for single beta particle interaction and the response of the system has found to be very fast, allowing us to achieve a real time distribution map of radioisotopes. In fact, it is possible to load in RAM and display on a monitor a single distribution image map in about 1 s. Better distribution uniformity was obtained by integrating a sequence of 16, 32 or 64 images. By analysing a single beta interaction (i.e. a point spread function (PSF) on the image) the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the system has been calculated leading to a global resolution of about 80 in at 10% MTF.

To avoid parasite coincidence events mainly from channeltron anode RC circuit, we have applied appropriate Faraday screens. After getting proper counting rates, composite spectra were recorded. Based on time-of-flight and secondary electron emission coefficient arguments, particular spectra of mentioned particles were extracted.

In this case the problem of the relation between detected values and radiotracer concentration has to be solved. Analytical relation was already published for collimated scintillation detector (with several simplifying assumptions) which was used for analysis of parallel flows assuming uniform concentration in both streams. The suggested algorithms were used in parametrical analysis of residence time distribution (RTD) model by non-linear regression. For a general distribution of the tracer concentration another algorithms were suggested and tested by using MC code as well by experiments with point radioactive source. These algorithms are successfully used in verification of complex flow visualisation by computer fluid dynamic method. While the verification on the basis of measurement RTD is sufficient for simple flow structure, the verification on the basis of local responses should be used in the more complex flow structure. Application of suggested algorithms in the verification procedure is demonstrated on results of analysis of "parallel" flow realized on a test rig of the ohmic heater. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The method relies on recoil-ion separation rather than on conventional wet chemistry techniques to separate medical isotopes from their precursor sources. The isotopes Ac-225 and Bi-213 have been separated from electro-deposited sources of (ThO2)-Th-229. Separations of Ac-225 were carried out by placing nickel recoil collector foils in firm contact with the (ThO2)-Th-229 sources. One-stage recoil-ion separations of Ac-225 from Th-229 have been performed as well as two-stage separations of Bi-213 from previously recoil separated Ac-225. In addition, a direct recoil separation of Bi-213 from Th-229 has been demonstrated. The Bi-213 from the one-stage direct separation has a high isotopic purity, but contains small amounts of long-lived Ac-225 alpha activity. The two-stage separations of Bi-213 produce high isotopic purity material (>99.9999%), but result in lower isotopic yields. Range-energy calculations have been carried out to determine the yields of recoil ions as a function of alpha-particle energy and ThO2 thickness. The results of the calculations have been benchmarked with recoil separation measurements carried out using ThO2 electro-deposits over a range of thickness. A computer code based on the generalized Bateman equations has been developed to allow calculations of the amounts of any isotope in the Th-229 decay chain as a function of recoil separation exposure time and elapsed time after the separation. An excellent match has been obtained between the predictions of the Bateman calculations and the results of recoil separation measurements. The recoil separation method has proven to be a simple and effective way of separating medically useful isotopes such as Bi-213. In addition, the method has been shown to produce no chemical or radioactive wastes, in contrast to radiochemical separation methods, which generate mixed (chemical and radioactive) waste.

Solution reactors present a potential alternative to produce medical isotopes. The medical isotope production reactor concept has been proposed to produce medical isotopes with lower uranium consumption and waste than the corresponding fuel consumption and waste in heterogeneous reactors. Commercial production of medical isotopes in solution reactors requires steady-state operation at about 200 kW. At this power regime, fuel-solution temperature increase and radiolytic-gas bubble formation introduce a negative reactivity feedback that has to be mitigated. This work analyzes the reactivity effects on the operation of solution reactors for the production of medical isotopes and provides some reactor characteristics that may mitigate the negative reactivity feedback introduced by the increase in the fuel-solution temperature and the formation of radiolytic-gas bubbles.

This system can also be used with a small, portable, DT neutron generator to measure the attributes of highly enriched uranium (HEU): presence, fissile mass, enrichment, metal versus oxide; and detect the presence of high explosives (HE). For the passive system, time-dependent coincidence distributions can be used for the presence, fissile mass, metal versus oxide for Pu, 240/239 ratio, and gamma ray spectrometry can also be used for 240/239 ratio and presence, allowing presence and 240/239 ratio to be confirmed by two methods. For the active system with a DT neutron generator, all relevant attributes for both Pu and HEU can be determined from various features of the time-dependent coincidence distribution measurements. Active gamma ray spectrometry would determine the presence of HE. The various features of time-dependent coincidence distributions and gamma ray spectrometry that determine these attributes are discussed with some examples from previous determinations.

To demonstrate the feasibility of this method for PGNAA, a system of three radioisotopes (Na-24, Co-60 and Cs-134) that emit coincident gamma rays was used. Two HPGe detectors were connected to a system that allowed both singles and coincidences to be collected simultaneously. A known mixture of the three radioisotopes was used and data was deliberately collected at relatively high counting rates to determine the effect of pulse pile-up distortion. The results obtained, with the library least-squares analysis, of both the normal and coincidence counting are presented and compared to the known amounts. The coincidence results are shown to give much better accuracy. It appears that in addition to the expected advantage of reduced background, the coincidence approach is considerably more resistant to pulse pile-up distortion. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

A PGNAA prototype system capable of assaying 208-liter (55-gallon) drums has already been built and demonstrated. As part of the evaluation of this system, the thermal neutron fluence rate distribution in a drum containing a combustible waste surrogate was measured during PGNAA runs using a silicon carbide neutron detector. The fast charge-collection time of this detector type enabled the investigation of the neutron kinetics at various locations within the matrix during and between pulses of the system's 14-MeV neutron source. As expected, the response of a SiC detector equipped with a lithium-6 fluoride layer is dominated by thermal neutron-induced events between pulses. The measurement results showed that the thermal neutron fluence rate is relatively uniform over a radial depth of several centimeters in the matrix region that contributes a significant fraction of the prompt gamma radiation incident on the system's photon detector.

Reputable process knowledge may afford some insight but, absent such information, gamma spectroscopy and (non-destructive) prompt gamma activation analysis (PGAA) cover essentially all of the analytical needs, with the former addressing most radionuclides with the exception of the pure beta(-)-emitters and the latter addressing the stable chemical constituents. This paper integrates both methods into a general analytical protocol based upon radioanalytical work performed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and PGAA work performed collaboratively by the various groups. A new LBNL-developed neutron generator is also discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The availability of a complete NDA assay on site would strongly reduce the necessity for shipment and further expensive analyses of samples, improve the timeliness of measurements and reduce the cost of Safeguards sample analyses. The paper describes a modular programming approach aiming at the implementation of a software package holding all different gamma/X-ray and weighing (GXW) subprograms for analysis of special nuclear materials (liquid U, solid U, liquid Pu, solid Pu, MOX).

A fitting technique using blocks of peaks in the spectra measured with silicon detectors was developed. Samples of natural uranium from conventional mines and from the Bangombe natural nuclear reactor were analysed. The isotope composition of depleted and enriched uranium samples was also determined. The technique was applied to determining the isotope composition of plutonium samples, identifying whether the samples were reactor-grade or weapons-grade plutonium. Spectra of soil samples from Palomares and others from an inter-laboratory comparison exercise were analysed, yielding very good results. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A prototype system was installed at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC in April 1996 and has been operating successfully since then. The air is drawn through a glass-fibre filter for a period of 24 h. A cooling period eliminates products of Rn-222 in the uranium series. A germanium detector then counts the gamma-rays. Several anthropogenic nuclides such as I-123 and Tc-99m have been observed from local medical facilities. In addition many natural nuclides have been detected and the most abundant are the products of thoron viz Rn-220, which is in the thorium. series. The 239 keV gamma-ray from Pb-212 has been studied to investigate the reason for significant fluctuations in its intensity. It was found that rain, wind, low temperature and maritime air all decrease the observed activity. A model was created which mimics the variation reasonably well. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

It is essential in the method to know the exact position of the activated zone because the wearing ratio may vary up to 50% for a shift of only 2 mm. So we do need a control procedure after irradiation. Our quality control system of irradiated parts is based on autoradiography. The films are chosen according to the type of emission of the source: high resolution films as Structurix D4 are used with beta sources whereas pure gamma sources need more sensitive films as Structurix D7 with lead filters. The finite range of the rays generates blur which can be partly corrected by digitizing and deconvoluting the image using IRIS software. The exposure time is empirically determined for each radioisotope and linked to the activity, in order to optimise contrast and resolution. The position control is mainly based on a system of detailed marks and cuts made under inactinic light; we can obtain a basic precision of approximately one tenth of millimetre. Routine applications of this control methodology confirm its simplicity, precision, speed and its relative low cost. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Med. Biol. 40 (1995) 413]. However, the detection limits remain high compared to the typical values anticipated in these populations. Our approach for further enhancing the XRF renal mercury detection limit has been threefold: investigations of the ideal filtration and tube voltage with a conventional tungsten anode X-ray tube, and the replacement of the existing tungsten X-ray tube with a Fluorex tube [Phys. Med. Biol. 36 (1991) 1573]. In all cases the systems were compared by Monte Carlo simulation to that reported by Borjesson et al. [Phys. Med. Biol. 40 (1995) 413]. The optimal filtration was found to be a 0.035 cm uranium filter, positioned after the polarizer. Modest improvement was achieved by increasing the tungsten tube voltage from 160 [Phys. Med. Biol. 40 (1995) 413] to 200 kV, decreasing the system detection limit by 27% for the same subject dose. It was found that the Fluorex tube did not improve the system sensitivity for a given dose rate, either when the tube was used for direct excitation or in a polarized configuration. Despite the improved performance reported here at 200 kV, detection limits remain high compared to typical levels in occupationally exposed individuals. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The atmospheric pollution study is a principal task due to the importance of atmospheric transfer of pollutants. Geographically, Morocco is characterized by different micro-climates influencing, on one hand, the transfer range of trace elements and, on the other hand, the availability of biological organisms that can be used in trace element air pollution biodetection study. Tree-barks, lichens and mosses were used in this study to evaluate trace elements bioavailability in different regions of Morocco, Those organisms were analyzed using the multi-elemental k(0)-INAA technique. The quality control of the results was performed by the analysis of reference materials. The analysis results were interpreted in the form of enrichment factors reflecting the atmospheric availability of anthropogenic pollutant, elements such as Cl, V, Cr, Zn, As, Se and Sr. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Determination of radon fluxes from these dumpsites is problematic due to the scatter in the data in time and place and the cost involved in getting a representative sample. gamma-ray spectroscopic analysis of soil samples from a dumpsite indicates that as much as 30% of the formed radon may escape, resulting in a disturbance to the secular equilibrium of the U-238 decay series. A method is proposed to quantitatively assess the radon flux from such dumpsites by using a mobile gamma-ray detector system. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Song, MJ				Song, MJ			Radioactive waste management in Korea	NUCLEAR PLANT JOURNAL			English	Article								Nuclear Environment Technology Institute (NETEC) of Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Company, Ltd. (KHNP) is responsible for the management of radioactive waste generated from nuclear power plants and radioisotope (RI) users in Korea. KHNP/NETEC is also in charge of establishing efficient spent fuel storage for nuclear power plants. Among the research and development (R&D) activities of KHNP/NETEC to develop advanced technologies for radioactive waste management, the most elaborate work is on the development of vitrification technology for the treatment of all streams of low- and intermediate-level radioactive wastes generated from nuclear power plants. Recent tests showed that the developed technology could be successfully applied to the commercial treatment of radioactive wastes. The spent fuels are stored onsite before they are transported to the centralized interim storage facility, which is expected to be available in 2016. Since the current onsite spent fuel storage capacity has to be expanded, reracking for the existing spent fuel pools and transshipment of the spentfuels between neighboring reactors are under way. Also, a more space-effective dry storage system than the existing concrete silo is under development for the CANDU spent fuels. According to the implementation plan of the national radioactive waste management policy, a low-and intermediate-level waste repository is to open by 2008. KHNP/NETEC is currently working for the selection of appropriate candidate sites.

In the framework of the LEU-HTR experimental program at the PROTEUS critical facility, the safety-related effects of accidental moderation increase (ingress of water or other hydrogeneous compounds) in pebble-bed HTR core configurations employing low-enriched (16.7%) fuel were investigated. An important neutron balance component in this context is the integral reaction rate ratio of U-238 capture (C-8) relative to U-235 fission (F-5). It was necessary to develop new experimental techniques for the accurate measurement of C-8/F-5 in the doubly heterogeneous fuel pebbles. These have involved the utilization of specially prepared particle foils on the one hand and the counting of whole fuel pebbles on the other. Core-center measurements employing both experimental methods have been carried out in two different HTR-PROTEUS configurations (with and without accidental moderation increase simulation, respectively). In each case, satisfactory agreement was obtained between the experimental results based on the two techniques. By carrying out a comparison of particle-foil C-8/F-5 measurements in the PROTEUS reactor's thermal column with the results of standard foil-activation measurement techniques, the systematic uncertainty (1sigma) of the core-center measurements could be reduced by similar to0.6%, yielding a net experimental error of +/-1% with either of the new methods. A comparison of the experimental results with calculations based on the MICROX-2/ TWODANT codes in conjunction with JEF-1 cross sections has indicated that this calculational route overpredicts the core-center C-8/F-5 value by similar to2.5% in both the investigated configurations.

An uncertainty analysis has been performed based on sensitivity theory, which underlines the cross sections, the energy range, and the isotopes that are responsible for the most significant uncertainties. To provide guidelines on priorities for new evaluations or validation experiments, required accuracies on specific nuclear data have been derived, accounting for target accuracies on major design parameters. The required accuracies (mostly in the energy region below 20 MeV), in particular for minor actinide data, are of the same order of magnitude of the achieved accuracies on major actinides. Specific requirements also concern the improvement of minor actinide data related to decay heat and effective delayed-neutron fraction assessment.

J	Rohatgi, US; Jo, JH; Chung, BD; Takahashi, H; Downar, TJ				Rohatgi, US; Jo, JH; Chung, BD; Takahashi, H; Downar, TJ			Steam line break and station blackout transients for proliferation-resistant hexagonal tight lattice boiling water reactor	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								Safety analyses of a proliferation-resistant, economically competitive, high-conversion boiling water reactor (HCBWR) fueled with fissile plutonium and fertile thorium oxidefuel elements, and with passive safety systems, are presented here. The HCBWR developed here is characterized by a very tight lattice with a relatively small water volume fraction in the core that therefore operates with a fast reactor neutron spectrum and a considerably improved neutron economy compared to the current generation of light water reactors. The tight lattice core has a very narrow flow channel with a hydraulic diameter less than half of the regular boiling water reactor (BWR) core and, thus, presents a special challenge to core cooling because of reduced water inventory and high friction in the core. The primary safety concern when reducing the moderator-to-fuel ratio and when using a tightly packed lattice arrangement is to maintain adequate cooling of the core during both normal operation and accident scenarios. In the preliminary HCBWR design, the core is placed in a vessel with a large chimney section, and the vessel is connected to the isolation condenser system (ICS). The vessel is placed in containment with the gravity driven cooling system (GDCS) and passive containment cooling system (PCCS) in a configuration similar to General Electric's simplified BWR (SBWR). The safety systems are similar to those of the SBWR; the ICS and PCCS are scaled with power. An internal recirculation pump is placed in the downcomer to augment the buoyancy head provided by the chimney since the buoyancy provided by the chimney alone could not generate sufficient recirculation in the vessel as the tight lattice configuration results in much larger friction in the core than with the SBWR. The constitutive relationships for RELAP5 are assessed for narrow channels, and as a result the heat transfer package is modified. The modified RELAP5 is used to simulate and analyze two of the most limiting events for a tight pitch lattice core: the station blackout and the main-steam-line-break events. The results of the analyses indicate that the HCBWR system will be safely brought to the shutdown condition for these transients.

The ATR core is divided into five regions, or lobes, that normally operate at different power levels. To support future irradiation programs, it is desired that the maximum lobe power be increased 10% (from 60 to 66 MW). A modification to ATR's emergency core cooling system is proposed to ensure that adequate safety margins would be maintained during a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA). The modification being considered is the addition of an accumulator injection system. The RELAP5 thermalhydraulic code and the SINDA thermal analyzer were used to simulate the two most challenging design-basis LOCAs identified in the ATR Saftey Analysis Report. Calculations were peformed both with and without accumulator injection. The results indicate that a 10% increase in maximum lobe power is achievable. Minimum thermal margins increased more than 40% when accumulator injection was simulated.

J	Ahluwalia, RK; Hua, TQ; DeeEarl, V				Ahluwalia, RK; Hua, TQ; DeeEarl, V			Uranium transport in a high-throughput electrorefiner for EBR-II blanket fuel	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								A unique high-throughput Mk-V electrorefiner is being used in the electrometallurgical treatment of the metallic sodium-bonded blanket fuel from the Experimental Breeder Reactor II. Over many cycles, it transports uranium back and forth between the anodic fuel dissolution baskets and the cathode tubes until, because of imperfect adherence of the dendrites, it all ends up in the product collector at the bottom. The transport behavior of uranium in the high-throughput electrorefiner can be understood in terms of the sticking coefficients for uranium adherence to the cathode tubes in the forward direction and to the dissolution baskets in the reverse direction. The sticking coefficients are inferred from the experimental voltage and current traces and are correlated in terms of a single parameter representing the ratio of the cell current to the limiting current at the surface acting as the cathode. The correlations are incorporated into an engineering model that calculates the transport of uranium in the different modes of operation. The model also uses the experimentally derived electrorefiner operating maps that describe the relationship between the cell voltage and the cell current for the three principal transport modes. It is shown that the model correctly simulates the cycle-to-cycle variation of the voltage and current profiles. The model is used to conduct a parametric study of electrorefiner throughput rate as a function of the principal operating parameters. The throughput rate is found to improve with lowering of the basket rotation speed, reduction of UCl3 concentration in salt, and increasing the maximum cell current or cut-off voltage. Operating conditions are identified that can improve the throughput rate by 60 to 70% over that achieved at present.

J	Bonin, HW; Walker, MW; Bui, VT				Bonin, HW; Walker, MW; Bui, VT			Application of polymers for the long-term storage and disposal of low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								Research carried out at the Royal Military College of Canada on the effects of mixed fields of radiation on high polymer adhesives and composite materials has shown that some polymers are quite resistant to radiation and could well serve in the fabrication of radioactive-waste disposal containers. A research program was launched to investigate the possibilities of using advanced polymers and polymer-based composites for high-level radioactive waste management on one hand and for intermediate- and low-level radioactive waste disposal on the other hand. Research was thus conducted in parallel on both fronts, and the findings for the later phase are presented. Thermoplastic polymers were studied for this application because they are superior materials, having the advantage over metals of not corroding and of displaying high resistance to chemical aggression. The experimental methods used in this research focused on determining the effects of radiation on the properties of the materials considered: polypropylene, nylon 66, polycarbonate, and polyurethane, with and without glass fiber reinforcement. The method involved submitting injection-molded tensile test bars to the mixed radiation field generated by the SLOWPOKE-2 nuclear reactor at the Royal Military College of Canada to accumulate doses ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 MGy. The physical, mechanical, and chemical effects of the various radiation doses on the materials were measured from density, tensile, differential scanning calorimetry, and scanning electron microscopy tests. For each polymer, the test results evidenced predominant cross-linking of the polymeric chains severed by radiation. This was evident from observed changes in the mechanical and chemical properties of the polymers, typical of cross-linking. The mechanical changes observed included an overall increase in density, an increase in Young's modulus, a decrease in strain at break, and only minor changes in strength. The chemical changes included differences in chemical transition temperatures characteristic of radiation damage. All the changes in these properties are characteristic of the cross-linking phenomenon. For the glass-fiber-reinforced polymers, the results of the tests evidenced minor radiation degradation at the fiber/matrix interfaces. Based on these results, any of the investigated polymers could potentially be usedfor disposal containers due to their abilities to adequately resist radiation. This allowed proceeding one step further into determining a potential design framework for containers for the long-term storage and disposal of low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste.

J	Chen, GS; Sheu, RD				Chen, GS; Sheu, RD			Application of two preconditioned generalized conjugate gradient methods to three-dimensional neutron and photon transport equations	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						TORT; neutron transport; CGS; Bi-CGSTAB; preconditioner	NONSYMMETRIC LINEAR-SYSTEMS	In this paper the preconditioned generalized conjugate gradient methods are applied to solve the linear system of equations that arise in three-dimensional neutron and photon transport equations. These generalized conjugate gradient methods are the CGS (conjugate gradient square) algorithm and the Bi-CGSTAB (bi-conjugate gradient stabilized) algorithm. Several subroutines are developed from these preconditioned generalized conjugate gradient methods for use in time-independent multi-group three-dimensional neutron and photon transport equations. These subroutines are connected to the computer program TORT. The reason for choosing the preconditioned generalized conjugate gradient methods is that these methods have good residual error control procedures during computation and have good convergence rates. We test a problem having an 8 set of matrix equations with 24255 unknowns each, in a personal computer with an AMD Athlon-XP1600+ central processing unit (CPU) and using Mandrake Linux 6.3 as the operating system. The point-wise incomplete LU factorization (ILU) and modified point-wise incomplete LU factorization (MILU) are the preconditioning techniques used in the test problem. We find that the preconditioned CGS and Bi-CGSTAB methods with the preconditioner ILU are more efficient than with the preconditioner MILU in the test problem. The numerical solution of flux by the preconditioned Bi-CGSTAB and CGS methods produces the same results as those obtained by the successive over relaxation method (SOR) in the TORT program which is usually used for the calculation of radiation shielding in nuclear power plant and nuclear spent fuel storage.

To enhance energy security, the DUPIC is a response to the challenge faced by Korea's nuclear energy program. First of all, indigenous technological capabilities have played a significant role in finding an alternative technological trajectory for proliferation resistance as well as energy economics and in solving innovative and complex technological problems. While being supported by a long-lasting national commitment, the implementation of DUPIC has also depended upon the domestic techno-economic validity in association with energy security, market condition and the industrial demand of spent fuel management.

The test consists in seven-group calculations of the C5 MOX fuel assembly problem specified by Cavarec et. al. [1]. This problem, known as C5G7 MOX Benchmark, is described in the Benchmark Specification [2] and comprises two cases - two and three-dimensional geometry. There are four fuel assemblies - two with MOX fuel, the other two with UO2 fuel. Each fuel assembly is made up of a 17x17 lattice of square fuel-pin cells. Fuel pin compositions are specified in the Benchmark Specification, which also provides seven-group transport-corrected isotropic scattering cross-sections for UO2, the three MOX enrichments, the guide tubes, the fission chamber and the moderator. This paper presents the methodology employed in solving the C5G7 MOX Fuel Assembly Problem using the transport code HELIOS. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Poveschenko, TS				Poveschenko, TS			Homogenization-free reactor core analysis with general first collision probabilities method	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						fuel assembly; group cross sections; collision probabilities; geometrical module; reference solution		The C5G7 MOX Benchmark for current codes has been proposed as a basis to test the ability of current transport codes to teat reactor core problems without spatial homogenization. This is a seven-group form of the C5G7 MOX fuel assembly problem specified by Cavarec et.al. There are four fuel assemblies, two contain UO2 fuel elements and two contain MOX fuel elements. Seven group cross sections for different kinds of fuel (three enrichment of MOX and UO2), the guide tubes, the fission chambers and moderator are given. Thus this benchmark is just a mathematical test that allows testing the accuracy of the neutron transport equation solution with different methods and codes. In this paper the General First Collision Probabilities Method (GFCPM) is used to analyze the two-dimensional configuration of this benchmark. A linear flux approximation is used in the reflector. Different calculation schemes in the reflector region have been used. The output results, K-eff and the pin powers have been analyzed. The convergence of the results has been analyzed both as a function of the subdivision scheme of the reflector region and of the number of points in the calculation scheme for general first collision probabilities. Comparison has been carried out for K-eff and pin powers both with the reference results (external convergence) and with the results of different approximations of GFCPM (internal convergence).

J	Rugama, Y; Kloosterman, JL; Winkelman, A				Rugama, Y; Kloosterman, JL; Winkelman, A			Experimental results from noise measurements in a source driven subcritical fastreactor	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						ADS; MUSE; fast reactor; pulsed source; noise techniques		Both pulse counting techniques and continuous current measurements have been applied in the MASURCA subcritical fast reactor driven by the GENEPI pulsed neutron source in order to get the prompt neutron decay constant. The data from the pulse counting experiments were analysed using auto- and cross-correlation techniques, which are similar to one- and two-detector Rossi-alpha measurements, and Feynman-alpha techniques. The data from the continuous current measurements were analysed by calculating the Cross Power Spectral Density. We have found a good agreement between the values extracted from the auto- and cross-correlation techniques and from the cross-covariance and CPSD. The application of the time domain techniques becomes easier when there is no overlapping of the neutron chains originating from different source pulses. The application of the Feynman-alpha method shows some problems for pulsed systems, because of the dominance of the periodic terms in the variance-to-mean ratio, which leaves very little information to fit the prompt neutron decay constant. However, good agreement exists between our results and predictions from literature. Of the methods studied, CPSD is shown to be the best of the noise techniques to get the reactor decay time constant. It is applicable for a wide range of source frequencies and it converges rapidly comparing with subcritical systems driven by a radioactive source. In general, we conclude that the noise analysis techniques applied here are applicable to pulsed source driven systems. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

As a temporary solution, it is proposed that radioactive waste materials be stored in two interim storages. Radwaste materials that were immobilized in the inactive matrices are to be placed into,concrete containers, for further manipulation and disposal.

J	El-Genk, MS; Tournier, JM				El-Genk, MS; Tournier, JM			An analysis of Coated Particles Fuel Compact-General Purpose Heat Source (CPFC-GPHS)	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						general purpose heat source; plutonia radioisotopic fuel; coated particle fuel; space applications	RADIOISOTOPE POWER-SYSTEMS; UNITS; DESIGN	The Coated Particles Fuel Compact (CPFC) offers performance advantages for use in the Radioisotope Heater Unit (RHU) and General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) for Advanced Radioisotope Power Systems (ARPSs), generating a few milliwatts or a few hundred watts of electrical power, respectively, for future planetary exploration. It comprises (PuO2)-Pu-238 fuel kernels with 5-mum thick PyC inner coating and a strong ZrC outer coating, dispersed in a graphite matrix. The fuel kernels in the compact could be either of a single size (less than or equal to 1200 mum) or binary sizes (300 and 1200 mum) for particles' volume compaction of 62.5% and 72%, respectively. The ZrC coating serves as a pressure vessel for containing the fuel kernels and the helium gas generated by the radioactive decay of Pu-238 during storage time before launch and the mission lifetime (15-25 years). The thickness of the ZrC coating and hence, the specific thermal power of the CPFC depend on the estimated maximum fuel temperature during reentry following a launch accident, the storage time before launch and mission duration, and the helium release fraction from the fuel kernels. This paper investigates. the advantage of replacing the four iridium-clad (PuO2)-Pu-238 fuel pellets, the two floating graphite membranes, and the two graphite impact shells in current State-Of-theArt (SOA) GPHS with CPFC. The mass, thermal power, and specific thermal power of the CPFC-GPHS are calculated as functions of the helium release fraction from the fuel kernels, up to a full release, and the maximum compact temperature during reentry, from 1500 K to 2400 K. For the same mass and volume, the single-size particles CPFC-GPHS could generate 260 W at Beginning-Of-Mission (BOM), following 10 years of storage, versus 231 W for SOA GPHS. For an additional 10% higher mass, the CPFC-GPHS could generate 340 W at BOM at a specific thermal power of 214 W/kg, which are 47% and 34% higher than those of SOA GPHS, respectively.

The data were analyzed using various solid state reaction models. The integral method using the Coats-Redfern equation was applied in the dynamic data analysis. The results showed that the kinetics of isothermal decomposition of dehydrated zinc acetate was governed by a phase-boundary controlled reaction (R-2) while in non-isothermal (dynamic) decomposition the kinetic was controlled by a nucleation process. The activation energies of the main decomposition process for un-irradiated and pre-gamma-irradiated samples were calculated and the results of the isothermal and dynamic integral methods were compared and discussed. The changes in texture and crystal structure of the investigated zinc acetate by gamma-irradiation were studied using electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques.

A value alpha = 11.1 +/- 0.3 for the conversion coefficient is obtained, yielding (8.2 +/- 0.2)% gamma decay branching. The new result is in concordance with a value deduced from analysis of gamma and X-ray spectra of Xe-133m. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The radioactive spallation products in a thick Cu target were obtained for Ar(230, 400 MeV per nucleon), Si(800 MeV per nucleon), Ne(100, 230, 400 MeV per nucleon), C(100, 230, 400 MeV per nucleon), He(100, 230 MeV per nucleon), p(100, 230 MeV) ions. The gamma-ray spectra from irradiated Cu samples inserted into the composite Cu target were measured with a high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector. From the gamma-ray spectra, we obtained the spatial distribution of radioactive yields of spallation products of 40 nuclides in the Cu sample in the Cu target. From the spatial distribution of radioactive yields, we estimated the residual activity and photon dose induced in the Cu target. The residual activity and photon dose become larger with the increase in projectile energy per nucleon and the range of the projectile beam for the same projectile energy per nucleon.

These data on daily intake (through inhalation and ingestion) were used to compute Th contents in lungs and other systemic organs such as skeleton and liver using the new human respiratory tract model (HRTM) and the new biokinetic model of Th. The theoretically computed Th contents in lungs, skeleton and liver of an average Indian adult are 2.56, 4.00 and 0.17 mug, respectively which are comparable with the corresponding experimentally measured values of 4.31, 3.45 and 0.14 mug in an urban population group living in Mumbai. The measured lung contents of Th in a group of five occupational workers were used to compute their total body Th contents and the corresponding daily urinary excretions. The computed total body contents and daily urinary excretions of Th in the five subjects compared favourably with their measured values. These studies, thus, validate the new biokinetic model of Th in natural as well as in occupational exposures in Indian conditions.
