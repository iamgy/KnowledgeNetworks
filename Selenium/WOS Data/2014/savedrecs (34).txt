A typical design is a helical coil steam generator consisting of several tubes connected in parallel forming cylinders of different diameters. This type of steam generator was a significant component used at the thorium high temperature reactor. In the work presented the temperature profile is being analyzed by the nodal thermal hydraulics code TRACE for the thorium high temperature reactor steam generator. The influence of the nodalization is being investigated within the scope of this study and compared to experimental results from the past. The results of the standard TRACE code are compared to results using a modified Nusselt number for the primary side. The implemented heat transfer correlation was developed within the past German HTR program. This study shows that both TRACE versions are stable and provides a discussion of the nodalization requirements.

SET-UP AND FIRST OPERATION OF A PLASMA OVEN FOR TREATMENT OF LOW LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTES	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY & RADIATION PROTECTION			English	Article						low level waste; plasma technology; radioactive waste treatment		An experimental device for plasma treatment of low and intermediate level radioactive waste was built and tested in several design variations. The laboratory device is designed with the intention to study the general effects and difficulties in a plasma incineration set-up for the further future development of a larger scale pilot plant. The key part of the device consists of a novel microwave plasma torch driven by 200 W electric power, and operating at atmospheric pressure. It is a specific design characteristic of the torch that a high peak temperature can be reached with a low power input compared to other plasma torches. Experiments have been carried out to analyze the effect of the plasma on materials typical for operational low-level wastes. In some preliminary cold tests the behavior of stable volatile species e. g., caesium was investigated by TXRF measurements of material collected from the oven walls and the filtered off-gas. The results help in improving and scaling up the existing design and in understanding the effects for a pilot plant, especially for the off-gas collection and treatment.

COOPERATIVE EFFECT OF DISPLACEMENT DAMAGE AND INERT GAS IMPURITIES ON DEUTERIUM RETENTION IN AUSTENITIC AND FERRITIC-MARTENSITIC STEELS	PROBLEMS OF ATOMIC SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							STAINLESS-STEEL; POSITRON-ANNIHILATION; HELIUM IMPLANTATION; HYDROGEN; TI	The behaviour of hydrogen (deuterium) in austenitic 18Cr10NiTi stainless steel and ferritic/martensitic steels EP-450 and EI-852 were investigated. Energetic heavy-ion irradiation has been used for modeling defect cluster formation under displacement cascade conditions to simulate nuclear-power environments. The influence of preimplanted argon on deuterium trapping in steels was studied using methods of ion implantation, the nuclear reactions D(He-3,p)He-4, thermal desorption spectrometry and transmission electron microcopy. It was found that retention of deuterium in steels is strongly enhanced by presence of radiation damages created by argon ions irradiation. The hydrogen release temperature interval shifts on 200 K to higher temperature. For the obtaining of deuterium trapping and desorption thermodynamic parameters in steels numerical simulation on the base of the continuum rate-theory was used.	[Karpov, S. A.; Kopanets, I.

Compilation of Existing Neutron Screen Technology	SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF NUCLEAR INSTALLATIONS			English	Review							ATR	The presence of fast neutron spectra in new reactors is expected to induce a strong impact on the contained materials, including structural materials, nuclear fuels, neutron reflecting materials, and tritium breeding materials. Therefore, introduction of these reactors into operation will require extensive testing of their components, which must be performed under neutronic conditions representative of those expected to prevail inside the reactor cores when in operation. Due to limited availability of fast reactors, testing of future reactor materials will mostly take place in water cooled material test reactors (MTRs) by tailoring the neutron spectrum via neutron screens. The latter rely on the utilization of materials capable of absorbing neutrons at specific energy. A large but fragmented experience is available on that topic. In this work a comprehensive compilation of the existing neutron screen technology is attempted, focusing on neutron screens developed in order to locally enhance the fast over thermal neutron flux ratio in a reactor core.

S. Department of Energy National Nuclear Security Administration on 18 April 2011. We found strong correlations between in-situ activities of I-131, Cs-134, and Cs-137 measured in surface seawater samples and gamma-ray peak count rates determined by the aerial survey (correlation coefficients were 0.89 for I-131, 0.96 for(134)Cs, and 0.92 for(137)Cs). The offshore area of high radionuclide activity extended south and southeast from the FNPP1. The maximum activities of I-131, Cs-134, and Cs-137 were 329, 650, and 599 Bq L-1, respectively. The I-131/Cs-137 ratio in surface water of the high-activity area ranged from 0.6 to 0.7. Considering the radioactive decay of I-131 (half-life 8.02 d), we determined that the radionuclides in this area were directly released from FNPP1 to the ocean. We confirm that aerial radiological surveys can be effective for investigating the surface distribution of anthropogenic radionuclides in seawater. Our model reproduced the distribution pattern of radionuclides derived from the FNPP1, although results simulated by a regional ocean model were underestimated.

Using the FACSIMILE simulation code, water radiolysis was reproduced in order to determine the THC and clarify the mechanism at room temperature. Using the reaction set and rate constants reported by Ershov and Gordeev together with the primary yields for water decomposition products generated using 12 MeV alpha-particles, the THC was found to be 165 mu M. Further simulation results clearly showed that the value of THC is strongly dependent on the reaction set and rate constants. In addition, a possible mechanism involving a chain reaction governed by the two reactions OH + H-2 -> H + H2O and H + H2O2 -> OH + H2O was proposed. Furthermore, the same inhibition effect was found when a high-temperature simulation (300 degrees C) was performed, but the concentration range and THC were much smaller than the values obtained at room temperature. The importance of the reverse reaction OH + H-2 -> H + H2O was also investigated.

J	Choi, S; Ko, WI				Choi, Sungyeol; Ko, Won Il			Dynamic assessments on high-level waste and low- and intermediate-level waste generation from open and closed nuclear fuel cycles in Republic of Korea	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						spent fuel; HLW; LILW; radioactive waste; pyroprocessing		We estimated the generation of low- and intermediate-level waste (LILW) and high-level waste (HLW) from open and closed nuclear fuel cycles. The closed fuel cycle reflects the development and deployment of fast reactors and pyroprocessing from 2013 to 2100, while the open fuel cycle only considers pressurized water reactors. The closed fuel cycle hardly affects short-term spent fuel management but can save nearly 60% space of interim storage compared with the open fuel cycle. Compared with the open fuel cycle, the accumulated volume of HLW can be significantly reduced in the closed fuel cycle up to over 95% in 2100. For this volume reduction, high heat generating fission products should be separated from transuranic waste in pyroprocessing and stored in decay storages for a few hundred years. Mining and milling waste in the closed fuel cycle decreases by about 31%. In contrast, the closed fuel cycle generates 3.0%-4.5% more LILW than the open fuel cycle because fast reactors and pyroprocessing produce more LILW and conversion, enrichment, and fabrication produce less LILW. In the closed fuel cycle, operation and decommissioning wastes from reactor and pyroprocessing, respectively, contribute to 74% and 8% of LILW excluding mining and milling waste.

The integrated sorption and diffusion (ISD) model for compacted bentonite was developed to achieve a consistent combination of clay-water interaction, sorption, and diffusion models. The basic premise considered in the ISD model was to consistently use the same simple surface model design and parameters for describing RNs sorption/diffusion as well as clay surface and porewater chemistry. A simple 1-site non-electrostatic surface complexation model in combination with a 1-site ion exchange model was selected to keep sorption model characteristics relatively robust for compacted systems. Fundamental parameters for the proposed model were evaluated from surface titration data for purified montmorillonite. The resulting basic model was then parameterized on the basis of selected published sorption data-sets for Np(V), Am(III), and U(VI) in dispersed systems, which cover a range of key geochemical conditions such as pH, ionic strength, and carbonate concentration. The sorption trends for these RNs can be quantitatively described by the model considering a full suite of surface species including hydrolytic and carbonate species. The application of these models to the description of diffusive-sorptive transport in compacted bentonites is presented in Part 2.

The integrated sorption and diffusion (ISD) model was developed based on the consistent combination of clay-water interaction, sorption and diffusion models. The diffusion model based on the electrical double layer theory describing relative ionic concentrations and viscoelectric effects at the negatively charged clay surface was coupled with porewater chemistry and sorption models. This ISD model was successfully tested for various actinides with a complex chemistry (Np(V), Am(III), U(VI) under conditions where variably charged carbonate complexes are formed) considered in Part 1, by using published diffusion and sorption data (D-a, D-e, K-d) as a function of partial montmorillonite density. Quantitative agreements were observed by considering uncertainty in porewater chemistry and dominant aqueous species. It can therefore be concluded that the ISD model developed here is able to adequately explain the sorption and diffusion behavior of various RNs with a complex chemistry in compacted bentonites. The performed modeling indicates that uncertainties are mainly related to porewater chemistry and RN speciation and that these parameters need to be carefully evaluated.

Because burn-up of the SNF depends on the position in the SNF assembly, concentrations of uranium, plutonium, and fission products are distributed differently according to the burn-up profile. The heterogeneity of the material elements affects the selection of a representative sample for quantitative analysis. Homogenization process improvement to reduce the sampling error is thus required to precisely determine the amount of uranium, plutonium, and fission products in the SNF. In this study, fine powders (<70 mu m) extracted from one SNF rod were mixed, and the degree of homogenization was determined as a function of the mixing time indicating the relative standard deviations of the Cs-134/Cs-137, Pu, and U isotope ratio measurements.

In order to examine the dependence of vacancy concentration on morphology of helium bubbles, helium was infused into (Zr,Fe)O2-x. The oxygen vacancy concentration was controlled by addition of solute Fe3+ into ZrO2. Helium was infused by hot isostatic pressing. The helium-infused specimens were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and field emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM). In addition, X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction analysis, conversion electron yield-X-ray absorption near-edge structure and FE-SEM/EDX (energy dispersive X-ray) analyses were alsomade to interpret the results of microstructure observations. As a result of the helium infusion treatment, numerous 0.5-10 nm bubbles were observed and its number density clearly depended on oxygen vacancy concentration. On the other hand, sizes of the helium nano-bubbles in all specimens were almost constant.

First, Monte Carlo transport simulations assuming exponential distributions in the ground were performed to obtain ambient dose equivalent for mono-energetic gamma-ray sources having different relaxation depths; next, on the basis of the simulated data, conversion coefficients for radionuclides were composed considering recent nuclear decay data. The ambient dose equivalent rates were then compared to the effective dose rates for reference adults and a new-born baby as well as to air kerma rates quoted from previous studies. It was confirmed that the ambient dose equivalent sufficiently overestimates effective doses, independently of age, for sources exponentially distributed in the ground. Furthermore, the air kerma was found to also overestimate the effective doses for all ages in the same conditions. In order to verify the computed conversion coefficients, the ratio of ambient dose equivalent to air kerma obtained by simulation was compared to the ratios measured at hundreds of locations in Japan which have been contaminated with radioactive cesium after the accident at the nuclear power plant in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan, in 2011; a good agreement was observed.

Such accelerators are necessary for accelerating driven systems (ADS) and spallation neutron sources (SNS). The successful development of the conventional nuclear power plants based on reactors utilizing fissile isotope as U-235, Pu-239 completely satisfied available requirements both civil nuclear power engineering and nuclear weapon complex for a long time. But last time the safety requirements for traditional nuclear reactors based on the uranium (or uranium-plutonium) fuel are hardening, impossibility of receiving necessary amount of uranium of some countries and large amount of accumulated radioactive waste leads to R&D of fast reactors and subcritical nuclear systems. Waste processing can be also done using ADS with external source of neutrons - a proton accelerator with a beam power of 1 ... 10 MW. The parameters of an accelerator-driver obtained by numerical simulation in the updated BEAMDULAC-SCL code are presented in this report.	[Polozov, S. M.; Samoshin, A.

The result will be used as basic data for the robust design of nuclear power plant and fuels. We extended the range of mechanical strain from small or medium to large adopting the Hencky logarithmic strain measure in addition to the Green-Lagrange strain and Almansi strain measures, for the possible large strain situation in accidental environments. We found that there is a critical heat generation after LOCA without ECCS (event category 5), under which the cladding of fuel sustains the internal pressure and temperature for the time being for the rescue of the power plant. With the heat generation above the critical value caused bymalfunctioning of the control rods, the stiffness of cladding becomes zero due to the softening by high temperature. The weak position of cladding along the length continuously bulges radially to burst and to discharge radioactive substances. This kind of cases should be avoid by any means.

SINTERING OF MAGNESIUM-ALUMINIUM SPINEL - AN INERT MATRIX FOR ISOLATION OF HIGHLY ACTIVE WASTE	PROBLEMS OF ATOMIC SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							FUELS; POWDER	Sintering of magnesium-aluminium spinel specimens on air and in vacuum in the interval of temperatures 700... 1700 degrees C was investigated. The material is offered to be used as an inert matrix for insulation of radioactive waste. Nanosized powders obtained using a method of cojoint reversed precipitation from a mixture of solutions of magnesium and aluminium nitrate salts. Sintering takes place intensively in the interval temperatures 1000... 1500 degrees C and less active -at 1500... 1700 degrees C Activation energy of sintering equals (37.9 +/- 0.6) and (9.4 +/- 0.6) kJ/mol accordingly. Magnesium-aluminium spinel with relative density of 94.7% was obtained by heat treatment at temperature 1700 degrees C within 1 hour. Using the methods of X-ray phase analysis and infrared spectroscopy it is determined, that the obtained material has no other phases except for magnesium-aluminium spinel. The structure has grains 4... 8 mu m and small rounded 0.8... 1.2 mu m and major irregular 2.0... 3.5 mu m pores. Activation energy of grain growth equals (83.1 +/- 1.5) kJ/mol.	[Gabelkov, S.

J	Ghoranneviss, M; Elahi, AS				Ghoranneviss, M.; Elahi, A. Salar			Review on Recent Developments in Laser Driven Inertial Fusion	SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF NUCLEAR INSTALLATIONS			English	Review							PLASMA INTERACTION; PULSES; IGNITION; ACCELERATION; COMPRESSION; GENERATION; SYSTEM; FORCES; BEAMS	Discovery of the laser in 1960 hopes were based on using its very high energy concentration within very short pulses of time and very small volumes for energy generation from nuclear fusion as "Inertial Fusion Energy" (IFE), parallel to the efforts to produce energy from "Magnetic Confinement Fusion" (MCF), by burning deuterium-tritium (DT) in high temperature plasmas to helium. Over the years the fusion gain was increased by a number of magnitudes and has reached nearly break-even after numerous difficulties in physics and technology had been solved. After briefly summarizing laser driven IFE, we report how the recently developed lasers with pulses of petawatt power and picosecond duration may open new alternatives for IFE with the goal to possibly ignite solid or low compressed DT fuel thereby creating a simplified reactor scheme. Ultrahigh acceleration of plasma blocks after irradiation of picosecond (PS) laser pulses of around terawatt (TW) power in the range of 10(20) cm/s(2) was discovered by Sauerbrey (1996) as measured by Doppler effect where the laser intensity was up to about 10(18) W/cm(2). This is several orders of magnitude higher than acceleration by irradiation based on thermal interaction of lasers has produced.	[Ghoranneviss, M.; Elahi, A.

The fiber-optic sensor consists of a light-generating probe, such as scintillators for radiation detection, plastic optical fibers, and light-measuring devices, such as PMT. The (Lu,Y)(2)SiO5:Ce(LYSO:Ce) scintillator was chosen as the light-generating probe. The (Lu,Y)(2)SiO5:Ce(LYSO:Ce) scintillator has higher scintillation efficiency than the others and transmits light well through an optical fiber because its refraction index is similar to the refractive index of the optical fiber. The fiber-optic radiation sensor using the (Lu,Y)(2)SiO5:Ce(LYSO:Ce) scintillator was evaluated in terms of the detection efficiency and reproducibility for examining its applicability as a radiation sensor.

Natural Radioactivity Measurements and Radiation Dose Estimation in Some Sedimentary Rock Samples in Turkey	SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF NUCLEAR INSTALLATIONS			English	Article							BUILDING-MATERIALS	The natural radioactivity existed since creation of the universe due to the long life time of some radionuclides. This natural radioactivity is caused by gamma-radiation originating fromthe uraniumand thoriumseries and K-40. In this study, the gamma radiation has been measured to determine natural radioactivity of U-238, Th-232, and K-40 in collected sedimentary rock samples in different places of Turkey. The measurements have been performed using gamma-ray spectrometer containing NaI(Tl) detector and multichannel analyser (MCA). Absorbed dose rate (D), annual effective dose (AED), radium equivalent activities (Ra-eq), external hazard index (H-ex), and internal hazard index (H-in) associated with the natural radionuclide were calculated to assess the radiation hazard of the natural radioactivity in the sedimentary rock samples. The average values of absorbed dose rate in air (D), annual effective dose (AED), radium equivalent activity (Raeq), external hazard index (H-ex), and internal hazard index (H-in) were calculated and these were 45.425 nGy/h, 0.056mSv/y, 99.014 Bq/kg, 0.267, and 0.361, respectively.

Contamination of Japanese foodstuffs of terrestrial origin after the Fukushima nuclear accident and related dose assessment	RADIOPROTECTION			English	Article						Fukushima NPP accident; foodstuff contamination; ingestion; dose assessment	POWER-PLANT	This article proposes an assessment of the ingestion doses potentially received by people living in the Japanese areas most severely affected by the radioactive deposits due to the Fukushima nuclear accident. The assessment distinguishes two consecutive periods: the first 2 months (March 15th to May 15th 2011) and the rest of the year 2011, according to the two main foodstuff contamination periods identified (Renaud et al., 2013). On the basis of the worst-case hypothesis that can reasonably be made, the estimated doses are much lower than they might have been in other circumstances, on account of generally moderate levels of contamination for most foods, early evacuation of the most severely affected areas and the consumption bans ordered by the Japanese authorities. Thus, a single ingestion of 100 g of leafy vegetables in the early days by a one-year-old child living in non-evacuated localities near Iitate and Kawamata could have led to an equivalent dose to the thyroid of about 25 mSv; and to a thyroid dose of about 140 mSv for the rather unrealistic scenario of a daily consumption. Because of the rapid decrease in the contamination of vegetables and a much weaker contamination of other crops, and thanks to measures taken by the authorities (prohibition of consumption, use of certain fodder, etc.), the ingestion doses potentially received during the remainder of the year 2011 are estimated to be below 1 mSv. In the event that sales limits would have been ignored, only repeated consumption of mushrooms would have led to doses above that level. Even with the worst-case hypotheses, the doses potentially caused by ingestion are much lower than those resulting from outdoor exposure to radioactive deposits: approximately several millisieverts in a year for the population living in the non-evacuated localities near Mate and Kawamata.

Transfer factors of Ra-226, Pb-210 and Po-210 from NORM-contaminated oilfield soil to some Atriplex species, Alfalfa and Bermuda grass	RADIOPROTECTION			English	Article						transfer factor; Radium-266; Lead-210; Polonium-210; Atriplex, Alfalfa, Bermuda grasses; contaminated soil; NORM; Syrian oilfield	PLANT TRANSFER-FACTORS; MEDITERRANEAN AREA; URANIUM; U-238; TH	Transfer factors of Ra-226, Pb-210 an Po-210 from soil contaminated with naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) in oilfields to some grazing plants were determined using pot experiments. Contaminated soil was collected from a dry surface evaporation pit from a Syrian oilfield in the Der Ezzor area. Five types of plants (Atriplex halimus L., Atriplex canescens, Atriplex Leucoclada Bioss, Alfalfa and Bermuda grass) were grown and harvested three times over two years. The results show that the mean transfer factors of Ra-226 from the contaminated soil to the studied plant species were 1.6 x 10(-3) for Atriplex halimus L., 2.1 x 10(-3) for Atriplex canescens, 2.5 x 10(-3) for Atriplex Leucoclada Bioss, 8.2 x 10(-3) for Bermuda grass, and the highest value was 1.7 x 10(-2) for Alfalfa. Transfer factors of (210)pb and Po-210 were higher than Ra-226 TFs by one order of magnitude and reached 7 x 10(-3), 1.1 x 10(-2), 1.2 x 10(-2), 3.2 x 10(-2) and 2.5 x 10(-2) for Atriplex halimus, Atriplex canescens, Atriplex Leucoclada Bioss, Bermuda grass and Alfalfa, respectively. The results can be considered as base values for transfer factors of Ra-226, Pb-210 and Po-210 in semiarid regions.	[Al-Masri, M.

RADIOPROTECTION			French	Review						event; feedback; medical; radioprotection; risk management; audit		The ASN launched in July 2007 a system of notification of significant events dealing with ionising radiation, called ESRs. The ESRs notified to the ASN in the medical field have been increasing since 2007 and amounted to a total of 2300. The information showed that the medical activities with the most important implications for radiation protection regarding professionals are interventional radiology, with dose limit overruns, brachytherapy and nuclear medicine, with internal contamination of operators. For patients, deterministic effects were observed in interventional radiology as well as large doses in nuclear medicine, when the process of issuing radiopharmaceuticals is not managed, with the worst ESR being a partial removal of the thyroid. Many events involve leaks of radioactive waste and emphasise the need to strengthen the maintenance and monitoring facilities, and can cause major disruptions of service with delays in the delivery of care. The feedback emphasises the importance of empowering medical physicists and radiation protection officers to implement steps of quality management and risk management as well as clinical audits.

Compared with traditional uranium-plutonium mixed oxide (U-MOX) fuels, Th-MOX fuel has higher consumption rate of plutonium in LWRs. Besides, thorium based fuels have improved thermomechanical material properties compared with traditional U-MOX fuels. Previous studies on a full Th-MOX core have shown reduced efficiency in reactivity control mechanisms, stronger reactivity feedback, and a significantly lower fraction of delayed neutrons compared with a traditional uranium oxide (UOX) core. These problems complicate the implementation of a full Th-MOX core in a similar way as for a traditional U-MOX core. In order to reduce and avoid some of these issues, the introduction of a lower fraction of Th-MOX fuel in the core is proposed. In this study, one-third of the assemblies are Th-MOX fuel, and the rest are traditional UOX fuel. The feasibility study is based on the Swedish Ringhals-3 PWR. The results show that the core characteristics are more similar to a traditional UOX core, and the fraction of delayed neutrons is within acceptable limits. Moreover, the damping of axial xenon oscillations induced by control rod insertions is almost 5 times more effective for the 1/3 Th-MOX core compared with the standard core.

The innovative assemblies were loaded with high enrichment UO2 and MOX fuels. Additionally the impact of the moderation enhancement on the void reactivity coefficient through a full fuel burnup discharge interval was investigated for the innovative assembly with MOX fuel. For the numerical analysis the TRITON functional module of SCALE code with ENDF/B-VI cross section library was applied. The obtained results indicate the influence of the most important isotopes to the void reactivity behaviour over a fuel burnup interval of 70GWd/t for both UO2 and MOX fuels. From the neutronic safety concern positive void reactivity coefficient values are observed for MOX fuel at the beginning of the fuel irradiation cycle. For extra-moderated assembly designs, implementing 8 and 12 water holes, the neutron spectrum softening is achieved and consequently the lower void reactivity values. Variations in void reactivity coefficient values are explained by fulfilled decomposition analysis based on neutrons absorption reactions for separate isotopes.

J	Zhang, P; Wang, K; Yu, GL				Zhang, Peng; Wang, Kan; Yu, Ganglin			A Simplified Supercritical Fast Reactor with Thorium Fuel	SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF NUCLEAR INSTALLATIONS			English	Article							VOID REACTIVITY; BREEDER REACTOR; WATER; CORE; DESIGN; CYCLE	Super-Critical water-cooled Fast Reactor (SCFR) is a feasible option for the Gen-IV SCWR designs, in which much less moderator and thus coolant are needed for transferring the fission heat from the core compared with the traditional LWRs. The fast spectrum of SCFR is useful for fuel breeding and thorium utilization, which is then beneficial for enhancing the sustainability of the nuclear fuel cycle. A SCFR core is constructed in this work, with the aim of simplifying the mechanical structure and keeping negative coolant void reactivity during the whole core life. A core burnup simulation scheme based on Monte Carlo lattice homogenization is adopted in this study, and the reactor physics analysis has been performed with DU-MOX and Th-MOX fuel. The main issues discussed include the fuel conversion ratio and the coolant void reactivity. The analysis shows that thorium-based fuel can provide inherent safety for SCFR without use of blanket, which is favorable for the mechanical design of SCFR.

J	Fradera, J; Cuesta-Lopez, S				Fradera, J.; Cuesta-Lopez, S.			Impact of nuclear irradiation on helium bubble nucleation at interfaces in liquid metals coupled to permeation through stainless steels	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							MOLTEN LITHIUM-LEAD; TRITIUM PERMEATION; HOMOGENEOUS NUCLEATION; SUPERSATURATED VAPOR; NEUTRON-IRRADIATION; HYDROGEN PERMEATION; BARRIER DEVELOPMENT; SURFACE-REACTION; PB-17LI; BLANKET	The impact of nucleating gas bubbles in the form of a dispersed gas phase on hydrogen isotope permeation at interfaces between liquid metals, like LLE, and structural materials, like stainless steel, has been studied. Liquid metal to structural material interfaces involving surfaces, may lower the nucleation barrier promoting bubble nucleation at active sites. Hence, hydrogen isotope absorption into gas bubbles modelling and control at interfaces may have a capital importance regarding design, operation and safety. He bubbles as a permeation barrier principle is analysed showing a significant impact on hydrogen isotope permeation, which may have a significant effect on liquid metal systems, e.g., tritium extraction systems. Liquid metals like LLE under nuclear irradiation in, e.g., breeding blankets of a nuclear fusion reactor would generate tritium which is to be extracted and recirculated as fuel. At the same time that tritium is bred, helium is also generated and may precipitate in the form of nano bubbles. Phenomena modelling is exposed and implemented in openFROM (R) CFD tool for OD to 3D simulations. Results for a 1D case show the impact of a He dispersed phase of nano bubbles on hydrogen isotopes permeation at an interface. In addition, a simple permeator simulation, consisting in a straight 3D pipe is exposed showing the effect of a He dispersed gas phase on hydrogen isotope permeation through different stainless steels. Results show the permeation reduction as a function of the interface area covered by He bubbles. Our work highlights the effect of gas bubble nucleation at interfaces and the importance of controlling these phenomena in nuclear technology applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, the Cr2O3 film was prepared by MOCVD on 316L stainless steel using chromium(III) acetylacetonate as precursor. The film was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The hydrogen permeation inhibition performance of films was investigated by deuterium permeation experiment. The 366 nm thick Cr2O3 film on 316L could reduce the deuterium permeability by 24-117 times at 823-973 K, revealing efficient inhibition to hydrogen permeation. The Cr2O3 film is dense, crack-free and has a corundum structure which possesses a more stable structure than a metastable phase or an amorphous phase. Moreover, the crystalline Cr2O3 could be easily obtained by MOCVD at a low temperature, e.g. 773 K. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Code assessment and modelling for Design Basis Accident Analysis of the European sodium fast reactor design. Part I: System description, modelling and benchmarking	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							FUEL; BEHAVIOR	The new reactor concepts proposed in the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) are conceived to improve the use of natural resources, reduce the amount of high-level radioactive waste and excel in their reliability and safe operation. Among these novel designs sodium fast reactors (SFRs) stand out due to their technological feasibility as demonstrated in several countries during the last decades. As part of the contribution of EURATOM to GIF the CP-ESFR is a collaborative project with the objective, among others, to perform extensive analysis on safety issues involving renewed SFR demonstrator designs. The verification of computational tools able to simulate the plant behaviour under postulated accidental conditions by code-to-code comparison was identified as a key point to ensure reactor safety. In this line, several organizations employed coupled neutronic and thermal-hydraulic system codes able to simulate complex and specific phenomena involving multi-physics studies adapted to this particular fast reactor technology. In the "Introduction" of this paper the framework of this study is discussed, the second section describes the envisaged plant design and the commonly agreed upon modelling guidelines. The third section presents a comparative analysis of the calculations performed by each organisation applying their models and codes to a common agreed transient with the objective to harmonize the models as well as validating the implementation of all relevant physical phenomena in the different system codes.

Finite element analyses of stresses and deformations occurring inside the cylindrical canister under the deposited conditions are performed to assess its structural strength at various rotation angles (phi) of the SNF basket. Specifically, the cross sections of four square tube shaped SNF baskets (assemblies) contained in the canister are rotated. Using a conventional structural analysis and a Kriging method, an optimal rotation angle is determined in relation to canister diameter and weight. Both sets of results are in agreement. It was also determined that the computed deformation changes slightly in relation to variances in rotation angle, while the stress incurred inside the cast iron insert of the canister noticeably changes reaching its highest value at phi = 45 degrees while still maintaining safe structural integrity. It is concluded that the diameter of the canister can be reduced from its original design value (102 cm) to 95.8463 cm resulting in a similar to 16.0% reduction in canister weight for an optimal rotation angle of 45 degrees.

Garnet nuclear waste forms - Solubility at repository conditions	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							IRRADIATION; CM-244; DECAY	Radioactive rare-earth elements (REEs) constitute a significant waste stream produced from modified open and full nuclear fuel cycles. Immobilization of these REE radionuclides is thus important for sustainable nuclear energy growth. In this work, we investigated the suitability of garnets as potential waste forms for REEs by measuring their aqueous stability at repository conditions. Three garnet samples, including one natural grossular (Ca3Al2Si3O12) and two synthetic phases (LuAG - Lu3Al5O12 and YAG - Y3Al5O12), were studied. Single-crystal X-ray structural refinements show that the unit-cell volumes increase from 1657.19 angstrom(3) for grossular to 1679.8 angstrom(3) for LuAG and to 1721.7 angstrom(3) for YAG. This trend is due to increases in ionic radii in both the 8-coordinated X (from Ca to Lu to Y) and 4-coordinated Z (from Si to Al) cations. Hydrothermal experiments of the three samples were performed at 200 degrees C and 150 bar for 4 weeks using water and brine solutions to evaluate their solubility. The natural grossular sample exhibited Al leach rates ranging from 2.5 x 10(-4) to 6.43 x 10(-5) g/L.day and Ca leach rates from 1.39 x 10(-3) to 4.57 x 10(-3) g/L.day, indicating incongruent nature of the cation dissolution. The LuAG sample exhibited Lu leach rates of 3.73 x 10(-4) to 2.19 x 10(-4) g/L.day, and the YAG sample had Y leach rates of 1.29 x 10(-4) to 5.64 x 10(-5) g/L.day. Although these samples are generally more soluble in brine (which is more representative of repository conditions) than in water, as evidenced by both water chemistry and microstructural features, all the dissolution rates are relatively small. Thus, the high aqueous stability, together with the flexibility of the garnet structure to incorporate large cations, demonstrate that garnets are potentially robust waste forms for storing radioactive REEs.

J	Kwag, S; Lee, JM; Oh, J; Ryu, JS				Kwag, Shinyoung; Lee, Jong-Min; Oh, Jinho; Ryu, Jeong-Soo			Development of system design and seismic performance evaluation for reactor pool working platform of a research reactor	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							FRAGILITIES; MASS; RISK	The reactor pool working platform (RPWP) has been newly designed for an open-tank-in-pool type research reactor, and its seismic response, structural integrity, serviceability, and seismic margin have been evaluated during and after seismic events in this paper. The main important concept of the RPWP is to minimize the pool top radiation level by physically covering the reactor pool of the open-tank-in-pool type research reactor and suppressing the rise of flow induced by the primary cooling system. It is also to provide easy handling of the irradiated objects under the pool water by providing guide tubes and refueling cover to make the radioisotopes irradiated and protect the reactor structure assembly. For this concept, the new three dimensional design model of the RPWP is established for manufacturing, installation and operation, and the analytical model is developed to analyze the seismic performance. Since it is submerged under and influenced by water, the hydrodynamic effect is taken into account by using the hydrodynamic added mass method. To investigate the dynamic characteristics of the RPWP, a modal analysis of the developed analytical model is performed. To evaluate the structural integrity and serviceability of the RPWP, the response spectrum analysis and response time history analysis have been performed under the static load and the seismic load of a safe shutdown earthquake (SSE). Their stresses are analyzed for the structural integrity. The possibility of an impact between the RPWP and the most adjacent structure is investigated for the serviceability. The analysis results show that the maximum stress values of the base frame, guide tubes and refueling cover of the RPWP under the seismic event are within the specified code limits. It is confirmed that an impact does not take place under a seismic event. Also, the seismic margin of the RPWP is studied, and the seismic limit to sustain the structural integrity and serviceability is attained based on the deterministic and probability methods. Lastly, the hydrodynamic effect on the seismic performance of the RPWP is quantitatively investigated and from the result, an objective basis of the consideration of the hydrodynamic influence is acquired. Therefore, it is concluded that the newly devised RPWP is safely designed in that no damage to the structural integrity and serviceability, and a sufficient seismic margin is expected.

An optimized fuel handling route will also limit its investment cost. In that field, CEA has engaged some innovation study either of complete FHR or on the optimization of some specific components. This paper presents the study of three SFR fuel handling route fully described and compared to a reference FHR option. In those three FHR, two use a gas corridor to transfer spent and fresh fuel assembly and the third uses two casks with a sodium pot to evacuate and load an assembly in parallel. All of them are designed for the ASTRID reactor (1500 MWth) but can be extrapolated to power reactors and are compatible with the mutualisation of one FHS coupled with two reactors. These three concepts are then intercompared and evaluated with the reference FHR according to four criteria: performances, risk assessment, investment cost, and qualification time. This analysis reveals that the "mixed way" FHR presents interesting solutions mainly in terms of design simplicity and time reduction. Therefore its study will be pursued for ASTRID as an alternative option.

In the process, the radioactivity concentrations of the pool water and sediment substances (residue) were measured to estimate the deposition density of the fallout. At a pool situated 50 km away from the NPP, the average concentrations of radiocesium (Cs134+137) for the water and residue were quantified as 170 Bq L-1 and 3.6 x 10(5) Bq kg(-1), respectively. Taking account of the radioactivity concentrations and of the water balance in and around the pool, the deposition density of radiocesium, as of August 2011, was precisely determined to be 0.32 +/- 0.03 MBq m(-2) (k = 1). The density corroborated the previous results obtained by other methods, i.e., airborne surveys, in-situ Ge surveys and soil samplings at neighboring locations. Other than radiocesium, the only gamma-emitting nuclide detected was Ag-110m, with a concentration of 560 Bq kg(-1) in the residue. The radioactivity concentrations of Sr-89, Sr-90, Pu-238 and Pu239+240 in the water were all less than the minimum detectable activities -2, 0.1, 0.002 and 0.002 Bq L-1, respectively.

The contents of these waters are important to understand positive/negative effects on human life. In this study, natural radioactivity concentrations of geothermal waters were investigated to evaluate the effect on soils and agricultural activities. Geothermal water samples were collected from the Seferihisar Geothermal Region, and the radon and radium concentrations of these waters were analysed using a collector chamber method. Also soil samples, which are irrigated with geothermal waters, were collected from the surroundings of geothermal areas, and natural radioactivity concentrations of collected samples (U, Th and K) were determined using an NaI(Tl) detector system. The activity concentrations of radon and radium were found to be 0.6-6.0 and 0.1-1.0 Bq l(-1), respectively. Generally, the obtained results are not higher compared with the geothermal waters of the world. The activity concentrations in soils were found to be in the range of 3.3-120.3 Bq kg(-1) for Ra-226 (eU), 0.3-108.5 Bq kg(-1) for Th-232 (eTh), 116.0-850.0 Bq kg(-1) for K-40 (% K).

In heavy mineral sands, U-238 and Th-232 concentrations were 70 +/- 2 and 308 +/- 9 Bq kg(-1) dry weight (dw), respectively, whereas after separation of minerals, the concentrations in the ilmenite fraction were 2240 +/- 64 and 6125 +/- 485 Bq kg(-1) (dw), respectively. Tantalite displayed the highest concentrations with 44 738 +/- 2474 Bq kg(-1) of U-238. Radiation exposure of workers in mining facilities is likely to occur at levels above the dose limit for members of the public (1 mSv y(-1)) and therefore radiation doses should be assessed as occupational exposures. Local populations living in these regions in general are not exposed to segregated minerals with high radionuclide concentrations. However, there is intensive artisanal mining and a large number of artisanal miners and their families may be exposed to radiation doses exceeding the dose limit. A radiation protection programme is therefore needed to ensure radiation protection of the public and workers of developing mining projects.

ASSESSMENT OF NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY LEVELS IN ROCKS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE OF JOHOR STATE, MALAYSIA	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							BUILDING-MATERIALS; GRANITE; CYPRUS	The distribution of natural radionuclides (U-238, Th-232 and K-40) and their radiological hazard effect in rocks collected from the state of Johor, Malaysia were determined by gamma spectroscopy using a high-purity germanium detector. The highest values of U-238, Th-232 and K-40 activity concentrations (67 +/- 6, 85 +/- 7 and 722 +/- 18 Bg kg(-1), respectively) were observed in the granite rock. The lowest concentrations of U-238 and Th-232 (2 +/- 0.1 Bq kg(-1) for U-238 and 2 +/- 0.1 Bq kg(-1) for Th-232) were observed in gabbro rock. The lowest concentration of K-40 (45 +/- 2 Bq kg(-1)) was detected in sandstone. The radium equivalent activity concentrations for all rock samples investigated were lower than the internationally accepted value of 370 Bq kg(-1). The highest value of radium equivalent in the present study (239 +/- 17 Bq kg(-1)) was recorded in the area of granite belonging to an acid intrusive rock geological structure. The absorbed dose rate was found to range from 4 to 112 nGy h(-1). The effective dose ranged from 5 to 138 mu Sv h(-1). The internal and external hazard index values were given in results lower than unity. The purpose of this study is to provide information related to radioactivity background levels and the effects of radiation on residents in the study area under investigation. Moreover, the relationships between the radioactivity levels in the rocks within the geological structure of the studied area are discussed.	[Alnour, I.

ASSESSMENT OF NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY LEVELS AND ASSOCIATED DOSE RATES IN SOIL SAMPLES FROM NORTHERN RAJASTHAN, INDIA	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							GAMMA-RAY SPECTROMETRY; RA-226; TH-232; AREAS	The analysis of naturally occurring radionuclides (Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40) has been carried out in 40 soil samples collected from four districts of the Northern Rajasthan, India using gamma-ray spectrometry with an NaI(Tl) detector. The activity concentrations of the samples range from 38 +/- 9 to 65 +/- 11 Bq kg(-1) with a mean value of 52 Bq kg(-1) for Ra-226, from 8 +/- 8 to 32 +/- 9 Bq kg(-1) with a mean value of 19 Bq kg(-1) for Th-232 and from 929 +/- 185 to 1894 +/- 249 Bq kg(-1) with a mean value of 1627 Bq kg(-1) for K-40. The measured activity concentration of Ra-226 and K-40 in soil was higher and for Th-232 was lower than the worldwide range. Radium equivalent activities were calculated for the soil samples to assess the radiation hazards arising due to the use of these soils in the construction of buildings. The calculated average radium equivalent activity was 205 +/- 20 Bq kg(-1), which is less than the recommended limit of 370 Bq kg(-1) by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The total absorbed dose rate calculated from the activity concentration of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 ranges from 77 to 123 nGy h(-1) with an average value of 103 nGy h(-1). The mean external (H-ex) and internal hazard indices (H-in) for the area under study were determined to be 0.55 and 0.69, respectively. The corresponding average annual effective dose was found to be 0.63 mSv.

Uncertainties in these data are propagated through the analysis of every UF6 measurement and have implications for safeguards conclusions drawn from them. In this paper, a value for the specific F(alpha,n) yield in UF6 from U-234 is calculated from measurements of 30B cylinders containing bulk UF6 at the Rokkasho Enrichment Plant in Japan. The measurements were taken using the Uranium Cylinder Assay System. The yield was derived by combining the cylinder measurements with detailed Monte Carlo modeling, known isotopic composition, and inversion analysis. We calculated the U-234 neutron emission rate in UF6 to be (474 +/- 21) nls.g(-1) with a 68% confidence level. The results obtained in this study will help enable an important class of nondestructive assay instruments to be applied with greater confidence and accuracy.

Utilizing various international studies regarding nuclear fuel reprocessing, this study reaches an objective conclusion while taking into consideration the various variable and stable costs for the open and closed cycles. A sensitivity analysis was then introduced which identifies the most influential parameters in the final price. This analysis is essential in understanding the results obtained and emphasizes the need to specify a range of costs for both cycles and to see what factors affect these results. The sensitivity analysis describes the factors that play a large role in determining costs and will display the range of values that arise from the variability of costs for those factors. The uncertainty analysis compares the nominal values used in this study and describes how these values are likely to change with time resulting in a range of values for both cycles.

Carcinogenic and inflammatory effects of plutonium-nitrate retention in an exposed nuclear worker and beagle dogs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						Plutonium; inhalation; inflammatory-responses; apoptosis	NORMAL TISSUE-INJURY; IONIZING-RADIATION; PULMONARY-FIBROSIS; LUNG-CANCER; RESPONSES; STRESS; (PUO2)-PU-239; PATHOGENESIS; ACTIVATION; INHALATION	Purpose: Plutonium-nitrate has a moderately rapid translocation rate from the lung to blood stream. Previous studies have shown an unexpected retention of soluble plutonium in the beagles and human case studied here. The inflammatory responses that may be associated with long-term exposure to ionizing radiation were characterized. These pathways include tissue injury, apoptosis, and gene expression modifications. Other protein modifications related to carcinogenesis and inflammation and the various factors that may play a role in orchestrating complex interactions which influence tissue integrity following irradiation were investigated. Materials and methods: We have examined numerous lung samples from a plutonium-exposed worker, a human control, and a variety of plutonium-exposed beagle dogs using immunohistochemistry and quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Results : The exposed human showed interstitial fibrosis in peripheral regions of the lung, but no pulmonary tumors. Beagles with similar doses were diagnosed with tumors in bronchiolo-alveolar, peripheral and sub-pleural alveolar regions of the lung. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay showed an elevation of apoptosis in tracheal mucosa, tumor cells, and nuclear debris in the alveoli and lymph nodes of the beagles but not in the human case. In both the beagles and human there were statistically significant modifications in the expression of Fas ligand (FASLG), B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), and Caspase 3 (CASP3). Conclusions : The data suggests that FASLG, BCL2, CASP3 and apoptosis play a role in the inflammatory responses following prolonged plutonium exposure. Utilizing these unique tissues revealed which pathways are triggered following the internal deposition and long-term retention of plutonium-nitrate in a human and a large animal model.

J	Pukari, M; Takano, M				Pukari, Merja; Takano, Masahide			Sintering and characterization of ZrN and (Dy,Zr)N as surrogate materials for fast reactor nitride fuel	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							URANIUM MONONITRIDE; SOLID-SOLUTIONS; SOLUBILITY	Pellets of inert matrix material ZrN, and surrogate nitride fuel material (Dy0.4Zr0.6)N, are fabricated for the purpose of investigating the origin and the effect of carbon and oxygen impurity concentrations. Oxygen concentrations of up to 1.2 wt% are deliberately introduced into the materials with two separate methods. The achievable pellet densities of these materials, as a function of O content, sintering temperature and dimensional powder properties are determined. O dissolved into (Dy,Zr)N increases the achievable densities to a larger extent than if dissolved into ZrN. The segregation of O-rich phases in ZrN indicates a low O solubility in the material. Oxygen pick-up during the fabrication of the product as well as its exposure to air is demonstrated. The quality of the materials is monitored by the systematic analysis of O, N and C contents throughout the fabrication and sintering processes, supported by XRD and SEM analyses.
