In this study, we describe the practical application of MARSSIM process in performing a site remediation and conducting a final status survey and discuss the lessons learned. The release criterion for the site and the building were set up using site-specific parameters that were calculated using RESRAD and RESRAD-Build codes. The planning stage of the final status survey consisted of classifying the site, identifying the survey units and selecting the background reference area using the DQO process. The planning, implementation and assessment of the final status survey for the site and the building of the Uranium Conversion Plant were carried out to demonstrate that residual radioactivity levels meet the release criterion. The null hypothesis must reject in order to demonstrate the objective, null hypothesis is that residual radioactivity in the survey unit exceed the release criterion. The survey results containing the hot spots in the building, a nonparametric statistical test (Wilcoxon Rank Sum) was chosen for assessment due to the presence of the uranium contamination in background soil. The final status survey results showed that the release criteria were satisfied. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

P. solenopsis has been listed as a quarantine insect in Europe and China. The utilization of phytosanitary irradiation as a potential treatment for disinfesting agricultural commodities in trade has expanded rapidly in recent years. A reasonable dose of radiation to eliminate P. solenopsis needs to be determined, taking into account the side effects of radiation on agricultural products and the species-specific tolerance of the insect to radiation. We applied radiation ranging from 50 to 200 Gy to P. solenopsis to determine the optimal dose. Both the radiation dose and the developmental stage of the insect were independent variables. Higher doses of radiation or lesser mature insect stages provided more effective treatment. In nymphs, a radiation dose of 100 Gy caused extinction of the irradiated population by disrupting ovary development, while 150 Gy caused 100% mortality. In adults, all tested doses of irradiation did not affect longevity, but we were able to prevent reproduction with high (150 and 200 Gy) doses. In P. solenopsis, a 100 Gy dose of radiation could eliminate the irradiated population in two generations. The mortality curve showed a steep slope beyond 150 Gy; thus, if killing all of the insects in a shorter amount of time is necessary, 200 Gy may be a reasonable dose for the quarantine treatment of the solenopsis mealybug.

A new non-destructive gamma spectrometric method for HEU age-dating is reported. This method relies on measuring the daughter/parent activity ratio Th-227/U-235 by high-resolution gamma spectrometry. Only a narrow gamma range of energy of uranium from 230 keV to 242 key will be used for analysis. The relative efficiency of every characteristic gamma ray changes in a small range because it has a near energy, which makes the results more accurate in theory. It provides a quick and reliable method for HEU age determination. Several gamma spectra of the same HEU assembly have been measured with different conditions (gain settings, distance and measurement time). When a branching ratio of 12.6% was chosen for the 235.96 keV line of Th-227, we obtained the activity ratios of (5.61 +/- 0.40) x 10(-4), (5.17 +/- 0.39) x 10(-4), (5.26 +/- 0.39) x 10(-4), (5.10 +/- 0.35) x 10(-4), (5.50 +/- 0.44) x 10(-4) and (5.47 +/- 0.42) x 10(-4), respectively. These ratios correspond to ages of 52.2 +/- 2.4 years, 49.7 +/- 2.3 years, 50.1 +/- 2.3 years, 49.3 +/- 2.2 years, 51.6 +/- 2.5 years and 51.5 +/- 2.4 years, respectively, which are consistent with the known age of this material and the results of the U-Bi method.

Statistical uncertainties of nondestructive assay for spent nuclear fuel by using nuclear resonance fluorescence	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Nondestructive assay; Nuclear resonance fluorescence; Laser Compton scattering; Mono-energetic photon beam	SCATTERING	We estimated statistical uncertainties of a nondestructive assay system using nuclear resonance fluorescence (NRF) for spent nuclear fuel including low concentrations of actinide nuclei with an intense, mono energetic photon beam. Background counts from radioactive materials inside the spent fuel were calculated with the ORIGEN2.2-UPJ burn-up computer code. Coherent scattering contribution associated with Rayleigh, nuclear Thomson, and Delbruck scattering was also considered. The energy of he coherent scattering overlaps with that L of NRF transitions to the ground state. Here, we propose to measure NRF transitions to the first excited state to avoid the coherent scattering contribution. Assuming that L the total NRF cross-sections are in the range of 3-100 eV b at excitation energies of 225, 3.5, and 5 MeV, statistical uncertainties of the NRF measurement were estimated. We concluded that it is possible to assay 1% actinide content in the spent fuel with 2.2-32% statistical precision during 40005 measurement time for the total integrated cross-section of 30 eV b at excitation energies of 3.5-5 MeV by using a photon beam with an intensity of 106 photons/s/eV. We also examined both the experimental and theoretical NRF cross-sections for actinide nuclei. The calculation based On the quasi-particle random phase approximation suggests the existence of strong magnetic dipole resonances at excitation energies ranging from 2 to 6 MeV with the scattering cross-sections of tens eV b around 5 MeV in U-238.

Quantification of fissionable materials in pure and mixed form using photofission	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Photofission; Delayed neutron; Delayed gamma; Decay curve; Decay group; Fissile material assay	NUCLEAR-WASTE PACKAGES; PHOTON INTERROGATION; FISSILE MATERIALS; DELAYED GAMMAS; IDENTIFICATION	Photofission experiments have been conducted at the industrial 10 MeV LINAC of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, to develop a method for quantification of actinides. A number of natural uranium and thorium samples were fabricated in pure and mixed forms and irradiated for photofission. Delayed neutron and delayed gamma decay data produced after photofission were analyzed by the formation of decay groups, for 10 MeV end point energy. A method for quantification of relative proportions of actinides is developed and it is observed that under constant experimental conditions, even with an industrial accelerator, quantification of actinide in mixed state can be carried out with a reasonable accuracy and with a maximum error in estimation of less than 40%.

HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						environmental transport; National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements; risk assessment; risk communication	MAYAK WORKERS; LUNG-CANCER; PLUTONIUM; EXPOSURE; URANIUM	This article examines the question, "Is risk assessment fuzzy, or is it a quantitative science?'' In the context of this paper, risk assessment is defined as the estimation of health risk to people from exposure to radioactive materials and chemicals when they are released to the environment by a source. Today we employ risk assessment to investigate past, present, and future exposures, and the outcomes of the analysis are used for determining compliance with regulations, emergency response, facility design, and health impacts to populations from historical exposures (dose reconstruction). Risk assessment has become an essential component of government policy and decision-making, and it is clear it will be used increasingly in the future. It has undergone a dramatic evolution since the early 1970s both as a scientific methodology and also in how it is used. The key to understanding risk assessment is to explain the basic components and unique disciplines that meld it together. Each element requires skills in fundamental sciences such as engineering, physics, mathematics, and physiology in order to produce information required for the next step. As each step is developed, a clear interdependence emerges, resulting in a science that is quantitative and reliable and provides a tool for many purposes. In the end, however, it is how we communicate the results that becomes the most important component.

SINCLAIR KEYNOTE ADDRESS-THE FUKUSHIMA NUCLEAR POWER PLANT ACCIDENT AND COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH RISK MANAGEMENT	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						dose reconstruction; exposure, radiation; health effects; National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements; Chernobyl; Fukushima	THYROID-CANCER RISK; CHERNOBYL ACCIDENT; RADIATION; UKRAINE; CHILDHOOD; EXPOSURE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; BYELARUS; RUSSIA	Just two years have passed since the Tokyo Electric Power Company-Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) accident, a multidimensional disaster that combined to destroy the local infrastructure on which the safety system depended and gave a serious impact to the world. Countermeasures including evacuation, sheltering, and control of the food chain were implemented in a timely manner by the Japanese government. However, there is a clear need for improvement, especially in the areas of nuclear safety and protection and also in the management of the radiation health risk during and even after the accident. To date there have been no acute radiation injuries. The radiation-related physical health consequences to the general public, including evacuees, are likely to be much lower than those arising from the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident, because the radiation fallout and the subsequent environmental contamination were much more limited. However, the social, psychological, and economic impacts of the Fukushima NPP accident are expected to be considerable. Currently, continued monitoring and characterization of the levels of radioactivity in the environment and foods in Fukushima are vital for obtaining informed consent to the decisions on living in the areas already radiocontaminated and returning back to the evacuated areas once re-entry is permitted; it is also important to perform a realistic assessment of the radiation doses on the basis of measurements. We are currently implementing the official plans of the Fukushima Health Management Survey, which includes a basic survey for the estimation of the external doses that were received during the first 4 mo after the accident and four more detailed surveys (thyroid ultrasound examination, comprehensive health check-up, mental health and life-style survey, and survey of pregnant women and nursing mothers), with the aim to take care of the health of all of the residents of the Fukushima Prefecture for a long time.

For comparison purposes, the occupational doses due to the other two major reactor accidents (Windscale in the United Kingdomin 1957 and Three Mile Island in the United States in 1979) and to the main plutonium-producing facility in the United States (Hanford Works) are also covered but in less detail. Both for the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident and the routine operations at Mayak, the considerable efforts made to reconstruct individual doses from external irradiation to a large number of workers revealed that the recorded doses had been overestimated by a factor of about two.

JOINT US/RUSSIAN STUDIES OF POPULATION EXPOSURES RESULTING FROM NUCLEAR PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES IN THE SOUTHERN URALS	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						dose assessment; epidemiology; National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements; radiation effects	FILM DOSIMETER RESPONSE; TECHA RIVER COHORT; MAYAK WORKER DOSIMETRY; CANCER-MORTALITY; DISEASES; PLUTONIUM; HEALTH; RISKS; LUNG; PA	Beginning in 1948, the Soviet Union initiated a program for production of nuclear materials for a weapons program. The first facility for production of plutonium was constructed in the central portion of the country east of the southern Ural Mountains, about halfway between the major industrial cities of Ekaterinburg and Chelyabinsk. The facility, now known as the Mayak Production Association, and its associated town, now known as Ozersk, were built to irradiate uranium in reactors, separate the resulting plutonium in reprocessing plants, and prepare plutonium metal in the metallurgical plant. The rush to production, coupled with inexperience in handling radioactive materials, led to large radiation exposures, not only to the workers in the facilities, but also to the surrounding public. Fuel processing started with no controls on releases, and fuel dissolution and accidents in reactors resulted in release of similar to 37 PBq of I-131 between 1948 and 1967. Designed disposals of low-and intermediate-level liquid radioactive wastes, and accidental releases via cooling water from tank farms of high-level liquid radioactive wastes into the small Techa River, caused significant contamination and exposures to residents of numerous small riverside villages downstream of the site. Discovery of the magnitude of the aquatic contamination in late 1951 caused revisions to the waste handling regimes, but not before over 200 PBq of radionuclides (with large contributions of Sr-90 and Cs-137) were released. Liquid wastes were diverted to tiny Lake Karachay (which today holds over 4 EBq); cooling water was stopped in the tank farms. In 1957, one of the tanks in the tank farm overheated and exploded; over 70 PBq, disproportionately Sr-90, was blown over a large area to the northeast of the site. A large area was contaminated and many villages evacuated. This area today is known as the East Urals Radioactive Trace (EURT). Each of these releases was significant; together they have created a unique group of cohorts with their chronic, low dose-rate radiation exposure. The 26,000 workers at Mayak were highly exposed to external gamma and inhaled plutonium. A cohort of individuals raised as children in Ozersk is under evaluation for their exposures to radioiodine. The Techa River Cohort consists of over 30,000 people who were born before the start of exposure in 1949 and lived along the Techa River. The Techa River Offspring Cohort consists of similar to 21,000 persons born to one or more exposed parents of this group, many who also lived along the contaminated river. The EURT Cohort consists of similar to 18,000 people who were evacuated from the EURT soon after the 1957 explosion and another 8,000 who remained. These groups together are the focus of dose reconstruction and epidemiological studies funded by the United States, Russia, and the European Union to address the question, "Are doses delivered at low dose rates as effective in producing health effects as the same doses delivered at high dose rates?''

J	Boice, JD				Boice, John D., Jr.			IMPLICATIONS OF RADIATION DOSE AND EXPOSED POPULATIONS ON RADIATION PROTECTION IN THE 21ST CENTURY	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements; radiation dosimetry; radiation epidemiology; radiation protection	TECHA RIVER COHORT; CHILDHOOD-CANCER SURVIVOR; ATOMIC-BOMB SURVIVORS; NUCLEAR-POWER-PLANTS; IONIZING-RADIATION; DECISION-MAKING; THYROID-CANCER; RECONSTRUCTION SYSTEM; YOUNG-CHILDREN; UNITED-STATES	Radiation is in the public eye because of Fukushima, computed tomography examinations, airport screenings, and possible terrorist attacks. What if the Boston Marathon pressure cooker had also contained a radioactive source? Nuclear power may be on the resurgence. Because of the increasing uses of radiation, the increases in population exposures, and the increasing knowledge of radiation effects, constant vigilance is needed to keep up with the changing times. Psychosocial disorders associated with the inappropriate (but real) fear of radiation need to be recognized as radiation detriments. Radiation risk communication, radiation education, and communication must improve at all levels: to members of the public, to the media, to other scientists, and to radiation professionals. Stakeholders must continue to be involved in all radiation protection initiatives. Finally, we are at a crisis as the number of war babies (me) and baby boomers (you?) who are also radiation professionals continues its rapid decline, and there are few in the pipeline to fill the current and looming substantial need: "The old road is rapidly agin''' (Dylan). NCRP has begun the WARP initiative-Where Are the Radiation Professionals?-an attempt to rejuvenate the pipeline of future professionals before the trickle becomes tiny drops. A Workshop was held in July 2013 with government agencies, military, private sector, universities, White House representatives, and societies to develop a coordinated and national action plan. A "Manhattan Project'' is needed to get us "Back to the Future'' in terms of the funding levels that existed in years past that provided the necessary resources to train, engage, and retain (a.k.a., jobs) the radiation professionals needed for the nation. If we don't keep swimmin' (Disney's Nemo) we'll "sink like a stone'' (Dylan).

They will provide significantly higher light yield, an efficient interaction with electromagnetic probes due to the content of high-Z elements, a wider range of emission wavelength to adapt to the appropriate photo sensors and remain more resistant to radiation damage for long-term applications in highly radioactive environments. The HP3-WP22 collaboration has focused on the optimization of the micro-pulling-down technique and the quality inspection of fibers made of LuAG:Ce and LYSO:Ce, respectively. In spite of the more challenging growing conditions, the ongoing R&D program has been directed towards fibers based on LYSO:Ce. The very radiation hard and bright scintillator material appears to be attractive for many applications in particular due to its very short radiation length. Fibers up to 2 mm in diameter and more than 100 mm in length were successfully produced and show a very promising performance. The paper will discuss in detail measurements of the achieved light output and attenuation in the fiber as well as the homogeneity of the produced samples. For further optimization of the technology, a comparison of the fiber quality and the growth parameters is given.

Comparison of Radiation Damage Effects in PWO Crystals Under 150 MeV and 24 GeV High Fluence Proton Irradiation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Calorimetry; lead tungstate; radiation detectors; radiation effects; scintillator	LEAD TUNGSTATE CRYSTALS; PANDA ELECTROMAGNETIC CALORIMETER; HIGH-ENERGY PROTON; SCINTILLATION CRYSTAL; RECOVERY; CMS	Radiation damage effects induced by the hadronic part of ionizing radiation in experiments at high-energy and high-luminosity accelerators will play a significant role as limiting factor of the long term stability when operating an experimental setup. Measurements of the deterioration of the optical transmission of lead tungstate (PbWO4, PWO) scintillation crystals were performed after irradiation with high and low energy protons. One sample with CMS specification was irradiated in 2010 with a 24 GeV/c proton beam at the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS) with a flux of about 10(9) p/(cm(2) s) up to an accumulated fluence of 3.0 10(13) p/cm(2). Eight more crystals of PWO-II quality with dimensions of 2 x 2 x 5 cm(3) were selected from the set of crystals produced for the PANDA electromagnetic calorimeter at the future FAIR facility at Darmstadt. Four crystals were produced by the Bogoroditsk Technical Chemical Plant (Russia) and the others by the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics (China). These samples were irradiated in 2012 with a 150 MeV proton beam at the AGOR accelerator at KVI (Groningen, The Netherlands) with a flux of 3 10(9) up to an integral fluence of 1.0 10(12) about p/cm(2) and 1.8 10(13) p/cm(2), respectively. Due to the proton induced activation of long-lived radioactive secondaries the optical inspection of all samples had to be performed several months after irradiation for safety reasons. However, the samples were kept continuously cold to minimize thermal recovery. Both irradiations produced a similar set of induced absorption bands. Moreover, a shift of the fundamental absorption edge at short wavelength appears even after irradiation with low energy protons. The contribution will show in detail the set of experimental data and discuss a possible mechanism for an understanding and interpretation of the observed effects.

The adsorption behavior of uranyl ions onto the ATAs was studied in batch experiments. The effects of the contact time, initial concentration of the ions, temperature, and pH value. The salinity were investigated along with the adsorption kinetics and the adsorption isotherms. The kinetic experimental data followed the pseudo second-order kinetic model, and the adsorption isotherms correlated well with the Langmuir model. The ATAs showed good efficiency in adsorbing uranyl ions, with the best saturation adsorption capacity being 64.26 mg g(-1) for ATA-DETA within 120 min. The temperature dependence of ATA-DETA was quite abnormal and the quickest behavior was obtained at 25 degrees C. ATAs showed good adsorption capacity over a wide pH range of 4.0-8.5, and HCl could be used in the elution process. Salinity of the solution had great effect on the adsorption capacity, 3.5% salinity resulted in a 55% loss of capacity from ATA-DETA. The selectivity of ATA-DETA showed an order of: UO22+approximate to Fe3+ > Zn2+ > VO3- > Co2+ > Ni2+.

This last aspect is the major impediment to perform an extensive exploration of the design space, mainly due to the time lost evaluating non promising solutions. In this work, we show how we can train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to predict the reactor behavior for a given configuration. The trained MLP is able to evaluate the configurations immediately, thus allowing performing an exhaustive evaluation of the possible configurations derived from a stock of fuel lattices, fuel reload patterns and control rods patterns. For our particular problem, the number of configurations is approximately 7.7 x 10(10); the evaluation with the core simulator would need above 200 years, while only 100 hours were required with our approach to discern between bad and good configurations. The later were then evaluated by the simulator and we confirm the MLP usefulness. The good core configurations reached the energy requirements, satisfied the safety parameter constrains and they could reduce uranium enrichment costs.

Neutron spectrum in an irradiation chamber of a research reactor was measured by using activation method when the reactor is in normal operation under 2 MW. Sixteen kinds of non-fission foils (19 reaction channels) were selected, of which 10 were sensitive to thermal and intermediate energy regions, while the others were of different threshold energy and sensitive to fast energy regions. By measuring the foil radioactivity, the neutron spectrum was unfolded with the iterative methods SAND-II and MSIT. Finally, shielding corrections of group cross-section and main factors affecting the calculation accuracy were studied and the uncertainty of solution was analyzed using the Monte Carlo method in the process of SAND-II.

The surfaces of samples exposed to plasma during 2008-2009 campaigns as part of the second phase of a comprehensive first mirror test contained a mixture of carbon, beryllium and tritium. For this reason, the samples were treated in a vacuum chamber constructed specially for this purpose. In some cases mirrors show an increase of the specular reflectivity after cleaning, though beryllium and carbon deposits were not fully removed. Additionally, three samples coated in PISCES-B with a 110-120 nm beryllium layer were subjected to laser cleaning tests as well. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The counter consists of 16 He-3 cylindrical gas-filled proportional counters at 4 atm of pressure embedded in high-density polyethylene. In this work, experimental measurements were performed at LANL to characterize the performance of the PNAR counter using surrogate materials for the uranium metal ingot. The purpose of these experiments was to: 1) measure the operating and calibration parameters of the PNAR counter (e.g. efficiency profiles, coincidence gate fractions, die-away time) and 2) evaluate the accuracy and sensitivity of the PNAR method and the time correlated induced fission (TCIF) method for quantifying the U-235 mass in PWR fresh LEU fuel rods and Materials Testing Reactor (MTR) HEU fuel plates. A small Cm-244 reference source (13,373 n/s) was placed in the center of the fuel rods and fuel plates to simulate spontaneous fission from sub-ppm (parts per million) levels of Cm contamination in the U ingot. In order to compare the relative accuracy of the PNAR and TCIF methods for quantifying U-235 mass, calibration curves were generated for the net doubles rate and the doubles Cd ratio using the Deming software. The results from this experiment will be used to obtain a better understanding of the sensitivity of the PNAR and TCIF methods for samples with low neutron multiplication. Furthermore, this experimental measurement data will also help inform safeguards research and development (R&D) efforts on the viability of nondestructive assay (NDA) techniques and detector designs for quantifying fissile content in ER product materials. Future work will include performing measurements with the PNAR counter on small samples of U/TRU materials. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute has been studying pyroprocess technology, and the conceptual design of an engineering-scale pyroprocess facility, called the Advanced Fuel Cycle (AFC) facility, has been performed on the basis of a 10tHM throughput per year. In this paper, the concept of the AFC facility was introduced, and its safety evaluations were performed. For the safety evaluations, anticipated accident events were selected, and environmental safety analyses were conducted for the safety of the public and workers. In addition, basic radiation shielding safety analyses and criticality safety analyses were conducted. These preliminary safety studies will be used to specify the concept of safety systems for pyroprocess facilities, and to establish safety design policies and advance more definite safety designs.

A concrete cask usually consists of a metallic canister which confines the spent nuclear fuel assemblies and a concrete overpack. When the overpack undergoes a missile impact, which might be caused by a tornado or an aircraft crash, it should sustain an acceptable level of structural integrity so that its radiation shielding capability and the retrievability of the canister are maintained A missile impact against a concrete overpack produces two damage modes, local damage and global damage. In conventional approaches [1], those two damage modes are decoupled and evaluated separately. The local damage of concrete is usually evaluated by empirical formulas, while the global damage is evaluated by finite element analysis. However, this decoupled approach may lead to a very conservative estimation of both damages. In this research, finite element analysis with material failure models and element erosion is applied to the evaluation of local and global damage of concrete overpacks under high speed missile impacts. Two types of concrete overpacks with different configurations are considered. The numerical simulation results are compared with test results, and it is shown that the finite element analysis predicts both local and global damage qualitatively well, but the quantitative accuracy of the results are highly dependent on the fine-tuning of material and failure parameters.

NON DESTRUCTIVE APPLICATION OF RADIOACTIVE TRACER TECHNIQUE FOR CHARACTERIZATION OF INDUSTRIAL GRADE ANION EXCHANGE RESINS INDION GS-300 AND INDION-860	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Nuclear Grade Resins; Radioactive Tracer Isotopes; Non-destructive Technique; Characterization; Indion-860; Indion GS-300; I-131; Br-82; Reaction Kinetics; Ion-isotopic Exchange Reactions	DISTRIBUTION COEFFICIENT; ION; RADIOTRACER; DEPENDENCE; KINETICS	The paper deals with the application of radio isotopic non-destructive technique in the characterization of two industrial grade anion exchange resins Indion GS-300 and Indion-860. For the characterization of the two resins, I-131 and Br-82 were used as tracer isotopes to trace the kinetics of iodide and bromide ion-isotopic exchange reactions. It was observed that the values of specific reaction rate (min(-1)), amount of iodide ion exchanged (mmol), initial rate of iodide ion exchange (mmol/min) and log K-d were calculated as 0.328, 0.577, 0.189 and 19.7 respectively for Indion GS-300 resin, which was higher than the respective values of 0.180, 0.386, 0.070 and 17.0 calculated for Indion-860 resins when measured under identical experimental conditions. Also at a constant temperature of 40.0 degrees C, as the concentration of labeled iodide ion solution increases 0.001 M to 0.004 M, the percentage of iodide ions exchanged increases from 75.16 % to 78.36 % for Indion GS-300 resins, which was higher than the increases from 49.65 % to 52.36 % compared to that obtained for Indion-860 resins. The overall results indicate that under identical experimental conditions, Indion GS-300 resins show superior performance over Indion-860 resins.

The evolution of morphology, size, and BET surface area of the recycled U3O8 powders according to the respective variation of the thermo-mechanical treatment variables of oxidation temperature, powder milling, and sequential cyclic heat treatment of oxidation and then reduction was examined. The correlation between the BET surface area of recycled U3O8 powder and the sintered pellet properties of MnO-Al2O3 doped pellets showed that the pellet density and grain size of doped pellets were increased and then saturated by increasing the BET surface area of the recycled U3O8 powder. The density and grain size of the pellets were maximized when the BET surface area of the recycled U3O8 powder was in the vicinity of 3m(2)/g. Among the process variables applied in this study, the cyclic heat treatment followed by low temperature oxidation was a potential process combination to obtain the sinter-active U3O8 powder.

COUPLING OF A LUMPED PARAMETER AND A FINITE DIFFERENCE MODEL FOR ESTIMATION OF A REACTIVITY-INDUCED TRANSIENT IN A PWR WITH ANNULAR FUEL RODS	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						annular fuel element; neutron kinetics; thermal hydraulics	PRESSURIZED-WATER REACTORS	This paper develops a finite difference and a semianalytical model to evaluate the thermal behavior of fuel rods during a hypothetical reactivity-induced transient (absorber rod ejection) in a pressurized water reactor (PWR). The calculations are carried out for two different reactor core designs, namely, for a typical PWR core with typical fuel rods and for a modified PWR core containing annular fuel rods. The overall dimensions of the core internals and fuel assemblies are unchanged, and the total number of fuel assemblies is the same in both designs. The finite difference code was verified on the results provided by the semianalytical model. In the calculations, two point models were used (neutron kinetics to compute the fission power of the reactor; power balance of coolant in the active core region). The point models were coupled to the one-dimensional, finite difference heat conductivity model to calculate the radial temperature profile in the solid and the annular cylindrical pellets (UO2). The latter are the constituent part of annular fuel rods cooled both on their external and internal surfaces. The fuel, cladding, and fluid temperatures were evaluated for the annular and the solid fuel design in the hot spot, where the maximum allowable power rating of rods is 2.5 times higher than the average one. It was assumed that before the transient, (a) the reactor with annular fuel runs continuously at higher nominal power (150%) and at higher nominal coolant flow rate (150%) at the core inlet than the reference reactor with solid fuel (100%) and (b) the modified and the reference reactors have the same coolant temperature at the core inlet and the same temperature rise of coolant along their core. These conditions correspond to a 150% power uprate of the reference reactor. The coupled models require limited computational resources only. The calculated results showed that during the transient, in the annular fuel pellet, the temperatures peaked at considerably lower values, even at 150% power, than in the solid pellets at 100% power. These evaluations show that in the case of the reactivity-induced transient analyzed, the annular fuel cooled from both sides has a better safety performance than the solid fuel cooled only on its external stuface.

ON THE USE OF REDUCED-MODERATION LWRS FOR TRANSURANIC ISOTOPE BURNING IN THORIUM FUEL-L: ASSEMBLY ANALYSIS	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						thorium; transuranics; reduced-moderation LWR		Multiple recycle of transuranic (TRU) isotopes in thermal reactors results in degradation of the plutonium (Pu) fissile quality with buildup of higher actinides (e.g., Am, Cm, Cf), some of which are thermal absorbers. These phenomena lead to increasing amounts of Pu feed being required to sustain criticality and accordingly larger TRU content in the multirecycled fuel inventory, ultimately resulting in a positive moderator temperature coefficient (MTC) and void reactivity coefficient. Because of the favorable impact fostered by use of thorium (Th) on these coefficients, the feasibility of Th-TRU multiple recycle in reduced-moderation pressurized water reactors (PWRs) and boiling water reactors (BWRs) has been investigated. In this paper, Part I of two companion papers, the analysis is limited to a single assembly, with full-core models presented in Part II. Spatial separation of TRU from bred uranium is found to greatly improve neutronic performance. A large reduction in moderation is necessary to allow full actinide recycle. This will pose thermal-hydraulic challenges, which are discussed in Part II. In addition, the harder neutron spectrum resulting from the reduced moderation also reduces the control rod worth, while there is a neutronic incentive to use increased mechanical shim to maintain a negative MTC. It may therefore be desirable to increase the number of rod cluster control assemblies. Superior burnup is achievable in a reduced-moderation BWR as a larger reduction in moderation is feasible, although the incineration rate is reduced relative to a PWR due to a higher conversion ratio.

ON THE USE OF REDUCEDMODERATION LWRS FOR TRANSURANIC ISOTOPE BURNING IN THORIUM FUEL- II: CORE ANALYSIS	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						thorium; transuranics; reduced-moderation LWR	ROD BUNDLES; WATER-REACTOR	Multiple recycle of transuranic (TRU) isotopes in thermal reactors results in a degradation of the plutonium (Pu) fissile quality with buildup of higher actinides (e.g., Am, Cm, Cf), some of which are thermal absorbers. These phenomena lead to increasing amounts of Pu feed being required to sustain criticality and accordingly larger TRU content in the multirecycled fuel inventory, ultimately resulting in a positive moderator temperature coefficient (MTC) and void reactivity coefficient (VC). Because of the favorable impact fostered by use of thorium (Th) on these coefficients, the feasibility of Th-TRU multiple recycle in reduced-moderation (RM) pressurized water reactors (PWRs) and RM boiling water reactors (called RMPWRs and RBWRs, respectively) has been investigated. In this paper, Part II of two companion papers, the results of the single-assembly analyses of Part I are developed to investigate full-core feasibility. A large reduction in moderation is necessary to allow full actinide recycle. This increases the core pressure drop, which poses some thermal-hydraulic challenges, which are more pronounced if the design implementation is through retrofitting an existing PWR. For a given reactor cooling pump, the core flow rate is reduced. Despite this, it is possible to achieve feasible inlet and outlet temperatures and minimum departure from nucleate boiling ratio, for the reduction in moderation considered here. Reflood after loss-of-coolant accident is expected to be slower, which may lead to unacceptable peak clad temperatures and/or clad oxidation. Equilibrium cycles are presented for the RMPWR and RBWR, with a negative MTC and VC. However, the RMPWR may have positive reactivity when fully voided, and the hard spectrum makes it difficult to achieve an adequate shutdown margin, such that for the considered fuel designs, additional rod banks would be required.

UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS ON REACTIVITY AND DISCHARGED INVENTORY DUE TO U-235,U-238, Pu-239,Pu-240,Pu-241, AND FISSION PRODUCTS: APPLICATION TO A PRESSURIZED WATER REACTOR FUEL ASSEMBLY	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						uncertainty; nuclear data; inventory	NUCLEAR; SENSITIVITY	Uncertainty analysis on reactivity and discharged inventory for a typical pressurized water reactor fuel element as a result of uncertainties in (235,238)u, (IPu)-I-239,240,24, and fission products nuclear data was peiformed. A typical Westinghouse three-loop fuel assembly fueled with UO2 fuel with 4.8% enrichment was selected. The Total Monte Carlo method was applied using the deterministic transport code DRAGON. This code allows the generation of the few-groups nuclear data libraries by directly using data contained in the nuclear data evaluation files. The nuclear data used in this study are from the JEFF3.1 evaluation, with the exception of the nuclear data files for U, Pu, and fission products isotopes (randomized for the generation of the various DRAGON libraries). These are taken from the TALYS evaluated nuclear data library TENDL-2012. Results show that the calculated total uncertainty in keff (as a result of uncertainties in nuclear data of the considered isotopes) is virtually independent of fuel burnup, and amounts to 700 pcm. The uncertainties in the inventory of the discharged fuel are dependent on the element considered and lie in the range 1% to 15% for most fission products, and are <5% for the most important actinides. The total uncertainty on the reactor parameters was also split into different components (different nuclear reaction channels), and the main sources of uncertainties were identified.	[Da Cruz, D.

This system couples the use of a microfluidic sample chip with a robotic system designed to allow remote, automated sampling of process solutions in-cell and facilitates direct coupling of the microfluidic sample chip with analytical instrumentation. This system provides the capability for near-real-time analysis, reduces analytical waste, and minimizes the potential for personnel exposure associated with traditional sampling methods. A prototype sampling system was designed, built, and tested. System testing demonstrated operability of the microfluidic-based sample system and identified,system modifications to optimize performance.

Role of light and heavy minerals on natural radioactivity level of high background radiation area, Kerala, India	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Beach sediments; Natural radionuclides; Minerals; Statistical analysis	RIVER SEDIMENTS; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; RADIONUCLIDES; FTIR; PARTICLES; QUARTZ; COAST; SEA	Natural radionuclides (U-238, Th-232 and K-40) concentrations and eight different radiological parameters have been analyzed for the beach sediments of Kerala with an aim of evaluating the radiation hazards. Activity concentrations (U-238 and Th-232) and all the radiological parameters in most of the sites have higher values than recommended values. The Kerala beach sediments pose significant radiological threat to the people living in the area and tourists going to the beaches for recreation or to the sailors and fishermen involved in their activities in the study area. In order to know the light mineral characterization of the present sediments, mineralogical analysis has been carried out using Fourier transform infrared (FOR) spectroscopic technique. The eight different minerals are identified and they are characterized. Among the various observed minerals, the minerals such as quartz, microcline feldspar, kaolinite and calcite are major minerals. The relative distribution of major minerals is determined by calculating extinction co-efficient and the values show that the amount of quartz is higher than calcite and much higher than microcline feldspar. Crystallinity index is calculated to know the crystalline nature of quartz present in the sediments. Heavy mineral separation analysis has been carried out to know the total heavy mineral (THM) percentage. This analysis revealed the presence of nine heavy minerals. The minerals such as monazite, zircon, magnetite and illmenite are predominant. Due to the rapid and extreme changes occur in highly dynamic environments of sandy beaches, quantities of major light and heavy minerals are widely varied from site to site. Granulometric analysis shows that the sand is major content Multivariate statistical (Pearson correlation, cluster and factor) analysis has been carried out to know the effect of mineralogy on radionuclide concentrations. The present study concluded that heavy minerals induce the U-238 and Th-232 concentrations. Whereas, light mineral (calcite) controls the K-40 concentration. In addition to the heavy minerals, clay content also induces the important radioactive variables. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, the radioisotope Au3+ ions were prepared by dissolution of Au-198 foil, which was prepared by neutron irradiation from the HANARO reactor, in KCN aqueous solution. The successful synthesis of the radioisotope coordination polymer NPs with 5 +/- 0.5 nm was confirmed via UV-vis spectroscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry (EDXS), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Gamma spectroscopy analysis. The synthesized radioisotope coordination polymer NPs can be used as radiotracers in science, engineering, and industrial fields. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Detector efficiencies are characterized using single photon point-like standard sources at different distances; the calculated efficiencies for disc sources were analyzed by utilizing the double point detector model (DPDM) and the efficiency transfer method. The developed approach provided satisfactory results. The axial variation and radial dependence for disc sources efficiency determination in gamma-ray spectrometry were described with both gamma ray standard sources and measured samples as their extended sources.

Application of single-vial ready-for-use formulation of In-111- or Lu-177-labelled somatostatin analogs	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Somatostatin; Quenchers; Ethanol; Ascorbic acid; Gentisic acid; Radiochemical purity	RECEPTOR-POSITIVE TUMORS; RADIOLABELED PEPTIDES; RADIOCHEMICAL PURITY; RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY; DOTA-PEPTIDES; RADIOLYSIS; WATER; DTPA; RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS; RADIOACTIVITY	For the sake of safety it would be desirable to store and transport the ready-for-use liquid formulation (diagnostics and therapeutics) of radiolabelled peptides. The use of ethanol, in combination with a mixture of gentisic- and ascorbic acid, has superior effects on stabilizing radiolabelled somatostatin analogs. As a consequence, In-111- and Lu-177-labelled somatostatin analogs can be stored and transported in a single-vial ready-for-use liquid formulation up to 7 days after radiolabelling.

Production of medical radioisotopes with linear accelerators	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Radioisotopes; Electron accelerators; Photonuclear production	NUCLEAR-MEDICINE; REACTOR; RADIONUCLIDES; SEPARATION; CYCLOTRON; ISOTOPES; CU-64	In this study, we discuss producing radioisotopes using linear electron accelerators and address production and separation issues of photoneutron (gamma,n) and photoproton (gamma,p) reactions. While (gamma,n) reactions typically result in greater yields, separating product nuclides from the target is challenging since the chemical properties of both are the same. Yields of (gamma,p) reactions are typically lower than (gamma,n) ones, however they have the advantage that target and product nuclides belong to different chemical species so their separation is often not such an intricate problem. In this paper we consider two examples, Mo-100(gamma,n)Mo-99 and Zn-68(gamma,p)Cu-67, of photonuclear reactions. Monte-Carlo simulations of the yields are benchmarked with experimental data obtained at the Idaho Accelerator Center using a 44 MeV linear electron accelerator. We propose using a kinematic recoil method for photoneutron production. This technique requires Mo-100 target material to be in the form of nanoparticles coated with a catcher material. During irradiation, Mo-99 atoms recoil and get trapped in the coating layer. After irradiation, the coating is dissolved and Mo-99 is collected. At the same time, Mo-100 nanoparticles can be reused. For the photoproduction method, Cu-67 can be separated from the target nuclides, Zn-68, using standard exchange chromatography methods. Monte-Carlo simulations were performed and the Mo-99 activity was predicted to be about 7 MBq/(g*kW*h) while Cu-67 activity was predicted to be about 1 MBq/(g*kW*h). Experimental data confirm the predicted activity for both cases which proves that photonuclear reactions can be used to produce radioisotopes. Lists of medical isotopes which might be obtained using photonuclear reactions have been compiled and are included as well. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Production and quality control of radioactive yttrium microspheres for medical applications	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Yttrium microspheres; Brachytherapy microspheres; Seed source	RADIOTHERAPY; CANCER	In this paper, a method for production of yttrium silicate microspheres is reported. Yttrium silicate microspheres with approximate sizes of 20-50 mu m were obtained when an aqueous solution of Y(NO3)(3) was added to tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and was pumped into silicone oil under constant stirring. The shapes of the particles produced by the proposed method were regular and nearly spherical. The spherical shapes, composition and element distribution were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), carbon/sulfur analysis and SEM/EDS mapping analysis. Paper chromatography was used to identify radiochemical impurities in the radioactive microspheres. The radionuclide purity was determined using a gamma spectrometry system and an ultra-low-level liquid scintillation spectrometer. The results indicated that the proposed silicone oil spheroidization method is suitable for the production of yttrium silicate microspheres. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We tested various ligands on the silver rod surface to screen the one with the highest adsorption and specific radioactivity. In addition, we investigated the effect of surface etching to increase the adsorption capability followed by the extended surface area. We also found that the use of an oxidant during iodide adsorption can increase the loading significantly. The maximum activity of 137.90 MBq/rod (3.7269 mCi/rod) was achieved on the etched silver rods with phosphate ligand and hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. In addition, this is 4.5-fold higher than that of the conventional chloride treatment method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The radium equivalent activity (Ra-eq), the criterion formula (CF), indoor gamma absorbed dose rate (D-R), annual effective dose (H-R), activity utilization index (AUI), alpha index (I-alpha) gamma index (I-gamma), external radiation hazard index (H-ex), internal radiation hazard index (H-in), representative level index (RLI), excess lifetime cancer risk (ELCR) and annual gonadal dose equivalent (AGDE) associated with the natural radionuclides are calculated to assess the radiation hazard of the natural radioactivity in the building materials. From the analysis, it is found that these materials used for the construction of dwellings are safe for the inhabitants. The radiological data were processed using multivariate statistical methods to determine the similarities and correlation among the various samples. The frequency distributions for all radionuclides were analyzed. The data set consisted of 15 measured variables. The Pearson correlation coefficient reveals that the Ra-226 distribution in building materials is controlled by the variation of the K-40 concentration. Principal component analysis (PCA) yields a two-component representation of the acquired data from the building materials in Tiruvannamalai, wherein 94.9% of the total variance is explained. The resulting dendrogram of hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) classified the 30 building materials into four major groups using 15 variables. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Vieira, WS; Brandao, LEB; Braz, D				Vieira, Wilson S.; Brandao, Luis Eduardo B.; Braz, Delson			An alternative method for tracking a radioactive particle inside a fluid	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						CARPT; EM algorithm; Image reconstruction; Detection of gamma radiation; Radioactive tracer	MULTIPHASE FLOWS; SOLIDS; MOTION; BEDS	The proposed tracking method describes the trajectory of a radioactive particle moving in a fluid as a sequence of small cubic cells occupied by successive particle positions. In addition, the EM reconstruction algorithm was applied to get the image of the unique cell which had the greatest probability to contain the particle at a given time of a test. Next, this information was useful to calculate the coordinates and velocities of the particle at that time. The method was tested in laboratory using a gamma radiation detection system, the radioisotope Au-198 and a mixer. According to the results, the maximum deviation found between theoretical and experimental values of the average rotating period was less than 8% and the particle's reconstructed trajectories are representative of its real movement. Thus, a paradigm shift permitted us to begin the development of an alternative method to solve the complex problem of tracking the movement of a radioactive particle inside an opaque unit.

Numerical Solutions of the Poisson Equation: Condensation/Evaporation on Arbitrarily Shaped Aerosols	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							RADIOACTIVE AEROSOLS; CONTINUUM REGIME; DIFFUSION; PARTICLES	In the dry environments of high-temperature gas reactors, aerosols and dust particles can be highly nonspherical and even chainlike agglomerates, and are highly charged. To elucidate the role of both shape and charge on particle dynamics, we have explored numerical solutions of the Poisson equation for arbitrary geometries. In this paper, we describe the general computational framework, and report results for condensation' evaporation for several different cases, including chainlike agglomerates. We find that the shape factor based on the volume equivalent sphere approximation underestimates the actual condensation rate on the agglomerate, in addition to not accounting for the local condensation rates.

Computational Evaluation of Neutron Multiplicity Measurements of Polyethylene-Reflected Plutonium Metal	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							MONTE-CARLO-SIMULATION; DISTRIBUTIONS; FISSION	Simulations of neutron multiplicity measurements of a highly multiplicative plutonium sphere measured with a moderated array of He-3 proportional counters have consistently overpredicted the mean and variance of the measured multiplicity distribution. In contrast, identical experiments using a Cf-252 source have been accurately simulated. This paper outlines a sensitivity analysis of several key parameters that could account for the overprediction in the simulation of the plutonium sphere. Parameters that were analyzed include source-detector distance, detector dead time, variations in density and volume of the plutonium, and the value of (v) over bar for Pu-239-induced fission. Of these parameters, the only factor that accounted for the overprediction within reasonable bounds was a change in the value of the Pu-239 (v) over bar. The sensitivity analysis showed that a small change (1.14% reduction) in the value of (v) over bar dramatically improved the simulated results.	[Miller, E. C.; Clarke, S.

In the near future, we anticipate increased isotope production for use in nuclear medicine in Russia. The existing linear accelerator at the Institute for Nuclear Research (Moscow-Troitsk) and several prospective installations are considered to be particularly capable of providing mass production of radionuclides that can substitute, to a certain extent, for the traditional medical isotopes.

The effect of uranium migration on radionuclide distributions for soil samples at the El-Gor area, Sinai, Egypt	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						HP-Ge detector; CR-39; Radon concentration; Emanation coefficient; Radium content	RADON EXHALATION; NIGERIA	The concentrations and distributions of the activity of natural radionuclides in soil samples were investigated in fifteen soil samples at El-Gor area representing two profiles (A and B) using a HP-Ge detector and alpha counting by SSNTD (CR-39), respectively. The average concentrations of the radionuclides U-238, Ra-226, U-235, Th-232 and K-40 are 203.4, 177.23, 9.77, 43.33 and 386.22 Bq kg(-1) (dry weight), respectively, and profile A and U-238, Ra-226, U-235, Th-232 and K-40 have average concentrations of 232.58, 246,11.7, 31.7, and 277.07 Bq kg(-1) for profile B, respectively. The eTh and eU were estimated to detect the migration process of uranium into or out of an area or uranium to or from the studied profiles. The results indicate a migration of uranium by 29% for profile A and 65.37% for profile B. The activity ratio (U-238/Ra-226) was found to be 0.9 in profile A and 1.15 in profile B. These ratios coincide with the uranium migration processes. The responsible mass corresponding to the measured Ra-226 activity was also calculated. The radon activity concentrations for the two profiles are nearly 300 Bq m(-3). The emanation coefficient (eta) was calculated from the ratio of the expected radon activity to the measured radon for the studied soil samples. The value of eta was found to depend only on the radium activity regardless to soil formation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Nada, A.; Aly, H. A.

Dosimetric analysis of fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas, Rafinesque, 1820) exposed via ingestion to environmentally relevant activities of Ra-226 for two years	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						Ra-226-bioaccumulation; radium dosimetry; depuration; fish ingestion of radium	NONHUMAN BIOTA; MICROCOSM EXPERIMENTS; RADIONUCLIDE TRANSFER; INTERACTION STRENGTH; EXPERIMENTAL VENUE; LIMITED RELEVANCE; AQUATIC ORGANISMS; ECOSYSTEM ECOLOGY; URANIUM-MINE; RADIATION	Purpose: To assess the dosimetry of Ra-226 in a two-year chronic ingestion study in laboratory maintained fathead minnow fed environmentally relevant levels of the isotope known to occur in gut contents of fish from a uranium mining area. Methods: Fish were established on reconstituted commercial fish food containing 10 mBq-10 Bq Ra-226. g(-1) dry food. The fish were sampled at 1, 6, 18 and 24 months and the Ra-226 levels in the whole fish were directly determined using measurement performed using inorganic mass spectrometry. Pilot experiments using higher doses were also done during development of a liquid scintillation detection system which support some data. Results: The data show that after 1 month the levels of accumulation in the fish were below detection. At 6 months there was an activity dependent accumulation which was relatively higher in the low activity groups. By 18 and 24 months the radium was very low in all groups - well below 6 month levels suggesting considerable loss of radium from the fish. These data were confirmed in a small and shorter study using higher dietary activities. The highest dose calculated for any measurement point was 16 mu Gy. h(-1) in the 6-month-old fish fed the diet containing 10 Bq.g(-1) Conclusions: We conclude that environmentally relevant levels of Ra-226 have a maximum impact at early time-points when the fish are still growing. After that they appear to depurate accumulated radium. In terms of environmental impact, the maximum accumulation peaks at the age where fish could be spawning but is extremely low leading to mGy.year(-1) doses even after exposure to the high activity diets.

Systematic Raman scans were performed to study the relationship between typical Raman spectra and various oxide layer thicknesses. The thicknesses of the oxide layers developed for various exposure times were measured by cross-sectional Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The results of this work reveal that each oxide layer thickness has a corresponding typical Raman spectrum. Detailed analysis suggests that the Raman scattering peaks around wave numbers of 180 cm(-1) and 630 cm(-1) are the best choices for accurately determining the oxide layer thickness. After Gaussian-Lorentzian deconvolution, these two peaks can be quantitatively represented by four peaks. The intensities of the deconvoluted peaks increase consistently as the oxide layer becomes thicker and sufficiently strong signals are produced, allowing one to distinguish the bare and oxidized cladding samples, as well as samples with different oxide layer thicknesses. Hence, a process that converts sample oxide layer thickness to optical signals can be achieved. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Characterizations were performed by X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Helium release rate as a function of temperature and total helium quantity were measured using a Knudsen effusion mass spectrometer and a quantitative gas measurement system, respectively. A new model for the simulation of helium release has been developed taking into account single gas atom and bubble motion, trapping, grain and bubble growth. The model, embedded into commercial multiphysics software, provided a good description of the experimental data and correlations for gas-atom and bubble diffusion coefficients have been proposed. Finally, the effect of radiation damage on helium diffusion was assessed by comparing the results of the present study with literature data. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
