However, during rapid load-following events, traditional UOX cores could be restricted by the volatile oscillation of the power distribution. Therefore, a conceptual study on stability properties of Th-MOX PWR concerning axial offset power excursion during load-following events are investigated and discussed. The study is performed in SIMULATE-3 for a realistic PWR core (Ringhals-3) at the end of cycle, where the largest amplitude of the axial offset oscillations is expected. It is shown that the Th-MOX core possesses much better stability characteristics and shorter reactor dead time compared with a traditional UOX core, and the main reasons are the lower sensitivity to perturbations in the neutron spectrum, lower xenon poisoning and lower thermal neutron flux.

Discrimination of spent nuclear fuels in nuclear forensics through isotopic fingerprinting	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Nuclear forensics; SFCOMPO; Isotopic fingerprinting; Factor analysis		Isotopic fingerprinting in nuclear forensics, developed through a simulation study to resolve spent nuclear fuels from different reactors, has been applied on real samples from fuels irradiated in nuclear reactors. The U and Pu isotopics of the real samples, used as fingerprints, have been retrieved from the OECD/NEA SFCOMPO databank comprising compositions of spent nuclear fuels from their Post-Irradiation Examination at the End of their Irradiation (EOI). The method has grouped together nuclear spent fuels from the same reactor, resolving distinctly those with similar U-235 enrichment. Furthermore, spent fuel pins of the same enrichment, from different positions within a reactor core, are resolved. Differentiating of the spent fuels has been achieved, whether (U, Pu) or Pu are used as fingerprints. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Surfactant-impregnated activated carbon for enhanced adsorptive removal of Ce(IV) radionuclides from aqueous solutions	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Activated carbon; Cerium; Surfactant; Impregnation; Adsorption	RADIOACTIVE-WASTE SIMULANTS; HEAVY-METAL; CATIONIC SURFACTANT; ISOTHERM EQUATIONS; FUNCTIONAL-GROUPS; SORPTION; IONS; WATER; EQUILIBRIUM; FLOTATION	The surfactants cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium lauryl sulfate (NaLS) were utilized for modifying the activated carbon's surface. The materials were characterized using BET-N-2, scanning electron microscope, and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Adsorption of Ce(IV) radionuclides from aqueous solutions by activated carbon (AC) and surfactant-impregnated AC was studied. The obtained data showed that adsorption of Ce(IV) is strongly dependent on the solution pH and AC-NaLS exhibits the widest pH-range of maximum removal. The experimental adsorption capacity of AC-NaLS (0.069 mmol/g) for Ce(IV) is found to be nearly twice greater than that of AC (0.036 mmol/g). The adsorption kinetics of Ce(IV) onto AC and AC-NaLS were analyzed by linear and non-linear fittings to the pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order and Elovich kinetic models. Of these models, the pseudo-second-order is the best kinetic expression for describing the experimental data. The diffusion studies indicated that adsorption of Ce(IV) radionuclides on AC and AC-NaLS is controlled by film diffusion. Linear and non-linear fittings of the adsorption equilibrium data for Ce(IV) onto AC and AC-NaLS revealed that the Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) isotherm model fits the experimental data better than Freundlich and Langmuir models. The values of adsorption free energy, E, calculated from both linear and non-linear methods suggested that Ce(IV) radionuclides are physically adsorbed onto AC and AC-NaLS. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents the analysis of loss of pool cooling accident scenarios and the discussion of mitigation measures for the SFP at a pressurized water reactor (PWR) NPP with the MAAP5 code. Analysis of uncompensated loss of water due to the loss of pool cooling with different initial pool water levels of 12.2 m (designated as a reference case) and 10.7 m have been performed based on a MAAP5 input model. Scenarios of the accident such as overheating of uncovered fuel assemblies, oxidation of claddings and hydrogen generation, loss of intactness of fuel rod claddings, and release of radioactive fission products were predicted with the assumption that mitigation measures were unavailable. The results covered a broad spectrum of severe accident evaluations in the SFP. Furthermore, as important mitigation measures, the effects of recovering the SFP cooling system and makeup water in SFP on the accident progressions have also been investigated respectively based on the events of pool water boiling and spent fuels uncovery. Based upon the reference case, three cases with the recovery of SFP cooling system and three other cases with makeup water in SFP have been studied. The results showed that, severe accident might happen if SFP cooling system was not restored timely before the spent fuels started to become uncovered; spent fuels could be completely submerged and severe accident might be avoided if SFP makeup water system provided water with a mass flow rate larger than the average evaporation rate defined as the division of pool water mass above the top of the spent fuel assemblies by the amount of time to start uncovering the spent fuel assemblies when no mitigation measures were taken. Although spent fuel assemblies were partly exposed due to the mass flow rate of makeup water being smaller than the average evaporation rate, continuous steam cooling and radiation heat transfer might maintain the spent fuels coolability as the actual evaporation was balanced by the makeup in a period of time of the order of several days. However, larger makeup rate should be guaranteed to ensure the long-term safety of SFP. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Quantification of US spent fuel inventories in nuclear waste management	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Spent fuel; Radiotoxicity; Heat load; Nuclear waste management; Actinides; Fission products		The goal of this research was to develop a methodology to collect inventory estimates for the analysis of spent fuel in the United States. Data sets were collected from publicly available information on 103 operating U.S. reactors over the lifespan of each unit. SCALE 6.1's ORIGEN-ARP module was used to produce plant models for each reactor and inventory estimates for spent fuel removed 0, 1, 3, 5, 10, and 20 years ago. The analysis includes assessments of radiotoxicity and heat load levels. Reductions in radiotoxicity and heat load were quantified for the oldest spent fuel, and it was noted that the values were smaller for BWR assemblies due to lower enrichment levels. The obtained results serve as a guiding tool in evaluating spent fuel management strategies, including spent fuel pool conditions, dry cask loading sequences of interim storage options, and expectations for permanent disposal needs.

Steady-state and transient core feasibility analysis for a thorium-fuelled reduced-moderation PWR performing full transuranic recycle	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						PWR; Transuranic; Thorium; Mechanical shim; Rod-ejection accident; Shutdown margin	WATER-REACTOR; STRATEGY; DESIGN; LWRS	It is difficult to perform multiple recycle of transuranic (TRU) isotopes in PWRs as the moderator temperature coefficient (MTC) tends to become positive after a few recycles and the core may have positive reactivity when fully voided. Due to the favourable impact on the MTC fostered by use of thorium (Th), the possibility of performing Th-TRU multiple-recycle in reduced-moderation PWRs (RMPWRs) is under consideration. Heterogeneous fuel design with spatial separation of Th-U and Th-TRU is necessary to improve neutronic performance. This can take the form of a heterogeneous fuel assembly (TPUC), or whole assembly heterogeneity (WATU). Satisfactory discharge burn-up can be maintained while ensuring negative MTC, with the pin diameter of a standard PWR increased from 9.5 toll mm. However, the reactivity becomes positive when the coolant density in the core becomes extremely low. This could lead to positive reactivity in some loss of coolant accident (LOCA) scenarios, for example a surge line break, if the reactor does not trip. To protect against this beyond design basis accident, a second redundant set of shutdown rods is added to the reactor, so that either the usual or secondary rods can trip the reactor when there is zero coolant in the core. Even so, this condition is likely to be concerning from a regulatory standpoint. Reactivity control is a key challenge due to the reduced worth of neutron absorbers and their detrimental effect on the void coefficients, especially when diluted, as is the case for soluble boron. Mechanical shim is therefore employed. As a result, it is difficult to maintain adequate core power peaking over the cycle, and careful lattice and core design is required, particularly for the WATU design. An adequate shutdown margin (SDM) can be maintained in both cases, but this requires use of B4C rods with enriched Boron-10 in B. A higher Boron-10 enrichment is required for the TPUC fuel design. The response to a rod ejection accident (REA) is significantly worse than in conventional PWRs due to a lower delayed neutron fraction, but fuel enthalpy deposition limits can be satisfied.

Gamma/neutron time-correlation for special nuclear material detection - Active stimulation of highly enriched uranium	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Active interrogation; Special nuclear material; Monte Carlo simulations; Radiation detection	MCNPX-POLIMI; NONPROLIFERATION APPLICATIONS; NEUTRON DETECTION; INTERROGATION; SIMULATIONS; VALIDATION; SYSTEMS; BORDERS	The time-correlated pulse-height technique can distinguish multiplying (special nuclear material) from non-multiplying sources. The technique relies upon the measurement of correlated photon-neutron pairs using organic liquid scintillation detectors. For such interactions, the distribution of measured neutron recoil energy versus the time-of-flight difference between correlated photons and neutrons are imprinted with the fission chain dynamics of the source. The theoretical time-of-arrival assuming the photons and neutrons are created in the same fission is calculated. Correlated pairs with longer time-of-arrival indicate delays caused by self-induced fission chains in a multiplying source. For the specific circumstances of simulated measurements of 25.4 kg of highly enriched uranium at 50 cm source to detector distance, correlated pairs from fission chains can arrive upwards of 40 ns later than correlated pairs with the same neutron energies from non-multiplying sources like Cf-252 at the same source detector distance. The use of detectors with ns scale time resolution and the use of pulse digitization allows for the distinction of these events. This method has been used successfully in the past to measure a variety of plutonium-bearing samples. The particle transport code MCNPX-PoliMi has been used to simulate and validate these measurements as well. Due to the much lower signature emission rate of U-235, this technique has not yet been used to measure the presence of highly enriched uranium. In this work we therefore explore the use of the time-correlated pulse-height technique with the introduction of an interrogating neutron source to stimulate fission. The applicability of Cf-252, AmLi and a DD generator neutron sources is explored in a series of simulations. All three sources are viable options with their own pros and cons with the choice of appropriate source depending upon the intended application. The TCPH technique is envisioned as a viable measurement solution of special nuclear material in situations in which the presence of shielding material disqualifies the use of passive gamma spectroscopy or gamma spectroscopy reveals classified information on the special nuclear material's isotopic composition.

The removal efficiency according to the gravel size and weight and the removal efficiency according to the lapsed time using the manufactured equipment were investigated through several experiments. The volume of gravel in the high uranium concentration group was about 10%, the rock types of which were quartz, lamprophyre, and schist. The larger the gravel size, the higher the contaminated concentration of gravel. The average uranium (U-238) concentration of gravel after the first washing was about 1.45 Bq/g, and the average removal efficiency of gravel after the third washing was about 37%. In addition, the removal efficiency of the contaminated gravel was not related to its size. The contaminated concentration of the gravel decreased with an increasing gravel weight. In addition, the removal efficiency of contaminated gravel was not related to its weight. When the electrokinetic-electrodialytic decontamination period of 5 days, 10 days, 15 days, and 20 days elapsed, the U-238 in the gravel was removed by about 40%, 65%, 72%, and 81%. The more the electrokinetic-electrodialytic decontamination time elapsed, the more the removal efficiency ratio of U-238 decreased. Finally, the gravel with a size of less than 10 cm was treated by soil washing and electrokinetic decontamination methods with soil, and gravel with size of more than 10 cm but less than 20 cm was treated by gravel washing and electrokinetic-electrodialytic decontamination methods. Gravel with a size of more than 20 cm is treated by a gravel washing method, and gravel contaminated with a high concentration of uranium was treated by crushing and ball mill washing methods.

Resonance treatment for important minor actinides and other resonant absorbers has been carried out with subgroup method. The updated multi-group cross sections and subgroup data is replaced with existing multi-group library. The results from neutron transport code nTRACER with updated multi-group cross section library were compared with existing library and solutions from MCNP. The resonance interaction of uranium with important minor actinides has been accommodated through modified interference treatment by interference correction in subgroup method. The results for cross sections and multiplication factor for pin and assembly problems showed improvement from systematic resonance treatment for resonant absorber nuclides including (NP)-N-237 and Am-243.

Static neutronic calculation of a subcritical transmutation stellarator-mirror fusion-fission hybrid	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Fusion-fission hybrid; Spent nuclear fuel; MCNPX calculations; Effective multiplication factor; Neutron flux	NEUTRAL BEAM INJECTION; REACTOR; FIELD	The MCNPX Monte-Carlo code has been used to model the neutron transport in a sub-critical fast fission reactor driven by a fusion neutron source. A stellarator-mirror device is considered as the fusion neutron source. The principal composition for a fission blanket of a mirror fusion-fission hybrid is devised from the calculations. Heat load on the first wall, the distribution of the neutron fields in the reactor, the neutron spectrum and the distribution of energy release in the blanket are calculated. The possibility of tritium breeding inside the installation in quantities that meet the needs of the fusion neutron source is analyzed. The portion of the plasma column generates fusion neutrons that mainly do not reach the fission reactor core is proposed to be surrounded by a vessel filled with borated water to absorb the flying out neutrons. The flux of the neutrons escaping from the device to surrounding space is also calculated. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Chernitskiy, S.

According to the structure of GPHS-RTG (General Purpose Heat Source Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator), the fuel cell model and fuel assembly model of NBDEx were set up, and then their performances were analyzed with MCNP code. From these results, it was found that the power and power density of NBDEx were almost six times higher than the RTG's. For fully demonstrating the advantage of NBDEx, the analysis of its impact factors was performed with MCNP code, and its lifetime was also calculated using the Origen code. These results verified that NBDEx was more suitable for the space missions than RTG. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Thus, the modelling of possible accidents using computer codes and analysis of consequences is very important. This paper presents results of modelling of cooling water volume decrease events in the spent fuel pools using four different system codes RELAP5, RELAP/SCDAPSIM, ATHLET-CD and ASTEC. The work is aimed to identify possible unrealistic fuel storage pool parameter states, trends and values and to assess the possible errors caused as a result. The influence of the selected modelling assumptions, approximations and impact of the structure of the models on the substantial nuclear fuel storage pools parameters during the beyond design basis accident were investigated.

An extension of the point kinetics model of MIPR to include the effects of pressure and a varying surface height	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Point kinetics; Thermal hydraulics; Aqueous homogeneous reactor; Uranyl nitrate; CRAC		This work aims to expand upon a previous point kinetics model of an aqueous homogeneous reactor and make several additions to it including the effects of average pressure, plenum gas composition and temperature, vertical advection of solution due to voidage and thermal expansion and a neutron flux profile which varies in both time and height from the reactor base. It is found that these additions cause a small change to the reactor behaviour but the main advantage is to allow the modelling of different scenarios including failure of the gas management system which normally removes hydrogen and fission product gases from the plenum gas. Such a failure is seen to lead to a rapid increase in hydrogen content with implications for reactor safety. The model is also used to simulate the CRAC-43 experiment and, with the addition of simple models for the delay of radiolytic gas production due to the need to saturate the fuel solution and sloshing of the fuel solution, is found to approximate the experimental results well.

Distribution of natural and anthropogenic radionuclides in beach sand samples from Mediterranean Coast of Turkey	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Environmental radioactivity; Beach sand; XRF; Mediterranean	FUKUSHIMA NUCLEAR ACCIDENT; BLACK-SEA; RADIOACTIVITY LEVELS; FALLOUT	Following Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, a huge amount of radionuclides were released in atmosphere and ocean. It's impact on the environment is of great concern to the good of the public at large. In this regard environmental radioactivity monitoring such as external dose rate and radioactivity measurements in environmental samples has been carried out. For this purpose, several beach sand samples were collected from south coast of the Turkey in September 2011 and radioactivity concentrations of Ra-226 (U-238), Ac-226 (Th-232), K-40, Cs-134 and Cs-137 were determined by gamma spectrometry using a high-purity Germanium detector. The measured activity concentrations in beach sand samples ranged from 4.0 +/- 0.5 to 21.5 +/- 1.8 Bq/kg, 1.8 +/- 0.4 to 27.9 +/- 2.4 Bq/kg, 19.0 +/- 2.2 to 590.3 +/- 28.6 Bq/kg and 0.1 +/- 0.0 to 1.0 +/- 0.1 Bq/kg for Ra-226, Th-232, K-40 and Cs-137 , respectively. However there was no sign of Cs-134 in the sample spectrum after Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. Hence we can safely conclude that there was no significant material transfer from Fukushima to Turkey. The other activities are in good agreement with the published results of neighboring areas. The absorbed gamma dose rate (D) and the annual effective dose (AED) of beach sand samples were below the world wide average implying that the radiation hazard is insignificant. The data presented in this study would also be very useful to determine the possible future effects of the nuclear power plant to the environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Spatial distribution of gamma radioactivity levels and radiological hazard indices in the East Coastal sediments of Tamilnadu, India with statistical approach	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Beach sediments; Gamma ray spectrometry; Radiological hazards; Multivariate statistical analysis	NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; BUILDING-MATERIALS; SOIL SAMPLES; BEACH SANDS; EGYPT; RADIATION; TURKEY; RADIONUCLIDES; NIGERIA; MARINE	Natural and artificial radionuclide pollutants of the marine environment have been recognized as a serious environmental concern. The natural radioactivity levels in beach sediment samples collected from Thazhankuda (Cuddalore) to Kodiyakkarai along East Coast of Tamilnadu have been determined. Sediment sample were collected by a Peterson grab sampler from 10 m water depths parallel to the shore line. The grab sampler collects 10 cm thick bottom sediment layer from the seabed along the 20 stations. The radioactivities of 20 samples have been measured with a NaI(Tl) detector. The average specific activities for U-238, Th-232, and K-40 were found to be 3.67, 37.23 and 387.17 Bq kg(-1) respectively. The results have been compared with other radioactivity measurements in different countries. It shows that the average activity of U-238 and K-40 is lower whereas Th-232 is slightly greater than the compared worldwide average value. The radiation hazard due to the total natural radioactivity in the study area was estimated by different approaches such as the radium equivalent activity (Ra-eq), absorbed dose rate (D-R), hazard indices, the annual gonadal dose equivalent (AGDE) and annual effective dose equivalent (AEDE) are compared with the international recommended values. Multivariate Statistical analyses (Pearson Correlation, Cluster and Factor analysis) were carried out between the parameters obtained from the radioactivity to know the existing relations and to study the spatial distribution of radionuclide.

Thermoluminiscent dosimeters (Model TLD-100 H) were used to estimate the effective doses for 40 family members of fifteen patients treated with I-131. The family members wore a TLD in front of the chest for 10 days. The effective dose ranged from 0.23 to 6.74 mSv (mean 1.75 mSv). These findings may be considered when establishing new national guidelines concerning radiation protection and release of patients after a treatment with radioiodine therapy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To evaluate the stability of the adsorbent, the adsorption data at different temperatures (298-323 K) and gamma-ray absorbed doses (10-200 kGy) were analyzed by the Langmuir isotherm. The minimum adsorbed amount was calculated to be 0.121 mmol g(-1) at 323 K, approximately 23% reduction compared to 298 K. The maximum adsorbed amount of not-irradiated adsorbent with 0.156 mmol g(-1) decreased by 20% than that irradiated in 0.5 M HNO3. The thermodynamic parameters have revealed that this adsorption reaction is an exothermic and spontaneous process. The reduction in 3 M HNO3 was about 45% by the comparison between the before- and after-irradiation. It was found that both the concentrations of HNO3 and DBS have significant influence on the degradation of the adsorbents. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The external gamma dose rate (GDR), measured using two portable survey meters, was 151 nGy h(-1). The activity concentrations of Th-232, Ra-226, and 40K were determined using hyper pure germanium (HPGe) detector. The activity concentrations were varied from 11 +/- 1 to 583 +/- 18 Bq kg(-1) for 232Th, 6 +/- 1 to 244 +/- 9 Bq kg(-1) for Ra-226, and 13 +/- 6 to 830 +/- 13 Bq kg(-1) for K-40. Various types of water samples were analyzed using a Low Background Alpha Beta Series 5 XLB instrument at Nuclear Malaysia (NM). Gross alpha activity concentrations in tap water varied from 3 +/- 1 mBq L-1 to 34 +/- 6 mBq L-1 and gross beta activity concentrations varied from 58 +/- 5 mBq L-1 to 709 +/- 39 mBq L-1 which were lower than the recommended value by Interim National Water Quality Standards for Malaysia (INWQS) and World Health Organization (WHO, 1993).

For reliable use of energy-resolved photon-counting detectors (ERPCDs), energy calibration is an essential procedure prior to their use because variations in responses horn each pixel of the ERPCD for incident photons, even at the same energy, are inevitable. Energy calibration can be performed using a variety of methods. In all of these methods, the photon spectra with well-defined peak energies are recorded. Every pixel should be calibrated on its own. In this study, we suggest the use of a conventional polychromatic x-ray source (that is typically used in laboratories) for energy calibration. The energy calibration procedure mainly includes the determination of the peak energies in the spectra, flood-field irradiation, determination of peak channels, and determination of calibration curves (i.e., the slopes and intercepts of linear polynomials). We applied a calibration algorithm to a CdTe ERPCD comprised of 128 x 128 pixels with a pitch of 0.35 mm using highly attenuated polychromatic x-ray beams to reduce the pulse pile-up effect, and to obtain a narrow-shaped spectrum due to beam hardening. The averaged relative error in calibration curves obtained from 16,384 pixels was about 0.56% for 59.6 key photons from an Americium radioisotope. This pixel-by-pixel energy calibration enhanced the signal-and contrast-to-noise ratios in images, respectively, by a factor of 5 and 3 due to improvement in image homogeneity, compared to those obtained without energy calibration. One secondary finding of this study was that the x-ray photon spectra obtained using a common algorithm for computing x-ray spectra reasonably described the peaks in the measured spectra, which implies easier peak detection without the direct measurement of spectra using a separate spectrometer. The proposed method will be a useful alternative to conventional approaches using radioisotopes, a synchrotron, or specialized x-ray sources (e.g., characteristic or fluorescent x-rays) by reducing concerns over the beam flux, the irradiation field of view, accessibility, and cost.

Their energy resolution was first determined for similar to 5.5 MeV alpha particles from a radioactive sources, and values of full width half maximum (FWHM) of 22 keV and 33 keV were achieved using a shaping time constant of tau = 2.0 ns. Additional tests were performed using backscattered He-4 particles from the 2.0 MeV beam of a Van de Graaff accelerator. While the 22 keV FWHM detector failed after exposure to less than 5 x 10(6) cm(-2) He-4 particles, the other did not show any noticeable deterioration due to radiation damage for a fluence of 4 x 10(8) cm(2). For this type of PSD position resolution (tau = 0.5 mu s) standard deviations of Delta L = 0072 mm at similar to 5.5 MeV and Delta L = 0247 mm at 1.1 MeV were achieved. RES/Channeling experiments using PSD were performed on several crystalline samples, showing that this setup seems suitable for lattice location studies, particularly for heavy ions implantation (D greater than or similar to 10(15) at/cm(2)) on light substrates like Si, SiC, and AIN.

Here, we have characterised the blending of poly (ether sulfone) (PES) and poly (ethylene naphthalate) (PEN), which have dissimilar repeat units. The blended substrate is a faint-amber-coloured resin, and its density is between that of PES and PEN (1.34 g/cm(3)). Its excitation spectrum has a maximum at 370 nm and differs from the component substrates. However, the emission spectrum is similar to that for PEN substrates, and does not exhibit short-wavelength light from the PES component, even when excited by the excitation maximum of PES. These results reveal that excitation energy is being transferred to a lower energy level before it is emitted as light, with a maximum at 420 nm. By taking into account its emission spectrum, an effective refractive index was determined to be 1.70. Light yield distributions generated by Cs-137 and Bi-207 radioactive sources indicated that the blended substrate had a yield 223 times that of PES, and 0.68 Limes that of PEN. Overall, the results demonstrate that polymer blends can have scintillation characteristics that differ in some ways from those of the base substrates, with a potential advantage in being able to control them.

A time projection chamber for high accuracy and precision fission cross-section measurements	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						TPC; Detectors; Fission; Time Projection Chamber	NEUTRON-INDUCED FISSION; ENERGY-RANGE; NUCLEAR-DATA; MICROMEGAS; DETECTOR; U-235; URANIUM-235; SCATTERING; PU-242; FILMS	The fission Time Projection Chamber (fissionTPC) is a compact (15 cm diameter) two-chamber MICROMEGAS TPC designed to make precision cross-section measurements of neutron-induced fission. The actinide targets are placed on the central cathode and irradiated with a neutron beam that passes axially through the TPC inducing fission in the target. The 4 pi acceptance for fission fragments and complete charged particle track reconstruction are powerful features of the fissionTPC which will be used to measure fission cross-sections and examine the associated systematic errors. This paper provides a detailed description of the design requirements, the design solutions, and the initial performance of the fissionTPC. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A high-resolution multi-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrograph for precision mass measurements at RIKEN/SLOWRI	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						MRTOF-MS; Mass spectroscopy; Atomic mass	ELECTROSTATIC ION-TRAP; SHORT-LIVED NUCLEI; STORED IONS; R-PROCESS; SPECTROMETER; ELEMENTS; BEAMS; SEPARATORS; STORAGE; COOLER	A multi-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrograph (MRTOF-MS) has been implemented at RIKEN to provide high-precision mass measurements of very short-lived nuclei with half-lives down to <= 10 ms. Such measurements are of particular interest for r-process nuclei and trans-Uranium nuclei. We provide a detailed description of the mechanical construction and electronics implementation of an MRTOF-MS at RIKEN. The resolving power is investigated by numerical simulation and these simulations are compared to experimental observations to understand the effects of voltage and thermal instabilities. The limits of precision and accuracy are investigated using offline ion sources, and the effects of non-isobaric contaminants are reported. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

According to Caputo formalism of fractional calculus, the reduction process of beta-ray intensity is governed by using a simple fractional differential equation of order alpha approximate to 0.31. The solution is obtained in terms of Mittag-Leffler function which depends on a mass attenuation coefficient mu(m) and a fractional order a that can be considered as a measure of fractality of absorbing material. In the experimental part of the study, Tc-99, Cl-36, C-14, (210)pb and Pm-147 a Pm radioisotopes have been used as beta sources. In the framework of fractional calculus approach, the experimental and calculated half-value thicknesses of all samples have been obtained in agreement with each other. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Measurement of the response time of the delay window for the neutron converter of the SPIRAL2 project	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Neutron sources; Nuclear reaction; Radioactive ion beams; Targets		Research and development of a safety system for the SPIRAL2 facility has been conceived to protect the UCx target from a possible interaction with the 200 kW deuteron beam. The system called "delay window" (DW) is designed as an integral part of the neutron converter module and is located in between the neutron converter and the fission target. The device has been designed as a barrier, located directly behind the neutron converter on the axis of the deuteron beam, with the purpose of "delaying" the eventual interaction of the deuteron beam with the UCx target in case of a failure of the neutron converter. The "delay" must be long enough to allow the interlock to react and safely stop the beam operation, before the beam will reach the UCx target. The working concept of the DW is based on the principle of the electrical fuse. Electrically insulated wires placed on the surface of a Tantalum disk assure a so called "free contact", normally closed to an electronic circuit located on the HV platform, far from the radioactive environment. The melting temperature of the wires is much less than Tantalum. Once the beam is impinging on the disk, one or more wires are melted and the "free contact" is open. A solid state relay is changing its state and a signal is sent to the interlock device. A prototype of the DW has been constructed and tested with an electron beam of power density equivalent to the SPIRAL2 beam. The measured "delay" is 682.5 ms (sigma=116 ms), that is rather long in comparison to the intrinsic delays introduced by [he detectors itself (2 ms) and by the associated electronic devices (120 ns). The experimental results confirm [hat, in the case of a failure of the neutron converter, the DW as conceived is enable to withstand the beam power for a period of time sufficiently long to safely shut down the SPIRAL2 accelerator.

Accordingly, various mole ratios Al-FeOOH were synthesized and characterized by XRD, FT-IR, TEM, specific surface area and potentiometric acid-base titration. According to XRD and TEM images, the morphology of Al-FeOOH was transformed from acicular-like goethite to cotton-like gibbsite with increasing Al content. The adsorption and sequential desorption of U(VI) on Al-FeOOHs were conducted by batch techniques under N-2 conditions. The batch adsorption results showed that the adsorption of U(VI) on Al-FeOOHs slightly increased at pH < 4.0, then the significant increase of U(VI) adsorption was observed at pH from 4.0 to 7.0, whereas the suppressed adsorption at pH > 8.0 was due to the electrostatic repulsion between negative charge surface and negative carbonato-complexes. The adsorption of U(VI) on Al-FeOOHs was independent of ionic strength at pH > 5.0, indicating that the inner-sphere surface complexation predominated their adsorption behaviors, whereas U(VI) adsorption on Al-FeOOH could be the outer-sphere surface/cation exchange reaction. The sequential extraction texts showed that the desorption of U(VI) from Al-FeOOHs decreased with increasing Al content. These findings highlighted the effect of Al content on the sequestration and immobilization of U(VI) onto Al-FeOOHs from (sub)-surface environments in pollution management.

The emission spectrum of the waste glass being very complex, detailed study was done for proper choice of the emission lines. Investigations were carried out to optimize the experimental parameters like laser energy and acquisition delay time for the analysis. Calibration curves were obtained for two emission lines of U in these glasses. Effect of Ar atmosphere was also studied and the signal intensity was found to be similar to 5 times higher than in air atmosphere The emission lines used for normalization with vast difference in the upper energy level compared to the line of interest were found to give poor precision in air. In the Ar atmosphere, this effect was found to be much less significant and such emission lines can be used as an internal standard to achieve precise calibration curves. LIBS approach will be useful for real time determination of U in such samples, eliminating quantitative dissolution step required in many other analytical techniques like solution based ICP-MS/OES.

J	Kandwal, P; Mohapatra, PK				Kandwal, Pankaj; Mohapatra, Prasanta Kumar			Evaluation of a novel and efficient solvent system containing chlorinated cobalt dicarbollide for radio-cesium recovery from acidic wastes	RADIOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Cobalt dicarbollide; Cesium; Strontium; Solvent extraction; Radioactive waste	EXTRACTION UNEX PROCESS; FUNDAMENTAL CHEMISTRY; CESIUM; STRONTIUM; SEPARATION; NITROBENZENE; DERIVATIVES; CARBORANE; ACTINIDES; ANALOGS	A novel solvent system containing chlorinated cobalt dicarbollide (CCD) in a diluent mixture containing 2-nitrophenyloctyl ether (NPOE) and n-dodecane was found to be highly efficient for the extraction of radio-cesium from acidic feed conditions. When PEG-400 (polyethylene glycol with average molecular weight of 400) was added to the solvent system, it was found to extract radio-strontium as well similar to that reported with the UNEX (Universal Extractant) solvent. The solvent system was found to be superior as compared to analogous solvent systems reported previously using CCD in either nitrobenzene or PTMS (phenyltrifluoromethyl sulphone, a fluorinated diluent). The present work deals with less toxic solvent formulation which can be used as an alternative to these hazardous/toxic chemicals for simultaneous recovery of Cs(I) and Sr(II) from acidic solutions. Batch cocurrent extraction data are also presented for the simultaneous recovery of Cs and Sr which indicated near quantitative extraction (>99.5%) of the metal ions in 4 and 3 stages, respectively. The reusability and radiolytic stability studies were also carried out which suggested highly encouraging results.

Mannose triflate and cysteamine molecules (MTC) were also utilized to prepare MTC-QDs and MTC-QDs-Lec probes as well as Lec bound QDs. Afterwards; potential use of these nanoparticles as radiolabeled fluorescence nano-probes for the cell imaging studies has been investigated. Biological activities of I-125(-), I-125-MTC-QDs, MTC-QDs- Lec-I-125, QDs-Lec-I-125 and Lec-I-125 were examined on various cancer cell lines such as Caco-2, MCF-7 and A-549 in terms of cell incorporation. QDs-Lec-I-125 exhibited the highest cell incorporation on whole cell lines. In addition, the QDs-Lec-I-131, was used for in vivo imaging. The whole body distribution of the radiolabeled QDs on New Zealand rabbits and Balb C mice were examined by taking dynamic and static images.

Evaluation of the Reduction in the Separative Power of the Steps in a Cascade of gas Centrifuges	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								The particularities of the reduction in the separative power of centrifuges in time owing to the appearance of defects and changes in the state parameters are examined. A method of evaluating the losses of separative power of the steps in a cascade by measuring the parameters of the centrifuges, described by a continuous distribution, is developed. The basic models of the change in the distributions are determined on the basis of Markov diffusion processes. Examples of the evaluation of the losses of separative power are presented for typical distributions of the correlating parameters.

Comparison of the Circulation Efficiency in gas Centrifuges with Different Geometric and Speed Characteristics for Uranium Enrichment	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article							FLOW	The circulation efficiency of gas centrifuges for uranium enrichment is compared for domestically produced gas centrifuges, the TC-12 and TC-21 models from the European concern Urenco, the American AC-100 model, and the Iguasu model centrifuge in order to search for general physical mechanisms. It is found that for the domestic centrifuges the optimal gas pressure P (a) near the wall of the rotor is a linear function of the optimal temperature difference Delta T along the rotor. It is shown that the degree of optimality of the circulation flow in a gas centrifuge ha a maximum as a function of the dimensionless rotational speed of the rotor, which is associated with the difficulties of organizing the optimal circulation flow in a thin layer of viscous gas at the rotor wall at high rotational speeds.

Comparison between in situ and ex situ gamma measurements on land areas within a decommissioning nuclear site: a case study at Dounreay	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article						soil sampling; radioactively contaminated land; in situ measurements; measurement uncertainty	MEASUREMENT UNCERTAINTY; CONTAMINATED LAND; CS-137 INVENTORIES; SOIL; DETECTOR; COST	Measurements made in situ with gamma detectors and ex situ measurements of soil samples in a laboratory can have complementary roles in the assessment of radioactively contaminated land on decommissioning nuclear sites. Both in situ and ex situ methods were used to characterize Cs-137 contamination within an area at the Dounreay site in Scotland. The systematic difference (bias) between estimates of the mean activity concentration was found to be non-significant when in situ measurements were interpreted using a linear depth model, based on ex situ measurements made at two different depths. An established method of evaluating the random components of measurement uncertainty was used. The random component of analytical uncertainty in the in situ measurements, made in field conditions, was found to exceed that for the ex situ measurements, made in the controlled conditions of a laboratory. However, contamination by the target radionuclide was found to be heterogeneous over small spatial scales. This resulted in significantly higher levels of random sampling uncertainty in individual ex situ measurements. As in situ measurements are substantially less costly, a greater number of measurements can be made, which potentially reduces the uncertainty on the mean. Providing the depth profile of contaminants can be modelled with confidence, this can enable estimates of mean activity concentration over an averaging area to be made with lower overall uncertainties than are possible using ex situ methods.

J	Perez-Sanchez, D; Thorne, MC				Perez-Sanchez, D.; Thorne, M. C.			An investigation into the upward transport of uranium-series radionuclides in soils and uptake by plants	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article						U-238 decay chain; transport in soil; plant uptake; hydrology; sensitivity study	SEASONAL-VARIATIONS; BEHAVIOR; HYDROLOGY; ACCOUNT; MODEL; AREA	The upward migration of radionuclides in the U-238 decay series in soils and their uptake by plants is of interest in various contexts, including the geological disposal of radioactive waste and the remediation of former sites of uranium mining and milling. In order to investigate the likely patterns of behaviour of U-238-series radionuclides being transported upward through the soil column, a detailed soil-plant model originally developed for studying the behaviour of Se-79 in soil-plant systems has been adapted to make it applicable to the U-238 series. By undertaking a reference case simulation and a series of sensitivity studies, it has been found that a wide variety of behaviour can be exhibited by radionuclides in the U-238 decay chain in soils, even when the source term is limited to being a constant flux of either U-238 or Ra-226. Hydrological conditions are a primary factor, both in respect of the overall advective flow deeper in the soil, which controls the rate of upward migration, and in the influence of seasonally changing flow directions closer to the soil surface, which can result in the accumulation of radionuclides at specific depths irrespective of changes in sorption between the oxic and anoxic regions of the soil. However, such changes in sorption can also be significant in controlling the degree of accumulation that occurs. This importance of seasonally varying factors in controlling radionuclide transport in soils even in very long-term simulations is a strong argument against the use of annually averaged parameters in long-term assessment models. With a water table that was simulated to fluctuate seasonally from a substantial depth in soil to the surface soil layer, the timing of such variations in relation to the period of plant growth was found to have a major impact on the degree of uptake of radionuclides by plant roots. In long-term safety assessment studies it has sometimes been the practice to model the transport of Ra-226 in soil, but to assume that both Pb-210 and Po-210 can be treated as being present in secular equilibrium with the Ra-226. This simplification is not always appropriate. Where geochemical conditions are such that the Ra-226 migrates upward in the soil column faster than Pb-210 and Po-210, disequilibrium is not a significant issue, as the Ra-226 supports Pb-210 and Po-210 at concentrations somewhat below those estimated on the basis of assumed secular equilibrium. However, for low, but realistic, values of the distribution coefficients for Pb-210 and Po-210 and high, but realistic, distribution coefficients for Ra-226, the Pb-210 and Po-210 can reach the surface soil in high concentrations that are not locally supported by Ra-226. This means that models based on the assumption of secular equilibrium should not be employed without a careful consideration of the hydrological and hydrochemical situation of interest.

Remediation of TENORM residues: risk communication in practice	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article						naturally occurring radioactive materials; risk communication; regulations	PERCEPTION; UNCERTAINTY; CRISIS	Despite several decades of studies on the risk assessment and risk perception of ionising radiation, risk management of radioactive materials remains a challenging issue. This is also true for wastes containing technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials. The present work focuses on the underlying reasons for communication problems between experts and affected members of the public. Exploring the case of a German remediation site with residual radioactive contamination in a residential area, the experts' as well as the residents' perspectives were studied by conducting qualitative interviews. Our results indicate a variety of reasons for communication problems on different levels of risk management and risk communication: the regulatory, the communicative and the moral levels. In the observed case, four salient causes for problems in risk communication and risk management emerged: the mismatch in understanding the residents' values, the issue of risk communication in an unforeseen situation, the problem of the regulatory gap between radiation protection and soil protection in regard to legacies with naturally occurring radioactive material in Germany, and the challenge of communicating a highly complex scientific issue to non-scientists. Moreover, one (at least partial) solution could be seen: the introduction of an external mediator. The results indicate that coordination of different health and environment protection disciplines-in this case radiation protection relating to soil protection-is possible and urgently needed. The opportunity to put, at least natural, radioactive material in line with other conventional industrial materials should be taken.

J	Puncher, M				Puncher, M.			An assessment of the reliability of dose coefficients for intakes of radionuclides by members of the public	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article						internal emitters; effective dose coefficients; uncertainty analysis	RESPIRATORY-TRACT MODEL; INTERNAL DOSIMETRY; BIOKINETIC MODEL; CONVERSION FACTOR; PARTICLE-SIZE; UNCERTAINTIES; INGESTION; INHALATION; PLUTONIUM; I-131	This paper summarises work undertaken on behalf of the Environment Agency for England to quantify uncertainties resulting from internal exposures to a number of radionuclides considered significant because of their anthropogenic origin, namely: U-238, Ra-226, Pu-239, Am-241, Cs-137, Sr-90, I-131, I-129 and H-3. Uncertainties in the biokinetic models that are used to calculate the retention and excretion of radionuclides are derived in order to calculate distributions of effective dose per unit intake following their inhalation or ingestion by members of the UK public. The central values and ranges of the distributions are used to inform the derivation of uncertainty factors (UFs) for the different dose coefficients, which can be used to assess reliability. These represent uncertainties inherent in the structures of the biokinetic models and their parameter values. The inferred UF values are typically around 2-3 for ingestion and 2-6 for inhalation for all age groups, and are comparable to UF values inferred from published studies. It is instructive to consider these ranges alongside the likely levels of exposure that are expected from the radionuclides considered (the microsievert range) and the dose limit of planned exposures for members of the public (1000 mu Sv).

Misho Project	Comprehensive data on ionising radiation from Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in the town of Miharu, Fukushima prefecture: The Misho Project	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article						Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant; Misho Project; OSL docimetry; iodine tablets; Cs-134; Cs-136; Cs-137; I-131; Te-132; radiation survey; radioactivity ratios	ACCIDENT; CONTAMINATION	Data related to radioactivity released from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident on 15 March 2011 gathered by residents of Miharu, Fukushima Prefecture, and by Tohoku University are presented. These data sets consist of (1) the earliest radiation monitoring by a Geiger counter in the town, (2) ratios of radioactivity between Te-132 and Cs-137 for a wide area between Fukushima and Tokyo, (3) radiation measurement of soil samples collected from 18 school grounds, and (4) external radiation exposure of 1400 students using OSL badges. By combining and analysing these various data sets, a curve for the cumulative total external exposure as a function of time, with 16 : 00 h on 15 March 2011 being time zero, is obtained. The average cumulative external dosage is estimated to be 10 mSv (sigma = 4.2 mSv) over 10 years. In addition, the initiative that the residents of Miharu took in response to the FDNPP accident, which became known as The Misho Project (MP), is documented; in particular, the time at which the municipality instructed the immediate ingestion of iodine tablets by those under the age of 40, 13 : 00 h on 15 March 2011, is assessed.

Design of patient rooms and automatic radioiodine-131 waste water management system for a thyroid cancer treatment ward: 'Suandok model'	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article						I-131 patient's room; I-131 waste water; differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC)		The great benefit of I-131 radionuclide treatment for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) was acknowledged by the long survival rate. The main requirements for I-131 therapy in hospital were treatment facilities and a radiation safety plan that assured radiation protection and safety to patient, hospital worker, public, and environment. Objective: To introduce the concepts and methods of radiation safety design for a patient's room in a I-131 treatment ward and a system of radioactive waste water management in hospital. Methods: The design was based on principles of external and internal radiation protection for unsealed source and radioactive waste management. Planning for treatment facilities was concluded from clinical evidence, physical and physiological information for I-131, radiation safety criteria, hospital resources and budget. The three phases of the working process were: construction, software development, and radiation safety assessment. Results: The I-131 treatment facility and automatic radioactive waste water management system was completely implemented in 2009. The radiation waste water management system known as the 'Suandok Model' was highly recommended by the national regulator to hospitals who desire to provide I-131 treatment for thyroid cancer. In 2011, the Nuclear Medicine Division, Chiang Mai University was rewarded by the national authority for a very good radiation practice in development of safe working conditions and environment. Conclusion: The Suandok Model was a facility design that fulfilled requirements for the safe use of high radiation I-131 doses for thyroid cancer treatment in hospital. The facility presented in this study may not be suitable for all hospitals but the design concepts could be applied according to an individual hospital context and resources. People who use or gain benefit from radiation applications have to emphasise the responsibility to control and monitor radiation effects on individuals, communities and the environment.

J	Axelsson, A; Ringbom, A				Axelsson, A.; Ringbom, A.			On the calculation of activity concentrations and nuclide ratios from measurements of atmospheric radioactivity	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Atmospheric radioactivity; Radioxenon; Nuclide ratios; CTBT	TEST-BAN-TREATY; NUCLEAR EVENT; XENON; SYSTEM; RADIONUCLIDES; RADIOXENON	Motivated by the need for consistent use of concepts central to the reporting of results from measurements of atmospheric radioactivity, we discuss some properties of the methods commonly used. Different expressions for decay correction of the activity concentration for parent-daughter decay pairs are presented, and it is suggested that this correction should be performed assuming parent-daughter ingrowth in the sample during the entire measurement process. We note that, as has already been suggested by others, activities rather than activity concentrations should be used when nuclide ratios are calculated. In addition, expressions that can be used to transform activity concentrations to activity ratios are presented. Finally we note that statistical uncertainties for nuclide ratios can be properly calculated using the exact solution to the problem of confidence intervals for a ratio of two jointly normally distributed variables, the so-called Fieller's theorem.

Preliminary results on a new method for producing yttrium phosphorous microspheres	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Seed source; Radioactive microspheres; Brachytherapy sources	IN-SITU RADIOTHERAPY; DEEP-SEATED CANCER; CHEMICAL DURABILITY; ION-IMPLANTATION; GLASS MICROSPHERES; PHOSPHATE; RADIATION; FTIR; THERAPY	This paper reports on a new method to embed phosphorus particles into the matrix of yttrium aluminum silicate microspheres. Yttrium phosphorus glass microspheres about 20 gm in size were obtained when an aqueous solution of YCl3 and AlCl3 were added to tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) (phosphoric acid was used to catalyze the hydrolysis and condensation of TEOS) and was pumped into silicone oil under constant stirring. The shapes of the particles produced by this method are regular and nearly spheric in shape. Paper chromatography was used to determine the radiochemical impurity of radioactive microspheres. Radionuclide purity was determined using a gamma spectrometry system and an ultra-low level liquid scintillation spectrometer. The P+ ions implantation stage was eliminated by embedding phosphorus particles in the matrix of the glass microspheres. This paper shows that a high temperature is not required to produce yttrium phosphorus aluminum silicate microspheres. The result shows that the silicone oil spheroidization method is a very suitable way to produce yttrium phosphorus glass microspheres. The topographical analysis of microspheres shows that the Y, P, Si, and Al elements are distributed in the microspheres and the distribution of elements in the samples is homogenous.

In order to determine the two parameters, the pure diffusion migration equation for radon was firstly established and its analytic solution with the two parameters to be determined was derived. Then, a self manufactured experimental column was used to simulate the pure diffusion of the radon, the improved scintillation cell method was used to measure the pore radon concentrations at different depths of the column loaded with the fragmented uranium ore, and the nonlinear least square algorithm was used to inversely determine the radon diffusion coefficient and the free radon production rate. Finally, the solution with the two inversely determined parameters was used to predict the pore radon concentrations at some depths of the column, and the predicted results were compared with the measured results. The results show that the predicted results are in good agreement with the measured results and the numerical inverse method is applicable to the determination of the radon diffusion coefficient and the free radon production rate for the fragmented uranium ore.

Pulverized RPL glass particles were encapsulated into hundreds of polystyrene balls of accumulation-type RPL detectors. The RPL detectors were placed near an intense gamma-ray source. After irradiation, the RPL detectors were uniformly brightened with a UV illuminator. Orange RPL could be observed by the naked eye at doses above 5 Gy. For a dose above 0.5 Gy, a clear RPL photograph was taken with a digital camera. The spatial dose distribution was obtained through digital image processing of the RPL photograph. Therefore, this simple RPL photographing technique using RPL detectors is useful for detecting high levels of radioactivity. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ARGO-YBJ Collaboration	Radon contribution to single particle counts of the ARGO-YBJ detector	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS			English	Article						Low energy cosmic instrumentation; Extensive air shower; Radon; Natural radioactivity	RESISTIVE PLATE CHAMBER; SCALER MODE; NEUTRONS	The ARGO-YBJ experiment is an air shower detector for gamma ray astronomy and cosmic ray studies with an energy threshold of similar to 500 GeV. Working in "single particle mode", i.e. counting the single particles hitting the detector at fixed time intervals, ARGO-YBJ can monitor cosmic ray and gamma ray transients at energies of a few GeV. The single particle counting rate is modulated by the atmospheric pressure and temperature, and is affected by the local radioactivity from soil and air. Among the radioactive elements, radon gas is of particular importance since its concentration in air can vary significantly, according to environmental conditions. In this paper we evaluate the contribution of the radon daughter gamma ray emitters to the single particle counting rate measured by ARGO-YBJ. According to our analysis, the radon gas contribution is roughly 1-2%, producing a counting rate modulation of the same order of magnitude of the atmospheric effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the concentrations of Pb-210 and Po-210 in the 10 most widely sold cigarette brands in Italy during the year 2010 were measured, and the effective dose to smokers has been calculated. The results of this study show that Pb-210 concentration ranged from 11.6 to 20.0 mBq cig(-1) with an arithmetic mean of 14.6 mBq cig(-1), while the activity concentration of Po-210 ranged from 13.1 to 19.0 mBq cig(-1) with an arithmetic mean of 15.7 mBq cig(-1), thus confirming previous results and showing that the radioactivity concentration was not reduced in the last few years. The annual effective dose for a typical smoker consuming 20 cigarettes per day ranged from an average of 55 mu Sv y(-1) to about 81 mu Sv y(-1). It is finally put in evidence the need to improve the knowledge about crucial data needed for accurate dose assessment deriving from the inhalation of both radioisotopes contained in the cigarettes, namely the dose conversion coefficients, which strongly depend on several parameters such as the inhalation speed through the mouth, the real fraction of radionuclide transferred from cigarette to mainstream smoke, the lung absorption behavior of the radioisotopes inhaled with mainstream smoke, and the AMAD of particles inhaled by smokers.

A portion of this area will be evacuated; however, people living in the portion that is not evacuated yet is still contaminated with low-levels of radioactive contamination will be asking for ways they can reduce their exposure. Whether cleaning activities can significantly reduce exposure is not fully understood. In this effort, the ability of cleaning activities to remove cesium (Cs-137) was studied. The removal efficacy of cleaning with a commercial product, Simple Green (R), was compared to cleaning with water for hard surfaces typically seen in residences. The removal efficacy of laundering fabric material surfaces was also determined for a range of conditions (e.g., fabric material type, wash temperature). During these studies, assessments of the implications of these activities (e.g., cross-contamination, resulting waste streams) were also completed. Simple Green (R) and water were effective for removing Cs-137 from plastic laminate and vinyl flooring (93.4-96.8%) but were not effective for removing Cs-137 from painted wallboard and wood (7.3-68.1%). It was also determined that there was no significant difference between the two cleaners on all of the surfaces, except plastic laminate, for which Simple Green (R) was slightly more effective. Laundering was effective for removing Cs-137 contamination from polyester and cotton swatches and cotton comforters (up to 96.8% in the single swatch testing).

The basis of the SMR licensing process development lies in licensing processes used in Finland, France, the UK, Canada and the USA. These countries have been selected for this study because of their various licensing processes and recent actions in the new NPP construction. Certain aspects of the aviation industry licensing process have also been studied and selected practices have been investigated as possibly suitable for use in nuclear licensing. Suitable features for SMR licensing are emphasized and suggested. The licensing features of the spent nuclear fuel deep repository along with similar features of SMR licensing are discussed. Since there are similar types of challenges of lengthy licensing time frames, as well as modular features to be taken into account in licensing, these two different nuclear industry fields can be compared. The main SMR features to take into account in licensing are: Standardization of the design. Modularity. Mass production. Serial construction. Modularity can be divided into two different categories: the first category is simply a single power plant unit constructed of independently engineered modules (e.g. construction process for Westinghouse AP-1000 NPP) and the second one a power plant composed of many reactor modules, which are manufactured in factories and installed as needed (e.g. NuScale Power SMR design). The deep underground repository for spent nuclear fuel, such as the one planned to be built to Olkiluoto, Finland, is based on modular design and phased construction. In this case the disposal tunnels, bentonite buffer and backfill and the disposal canisters can be considered as modules. Due to its phased construction the facility has similar licensing characteristics of SMRs. A common licensing process needs to be simple and clear to ensure the feasibility of construction and deployment of SMR's as well as the deep geological repositories. One of the important aspects of nuclear licensing is the compliance to licensing requirements. In a discrete and transparent matter, systems engineering (SE) and requirements engineering (RE) are discussed with the licensing development. The sheer number of licensing requirements is daunting, interconnected in a complex fashion and long-lasting. The process and tools play a critical role in the success of the licensing effort. A few proposed examples of combined SMR and deep repository licensing applications are discussed using SE and RE principles. A synergistic discussion on licensing models, nuclear licensing simplification, as well as international approach in licensing, will be needed in the future. This would be a natural continuation to the collaborative efforts in Europe underway for existing and new large reactors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Miletic, M; Fukac, R; Pioro, I; Dragunov, A				Miletic, Marija; Fukac, Rostislav; Pioro, Igor; Dragunov, Alexey			Development of gas cooled reactors and experimental setup of high temperature helium loop for in-pile operation	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								Rapidly increasing energy and electricity demands, global concerns over the climate changes and strong dependence on foreign fossil fuel supplies are powerfully influencing greater use of nuclear power. In order to establish the viability of next-generation reactor concepts to meet tomorrow's needs for clean and reliable energy production the fundamental research and development issues need to be addressed for the Generation-IV nuclear-energy systems. Generation-IV reactor concepts are being developed to use more advanced materials, coolants and higher burn-ups fuels, while keeping a nuclear reactor safe and reliable. One of the six Generation-IV concepts is a very high temperature reactor (VHTR). The VHTR concept uses a graphite-moderated core with a once-through uranium fuel cycle, using high temperature helium as the coolant. Because helium is naturally inert and single-phase, the helium-cooled reactor can operate at much higher temperatures, leading to higher efficiency. Current VHTR concepts will use fuels such as uranium dioxide, uranium carbide, or uranium oxycarbide. Since some of these fuels are new in nuclear industry and due to their unknown properties and behavior within VHTR conditions it is very important to address these issues by investigate their characteristics within conditions close to those in VHTRs. This research can be performed in a research reactor with in-pile helium loop designed and constructed in Research Center Rez Ltd. One of the topics analyzed in this article are also physical characteristic and benefits of gas coolants. The purpose of the high temperature helium loop (HTHL) is to simulate technical and chemical conditions of VHTR's coolant. The loop is intended to serve an as experimental device for fatigue and creep tests of construction metallic materials for gas-cooled reactors and it should be also employed for research in field of gaseous coolant chemistry. The loop will serve also for tests of nuclear graphite, dosing and helium purification systems. Because the VHTR is a new reactor concept, major technical uncertainties remain relative to helium-cooled advanced reactor systems. This paper summarizes also the concept of the HTHL in the Research Centre Rez Ltd., its design, utilization and future plans for experimental setup. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
