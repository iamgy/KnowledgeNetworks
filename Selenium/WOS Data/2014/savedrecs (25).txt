Rapid separation and purification of uranium and plutonium from dilute-matrix samples	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Trace uranium; Trace plutonium; Environmental samples; Radiochemical separations; Safeguards	ACTINIDES; ISOTOPES; PU	This work describes a streamlined approach to the separation and purification of trace uranium and plutonium in environmental swipe samples that contain a small amount of collected bulk material. We describe key modifications to conventional techniques that result in a relatively rapid, safe, cost-effective, and efficient U and Pu separation process. Simulated samples were produced by loading appropriate U-235, U-238, and Pu-240 onto high purity cotton swipes. Uranium concentration and isotopic composition were measured by multi-collector inductively coupled mass spectrometry. Corresponding plutonium measurements were conducted with a three stage thermal ionization mass spectrometer. Quantitative U and Pu recoveries were observed with this method.

Assessment of Ra-226 and Ra-228 activity concentration in west coast of India	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Ra-226 and Ra-228; In-situ pre-concentration technique; West coast of India	MARINE-ENVIRONMENT; ARABIAN SEA; WATER; SPECTROMETRY; RADIUM; DISCHARGE; ISOTOPES	An investigation on the distribution of Ra-226 and Ra-228 activity concentration in coastal surface sea water from Okha in Gujarat to Ratnagiri in Maharashtra state along the west coast of India was carried out. In-situ pre-concentration technique was used to measure radium isotopes by passing 1,000 L of seawater through MnO2 impregnated polypropylene filter cartridges at all the locations. Ra-226 was estimated using gamma ray peak of its daughter radionuclides Bi-214 and Pb-214. Ra-228 was estimated from its daughter Ac-228. In the coastal waters, Ra-226 and Ra-228 activity concentration were observed to be in the range of 1.5-2.9 and 2.5-8.6 Bq m(-3) with a mean of 2.2 and 4.9 Bq m(-3) respectively. The activity of Ra-228 was observed to be more than Ra-226 in all the locations. The variation in spatial distribution of the radium isotopes activity concentration and its ratio with respect to location is discussed in the paper. The radioactive database obtained represents reference values for coastal environment of India.	[Sartandel, S. J.; Jha, S. K.; Bara, S. V.; Tripathi, R.

Radioactivity concentrations of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 in the studied samples range from 11.6 to 120.6, 10.2 to 107.1 and 228.0 to 1,036.2 Bq kg(-1), respectively. The concentrations for these natural radionuclides were compared with the reported data of other countries and the mean value for soil. Radium equivalent activity, indoor air absorbed dose rate, annual effective dose rate as well as external and internal hazard indices were calculated to assess radiological hazards for people living in dwelling made of the building materials. The radiological hazard assessment results show that the studied building materials, except for some aerated concrete block samples, are safe for use in construction of dwellings in the study area and do not pose any significant source of radiation hazard.

The authors hypothesized that valuable information could be obtained from gas proportional counter techniques by screening urine samples from potentially exposed individuals rapidly. Recommended gross alpha and beta activity screening methods generally employ gas proportional counting techniques. Based on International Standards Organization (ISO) methods, improvements were made in the evaporation process to develop a method to provide rapid results, adequate sensitivity, and minimum sample preparation and operator intervention for humans with internal radioactive contamination. The method described by an American National Standards Institute publication was used to calibrate the gas proportional counter, and urine samples from patients with or without radionuclide treatment were measured to validate the method. By improving the evaporation process, the time required to perform the assay was reduced dramatically. Compared with the reference data, the results of the validation samples were very satisfactory with respect to gross-alpha and gross-beta activities. The gas flow proportional counting method described here has the potential for radioactivity monitoring in the body. This method was easy, efficient, and fast, and its application is of great utility in determining whether a sample should be analyzed by a more complicated method, for example radiochemical and/or gamma-spectroscopy. In the future, it may be used commonly in medical examination and nuclear emergency treatment.

The authors analyzed images of plant leaves to investigate the regional radioactivity ecology resulting from the 2011 accident at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant, Japan. The present study is not an evaluation of the macro radiation dose per weight, which has been performed previously, but rather an image analysis of the radioactive dose per leaf, allowing the capture of various gradual changes in radioactive contamination as a function of elapsed time. In addition, the leaf analysis method has potential applications in the decontamination of food plants or other materials.

J	Saadi, Z				Saadi, Zakaria			On the Air-filled Effective Porosity Parameter of Rogers and Nielson's (1991) Bulk Radon Diffusion Coefficient in Unsaturated Soils	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						radon; modeling; diffusion; dose assessment; dose; health effects	URANIUM MILL TAILINGS; TRANSPORT; EXHALATION; PERMEABILITY; LIQUID; MODEL	The radon exhalation rate at the earth's surface from soil or rock with radium as its source is the main mechanism behind the radon activity concentrations observed in both indoor and outdoor environments. During the last two decades, many subsurface radon transport models have used Rogers and Nielson's formula for modeling the unsaturated soil bulk radon diffusion coefficient. This formula uses an "air-filled effective porosity" to account for radon adsorption and radon dissolution in the groundwater. This formula is reviewed here, and its hypotheses are examined for accuracy in dealing with subsurface radon transport problems. The author shows its limitations by comparing one dimensional steady-state analytical solutions of the two-phase (air/water) transport equation (Fick's law) with Rogers and Nielson's formula. For radon diffusion-dominated transport, the calculated Rogers and Nielson's radon exhalation rate is shown to be unrealistic as it is independent of the values of the radon adsorption and groundwater dissolution coefficients. For convective and diffusive transport, radon exhalation rates calculated using Fick's law and this formula agree only for high values of gas-phase velocity and groundwater saturation. However, these conditions are not usually met in most shallow subsurface environments where radon migration takes place under low gas phase velocities and low water saturation.

These systems may consist of probes, straight tubing, bends, contractions and other components. Evaluation of these systems for potential loss of radioactive aerosols is important because significant losses can occur. However, it can be very difficult to find fully described equations to model a system manually for a single particle size and even more difficult to evaluate total system efficiency for a polydispersed particle distribution. Some software methods are available, but they may not be directly applicable to the components being evaluated and they may not be completely documented or validated per current software quality assurance requirements. This paper offers a method to model radioactive aerosol transport in sampling systems that is transparent and easily updated with the most applicable models. Calculations are shown with the R Programming Language, but the method is adaptable to other scripting languages. The method has the advantage of transparency and easy verifiability. This paper shows how a set of equations from published aerosol science models may be applied to aspiration and transport efficiency of aerosols in common air sampling system components. An example application using R calculation scripts is demonstrated. The R scripts are provided as electronic attachments.

J	Krishnamoorthy, J; Salame-Alfie, A; O'Connell, J				Krishnamoorthy, Janaki; Salame-Alfie, Adela; O'Connell, John			An Analysis of Radiation Therapy Medical Events in New York State: The Role of the State Radiation Programs in Patient Safety	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topics; accelerators, medical; quality assurance; radiation therapy	ONCOLOGY; ERROR; DELIVERY; IMPACT	From 2001 through 2009, the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) has documented 244 reports of radiation therapy events, of which 228 have resulted from the delivery of radiation beam therapy using linear accelerators (LINACs). Historically, radiation therapy events involving LINACs have not been uniformly reported across the country because LINACs are regulated by state radiation control programs, and reporting requirements vary among states. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Nuclear Material Events Database (NMED) only tracks events involving radioactive materials (RAM). Efforts to track medical events involving LINACs at a national level have begun only recently. This article highlights the importance of tracking and analyzing all medical radiation events in order to improve quality of care and patient safety. An analysis of a subset of the data collected by the NYSDOH from 2001-2009 is presented. This subset consists of only events arising from the use of LINACs in radiation therapy. There are very few publications on errors and error rates in the use of medical accelerators in radiation therapy. This analysis highlights the most common types of errors, causes and contributing factors, areas for improvement and actions taken to bring this information to the regulated community. An error rate of 0.07% per patient receiving radiation treatment is estimated using these data and the New York State Tumor Registry data for the same period. NY State Regulations governing the practice of Radiation Oncology have been revised recently to reflect the increased complexity in the delivery of therapeutic radiation. Collaboration and sharing of data such as those presented here, between federal, state and local regulators, professional organizations such as the Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors (CRCPD), American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM), American College of Radiology (ACR), American College of Radiation Oncology (ACRO), manufacturers of medical radiation equipment and software developers and the regulated community has begun and will contribute to improved quality of care and patient safety.

Using analytical and Monte Carlo analysis, we show that dosimeters response has no angular dependence as claimed by a previous study. The dose rate formula we derived takes into account the path length of the photons in the dosimeter. Experimental data have been used to validate our analytical and Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, the effects on the dosimeters responses in relation to their sizes response of their size and geometry and orientation have been investigated and, within statistical errors, no angular dependence was found.

To optimize tritium analysis in waters by ultra-low background liquid scintillation spectrometer Quantulus 1220 the optimization of sample/scintillant ratio, choice of appropriate scintillation cocktail and comparison of their efficiency, background and minimal detectable activity (MDA), the effect of chemi- and photoluminescence and combination of scintillant/vial were performed. ASTM D4107-08 (2006) method had been successfully applied in our laboratory for two years. During our last preparation of samples a serious quench effect in count rates of samples that could be consequence of possible contamination by DMSO was noticed. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate development of new direct method in our laboratory proposed by Pujol and Sanchez-Cabeza (1999), which turned out to be faster and simpler than ASTM method while we are dealing with problem of neutralization of DMSO in apparatus. The minimum detectable activity achieved was 2.0 Bq l(-1) for a total counting time of 300 min.

Ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) is a widely used polymer and might be considered as a potential candidate radioactive waste encapsulation material. In this study, the dose rate distribution in the radioactive waste drum (containing radioactive waste and the polymer matrix) was determined using Monte Carlo simulations. The change in the dose rate within the waste drum with different amounts of lead filler was also simulated. It was seen that lead filler would decrease the dose delivered to the polymer by means of energy dissipation. Moreover, the change of mechanical properties of EPDM was estimated and their variation within the waste drum was determined for the duration of 15, 30 and 300 years after embedding.

A direct detection method of ionized alpha-emitters from the Rn-222 decay chain (Po-214 and Po-218) in a cryogenic liquid in the presence of an external electric field is shown. Properties of the radioactive ions are derived from a proposed model of ion production and transport in the cryogenic liquid. Ionic life-time of the ions was found to be on the order of 10 s in liquid nitrogen (4.0 purity class). The presence of positive and negative ions was observed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Sherwood, DJ; Saez, AE				Sherwood, David J.; Saez, A. Eduardo			The start of ebullition in quiescent, yield-stress fluids	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							BUBBLE-GROWTH; RHEOLOGY; DYNAMICS; MAGMA; FOAMS; MODEL; TRANSPORT; STABILITY; ERUPTIONS; VOLCANOS	Non-Newtonian rheology is typical for the high-level radioactive waste (HLW) slurries to be processed in the Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP). Hydrogen and other flammable gases are generated in the aqueous phase by radiolytic and chemical reactions. HLW slurries have a capacity for retaining gas characterized by the shear strength holding the bubbles still. The sizes and degassing characteristics of flammable gas bubbles in the HLW slurries, expected to be processed by the WTP are important considerations for designing equipment and operating procedures. Slurries become susceptible to degassing as the bubble concentration increases over a maximum value that depends on shear strength. This susceptibility and the process of ebullitive bubble enlargement are described here. When disturbed, the fluid undergoes localized flow around neighboring bubbles which are dragged together and coalesce, producing an enlarged bubble. For the conditions considered in this work, bubble size increase is enough to displace the weight required to overcome the fluid shear strength and yield the surroundings. The buoyant bubble ascends and accumulates others within a zone of influence, enlarging by a few orders of magnitude. This process describes how the first bubbles appear on the surface of a 7 Pa shear strength fluid a few seconds after being jarred. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Influence of fracture networks on radionuclide transport from solidified waste forms	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							POROUS-MEDIA; CONTAMINANT TRANSPORT; SINGLE FRACTURE; FLOW; PERMEABILITY; MECHANISMS; CONCRETE	Analysis of the effect of fractures in porous media on fluid flow and mass transport is of great interest in many fields including geotechnical, petroleum, hydrogeology and waste management. This paper presents sensitivity analyses examining the effect of various hypothetical fracture networks on the performance of a planned near surface disposal facility in terms of radionuclide transport behaviour. As it is impossible to predict the initiation and evolution of fracture networks and their characteristics in concrete structures over time scales of interest, several fracture networks have been postulated to test the sensitivity of radionuclide release from a disposal facility. Fluid flow through concrete matrix and fracture networks are modelled via Darcy's law. A single species radionuclide transport equation is employed for both matrix and fracture networks, which include the processes advection, diffusion, dispersion, sorption/desorption and radioactive decay. The sensitivity study evaluates variations in fracture network configuration and fracture width together with different sorption/desorption characteristics of radionuclides in a cement matrix, radioactive decay constants and matrix dispersivity. The effect of the fractures is illustrated via radionuclide breakthrough curves, magnitude and time of peak mass flux, cumulative mass flux and concentration profiles. For the investigated system, radionuclide properties and the imposed water flow boundary conditions, results demonstrate that: (i) magnitude of peak radionuclide fluxes is less sensitive to the fracture network geometry, (ii) timing of the peak radionuclide fluxes is possibly sensitive to the fracture networks, (iii) a uniform flow model represents a limiting case of a porous medium with large number of fine fractures, (iv) the effect of fracture width on the radionuclide flux depends on the ratio of fracture to matrix conductivity and is less sensitive if the ratio is large and the width is higher than a certain critical size, and (v) increased dispersivity in fractured media influences the transport behaviour differently compared to non-fractured media; in particular, the behaviour depends on the nature of fracture network.

Development of recycling processes for clean rejected MOX fuel pellets	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							MICROWAVE-HEATING METHOD; CONVERSION; URANIUM; POWDER; UO2	The dry and wet recycling processes have been developed for 100% recycling of Clean Reject Oxide (CRO) generated during the fabrication of MOX fuel, as CRO contains significant amount of plutonium. Plutonium being strategic material need to be circumvented from its proliferation issues related to its storage for long period. It was difficult to recycle CRO containing higher Pu content even with multiple oxidation and reduction steps. The mechanical recycling comprising of jaw crushing and sieving has been coupled with thermal pulverization for recycling CRO with higher Pu content in dry recycling technique. In wet recycling, MicroWave Direct Denitration (MWDD) technique has been developed for 100% recycling of CRO. The powder prepared by dry and wet (MWDD) recycling techniques was characterized by XRD and BET techniques and their effects on the pellets were evaluated. (U,21%Pu)O-2 pellets fabricated from virgin powder and MWDD were characterized using optical microscopy and alpha-autoradiography and the results obtained were compared. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Seo, H; Kim, JH; Bang, IC				Seo, Han; Kim, Ji Hyun; Bang, In Cheol			Subchannel analysis of a small ultra-long cycle fast reactor core	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							CANDLE FAST-REACTOR; FUEL	Thermal-hydraulic evaluation of a small ultra-long cycle fast reactor (UCFR) core is performed based on existing safety regulations. The UCFR is an innovative reactor newly designed with long-life core based on the breed-and-burn strategy and has a target electric power of 100 MWe (UCFR-100). Low enriched uranium (LEU) located at the bottom region of the core play the role of igniter to operate the UCFR for 60 years without refueling. A metallic form is selected as a burning fuel region material after the LEU location. HT-9 and sodium are used as cladding and coolant materials, respectively. In the present study, MATRA-LMR, subchannel analysis code, is used for evaluating the safety design limit of the UCFR-100 in terms of fuel, cladding, and coolant temperature distributions in the core as design criteria of a general fast reactor. The start-up period (0 year of operation), the middle of operating period (30 years of operation), and the end of operating cycle (60 years of operation) are analyzed and evaluated. The maximum cladding surface temperature (MCST) at the BOC (beginning of core life) is 498 degrees C on average and 551 degrees C when considering peaking factor, while the MCST at the MOC (middle of core life) is 498 degrees C on average and 548 degrees C in the hot channel, respectively, and the MCST at the EOC (end of core life) is 499 degrees C on average and 538 degrees C in the hot channel, respectively. The maximum cladding surface temperature over the long cycle is found at the BOC due to its high peaking factor. It is found that all results including fuel rods, cladding, and coolant exit temperature are below the safety limit of general SFR design criteria. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Multi-recycling of transuranic elements in a PWR assembly with reduced fuel rod diameter	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							PLUTONIUM	This paper examines the multi-recycling of transuranic (TRU) elements (Pu-Np-Am-Cm) in standard Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) assemblies. The original feed of TRU comes from legacy spent UOX fuel. For all subsequent recycling passes, TRU elements from the previous generation are employed, supplemented by TRU from legacy UOX fuel, as needed. The design criteria include: U-235 enrichment requirements to remain below 5 w/o, TRU loading limits to avoid return to criticality under voided conditions, and assembly power peaking factors. In order to carry out multiple recycling passes within the design envelope, additional neutron moderation is required and achieved by reducing the fuel pellet diameter by about 13%, thus keeping the assembly design compatible with current PWR core internals. TRU transmutation rates and long-term ingestion radiotoxicity results are presented for 15 recycling passes and compared to standard UOX and MOX once-through cycles. The results also show that TRU fuel isotopics and radiotoxicity tend towards an equilibrium, enabling further additional recycling passes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The excitation functions of the Nd-nat(d,x) Pm-151.150,Pm-149,Pm-148m,Pm-148g,Pm-146,Pm-144,Pm-143, Nd-149.147,Nd-139m, Pr-142 and Ce-139g nuclear reactions were assessed by using the stacked foil activation technique and high resolution gamma-spectrometry. The experimental excitation functions were compared to the theoretical predictions calculated with the modified model codes ALICE-IPPE-D and EMPIRE-II-D and with the data in the TENDL-2012 library based on latest version of the TALYS code. The application of the data in the field of medical isotope production and nuclear reaction theory is discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Microscopic evolution of these samples was carried out using non-destructive conductive atomic force microscopy and a nanohardness test. Analysis indicates that a large number of nanometer-sized protuberances of irradiated tungsten samples results from over-high internal pressure of nanometer-sized helium bubbles. Ordered and nanostructured helium bubbles with the same diameter and average spacing can be formed due to the self-trapping and self-organizing of helium atoms in the tungsten materials. In the case of pre-damaged, low-energy He+ irradiation results in a random distribution of nanostructured helium bubbles, indicating that high-energy He+ implantation results in serious irradiation damage of tungsten materials, acting as nuclei for helium bubbles.

In this work, we explore the use of a technical-scientific software program facilitating the intervention planning in irradiated environments using sound mathematical concepts. We show how the software can be used in planning future operations using a case studies: the decommissioning of a beam dump for a linear 160 MeV H- accelerator. Interactive visualization of the facilities and radiation levels, as well as tools for interactive trajectory planning are explored, as well as automatic calculation of the expected integrated individual dose contracted during an intervention.

Ideally, the characteristic gamma-ray emission lines from different isotopes provide an observable suitable for this task. However, these lines are generally lost in the fierce flux of radiation emitted by the fuel. The rates are so high that detector dead times limit measurements to only very small solid angles of the fuel. Only through the use of carefully designed view ports and long dwell times are such measurements possible. Recent advances in multilayer grazing-incidence gamma-ray optics provide a possible means of overcoming this difficulty. With a proper optical and coating design, such optics can serve as a notch filter, passing only narrow regions of the overall spectrum to a fully shielded detector that does not view the spent fuel directly. We report on the design of a mirror system and a number of experimental measurements. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Fast Reactor Cycle Technology Development project phase I results of key technology evaluations on a pantograph fuel handling machine (FHM), a fuel transfer pot with two core component positions, dry spent fuel cleaning and minor actinide-bearing fresh fuel shipping cask are summarized. A full-scale FHM mockup has been fabricated and tested in the air accumulating performance and seismic tolerance data. A mockup fuel transfer pot with fins and chromium carbide coating has been fabricated and tested with sodium accumulating heat transfer performance data. Several sodium cleaning tests using a dummy subassembly has been conducted accumulating cleaning performance data. For fresh fuel shipping cask, a design tool for evaluation of heat transfer capability has been developed and a helium gas cask shows cooling capability of minor actinide-bearing fresh fuel. Those experimental and analytical efforts have shown that key technologies to develop simplified fuel handling system are matured enough to proceed large-scale sodium experiments and conceptual design study for the demonstration JSFR.

In the present study, three 4H-SiC p-i-n diode detectors were fabricated as variations of those metal-electrode structures. The I-V characteristics and alpha-particle responses of the detectors were measured before and after gamma-ray exposure. The detector with a Ti/Au electrode showed the lowest change of leakage current after irradiation; none of the detectors showed any change in the charge-collection efficiency when a sufficient electric field was applied after gamma irradiation of up to 8.1 MGy.

As a result, it was found that these compounds precipitate almost quantitatively U(VI) as UO2(NO3)(2)L-2 (L = EU, PU) from 3.0M HNO3 solution. In contrast, these urea derivatives form neither solid precipitates nor oily products with U(IV) in HNO3 solutions containing only U(IV) species and even in U(VI)-U(IV) admixture system. Therefore, the separation of U(VI) from U(IV) was demonstrated to be achieved in use of EU and PU. Furthermore, EU and PU are capable to remove most of simulated FPs[Sr(II), Ru(III), Rh(III), Re(VII) La(III), Ce(III), Pr(III), Nd(III), and Sm(III)] from U(VI) to give their decontamination factors (DFs) higher than 100, while those values of Zr(IV), Mo(VI), Pd(II), and Ba(II) are necessary to be improved in both systems. From these results, it is expected that EU and PU are the promising precipitants for selective separation of U(VI) from HNO3 solutions dissolving spent FBR fuels.

The core characteristics were compared with those obtained using the unified cross-section set ADJ2000R in order to investigate the differences between both the results. The effects on the core characteristics caused by the differences in the nuclear data of important reactions and nuclides in the cross-section sets were analyzed by a burnup sensitivity analysis. It was confirmed that adopting JENDL-4.0 to the FBR core design improves the breeding ratio, the burnup reactivity, and the reactivity control balance, because of the differences in the capture cross-sections of U-238 and Pu-239 of both the libraries. The difference in the sodium void reactivity evaluated with both the libraries was less than 1% because the increase caused by the differences in the elastic scattering cross-sections of sodium, the inelastic scattering cross-section, and the -average value of U-238 was practically cancelled out by the decrease caused by the differences in the capture cross-sections of Pu-239, the inelastic scattering cross-section of iron, and the capture cross-sections of Am-241.

J	Yamamoto, K; Okumura, K				Yamamoto, Kento; Okumura, Keisuke			A study of the generation of U-232 in UO2 and MOX fuels	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						uranium; uranium 232; reprocessed uranium; MOX fuel; burnup calculation; ORIGEN2; ORLIBJ40		To clarify the generation pathway of U-232, an important nuclide for dose evaluation at various stages in the reuse of uranium, concentrations of U-232 generated through various pathways were evaluated for UO2 and mixed oxide (MOX) fuels. Burnup calculation was conducted with ORIGEN2.2 code adopting ORLIBJ40 library, a set of cross-section libraries based on JENDL-4.0. It was found that differences in U-232 concentrations in UO2 and MOX fuels mainly arise from differences in the initial compositions of U-234, U-235, and U-236. It was also found that the contribution of plutonium and americium isotopes in MOX fuels is small compared with that of uranium isotopes. The results clarified that the capture cross sections of Th-230, Pa-231, U-235, and U-236, as well as the (n,2n) cross sections of Np-237 and U-238, have a large effect on the generation of U-232. Additional investigation showed that U-232 concentration is strongly affected not only by time after irradiation but also by time before irradiation.

J	Bojinov, M; Nowak, E; Stanislowski, M; Saario, T				Bojinov, Martin; Nowak, Erika; Stanislowski, Michael; Saario, Timo			Effect of chloride transients on the corrosion behaviour of low alloyed steel in cladding flaws of reactor pressure vessels under oxygenated high-temperature water conditions	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article							SULFURIC-ACID-SOLUTIONS; CRACKING; GROWTH; 304-STAINLESS-STEEL; CHEMISTRY	Strain-induced corrosion cracking in low alloy steels (LAS) has been extensively investigated during the last decades. One finding from recent investigations is the detrimental role of even small amounts of chlorides, which has been shown to increase the cracking susceptibility of LAS. In order to evaluate this finding a demanding research programme has been established. In light water reactor plants, the pressure vessel and in some cases also the piping is made of LAS, covered with welded stainless steel cladding for improved corrosion protection. In structural failure assessments of primary circuits, penetrating cladding flaws have to be assumed, which could locally expose the underlying LAS to the cooling water. Due to the narrow opening of such weld defects the aqueous solution in contact with the underlying LAS would have a different composition from that of the bulk cooling water. In this paper, first detailed calculations of the water chemistry prevailing in such conditions revealed that oxygen concentration decreases rapidly when going from the mouth of the cladding flaw towards the bottom, bringing the redox potential to values, much lower than those typical for oxygenated high temperature water (HTW). Also, chloride was found to en-rich into the cladding flaw, volume by a factor of x30. The material studied was 20MnMoNi55 used for the reactor coolant line of a German NPP. Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that chloride transients up to 50 ppb in the bulk HTW, resulting in an enrichment of chloride in a penetrating cladding flaw up to 1,500 ppb, do not result in any serious consequences for the corrosion of LAS at the bottom of the cladding flaw.

J	Wasinger, K				Wasinger, Karl			Enhanced Productivity in Reactor Decommissioning and Waste Management	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article								As for any industrial facility, the service live of nuclear power plants, fuel cycle facilities, research and test reactors ends. Decision for decommissioning such facilities may be motivated by technical, economical or political reasons or a combination of it. As of today, a considerable number of research reactors, fuel cycle facilities and power reactors have been completely decommissioned. However, the end point of such facilities' lifetime is achieved, when the facility is finally removed from regulatory control and the site becomes available for further economical utilization. This process is commonly known as decommissioning and involves detailed planning of all related activities, radiological characterization, dismantling, decontamination, clean-up of the site including treatment and packaging of radioactive and/or contaminated material not released for unrestricted recycling or industrial disposal. Decommissioning requires adequate funding and suitable measures to ensure safety while addressing stakeholders' requirements on occupational health, environment, economy, human resources management and the socioeconomic effects to the community and the region. One important aspect in successful management of decommissioning projects and dismantling operation relates to the economical impact of the endeavor, primarily depending on the selected strategy and, as from commencement of dismantling, on total duration until the end point is achieved. Experience gained by Areva in executing numerous decommissioning projects during past 2 decades shows that time injury free execution and optimum productivity turns out crucial to project cost. Areva develops and implements specific "performance improvement plans" for each of its projects which follow the philosophy of operational excellence based on Lean Manufacturing principles. Means and methods applied in implementation of these plans and improvements achieved are described and examples are given on the way Areva offers to support owners to benefit from this experience.

J	Sokcic-Kostic, M; Schultheis, R				Sokcic-Kostic, Marina; Schultheis, Roland			Neutron Measurement Method for the Detection of Transuranic Elements in the Nuclear Fuel Cycle	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								By handling and storing burned-down fuel elements it is duty to measure the existing nuclear fuel content. For the criticality analysis of the interim storage, for instance, it is imperative to know the nuclear fuel inventory in order to give a detailed description on the safety of storage to the supervisory authority. Among other things, it is necessary to consider that the possibility of mixing up stored fuel elements in the fuel pool was not able to be excluded. Due to high penetration of matter and its origin from decay or spontaneous fission of transuranic elements neutron verification methods are suited best for the proof of fission material as long as it has been burned-down beforehand. If fission chambers are additionally used as detectors, measurements can be even carried out in environments with high gamma levels. A highly improved measuring quality can be achieved, by comparing measurement results with the results of computer-aided simulations such as e.g. burn-up programs or MCNP- calculations. Hereby the impact on the measurement result by special marginal conditions of the measuring environment (e.g. addition of boric acid into the water of the fuel pool) can be estimated and thus revised. It is shown, that the passive neutron measurement is much easier to manage as an active measurement. As restriction it is to be considered, that measurements refer essentially to transuranic elements. Uranium such as U-235, however, is difficult to detect. For fuel elements applies, that the creation of transuranic elements is directly linked to the burn-up of U-235. Hence direct conclusions to the burn-up of U-235 can be drawn, by measuring transuranic content.

Radiological characteristics of water transport canals - Example of the Rhone Languedoc Roussillon regional network	RADIOPROTECTION			French	Article						Water transport canals; Rhone river; water resources; biological production; naturally occurring particles	RADIONUCLIDES; RADIOACTIVITY; CONSEQUENCES; URANIUM; RIVER; SOIL	In many places in the world, canals represent a significant cumulative linear effect on the flow of surface waters and play a significant role in the redistribution of water resources. A radioecological study was conducted on the Languedoc Roussillon regional Rhodanian canals which transfer water from the river Rhone to the territories of the Gard and Herault for irrigation and drinking water supply. Our results show that the hydrological characteristics of water canals may impact significantly on the solid/solution distribution of trace elements in transit, and consequently on their transfer to the receiving environment. In addition to particle size segregation during transit, these results are most likely to be related to biological production (phytoplankton and zooplankton). These results highlight that the origin and quality of naturally occurring solid particles could play a fundamental role in the transfer of trace pollutants, especially in irrigation canals.

"Reference waters" in French laboratories involved in tritium monitoring: how tritium-free are they?	RADIOPROTECTION			English	Article						tritium; environmental monitoring; low doses; groundwaters; mass spectrometry	HE-3	This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the tritium content of "reference waters" in real working conditions by French laboratories involved in environmental monitoring. Reference waters are virtually tritium-free waters used to determine blanks for the analytical system and to check for any contamination. It is therefore crucial to be sure of the low tritium content of these waters as this can limit the sensitivity and accuracy of the measurements. Water from the commercial brand "Abatilles" is widely used in French laboratories and nine samples were analyzed in this study. Three samples from other deep aquifers were also included. The results all range from 0.004 +/- 0.004 Bq/kg to 0.175 +/- 0.011 Bq/kg, well below the 0.5 Bq/kg advised by the French Safety Authority. The spread of the results can mainly be attributed to contamination through plastic during bottle storage. As expected, two samples from demineralized tap water showed higher tritium activities (0.3-0.35 Bq/kg). Both waters are suitable as reference water for routine monitoring (DL of about 10 Bq/kg) but should be used with caution for activities in the Bq/kg range.

Transmission electron microscope observation showed that implantation of hydrogen into the specimens pre-irradiated by helium can result in obvious enhancement of bubble size and swelling rate which can be regarded as a consequence of hydrogen being trapped by helium bubbles. But when temperature increased, Ostwald ripening mechanism would become dominant, besides, too large a bubble could become mobile and swallow many tiny bubbles on their way moving, reducing bubble number density. And these effects were most remarkable at 450 degrees C which was the peak bubble swelling temperature for RAMF steel. When temperature was high enough, say above 450, point defects would become mobile and annihilate at dislocations or surface. As a consequence, helium could no longer effectively diffuse and clustering in materials and bubble formation was suppressed. When temperature was above 500, helium bubbles would become unstable and decompose or migrate out of surface. Finally no bubble was observed at 650 degrees C. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Activation analyses for the IFMIF-Liquid Breeder Validation Module (LBVM)	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						IFMIF; LBVM; Activation; Safety hazards; Lithium-lead; Liquid breeders	ACCELERATOR-DRIVEN SYSTEMS; FLUX TEST MODULE; NEUTRON SOURCE; NUCLEAR-DATA; LITHIUM	The Liquid Breeder Validation Module (LBVM) will be one of the medium flux irradiation modules of the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF) neutron source. The objective of this module presently under design is the test of functional materials related to liquid breeders for future nuclear fusion power reactors (DEMO). This paper aims to describe the activation analyses performed to estimate the radioactive inventory and the expected contact dose from the activated materials of the module following a 345 day irradiation period. These calculations supply valuable information for different aspects related to the design of the module, such as the safety evaluation and the waste management and disassembly plan. The neutron transport calculations have been performed using the McDeLicious code. The ACAB nuclear inventory code, with the activation nuclear libraries EAF-2007, has been used for the activation analyses. The main results point out that the contact dose of the LBVM materials is much higher than the hands-on-limits, as expected. Therefore, remote handling operations are requested for disassembling the module. It is important to remark that after 8 h decay time, the contact dose rate of the LBVM decreases 76% for the EUROFER steel components and 46% for the 316 LN components. Regarding the isotopic inventory, although the main activation comes from the module steel structures, the production of tritium and Po-210 in the lithium lead inside the experimental capsules deserved a careful analysis.

The neutron flux of the FDS-MFX blanket was calculated using VisualBUS code and Hybrid Evaluated Nuclear Data Library (HENDL) developed by FDS Team. Based on these calculated neutron fluxes, the activation properties of blanket materials were analyzed by the induced radioactivity, the decay heat and the contact dose rate for different regions of the FDS-MFX blanket. The safety and environment assessment of fusion power (SEAFP) strategy, which was developed in Europe, was applied to FDS-MFX blanket for the management of activated materials. Accordingly, the classification and management strategy of activated materials after different cooling time were proposed for FDS-MFX blanket. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The dynomak: An advanced spheromak reactor concept with imposed-dynamo current drive and next-generation nuclear power technologies	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						Spheromak; Helicity; Current drive; Reactor concept; Economics	TOKAMAK	A high-beta spheromak reactor concept has been formulated with an estimated overnight capital cost that is competitive with conventional power sources. This reactor concept utilizes recently discovered imposed-dynamo current drive (IDCD) and a molten salt (FLiBe) blanket system for first wall cooling, neutron moderation and tritium breeding. Currently available materials and ITER-developed cryogenic pumping systems were implemented in this concept from the basis of technological feasibility. A tritium breeding ratio (TBR) of greater than 1.1 has been calculated using a Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP5) neutron transport simulation. High temperature superconducting tapes (YBCO) were used for the equilibrium coil set, substantially reducing the recirculating power fraction when compared to previous spheromak reactor studies. Using zirconium hydride for neutron shielding, a limiting equilibrium coil lifetime of at least thirty full-power years has been achieved. The primary FLiBe loop was coupled to a supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle due to attractive economics and high thermal efficiencies. With these advancements, an electrical output of 1000 MW from a thermal output of 2486 MW was achieved, yielding an overall plant efficiency of approximately 40%. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Thorium fuel production and results from beginning of life irradiation	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st Symposium on the Scientific Basis of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle of the European-Material-Research-Society (EMRS)	MAY 27-31, 2013	Strasbourg, FRANCE	European Mat Res Soc		Thorium; Halden reactor; Test irradiation; Fuel production		An evolutionary, rather than a revolutionary approach to thorium fueled reactors is proposed with an introduction of thorium as the fertile component in mixed oxide fuel for conventional light water reactors. The utility of thorium as a component in today's light water reactors offers improved accident tolerance due to the superior material properties of thorium fuels over conventional uranium fuels. A few notable advantages include better thermal conductivity, higher melting point, higher oxide stability and superior spent fuel characteristics. Consequently, Thor Energy along with a consortium of industrial partners has established a fuel production and irradiation program aimed to license thorium fuels for use in today's light water reactors: Due to the morphology and physical properties of calcined thorium oxide powder, pellet fabrication used for standard uranium oxide fuels must be altered slightly for thorium bearing fuels to yield a product with acceptable theoretical densities, microstructure, and material integrity. At beginning of irradiation life fuel temperature data demonstrates improved fuel characteristics over standard uranium oxide fuel. Fuel centerline operating temperatures are 30-40 K less with a thorium mixed oxide fuel as compared to standard uranium fuel. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The behaviour of nano-crystalline refractory oxide of this kind has been studied above 1500 K for the first time here. The technique used is based on sub-second laser heating and fast pyrometry. Nano-crystalline UO2 with grains of (30 +/- 20) nm underwent fast oxidation due to the high specific surface. The measured melting point depression (up to over 300 K below 3120 K, the melting temperature of micrometer-sized UO2) was thus mostly attributable to a non-negligible oxygen-to-metal molar ratio increase and, possibly, only to a much lesser extent to a real grain-size effect.

Characterization of uranium neodymium oxide microspheres synthesized by internal gelation	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st Symposium on the Scientific Basis of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle of the European-Material-Research-Society (EMRS)	MAY 27-31, 2013	Strasbourg, FRANCE	European Mat Res Soc		Uranium; Neodymium; Internal gelation; Sol-gel; Nuclear fuel; Fuel fabrication	FABRICATION; (U	In the context of advanced nuclear fuel cycles including partitioning and transmutation (P&T), actinide co-conversion processes play an important role to close the loop. Therefore, actinides are embedded in ceramics to be used as precursors for the fabrication of fuels. The sol gel route by internal gelation is a suitable and dust-free conversion method. Furthermore, the required spherical particles are already formed at the gel stage. Pure UO2 microspheres and U/Nd oxide particles with a variable content of Nd (5-40%) were fabricated by internal gelation. Acid deficient uranyl nitrate and Nd nitrate solutions were used as precursor for the microsphere fabrication. Neodymium is used as a surrogate for trivalent actinides, such as americium. Mass- and diameter-distributions were studied and particle densities were calculated. Finally, the microspheres were thermally treated in a reducing H-2:Ar gas atmosphere at 1573 K. The solid solutions of UO2 and Nd2O3 were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray powder diffraction. The obtained reflexes are indicating one cubic phase. Lattice parameter calculations were performed, the results depend linear on the Nd content up to approximate to 30%. Particle compositions containing more Nd are showing an unexpected behavior.

Existence of a miscibility gap in uranium neodymium oxide materials used as nuclear fuels simulants	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st Symposium on the Scientific Basis of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle of the European-Material-Research-Society (EMRS)	MAY 27-31, 2013	Strasbourg, FRANCE	European Mat Res Soc		HBS; Simulated nuclear fuels; HT-XRD; Miscibility gap	X-RAY-DIFFRACTION; LATTICE-PARAMETER; PHASE-DIAGRAM; FISSION-PRODUCTS; SOLID-SOLUTION; TEMPERATURE; UO2	During the irradiation of oxide nuclear fuels used in pressurized water reactors, many microstructural modifications occur which affect the fuel performance. This work focuses on the thermodynamic evolution of the fuel under these conditions, with a special regard to the influence of lanthanides content. For this purpose, simulant materials have been synthesized to model irradiated fuels. They consist of (U,Nd)O-2 doped ceramics, neodymium being added since it is the most abundant lanthanide fission product. A previous study carried out on these systems highlighted, for the first time, the possible existence of a miscibility gap in the U-Nd-O ternary system, with an experimental evidence of a biphasic equilibrium at room temperature, for a Nd content larger than 6 wt%. In the current work, high temperature X-ray diffraction experiments up to 1973 K on (U0.72Nd0.28)O2-x samples are reported. The results confirm the existence of a miscibility gap. In fact, the system is monophasic at elevated temperatures and a phase separation occurs below 745 K, with two face-centered cubic phases in equilibrium. A preliminary evaluation of the tie-line associated to the biphasic system at room temperature is proposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A comparison of empirical potential models for the simulation of dislocations in uranium dioxide	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st Symposium on the Scientific Basis of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle of the European-Material-Research-Society (EMRS)	MAY 27-31, 2013	Strasbourg, FRANCE	European Mat Res Soc		Dislocations; Simulation	MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; INTERATOMIC POTENTIALS; UO2; DEFECT; FUEL	The presence of dislocations, resulting from high levels of irradiation, in nuclear fuel may have a profound effect on the fuel's properties. Here atomistic simulations, employing empirical pair potentials, are used to examine the core structures of a series of dislocations in UO2 with Burgers vector 1/2(110) and their relative stabilities are assessed by comparing their line energies. As there are a large number of empirical pair potential models available for UO2 a critical assessment of the efficacy of the potential models is also presented. There is a high level of agreement between the different pair potential models with all those tested predicting the same ordering of the dislocation stabilities i.e. screw < (100}(110) < {111)(110) < {110}(110) which is in excellent agreement with experiment.

Swelling due to the partition of soluble fission products between the grey phase and uranium dioxide	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st Symposium on the Scientific Basis of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle of the European-Material-Research-Society (EMRS)	MAY 27-31, 2013	Strasbourg, FRANCE	European Mat Res Soc		Nuclear fuel; Uranium dioxide; Grey phase; Computer simulation; Swelling; Fission products	FUEL; STABILITY; SOLIDS; OXIDES; ZRO2	The change in volume associated with the partition of soluble cations from uranium dioxide into the (Ba,Sr)ZrO3 grey phase has been investigated using atomic scale simulations. Here past work on the thermodynamic drive for the segregation of trivalent and tetravalent cations from uranium dioxide is built upon in the context of fuel swelling. Only small tetravalent cations segregate into the grey phase and this is predicted to result in an overall reduction in fuel volume. Individual trivalent cations that segregate, can cause either a contraction or an expansion of the overall fuel volume. Cr2O3 doped UO2 promotes co-partition forming mixed cation clusters in the grey phase and causing an overall reduction in fuel volume for all trivalent cations. This may have implications for fuel performance and may alter other fuel swelling mechanisms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Cooper, M. W. D.; Middleburgh, Sc; Grimes, R.

In particular, the effect of off-stoichiometric compositions on the damage evolution during a displacement cascade has been investigated, which appears to be a novel study, to the best of literature review achieved. The study has been performed by means of molecular dynamics simulations and, using a powerful tool developed for the purpose, the damage has been analysed thoroughly as cascade-induced point defects and point defect clusters. The results have revealed first of all that the composition does not affect the damage development in the time frame corresponding to the thermal spike. Second of all, as the displacement cascade relaxes and persistent damage shows up in the structures, the results have indicated that off-stoichiometric compositions induced mitigation or even recovery of the damage created by the cascade, due to different mechanisms that depend on the nature and the amount of initial point defects distributed in the material due to off-stoichiometry. Third and last of all, it has been observed that the clustering behaviour in off-stoichiometric structures is also affected accordingly, and overall, the results have evidenced the formation in hyper-stoichiometric structures of interstitial clusters referred to as "split-interstitial clusters", as alluded to in other very recent studies.

Design, development and utilisation of a tomography station for gamma-ray emission and transmission analyses of light water reactor spent fuel rods	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st Symposium on the Scientific Basis of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle of the European-Material-Research-Society (EMRS)	MAY 27-31, 2013	Strasbourg, FRANCE	European Mat Res Soc		Emission tomography; Transmission tomography; Fission product distribution; Caesium; High burnup; Burnup monitors	DISTRIBUTIONS; UO2	A tomographic measurement station has been designed and developed for the investigation of light water reactor spent fuel rod segments. A unique feature of the station is that it allows both gamma-ray transmission and emission computerised tomography to be performed on individual fresh or burnt fuel rods. The basics of the tomographic station design, construction and operation are presented together with the results of four burnt UO2 fuel rod segments investigated, with rod average burnups of 54, 71, 91 and 121 MWd kg(-1). The combination of transmission and emission tomography techniques performed on an individual object provides a synergetic experimental approach. By performing transmission tomography, not only the average material density but also detailed spatial distributions of the density and of the gamma-ray linear attenuation coefficient have been determined for each sample. By performing emission tomography, the determination of within-rod internal radial distributions of Cs-134, Cs-137 and Eu-154 has also been achieved for each individual pin. The results have indicated large central depressions in the caesium distributions because of isotope migration, with varying magnitude from sample to sample. Finally and in addition to the tomographic reconstructions, the possibility to use single isotope activities, and/or isotopic concentration ratios from Cs-134, Cs-137, and Eu-154, as burnup indicators at very high and ultra-high burnups, has also been investigated. This paper presents in a comprehensive manner the large panel of analysis performed for this interesting set of spent fuel samples which represents a valuable experimental insight in the physics of ultra-high burnups.

Scanning acoustic microscope for mechanical characterization and density estimation of irradiated nuclear fuel	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st Symposium on the Scientific Basis of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle of the European-Material-Research-Society (EMRS)	MAY 27-31, 2013	Strasbourg, FRANCE	European Mat Res Soc		Acoustic microscopy; Young's modulus; Density; Irradiated fuel; Burnup effects	ELASTIC PROPERTIES; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; ULTRASONIC VELOCITY	Thanks to high frequency ultrasonic surface waves generated by specific focused transducers, a non destructive evaluation of the elastic moduli of very small or heterogeneous samples can be achieved. This method, called acoustic microscopy, was developed and tested for many years as cold and hot set-up; in 2011 an optimized version of the high frequency acoustic microscope has been definitively introduced in hot cell. This apparatus now constitutes a standard facility for irradiated fuels and materials characterization. This paper presents a review of the studies performed on different irradiated fuels in order to determine the elastic moduli. Behaviour laws are proposed in the burnup range up to similar to 103 MWd kg(-1). The results, supported by benchmarking the outcome of acoustic measurements with other characterization techniques, indicate that the elastic modulus of irradiated fuel can be assessed without preliminary knowledge of density. Thus with a single non-destructive measurement it is possible to assess both the density and the Young's modulus with an acceptable precision. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Historically characterization was limited by instrumentation available. Great strides have been made in new characterization techniques, yet there application to irradiated fuels has been delayed due to the difficulty of working with the samples. This paper outlines the first results from the application of a dual-column focused ion beam along with energy dispersive spectroscopy and electron backscatter diffraction detectors to analyze the 3D structure of high burn-up MOX fuel.

A revaporisation device was built to provide experimental data on fission product transport and deposition for severe accident codes (e.g. ASTEC). The other aim was to study in detail revaporisation processes associated with different stages of a severe accident involving fuel degradation including melting. The device allows us to study the transport behaviour of gamma-emitting FPs under oxidising and reducing conditions over the temperature range 200-1000 degrees C at ambient pressure. A lanthanum (III)bromide (LaBr3) detector is used to measure the amount of revaporised FPs as a function of time and temperature. This paper describes the main features of this device, including a series of upgrades on-going or planned to extend the applicable range of FPs and atmosphere conditions. Test results of FPs deposited on the surface of stainless steel rings from the upper vertical line of the Phebus FP tests are presented. Experiments under steam atmosphere showed that revaporisation of Cs-137 starts at 540 degrees C progressing rapidly until near the total depletion of the deposit, resulting in a total revaporisation of similar to 92%.
