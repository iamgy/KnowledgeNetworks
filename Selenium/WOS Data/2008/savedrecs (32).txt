Impact of antifoam agent addition on hydrogen formation in the Hanford Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article								Ventilation and mixing systems in the Hanford Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) are being designed to account for the flammable gas hydrogen that will form in process streams, just as it also does in the radioactive liquid wastes awaiting immobilization at the Hanford Tank Farms. Tank wastes forming hydrogen at the highest rates do so by reactions involving dissolved organic complexant compounds, even though hydrogen is also formed by the better known radiolysis pathway. Hydrogen generation rates (HGRs) are predicted with a correlation relating waste properties to reaction pathways involving radiolysis of water and the degradation of organic compounds. This correlation accounts only for aqueous phase reactions. An antifoam agent (AFA) will be added to waste processed in the WTP, This organic liquid mixture is immiscible in aqueous systems and will therefore form a nonaqueous phase liquid layer on the processed waste, unless some of its compounds are unstable in the hostile physical/chemical environment and break down into soluble degradation products. Dissolved organic species increase the organic source term in the WTP HGR correlation, but the correlation requires adaptation to address hydrogen formed from immiscible organic liquids. Here, we report our initial evaluation of the hydrogen formed by Co-60 gamma irradiation of a waste simulant containing Dow Corning Q2-3183A AFA with an adapted WTP HGR correlation.	[Sherwood, D.

On monitoring the tritium-breeding ratio in a fusion reactor	PLASMA DEVICES AND OPERATIONS			English	Article						tritium; fusion reactor; blanket; lithium		A concept of tritium-breeding monitoring in the DEMO reactor is discussed. A system for experimental estimation of the tritium-breeding ratio and the tritium-breeding dynamics in a helium-cooled experimental breeding submodule (EBSM) of the International Thermonuclear Expeimental Reactor is proposed. A schematic diagram of the EBSM system and the design of its units are considered. Operation of the system in different modes is discussed. A pneumatic method is proposed to deliver the detectors to the tritium-breeding zone of the EBSM and to extract the detectors by using tritium-breeding channels. The channels are connected to the EBSM and to an operating zone. The results of the channel-cooling calculation carried out under nominal operating conditions of the EBSM (a plasma pulse) and the calculation of parameters of tritium detector transportation are presented in the paper.

THE STRAIGHT FIELD LINE CONCEPT AND APPLICATIONS	PROBLEMS OF ATOMIC SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							TRANSMUTATION; FUSION	The straight field line mirror field is a marginal minimum B field with straight nonparallel field lines. This field gives optimal ellipticity, the drift surfaces lie on a magnetic surface, radiofrequency heating of the plasma is predicted to be efficient and MHD stability is provided by the minimum B property. One intended application of the magnetic field configuration is energy production and transmutation of spent nuclear fuel in a fusion-fission machine, where the mirror confined plasma is surrounded by a fission mantle. Reactor safety can be increased with a subcritical fission mantle, and the fission power can exceed the fusion power by as much as a factor of 150 with a reasonable condition for reactor safety margins, and this provides a basis for a compact reactor design. The straight field line mirror concept can also be of interest as a plasma source for synthesis of sophisticated materials.	[Agren, O.; Moiseenko, V.

STUDY OF DEUTERIUM PLASMA INTERACTION WITH A TUNGSTEN TARGET WITHIN RPI-IBIS FACILITY	PROBLEMS OF ATOMIC SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								The paper presents results of experimental research on the interaction of a pulsed plasma-ion stream with a tungsten (W) target. The pulsed deuterium plasma was produced within the RPI-IBIS (Multi-Rod Plasma Injector) facility at IPJ in Swierk. Measurements were carried out by means of optical spectroscopy and corpuscular diagnostic techniques. Structural changes in the irradiated targets were investigated with a SEM. Before experiments with the W-target there were determined operational conditions, when clean deuterium plasma streams can be generated. For that purpose a so-called "slow or PID (Plasma Ion Deposition) mode" of the RPI-IBIS operation was chosen. Particular attention was paid to the identification of spectral lines from WI and WII species. The obtained results, i.e. optical spectra and other characteristics have demonstrated applicability of the RPI-IBIS facility for research on the interaction of plasma streams with W-targets, e. g. those constituting some internal parts of fusion facilities.

THE OPTICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF CONTAMINATING FILMS ON Mo, SS AND Cu MIRROR SAMPLES EXPOSED IN PLASMA DEVICES	PROBLEMS OF ATOMIC SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								The optical methods with the use of in-vessel first mirrors (FMs) are expected to occupy an important place in the diagnostic complex of the future fusion reactor ITER. As the surface of FMs will be subjected to physical sputtering by high-energy D and T charge-exchange atoms, this can lead to a decline in the initial FM reflectance. The second factor of FM reflectance deterioration is the redeposition of contaminants on the mirror surface. In the paper, optical indices and thickness values of the films deposited on Mo and SS mirrors in the tokamak TRIAM-1M as well as on SS and Cu mirrors in the torsatron URAGAN-3M were studied by ellipsometry at the wavelength lambda= 632.8 nm. The spectral reflectance at normal incidence of light for all the samples was measured in the wavelength range lambda= 253-650 nm. The optical parameters of TRIAM-1M films were determined as the film was progressively removed by deuterium plasma ions in the stand DSM-2.	[Bondarenko, V. N.; Konovalov, V. G.; Ryzhkov, I.

With the nuclear renaissance, microwaves have been applied in nuclear chemistry and engineering in recent years. This paper is a brief review about microwave sintering of UO2 pellets, (U, Th)O-2 and MOX powders, conversion of high enriched uranyl (HEU) nitrate into uranium oxide by microwave heating and microwave assisted analysis of radioactive elements. It has been realized that microwave energy has great potential to improve the nuclear fuel process in terms of reduction in required processing time and temperature and increased recovery of elements. However, the application of microwave energy in nuclear chemistry and engineering is in the early stages. Microwave energy has significant advantages that are waiting to be explored.

J	Reiss, T; Feher, S; Czifrus, S				Reiss, T.; Feher, S.; Czifrus, Sz.			Coupled neutronics and thermohydraulics calculations with burn-up for HPLWRs	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						HPLWR; neutronics; thermohydraulics; coupled program system; burn-up		The HPLWR (High-Performance Light Water Reactor) is the European version of the SCWR (Supercritical-pressure Water Cooled Reactor) concept, which is one of the Generation IV reactors. In this reactor the primary water enters the core of the HPLWR under supercritical-pressure condition (25 MPa) at a temperature of 280 degrees C and leaves it at a temperature of up to 5 10 degrees C. Due to the significant changes in the physical properties of water at supercritical-pressure the system is susceptible to local temperature, density and power oscillations. This inclination is increased by the pseudocritical transformation of the supercritical-pressure water used as primary coolant. At the Budapest University of Technology a coupled neutronics-thermohydraulics program system has been developed which is capable of determining the steady-state equilibrium parameters and calculating the related power, temperature, etc. distributions for the above-mentioned reactor. The program system can be used to optimize the axial enrichment profile of the fuel rods (e.g. in order to obtain a uniform power distribution). Since the power distribution will change with burn-up, which causes a change in the temperature and density distributions, a coupled neutronics - thermohydraulics - burn-up calculation is required. Therefore, the program system has been extended with the ORIGEN-S burn-up calculator. In the paper the developed program system and its features are presented. Parametric studies for different operating conditions were carried out and the obtained results are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All fights reserved.

We then propose a representative system-level integration of these solutions to the longstanding problems that have confronted nuclear fission-based power. This integration obviates all fuel supply issues, including the entire set of isotopic enrichment ones, while rendering comparably useful as nuclear fuels all of the actinide elements and isotopes. It entirely avoids transport and reprocessing and the full set of ad hoc waste disposal issues, and completely precludes all those involving proliferation/diversion of fissile isotopes into weapons' programs. It offers high-grade heat in pressurized helium gas for thermodynamically efficient, economically appealing, environmentally attractive combined-cycle conversion to electricity while robustly avoiding prospects of internal overheating of any portion of the reactor's core or fuel. It provides highly redundant means of any desired statistical reliability for prevention of core meltdown in LOCA circumstances. It provides zero biospheric hazard in event of either natural or man-made catastrophe. It requires - indeed, admits of - no operator control actions, other than initial start-up and final shutdown commands, so that operator errors are entirely precluded; during the half-century of potentially full-power operational life in between these two commands, it thermostatically regulates in an entirely automatic manner its own nuclear power generation to match the heat removed from its core in a time-varying fashion. The thorium-burning variant of this new class of reactors involves no long-lived actinide isotopes, thereby obviating a present-day keystone issue of long-term reactor waste storage and disposal. Each of these novel features is technologically separable, so that these new reactor design concepts may be applied piecewise to enhance prospects of nuclear reactor-centered power generation in many different utilization circumstances. However, synergisms arising from their full integration seem likely to be compellingly attractive in most situations, for a constellation of economic and safety reasons. We therefore project a bright future for cheap electricity safely obtained in > 10 TWe quantities from nuclear power reactors of this new type, moreover over multi-century time frames. We observe that pertinent aspects of neutron physics and modem technology together offer a far richer spectrum of possibilities for nuclear power reactors than has been significantly explored through the present; the present architecture is merely exemplary.

From safety point of view, the change of excess reactivity along burnup is theoretically zero, and the core characteristics, such as power feedback coefficients and power peaking factor, are not changed along burnup. Application of this burnup strategy to neutron rich fast reactors makes excellent performances. Only natural or depleted uranium is required for the replacing fuels. About 40% of natural or depleted uranium undergoes fission without the conventional reprocessing and enrichment. If the LWR produced energy of X Joules, the CANDLE reactor can produce about 50X Joules from the depleted uranium left at the enrichment facility for the LWR fuel. If we can say LWRs have produced energy sufficient for full 20 years, we can produce the energy for 1000 years by using the CANDLE reactors with depleted uranium. We need not mine any uranium ore, and do not need reprocessing facility. The burnup of spent fuel becomes 10 times. Therefore, the spent fuel amount per produced energy is also reduced to one-tenth. The details of the scenario of CANDLE burnup regime after LWR regime will be presented at the symposium. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

CANDLE: the new burnup strategy. Nucl. Sci. Eng. 139 (3), 306-317). These distinctive characteristics eliminate the necessity of both enrichment and reprocessing processes that are recognized as essentially inevitable parts in the conventional nuclear energy concept. This paper describes that the potential performance of CANDLE reactor to meet a projected energy demand growth of the world with stabilizing carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere and simultaneously minimize the risk of nuclear material proliferation. A type of CANDLE reactor with moderate initial fissile inventory is feasible to be deployed with prompt enough introduction pace to satisfy the worldwide energy growth and limit the carbon dioxide concentration to about 550 ppm in the next century. Ultimately high proliferation resistance performance as a fission energy system is found for the CANDLE system due to the elimination of most vulnerable processes in the conventional fuel cycle.

This bilateral cooperation can easily be expanded into a regional cooperation benefiting the scholars from Asian region which is expecting a New Nuclear Age in the 21st Century. To develop and realize this cooperative activities, in the first step, we invite the ideas of our partners in the Nuclear Institution and in Universities. They are eager to have and undertake this cooperation effort. For nuclear research activities, they have proposed several topics which include: advanced radioactive waste technology and management in a nuclear power plant, innovative fuel development for LWR's, gas cooled reactor for electricity and hydrogen production and a topic on design and construction of high energy accelerator.

Design innovations examined for power increase include intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) design optimization, riser diameter optimization, introducing a flow partition inside the riser, increasing the cooling time of the LWR discharged TRU, increasing the minor actinides' concentration in the loaded fuel and split-enrichment for power flattening. Another design innovation described utilizes a unique synergism between the use of MA and the design of reduced power ENHS cores. Also described is a radically different ENHS reactor concept that has a solid core from which heat pipes transport the fission power to a coolant circulating around the reflector. Promising features of this design concept include enhanced decay heat removal capability; no positive void reactivity coefficient; no direct contact between the fuel clad and the coolant; a core that is more robust for transportation; higher coolant temperature potentially offering higher energy conversion efficiency and hydrogen production capability.

In addition to large amount of resources in the world which up to now still not utilized optimally, thorium based thermal reactors may have high internal conversion ratio so that they are very potential to be designed as long-life reactors without on-site refueling based on thermal spectrum cores. In this study preliminary study for application of thorium cycle in some of thermal reactors has been performed. We applied thorium cycle for small long-life high temperature gas reactors without on-site refueling. Calculation results using SRAC code show that 10 years lifetime without on-site refueling can be achieved with excess reactivity of about 10% dk/k. The next application of thorium cycle has been employed in long-life small and medium PWR cores without on-site refueling. Relatively high fuel volume fraction is also applied to get relatively hard spectrum, small size, and high internal conversion ratio. In the current study we have been able to reach more than 10 years lifetime without on-site refueling for 20-300 MWth PWR with maximum excess reactivity of a few %dk/k. The last application of thorium cycle has been employed in long-life BWR cores without on-site refueling. Relatively high fuel volume fraction is applied to get relatively hard spectrum, small size, and high internal conversion ratio. In the current study we have been able to reach more than 10 years lifetime without on-site refueling for 100-600 MWth BWR with maximum excess reactivity of a few %dk/k.

The reactor technology was based on that of conventional LWRs. The reactor core consists of 12 cassettes containing fuel rods with a similar design to that of PWR fuel rods. Cassettes are placed in air at atmospheric pressure. Tube-type control clusters placed outside the pressure boundary are used as the core shutdown system. Natural circulation with two-phase flow is employed for the core cooling system and no re-circulation pumps are required. With these concepts the Package-Reactor eliminates any active components that operate in high pressure regions of the reactor and its capital costs can be reduced. The feasibility of reactivity control by using moderator void feedback and burnable poisons was studied to reduce operational and maintenance costs. It was found that a continuous operation of more than 5 years without any operations to control reactivity would be feasible with a UO2 fuel enrichment of 5.0 wt%, which is the upper limit for UO2 fuel enrichment under the current regulations in Japan. In addition, we researched the core reflectors' characteristics of the Package-Reactor. (C). 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The main constraint on this reactor design is its transportability. The whole reactor module should be transportable on a rail cart. This imposes a volume envelope of approximately 4.5 x 4.5 x 24 m and the maximum weight of about 300 tons. Therefore, the reactor vessel is 3 m in diameter and 3.85 m tall. In order to satisfy the proliferation resistance requirements the reactor is sealed after the fuel is loaded and shall not be opened until it is shipped back after it reaches its end of lifetime after 15years. The reactor fuel is 11% and 13% enriched plutonium nitride. Reactor power is 50 MWth which translates into 15 MWc. Reactor pool is at nearly atmospheric pressure. Core inlet and outlet temperature are 350 and 365 degrees C, respectively. The reactor uses electromagnetic pumps to drive the primary coolant circulation. Secondary system consists of saturated steam cycle operating at 7 MPa and 290 degrees C. This reactor is well suited for secluded areas with the demand for electricity such as small islands.

Results of the core nuclear analyses show that it is possible to recycle FR spent fuel once and to have 1.01 of breeding ratio without radial blanket region. The comparison is made among three kinds of recycle fuels, LWR UO2 spent fuel, LWR MOX spent fuel, and FR spent fuel. The recycle fuels reach an equilibrium state after recycles regardless of their starting heavy metal compositions, and the recycled FR fuel has the lowest radio-activity and the same level of heat generation among the recycle fuels. Therefore, the compound process fuel cycle has flexibility to recycle both LWR spent fuel and FR spent fuel. The concept has a possibility of enhancement of nuclear non-proliferation and process simplification of fuel cycle. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The present cermet fuel consists of an oxide solid solution of Th and minor actinides and Mo-inert matrix. It has been proposed as a high-performance device that can enhance minor actinide incineration in a fast reactor cycle. It is used in an independent small sub-cycle, whereby dedicated cycle technologies are adopted. Two-step reprocessing process was proposed for the present cermet fuel; it consists of a pre-removal of Mo-inert matrix and an actinide recovery. A preliminary test for the pre-removal of Mo-inert matrix was carried out using a surrogate cermet fuel. Burnup characteristics of a fast reactor core loaded with the cermet fuel were investigated by using neutronic calculation codes. It was revealed that a heterogeneous composition of Mo-inert matrix in inner and outer cores may lead to an effective transmutation of minor actinides and a flattened power density. It was concluded that the present cermet fuel was potentially promising as a high-performance incineration device of minor actinides for fast reactors. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A boundary value problem of a single group diffusion equation coupled with simplified burn-up equations is studied, where the natural radioactive decay processes are neglected in the burn-up modelling. An asymptotic burning wave solution is found analytically in the one-dimensional case, which is called as fundamental burn-up mode. Among this solution family there are two particular cases, namely, a classic fundamental solution with a zero burn-up and a partial solitary burn-up wave solution with a highest burn-up. An example of Th-U conversion is considered and the solutions are presented in order to show the mechanism of the burning wave. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Preliminary neutronic calculations of the "METAL-KAMADO" show possibility of high burn-up of more than 120 GWd/t with 10% enriched U-Zr fuel. Reactivity coefficients of the core are also discussed.

It means burning of fissionable part of its inventory and transmutation of other radionuclides by use of nuclear reactions with neutrons in an MSR - SPHINX system. In the SPHINX R&D program, there are besides computational analyses also experimental activities involved in the program, which serves for a verification of design inputs for designing of a demonstration unit of the MSR-type. The experimental program EROS will focus on a largescale experimental verification of design inputs by use of MSR-type inserting zones into the existing light water moderated experimental reactor LR-0, which may allow to modify it to experimental zero power salt reactor SR-0. There will be a detail description of the proposed program given in the paper together with the so far performed experiments and their preliminary results. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The first part of the study investigated the graphite-to-MS volume ratio on the neutron balance, transmutation characteristics and graphite lifetime. It is found that a core without graphite moderator is the preferred design option; it offers the best neutron balance, most compact design and alleviated graphite lifetime problem. The second part of the study investigated sensitivity of the epithermal spectrum core to the feed composition, power density, fission products residence time and actinides loss fraction. It is found that the transmutation effectiveness improves with increasing power density and that the shorter the LWR spent fuel cooling time is. the better becomes the MSR neutron balance. The optimal MSR design offers a remarkably high transmutation capability - fissioning of as high as 99.8% of the TRU fed. The transmutation capability of the MSR is also rated in terms of final waste radiotoxicity, decay heat, spontaneous fission neutrons emission, fissile and Np-237 inventory. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We learned that one potential application of the burning strategy for thermal reactors is for the High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactors (HTGR) with prismatic/block-type fuel elements. Several characteristics of CANDLE burning strategy such as constant reactor characteristics during burn-up, no need for burn-up reactivity control mechanism, proportionality of core height with core lifetime, sub-criticality of fresh fuel elements, etc. enable us to design small sized HTGR with a high degree of safety, easiness of operation and maintenance, and long core lifetime which are required for introducing the reactors into remote areas or developing countries with limited infrastructures and resources. In the present work, we report our evaluation results on small sized block-type HTGR designs with CANDLE burning strategy and compared with other existing small HTGR designs including the ones with pebble fuel elements, under both uranium and thorium fuel cycles.

Optimization of flux distribution in a molten-salt reactor with a 2-region core for plutonium burning	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	COE-INES 2nd International Symposium on Innovative Nuclear Energy Systems for Sustainable Development of the World	NOV 26-30, 2006	Yokohama, JAPAN	COE-INES, Tokyo Inst Technol, Res Lab Nucl Reactors, Tokyo Inst Technol, Ctr Res Innovat Nucl Energy Syst, Atom Energy Soc Japan		molten-salt reactor; neutron flux; thorium; uranium-233; plutonium; criticality; Th-u fuel cycle; nuclear characteristics		Molten-salt reactors (MSRs) are selected as one of the candidates of Generation IV reactor concepts. In GLOBAL2005 held in Tsukuba, Japan, one paper discussed the flattening of fast neutron flux in the core for a longer life of graphite moderator. In the paper a 3-region reactor concept was presented. The authors tried many cores changing configurations such as volume of each region and fractions of fuel salt in the regions or fuel compositions. We investigated the other possibility of a 2-region core for the simplicity. Using one energy group neutron diffusion theory and considering extrapolation distance, the optimum selection of region wise neutron multiplication factors can be theoretically and easily obtained. In MSRs, there is no burnup distribution of the fuel. The region wise neutron multiplications can be obtained by adjusting the volume fraction of fuel in a cell with a given composition of the fuel salt. Using the theoretical results, the optimization of the actual core configuration was determined by a nuclear analysis code SRAC2002 with the nuclear data library of JENDL3.3. In this paper, we considered MSRs using plutonium as a fissile material. Ordinary MSRs use uranium-233, which doesn't exist naturally, and utilizing plutonium is easier to startup.

It is found that the required P/D ratio is sensitive to, primarily, the initial concentration of the short-lived isotope Pu-241 in the fuel loaded into the first core and to the core power density. The longer is the cooling time of the TRU from LWR spent fuel the smaller becomes the relative Pu-241 concentration and the smaller becomes the fraction of Pu-241 lost via radioactive decay and, hence, the smaller needs be the conversion ratio required for nearly zero burnup reactivity swing and the larger can be the P/D ratio. Likewise, the higher is the ENHS power density, the smaller becomes the fraction of Pu-241 lost via radioactive decay and the larger becomes the P/D required for the first core. The optimal P/D ratio tends to increase with the number of times the fuel is recycled from one ENHS core to the next one. The optimal P/D ratio for the equilibrium composition core is in between 1.53 and 1.59. For a given discharge burnup it tends to somewhat increase with the equilibrium core power density. However, if structural materials will be developed to enable a 20 years core life at elevated power densities, the higher the power density the smaller is the required equilibrium PID ratio.

In general MOX fuel (UO2-PUO2) has lower atomic density compared to the nitride or metal fuel, but MOX fuel has some advantages such as higher Doppler coefficient, high melting point and availability. Nitride fuel has advantages such as high density, high thermal conductivity, and high melting point, but need N-15 to avoid C-14 problems. The results show that nitride fuel as well as MOX fuel can be used to develop 25- 100 MWe (75-300 MWth) Pb-Bi cooled long life reactors without on-site fuelling. The results show that nitride fuels have more superior neutronic characteristics compared to that of MOX fuel due to higher density. However, in the large power level both fuels can be easily applied. In lower power level the MOX fuel need higher fuel volume fraction to reach the comparable target of nitride fuelled cores.

The T-H optimization variables include the intermediate heat exchanger number of channels, channel width and elevation; diameter of the riser and diameter of a flow-splitting shroud in the riser. It was found possible to increase the attainable power from the nominal 125 MWth up to 311 MWth for the reference core, 400 MWth for a reference-like core having equilibrium composition fuel and 372 MWth for a flattened power core with 9 plutonium concentration zones. A power level exceeding 400 MWth may be achieved by flattening the power distribution of the equilibrium core or using nitride fuel with enriched nitrogen rather than metallic fuel. With forced circulation it is possible to operate the flattened power core at up to 532 MWth corresponding to 223 MWe. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

CANDLE small long-life fast reactor which does not require control rods, mining, enrichment and reprocessing plants can satisfy this demand. In a CANDLE reactor, the shapes of neutron flux, nuclide number densities and power density distributions remain constant and only shift in axial direction. The core with 1.0 m radius, 2.0 m length can realize CANDLE burn-up with nitride (enriched N- 15) natural uranium as fresh fuel. Lead-Bismuth is used as coolant. From steady state analysis, we obtained the burn-up velocity, output power distribution, core temperature distribution, etc. The burn-up velocity is less than 1.0 cm/year that enables a long-life design easily. The core averaged discharged fuel burn-up is about 40%. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It is recognized that excess neutrons from FBRs with good neutron economic characteristics can be efficiently used for producing U-233. Two distinct metallic fuel pins, one with natural uranium and another with natural thorium, are loaded into a large sodium-cooled FBR. U-233 and the associated-U isotopes are extracted from the thorium fuel pins. The FBR itself is self-sustained by plutonium produced in the uranium fuel pins. Under the equilibrium state, both uranium and thorium spent fuels are periodically discharged with a certain discharge rate and then separated. All discharged fission products are removed and all discharged actinides are returned to the FBRs except the discharged uranium utilized for fresh fuel of the other thorium-cycled reactors. U-233-production rate of the FBRs as a function of both the uranium-thorium fuel pins fraction in the core and the discharge fuel burnup is estimated. The result shows that larger fraction of uranium pins is better for the FBR criticality while larger fraction of thorium fuel pins and lower fuel burnup give higher 233U production rate.

Influence of void fraction change on plutonium and minor actinides recycling in BWR with equilibrium burnup	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	COE-INES 2nd International Symposium on Innovative Nuclear Energy Systems for Sustainable Development of the World	NOV 26-30, 2006	Yokohama, JAPAN	COE-INES, Tokyo Inst Technol, Res Lab Nucl Reactors, Tokyo Inst Technol, Ctr Res Innovat Nucl Energy Syst, Atom Energy Soc Japan		void fraction; equilibrium burnup; plutonium; minor actinides; BWR	FUEL-CYCLES	A study on the influence of void fraction change on plutonium and minor actinides recycling in standard boiling water reactor (BWR) with equilibrium burnup model has been conducted. We considered the equilibrium burnup model since it is a simple time independent burnup method that can handle all possible produced nuclides in any nuclear system. The uranium enrichment for the criticality of the reactor diminishes significantly for the plutonium and minor actinides recycling case compared to that of the once-through cycle of BWR case. This parameter decreases much lower with the increasing of the void fraction. A similar propensity was also shown in the required natural uranium per annum. The annual required natural uranium was calculated by assuming that the uranium concentration in the tail of the enrichment plant is 0.25 w%. The amount of loaded fuel reduces slightly with the increment of the void fraction for plutonium and minor recycling in BWR. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A coupled reactor which consists of two pulse cores with highly enriched metallic uranium and a subcritical thermal laser module with highly enriched metallic uranium is one of the reactors for nuclear-pumped laser. In this paper, criticality analysis of a coupled reactor which consists of pulse cores with 20% enriched metallic uranium and a subcritical thermal laser module with 20% enriched metallic uranium was performed by Monte Carlo calculation. The result of criticality analysis showed the following three points. First, a coupled reactor with 20% enriched metallic uranium can achieve criticality. Second, using eight pulse cores in axial direction is effective to achieve flattened axial power distribution in the laser module. Third, less than 20% of the energy released from fissions in the whole coupled reactor has the possibility to be converted to optical energy for a coupled reactor with 100% enriched uranium, and less than 7% for a coupled reactor with 20% enriched uranium.

The reactor is fueled by U-233 Th oxide and it has used the light water as moderator. Some characteristics such as spectrum, 77 value, criticality, breeding performance and number density are evaluated. Several power densities are evaluated in order to analyze its effect to the breeding performance. The 77 value of fissile U-233 obtains higher value than 2 which may satisfy the breeding capability especially for thermal reactor for all investigated MFR. The increasing enrichment and decreasing conversion ratio are more significant for MFR < 0.3. The required enrichment and conversion ratio do not change significantly caused by power density change for very tight lattice cell (MFR < 0.3), however. its strongly depends on the power density change for higher MFR (MFR >= 0.3). Breeding condition of all investigated power densities can be achieved for burnup >= 30 GW d/t at MFR = 0.3 and it requires about 3.5% of required U-233 enrichment. Number density of Pa-233 decreases significantly with decreasing power density which leads the reactor has better breeding performance because lower capture rate of Pa-233.

Thorium cycle shows some advantageous on higher breeding characteristics in thermal neutron spectrum region as shown in the Shippingport reactor and molten salt breeder reactor (MSBR) project. In the present study, the feasibility of large and small water cooled thorium breeder reactors is investigated under equilibrium conditions where the reactors are fueled by U-233 -Th oxide and they adopts light water coolant as moderator. The key properties such as required enrichment, breeding capability, and initial fissile inventory are evaluated. The conversion ratio and fissile inventory ratio (FIR) are used for evaluating breeding performance. The results show the feasibility of breeding for small and large reactors. The breeding performance increases with increasing power output and lower power density. The small reactor may achieve the breeding condition when the fuel pellets' power density of about 22.5 W/cm(3) and burnup of about 20 GWd/t. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Their achievable cycle thermal efficiencies are revealed to be 40%, 34% and 42% levels for the heat source outlet coolant temperature of 480 degrees C, respectively, if no other restriction is imposed. In the current technology, however, low temperature divertor heat source is included. In this actual case, the steam turbine system and the S-CO2 turbine system were compared in the light of cycle efficiency and plant cost. The values of cycle efficiency were 37.7% and 36.4% for the steam cycle and S-CO2 cycle, respectively, The construction cost was estimated by means of component volume. The volume became 16,590 m(3) and 7240 m(3) for the steam turbine system and S-CO2 turbine system, respectively. In addition, separation of permeated tritium from the coolant is much easier in S-CO2 than in H2O. Therefore, the S-CO2 turbine system is recommended to the fusion reactor system than the steam turbine system. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
