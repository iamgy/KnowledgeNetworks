Recent progresses in tritium radioecology and dosimetry	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				SOIL	In this paper, some aspects of recent progress in tritium radioecology and dosimetry are presented, with emphasis on atmospheric releases to terrestrial ecosystems. The processes involved in tritium transfer through the environment are discussed, together with the current status of environmental tritium models. Topics include the deposition and reemission of HT and HTO, models for the assessment of routine and accidental HTO emissions, a new approach to modeling the dynamics of tritium in mammals, the dose consequences of tritium releases and aspects of human dosimetry. The need for additional experimental data is identified, together with the attributes that would be desirable in the next generation of tritium codes.

Determination of the non exchangeable-organically bound tritium (NE-OBT) fraction in tree leaf samples collected around a nuclear research center	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				ENVIRONMENTAL-SAMPLES; LEVEL; HTO	Tritium exists in environmental samples in three forms: (i) Tissue Free Water Tritium (TFWT) and associated with the organic matter (OBT) under two forms; (d) bound to oxygen and nitrogen atoms into the material (E-OBT); (iii) bound to carbon atoms into the material (NE-OBT). The developed analytical procedure allows obtaining accurate and reproducible information for the various tritium fraction determinations. Aiming to follow the distribution and the integration of NE-OBT in the vicinity of a nuclear research centre down to environmental level the analytical procedure was optimized to reduce possible contamination during critical stages such as the E-OBT elimination. Therefore, a new process using steam was designed and investigated leading to promising results. A broad study was initiated to study potential impact of tritium on tree leaves sampled in the vicinity of a nuclear research centre within a radius of about 20 km. Moreover both plane tree and oak leaves have been sampled to establish the NE-OBT mapping. Therefore, for several locations they were sampled twofold for comparison. Appropriate statistical tests allow assessing that the type of tree does not influence the NE-OBT integration in our experimental conditions.

HTO and OBT concentrations in a wetland ecosystem	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				TRITIUM	Tritiated water (HTO) and organically bound tritium (OBT) concentrations in the non-human biota inhabiting Duke Swamp were measured during the 2005 growing season. Samples of surface water, soil, plants, precipitation, wild animals and air moisture were collected from 2005 May to October at five locations in the swamp and analyzed for their tritium content. HTO concentrations in air moisture decreased with height since the tritium source is in the ground. Soil HTO concentrations were not closely related to the concentrations in nearby surface water and the HTO concentration in balsam fir needles showed no clear pattern with height. HTO concentrations in moss, grass and alder leaves decreased in September, which is the time when metabolic activity is reduced. OBT concentrations in a given compartment showed less variation than the HTO concentrations in that compartment. The OBT/HTO ratio was approximately one for soil and less than one for plants, with the exception of lichen. The OBT/HTO ratio in most wild animals was also less than one, but increased to more than 2.0 for mice. Although the tritium concentrations varied substantially in space and time in Duke Swamp, the fact that OBT/HTO <1 for most compartments suggests that equilibrium conditions hold locally.	[Kim, S.

Organically bound tritium in the environment: First investigation of environmental survey in the vicinity of a French research centre	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				HTO; LICHENS; PLANTS; OBT	This paper deals with the experimentation made on different plants such as lichens, trees and lettuces exposed to HT and HTO throughout their lives. These experiments included, in the same time, consideration of meteorological data, measurement of tritium diffusion, characterization of the tritium transfer into biological materials, and dose estimation through the food chain. Works on lichens collected around the site have confirmed previous results quoted in the literature in regards to OBT levels. However, because of their potential of pollutants accumulation and the difficulty to date them, lichens can not be chosen as bio-indicators. Measurements carried out on annual rings of trees have shown the related evolutions in time of the OBT levels and the tritium releases of the Valduc Centre. These measures have underlined the possibility to reveal past contamination by OBT analysis around the centre in good correlation with the atmospheric discharge. The results obtained on lettuces cultivated into the site near a source of tritium appeared as very promising. A global conversion rate from tissue free water tritium to OBT was evaluated to 0.20 - 0.24 %.h(-1) in average on the whole growing period, corresponding to the order of magnitude given for many vegetables in the literature.

Experimental investigation of buried tritium in plant and animal tissues	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					Buried exchangeable tritium appears as part of organically bound tritium (OBT) in the traditional experimental determination of OBT Since buried tritium quickly exchanges with hydrogen atoms in the body following ingestion, assuming that it is part of OBT rather than part of tritiated water (HTO) could result in a significant overestimate of the ingestion dose. This paper documents an experimental investigation into the existence, amount and significance of buried tritium in plant and fish samples. OBT concentrations in the samples were determined in the traditional way and also following denaturing with five chemical solutions that break down large molecules and expose buried tritium to exchange with free hydrogen atoms. A comparison of the OBT concentrations before and after denaturing, together with the concentration of HTO in the supernatant obtained after denaturing, suggests that buried OBT may exist but makes up less than 5% of the OBT concentration in plants and at most 20% of the OBT concentration in fish. The effects of rinse time and rinse water volumes were investigated to optimize the removal of exchangeable OBT from the samples.	[Kim, S. B.; Workman, W. J. G.; Davis, P.

The data observed were presented in scenarios for model prediction of temporal change of HTO and OBT concentrations in Barnes mussels (Elliptio complanata). In the Uptake Scenario, mussels were transplanted from a site with background tritium concentrations into a lake, which has historically received tritium inputs over time from upgradient waste management areas Another data set was presented in the Depuration Scenario for model prediction of the temporal decrease in HTO and OBT concentrations in the mussels following transplantation from the lake into another lake with significantly lower tritium levels. The model simulation was able to reproduce the observation that the amount of hydrogen taken from sediment was very small compared with that taken from lake water.

This study aimed at giving practical technical information to decision-makers. Three scenarios with different meteorological conditions were modeled. The objective of this paper is to give the main information about transfer and impact, evaluate uncertainties in models/assessments and so help to set countermeasures. From the results of this exercise, reference activity values for countermeasures can be discussed. All pathways and chemical forms (HTO-HT-OBT) are considered.

Ring; Raskob, Wolfgang			Historical doses to the public from routine and accidental releases of tritium - Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 1953-2005	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					Throughout fifty-three years of operations, an estimated 29,300 TBq of tritium have been released to the atmosphere at the Livermore site of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; about 75% of this was released accidentally as gaseous tritium in 1965 and 1970. Routine emissions contributed slightly more than 3,700 TBq gaseous tritium and about 2,800 TBq tritiated water vapor to the total. Mean annual doses (with 95% confidence intervals) to the most exposed member of the public were calculated for all years using the same model and the same assumptions. Because time-dependent tritium models require detailed meteorological data that were unavailable for the large releases, ingestionlinhalation dose ratios were derived from experience with UFOTRI. Even with assumptions to assure that doses would not be underestimated, all doses from routine and accidental releases were below the level (3.6 mSv) at which adverse health effects have been documented, and most were below the current regulatory limit of 100 mu Sv per year from releases to the atmosphere.

The major chemical forms of atmospheric tritium are water (HTO), hydrogen (HT) and methane (CH3T). Average tritium concentrations of HTO, HT and CH3T observed from January 2003 to March 2006 were 9.0 mBq/m(3), 9.0 mBq/m(3) and 2.0 mBq/m(3), respectively. To examine about the systematic error of the air sampling device, we cross-checked with the sampling device of Kumamoto University. The values obtained with both devices were almost consistent. The HTO concentration principally depends on humidity in air The HTO concentration in the collected water and the HT concentration tend to show seasonal variation. The atmospheric tritium levels measured at Toki were consistent comparing with another environmental values measured in Japan. The present atmospheric tritium monitoring would be useful for safety consideration.

The monitoring program consists of tritium activity concentration measurement in sea water and precipitation from Black Sea Coast between April 2005 and April 2006 The sampling points were spread over the Danube-Black Sea Canal - before the locks Agigea and Navodari, and Black Sea along the coast to the Bulgarian border. The average tritium concentration in sea water collected from the sampling locations had the value of 11.1 +/- 2.1 TU close to tritium concentration in precipitation. Although an operating nuclear power plant exists in the monitored area, the values of tritium concentration in two locations are slightly higher than those recorded elsewhere. To conclude, it could be emphasized that until now, Cernavoda NPP did not had any influence on the tritium concentration of the Black Sea Shore.

Nuclear power stations, nuclear reprocessing plants and fusion facilities are observed as a further occurrence source. Then, in order to appraise the influence of nuclear facilities and long distance transport from the continent where tritium level is relatively high, it is necessary to investigate background levels of tritium. Tritium concentrations of 34 river waters and 6 lake waters in Japan were determined by low background liquid scintillation measurement system combined with the electrolysis using solidpolymer electrolyte. Tritium concentrations of river and lake water were 0.36-2.66 Bq/l (average 1.06 +/- 0.60 Bq/l) and 0.48-1.43 Bq/l (average 0.81 +/- 0.37 Bq/l), respectively. The entire mean value was 1.03 +/- 0.57 Bq/l. This mean value equals 43% of the mean value which was measured in 1982. It was possible to calculate 11 years as an apparent half-life.

Seasonal variability of tritium and ion concentrations in rain at Kumamoto, Japan and back-trajectory analysis of air mass	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				FUKUOKA	Tritium and major ion concentrations in rain were analyzed in Kumamoto, Japan between 2001 and 2006 to examine present tritium concentration and seasonal variation. The average tritium concentration was 0.36 +/- 0.19 Bq/L (n=104) and higher tritium concentrations were observed in spring than the other seasons. Among the ions, non-sea-salt (nss) SO42- showed higher concentration in winter while other ions did not show marked increase in winter. Based on the back-trajectory analyses of air masses, the increase in tritium concentrations in spring arises from downward movement of naturally produced tritium from stratosphere to troposphere, while the increase of the nss-SO42- concentrations in winter is due to long range transport Of pollutants from China to Japan.

Sample and standard waters were simultaneously enriched by connecting two electrolytic cells in series. The sample water was first enriched using a commercially available apparatus with a large electrolytic current of 50 A until the volume in the sample water was reduced to approximately one fifth of the original volume. This "two-stage electrolysis" enrichment was applied to coastal seawaters from the Aomori prefecture. Tritium concentrations, ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 Bq/L, were found, with a measurement error (i.e. a statistical error of one sigma) of ca. 10% of the obtained values.

Tritium emission reduction at Darlington Tritium Removal Facility using a Bubbler System	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					Ontario Power Generation Nuclear (OPGN) has a 4 x 880 MWe CANDU nuclear station at its Darlington Nuclear Division located in Bowmanville. The station operates a Tritium Removal Facility (TRF) to reduce and maintain low tritium levels in the Moderator and Heat Transport heavy water systems of Ontario's CANDU fleet by extracting, concentrating, immobilizing and storing as a metal tritide. Minimizing tritium releases to the environment is of paramount importance to ensure that dose to the public is as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) and to maintain credibility with the Public. Tritium is removed from the Cryogenic Distillation System to the Tritium Immobilization System (TIS) glove box via a transfer line that is protected by a rupture disc and relief valve. An overpressure event in 2003 had caused the rupture disc to blow, resulting in the release of a significant quantity of elemental tritium into the relief valve discharge line, which ties into the contaminated exhaust system. As a result of a few similar events occurring over a number of years of TRF operation, the released elemental tritium would have been converted to tritium oxide in the presence of a stagnant moist air environment in the stainless steel discharge line. A significant amount of tritium oxide hold-up in the discharge line was anticipated. To minimize any further releases to the environment, a Bubbler System was designed to remove and recover the tritium from the discharge line. This paper summarizes the results of several Bubbler recovery runs that were made over a period of a month. Approximately 3500 Ci of tritium oxide and 230 Ci of elemental tritium were removed and collected. The tritium contained in the water produced from the Bubbler system was later safely recovered in the station's downgraded D2O clean-up and recovery system.

Study of tritium in municipal solid waste leachate and gas	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				LANDFILL	It has become increasingly clear in the last few years that the vast majority of municipal solid waste landfills produce leachate that contains elevated levels of tritium. The authors recently conducted a study of landfills in New York and New Jersey and found that the mean concentration of tritium in the leachate from ten municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills was 33,800 pCi/L with a peak value of 192,000 pCi/L A 2003 study in California reported a mean tritium concentration of 99, 000 pCi/L with a peak value of 304, 000 pCi/L. Studies in Pennsylvania and the UK produced similar results. The USEPA MCL for tritium is 20,000 pCi/L. Tritium is also manifesting itself as landfill gas and landfill gas condensate. Landfill gas condensate samples from landfills in the UK and California were found to have tritium concentrations as high as 54,400 and 513,000 pCi/L, respectively. The tritium found in MSW leachate is believed to derive principally from gaseous tritium lighting devices used in some emergency exit signs, compasses, watches, and even novelty items, such as "glow stick" key chains. This study reports the findings of recent surveys of leachate from a number of municipal solid waste landfills, both open and closed, from throughout the United States and Europe. The study evaluates the human health and ecological risks posed by elevated tritium levels in municipal solid waste leachate and landfill gas and the implications to their safe management. We also assess the potential risks posed to solid waste management facility workers exposed to tritium-containing waste materials in transfer stations and other solid waste management facilities.

Tritium behavior intentionally released in the room	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				VENTILATED ROOM; FUSION-REACTOR; DETRITIATION; ATMOSPHERE; SIMULATION; CAISSON; SAFETY	To construct a fusion reactor with high safety and acceptability, it is necessary to establish and to ensure tritium safe handling technology. Tritium should be well-controlled not to be released to the environment excessively and to prevent workers from excess exposure. It is especially important to grasp tritium behavior in the final confinement area, such as the room and/or building. In order to obtain data for actual tritium behavior in a room and/or building, a series of intentional Tritium Release Experiments (TREs) were planned and carried out within a radiologically controlled area (main cell) at Tritium System Test Assembly (TSTA) in Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) under US-JAPAN collaboration program. These experiments were carried out three times. In these experiments, influence of a difference in the tritium release point and the amount of hydrogen isotope for the initial tritium behavior in the room were suggested Tritium was released into the main cell at TSTA/LANL. The released tritium reached a uniform concentration about 30 similar to 40 minutes in all the experiments. The influence of the release point and the amount of hydrogen isotope were not found to be important in these experiments. The experimental results for the initial tritium behavior in the room were also simulated well by the modified three-dimensional eddy flow analysis code FLOW-3D.

The safety systems in the TPL have operated with tritium since March 1988. The amount of tritium held in the TPL was 13 PBq in March 2007. The average tritium concentration in a stream from a stack of the TPL to the environment was 6.0 x 10(-3) Bq/cm(3) and is 1/100 smaller than that of the regulatory value for the concentration of HTO in the air in Japan. Safe operation with tritium has been demonstrated. A set of failure data for several main components of the TPL was also obtained as valuable data for a fusion tritium facility.

Scientific issues in radiation dose reconstruction	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						dose reconstruction; dosimetry, external; dosimetry, internal; nuclear workers	ATOMIC-BOMB SURVIVORS; BIOASSAY DATA; EXPOSURE; UNCERTAINTY; PLUTONIUM; MORTALITY; CANCER	Stakeholders have raised numerous issues regarding the scientific basis of radiation dose reconstruction for compensation. These issues can be grouped into three broad categories: data issues, dosimetry issues, and compensation issues. Data issues include demographic data of the worker, changes in site operations over time (both production and exposure control), characterization of episodic vs. chronic exposures, and the use of coworker data. Dosimetry issues include methods for assessment of ambient exposures, missed dose, unmonitored dose, and medical x-ray dose incurred as a condition of employment. Specific issues related to external dose include the sensitivity, angular and energy dependence of personal monitors, exposure geometries, and the accompanying uncertainties. Those related to internal dose include sensitivity of bioassay methods, uncertainties in biokinetic models, appropriate dose coefficients, and modeling uncertainties. Compensation issues include uncertainties in the risk models and use of the 99(th) percentile of the distribution of probability of causation for awarding compensation. A review of the scientific literature and analysis of each of these issues distinguishes factors that play a major role in the compensation decision from those that do not.

J	Rollins, EM				Rollins, Eugene M.			Ambient environmental profile for the Savannah River Site	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						dose reconstruction; emissions, atmospheric; environmental assessments; nuclear workers		One of the steps that has been taken to expedite the radiation dose reconstruction process is the development of "site profiles." These reports, one of which has been prepared for each of the major U.S. Department of Energy nuclear sites, include detailed assessments of the dose rates at a given site due to on-site exposures. Presented in this paper is a summary of the development of the ambient environmental dose profile for the Savannah River Site (SRS) for specific time periods from 1951-2001. Internal doses were estimated based on the radionuclide concentrations in the atmosphere due to individual facility releases and the resuspension of radioactive materials from the soil. External doses were estimated on the basis of releases of noble gases and contributions from ambient background radiation, which had been elevated due to various on-site activities. Although the annual environmental reports for the SRS served as a major resource for this effort, considerable work was required to access these data in terms of the accompanying dose rates. This was due, for example, to the confounding effects of nuclear weapons testing, lack of spatial and radionuclide resolution, and insensitivity of sampling methods to radionuclides important to dose. To overcome these problems, methods were developed to use well-documented source terms from reports published by others, coupled with historical meteorological records, to estimate specific airborne concentrations for radionuclides such as H-3, Ar-41, I-131, U-234, U-235, U-238, Pu-238, Pu-239, and Pu-240. Airborne concentration calculations included spatial and release height considerations for source terms at eight different production facilities. The resulting estimates then were used to derive annual intakes based on an assumed individual breathing rate of 2,400 m(3) y(-1). Annual intakes resulting from resuspension of radionuclides from soil were based on maximum soil concentrations located in appropriate areas. This being accomplished, the estimated intakes and ambient radiation exposures were used to estimate the dose rates to major body organs of interest at specific time intervals.

Establishing bounding internal dose estimates for thorium activities at Rocky Flats	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						dose reconstruction; dose assessment; thorium; Th-232		As part of an evaluation of a Special Exposure Cohort petition filed on behalf of workers at the Rocky Flats Plant, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) was required to demonstrate that bounding values could be established for radiation doses due to the potential intake of all radionuclides present at the facility. The main radioactive elements of interest at Rocky Flats were plutonium and uranium, but much smaller quantities of several other elements, including thorium, were occasionally handled at the site. Bounding potential doses from thorium has proven challenging at other sites due to the early historical difficulty in detecting this element through urinalysis methods and the relatively high internal dose delivered per unit intake. This paper reports the results of NIOSH's investigation of the uses of thorium at Rocky Flats and provides bounding dose reconstructions for these operations. During this investigation, NIOSH reviewed unclassified reports, unclassified extracts of classified materials, material balance and inventory ledgers, monthly progress reports from various groups, and health physics field logbooks, and conducted interviews with former Rocky Flats workers. Thorium operations included: (1) an experimental metal forming project with 240 kg of thorium in 1960; (2) the use of pre-formed parts in weapons mockups; (3) the removal of Th-228 from U-233; (4) numerous analytical procedures involving trace quantities of thorium; and (5) the possible experimental use of thorium as a mold coating compound. The thorium handling operations at Rocky Flats were limited in scope, well-monitored and documented, and potential doses can be bounded.

Glass matrices for immobilizing nuclear waste containing molybdenum and phosphorus	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article								Vitrification has been selected in France as the process for immobilizing high-level waste arising from spent fuel reprocessing. Some high-level solutions generated by reprocessing legacy fuel contain high molybdenum concentrations. Molybdenum is known to be sparingly soluble in conventional borosilicate glass, and work is in progress to find suitable glass formulations for such waste. The results of a basic study to identify borosilicate glasses composition zones of potential interest are discussed. A vast composition range was investigated by defining a fine mesh. The limits considered to delimit the range of the study were intentionally extended to identify formulations such as SiO2-B2O3-Al2O3-Na2O-P2O5 that are of interest for vitrifying molybdenum-rich waste. Observation of more than 50 tested mixtures revealed two composition zones of potential interest. One forms a homogeneous glass after melting at 1300 degrees C and rapid cooling; the other vitreous material comprises unconnected microbeads uniformly dispersed in a borosilicate glass.

Fission product release and microstructure changes during laboratory annealing of a very high burn-up fuel specimen	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							UO2 NUCLEAR-FUEL; CROSS-SECTIONS; RIM-STRUCTURE; 100 MWD/KGHM; THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; GAS RELEASE; PWR-FUELS; IONIZATION; URANIUM; IRRADIATION	A commercial PWR fuel sample with a local burn-up of about 240 MWd/kgHM was annealed in a Knudsen cell mass spectrometer system with a heating rate of 10 K/min up to 2750 K at which temperature the sample was completely vaporized. The release of fission gases and fission products was studied as a function of temperature. In one of the runs the heating was interrupted successively at 900, 1500 and 1860 K and at each step a small fragment of the sample was examined by SEM and analysed by energy dispersive electron probe microanalysis. The release behaviour of volatile, gaseous and other less volatile fission products is presented and analysed with the EFFUS program and related to the structural changes of the fuel.

Kinetics of this reaction was compared in different conditions in the range of 443-550 degrees C. Using this molten salt solution, the redox potential of the Pu(III)/Pu couple at inert tungsten electrode was measured at 450 degrees C by electromotive force measurement and was found to be E'(O) = -2.76 V vs. the Cl-2(g)(1 atm)/Cl- reference electrode (molar fraction scale). Reaction between plutonium trichloricle and oxide ions was studied by potentiometric titration, using yttria stabilized electrodes. In our experimental conditions, the titration curves indicate the precipitation of the sesquioxide Pu2O3. The solubility product cologarithm calculated from these curves is found to be pK(s)(Pu2O3) = 22.8 +/- 1.1 (molality scale). Using the experimentally obtained values for E'(O), activity coefficient and pK(s) joined to the published thermodynamic data, the stability phase diagram of the Pu-O species was then drawn.

An indentation system for determination of viscoplastic stress-strain behavior of small metal volumes before and after irradiation	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							SPHERICAL INDENTATION; MATERIAL PARAMETERS; BALL INDENTATION; FERRITIC/MARTENSITIC STEELS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; PART I; IDENTIFICATION; SPECIMENS; RADIATION; CURVES	The development of fusion materials for the first wall in future fusion reactors requires methods for the investigation of irradiation effects on the mechanical properties of materials which are only available in small volumes. Depth and force reading hardness measurement (or indentation) is one of the candidates that have the potential to extract valuable information on the stress-strain behavior of a material. A modified commercial indentation device installed in a hot cell of a fusion materials laboratory (FML) in combination with a neural network based analysis method allows identifying the material parameters of a unified viscoplasticity model with nonlinear isotropic and kinematic hardening from small metal specimens. By investigation of the same material before and after irradiation the method provides the possibility to separate irradiation effects on modulus, hardening and viscous behavior.

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the actinide concentration (simulated with cerium), the fabrication conditions and the properties of the produced powders on the compactibility and sinterability of the final products. The (Th1-xCex)O-2 powders with ceria concentration varying from 5 to 50 mol% were synthesized by co-precipitation method. The pellets were then compacted from calcined and ground powders at pressures varying from 250 to 750 MPa. The produced pellets had a homogenous grain size and sintered densities of 0.88% to 0.95% TD, respectively. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Phase study in the Na-Sr-U-O system: Characterization of new phase	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							URANATES; DIFFRACTION; STRONTIUM; NEUTRON	In continuation with the earlier work for phase studies of Rb-Sr-U-O and Cs-Sr-U-O systems, the subsolidus phase relations in Na-Sr-U-O quaternary system were determined at 850 degrees C in air atmosphere. A novel quaternary phase Na8Sr2U6O24 in the Na-Sr-U-O system was synthesized by heating the respective oxides at 850 degrees C in air. XRD data of Na8Sr2U6O24 was indexed on a cubic system with lattice parameter a = 0.8326 nm and was found isostructural with K8Sr2U6O24 and Rb8Sr2U6O24. A pseudo-ternary phase diagram of Na2O-SrO-UO3 was drawn using the new quaternary compound and various phase fields were established by X-ray powder diffraction analysis. The structure of Na8Sr2U6O24 was derived from the powder data and structural parameters were refined by the Rietveld profile method. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The equilibrium fuel cycle burnup calculation has been performed. which is coupled with the cell calculation for this evaluation. The eta of U-233 shows its superiority over other fissile nuclides in (lie surveyed MFR ranges and always stays higher than 2.1, which indicates that the reactor has a breeding condition for a wide range of MFR. A breeding condition with a burnup comparable to that of a standard PWR or higher can be achieved by adopting a larger pin pap (1-6 mm), and a pin gap of about 2 mm can be used to achieve a breeding ratio (BR) of I. I. A feasible design region of the reactors, which fulfills the breeding, condition and negative void reactivity coefficient. has been found. A heavy-water-cooled PWR-type Th-U-233 fuel reactor can be designed as a breeder reactor with negative void coefficient.

Before fabricating the HCV. we fabricated a prototype that can process such a high capacity. From the analyses of some drawbacks of the prototype, we devised a couple of novel innovations Such as a folding-type mesh, vibrators, and mixing blades. We used the Stokes, equation to theoretically determine the most reasonable flux so as not to cause U3O8 powder dispersion during oxidation. Compared with the results of the prototype, we showed that both the recovery rate of the U3O8 powders and the oxidation rate of: the UO2 pellets of the HCV were remarkably increased due to the folding-type mesh, vibrator and mixing blades, and the temperature was controlled stably in spite of the exothermic reaction due to the mixing blades along with the rotational mesh. Also, no powder was dispersed through the exhaust line of the HCV within the air flux calculated using the Stokes equation. The experimental results of this study are valuable in terms of being the first vol-oxidation of tens of kg in the world. Based on this study, a more efficient and higher capacity vol-oxidizer is expected to be developed.

A mechanistic model of porosity growth under annealing conditions for light water reactor (LWR) UO2 fuel with typical stereological parameters of the HBS has been developed. The model takes into account both multipore and Surface interactions that lead to fission gas release from the HBS porosity. We have applied the model to an HBS annealing experiment and found that reasonable agreement with the experimental gas release Curve can be achieved for a vacancy diffusion enthalpy close to that measured experimentally. A comparison of the model behaviours at different pore growth rates is performed. We found that the model exhibits Porosity evolution characteristics independent of the growth rate, specifically the existence of a maximum porosity, a continuous gas release. and a decreasing pore number density. A general comparison between the model results and in-pile data indicates that LIP to 250 MWd/kgU, most of the gas is retained within the HBS.

J	Sasaki, T; Gunji, Y; Iida, T				Sasaki, Tomozo; Gunji, Yasuyoshi; Iida, Takao			Theoretical basis for measuring small radon diffusion coefficients for a radium-bearing porous material generated by precipitation of iron (III) hydroxide	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						radon diffusion; radon diffusion coefficient; uranium-bearing waste; radon diffusion measurement		In order to remove a very small amount of a certain substance (such as radium) which is contained in a solution in a dissolved or suspended form, iron nitrate or iron chloride is often used to separate the substance as a precipitate. Such a precipitate consists of very small polycrystals of iron (III) hydroxide and is porous and contains much moisture. The polycrystals have very complicated forms and link with each other irregularly. In this precipitate, radon diffuses so slowly that measuring its diffusion coefficients is very difficult. However if the small amount of the substance in the Solution is radiurn, it is possible to measure the radon diffusion coefficients by putting the precipitate in a can and measuring the amount of emanated radon in the can. The present paper established a theoretical basis for this measurement and applied it to a simulated ferrous uranium-bearing waste.

Tritium enrichment from aqueous solutions using cryosublimation of mono- and polysaccharides	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							WATER	Cryosublimation is one technique, which allows the accumulation of tritium from aqueous solutions using certain chemical compounds. After studying several inorganic compounds such as zeolites and metal salts,(1) as well as some humic substances,(2) we have now investigated several mono-and polysaccharides, such as glucose, maltose, galactose, starch, agar, and gelatine. Except for starch all of the above mentioned compounds showed a clear enrichment of tritium. The highest value was reached for Agartine, which gave an enrichment factor of 6.2. Since mono-and polysaccharides form weak hydrogen bonds, these results prove again our theory that tritium is preferably accumulated in exchangeable hydrogen bonds.

Prompt gamma activation analysis (PGAA) and short-lived neutron activation analysis (NAA) applied to the characterization of legacy materials	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								Without quality historical records that provide the composition of legacy materials, the elemental and/or chemical characterization of such materials requires a manual analytical strategy that may expose the analyst to unknown toxicological hazards. In addition, much of the existing legacy inventory also incorporates radioactivity, and, although radiological composition may be determined by various nuclear-analytical methods, most importantly, gamma-spectroscopy, current methods of chemical characterization still require direct sample manipulation, thereby presenting special problems with broad implications for both the analyst and the environment. Alternately, prompt gamma activation analysis (PGAA) provides a 'single-shot' in-situ, non-destructive method that provides a complete assay of all major entrained elemental constituents.(1-3) Additionally, neutron activation analysis (NAA) using short-lived activation products complements PGAA and is especially useful when NAA activation surpasses the PGAA in elemental sensitivity.

In this study, the extraction of uranium was performed from various aqueous matrices with different concentrations of HNO3, LiNO3, and AHA. Extraction of uranium increases with increasing both initial HNO3 and total nitrate concentration. UV-VIS spectrophotometry confirmed that AHA is involved in the complex of uranium with TBP.

Neutron activation analysis applications at the Savannah River Site using an isotopic neutron source	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								NAA using Cf-252 is used to address important areas of applied interest of the Savanah River Site (SRS). Sensitivity needs for many of the applications are not severe; analyses are accomplished using a 21 mg Cf-252 NAA facility. Because NAA allows analysis of bulk samples, it offers strong advantages for samples in difficult-to-digest matrices when its sensitivity is sufficient. Following radiochemical separation with stable carrier addition, chemical yields for a number of methods are determined by neutron activation of the stable carrier. In some of the cases where no suitable stable carriers exist, the source has been used to generate radioactive tracers to yield separations.	[DiPrete, D. P.; DiPrete, C. C.; Sigg, R.

Activities of Sr-90, Cs-137, Pu-238, Pu239+240, 241Am and Cm-244 were determined. It was established that the main source of the revealed actinides and fission products was an impurity of natural thorium and uranium in TC source material on the level of several tenths of ppm. Impurity analysis of TC source material was performed by neutron activation analysis (NAA) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Fission product and transuranium element activities measured were compared with the results of prognostic calculations performed with the help of the NAAPRO code.	[Berlizov, A. N.; Malyuk, I.

An analysis scheme involving a fairly small number of separations, dilutions, and measurement methods was used to generate information on 74 isotopes in two spent-fuel samples of > 70 GWd/MTU burnup. Some of the measured isotopes are of high interest for burnup-credit evaluations and had not been reported previously for high-burnup fuels.	[Sullivan, V. S.; Bowers, D. L.; Clark, M. A.; Graczyk, D.

Radionuclide-aided technique in a field study on plant root bioactivity	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								An instrumentation and a tracer technique has been employed for the investigation of root bioactivity in plants with injected Se-75 in a study carried out under field conditions. The investigation was based on a previously developed instrumentation and on findings that Se-75 is preferably transferred within the root system to the active tissues of the injected plants. The root bioactivity was investigated in corn and sunflower as subjected to different fertilization and irrigation treatments. The pattern of root bioactivity varied with crop, time and treatment applied. The technique showed to be reliable and easy-to-use and the detection equipment scanned the radioactivity along the soil profile with good accuracy. The described method has proved to be a useful tool to study under field conditions the root response to variations in moisture and nutrient status in the soil.

The adsorption behavior of alkaline earth elements on tertiary pyridine resin was investigated using the methanol/nitric acid mixed solution, and the feasibility of strontium separation was studied. We found that strontium can be completely separated from other alkaline earth elements and alkali metal elements using the tertiary pyridine resin. The extraction of strontium from coral sample was demonstrated.

Potential method for measurement of CO2 leakage from underground sequestration fields using radioactive tracers	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								Reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the environment may avert the effects of global warming. One method to control CO2 emissions is to sequester it underground. Leakage from storage must be minimized for long-term control. Detection of leaks decreases the amount of CO2 released from storage, so onsite monitoring must be performed over large areas. Spiking the injected CO2 with an isotopic tracer can improve ground leak detection using fewer sampling stations, with greater accuracy than CO2 sensors and no interference from radon gas. The relative merits of sorbent materials, isotopic tracers, detection methods and potential interferences will be discussed.	[Bachelor, P. P.; McIntyre, J. I.; Amonette, J. E.; Hayes, J.

Separation and purification of Cf-249 and Cm-245	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								There is a need to provide radioactivity standards of the higher actinides in support of both decommissioning and remediation activities as well as routine environmental analysis. In the case Cf-249, this will provide a useful calibration nuclide for both alpha-and gamma-spectrometry as well as improving knowledge of the decay scheme for this nuclide. There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that the chemical yield of americium and curium may differ in radiochemical analysis. Thus, a chemical yield tracer of Cm-245 may help to resolve this issue and will be suitable for both, suitable for use as a chemical yield tracer for both alpha-particle spectrometry and mass spectrometry. An aged source of Cf-249 was used as the source material for the separation of these two nuclides by cation-exchange, using 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-propanoic acid at controlled pH as an eluant, Cf-249 being eluted before the Cm-245 daughter. The purity of both nuclides was measured by gamma-ray spectrometry.	[Jerome, S. M.; Pearce, A.

Use of electrodeposition for sample preparation and rejection rate prediction for assay of electroformed ultra high purity copper for Th-232 and U-238 prior to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP/MS)	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								The search for neutrinoless double beta decay in Ge-76 has driven the need for ultra-low background Ge detectors shielded by electroformed copper of ultra-high radiopurity (< 0.1 mu Bq/kg). Although electrodeposition processes are almost sophisticated enough to produce copper of this purity, to date there are no methods sensitive enough to assay it. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP/MS) can detect thorium and uranium at femtogram levels, however, this assay is hindered by high copper concentrations in the sample. Electrodeposition of copper samples removes copper from the solution while selectively concentrating thorium and uranium contaminants to be assayed by ICP/MS. Spiking Th-232 and U-238 into the plating bath simulates low purity copper and allows for the calculation of the electrochemical rejection rate of thorium and uranium in the electroplating system. This rejection value will help to model plating bath chemistry.	[Hoppe, E. W.; Aalseth, C. E.; Brodzinski, R.; Day, A. R.; Farmer, O. T.; Hossbach, T. W.; McIntyre, J. I.; Miley, H. S.; Mintzer, E.

Radon and progeny alpha-particle energy analysis using nuclear track methodology	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							SPECTROSCOPY; CR-39; DETECTORS	A preliminary procedure for alpha-energy analysis of radon and its progeny using nuclear track methodology (NTM) is described in this paper. The method is based on the relationship between alpha-particle energies deposited in polycarbonate material (CR-39) and the track size developed after a well-established chemical etching process. Track geometry, defined by parameters such as major or minor diameters, track area and overall track length, is shown to correlate with alpha-particle energy over the range 6.00 MeV (Po-218) to 7.69 MeV (Po-214). Track features are measured and the data analyzed automatically using a digital imaging system and commercial PC software. Examination of particle track diameters in CR-39 exposed to environmental radon reveals a multi-modal distribution. Locations of the maxima in this distribution are highly correlated with alpha-particle energies of radon daughters, and the distributions are sufficiently resolved to identify the radioisotopes. This method can be useful for estimating the radiation dose from indoor exposure to radon and its progeny.	[Espinosa, G.; Golzarri, J.

Diffusion coefficients for uranium, cesium and strontium in unsaturated prairie soil	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							TRANSPORT; FISSION; ACTINIDE	Soil samples were collected at the site of a 1951 leak from an underground storage tank of 6.7 liter of an aqueous solution of irradiated uranium. Laboratory simulations were conducted using irradiated and non-irradiated natural uranium metal, dissolved in acidic aqueous solutions and added to soil columns. Contaminant transport experiments were conducted for a period of 12 to 14 months, followed by sample analysis employing gamma-spectroscopy, neutron activation analysis and liquid scintillation counting. The concentration distributions of U, Cs and Sr found from the experiments were used to derive diffusion coefficients. The measured diffusion coefficients from the field samples were: for Cs-137, 3.0E-04 cm(2)center dot s(-1); for 238U, 1.8E-09 cm(2)center dot s(-1); and for Sr-90, 2.6E-09 cm(2)center dot s(-1). Corresponding values for the laboratory simulations were 5E-06, 3E-05 and 1.9E-05 cm(2)center dot s-(1), respectively.	[Sims, D. J.; Andrews, W. S.; Creber, K. A.
