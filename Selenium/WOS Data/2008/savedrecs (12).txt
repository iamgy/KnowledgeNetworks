J	Rana, MA				Rana, Mukhtar Ahmed			A new method for monitoring the radiation damage in nuclear waste containers using ion channelling	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							CERAMICS; PLUTONIUM; MODEL; GAN	Immobilizing nuclear wastes has been one of the most important challenges in nuclear technology. A method to quantify and monitor the radiation damage to waste immobilizing crystalline materials like zircon is proposed. This method will make use of proton/ion channelling measurements of the crystalline containment sample or test crystalline sample placed in the crystalline or amorphous containment of nuclear waste for a long time from years to a few decades and the mathematical method to determine the structure collapse rate of the containment material using channelling measurements. Implementation procedure of this method/technique for radiation damage measurement in nuclear waste container materials is described. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

High burn-up capability possibilities for a new beryllium moderated water cooled natural uranium reactor	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								A recently conceived nuclear reactor design is evaluated here for theoretical burn-up characteristics which might support Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) goals. This reactor uses natural uranium metal as fuel with beryllium moderation. The reactor also uses light water as a coolant. The reactor analysis in this work predicts the reactor to be capable of running at up to 4 GW-thermal for total burn-up values of approximately 1.4 x 10(3) GW-days. This is a very simple conceptual reactor design intended solely for very preliminary feasibility studies. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sodium sulfate as an eluant for concentrated solution of pertechnetate	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Tc-99m generator; sodium sulfate as an eluant; high specific volume activity Tc-99m		Fission molybdenum-99 based technetium-99m chromatography generators are the most widely employed generator systems in the field of diagnostic nuclear medicine. In the first week these generators provide high specific volume activity Na-99m TcO4, but in the second week the radioactive concentration of the eluate (Tc-99m) becomes <= 17% of that at the beginning of the first week. Low specific volume activity limits the clinical procedures (e.g. Tc-99m-DTPA for lung ventilation scanning, Tc-99m-sestamibi for myocardial perfusion studies, Tc-99m-ECD for brain imaging and Tc-99m-red cells for testicles) that can be performed at the beginning of the second week. To overcome such limitations sodium sulfate was used as an eluant, which provides > 80% of Tc-99m radioactivity in 2 nil solution, while 0.9% NaCl provides only 40-45% Tc-99m in first 2ml solution.

This approach has the advantages of ease of quantitative analysis, small sample size, an absence of mixed waste solvents, complete separation of U/Th isotopes, acceptable chemical yields and good energy resolution in the alpha spectrum. The procedure for analyzing alpha-emitting isotopes of uranium and thorium in geothermal water from Peito, Taiwan, is illustrated in detail. It involves sample pre-concentration, filtration and separation by highly selective extraction chromatographic resins, followed by electroplating and alpha-spectroscopy. The analytical results show a chemical recovery exceeding 55% for U and 65% for Th, respectively, under optimized conditions. The efficient and cost-effective use of recyclable columns makes the analytical methods simple, accurate, rapid, reliable and robust. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An analytical calculation of the peak efficiency for cylindrical sources perpendicular to the detector axis in gamma-ray spectrometry	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						gamma-peak efficiency; efficiency for linear sources; efficiency for cylindrical sources; self-attenuation of volume sources; HPGe detectors; radioactive waste drum	SOURCE GEOMETRY; VOLUME SAMPLES; POINT-SOURCE; ATTENUATION; CALIBRATION	An analytical expression for the so-called full-energy peak efficiency epsilon(E) for cylindrical source with perpendicular axis to an HPGe detector is derived, using point-source measurements. The formula covers different measuring distances, matrix compositions, densities and gamma-ray energies; the only assumption is that the radioactivity is homogeneously distributed within the source. The term for the photon self-attenuation is included in the calculation. Measurements were made using three different sized cylindrical sources of Am-241, Co-57,(CS)-C-137, Mn-54, and Co-60 with corresponding peaks of 59.5, 122, 662, 835, 1173, and 1332 keV, respectively, and one measurement of radioactive waste drum for 662, 1173, and 1332 keV.

In this paper, a simple analytical method using sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) combined with two-stage chromatographic separation and purification of Pu was developed based on the optimization and adaptation of the previously published method for marine samples with an emphasis on the study of the elimination of interferences for the analysis of freshwater lake sediments. A strong base anion-exchange resin (AG MP-1M) was used to purify Pu isotopes with concentrated HBr as the final eluent for Pu elution. The chemical yields were ca. 64% and the decontamination factor for U was ca. 10(5). The developed method was validated using a freshwater lake sediment reference material (SRM-4354) and a marine sediment reference material (IAEA-368), and applied to the determination of Pu isotopes in sediment samples of Lake Poyang, East China. For the analysis of certified reference materials, both Pu239+240 activity of 31.6mBqg(-1), and Pu-240/Pu-239 atom ratio of 0.033 for IAEA-368 were comparable to the certified value and/or literature values. As for SRM-4354, Pu239+240 activity of 3.90 mBqg(-1) agreed well with the certified value. However, the mean Pu-240/Pu-239 atom ratio of 0.144 was lower than those reported by other laboratories. This difference suggested that this material may be isotopically inhomogeneous.

Some possible evolutionary scenarios suggested by Cl-36 measurements in Guarani aquifer groundwaters	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Cl-36 measurements; rainwater; groundwater; mixing models; Guarani aquifer	MILK RIVER AQUIFER; U-234/U-238 ACTIVITY RATIOS; GREAT ARTESIAN BASIN; DISSOLVED URANIUM; OLD GROUNDWATER; SOUTH-AMERICA; SAO-PAULO; BRAZIL; AUSTRALIA; ALBERTA	The Guarani aquifer underlies 1.2 M km(2) in the Parana sedimentary basin of South America and is an important source of water for industry, agriculture, and domestic supplies. To determine the sustainability of this aquifer we need to understand the dynamics of the groundwater system. This paper describes the first Cl-36 measurements on aquifer groundwaters and some measurements on South American rainwaters, thought to be indicative of the recharge water. The results are compared to previous work in the region, including other radioisotope analyses. A simple model is developed, incorporating radioactive decay, allowing scenarios to be developed for mixing different waters at different mixing rates. Thus, mixing scenarios consistent with other hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical data could be assessed. A model that mixes fresh recharging waters with formational waters, that contain elevated chloride levels, but low (in situ) Cl-36 levels, can explain most of the results presented here. The expectation that rainwater samples would provide a good end-member for modelling recharge proved problematic, however. As a consequence, it is suggested that either: the recharge waters are not sourced from the same locations as the rains; that the current rainfall and fallout conditions were significantly different in the past; or that the low levels of chloride in rainfall may have allowed some contamination of the samples by old (Cl-36-free) chloride during the recharge process.

Computational-experimental studies of a facility for detecting fissile materials in airports	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								An approach to developing a facility for detecting and nondestructive monitoring of fissile materials is examined. The approach is based on the use of a pulsed neutron source and different moderators in which the time dependences of the characteristics of the neutron and photon fields are distinguished with the help of a digital technology for processing scintillation signals. The computational and experimental studies which were performed make it possible to substantiate the main parameters of a real customs facility, which can be used at an airport, for detecting fissile materials. It is impossible to conceal fissile materials by means of radiation-absorbing screens, for example, lead or cadmium screens. The use of a pulsed source of neutrons with a deuterium-deuterium synthesis reaction precludes any possible contamination of the territory of the airport even if the neutron source is deliberately destroyed.

Artificial neural net modeling of the radioactive contamination of the Techa River	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								To analyze the reasons for the high radioactive contamination of the Techa River in August 2004, when the (90)Sr content in the section line at the village of Muslyumovo exceeded 50 Bq/liter, the dynamics of the concentration of (90)Sr in Techa River water and the level of the reservoir V-11 were modeled using artificial neural nets. It is concluded that there exists a hidden factor, which is activated at definite times, substantial decreasing the water level in the reservoir V-11, and that cannot be explained on the basis of the precipitation-evaporation balance. The action of this factor is strongly associated with the change of the water flow rate in the left-bank channel. It is suggested that the high radioactive contamination of the Techa River in the summer of 2004 coinciding with the decrease of the water level in V-11, which cannot be explained by the precipitation-evaporation balance, are associated with a discharge of the contaminated water from V-11 into the left-bank bypass.

J	Krone, J				Krone, Juergen			What about Radioactive Waste Management in the Reorganization of the Russian Nuclear Industry?	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								Even in the light of rising government revenues, the expansion of the Russian nuclear industry cannot be considered on safe grounds as far as funding is concerned. Decisions about new investments depend on proof that nuclear power is by far more profitable than investments into the development of new gas fields. For a long time, the way in which the unsolved issues of radioactive waste management were to be integrated into the reorganization of the Russian nuclear industry was an open question. Current developments demonstrate the efforts made by the Rosatom management to establish a sound basis for the sustainable management of radioactive waste. In late June 2008, the committees of the Russian parliament started deliberations of the draft legislation introduced by Rosatom about the management of radioactive waste, which includes the legal prerequisites for a sustainable national waste management system. The government-operated waste management company, FGUP "RosRAO" (Sole Federal Government Enterprise, "Russian Radioactive Waste"), was founded as a Rosatom Subsidiary henceforth to be responsible also for the final storage of radioactive waste. Mainly recommendations of the R4.04/04, "Strategy Definition for Russian Federation NPP Back End Radioactive Waste Management, including Draft Legislation and Institutional Framework," Tacis project were taken up, which had been elaborated by a consortium of 6 West European waste management organizations in close cooperation with Russian experts from Rosatom. The analysis conducted is described in an outline of the present situation of radioactive waste management in Russia and the recommendations derived from it. In addition, the most recent steps towards building a sustainable government-operated management system for radioactive waste of the Russian nuclear industry are explained.

J	Schmidt, J; Fehling, N				Schmidt, Juergen; Fehling, Norbert			Nukem Assists Sogin in Spent Fuel Pool and Water Cleaning Efforts	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article								At the former EUREX reprocessing plant at Saluggia in Northern Italy a concrete spent fuel pool installation was in operation divided in 3 segments. The segments either contained fuel elements, miscellaneous metal components or have been used as transfer buffers for the transportation of spent fuel during the operation period of the EUREX facility. Its current operator SOGIN, the organization that recently consolidated the management of all nuclear liabilities in Italy under one roof, had decided to decontaminate and clean the fuel pool as a first step of a mid term strategy to decommission this installation. Based oil NUKEMs experience in cleaning and decommissioning of nuclear installations SOGIN contacted NUKEM and a four stage approach had been determined. Based oil a feasibility study, SOGIN placed a second order with NUKEM for the cleaning and decontamination of the fuel pool as a first step. Works of the second campaign, which started in November 2007 included the detailed cleanup and inspection of the walls and floors of the fuel pool in preparation for the drain down of the pool water with subsequent painting of the entire fuel pool surface area for residual contamination control.

J							Arbeitskreis Szenarienentwicklung	Paper of the Working Group Scenario Development: Human Intrusion into a Deep Geological Repository for Radioactive Waste	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								The safety of repositories for radioactive waste has to be proven in the so-called Safety Case. For this, potential developments of the repository system (scenarios) arc studied regarding their effects on safety. The derivation of scenarios is of essential importance for the Safety Case. Herein, potential disturbances of the repository system through future human actions, as human intrusion into a repository, have to be taken into account. Future human actions involved in safety considerations differ in the national and international frame to some extent considerably from each other. The deviations call be predominantly attributed to different disposal concepts, site situations, and regulations as well as country-specific perceptions. For the German disposal program the development of a mutual accepted technical basis concerning the handling of future human actions is desirable. Therefore. the,Scenario development" Working Group has elaborated a joint position, which focuses on essential aspects of the topic and comprise recommendations.

J	Heller, W				Heller, W.			New Safety Requirements in Repository Storage	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								On August 12, 2008. the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, and Nuclear Safety (BMU) publicized the draft "Safety Requirements in Repository Storage of Radioactive Waste Generating Heat." The reason given for the draft is that the "Safety Criteria for Final Storage of Radioactive Waste in a Mine" adopted by the then Federal Ministry of the Interior in 1983 no longer,were Lip the present state of the art. The draft is Subdivided into nine chapters: "Objectives," "Scope," "Definitions and Explanations," "Purpose and General Goals of Protection," "Safety Principles," "Stepwise Optimization," "Critetia of Protection," "Proof of Safety," and "Repository Design." The BMU draft of the safety requirements is to be discussed at the international symposium on final storage in Berlin oil October 30 to November 1, 2008 planned by the BMU. However, it should also be deliberated by the expert agencies. One of the questions to be examined is whether new requirements as contained in the rules now under discussion would still be in line with the advancing state of the art when a repository would be commissioned around 2030 at the earliest.									0	0	0	0	0	INFORUM VERLAGS-VERWALTUNGSGESELLSCHAFT MBH	BERLIN	ROBERT-KOCH-PLATZ 4, BERLIN, 10115, GERMANY	1431-5254			ATW-INT J NUCL POWER	ATW-Int.

Small quantities of tritium are released in routine regulated effluents as liquid water and as water vapor. Tritium has become a focus of attention at commercial nuclear power plants in recent years due to inadvertent, low-level, chronic releases arising from routine maintenance operations and from component failures. Tritium has been observed in groundwater in the vicinity of stations. The nuclear industry has undertaken strong proactive corrective measures to prevent recurrence, and continues to eliminate emission sources through its singular focus on public safety and environmental stewardship. This paper will discuss: production mechanisms for tritium, transport mechanisms from the reactor through plant, systems to the environment, examples of routine effluent releases, offsite doses, basic groundwater transport and geological issues, and recent nuclear industry environmental and legal ramifications.

Darlington tritium removal facility and station upgrading plant dynamic process simulation	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					Ontario Power Generation Nuclear (OPGN) has a 4 x 880 MWe CANDU nuclear station at its Darlington Nuclear Division located in Bowmanville. The station has been operating a Tritium Removal Facility (TRF) and a D2O station Upgrading Plant (SUP) since 1989. Both facilities were designed with a Distributed Control System (DCS) and programmable logic controllers (PLC) for process control. This control system was replaced with a DCS only, in 1998. A dynamic plant simulator was developed for the Darlington TRF (DTRF) and the SUP, as part of the computer control system replacement. The simulator was used to test the new software, required to eliminate the PLCs. The simulator is now used for operator training and testing of process control software changes prior to field installation. Dynamic simulation will be essential for the ITER isotope separation system, where the process is more dynamic than the relatively steady-state DTRF process. This paper describes the development and application of the DTRF and SUP dynamic simulator, its benefits, architecture, and the operational experience with the simulator.

The experimental system for developing an effective tritium recovery technique was developed and tritium recovery experiments using Ar gas or Ar gas with 10-10000 ppm oxygen gas were performed using D-2 gas instead of tritium gas. It was found that deuterium permeation through two membranes decreased by installing the double pipe concept with Ar gas. By introducing. Ar gas with 10000 ppm oxygen gas, the concentration of deuterium permeation through two membranes decreased by more than 11200, compared with the one pipe concept, indicating that most of the deuterium was scavenged by Ar gas or reacted with oxygen to form a hydroxide. However, most of the hydroxide was trapped at the surface of the membranes because of the short duration of the experiment.

This program consists of two activities; development of tritium permeation barriers in the heat exchanger tubes and development of tritium removal method from the SC-CO2. For permeation reduction, a glassy coating was developed as the tritium permeation barrier for the SC-CO2 system. Experimental results showed the physical and chemical integrity of the coating for 100 hours soaking in the SC-CO2. Significant permeation reduction of 1/20 to 1/60 are obtained But, further permeation reduction is desired through a new coating technique development, since the permeation reduction at lower temperatures is small.

Accounting strategy of tritium inventory in the Heavy Water Detritiation Pilot Plant from ICIT Rm. Valcea	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				SYSTEM	In this paper we present a methodology for determination of tritium inventory in a tritium removal facility. The method proposed is based on the developing of computing models for accountancy of the mobile tritium inventory in the separation processes, of the stored tritium and of the trapped tritium inventory in the structure of the process system components. The configuration of the detritiation process is a combination of isotope catalytic exchange between water and hydrogen (LPCE) and the cryogenic distillation of hydrogen isotopes (CD). The computing model for tritium inventory in the LPCE process and the CD process will be developed basing on mass transfer coefficients in catalytic isotope exchange reactions and in dual-phase system (liquid-vapour) of hydrogen isotopes distillation process. Accounting of tritium inventory stored in metallic hydride will be based on in-bed calorimetry. Estimation of the trapped tritium inventoty can be made by subtraction of the mobile and stored tritium inventories from the global tritium inventory of the plant area. Determinations of the global tritium inventory of the plant area will be made on a regular basis by measuring any tritium quantity entering or leaving the plant area. This methodology is intended to be applied to the Heavy Water Detritiation Pilot Plant from ICIT Rm. Valcea (Romania) and to the Cernavoda Tritium Removal Facility (which will be built in the next 5-7 years).

Recently, a study on the tritium handling system for recovery of the tritium collected from the WTRF was started. Some tritium would enter the steel of the container walls and subsequently decay to helium. This helium can deteriorate the mechanical properties of the material of the tritium handling system. To evaluate the tritium and helium inventory in the stainless steel wall of this system, the time-dependent diffusion equation was developed, solved and the results are presented in this paper. These results were compared to previous work that evaluated the tritium inventory in the stainless steel wall of 50-L tritium containers. Tritium and helium concentration profiles and the corresponding inventories were evaluated with respect to the various parameters such as exposure time, temperature, and partial pressure. After 24 years, the helium inventory in the wall of the tritium handling system exceeds the tritium inventory.

The maintenance role is fundamental because it has to quantify all the technical, economic and human elements as an integrated system for it creates an important feedback for activities concerning the life cycle of the nuclear installation. In maintenance activities as in any dynamic area, new elements appear continuously which, sometimes require new approaches. The theory of fuzzy logic and the software Lab VIEW supplied to the Nuclear Detritiation Plant (NDP) is part of National Research and Development Institute for Cryogenics and Isotopic Technologies-ICIT, Rm. Valcea, used for predictive maintenance to assure safety operation. The final aim is to achieve the best practices for maintenance of the Plant that processes tritium.			vasile.anghel@gmail.com					ANGHEL V, WSEAS J; ANGHEL V, 2007, SIMULATION COMPLEX S, P189; CHAI J, 1998, INVESTIGATION FUZZY; Lowrance W., 1976, ACCEPTABLE RISK; National Instruments, LABVIEW US MAN; REIFMAN J, 1999, NUCL SCI ENG, V131, P1; SELF K, 1990, DESIGNING FUZZY LOGI, V42, P105; Zadeh L.

Overview of the National Ignition Facility	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					The National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory will be the world's largest and most powerful laser system for inertial confinement fusion (ICF) and experiments studying high energy density (HED) science. NIF is a 192 beam Nd-glass laser facility that will produce 1.8 MJ 500 TW of ultraviolet light making it over fifty times more energetic than present ICF facilities. The NIF Project began in 1995 and is scheduled for completion in 2009. Ignition experiments on NIF, which will use tritium, are scheduled to begin in 2010. Tritium will arrive at the facility in individual target assemblies. The assemblies will be mounted to the Cryogenic TARget POSitioner (TARPOS), which provides the cryogenic cooling systems necessary to complete the formation of the ignition target's fuel ice layer. It also provides the positioning system that transports and holds the target at the center of the NIF chamber during a shot. After a shot, unburned tritium will be captured by the cryopumps. Upon regeneration, the cryopump effluent will be directed to the Tritium Processing System, part of NIF's. Personnel and Environmental Protection Systems. These systems also include, local contamination control systems, area and stack tritium monitoring systems, a decontamination area, and waste packaging and characterization capability. This equipment will be used along with standard contamination control practices to manage the tritium hazard to workers and to limit releases to the environment to negligibly small amounts.

Tritium facilities for the LMJ cryogenic targets	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				FABRICATION	As part of the French Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) experiments, cryogenic target assemblies (CTAs) for the Laser Megajoule (LMJ) program are manufactured and filled at CEA Valduc (Dijon) in tritium facilities. They will be moved at about 20 K into a transport cryostat for cryogenic targets, and will be driven from CEA/Valduc to CEA/CESTA (Bordeaux). This paper deals with the description of the tritium facilities for the LMJ cryogenic target. Twelve gloveboxes are needed to furnish 6 CTAs at the same time. These twelve gloveboxes make a relative independent set in the Valduc tritium building and house equipment to prepare the CTAs and the different vacuum vessels, to store and purify gas, to fill and cool the targets and transport them at cryogenic temperature.

Inertial fusion energy power reactor fuel recovery system	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					A conceptual design is proposed to support the recovery of un-expended fuel, ash, and associated post-detonation products resident in plasma exhaust from a similar to 2 G WIFE direct drive power reactor. The design includes systems for the safe and efficient collection, processing, and purification of plasma exhaust fuel components. The system has been conceptually designed and sized such that tritium bred within blankets, lining the reactor target chamber, can also be collected, processed, and introduced into the fuel cycle. The system will nominally be sized to process similar to 2 kg of tritium per day and is designed to link directly to the target chamber vacuum pumping system. An effort to model the fuel recovery system (FRS) using the Aspen Plus engineering code has commenced. The system design supports processing effluent gases from the reactor directly from the exhaust of the vacuum pumping system or in batch mode, via a buffer vessel in the Receiving and Analysis System. Emphasis is on nuclear safety, reliability, and redundancy as to maximize availability. The primary goal of the fuel recovery system design is to economically recycle components of direct drive IFE fuel. The FRS design is presented as a facility sub-system in the context of supporting the larger goal of producing safe and economical IFE power.	[Gentile, C. A.; Kozub, T.; Langish, S. W.; Ciebiera, L.

Inertial fusion ignition target designs have a smooth spherical shell of cryogenic Deuterium-Tritium (DT) solid contained within a metal or plastic shell that is a few mm in diameter. Fusion is attained by imploding these shells under the symmetric application of energy beams. For IFE targets the DT solid must also survive the process of injecting it into the power plant reactor. Non-ignition IF targets often require a non-cryogenic DT gas fill of a glass or polymeric shell. In this paper an overview will be given of recent LANL activities to study cryogenic DT layering, observe tritium exposure effects on IF relevant materials, and fill targets in support of IF implosion experiments.

LLE's high-pressure DT-fill process control system	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					The OMEGA laser at the University of Rochester's Laboratory for Laser Energetics (UR/LLE) implodes fusion targets that contain cryogenic solid deuterium-tritium (DT) ice layers. These ICF targets are fabricated in a high-pressure DT-fill process. This paper describes the integration and control of this DT-fill process. The appropriate safety-control response during the DT-fill process depends on the location of the tritium inventory and where the containment alarm is detected A control response that is deemed appropriate earlier in the fill process could be a dangerous action at a later point in the fill process. The control system must adapt as the DT inventory moves through the process train. This is achieved by defining eight "fill states" in the fill process. The control system transitions to the appropriate fill state as the DT fill progresses. The fill state reflects the tritium location, pressure, and temperature. Steps are taken to ensure that the tritium location and the fill state are in agreement. The control system monitors the containment system's integrity and will take the appropriate action, based on the tritium location and the type of containment failure. This approach not only ensures process safety, but also maximizes the productivity by executing process pauses (in lieu of aborts) when conditions allow.	[Duffy, T.; Shmayda, W.

Laser megajoule safety issues	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					The LASER MEGAJOULE (LMJ) will be an experimental fusion laser facility located at CEA-CESTA research center, close to Bordeaux. Fusion experiments will involve targets filled with tritium, requiring the design of containment devices to ensure worker protection against radiation exposure according to the French safety regulations. This paper reports the work performed by the LMJ safety team to design these confinement devices. At first, the paper describes the tritium inventory evaluated inside the facility. Then, specifications and allocations for the vacuum and air purge systems of the target bay are defined and explained A spread model is described to evaluate the spatial repartition of the residual contamination in the chamber, concluding to an anisotropic process. Consequently, security factors have been defined according to the different locations inside the target bay. Definition of containment protections for the equipment of the target bay like fume hoods and glove boxes does not depend only on the effects of contamination (internal exposure hazards), but also on activation of materials (external exposure). Consequently, safety requirements have been defined in order to design containment devices. Finally, a specification of containment barriers performances is given (static and dynamic modes). Leakage of the barriers, negatives pressures, cleaning and conditioning are addressed.

Tests of isotopic separation efficiency of palladium packed columns	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					The isotopic effect of palladium has been applied in different ways to separate hydrogen isotopes for many years. At Savannah River Site palladium deposited on kieselguhr (Pd/k) is used in a thermal cycling absorption process (TCAP) to purify tritium for over ten years. The need to design columns for different throughputs and the desire to advance the performance of TCAP created the need to evaluate different column designs and packing materials for their separation efficiency. In this work, columns with variations in length, diameter and metal foam presence were tested using an isotope displacement method. A simple computer model was also developed to calculate the number of theoretical separation stages based on the test results. The effects of column diameter, metal foam presence and gas flow rate were identified.	[Heung, L. K.; Staack, G. C.; Klein, J. E.; Jacobs, W.

For a certain quantity, they are very competitive and present several benefits. Nevertheless no active packing material allows to have simultaneously good enrichment performances for tritium production and high decontamination capabilities for HD gases. The influence of the packing material is first described in this article. Then two specific processes (TCAP and Reverse Chromatography), each well adapted to perform one target, are presented. Finally, the problematic to propose an optimized treatment scheme associating these two processes is formulated.

Experimental verification of hydrogen isotope separation by pressure swing adsorption	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					Focusing on synthetic zeolites that adsorb hydrogen isotopes at liquid N-2 temperature with priority in the order of T-2, DT, D-2, HT, HD and H-2, we have been developing a pressure swing adsorption process system for hydrogen isotope separation. For this purpose, we carried out fundamental experiments of adsorption and desorption of a tracer D-2 in bulk H-2 with zeolite packed-bed columns. In this paper the results are reported that D-2 is enriched in the adsorbed phase at separation factors near 2.0, flowing through zeolite 5A and 13X packed-beds at 77.4 K. These are in agreement with values predicted from the multi-component equilibrium characteristics. In the gas samples recovered by evacuating the packed-beds, however D-2 was detected at a relative concentration of 1.20 or 1.32 to that in the feed gas. This lower range results from the isotopic mass effect in kinetic process. That suggests a highly D-2-enriched residual left during evacuation. This is verified with an unusually high enrichment factor of 6.68 or 9.21 for zeolite 5A or 13X measured in the residual sample desorbed from the packed-bed by heating up to room temperature.

Breakthrough curve analysis of pressure swing adsorption for hydrogen isotope separation	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					For the purpose of developing an effective system for hydrogen isotope separation, we have been studying the adsorption-desorption dynamic behavior of hydrogen and deuterium in a packed-bed column with synthetic zeolites, aimed at applying the pressure swing adsorption process. The adsorption behavior of molecules in the packed-bed is reflected in the breakthrough curves. To understand the characteristic behaviors of hydrogen isotopes in the packed-bed, we carried out breakthrough experiments in a conventional adsorption process and in a practical process following sequential processes alternating between adsorption and desorption. From the former experiments, the results were obtained that the overall mass transfer was influenced by longitudinal dispersion relating to the superficial velocity and that the process governing the mass transfer within adsorbents was diffusion in the macro-pores of pellets. In the latter experiments, unique profile breakthrough curves were observed. These curves can be described with the numerical simulation assuming the initial distributions in apacked-bed.

Hydrogen isotope separation using molecular sieve of synthetic zeolite 3A	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					It is known that hydrogen isotope molecules can be adsorbed easily onto synthetic zeolite 4A, 5A, and 13X at the liquid-nitrogen temperature of 77.4 K. We show here that hydrogen and deuterium are not adsorptive onto zeolite 3A at the same temperature. This phenomenon is explained by assuming the molecular sieve function in zeolite-3A-crystalline lattice structure. From a series of pseudo-isobaric experiments, it is also shown that the sieving phenomenon appears in a range above 77.4 K. This behavior is interpreted as resulting on the dependence of sieve mesh size on temperature, where the sieving effect is considered to appear at a certain temperature. In this interpretation, an isotopic difference between hydrogen and deuterium is suggested to exist in the sieving effect appearance temperatures. This is endorsed in the result of pseudo-isobaric experiments. This temperature deference is very significant because that indicates the possibility of an effective method of hydrogen isotope separation. This possibility is verified through an experimental series of adsorption-desorption with a mixture of H-2 and D-2, where the gas samples adsorbed through the sieve operated at intentionally selected temperatures are isolated and then analyzed. The result demonstrates remarkable values of isotope separation factor.

By an optimal design of the cycle scheme, this problem could be avoided. A "worst case scenario" is usually occurring when the extracted fraction consists of one prevalent isotope such as hydrogen and small amounts of the other two hydrogen isotopes (deuterium and/or tritium). This situation is further complicated by two parameters of the distillation column: the extraction flow rate and the hold-up. The present work proposes the conceptual design of an extraction system associated to the cryogenic distillation column used in hydrogen separation processes. During this process, the heavy fraction (DT, T-2) is separated, its concentration being the highest at the bottom of the distillation column. From this place the extraction of the gaseous phase can now begin. Being filled with adsorbent, the extraction system is used to temporarily store the heavy fraction. Also the extraction system provides samples for the gas chromatograph. The research work is focused on the existent pilot plant for tritium and deuterium separation from our institute to validate the experiments carried out until now.

Designing and implementing the concept of cryogenic distillation columns require experiments to be conducted as well as computer simulations. Particularly, computer simulations are of great importance when designing and evaluating the performances of a column or a series of columns. Experimental data collected from laboratory work will be used as input for computer simulations run at larger scale (for The Pilot Plant for Tritium and Deuterium Separation) in order to increase the confidence in the simulated results. Studies carried out were focused on the following: - Quantitative analyses of important parameters such as the number of theoretical plates, inlet area, reflux flow, flow-rates extraction, working pressure, etc. - Columns connected in series in such a way to fulfil the separation requirements. Experiments were carried out on a laboratory-scale installation to investigate the performance of contact elements with continuous packing. The packing was manufactured in our institute.			anisia@icsi.ro	STEFANESCU, IOAN/D-9828-2011	STEFANESCU, IOAN/0000-0002-6391-7591			ALEEKSEEV I, 2006, EXPT RESULTS HYDROGE; BORNEA A, 2006, P CRYOPRAGUE; KINOSHITA M, 1981, J NUCL SCI TECHNOLOG, V18	3	7	7	1	7	AMER NUCLEAR SOC	LA GRANGE PK	555 N KENSINGTON AVE, LA GRANGE PK, IL 60526 USA	1536-1055			FUSION SCI TECHNOL	Fusion Sci.

This reactor is moderated and cooled by heavy water that becomes continuously contaminated with tritium. Because of this reason, the National R&D Institute for Cryogenic and Isotopic Technologies developed a detritiation technology based on catalytic isotopic exchange and cryogenic distillation. The main effort of our Institute was focused on finding more efficient catalysts with a longer operational life. Some of the tritium removal processes involved in Fusion Science & Technology use this type of catalyst(1). Several Pt/C/PTFE hydrophobic catalysts that could be used in isotopic exchange process 2,3,4 were produced. The present paper presents a comparative study between the physical and morphological properties of different catalysts manufactured by impregnation at our institute. The comparison consists of a survey of specific surface, pores volume and pores distribution.			felicia@icsi.ro	STEFANESCU, IOAN/D-9828-2011	STEFANESCU, IOAN/0000-0002-6391-7591			ANDERSON JR, 1975, STRUCTURE METALLIC C, P89; ASAKURA J, 1982, J NUCL SCI TECHNOL, V19; BRUGGEMAN A, 2002, SCK CEN FUSION PROGR; CRISTESCU I, 2002, FUS SCI TECHNOL, V3; IDITOIU C, 1984, REV CHIMIE BUCURESTI, V35; IONITA G, 2005, FUS SCI TECHNOL, V4; MURGULESCU IG, 1981, INTRO CHIMIA FIZICA, P545; PECULEA M, 1984, APA GREA PROCESE IND, P45; SPAGNOLO DA, 1995, FUS TECHOL, V28	9	6	7	1	8	AMER NUCLEAR SOC	LA GRANGE PK	555 N KENSINGTON AVE, LA GRANGE PK, IL 60526 USA	1536-1055			FUSION SCI TECHNOL	Fusion Sci.

Experiments on Water Detritiation and Cryogenic Distillation at TLK; Impact on ITER fuel cycle subsystems interfaces	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					The ITER Isotope Separation System (ISS) and Water Detritiation System (WDS) should be integrated in order to reduce potential chronic tritium emissions from the ISS. This is achieved by routing the top (protium) product from the ISS to a feed point near the bottom end of the WDS Liquid Phase Catalytic Exchange (LPCE) column. This provides an additional barrier against ISS emissions and should mitigate the memory effects due to process parameter fluctuations in the ISS. To support the research activities needed to characterize the performances of various components for WDS and ISS processes under various working conditions and configurations as needed for ITER design, an experimental facility called TRENTA representative of the ITER WDS and ISS protium separation column, has been commissioned and is in operation at TLK. The experimental program on TRENTA facility is conducted to provide the necessary design data related to the relevant ITER operating modes. The operation availability and performances of ISS-WDS have impact on ITER fuel cycle subsystems with consequences on the design integration. The preliminary experimental data on TRENTA facility are presented.	[Cristescu, I.; Cristescu, I.

In the case where the column was filled with natural water, the time required to achieve steady state was almost the same as that for the column operated under the total reflux mode. The manipulated variables were flow rate of the bottom stream for the control of the bottom tritium concentration, and flow rate of the hydrogen stream for the control of the top tritium concentration. For both the variables, the response curve was expressed by the first-order lag system, and a PID controller could be applied.

Behavior of solid polymer membrane electrolyzers in use with highly tritiated water	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					These days more and more modern electrolysis cells are operated with new solid polymer membranes. These membranes prevailing DuPont's Nafion (R) are not only used for electrolysis but as well for the wide spectrum of fuel cells due to their good mechanical and chemical stability and the high proton conductivity. For that reason it is intended to use these solid polymer membranes for the electrolyzer units in the ITER Water Detritiation System (WDS). The influence of Tritium during water electrolysis to the membrane material is still not sufficiently investigated. Therefore long-term experiments ofsolidpolymer membranes were performed at Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK). The chemical degradation and durability behavior of the used Nafion (R) 117 membrane are investigated in details under tritiated water conditions. For comparison a second cell was operated with demineralized water for the same period. In addition to the experimental rigs with single Nafion (R) membranes, two industrial electrolyzer units equipped with Nafion (R) membranes were operated during different tritium experiments at TLK. Before operation they had been modified to be compatible for tritium operation. After long operation period no degradation in the performance of the electrolyzers is observable.

Hydrogen isotope recovery using a cathode water vapor feed PEM electrolyzer	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				DURABILITY; SYSTEM	A critical component of tritium glovebox operations is the recovery of high value tritium from the water vapor in the glove box atmosphere. One proposed method to improve existing tritium recovery systems is to replace the disposable hot magnesium beds used to separate the hydrogen and oxygen in water with continuous use Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolyzers (PEMEs). This study examines radiation exposure to the membrane of a PEW and examines the sizing difference that would be needed if the electrolyzer were operated with a cathode water vapor feed instead of an anode liquid water feed.

Research of the tritium saturation, isotope diffusion and decontamination of stainless steel using magnetic microscopy	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY				CONTAMINATION	The investigations of the tritium distribution in a surface layer and in the depth of samples using a magnetic microscope were carried out. The dependence of a saturation level in the boundary layer for hydrogen was established from a preliminary examination Of samples. Conservation of the tritium distribution profile in the depth of the stainless steel samples after completion of their saturation and cooling was assigned. For Inconel-625 substantial tritium redistribution and release during storage (300K, 15 and 28 months) were experimentally ascertained to a greater degree satisfies the classical characteristics of the diffusion process. The "braking" effect of tritium diffusion was found by preliminary saturation of samples by hydrogen. Research in tritium decontamination effects for samples saturated with tritium with various technological preparation was carried out and essential increase of its efficiency was founded. The experiments emulated a model of technological operation cycle of the thermonuclear reactor.	[Markin, A. I.; Azizov, E. A.; Siromyatnikov, N. I.; Cherkovets, V.

Effect of radiogenic helium on stainless steel 12Cr18Ni10Ti structural changes and hydrogen sorption	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 16-21, 2007	Rochester, NY					The tritium trick technique was used to build-up radiogenic helium inside stainless steel 12Cr18Ni10Ti (SS). A great quantity of defects with a mean diameter of 20 nm, most probably platelet-like bubbles with He-3 atoms, was observed in He-3-containing samples. The mean density of these bubbles in SS samples containing similar to 75 appm of He-3 is estimated to be 6.10(20) m(-3). Much larger helium bubbles were observed in SS after annealing the samples at T >= 1170 K Thermal release of radiogenic helium occurs at T>1500 K. The presence of 3He in structural materials causes the formation of an additional state for hydrogen sorption.
