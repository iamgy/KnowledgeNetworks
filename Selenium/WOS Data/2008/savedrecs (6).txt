J	Yeh, HM				Yeh, Ho-Ming			Design of batch-type flat-plate thermal diffusion columns for recovery of deuterium from water-isotopes mixture with energy consumption rate fixed	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						Deuterium recovery; Thermal diffusion; Water-isotope mixture; Design parameter	HEAVY-WATER; SEPARATION; ENRICHMENT; GAS	The effect of design parameters on the recovery of deuterium from the separation of water-isotope mixture in batch-type flat-plate thermal diffusion columns with the consideration of the energy consumption rate kept unchanged, have been investigated. It was found that considerable improvement in performance can be achieved by increasing the aspect ratio, as well as increasing the inclined angle and/or decreasing the plate spacing, resulting in reduced the remixing effect.

ARIES CS Team	Systems studies and optimization of the ARIES-CS power plant	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						compact stellarator; fusion power plant; parameter optimization	ENERGY CONFINEMENT; PHYSICS ISSUES; DENSITY LIMIT; STELLARATOR; REACTOR; TOKAMAK; DESIGN; BETA	A stellarator systems/optimization code is used to optimize the ARIES-CS fusion power plant parameters for minimum cost of electricity subject to a large number of physics, engineering, and in-vessel component constraints for a compact stellarator configuration. Different physics models, reactor component models, and costing algorithms are used to test sensitivities to models and assumptions. The most important factors determining the size of the fusion power core are the allowable neutron and radiative power fluxes to the wall, the distance needed between the edge of the plasma and the nonplanar magnetic field coils for the intervening components, and an adequate tritium breeding ratio. The magnetic field and coil parameters are determined from both plasma performance and constraints on the Nb3Sn superconductor. The same costing approach and algorithms used in previous ARIES studies are used with updated material costs. The result is a compact stellarator reactor with a major radius close to that of tokamaks. A one-dimensional power balance code is used to study the path to ignition and the effect of different plasma and confinement assumptions on plasma performance for the reference plasma and coil configuration. A number of variations are studied that affect the size and cost of the fusion power core: maximum field at the coils, component cost penalties, a different blanket and shield approach, alternative plasma and coil configurations, etc. Comparisons are made with some earlier ARIES power plant studies. A number of issues for the development of compact quasi-axisymmetric stellarators are identified.	[Lyon, J. F.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Ku, L. P.; Zarnstorff, M.

ARIES-CS Team	Divertor configuration and heat load studies for the ARIES-CS fusion power plant	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						divertor; heat load; fusion power plant	ISLAND DIVERTOR; STELLARATOR; W7-AS; EDGE; NCSX	The critical issue of divertor configuration for heat and particle flux control in a conceptual ARIES compact stellarator (CS) reactor is addressed. The goal is to determine a divertor location and geometry with a peak heat load of not more than 10 MW/m(2) for a CS equilibrium based on the configuration to be used in the NCSX experiment, optimized for high beta (6.4%) and designed for low alpha-particle power loss fraction (<= 5%). The surface heat flux on the target has three components: thermal particles, lost energetic alphas, and radiation from the core and the scrape-off layer. The first two components are dominant and their magnitudes can be comparable. To maintain a tritium-breeding ratio of 1.1, the total target area should not exceed 15% of the boundary plasma surface area. The divertor concept consists of two pairs of target plates per field period, one pair each at the top and bottom of the plasma. The heat flux profile is assessed by assuming that the parallel transport can be represented by field line mapping and that cross-field transport can be modeled with a prescribed field line diffusion scheme. In this manner, the poloidal and toroidal extents of the plates and their shape and distance to the plasma are designed to intercept all the heat flux and to minimize the peak thermal heat load. An approximate scheme, based on particle drift orbits in the core and field line tracing in the edge, is derived to estimate the alpha-particle heat load distribution over the plates and the first wall. The best plate configuration to date yields total peak heat loads (thermal + alpha) ranging from 5 to 18 MW/m(2). Further optimization of the target plates is required to reach the design goal, which will be addressed in a future study.	[Mau, T. K.; Grossman, A. A.; Raffray, A. R.; Wang, X.

This power plant design contains many innovative features to improve the physics, engineering, and safety performance of the stellarator concept. ARIES-CS utilizes a dual-cooled lead lithium blanket that employs low-activation ferritic steel as a structural material, with the first wall cooled by helium and the breeding zone self-cooled by flowing lead lithium. In this paper we examine the safety and environmental performance of ARIES-CS by reporting radiological inventories, decay heat, and radioactive waste management options and by examining the response of ARIES-CS to accident conditions. These accidents include conventional loss of coolant and loss of flow events, an ex-vessel loss of coolant event, and an in-vessel loss of coolant with bypass event that mobilizes in-vessel radioactive inventories (e.g., tritium and erosion dust from plasma facing components). Our analyses demonstrate that the decay heat can be safely removed from ARIES-CS and the facility can meet the no-evacuation requirement.	[Merrill, B. J.; Moore, R. L.; Petti, D.

Kusum			An improved liquid scintillation counting method for the determination of gross alpha activity in groundwater wells	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						groundwater; liquid scintillation; radiation, alpha; radioactivity, environmental		A liquid scintillation counting (LSC) method having several advantages over the gas proportional counting (GPC) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Method 900.0 for the detection of gross alpha activity in drinking water was evaluated in this study. The improved method described here involves the use of nitromethane as the quench agent for establishing counting efficiencies and spillover factors, and it minimizes sample preparation. It has the advantage of achieving the regulatory detection limit of 111 mBq L-1 with short count times (100 min) and small sample aliquot sizes. A thorough method validation study was performed by testing field samples ranging in total dissolved solids (TDS) from 0.3 mg L-1 to 1,000 mg L-1 and spiking each matrix from 194 mBq L-1 to 11.6 Bq L-1. Comparable method precision and accuracy was observed on the two types of LSC instruments tested, Perkin Elmer Quantulus 1220 and Packard 2550, with the former giving better performance. Data presented demonstrate that this efficient and high throughput LSC method is suitable for groundwater samples in excess of 1,000 mg L-1 of TDS in contrast with the 500 mg L-1 limit by the routine GPC method. Groundwater wells across the state of California were sampled, analyzed for gross alpha activity using the EPA-approved method and the improved LSC method, and the results were compared.

Radiological impact of almost a century of phosphate industry in Flanders, Belgium	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						environmental assessment; environmental impact; radiation risk; radon		In Belgium, since about 1920, the phosphate industry has been an important industrial activity. It is principally situated in Flanders, the northern part of Belgium, and produces mainly phosphoric acid, fertilizers, and cattle food. At its height, between 1980 and 1990, it processed between 1.5 and 2.0 Mt of phosphate ore of varying origin per year. In total, more than 60 Mt of ore were handled, containing about 72 TBq of Ra-226 and 3.5 TBq of Th-232. Three different processing techniques in six large production sites gave rise to 50 Mt of phosphogypsum and 2.7 Mt of calcium fluoride sludge, all mainly stored on large deposits. In addition, limited recycling of phosphogypsum as building material has occurred in the past. Also, 10 Mt of phosphogypsum was discharged into a large tidal river. One plant still produces 0.25 Mt of gypsum per year. Liquid effluents, containing 13 TBq of radium chloride, were discharged into two small rivers, thus contaminating over 200 ha of land. Approximately 8 TBq of Ra-226 and 0.6 TBq thorium ended up in finished products such as fertilizers. Despite these large production figures, so far the radiological impact for the Flemish population has been limited, but this might worsen in the future. The major risk consists in establishing residential areas on land that is contaminated with Ra-226 because of liquid effluents or on forgotten gypsum deposits. Doing so might lead to enhanced indoor radon concentrations. In three isolated cases, we found houses built on gypsum deposits where the increased indoor radon levels raised the annual radiation dose to the inhabitants by about 4 mSv.

Count Rate Performance of the MicroPET Focus 220 Animal Scanner in Singles Transmission Scanning Mode	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Attenuation correction; microPET; positron emission tomography; small animal imaging	ATTENUATION CORRECTION; PET	Count rate loss in singles transmission scans due to dead time can decrease the accuracy of attenuation correction. In addition, for very low transmission source activities measured attenuation may be affected by noise and background radiation emitted by radioactive lutetium-176 in the scintillator material. The aims of this study were to investigate count rate performance in singles transmission scanning for the microPET Focus 220 animal scanner, to examine the effect of energy window width on noise, scatter and dead time, and to determine the optimal range of activity for accurate attenuation correction. 'Transmission measurements were performed with a decaying (99m)Tc point source and using wide (21%) and narrow (4%) energy windows. We observed count rate losses at the detector level and in the front end electronics during energy discrimination. Further losses emerged due to multiplexing at the detector head interface for activities higher than 150 MBq for the wide energy window. Substantial count rate losses during transfer of list mode data from the microPET to the PC were also observed for this condition. Lutetium-176 background caused a significant deviation of measured attenuation for activities lower than 10 MBq for both energy windows. No significant bias due to scatter was introduced when using the wide energy window. We conclude that accurate attenuation data can be obtained with single photon transmission source activity in the range 1.0 to 150 MBq without requiring deadtime correction.

High Detection Performance of Particle Detectors Based on SI InP Doped With Ti and Zn	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Gamma ray; InP; particle detector; radiation detector; semi-insulating	SEMIINSULATING INP; SEMICONDUCTOR-DETECTORS; RADIATION DETECTORS; NUCLEAR RADIATION; ROOM-TEMPERATURE	In this work, we present results of measurements of spectra of alpha-particles carried out on semi-insulating (SI) InP detectors. The detectors were fabricated from Ti and Zn co-doped SI InP crystals grown by Czochralski technique. Tests of detectors performance with alpha-particles emitted from (241) Am (5.48 MeV) radioactive source are reported. Excellent detectors performance has been evaluated by values of charge collection efficiency 99% and energy resolution similar to 1% obtained from the spectra measured at 230 K. Such high performance can be explained by InP doping with suitable Ti atoms and co-doping with low concentration of Zn acceptors sufficient for the fill compensation of shallow donors, to reach SI properties. The electron mobility of reported SI InP detectors co-doped with Ti and Zn has been found to be equal to 2510 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) tit room temperature. This value is much higher than that obtained previously with our SI InP co-doped with Ti and Mn or with InP crystals converted to SI state by temperature annealing. Excellent detector performance and high electron mobility makes the reported InP material promising to be used for the detection of X-rays and gamma-radiation.

J	Tada, K; Yamamoto, A; Yamane, Y; Kitamura, Y				Tada, Kenichi; Yamamoto, Akio; Yamane, Yoshihiro; Kitamura, Yasunori			Applicability of the Diffusion and Simplified P3 Theories for Pin-by-Pin Geometry of BWR	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						pin-by-pin calculation method; BWR; SP3 theory; diffusion theory; MOC; pin power; multi-group	APPROXIMATION; DERIVATION; EQUATIONS	The pin-by-pin fine-mesh core calculation method is considered as a candidate next-generation core calculation method for BWR. In this study, the diffusion and simplified P3 (SP3) theories are applied to the BWR pin-by-pin fine-mesh calculation. The performances of the diffusion and SP3 theories for cell-homogeneous pin-by-pin fine-mesh calculation for BWR are evaluated through comparison with a cell-heterogeneous detailed transport calculation by the method of characteristics (MOC). Two-dimensional, 2 x 2 multi-assemblies geometry is used to compare the prediction accuracies of the diffusion and SP3 theories. The 2 x 2 multi-assemblies geometry consists of 9 x 9 UO(2) fuel assemblies that have two different enrichment splittings. To minimize the cell-homogenization error, the SPH method is applied for the pin-by-pin fine-mesh calculation. The SPH method is a technique that reproduces a result of heterogeneous calculation using that of homogeneous calculation. The calculation results indicated that the diffusion theory shows a discrepancy larger than that of the SP3 theory on the pin-wise fission rate distribution. In contrast to the diffusion theory, the SP3 theory shows a much better accuracy on the pin-wise fission rate distribution. The computation time using the SP3 theory is about 1.5 times longer than that using the diffusion theory. The BWR core analysis consists of various calculations, e.g., the cross section interpolation, neutron flux calculation, thermal hydraulic calculation, and burn-up calculation. The function of the calculation time for the neutron flux calculation is usually less than half in the typical BWR core analysis. Therefore, the difference in the calculation Lime between the diffusion and SP3 theories would have no significant impact oil the calculation time of the BWR core analysis. For these reasons, the SP3 theory is more suitable than the diffusion theory and is expected to have sufficient accuracy for the 2 x 2 multi-assemblies geometry used in this study, which simulates a typical situation of the actual BWR core.

This study is aimed at examining the feasibility of reprocessed uranium (RepU) with or without the addition of minor actinide (MA) in LWR fuel cycle for PPP and to make a tentative economic assessment of RepU possessing the PPP feature. It was analytically clarified that RepU enriched to 5% (235)U by centrifugation produced denatured Pu at higher burnup than about 40 GWd/t. By the addition of more than 0.5% MA to RepU and natural uranium both enriched to 5%, Pu generated in the uranium fuel with MA added could be denatured up to 40 GWd/t at least. A diagram designed with functions of SFN rate and DH explicated the PPP features of re-enriched RepU and enriched natural uranium with or without MA addition. The economic assessment indicated that the cost of fuel cycle applying re-enriched RepU would be comparable to that of the conventional fuel cycle, if the cost of the source RepU is low. In addition, the LWR fuel cycle applying RepU for PPP was discussed.

In order to understand the mechanism of the nuclear thermal-hydraulic behavior in solution fuel criticality accidents, the mechanism of the oscillatory pressure response was Studied using both the measured data and visual observation of the solution behavior. A simplified vibration model for the estimation of the generated volume of radiolytic gas voids was proposed using the measured data of the pressure period and the solution mass. Rapid depressurization experiments with carbonic acid water were also carried out in order to verify the application of the simplified vibration model for radiolytic gas voids. Consequently, the generated volume of radiolytic gas voids for the oscillatory pressure case was correlated as a function of the energy for the generation of gas voids.

Removal of Mo from the simulated HLW glass containing oxides of Nd, Fe, Zr, Mo, Sri, Ni, Sr, Cd, Ru, and Se was also performed, and the fractions of these elements transferred into Cu were examined. Mixtures of Cu and a tertiary SiO(2)-B(2)O(3)-Na(2)O glass containing metallic Mo or MoO(3) were heated in an alumina crucible at 1,673 K in an Ar environment. The amounts Of Mo and MoO(3) added to 10g of the ternary glass were fixed at 0.1 and 0.15 respectively. As for the glass containing metallic Mo, more than 90% of Mo was extracted into liquid Cu. Spherical Cu metal buttons containing Mo formed on the bottom of the crucible when Cu was added at more than 10 times that of Mo on a mass basis. Removal of Mo from the glass containing MoO(3) wag also achieved by the addition of Si as a reducing agent for the reduction from MoO(3) to Mo. The fraction of Mo extracted into liquid Cu depended oil the molar ratio of Si to Cu added to the glass. The fraction increased LIP to 84% with an increase in the molar ratio of Si/Cu. However, the excess addition of Si may enhance the chemical interaction between the metal phase and the glass phase, and some of the metal phase containing Mo remained in the glass phase without forming a metal button. The optimum molar ratio of Si/Cu that produces the highest removal fraction was found to be approximately 0.5, Almost the same removal fraction of 88% was obtained from the simulated HLW glass under the condition of Si/Cu = 0.5. Nearly 100% of Ru was extracted into Cu with Mo, while Sr, Zr, and Nd were hardly extracted and remained in the glass.

A mixture response surface approach was employed to design the experiment and interpret the results. Compared with the blend composed of ordinary Portland cement (OPC), an optimum combination, resin: .17 (dry wt/wt); ASC: .43; zeolite: .10, and water: .30, was determined within a series of restrictions for Such properties as the slump, the 28-d compressive strength, the water immersion, the thaw-freeze resistance, the irradiation resistance. and the leaching rate. The diffusivities of (137)Cs and (60)Co of the waste forms resulting from the formula were 2.72E-06 (cm(2)/d) and 1.63E-07 (cm(2)/d) after 123 d, respectively. The loading amount of spent resins in the ASC form was larger than that in the OPC form by 5% under the equal performance indexes. The microanalysis indicated that there were many interlaced columnlike crystals (ettringites) developed in ASC-resin concrete. This structure could enhance the strength and stabilization of the waste forms significantly.

The corrosion tests were conducted for about 36,000 h, and changes in the corrosion amount and rate in the test duration were discussed. The relationships between the amount of corrosion and tube Surface temperature and heat flux were investigated, and the corrosion propagation mechanism considering intergranular penetration was studied based oil the observations of morphologies of corrosion surfaces and the measurements of intergranular penetration depths. After a long duration, the increases in the corrosion amount and rate Saturated when intergranular penetration and grain dropping occurred by turns. This result means that a linear estimation can be applied to the life prediction for corrosion. Three portions of the tube were observed, and the amounts of corrosion were different among the three portions, but no difference in the morphology of intergranular corrosion existed. The amount of corrosion was affected by both tube surface temperature and heat flux. A large amount of corrosion could be observed in both the boiling starting portion and the top, where high tube Surface temperature and heat flux were observed.

The preconcentration of trace elements Cd and Pb from uranium compounds was achieved by adsorbing Cd and Pb on CL-7301 resin in hydroiodic acid media, while the uranyl ion passed through. The method coupled with flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) was applied to analysis trace Cd and Pb in real samples. The preconcentration factors obtained by this method were 320 and 180 each for Cd and Pb, respectively. Under the optimized conditions, the detection limits corresponding to three times the standard deviation of the blank were found to be 0.13 ng center dot mL(-1) and 0.37 ng center dot mL(-1) for Cd and Pb, respectively. The relative standard deviation (RSD) and the recoveries of standard addition (spiked with 1-5 ng of Cd and Pb) were of < 5% (n = 10) and 96.2%-102.3%, respectively. Precision was also evaluated and found to be <= 4.3% (N = 11). The proposed method was successfully used for the determination of trace Cd and Pb in commercially available uranium compounds (e.g., uranyl acetate and triuranium octoxide).

Elemental analysis of phosphate rocks: For sustainable agriculture in Pakistan	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							TOXIC ELEMENTS; INAA; PHOSPHOGYPSUM; FERTILIZERS; THORIUM; URANIUM; SAMPLES; ORES	The concentration of 32 elements was determined in phosphate rock samples from the Hazara phosphate deposits of Pakistan using instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) technique employing different irradiation protocols. These included 23 major, minor and trace elements (Al, As, Ba, Br, Co, Cr, Cs, Fe, Ga, Hf, K, Mn, Na, Rb, Sb, Sc, Sn, Ta, Th, U, V, Zn and Zr) and 9 rare earth elements (REEs) namely Ce, Eu, Ho, La, Lu, Nd, Sm, Tb and Yb. The results have been compared with the global values of these elements. The concentrations for most of the elements studied are lower than the concentrations reported in the literature whereas the concentrations of As, Co, Fe, K, Mn, Na and Sb are comparable. Two samples namely HR-4 and HR-5 have the highest concentrations for majority of the REFs with high enrichment factors. The quality assurance of data was performed through the concurrent use of Lake Sediment (SL-1) and GSJ-JR-1 (Rhyolite) reference materials. The acquired data will serve as a reference for the follow-up studies to assess the agronomic effectiveness of the Hazara phosphate rocks.	[Javied, Sabiha; Chaudhry, M.

Quality control of no-carrier-added (YCl3)-Y-90 by estimating the labeling efficiency using its reaction with DOTATOC	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							TERNARY COMPLEX-FORMATION; NEUROENDOCRINE TUMORS; SOMATOSTATIN ANALOGS; RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY; SERUM-PROTEINS; Y-90; IN-111; RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY; PHOSPHATE; DIAGNOSIS	The (YCl3)-Y-90 radionuclide precursor (solution of Y-90(3+) in diluted HCl) of high purity and high specific activity is already commercially produced and successfully used in nuclear medicine. At the Nuclear Physics Institute ASCR, the (YCl3)-Y-90 radionuclide precursor is prepared using extraction (SrY)-Sr-90-Y-90 generator (technology of centrifuge extractors with di-2-ethylhexylphosphoric acid, D2EHPA).(1) Its radionuclidic, radiochemical, and chemical purity were examined and specified. The procedure developed for labeling of DOTA-Tyr(3)-octreotide (DOTATOC) with carrier-free Y-86/90 by ROSCH2 at the Institute of Nuclear Chemistry of the University Mainz was optimized and modified in our Department of Radiopharmaceuticals at NPI ASCR as standard labeling test (SLT) for analytical purposes. The SLT as a method for (YCl3)-Y-90 radionuclide precursor quality control determining its labeling efficiency using ITLC SG chromatography is described and proposed thereinafter. The labeling-efficiency of the tested batches of our product reached more than 95%.	[Henke, K.

Accurate determination of individual lanthanides in biological materials by NAA with pre- and post-irradiation separation	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							NEUTRON-ACTIVATION ANALYSIS; RARE-EARTH-ELEMENTS; ANION EXCHANGE BEHAVIOUR; RESINS	A new method has been developed aimed at determining traces of lanthanides in the materials of biological origin by NAA. The chemical procedure that involves both, selective and quantitative pre-irradiation isolation of the elements of interest and post-irradiation separation of lanthanides into two groups has been employed. The method is based on classical column ion-exchange and extraction chromatography. In the pre-irradiation step all the accompanying elements are eliminated and the quantitatively isolated lanthanides fraction is free from highly activating macro components, as well as from other trace elements, including uranium, which is the source of spectral and nuclear interferences. After neutron irradiation, the lanthanide fraction is divided into two sub-fractions, taking advantage of the different anion-exchange affinities of individual lanthanide complexes with EDTA towards strongly basic anion-exchanger. This provides the favorable gamma-ray spectrometric measurement conditions enabling reliable determination of 13 elements.	[Danko, B.; Dybczynski, R.

Chemical effects on K and L shell production cross sections and transfer probabilities in Nb compounds	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							VACANCY TRANSFER PROBABILITIES; RAY-INTENSITY RATIOS; 3D ELEMENTS; FLUORESCENCE YIELDS; HF COMPOUNDS; L-I; ALPHA; BETA; PB; MO	In this study, the chemical effects on sigma(Ki) (i = alpha, beta), sigma(L alpha) cross sections, K-beta/K-alpha X-ray intensity ratios and vacancy transfer probabilities from K to L (eta (KL)) for pure Nb and Nb compounds were investigated. The samples were excited by 59.5 keV gamma-rays from Am-241 and 5.96 keV photon energy from a Fe-55 annular radioactive sources. K and L X-rays emitted by samples were counted by an Ultra-LEGe detector with a resolution of 150 eV at 5.9 keV. While it was observed that the chemical bonding had an effect on the sigma(K beta), sigma(L alpha) cross sections and K-beta/K-alpha X-ray intensity ratios for compounds, it was almost negligible for sigma(K alpha) cross section because K-alpha transitions (2P(3/2,1/2)-> 1S(1/2)) occurred in inner shells. It is well known that interactions between central element atom and ligands come into existence in valence state, so outer energy levels are sensitive to the chemical environment. The experimental values of sigma(K alpha) cross section and eta (KL) are in good agreement with theoretically calculated and other experimental values of pure niobium, but the experimental values of the sigma(K beta), sigma(L alpha) cross sections and K-beta/K-alpha X-ray intensity ratios have differences for some compounds because valence electrons have different bond distances and binding energies in different compounds.

DLLME technique was successfully used as a sample preparation method. In this preconcentration method, an appropriate mixture of extraction solvent, disperser solvent was injected rapidly into an aqueous solution containing Sm, Eu, Gd and Dy after complex formation using chelating reagent of the 1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphthol (PAN). After phase separation, 0.5 mL of the settled phase containing enriched analytes was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The main factors affected the preconcentration of Sm, Eu, Gd and Dy were extraction and dispersive solvent type and their volume, extraction time, volume of chelating agent (PAN), centrifuge speed and drying temperature of the samples.

Preparation, characterization and application of thorium oxalate for sorption of plutonium and americium from aqueous solution	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							NITRIC-ACID; ADSORPTION; ALUMINA	Synthetic inorganic exchangers exhibit good thermal and radiation stability. Thorium oxalate precipitate shows potential for co-precipitation of plutonium and americium from oxalate supernatant generated during plutonium oxalate precipitation. In the present study, efforts were made to prepare thorium oxalate precipitate to be used for column operation. Distribution ratios were determined to optimize conditions for sorption of plutonium and americium on thorium oxalate from nitric acid + oxalic acid solutions with composition similar to that of oxalate supernatant. Column experiments were also performed to evaluate the sorption capacity of thorium oxalate for plutonium and americium from the same medium. The result showed that, thorium oxalate prepared in 1.75M HNO3 at 70 C is suitable for column operations. These studies showed that plutonium and americium could be simultaneously removed from aqueous solutions with composition similar to plutonium oxalate waste using glass column packed with thorium oxalate and these nuclides could be recovered by eluting with 3M HNO3.

Estimation of isotopic composition of plutonium from thermal reactors by neutron coincidence counting through isotopic correlation technique	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							BURNUP; TRANSURANUS	Correlations have been established between %Eff Pu-240 and various plutonium isotopes formed in thermal reactors. Based on these correlations, a method has been developed for the estimation of isotopic composition of plutonium obtained from thermal reactors. The method is simple, fast, non-destructive and finds application for the verification of plutonium isotopic composition in the finished products of known plutonium content. The method could be applied in the nuclear fuel fabrication to verify and confirm the fissile content (Pu-239+Pu-241) specification. It has also been shown that in principle, similar correlations could be established for Pu obtained from different thermal reactor fuels with reactor specific fitting parameters.

Conditional acid uptake constant (K-H) of TEHDGA/n-dodecane and the ratio of TEHDGA to nitric acid were obtained as 1.72 and 1 : 0.96, respectively. The extracted species of uranium and thorium in the organic phase were found to be UO2(NO3)(2).2TEHDGA and Th(NO3)(4).2TEHDGA. A workable separation factor (D-Th/D-U) of the order of 300 was observed between thorium and uranium in the nitric acid range of 0.5M to 1.5M. Similar separation factor was also achieved at higher acidity when thorium was present in large concentration compared to uranium. These results indicate that TEHDGA solvent system could be a potential candidate for separation of thorium from uranium.	[Sharma, J. N.; Ruhela, R.; Harindaran, K. N.; Mishra, S. L.; Tangri, S.

Investigation of the sample characteristics needed for the determination of the origin of uranium-bearing materials	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								A set of 35 uranium ore and 10 yellow cake samples, collected worldwide from different mines and production sites, were analyzed for their impurity spectrum by ICP-MS. Pattern recognition techniques such as cluster analysis were applied to the data set in order to characterize samples with relation to their geographical origin. The results obtained show a clear relationship between samples taken from the same geological origin and constitute a satisfactory fingerprint for establishing the origin of the material. In addition to the impurity data, data on the isotopic composition of radiogenic lead is used to resolve ambiguity when impurity cluster analysis fails to deliver unambiguous origin data.

Ra-226 translocation from soil to selected vegetation in the Crucea (Romania) uranium mining area	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PLANTS	A two year field survey of Ra-226 translocation from soil to selected spontaneous plants growing in the Crucea (Romania) uranium mining area is presented. Since Crucea is a large and relatively highly contaminated area, an easy and cheap way for a desired lowering of radiopollution represents phytoremediation using plentifully occurring plant species. The Ra-226 translocation from soil was affected by analyzed species, collecting sites and vegetation periods. The specific Ra-226 activities of the roots were considerably higher than the aboveground parts confirming the root tropism of radioisotopes. Mentha piperita was found to be highly effective in phytoremediation, especially in autumn.

J	Muhammad, F; Majid, A				Muhammad, Farhan; Majid, Asad			Reactivity feedback coefficients of a material test research reactor fueled with high-density U3Si2 dispersion fuels	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							PAKISTAN RESEARCH REACTOR-1; ENRICHED URANIUM FUEL; NEUTRON-FLUX; ENHANCEMENT; REDUCTION	The reactivity feedback coefficients of a material test research reactor fueled with high-density U3Si2 dispersion fuels were calculated. For this purpose, the low-density LEU fuel of an MTR was replaced with high-density U3Si2 LEU fuels currently being developed under the RERTR program. Calculations were carried out to find the fuel temperature reactivity coefficient, moderator temperature reactivity coefficient and moderator density reactivity coefficient. Nuclear reactor analysis codes including WIMS-D4 and CITATION were employed to carry out these calculations. It is observed that the average values of fuel temperature reactivity feedback coefficient, moderator temperature reactivity coefficient and moderator density reactivity coefficient from 20 degrees C to 100 degrees C, at the beginning of life, followed the relationships (in units of Delta k/k x 10(-5) K-1) -2.116 - 0.118 rho(U), 0.713 - 37.309/rho(U) and - 12.765 - 34.309/rho(U), respectively for 4.0 <= rho(U) (g/cm(3)) <= 6.0.

This benchmark problem consists of the pin and block calculations and the reactor physics of the control rod worth for the GT-MHR with a weapon grade plutonium fuel. Benchmark analysis has been performed by using the HELIOS/MASTER deterministic code package and the MCNP Monte Carlo code. The deterministic code package adopts a conventional 2-step procedure in which a few group constants are generated by a transport lattice calculation, and the reactor physics analysis is performed by a 3-dimensional diffusion calculation. In order to solve particular modeling issues in GT-MHR, recently developed technologies were utilized and new analysis procedure was devised. Double heterogeneity effect could be covered by using the reactivity-equivalent physical transformation (RPT) method. Strong core-reflector interaction could be resolved by applying an equivalence theory to the generation of the reflector cross sections. In order to accurately handle with very large control rods which are asymmetrically located in a fuel and a reflector block, the surface dependent discontinuity factors (SDFs) were considered in applying an equivalence theory. A new method has been devised to consider SDFs without any modification of the nodal solver in MASTER. All computational results of the HELIOS/MASTER code package were compared with those of MCNP. The multiplication factors of HELIOS for the pin cells are in very good agreement with those of MCNP to within a maximum error of 693 pcm Delta rho. The maximum differences of the multiplication factors for the fuel blocks are about 457 pcm Delta rho and the control rod worths of HELIOS are consistent with those of MCNP to within a maximum error of 3.09%. On considering a SDF in the core calculations, the maximum differences of the control rod worths are significantly decreased to be 7.7% from 21.5%. It is showed that there are good consistencies between the deterministic code package and the Monte Carlo code from the results of these benchmark calculations. Therefore, the HELIOS/MASTER 2-step procedure can be used as a standard reactor physics analysis tool for a prismatic VHTR. (C) 2008 Elsevier BY. All rights reserved.

Corium phase equilibria based on MASCA, METCOR and CORPHAD results	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							ZRO2-FEO SYSTEM; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; DEGREES-C; TEMPERATURES; SOLUBILITY; DIAGRAM	Experimental data on component partitioning between suboxidized corium melt and steel in the in-vessel melt retention (IVR) conditions are compared. The data are produced within the OECD MASCA program and the ISTC CORPHAD project under close-to-isothermal conditions and in the ISTC METCOR project under thermal gradient conditions. Chemical equilibrium in the U-Zr-Fe(Cr,Ni, ...)-O system is reached in all experiments. In MASCA tests the molten pool formed under inert atmosphere has two immiscible liquids, oxygen-enriched (oxidic) and oxygen-depleted (metallic), resulting of the miscibility gap of the mentioned system. Sub-system data of the U-Zr-Fe(Cr,Ni, ...)-O phase diagram investigated within the ISTC CORPHAD project are interpreted in relation with the MASCA results. In METCOR tests the equilibrium is established between oxidic liquid and mushy metallic part of the system. Results of comparison are discussed and the implications for IVR noted.

Results of the experimental campaign on contaminated metal components parameters and suggestions for safely NPP component dismantling	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								This paper concerns the dismantling activities of Caorso NPP (BWR, Boiling Water Reactor, 870 MWe, built in the 70s and fully operating in the period 1981-1986). The said plant was shut down on 1987, following Italy's poll that abrogated nuclear power use based on U235 fission. The considered activities involved an experimental campaign using plasma torch and oxyacetylene arc metal cutting processes, and regarding no radioactive materials-pipes and plates exposed to the reactor coolant steam. The performed analyses of by use contaminated components below the free release level (1 x 10(4) Bq/m(2)), not yet considering radioactivity, allowed an accurate estimation of the chemical and physical characteristics of the produced aerosol. The adopted operative conditions concerning the cut procedures are firstly described. The emissions composition and technical parameters such as cutting time and cutting rate vs. pipe diameter or plate thickness are reported. The results highlight the kind of trouble that can emerge in the cutting processes, in particular focusing on a comparison of the effects of the two cutting processes and the chemical composition of dusts collected by filtering the gaseous emission. The achievable chances connected to the adopted filtration methods are then revealed, and the obtained parameters related with the production of volatile and solid residuals for cut are reported. Some suggestions follow, finally, for a safely NPP components disassembling. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Rogante, M.] Rogante Engn Off, I-62012 Civitanova Marche, Italy; [Cesari, F.

The evaluation and monitoring procedures are based on practices at the Slovak wet interim spent fuel storage facility in NPP Jaslovske Bohunice. Since 1999, leak testing of WWER-440 fuel assemblies were completed using a special leak tightness detection system developed by Framatome-anp, "Sipping in Pool". This system utilized external heating for the precise defects determination. Optimal methods for spent fuel disposal and monitoring were designed. A new conservative factor for specifying of spent fuel leak tightness is introduced in the paper. Limit values of leak tightness were established from the combination of SCALE4.4a (ORIGEN-ARP) calculations and measurements from the "Sipping in Pool" system. These limit values are: limiting fuel cladding leak tightness coefficient for tight fuel assembly - k(FCT)(T) = 3 x 10(-10), limiting fuel cladding leak tightness coefficient for fuel assembly with leakage - k(FCT)(L) = 8 x 10(-7).

J	Choi, HJ; Choi, J				Choi, Heui-Joo; Choi, Jongwon			Double-layered buffer to enhance the thermal performance in a high-level radioactive waste disposal system	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								A thermal performance is one of the most important factors in the design of a geological disposal system for high-level radioactive wastes. According to the conceptual design of the Korean Reference disposal System, the maximum temperature of its buffer with a domestic Ca-bentonite is close to the thermal criterion, 100 degrees. In order to improve the thermal conductivity of its buffer, several kinds of additives are compared. Among the additives, graphite shows the best result in that the thermal conductivity of the bentonite block is more than 2.0 W/m degrees C. We introduced the concept of a double-layered buffer instead of a traditional bentonite block in order to use the applied additive more effectively. The thermal analysis, based upon the three-dimensional finite element method, shows that a double-layered buffercould reduce the maximum temperature on a canister's surface by 7(degrees C) under identical conditions when compared with a single-layered buffer. An analytical solution was derived to efficiently analyze the effects of a double-layered buffer. The illustrative cases show that the temperature differences due to a double-layered buffer depend on the thickness of the buffer. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Most of the depleted uranium was easily moved into the slag from the radioactive metal waste. The partitioning ratio of the depleted uranium was influenced by the amount of added slag former and the slag basicity. The composition of the slag former used to capture contaminants such as depleted uranium during the melt decontamination process generally consists of silica (SiO2), Calcium oxide (CaO) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3). Furthermore, calcium fluoride (CaF2), magnesium oxide (MgO), and ferric oxide (Fe2O3) were added to increase the slag fluidity and oxidative potential. The partitioning ratio of the depleted uranium was increased as the amount of slag former was increased. Up to 97% of the depleted uranium was captured between the ingot phase and the slag phase. The partitioning ratio of the uranium was considerably dependent on the basicity and composition of the slag. The optimum condition for the removal of the depleted uranium was a basicity level of about 1.5. The partitioning ratio of uranium was high, exceeding 5.5 x 10(3). The slag formers containing calcium fluoride (CaF2) and a high amount of silica proved to be more effective for a melt decontamination of stainless steel wastes contaminated with depleted uranium.

Various reactor deployment scenarios with SFR introductions with different conversion ratios in the existing PWR-dominant nuclear fleet have been assessed to optimize the SFR deployment strategy to replace PWRs with the view toward a reduction in the level of spent fuel as well as efficient uranium utilization through its reuse in a closed fuel cycle. An efficient reactor deployment strategy with the SFR introduction starting in 2040 has been drawn based on an SFR deployment strategy in which burners are deployed prior to breakeven reactors to reduce the amount of PWR spent fuel substantially at the early deployment stage. The PWR spent fuel disposal is reduced in this way by 98% and the cumulative uranium demand for PWRs to 2100 is projected to be 445 ktU, implying a uranium savings of 115 ktU. The SFR mix ratio in the nuclear fleet near the year 2100 is estimated to be approximately 35-40%. PWRs will remain as a main power reactor type until 2 100 and SFRs will support waste minimization and fuel utilization.

The cross-correlation functions are unique for given material-geometry configuration, thus represent signatures that can be used for the identification of radioactive materials. The measurement technique allows for the collection of fast coincidences within a time window of the order of a few tens of nanoseconds. A digital pulse shape discrimination technique is used, which allows for the accurate acquisition of the coincidences in all particle combinations. Specifically, separate neutron-neutron, neutron-gamma-ray, gamma-ray-neutron, and gamma-ray-gamma-ray coincidences are acquired with two liquid scintillation detectors. The measurements are compared to results obtained with the MCNP-PoliMi code, which simulates neutron and gamma-ray coincidences from a source on an event-by-event basis. This comparison leads to relatively good qualitative agreement. The measurements and simulations of the separate neutron and gamma-ray contributions to the total cross-correlations provide new signatures that can be obtained using existing experimental systems built to accurately identify nuclear materials. This research has direct applications in the areas of nuclear nonproliferation and homeland security. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Neutrons produced in the detector components are one of the main factors that can limit detector sensitivity. Estimation of the background from this source then becomes a crucial task for designing future large-scale detectors. Energy spectra and production rates for neutrons coming from radioactive contamination are required for all materials in and around the detector. In order to estimate neutron yields and spectra, the cross-sections of (alpha, n) reactions and probabilities of transitions to different excited states should be known. Cross-sections and transition probabilities have been calculated using EMPIRE2.19 for several isotopes, and for some isotopes, a comparison with the experimental data is shown. The results have been used to calculate the neutron spectra from materials using the code SOURCES4A. Neutron background event rates from some detector components in a hypothetical dark matter detector based on Ge crystals have been estimated. Some requirements for the radiopurity of the materials have been deduced from the results of these simulations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Tomasello, V.; Kudryavtsev, V.

This paper discusses the application of statistical signal processing techniques to the random pulse trains generated by radiation detectors. The aims of the presented algorithms are: (i) continuous, on-line estimation of the underlying time-varying count rate theta(t) and its first-order derivative d theta/dt; (ii) detection of abrupt changes in both of these quantities and estimation of their new value after the change point. Maximum-likelihood techniques, based on the Poisson probability distribution, are employed for the on-line estimation of theta and d theta/dt. Detection of abrupt changes is achieved on the basis of the generalized likelihood ratio statistical test. The properties of the proposed algorithms are evaluated by extensive simulations and possible applications for on-line radiation monitoring are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

JET EFDA Contributors	A method for digital processing of pile-up events in organic scintillators	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Digital processing; Pile-up events; Organic scintillators	NEUTRON	Pile-up events in radiation detectors are those in which two or more pulses partly or completely overlap. In standard analog electronics pile-up events are rejected using a pile-up inspector. When digital acquisition techniques are used, the recorded waveforms of pile-ups can be elaborated and the contributing single pulses reconstructed. A method for the off-line digital processing of pile-ups from liquid organic scintillators (NE213) is proposed: pile-ups in which the overlapping pulses are separated more than 15 ns can be reduced to single pulses and then correctly identified as neutrons (n) or gammas (gamma). An analysis of the errors introduced by the method is carried out. The method has been applied to data acquired in the mixed n-gamma field of JET deuterium plasma discharges from the NE213 detector in the central line of sight of the neutron profile monitor and the results are described.

Evaluation of uncertainty and detection limits in radioactivity measurements	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Uncertainty; Detection limit; Decision threshold; Radioactivity		The uncertainty associated with the assessment of the radioactive content of any sample depends on the net counting rate registered during the measuring process and on the different weighting factors needed to transform this counting rate into activity, activity per unit mass or activity concentration. This work analyses the standard uncertainties in these weighting factors as well as their contribution to the uncertainty in the activity reported for three typical determinations for environmental radioactivity measurements in the laboratory. It also studies the corresponding characteristic limits and their dependence on the standard uncertainty related to those weighting factors, offering an analysis of the effectiveness of the simplified characteristic limits as evaluated by various measuring software and laboratories.

The important scientific advances have stemmed from a large number of facilities. Previously existing stable beam machines have been adapted to produce rare isotope beams and dedicated facilities have come on-line. This talk gives an overview of the present European installations highlighting their complementary nature. The European roadmap calls for the construction of two next generation facilities: FAIR making use of projectile fragmentation and EURISOL based on the ISOL technique. The future FAIR facility will be described and the path towards EURISOL presented in the light of the construction of "intermediate" generation facilities SPIRAL2, HIE ISOLDE and SPES and results from the ongoing EURISOL Design Study.

The CARIBU project uses such a large gas catcher to create beams of neutron-rich isotopes from a Californium source for post-acceleration through the ATLAS superconducting linac to open new research Opportunities for nuclear structure physics and astrophysics. The RF gas catcher developed at Argonne has now demonstrated operation at the high intensity required for this application. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

RIB production by photofission in the framework of the ALTO project: First experimental measurements and Monte-Carlo simulations	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th International Conference on Electromagnetic Isotope Separators and Techniques Related to their Applications	JUN 24-29, 2007	Deauville, FRANCE			Photofission; Monte-Carlo simulations; Radioactive ion beams; Production Yields; Uranium carbide targets; ISOL technique	ION-SOURCE; TARGETS; FISSION; ONLINE; RELEASE; YIELDS; SEPARATION; BEAMS	The ALTO facility (Accelerateur Lineaire aupres du Tandem d'Orsay) has been built and is now under commissioning. The facility is intended for the production of low energy neutron-rich ion-beams by ISOL technique. This will open new perspectives in the stud), of nuclei very far from the valley of stability. Neutron-rich nuclei are produced by photofission in a thick uranium carbide target (UCx) using a 10 mu A. 50 MeV electron beam. The target is the same as that already had been used oil the previous deuteron based fission ISOL setup (PARRNE [F. Clapier et al.. Phys. Rev. ST-AB (1998) 013501.]). The intended nominal fission rate is about 10(11) fissions/s. We have Studied the adequacy of a thick carbide uranium target to produce neutron-rich nuclei by photofission by means of Monte-Carlo simulations. We present file production rates in the target and after extraction and mass separation steps. The results from Monte-Carlo simulations arc compared to experimental data either with the ALTO facility (in the first step of commissioning. i.e. 100 nA of the electron beam current intensity), or with fast-neutron-induced fission generated from a 26 MeV deuteron beam. The results obtained support the Suitability of FLUKA simulation code used to describe all the photofission process with an electron beam energy of 50 MeV. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
