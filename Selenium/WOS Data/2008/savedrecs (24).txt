J	Nagano, K				Nagano, Koji			An assessment of spent nuclear fuel storage demands under uncertainty	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								This paper attempts to draw quantitative prospects of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) management in Japan, with emphasis on uncertainty of storage needs for SNF up to the year 2050. In a medium term up to the years 2020-2030, the storage need for SNF can be projected with relatively high accuracy as it steadily increases up to the level of 5000 tonnes of uranium (tU), which requires timely deployment of storage facilities accordingly. In a longer term up to 2050, a number of aspects may give influences on the SNF management strategy, which are analyzed in different sets of scenario assumptions. The results of quantitative simulation runs showed that the storage need for SNF will increase up to the level of 10,000 tonnes of heavy metals (tHM) in the Base Case, while it would further grow to 20,000-25,000 tHM in the Risk Management Cases. Careful attentions should be given to the point that not just quantity but characteristics of SNF to be stored will differ significantly among the simulation cases, such as from lower to higher burnup, uranium and MOX (mixed oxide) fuels. The results imply Japan's SNF management may require elaborate strategies, which consists of effective and timely measures into the future. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Koga, T; Tominaga, Y				Koga, Tomonari; Tominaga, Yasuhiko			Heat removal characteristics of a concrete cask by a simplified test model	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								The present study is concerned with the characteristic cooling flow in the annular gap of a concrete cask used to store spent nuclear fuel. The concrete cask is cooled by a natural convection flow of air passing through an internal annular gap between the outside of a canister and the inside of the concrete vessel. The beat transfer coefficient and friction loss coefficient of such a flow could not be fully estimated even if we used existing handbooks, because the airflow has unique features. Simulation experiments using a simplified model for the cooling path have been conducted to estimate the heat transfer coefficient and friction loss coefficient. It was found by this study that the heat transfer coefficient well agreed with the prediction by an empirical formula applied to the free convection, and the friction loss coefficient was 2-2.5 times the value of an isothermal flow.

This paper describes the results under a normal condition of spent fuel storage. In the tests, data on heat removal performance and integrity of cask components were obtained for different storage periods. The change of decay heat of spent fuel was simulated using electric heaters. Reinforced concrete cask (RC cask) and concrete filled steel cask (CFS cask) were the specimen casks. Decay heat at the initial period of storage 60 years of storage, the middle period (20 years of storage), and the final period (40 years of storage) correspond to 22.6 kW, 16 kW and 10 kW, respectively. Quantitative temperature data of the cask components were obtained as compared with their limit temperature. In addition, heat balance data requested for heat removal analyses were obtained.

The canister is filled with helium gas and its containment shall be maintained and inspected during storage. The helium gas enhances heat removal from spent fuel. When the helium gas leaks, the effect of helium gas convection is weakened in the canister. Thereof, the temperature on the canister surface changes. In present tests, it was found that temperatures of the center of the top and the bottom on the canister surface change remarkably during the helium gas leak. Therefore, we defined the temperature difference as Delta T-BT. And one can detect helium gas leak using the change of Delta T-BT. Delta T-BT increases monotonously toward a constant value during helium gas leak, even if the inlet air temperature drops. The helium gas leak can be detected at the early stage of the leak by observing both Delta T-BT and inlet air temperature. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Mayuzumi, M; Tani, J; Arai, T				Mayuzumi, M.; Tani, J.; Arai, T.			Chloride induced stress corrosion cracking of candidate canister materials for dry storage of spent fuel	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								Susceptibility to chloride induced stress corrosion cracking (ESCC) of candidate canister materials, UNS 531260 and UNS S31254 stainless steels (SS), was investigated by a constant load test in air at temperatures of 343 and 353 K with relative humidity (RH) of 35%, and at 373 K without controlling RH. UNS 531260 and UNS S31254 SS did not fail until 37,700h at 353 K with RH=35%, where UNS 530403 SS failed within 250-500 h. The same tendency also was obtained at 343 K, suggesting the superior ESCC resistance of UNS S31260 and UNS 531254 SS. Even rust was not observed on the specimens tested at the temperature of 373 K. To explain the higher ESCC resistance, the pitting potential was measured in the saturated synthetic sea water at temperatures from 303 to 353 K, since ESCC is usually associated with localized corrosion such as pitting and may be closely related to the corrosion resistance. The pitting potentials of UNS 531260 and UNS S31254 SS were much higher than that of UNS S30403 SS. Thus, it was concluded that the superior ESCC resistance is attributable to the higher resistance of UNS S31260 and UNS S31254 SS to pitting corrosion. The critical relative humidity for ESCC, under which no ESCC occurs, is equal to or higher than 15% at temperatures < 353 K judging from ESCC behavior of UNS 530400 SS. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Post-irradiation examinations focused on fuel integrity of spent BWR-MOX and PWR-UO2 fuels stored for 20 years	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								Post-irradiation examinations (PIES) of spent BWR-MOX and PWR-UO2 fuel rods irradiated in commercial LWRs and stored for 20 years were carried out to evaluate fuel integrity during storage. Average burn-up of five fuel rods of the BWR-MOX fuel was about 20 MWd/kgHM and that of the PWR-UO2 fuel was 58 MWd/kgHM. The PIE items included: (a) visual inspection of the cladding surface, (b) puncture test, (c) ceramographic observation on the pellet and cladding, (d) pellet density, (e) electron probe microanalysis of the pellet, (f) cladding tensile test, (g) hydrogen content and hydride orientation in the cladding, and (h) hydrogen redistribution in the cladding under temperature gradient. The PIE results showed no marked difference in the visual inspection, fission gas release, oxide layer thickness, pellet microstructure, and cladding mechanical properties or hydride orientation after storage. The result of the hydrogen redistribution experiment showed that hydrogen migration had little effect on the fuel integrity during dry storage. Hydrogen migration on the fuel rod for 40 years of storage was evaluated using the heat of transport obtained in the hydrogen redistribution experiment and calculated result showed that hydrogen migration had little effect on the fuel integrity during dry storage.

To achieve the monitoring, Kr-85 gas was newly adopted as a kind of probe. In the case of a fuel rod defect, Kr-85 gas of the fuel rod is leaked in the canister. By detection of gamma ray (514 keV) emitted from Kr-85 outside of the canister, defected rods can be detected without unsealing the canister. The monitoring technique was developed using small-scaled mock-up experiments and simulated calculation. The result showed that Kr-85 gas leakage of about 10(11) Bq is detectable under the noise gamma rays by using the detection system with collimator, which is about 10% of Kr-85 inventory in a fuel rod. Therefore, this monitoring technique is considered as an inspection method prior to transportation of spent fuel from an interim storage facility to a reprocessing plant. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Development of a cryogenic gas target system for intense radioisotope beam production at CRIB	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						RI beam production; gas target	SEPARATOR CRIB	A cryogenic gas target system was developed for the radioisotope (RI) beam production at CNS Radio Isotope Beam separator (CRIB). Hydrogen gas was cooled to 85-90 K using liquid nitrogen and used as a secondary beam production target having a thickness of 2.3 mg/cm(2). An intense Be-7 beam (2 x 10(8) particles per second) was successfully produced using this target. We observed a density-reduction effect at the gas target for high-current primary beams with about 7.5W heat deposition. One main feature of the target system is forced circulation of the target gas. We have found that the circulation of the target gas at a rate of 55 standard liters per minute (slm) was effective in eliminating the density reduction. The extent to which the forced flow can prevent the density reduction had not been known well. In this work, the relation between the density reduction and the forced circulation rate was quantitatively studied. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The beam is produced using an offline technique. Typical analyzed beam intensities are about 2 ppA, using cathodes with an activity of the order of 200 MBq. The Be-7 implantation has been used for both fundamental nuclear physics and applied physics. In particular, different metals have been implanted with Be-7 in order to study the influence of the chemical composition and of the number of quasi-free electrons of the host material on the Be-7 half-life. In the field of applied physics, the Be-7 implantation turns out to be very interesting for wear measurement. In fact, in this case Be-7 is used as a depth-sensitive tracer. The continuous detection of the sample activity during the wear allows a high sensitivity measurement of wearing speed. The Be-7 beam production at CIRCE, the implantation procedure and the results obtained from the Be-7 half-life measurements and the wear characterization of implanted steel samples are described.

During the first one and a half year of operation, the viability of the system for the measurement of Be-10, C-14, I-129 and plutonium isotopes, Pu-239 and Pu-240, has been evaluated. First results have demonstrated that, in terms of precision and detection limits, the performance of the device compares to other compact AMS facilities, although some progress can still be done in order to optimize its capacities. At this moment, background levels are in the order of 10(-14) for Be-10/Be-9, 10(-13) for I-129/I-127, 10(-15) for C-14/C-12 (processed and unprocessed blank) and about 10(6) atoms for plutonium, isotopes: Pu-239, Pu-240 and Pu-242. In this work, the current status of the AMS measurements at CNA for the above mentioned radionuclides is described. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Chamizo, E.; Lopez-Gutierrez, J.

While anthropogenic (236)U is, therefore, present in spent nuclear fuel at levels of (236)U/U up to 10(-2), the expected natural ratios in the pre-anthropogenic environment range from 10(-14) to 10(-10). At VERA, systematic investigations suggest a detection limit below (216)U/U = 5 x 10(-12) for samples of 0.5 mg U, while chemistry blanks of similar to 2 x 10(7) atoms (236)U per sample limit the sensitivity for smaller samples. We have found natural isotopic ratios in uranium reagents separated before the onset of human nuclear activities, in uranium ores from various origins and in water from a subsurface well in Bad Gastein, Austria. Anthropogenic contamination was clearly visible in soil and rivulet samples from Salzburg, Austria, whereas river sediments from Garigliano river (Southern Italy) were close to the detection limit. Finally, our natural in-house standard Vienna-KkU was calibrated against a certified reference material (IRMM REIMEP-18 A). (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effects of the behaviour of the proton-induced isotopes production on the analysis of ancient alloys	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th European Conference on Accelerators in Applied Research and Technology	SEP 03-07, 2007	Florence, ITALY	Univ Florence, Dept Phys, Ist Nazl Fis Nucl		IBA; energetic protons; cross section behaviour effect; core analysis; PAA	ACTIVATION-ANALYSIS; SURFACE-ENRICHMENT; SILVER COINS; COPPER; CORROSION; ELEMENTS	The present work concerns non-destructive ion beam analysis carried out by means of proton-beam-induced nuclear reactions in the 10-30 MeV energy range. We focused our attention on the yield distribution of the isotopes produced in the internal region of a metal alloy. This distribution, which defines the analytical region, displays, at incident energy of about 20 MeV in a bronze based alloy, a bell-shaped curve centred at about 600 mu m with an average width of about 400 mu m. By changing the incident proton energy it is possible to displace the above region in the interior of the metal body. It should be pointed out that if we neglect to take into account the correct behaviour of the isotope yield distribution in samples with surface inhomogeneities we can obtain erroneous analytical results. We describe some experiments based on proton activation analysis (PAA) carried out at the INFN-Laboratori Nazionali del Sud (LNS) in Catania where we verified the bell-shape of the radioactive isotope distribution. The resulting formulas are given for quantitative analysis. It is straightforward that, by choosing the appropriate incident proton energy, it is possible to confine the whole analytical region to the interior of the body, thus eliminating any influence of surface effects. We have called this particular approach deep proton activation analysis (DPAA). Examples of its use on archaeological artefacts are given. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Silver surface enrichment controlled by simultaneous RBS for reliable PIXE analysis of ancient coins	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th European Conference on Accelerators in Applied Research and Technology	SEP 03-07, 2007	Florence, ITALY	Univ Florence, Dept Phys, Ist Nazl Fis Nucl		PIXE; RBS; silver-copper alloys; billon; silver enrichment; silver coins	X-RAY-FLUORESCENCE; ION-BEAM ANALYSIS; ART	Evidence of silver surface enrichment of ancient silver-copper coins has been pointed out in the past years. Surface enrichment can be fortuitous or intentional. In this paper, we have investigated the cleaning procedures usually performed after excavation or in museums. We have shown that chemicals or commercial products routinely used dissolve preferentially the copper phase and consequently contribute to the silver surface enrichment. As a result, surface analyses such as PIXE or XRF can be strongly affected by this effect. By using simultaneously RBS and PIXE, it is possible to check through the silver surface enrichment and then select the reliable measurements, characteristic of the bulk composition. Results on coins recently discovered and mechanically or chemically cleaned are presented. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Powder-XRD and SEM-EDS were also applied to investigate the phases deposited on the surface of the interacted samples. The obtained results indicated a considerable removal of U from the aqueous medium mainly due to massive surface precipitation of amorphous UO2-hydroxide phases forming a relatively thick (mu m-sized) coating on the carbonate substrate. The interaction of Th with dolomitic marble surface is also intense leading to a formation of an amorphous Th-hydroxide layer of similar thickness but of significantly lower elemental atomic proportion.

Quantification and local distribution of hydrogen within Zircaloy-4 PWR nuclear fuel cladding tubes at the nuclear microprobe of the Pierre Sue Laboratory from mu-ERDA	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th European Conference on Accelerators in Applied Research and Technology	SEP 03-07, 2007	Florence, ITALY	Univ Florence, Dept Phys, Ist Nazl Fis Nucl		hydrogen; ERDA; microbeam; radioactive samples; Zircaloy-4; microstructure		Hydrogen content and its distribution in in-core materials of nuclear plants are known to have a strong influence on their behaviour, especially on their mechanical properties but also on their corrosion resistance. This point has to be largely investigated in the case of the nuclear fuel cladding (Zr based alloys) of pressurized water reactors (PWR). Two situations have been considered here, with regards to the hydrogen content and its spatial distribution within the thickness of the tubes: (1) Irradiated fuel cladding tubes after a nominal period under working conditions in a PWR core. (2) Non-irradiated fuel cladding previously exposed to conditions representative of an hypothetical "loss of coolant accident" scenario (LOCA). As far as micrometric distributions of H were required, mu-ERDA has been performed at the nuclear microprobe of the Pierre Sue Laboratory. This facility is fitted with two beam lines. In the first one, used for non-active sample analysis, the mu-ERDA configuration has been improved to reduce the limits of detection and the reliability of the results. The second one offers the unique feature of being dedicated to radioactive samples. We will present the nuclear microprobe and emphasize on the mu-ERDA configuration of the two beam lines. We will illustrate the performance of the setup by describing the results obtained for Zircaloy-4 cladding both on non-irradiated and irradiated samples. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The hydrogen and deuterium concentrations in re-deposited material were obtained by mapping a cross sectional cut of a wall sample. De-trapping and hydrogen release caused by the primary ion beam were investigated. For both the deuterium and hydrogen concentration a drop of similar to 75% was observed from an extrapolated initial value to a final steady state region. A procedure was used to determine the initial concentration. In this way a mapping of the initial deuterium concentration could be obtained. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The films of these ionic semiconductors have potential applications as solid electrolytes in modern ceramic fuel cells of second generation. The determination of the atomic composition of the films is very important because it strongly affects the chemical and thermal stability, as well as electrical properties of the films. A combination of two Ion Beam Analysis (IBA) methods was applied to obtain the atomic composition of the films. A nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) method using a low energy deuterium beam was applied to measure the oxygen content of the films. Heavy ion Rutherford backscattering (HI-RBS) method using a C-12(3+) beam was applied to measure the Yb and Zr atomic profiles of the samples. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and ellipsometry were also employed to determine structural properties and refractive index of the films, respectively. The IBA, XRD and the ellipsometry supply a wide range of information about the film layers, which can be used for qualification as well as for feedback to the films production.

Shielding calculations for a spent fuel storage cask: A comparison of discrete ordinates, Monte carlo, and hybrid methods	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							VESSEL NEUTRON FLUENCE; VARIANCE REDUCTION	In this study, discrete ordinates and Monte Carlo methods were applied to solve the radiation transport problem for a simplified spent fuel storage cask considering fixed neutron and gamma-ray sources. The results were compared, and the causes for their differences were investigated. In addition, a hybrid method based on the Consistent Adjoint Driven Importance Sampling (CADIS) methodology has been adopted to accelerate the Monte Carlo simulations. CADIS utilizes a deterministic adjoint function for variance reduction through source biasing and consistent transport biasing. The problem encountered and its possible solution for applying the source biasing in such a large volume source are described. Compared with the unbiased case, the computational efficiency is improved by a factor of several tens for neutron transport, and the efficiency is increased tremendously by about five orders of magnitude for gamma-ray transport. It has been demonstrated that the biasing scheme applied here is very effective in the shielding calculations for a spent fuel storage cask using the Monte Carlo method.	[Sheu, R.

Proliferation resistance of americium originating from spent irradiated reactor fuel of pressurized water reactors, fast reactors, and accelerator-driven systems with different fuel cycle options	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							AM-242M; PLUTONIUM; TRANSMUTATION; THORIUM	The three most important americium isotopes, Am-241, Am-242m, and Am-243 originate in the nuclear fuel of pressurized water reactors (PWRs), fast reactors (FRs), or accelerator-driven systems (ADSs) in a ratio of (241)AM/Am-243 between similar to 0.45/0.55 to similar to 0.85/0.15. The content of Am-242m in the spent fuel of PWRs, FRs, and ADSs is relatively small and varies between 0.08 and 4.5%. Only by dedicated breeding in Am-241 fuel and blanket assemblies could this Am-242m content be increased to similar to 7%. Only the isotope Am-241 has a relatively high alpha-particle heat production whereas the isotopes Am-242m and Am-243 have a relatively small alpha-particle heat production. All three americium isotopes are spontaneous-fission neutron emitters. In this paper the different isotopic compositions of the three americium isotopes, Am-241, Am-242m, and Am-243 are assembled for a number of fuel cycle strategies for PWRs, FRs and ADSs. Then, the critical masses, spontaneous fission neutron sources, and alpha-particle heat power of these different americium compositions are calculated. In a preignition analysis for gun systems and implosion systems, it is shown that only the implosion system would be applicable to the considered americium isotopic compositions. A subsequent thermal analysis with assumptions for the geometry and choice of materials of so-called hypothetical nuclear explosive devices (HNEDs) shows that the high alpha-particle heat power in the fissile reactor americium part would lead to such high temperatures that the surrounding chemical high explosives would melt and self-explode, and the americium metal would melt. Such HNEDs on the basis of reactor americium as fissile material would be technically unfeasible.

In the Li-reduction step, the reduction behavior of MOX was similar to that Of UO2- In the electrorefining step, the separation factor between U and Pu was 1.9 for the combination of the reduced MOX anode and the liquid cadmium cathode, which agrees well with the value obtained in previous studies. Approximately 99% of the HM (U and Pu) initially present in the anode or molten salt was detected in the electrodes or molten salt after the electrolysis. Considering the analytical error of inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy, this mass balance is reasonable. The amount of U remaining in the anode was slightly larger than that of Pu, due to the reoxidation. The U-Pu alloy ingot was successfully formed by distillation of Cd.

Experiments were performed in a shielded hot cell at the Materials and Fuels Complex at Idaho National Laboratory. The goal of these experiments was to collect, by an electrochemical process, kilogram quantities of uranium and plutonium into what is called a liquid cadmium cathode (LCC). For each experiment, a steel basket loaded with chopped spent nuclear fuel from the Experimental Breeder Reactor H acted as the anode in the electrorefiner. The cathode was a beryllium oxide crucible containing similar to 26 kg of cadmium metal (the LCC). In the three experiments performed to date, between I and 2 kg of heavy metal was collected in the LCC after passing an integrated current between 1.80 and 2.16 MC (500 and 600 A h) from the anode to the cathode. Sample analysis of the processed LCC ingots measured detectable amounts of TRUs and rare earth elements.	[Vaden, D.; Li, S. X.; Westphal, B. R.; Davies, K.

The redox peaks assigned to Am(III)/Am(0) (in Cd) were observed with the liquid Cd electrode, while the redox reactions of Am(III)/Am(II) and Am(H)lAm(O) were observed with the Mo electrode. The formal standard potential of Am(III)l Am(O) obtained with the liquid Cd electrode is more positive than those calculated for the Mo electrode at both 723 and 773 K. The potential shifts were attributed to the lowering of the activity of Am by the formation of the intermetallic compound at the interface between Cd and the molten salt. The Gibbs free energies of formation of the Am-Cd intermetallic compound, which could be AmCd6, are estimated to be -119 and -113 kJ/mol at 723 and 773 K, respectively.

The critical question in order to enhance their throughput is how to decrease the sticking coefficient of the cathode. In order to realize this purpose, the conventional steel cathode was replaced with a graphite one. The graphite cathode exhibited self-scraping behavior in which the electrodeposited uranium dendrite falls from the cathode surface on its own without any kind of mechanical operation such as a scraping and rotation of the electrode. This self-scraping phenomenon of the graphite cathode was interpreted to be due to the formation of a uranium graphite intercalation compound. In this self-scraping mechanism, uranium atoms elongate at the graphite's outermost layer by an intercalation reaction, so the deposited uranium dendrite falls off spontaneously as the gravitational force exceeds the bonding strength of the layers.

Experimental observations on the roles of the cadmium pool in the Mark-IV electrorefiner	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Pyroprocessing Research Conference	AUG 08-10, 2006	Idaho Natl Lab, Idaho Falls, ID		Idaho Natl Lab	pyrochemical processing; electrorefining spent nuclear fuel; high-temperature molten salt	MOLTEN-SALTS; SYSTEM	Idaho National Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory have developed and demonstrated a pyroprocessing technology for the U.S. Department of Energy to reprocess spent nuclear fuel. One of the key steps in the pyroprocessing was electrorefining the spent fuel in a metal form in a molten LiCl-KCl-UCl3/liquid cadmium (Cd) system using the Mark-IV, an engineering-scale electrorefiner (ER). This paper summarizes experimental observations and engineering aspects for the roles of the Cd in electrorefining spent fuel in the Mark-IV ER. It was found that the Cd pool acted as an intermediate electrode during the electrorefining process. The Cd level gradually decreased because of its high vapor pressure at the ER operating temperature. The low Cd level caused the anode assembly to electrically short with the ER vessel hardware, which resulted in difficulty determining the endpoint of uranium dissolution from the anode baskets and reduced the current efficiency. A reflux Cd vapor trap successfully prevented the Cd level from decreasing and mitigated Cd vapor deposition on the cold metal surface inside the ER.

Effect of process variables during the head-end treatment of spent oxide fuel	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Pyroprocessing Research Conference	AUG 08-10, 2006	Idaho Natl Lab, Idaho Falls, ID		Idaho Natl Lab	fission product removal; head-end treatment; LWR spent fuel		The development of a head-end processing step for spent oxide fuel that applies to both aqueous and pyrometallurgical technologies is being performed by the Idaho National Laboratory, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute through a joint International Nuclear Energy Research Initiative. The processing step employs high temperatures and oxidative gases to promote the oxidation of UO2 to U3O8. Potential benefits of the head-end step include the removal or reduction of fission products as well as separation of the fuel from cladding. The effects of temperature, pressure, oxidative gas, and cladding have been studied with irradiated spent oxide fuel to determine the optimum conditions for process control. Experiments with temperatures ranging from 500 to 1250 degrees C have been performed on spentfuel using either air or oxygen gas for the oxidative reaction. Various flow rates and applications have been tested with the oxidative gases to discern the effects on the process. Tests have also been performed under vacuum conditions, following the oxidation cycle, at high temperatures to improve the removal of fission products. The effects of cladding on fission product removal have also been investigated with released fuel under vacuum and high-temperature conditions. Results from these experiments will be presented as well as operating conditions based on particle size and decladding characteristics.	[Westphal, B. R.; Bateman, K. J.; Morgan, C. D.; Berg, J.

The release characteristics of Kr-85 and C-14 fission gases during voloxidation process at 500'C are closely linked to the degree of conversion efficiency Of UO2 to U3O8 powder, and it can be interpreted that the release from grain boundary would be dominated during this step. Volatile fission gases of C-14 and Kr-85 were released to near completion during the OREOX process. Both the C-14 and Kr-85 have similar release characteristics under the voloxidation and OREOX process conditions. A higher burnup spent fuel showed a higher release fraction than that of a low burnup fuel during the voloxidation step. It was also observed that the release fraction of semivolatile Cs was similar to 16% during a reduction at 1000 degrees C of the oxidized powder, but over 90% during the voloxidation at 1250 degrees C.

In order to characterize the reduction mechanism and to investigate appropriate conditions for improving the reduction rate, several reduction tests were conducted in a LiCl-Li(2)O electrolyte at 650 degrees C using various types of cathode baskets containing 10 to 100 9 Of UO(2). The reduction progressed from the outside to the center of the cathode basket, and the reduction rate might be determined by the transportation of oxygen ion to the bulk salt. It was verified that feeding in small UO(2) particles and reducing the thickness of the UO(2) layer in the cathode basket improved the reduction rate. The completion Of UO(2) reduction was indicated by the open circuit potential of the cathode basket exhibiting lithium deposition potential for a long time. A salt distillation test was conducted using the reduction product comprising a mixture of porous uranium metal particles and the electrolyte. The reduction product loaded in an yttria crucible was heated to 1400 degrees C in an argon stream. The residue in the crucible consisted of a uranium metal ingot and a small amount of dross. The adhering LiCl seemed to be completely removed. Consequently, it was demonstrated in the electrochemical reduction followed by the salt distillation that a uranium metal ingot could be produced from the UO(2) feed with a high degree of efficiency.

Modeling the pyrochemical reduction of spent UO2 fuel in a pilot-scale reactor	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Pyroprocessing Research Conference	AUG 08-10, 2006	Idaho Natl Lab, Idaho Falls, ID		Idaho Natl Lab	oxide reduction; kinetics; pyroprocessing		A kinetic model has been derived for the reduction of oxide spent nuclear fuel in a radial flow reactor. In this reaction, lithium dissolved in molten LiCl reacts with UO2 and fission product oxides to form a porous, metallic product. As the reaction proceeds, the depth of the porous layer around the exterior of each fuel particle increases. The observed rate of reaction has been found of to be dependent only upon the rate of diffusion of lithium across this layer, consistent with a classic shrinking core kinetic model. This shrinking core model has been extended to predict the behavior of a hypothetical, pilotscale reactor for oxide reduction. The design of the pilot-scale reactor includes forced flow through baskets that contain the fuel particles. The results of the modeling indicate that this is an essential feature in order to minimize the time needed to achieve full conversion of the fuel.

Reactive metal fuel constituents, including all of the transuranic metals and the majority of the fission products, remain in the salt as chlorides and are processed into the CWE The solidified salt is containerized and transferred to the CWF process, where it is ground in an argon atmosphere. Zeolite 4A is dried in a mechanically fluidized dryer to similar to 0.1 wt% moisture and ground to a particle-size range of 45 to 250 Am. The salt and zeolite are mixed in a V-mixer and heated to 500 degrees C for similar to 18 h to occlude the salt into the structure of the zeolite. The salt-loaded zeolite is cooled, mixed with borosilicate glass frit, and transferred to a crucible, which is placed in a furnace and heated to 925 degrees C. During this process, known as pressureless consolidation, the zeolite is converted to the final sodalite form and the glass thoroughly encapsulates the sodalite, producing a dense, leach-resistant final waste form. During the last several years, changes have occurred to the process, including particle size of input materials and conversion from hot isostatic pressing to pressureless consolidation. This paper is intended to provide the current status of the CWF process, focusing on the adaptation to pressureless consolidation. Discussions include impacts of particle size on final waste form and the pressureless consolidation cycle. A model is presented that shows the heating and cooling cycles and the effect of radioactive decay heat on the amount of fission products that can be incorporated into the CWF.

This study aims at providing a new way to minimize the amount of waste salt for a repository, while removing the high decay heat fission products [Cs, Sr, Ba, and Y including other rare earth (RE) elements] from the waste salts generated during a chloride pyroprocessing procedure. These elements were removed in consecutive order from the pyroprocessing units. First, Cs could be released in the form of an oxide gas during voloxidation Of UO2 and captured by a fly-ash filter. Then, Sr was recovered in the form of carbonate precipitates from the LiCl waste salt generated during the course of an electoreduction process, by using Li2CO3. Finally, RE elements plus yttrium in the spent LiCl-KCl waste salt generated during electrorefining were removed in the form of oxides (or oxychlorides) by using an oxygen sparging method. It was confirmed that the removal yields of each element were similar to 90% for Cs at similar to 1473 K, >99% for Sr at a molar ratio of [Li2CO3/SrCl2 = 3], and >99% for the RE elements plus yttrium. Using these successes as a basis, a reference flow sheet for removing the high decay heat elements from pyroprocessing units ispresentedin this work. Also, a salt regeneration system to minimize the amount of waste salt is proposed in this study.

In this paper, we propose a new conditioning method, named the gel-route stabilization/solidification (GRSS) method, and present a practical example of its application to fabricate a monolithic waste form for LiCl waste. The GRSS process is carried out in four steps: gelation, drying, mixing with binder glass, and heat treatment (thermal conditioning). The gel-forming material system consists of sodium silicate as a gelling agent, phosphoric acid as a catalyst/stabilizer, and aluminium nitrate as a promoter. Through the drying step, LiCl, CsCl, and SrCl2 are chemically converted into phosphate or aluminosilicate forms, depending on the Si/P/Al molar ratio. The gel products are thermally stable, and there is little possibility of a Cs vaporization up to 1200 degrees C. The final waste form, fabricated by thermally treating a mixture of the gel products and borosilicate glass frit, shows low leach rates (by a product consistency test method for 7 days), 10(-2) to 10(-3) g/m(2) (.) day for Cs and 10(-3) to 10(-1) g/m(2) (.) day for Sr, which are comparable or superior to that of a glass-bonded sodalite ceramic waste form. Also, the amount of waste loading is similar to 16%, which is double that of the zeolite process, to generate a lesser final waste volume for disposal. From these results, it could be concluded that the GRSS method can be considered as an alternative technology for a sound immobilization of chloride salt wastes.

Besides the molten salt electrorefining of nitride fuel, actinide nitride formation in and recovery from the liquid cadmium cathode is a key technology in the nitride fuel cycle with pyrochemical processing. It was found that heating a cadmium alloy containing plutonium and uranium at 973 K under a nitrogen gas stream resulted in the simultaneous nitridation of the actinides and the distillation of cadmium. Furthermore, nitride pellets were prepared from the powder recovered without any milling or granulating process. The results obtained in the present study suggested that the nitride fuel cycle with pyrochemical processing is technologically feasible for transmutation of minor actinides and advanced fast reactors.

A feasibility study for the development of alternative methods to treat a spent TRISO fuel	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Pyroprocessing Research Conference	AUG 08-10, 2006	Idaho Natl Lab, Idaho Falls, ID		Idaho Natl Lab	TRISO; breaching; HTGR	GRAPHITE; NANOTUBES	The main objectives of a TRISO treatment are to effectively breach and separate the carbon and SiC layers composing the TRISO particles. The reported technologies used to treat a spent TRISO fuel are almost identical, involving a final wet chemical process under which crushed TRISO fuel is processed to separate the coating layer fines from the kernel. Also, these processes are mainly powder processes with a secondary waste generation, and they require a corrosive solution as well as complex processing steps. Hence, two innovative processing concepts are proposed in this investigation; namely, a thermal shock and a pyrochemical process to breach the coating layers of the TRISO particle with a minimal amount of secondary waste. The preliminary results showed that the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) SiC layers, as pseudo coating layers of the TRISO fuel, exhibited very robust thermal shock behaviors even at 1300 degrees C of Delta T, but a cyclic thermal shock caused a drastic degradation of their hardness. Also, it was confirmed that the CVD SiC as well as the glassy carbon rod can be breached by a chemical reaction in a molten salt with Mg and Li, respectively. Therefore, the proposed technologies are found to be very promising for treating a spent TRISO fuel without a considerable generation of secondary wastes.

Development of pyrochemical reprocessing technology for processing the spent FBR fuels is another prerequisite. Accordingly, studies on the molten salt electrorefining process for metallic fuels and the oxide electrowinning process for oxide fuels have been carried out at the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research, Kalpakkam. A laboratory-scale argon atmosphere facilily for molten salt electrorefining process studies is operational. Using this facility, studies on all the unit operations of the process have been carried out on uranium alloys. A code, PRAGAMAN, based on thermochemical modeling has been developed to simulate the electrotransport behavior of elements during the electrorefining process. Based on our studies, the eutectic MgCl2-NaClKCl ternary salt has been proposed as the alternate electrolyte for the conventional 2CsCl-NaCl electrolyte for oxide processing. A facility to demonstrate the remotization of all the process steps of the molten salt electrorefining process flow sheet for metallic fuels at 1- to 3-kg scale is being set up. Basic electrochemical studies on the reduction behavior of the chlorides and oxychlorides of uranium and the lanthanides in molten salts have also been carried out.

This macrocycle was irradiated in nitric acid with a Cs-137 gamma source to study its radiation chemical stability. Radiation chemical yields (G) were determined by gas chromatography. The results show that the presence of uranyl nitrate has a strong influence on DCH18C6 radiation chemical stability. Indeed, the presence of this template ion increases the macrocycle stability by promoting fragments recombination. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Thorium in ilmenite and its radiological implications in the production of titanium dioxide	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								This study gives the results of measurements of (232)Th and (228)Ra in the titanium mineral ilmenite and its derived products and an assessment of related radiological issues in mineral separation and titanium dioxide production plants in India. The concentrations of (232)Th and (228)Ra in ilmenite, synthetic rutile and TiO(2) are presented along with percent distribution of the radionuclides in different stages of process. External gamma exposure rates and airborne thorium levels in plants processing such minerals are studied. The study estimated a potential external gamma exposure of 1 mSv and an inhalation dose of 0.7 mSv annually to the occupational worker due to the presence of naturally occurring radioactive material in these industries. The concentrations of the nuclides in liquid effluent and solid wastes are analysed, and disequilibria with respect to (228)Ra are observed.	[Haridasan, P. P.; Pillai, P. M. B.; Tripathi, R.

Derivation and validation of a urinary excretion function for plutonium based on occupational exposure	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							PU; INHALATION; RETENTION; WORKERS; MODELS	Formation of a three-component urinary excretion function using the data of occupational exposure cases is described. Measurement results of plutonium inhalation from two subjects over 6000 and 2500 d are used in the derivation of this function. The three-component excretion function obtained is U(t) = 0.0008e(-0.0566(t)) + 0.00009e(-0.0042(t)) + 0.00004e(-0.00008(t)). The function is therefore proposed as a reliable basis to make an uptake assessment for operational control for mixed class of plutonium dominated by M-class chronic exposure.	[Yadav, J. R.; Rao, D.

Radiological significance of cement used in building construction in Turkey	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							GAMMA-RAY SPECTROMETRY; NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; RADON EXHALATION; RADIONUCLIDE CONTENT; BY-PRODUCTS; DOSE-RATES; BANGLADESH; DWELLINGS	The activity concentration of (226)Ra, (232)Th and (40)K in seven cement types from different factories and grinding plants were measured using a gamma ray spectrometry with HPGe detector. The average activity concentrations observed in the studied cement samples (all from 141 samples) were 40.0 +/- 27.1, 28.0 +/- 20.9 and 248.3 +/- 95.0 Bq kg(-1) for (226)Ra, (232)Th and (40)K, respectively. The radium equivalent activity (Ra(eq)), the representative level index, the indoor absorbed dose rate and the corresponding annual effective dose were estimated for the potential radiological hazard of the cement. The Ra(eq) values were compared with the corresponding values for cement of different countries. The mean indoor absorbed dose rate (87.4 +/- 48.5 nGy h(-1)) is slightly higher than the population-weighted average of 84 nGy h(-1), whereas the corresponding effective dose rate (0.4 +/- 0.2 mSv y(-1)) is lower than the dose criterion of 1 mSv y(-1). The obtained results indicate no significant radiological hazards arise from using Turkish cement in building construction.

Use of faecal excretion function for quick estimation of initial and existing lung burden for occupational exposure control due to (239)Pu for S-class of intake	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							PLUTONIUM; INHALATION	Two functions namely initial lung deposition and lung retention per unit faecal excretion rate are constructed primarily based on the excretion pattern of four subjects exposed to (239)Pu. In the absence of initial clear knowledge about the class of compound inhaled, faecal to urine excretion ratio was used to infer the type of inhaled class. Trends in the urine and faecal data had suggested that the intake was due to mixed class of plutonium compound for each case. With the assumption of 1:1 mixture of plutonium M&S class inhaled compound, faecal excretion rates for only S-class intake were worked out. Uptake inferred based on their urinary data had suggested it to be of similar level within 40% of uncertainty for 5 mu m particle size distribution. Data, all the four cases, were pooled for analysis citing the similar level of intake, particle size distribution, nature and pattern of work. The function obtained was tested for S-class lung retention and faecal excretion rate value. These functions are handy tool for estimating initial lung burden and lung retention value for low level of S-class plutonium intake based on subject faecal analysis data.	[Yadav, J. R.; Rao, D.

(131)I exhalation by patients undergoing therapy of thyroid diseases	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article								In the departments of nuclear medicine, patients are treated with relatively large activities of (131)I for therapeutic purposes. The applied activities are in the range of 200-10 000 MBq. Consequently, individuals situated in the dwellings of the patients dismissed from the hospital are subjected to an external as well as an internal radioiodine exposition. Internal exposition is due to the inhalation of (131)I exhaled by the patients. In this article, the measurements of radioactivity exhaled by patients with various thyroid diseases, treated with (131)I in the department of Nuclear Medicine of the Radiological Centre in Goettingen and in the Hospital of Nuclear Medicine in Wuerzburg are presented. The measurements of activities exhaled by patients were repeated daily, up to 25 d after the treatment. In addition, the residual activities were monitored by measuring the external dose rates, and by measuring the (131)I activity in the urine of these patients. In some cases, the exhaled radioiodine was separated into three fractions: the elemental, the organically bound and the aerosol-bound iodine fraction. On the basis of the proposed measurements, the doses received by the family members of a discharged patient treated with (131)I were estimated by a model calculation.

Dosemeters had been used by miners at the uranium mine 'Dolni Rozinka' at Rozna, Czech Republic. The sampling flow-rate as declared by the producer is 4 l h(-1) and the sampling period is typically 1 month. Studied filters contained 125 +/- 6 mBq (238)U in equilibrium with (234)U and (230)Th; no (232)Th series nuclides were found. Half-time of rapid dissolution of 1.4 d for (238)U and (234)U and slow dissolution half-times of 173 and 116 d were found for (238)U and (234)U, respectively. No detectable dissolution of (230)Th was found.

Assessment of absorbed dose rate in air over plowed arable lands in Sinnar State, central Sudan	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							GAMMA-RADIATION; SOIL; RADIONUCLIDES; CS-137; K-40	The absorbed gamma-dose rate in air at a height of 1 m above ground level was calculated from activity concentrations of gamma-emitting radionuclides in arable soil samples collected from eight locations within Sinnar State using the published Dose Rate Conversion Factors. Measurements were carried out using high-resolution gamma-spectrometry. On average, the activity concentrations obtained were 38 +/- 8 ((232)Th), 17 +/- 2 ((226)Ra), 174 +/- 19 ((40)K) and 0.9 +/- 0.2 Bq kg(-1) for the fallout radionuclide (137)Cs. The average value obtained here for (232)Th is slightly higher than the corresponding world-average. The calculated absorbed dose rate in air at a height of 1 m for all sampled locations ranges from 31 to 47 nGy h(-1) with an average value of 39 +/- 7 nGy h(-1) which is characteristic of normal background radiation areas. The corresponding annual effective dose was 47.8 +/- 6 mu Sv y(-1). The major contribution to the total absorbed dose rate comes from (232)Th, which amounts to 61%. Recalculation of the absorbed dose rate-based gamma-energies of individual nuclides from uranium and thorium decay series and (40)K showed that the greater part of the absorbed dose from the uranium series is due to (214)Bi, whereas for the (232)Th series it is equally attributed to (228)Ac and (208)Tl.

Corrosion of UO2 and ThO2: A quantum-mechanical investigation	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							SEMICONDUCTING MINERAL SURFACES; ELEVATED-TEMPERATURE STM; SINGLE-CRYSTAL SURFACES; ACTINIDE OXIDE SURFACES; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; THORIUM-OXIDE; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; FUEL CORROSION; WATER-VAPOR; OXIDATION MECHANISMS	The addition of Th to U-based fuels increases resistance to corrosion due to differences in redox-chemistry and electronic properties between UO2 and ThO2. Quantum-mechanical techniques were used to calculate surface energy trends for ThO2, resulting in (111) < (110) < (100). Adsorption energy trends were calculated for water and oxygen on the stable (111) surface Of UO2 and ThO2, and the effect of model set-up on these trends was evaluated. Molecular water is more stable than dissociated water on both binary oxides. Oxidation rates for atomic oxygen interacting with defect-free UO2(111) were calculated to be extremely slow if no water is present, but nearly instantaneous if water is present. The semi-conducting nature Of UO2 is found to enhance the adsorption of oxygen in the presence of water through changes in near-surface electronic structure; the same effect is not observed on the insulating surface of ThO2.

Plutonium in monazite and brabantite: Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy study	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							X-RAY-DIFFRACTION; CHEMISTRY; CERAMICS; ZIRCON	The valence states of plutonium (Pu) in monazite and brabantite have been studied by using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. In the absence of charge compensators, Pu exists mainly as trivalent ions in air-fired monazites and only trivalent ions in argon-fired monazites. However, with added Ca2+/Pb2+ as charge compensators Pu can exist as tetravalent ions. Published data on absorption spectra of both trivalent and tetravalent Pu ions in the monazite structure have been extended to the mid near infrared region (4000 cm(-1)). (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
