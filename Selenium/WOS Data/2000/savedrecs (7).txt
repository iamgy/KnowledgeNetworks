Because iodine is not incorporated into igneous rocks, the age-signal associated with I-129 permits the determination of the origin of volatiles within are volcanic systems. We report here results of a study to test the application of I-129 in fluids collected from hotsprings, crater lakes, fumaroles and geothermal wells from the Central American volcanic are. Both the Momotombo geothermal field in Nicaragua and the Miravalles geothermal field in Costa Rica show I-129/I ratios consistent with magmatic contributions from subducted marine pelagic sediments (minimum iodine ages of 25-30 Ma). In addition, several wells provide iodine isotopic ratios indicative of an older end-member, presumably located in the shallow crust (minimum iodine age = 65 Ma). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

We propose to use AMS to determine the production rate of Ti-44 by the main channel believed to be responsible for Ti-44 astrophysical production, namely Ca-40(alpha, gamma). A preliminary experiment conducted at the Koffler 14UD Pelletron accelerator demonstrates a sensitivity of 1 x 10(-14) for the Ti-44/Ti ratio. The AMS detection was performed using Ti-44(-) ions sputtered from a TiO2 sample, reducing considerably the Ca-44 isobaric interference. The present limit corresponds effectively to 44Ti production with resonance strength in the range 10-100 meV for a one-day Ca-40(alpha, gamma) activation, Several such resonances are known to be responsible for Ti-44 production in the astrophysical temperature range and should be amenable to experiment with the proposed method.

It is based on the use of thick targets and large area double-sided silicon strip detectors (DSSDs) to detect the recoiling light-charged particles and to determine precisely their scattering angle. The first nuclear physics experiments with the technique have been performed recently at the Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility (HRIBF) at Oak Ridge with stable beams of (17)O and radioactive beams of (17)F. Th, high-quality resonance measurements obtained demonstrate the capabilities of the technique. Pure (17)F beams from HRIBF were produced by fully stripping the ions and separating the interfering and more abundant (17)O ions by the beam transport system. The removal of interfering isobars is one of the various common challenges to both accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) and radioactive ion beam (RIB) production. Experiments done with RIBs wilt benefit from the use of the most efficient techniques for production, isobar separation, transport and detection. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Depth profiles have been measured in carbon samples cut from the first wall tiles of the Garching fusion experiment ASDEX-Upgrade and of the European fusion experiment JET, Culham/UK. Tritium contents in the JET samples were up to six orders higher than in samples from ASDEX-Upgrade.

It has been distributed in the environment as a result of nuclear activities including nuclear explosions, accidents at nuclear plants, dumping of nuclear waste and releases from nuclear facilities. U-236 is a potentially useful tracer of irradiated uranium for nuclear safeguards or other applications, due to its virtual absence in natural samples (U-236:U-238 ratio similar to 10(-10) in uranium ore). We have measured U-236 in soil and sediment reference materials (IAEA 375, 135 and 300) by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). The AMS system on the ANTARES accelerator has been upgraded to make such measurements possible. The system, including sample preparation procedures, is described and the results discussed.

H-3 and C-14 formed an important part of the beta-activity of these dumped wastes. Because of its long half-life, 14C will be the main constituent in possible leakages from the wastes in the future. On the other hand, C-14 and I-129 are important radioactive tracers which have been artificially introduced into the oceans. Small amounts of C-14 and I-129 can be easily measured by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) on mg-size samples of carbon and iodine extracted from 500 mi seawater samples. The high analytical sensitivity enables one therefore to find even trace amounts of C-14 and I-129 which could be released from radioactive wastes, and to compare the measured levels with the global distribution of these radionuclides. The IAEAs Marine Environment Laboratory (IAEA-MEL) has been engaged in an assessment program related to radioactive waste dumping in the oceans since 1992 and has participated in several expeditions to the Atlantic, Arctic, Indian and Pacific Oceans to sample seawater, biota and sediment for radiological assessment studies. In the present paper, we report on methods of C-14 and I-129 measurements in seawater by AMS and present data on the NE Atlantic, the Arctic and the NW Pacific Ocean dumping sites. A small increase of C-14 was observed at the NE Atlantic dumping site. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Preliminary measurements have been made using the +4 and +5 charge states at 2.1 MV with a gas stripper. The current system employs a 90 degrees injection magnet (r = 0.36 m) following the ion source. Analysis components following the accelerator include an electrostatic quadrupole doublet lens, a 15 degrees electrostatic deflector (r = 1.25 m), a 90 degrees analysis magnet (r = 1.27 m) and a 77 degrees spherical electrostatic analyzer (r = 2.0 m). Detection of I-129 is accomplished with a silicon surface barrier detector. Operation of this system with Various iodine samples will be discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we report on the status of work at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) to develop a capability for actinide measurements by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) to take advantage of the high potential of AMS for rejection of interferences. This work demonstrates that the LLNL AMS spectrometer is well-suited for providing high sensitivity, robust, high throughput measurements of plutonium concentrations and isotope ratios. Present backgrounds are similar to2 x 10(7) atoms per sample for environmental samples prepared using standard alpha spectrometry protocols. Recent measurements of Pu239+240 and Pu-241 activities and Pu-240/Pu-239 isotope ratios in IAEA reference materials agree well with IAEA reference values and with alpha spectrometry and recently published inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) results. Ongoing upgrades of the AMS spectrometer are expected to reduce backgrounds below 1 x 10(6) atoms per sample while allowing simplifications of the sample preparation chemistry. These simplifications will lead to lower per-sample costs, higher throughput, faster turn around and, ultimately, to larger and more robust data sets. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

We propose to apply the method of burial dating to prehistoric sites using the decay of in situ produced radioisotopes Be-10 and Al-26. The Tabun Cave, Mt. Carmel (Israel) has a sedimentary sequence which represents the type section for about the last 800,000 years in the Levant. The sediments in the cave are mainly of aeolian origin and are rich in quartz. Flint tools are also found in the sediments. Sediment samples and flint tools were selected from the same layer. Physical and chemical procedures to extract Be-10 and Al-26 atoms from the quartz fraction of the sediments and from the flint samples were developed, while measuring the natural Al levels as a monitor of the atmospheric component of the cosmogenic nuclides. AMS measurements were performed at the 14UD Pelletron Koffler Accelerator Laboratory, Weizmann Institute, and sensitivities of the order of 1 x 10(-14) in isotopic abundances for both Be-10 and Al-26 respectively (corresponding to similar to5 x 10(5) atoms) were obtained. First, measurements of a number of Tabun Cave sediment samples and flints show that Be-10 and Al-26 analyses have the potential for dating prehistoric cave sediments, provided problems relating to the presence of relatively large amounts of stable Al can be solved, as well as obtaining a better understanding of the burial history of the flints prior to being brought into the cave.

Cesium-137 (Cs-137) concentrations in the NGG also were determined. The background fluxes for Cl-36 for each glacial site were similar: (1.6 +/- 0.3) x 10(-2) atoms/cm(2) s for the UFG samples, (0.7 +/- 0.1) x 10(-2) atoms/cm(2) s for the NGG samples, and (0.4 +/- 0.1) x 10(-2) atoms/cm(2) s for the Dye-3 samples. The Cl-36 fluxes in ice that was deposited as snow during peak atmospheric nuclear weapon test (1957-1958) were (33 +/- 1) x 10(-2) atoms/cm(2) s for the UFG site, (291 +/- 3) x 10(-2) atoms/cm(2) s for the NGG site, and (124 +/- 5) x 10(-2) atoms/cm(2) s for the Dye-3 site. A weapon test period Cs-137 concentration of 0.79 +/- 0.05 Bq/kg in the NGG ice core also was detected in the same section of ice that contained the largest Cl-36 concentration.

Production by nucleon spallation, negative muon capture, and fast muon reactions can be approximated as exponential functions of depth, up to similar to 5000 g cm(-2). These production rates are used to date a similar to 10 m profile of eroded terrace sediments to 1.50(+0.32)/(-0.25) Ma. The measured [Be-10] profile and the terrace age agree well with expectations, demonstrating feasibility of the technique. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In addition, tanks were stored 1780 m underground to quantify He-3 contributions from decay of "inherited" tritium initially present in the water. After analyses of He-3 and Be-10, both the summit and tunnel H-3-He-3 tanks were redegassed and stored underground for an additional year. The stored summit tanks were then analyzed to determine cosmogenic H-3 levels by the He-3 ingrowth method, and the tunnel tanks used to re-determine inherited tritium. Production rates (in atoms per g H2O per year) for direct production of He-3 and Be-10 were 1824 +/- 52 and 112 +/- 9; 1013 +/- 16 and 70 +/- 5; and 134 +/- 58 and 5.9 +/- 0.7 at the three elevations, respectively. We determined production ratios of 0.32 +/- 0.08 for H-3:He-3 and 20.2 +/- 1.5 for (H-3+He-3): Be-10. Our Be-10 production rates, when normalized for interlaboratory calibration and for differences in geomagnetic latitude of exposure, are somewhat lower than results of a similar experiment undertaken by Nishiizumi et al. (1996). Our H-3:He-3 ratio is consistent with theoretical and meteorite estimates (Kruger and D. Heymann, 1968), but considerably lower than values assumed in many exposure age studies of igneous rocks (e.g., (Kurz, 1986; Trull et al., 1995)). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The measurement of (14)C is Of most interest to biomedical researchers but few studies have been reported using AMS in drug discovery and development. For biomedical use, (14)C is incorporated into organic molecules by either radiosynthesis or biosynthetically and the isotope is used as a surrogate for the distribution of the radiolabelled molecule either in animal or human studies. The majority of users of (14)C quantitate the radioactivity using decay counting usually with a liquid scintillation counter (LSC). Our Centre over the past 12 months has been evaluating and validating the use of AMS as an alternative detection method. In vitro spiking studies of human plasma with (14)C-Fluconazole, a prescription antifungal drug has demonstrated an excellent correlation between AMS and LSC (correlation coefficient 0.999). Human Phase I clinical studies have been conducted with radioactive doses ranging from 120 Bq (7000 dpm) to 11 kBq (300 nCi) to provide mass balance, plasma concentration and radioactive metabolite profiling data. Limits of detection of 0.00022 Bq (14)C-labelled drug/ml plasma have been accurately quantitated in a plasma background of 0.0078 Bq/ml (0.013 dpm/ml in a plasma background of 0.47 dpm/ml or 2.72 pMC in a background of 90.19 pMC).

However, the incorporation of Al into fetuses and sucklings in the periods of gestation and lactation has not been well clarified because Al lacks a suitable isotope for a tracer experiment. In this study, we used (26)Al (a radioisotope of Al with half-life of 716,000 yr) as a tracer, and measured (26)Al incorporation into fetuses and sucklings by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). To investigate Al incorporation into fetuses through transplacental passage, (26)Al ((26)AlCl(3)) was subcutaneously injected into pregnant rats on day 15 of gestation. (26)Al was also subcutaneoulsy injected into lactating rats from day 1 to day 20 postpartum. By day 20 of gestation, 0.2% of the 26Al injected into a pregnant rat had been transferred to the fetuses, and (26)Al was detected in the brain and liver of the fetuses. On day 9 postpartum, high levels of (26)Al were demonstrated in the brain, liver, kidneys and blood of suckling rats. It is concluded that (26)Al subcutaneously injected into pregnant rats and/or lactating rats is incorporated into their offspring through transplacental passage and/or maternal milk.

For example, F-17, is principally released from Al2O3 target-material as (AlF)-F-17. Because of the low probability of simultaneously dissociating such molecular carriers and efficiently ionizing their atomic constituents with conventional hot-cathode, electron-impact ion sources, species of interest are often distributed in several mass channels in the form of molecular side-band beams. Consequently, beam intensities of the desired radioactive species are diluted. The sputter negative-ion beam generation technique is particularly effective for simultaneously dissociating molecular carriers and efficiently ionizing highly electronegative atomic constituents. Therefore, a new concept kinetic-ejection negative-ion source (KENIS), based on this principle, was conceived to address this problem. The source has proven to be highly efficient for simultaneously dissociating and negatively ionizing sputter-ejected atomic fluorine from cesiated surfaces. The source has been successfully employed on-line to generate high intensity F-17(-) beams for use in the astrophysics research program at the Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility (HRIBF) using the O-16(d,n)F-17 reaction. The mechanical design features, principles of operation, operational parameters, beam quality information (emittance data) and efficiencies for forming intense beams of F-17(-) during off-line and on-line operation of the source are presented in this report.

This new fuel form, referred to as evolutionary mixed oxide (EMOX), is a slight perturbation on standard mixed-oxide (MOX)fuel, and analyses show that it can be an effective plutonium management tool in existing light water reactors. The addition of a small fraction of calcia-stabilized zirconia to the uranium-plutonium oxide matrix allows for greater plutonium conversion while also providing a licensing path forward toward eventual implemetation of higher plutonium-destruction fuels. These fuels, referred to as nonfertile (NF)fuels, achieve their high destruction rates through the absence of uranium which breeds plutonium, in the fuel composition. Extensive calculations have been performed to assess the feasibility of incorporating the EMOX fuel form into existing pressurized water reactor systems, and the results are given in detail. Specifically, calculations have been made to determine the plutonium consumption achievable by the EMOX concept, and comparisons have been made of this performance to that of typical MOX and NF fuels. The results indicate that EMOX and NF fuels can provide flexibility with regard to controlling plutonium inventories in spent fuel. In addition, fabrication experiments have been conducted to determine the feasibility of fabricating suitable EMOX and NF fuels. NF and EMOX fuels have been fabricated using the solid-stare reaction method. Precursor powders were successfully blended and milled using a combination of ball milling and high-energy vibratory milling. Sintering data for EMOX fuel indicated that significant densification occurred at a temperature of 1700 degrees C.

First the energy and angular dependence of radiation escaping into the atmosphere from a source containment is determined by a detailed transport model such as MCNP. Then, an effective point source with this energy and angular dependence is used in the integral line-beam method to transport the radiation through the atmosphere lip to 2500 m from the source. An example spent-fuel storage cask is analyzed with this hybrid method and compared to detailed MCNP skyshine calculations.

A carefully engineered thermal-hydraulic design is required to remove the deposited power effectively during normal operations and remove the decay power during plant shutdown and postulated accidents. For steady-state operations and operational and anticipated transients, the design criterion is to maintain single-phase flow conditions with a margin to onset of nucleate boiling. The margin is determined based on phenomenological and geometric uncertainties associated with the design. A large margin to thermal excursion limits, such as critical heat flux and onset of flow instability, also is maintained during normal operations. In general, a very robust thermal-hydraulic design can be accomplished using the traditional models and correlations available in the engineering literature. However, two issues require further attention: maintaining adequate flows in a parallel network of flow channels and minimizing the volume fraction of heavy water to maximize tritium production. The design uses ladderlike structures that contain clad tungsten cylinders in the rungs that have coolant supplied and removed by the vertical ladder rails. Because the power density drops in the beam direction, the thickness of the tungsten cylinders is increased with increasing beam penetration length. The cooling requirement is determined using a conservative criterion where the minimum wall subcooling inside the rungs is at least 40 degrees C and the minimum Reynolds number is 6000. Initial flow distribution tests were conducted with a full-scale model of an APT ladder assembly based on a preliminary design. Flow distributions can be made more even by using a larger riser than downcomer and also by increasing the flow resistance across each rung. The calculations discussed assume nominal dimensions, even though the power deposition and removal use a conservative approach. The effect of manufacturing tolerances will be investigated in future research. Also, the applicability of the critical heat flux and onset of flow instability models to small coolant channels is being verified experimentally. Further design optimization will be possible when these studies are completed.

This causes sophisticated demands on material and geometry choices and a very careful optimization of the whole target system. Therefore, complex and detailed particle transport models and computer code systems have been developed and used to study the nuclear assessment of the ESS target system. The purpose here is to describe the methods of calculation mainly based on the Monte Carlo code to show the performance of the ESS target station. The interesting results of the simulations of the mercury target system are as follows: time-dependent neutron flux densities, energy deposition and heating, radioactivity and afterheat, materials damage by radiation, and high-energy source shielding. The results are discussed in great detail. The validity of codes and models, further requirements to improve the methods of calculation, and the status of running and planned experiments are given also.

J	Bowman, CD				Bowman, CD			Once-through thermal-spectrum accelerator-driven light water reactor waste destruction without reprocessing	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						waste transmutation; subcritical reactor; graphite-moderated reactor	TRANSMUTATION	An accelerator-driven thermal-spectrum liquid-fueled system is described for transmutation of spent fuel from commercial power reactors. The primary purpose of the system is to destroy the weapons-useful plutonium and neptunium in commercial spent fuel and thereby eliminate international concerns about the recovery of such material from geologic repositories for nuclear weapons purposes. The system also extracts similar to 80% of the fission energy available in the plutonium, and this energy is converted into electricity and sold into the commercial grid to pay nearly all of the capital and operating costs. The 20% of the material not destroyed is converted to an isotopic composition of no interest from a weapons perspective. These functions are accomplished without recycling or separation of a stream of pure plutonium. With technological development enabling widespread deployment in the 2015 to 2025 time frame, the world's inventory of nuclear weapons useful material could be reduced by a factor of 100 or more by the middle of the next century. This system does not eliminate the need for geologic storage of the remnant waste since the 20% remnant must be stored somewhere for tens of thousands of gears, but it eliminates the possibility of mining geologic repositories for weapons material, it enables the recovery of nearly all of the energy carried by the plutonium, it reduces the amount of actinides that must be permanently stored by a factor of 5 and it enhances the repository's performance by reducing the load of long-lived radioactive actinide. Furthermore, since weapons material is eliminated, it transforms the ultimate disposition of the spent-fuel waste remnant from a subject of profound international concern to one in which nations need have little interest in how others solve this problem. Most of the concerns about the waste legacy from continued light water reactor deployment would be made moot by the advent of this waste destruction technology.

The irradiations were performed in prototypic proton and neutron spectra at prototypic temperatures (50 to 160 degrees C). The study used the 800-MeV, 1.0-mA proton accelerator at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center, which produces a Gaussian beam with 2 sigma = 3 cm. The experiment geometry is arranged to contain near-prototypic modules of the tungsten neutron source and the lead and aluminum blanket as well as mechanical test specimens of candidate APT materials. The particle spectrum varies throughout the irradiation volume; specimens are exposed to protons and a variety of mixed proton and neutron spectra, depending on the specimen's position relative to the beam center. These specimens have been irradiated for >3600 h to a maximum proton fluence of 4 x 10(21) p/cm(2) in the center of the proton beam. Specimens will yield data on the effect of proton irradiation, to high dose, on material properties from tensile tests, three-point bend tests, fracture toughness tests, pressurized tubes, U-bend stress corrosion cracking specimens, corrosion measurements, and microstructural characterization using transmission electron microscopy specimens., Results from these studies are applicable to all spallation neutron sources now in operation and under consideration, including the Spallation Neutron Source, the European Spallation Source, and The Accelerator Transmutation of Waste project.

J	Cappiello, MW; Lisowski, PW				Cappiello, MW; Lisowski, PW			Target/blanket design for the accelerator production of tritium plant	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						spallation neutron source; tritium; spallation physics		The Accelerator Production of Tritium Target/Blanket (T/B) system is comprised of an assembly of tritium-producing modules supported by safety, heat removal, shielding, and retargeting systems. The T/B assembly produces tritium using a high-energy proton beam, a tungsten/lead spallation neutron source and Ne-3 gas us the tritium-producing feedstock. The supporting heat removal systems remove the heat deposited by the proton beam during both normal and off-normal conditions. The shielding protects workers from ionizing radiation, and the retargeting systems remove and replace components that have reached their end of life. All systems reside within the T/B building, which is located at the end of a linear accelerator. For the nominal production mode, protons are accelerated to an energy of 1030 MeV at a current of 100 mA and are directed onto the T/B assembly. The protons are expanded to a 0.19- x 1.9-m beam spot before striking a centrally located tungsten neutron source. A surrounding lead blanket produces additional neutrons from scattered high-energy particles. A total of 27 neutrons are produced per incident proton. Tritium is produced by neutron capture in He-3 gas that is contained in aluminum tubes throughout the blanket. The He-3/tritium mixture is removed on a semi-continuous basis for purification in an adjacent Tritium Separation Facility. Systems and components ave designed with safety as a primary consideration to minimize risk to the workers and the public. Materials and component designs were chosen based on the experiences of operating spallation neutron sources that have been designed and built for the neutron science community. An extensive engineering development and demonstration program provides detailed information for the completion of the design.

For uranium-free portions of enamel adjacent to sediment, we can determine a beta-dose gradient due to sources in the nearest 2 mm layer of the sediment. If the equivalent dose to successive layers of enamel is plotted against the beta dose rate to each layer, an estimate of the age (equal to the slope of the line) that depends only on the environmental beta dose rate can be determined. Experimental methods and results for four teeth are discussed. The significance of this approach lies in its ability to isolate an age estimate that is independent of the uranium uptake model, since only portions of the enamel which are far away enough from internal sources of uranium, such, as dentine, are used. In addition, this technique provides a time-averaged estimate of the actual gamma plus cosmic dose rate provided that a reasonable estimate of the average moisture content is used to calculate the environmental beta dose rate.

Using a soil science approach, three main phases can be distinguished, which, according to increasing stability, are: The mobile phase, which includes elements in aqueous solution or elements weakly bonded at the surface of minerals. The phase that can be mobilised, in oxides, amorphous or weakly crystallised minerals. It can possibly move. The resistant phase, which cannot move. The proportion of nuclides in the different phases, analysed together with other paedological data, can give information on the local, stability of the radioactivity and possibly allow evaluation of error limits and corrections that should be applied to the present dose rate for dating purpose. In the worst cases this can lead to the conclusion that dating would not be reliable. Two case studies show the potential of the approach, which still remains more qualitative than quantitative. In an archaeological site (Ladonx, Puy de Dome, France), streaming surface water brings radioactivity characterised by radium in excess. In volcanic tephra (La Vestide, Bas Vivarrais, France), nuclide mobility is found to be negligible; therefore observed disequilibrium in the U series pre-existed the eruption.

The samples came from a radioactive materials storage facility, with ambient dose rates of about 0.1 mGy/h. A detailed dose-depth profile was analysed from one brick, and compared with dose records from area TL dosemeters. Small-aliquot dose-distributions were analysed from the mortar samples; one associated with the exposed brick, and one from a remote site exposed only to background radiation. We conclude that unfired materials have considerable potential in retrospective dosimetry. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The differential cross-section is found to decrease with increase in the emission angle, showing an anisotropic spatial distribution of M shell fluorescence Xrays. The present results contradict the predictions of Cooper and Zare (Cooper, J., Zare, R.N., 1969. Atomic Collisions Processes, vol. XIC. Gordon and Breach, New York. p.317) that after photoionization of inner shells, the vacancy state has equal population of magnetic substates and that the subsequent X-ray emission is isotropic, but confirm the predictions of the calculations of Flugge, Mehlhorn and Schmidt that the atomic inner-shell vacancies produced after photoionization are aligned and X-ray emission from the filling of vacancies in states with J > 1/2 is anisotropic. The vacancies were created by the 5.96 keV gamma-rays from an Fe-55 source and the M X-rays were measured using a Si(Li) detector. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

It contains a lot of radioactive materials, The aqueous :medium increases their mobility so that dangerous elements persistently penetrate into the environment with ground water. This situation and recent measurements are discussed. The egress is supposed to have a diffusion nature. A model for the diffusion treatment of the active elements migrating with ground and subterranean water is proposed. The necessary diffusion coefficients are derived from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. These coefficients are expressed by singlet and pair equilibrium distribution functions to be evaluated for radioactive particles near a dielectric wall modeling the ground at various concentrations.

Irradiation was observed to enhance the rate of decomposition without modifying the mechanism of thermal decomposition. Thermal decomposition of samarium acetate has been shown to proceed by two-dimensional phase-boundary reaction both for un-irradiated and pre-gamma-irradiated samples. The enhancement of the decomposition was found to increase with an increase in the gamma-ray dose applied to the sample and may be attributed to an increase in point defects and formation of additional nucleation centers generated in the host lattice. Thermodynamic values of the main decomposition process were calculated and evaluated. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

An optimum amidoximation time of 0.75 h was selected at a weight ratio of AN to MAA (x/y) of 80/20. By varying x/y in the monomer mixture, cografted polymers were prepared. The value of x/y governed the AO group density and water content of the resultant fibrous adsorbents. As x/y increased, the AO group density of the fiber increased and its water content decreased. The AO/MAA adsorbent, based on the PP fibers prepared by cografting at an x/y of 60/40 and subsequent amidoximation, exhibited the highest uranium adsorption rate in the flow-through mode.

We describe a dedicated test zone built at CERN to test the performance and the aging of the muon chambers currently under development. A radioactive source delivers photons causing the sustained rate of random hits, while a narrow beam of high-energy muons is used to directly calibrate the detector performance. A system of remotely controlled lead filters serves to vary the rate of photons ol er four orders of magnitude, to allow the study of performance as a function of rate. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B,V.

A high-energy gamma-ray source is needed to calibrate SNO beyond the B-8 solar neutrino endpoint of 15 MeV. This paper describes the design and construction of a source that generates 19.8-MeV gamma rays using the H-3(p,gamma)He-4 reaction ("pT"), and demonstrates that the source meets all the physical, operational and lifetime requirements for calibrating SNO. An ion source was built into this unit to generate and to accelerate protons up to 30 keV, and a high-purity scandium tritide target with a scandium-tritium atomic ratio of 1:2.0 +/- 0.2 was included. This pT source is the first self-contained, compact, and portable high-energy gamma-ray source(E-gamma > 10 MeV). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Yapici, H; Akansu, SO; Ozceyhan, V				Yapici, H; Akansu, SO; Ozceyhan, V			Neutronic analysis of a moderated (D, T) fusion driven hybrid blanket	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							FISSION; FUEL	In this study, neutronic effects on (D-T) driven hybrid reactor fuelled with different mixtures of 45.5% fertile fuels, vary from 0 to 100% for uranium components and from 100 to 0% for the thorium component in the fuel mixtures. These mixtures are UF4 + THF4, UO2 + ThO2 UC2 + ThC2. The coolants are selected as flibe (Li2BeF4), natural lithium and air for the heat transfer out of the fuels zones and the clad material is selected as SS-316 stainless steel with a volume fraction ratio of 9%. The fuel zones of the hybrid reactor are investigated to obtain fissile fuel breeding (U-233 and/or Pu-239). A regeneration period of up to 48 months is investigated by a plant factor of 75% under a first wall neutron flux (phi(w)) of 2.2210(14) (14.1 MeV) n/ cm(2).s for a conventional (D,T) driven hybrid reactor. These correspond to a first wall neutron load of 5 MW/m(2). At the end of the operation periods, cumulative fissile fuel enrichment (CFFE) value varies between 6.7% in pure UF4 with flibe coolant and 3.5% in pure ThO2 with natural lithium coolant. At the beginning of the operation, the tritium breeding ratio (TBR) is higher than unity in air coolant and natural lithium coolant cases. In flibe coolant cases the TBR value can reach nearly 55% uranium component + 45% thorium components. Therefore, the hybrid blanket is self-sufficient with respect to the TBR for these cases. It is important to follow the non-prolific level of the plutonium fuel during operation because of the nuclear weapons hazard. Nuclear quality of the plutonium increases linearly during the operation period. Pu-240 content has to be higher than 5% for safety. Pu-240 content is higher than 5% in UF4 + ThF4, UC2, + ThC2 and (UO2 > 20%) + (ThO2 < 80%) with flibe coolant. This is very important criteria for safety. In natural lithium and air coolant cases Pu-240 content is lower than 5%. In these cases, the operation period must be increased for safety. U-233 is used as a fuel in thermal reactors and can be separated from the Thourium component. But this separation is too difficult in the thorium component + uranium component mixtures. Therefore, investigated hybrid blanket is safer than 100% Th component. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The hydraulic conductivity and the swelling pressure of compacted bentonite increase with increasing temperature, but the affect of temperature elevation is not large. The dissolution of organic carbon in bentonite also increases with increasing temperature, but the resultant aqueous concentrations of organic carbon in bentonite suspensions are less than those of deep groundwater in granite. Therefore, the organic carbon dissolved from the bentonite will not cause a significant increase in the organic carbon content of deep groundwater in the repository environment. Overall, temperature effects on the sealing performance of buffer material in a waste repository is not important, if the maximum temperature is maintained below 100 degrees C.

J	Zavaljevski, N; Shapiro, A				Zavaljevski, N; Shapiro, A			A Markov chain Monte Carlo inverse procedure for radioactive contaminant transport in fractured rock: 1. Forward model	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							TRANSFORM GALERKIN TECHNIQUE; MASS-TRANSPORT; MEDIA; SYSTEMS	Safety assessment of high level radioactive waste repositories requires confidence in models for radioactive contaminant transport in fractured media. An approach for contaminant transport model testing is calibration based on large-scale laboratory experiments. This paper is the first of two papers in which the calibration of a two dimensional variable fracture network model for radioactive tracers is formulated as an inverse problem using a Bayes-Markov approach. This paper gives the framework for the inverse problem and describes a novel contaminant transport model appropriate for this problem. The subsequent paper presents the details of the algorithm for the inverse problem solution. The prior information for fracture aperture distribution is assumed in the form of Markov random fields (MRF). In particular, the class of auto-models has been successful in reproducing the connectivity in extreme values of fracture apertures, and experimentally observed flow channeling. A continuous model, conditional autoregressive model, and a discrete, auto-binomial model have been applied. The mathematical model for the contaminant transport in the discrete fracture network is based on the numerical inversion of the Laplace transform. This methodology is free of numerical dispersion, but requires a large number of terms to reconstruct very steep contaminant fronts. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Inverse model	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							OPTIMIZATION; UNCERTAINTY; SYSTEMS	Model calibration for radioactive contaminant transport in fractured rock has been formulated as an inverse problem and a solution proposed using a Bayesian approach. In particular, Markov random field (MRF) models have been proposed as a priori distribution functions for fracture apertures. The fracture reconstruction is based on the a posteriori distribution function simulation using a Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure. A two-level estimation-reconstruction algorithm has been developed. Oil the first level, the fracture apertures are reconstructed using simulated annealing (SA), with the Metropolis-Hastings dynamics. The MRF parameters are assumed known. On the second level, after several sweeps of the entire field using SA, the MRF parameters are updated using the method of pseudolikelihood. The competing models are finally compared using an asymptotic form of the Bayes factor. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ziabletsev, DN; Ivanov, KN				Ziabletsev, DN; Ivanov, KN			Improved verification methodology for TRAC-PF1/NEM using NEA/OECD core transient benchmarks	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article								This paper describes the verification methodology of TRAC-PF1/NEM based on the NEA/OECD core transient benchmarks. The necessity of verification of the coupled best-estimate codes capable to predict the transient behavior of light water reactors (LWR) is well recognized. The TRAC-PF1/NEM code, currently maintained in The Pennsylvania State University (PSU), is a coupled three-dimensional (3D) neutronics/thermal-hydraulics (T-H) best-estimate code that allows simulating the postulated design basis accidents for pressurized water reactors (PWR). The nodal expansion method (NEM) is implemented in the neutronics module of TRAC-PF1/NEM. TRAC-PF1 is a system transient analysis code allowing 3D fluid dynamics vessel modeling as well as 1D balance-of-plant representations. Rod ejection/withdrawal accidents, which constitute 3D transient problems with the moving of central or peripheral control assemblies, are analyzed in this paper. It is demonstrated that the obtained results lire in the range of one neutronic node-per-assembly and one T-H cell-per-assembly reference results. it is also shown that the modifications of the thermal conductivity and heat capacity of both uranium oxide and zirconium cladding, introduced into TRAC-PF1 according to the benchmark specifications in comparison with the initial TRAC correlations, do not change the steady state and transient results. The analyzed NEA/OECD core transient benchmarks have been recently added to the developed TRAC-PF1/NEM qualification procedure. These benchmarks help to improve the verification methodology by establishing a well-defined set of test problems for future TRAC-PF1/NEM modifications and distributions.

These investigations, however, have focused exclusively on field studies aimed fundamentally at quantifying the behaviour of the radiocaesium component of the contamination. The results have shown great variability. As a contribution towards this body of knowledge, we have made a comparative study of the temporal evolution of the transfer of Sr-85 and Cs-134 via three routes of radioactive contamination - from the mycelium, from the surface layer of the soil, and directly onto the caps of the fruit bodies - for the saprophyte species, Pleurotus eryngii, under controlled laboratory conditions. The results indicate that the last of the above three uptake routes is the most efficient, and that the temporal evolution of the transfer is closely related to the radionuclide and the radioactive contamination route being considered.

Systems code studies show the cost of electricity from spherical tokamak power plants, operating at high beta in second ballooning mode stable regime, is comparable with fossil fuels and fission. Outline engineering designs are presented based on two concepts for the central rod of the toroidal field (TF) circuit - a room temperature water cooled copper rod or a helium cooled cryogenic aluminium rod. For the copper rod case the TF return limbs are supported by the vacuum vessel, while for the aluminium rod the TF coils form an independent structure. In both cases thermohydraulic and stress calculations indicate the viability of the design. Two-dimensional neutronics calculations show the feasibility of tritium self-sufficiency without an inboard blanket. The spherical tokamak has unique maintenance possibilities based on lowering major component structures into a hot cell beneath the device and these are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

It can be used to test and develop necessary fusion blanket and divertor components and provide sufficient database, particularly on the reliability of nuclear components necessary for DEMO. The VNS device can be complement to ITER by reducing the cost and risk in the development of DEMO. A low cost, scientifically attractive, and technologically feasible volumetric neutron source based on the spherical torus (ST) concept has been conceived. The ST-VNS, which has a major radius of 1.07 m, aspect ratio 1.4, and plasma elongation three, can produce a neutron wall loading from 0.5 to 5 MW m (2) at the outboard test section with a modest fusion power level from 38 to 380 MW. It can be used to test necessary nuclear technologies for fusion power reactor and develop fusion core components include divertor, first wall, and power blanket. Using staged operation leading to high neutron wall loading and optimistic availability, a neutron fluence of more than 30 MW year m(-2) is obtainable within 20 years of operation. This will permit the assessments of lifetime and reliability of promising fusion core components in a reactor relevant environment. A full scale demonstration of power reactor fusion core components is also made possible because of the high neutron wall loading capability. Tritium breeding in such a full scale demonstration can be very useful to ensure the self-sufficiency of fuel cycle for a candidate power blanket concept. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

Analysis of such spectra has been performed for different direct-drive target designs and rhoR, and the time-dependent emission and arrival to the first wall of the system are reported. On the basis of established reactor designs (first variable to be considered) such as HIBALL-II or KOYO, the realistic possibility to obtain an uniform power distribution and obtain enough tritium breeding call be demonstrated. Activation of steels, vanadium alloys and SiC based composites has been considered in comparative analysis using different neutron energy spectra showing the important energy-dependent effect and the general advantages of V-alloys and SiC composites. The correct simulation of chains leading to radiological critical isotopes (function of neutron energy) and the goodness of nuclear data are essential for final responses/conclusions, and they need to be evaluated with careful uncertainty analysis. The damage accumulation because of very intense pulsed neutron fluxes in IFE reactors needs to be well understood prior to consideration of the availability of use of some very extensively considered low-activation materials. Results on simulations performed on SIC using an accumulated dose of 2 x 10(14) recoils cm(-2) are discussed and future work planned. Activation and damage analysis will impose clear boundaries in the final design of the reactor, and the availability in IFE power plants to include liquid protections to the walls is certainly very important.

The key driven force of the ST design is caused by the center column conductor. The design selected is a water-cooled Cu normal conductor. This selection has a major impact on the blanket design and selection, tritium breeding and over-all power balance. The blanket selected is a dual coolant concept, partially decided by the characteristics of the center conductor. The final blanket design is modified from the dual coolant concept, which developed under the EC DEMO program. The reason for this selection and the design issues are summarized in this paper.
