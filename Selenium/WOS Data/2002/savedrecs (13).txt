J	Willms, RS; Rabun, R				Willms, RS; Rabun, R			US tritium activities	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	NOV 12-16, 2001	TSUKUBA, JAPAN					Since the last international tritium conference in 1995 the US continues its active interest in better understanding tritium and in using it safely and efficiently. US governmental tritium interests center around five major activities: 1) inertial confinement fusion, 2) fusion energy sciences (both magnetic and inertial), 3) tritium facility decontamination and decommissioning, 4) tritium production and 5) national defense applications. While the US interests have, roughly speaking, stayed the same, there have been significant changes in the US tritium community. There have been shifts in program emphases and changes in US tritium facilities with certain facilities either shutdown or being shutdown, and with new facilities under construction. This paper will provide an overview of the US tritium activities and associated facilities.

One of the upgraders is a combined electrolysis catalyst exchange (CECE) process that consists of 90 stages of catalytic water-hydrogen isotopic separation units. This upgrader treats 10 m(3)/y of degraded heavy water, produces reactor grade heavy water, and lowers the tritium and heavy water in the waste to <3700 Bq/cm(3) and <0.1wt%, respectively. The other one is simple electrolysis system and terminated its operation in 1999. Heavy water recycle is completed with these two upgraders in the Fugen.

The interaction between two tritons is described by the optical model. The optical potential is determined by reproducing the t + t --> alpha + n + n reaction cross section. The nuclear fusion rate obtained was in good agreement with an experimental value. The charge symmetry of nucleons is partially broken in the low energy t + t reaction by 30 %. The mechanism of the reaction is approximately described by the proton stripping reaction. We deny the possibility of the fusion through a negative parity resonant state.

The IR intensities and Raman activities of the products that might be created by beta induced reactions were calculated using Gaussian98 and the peaks of Raman and FT-IR were determined. It was found that the T2O and CO2 are so stable that the reaction products were not found in this study. Mass spectroscopy was also applied at the end of the experiment and it became clear that most of the condensed matter is tritiated water and the other substances by beta-decay reaction were not confirmed clearly.

Using the developed approach the yttrium dependence on the thermodynamic activity of tritium in the whole concentration range of Li-Pb system were studied at 400-800(0)C. The yttrium displaces the concentration boundary which separates the regions with positive and negative deviations from ideality.

Rate constants of D2O uptake in leaves of rice plant and soybean in the daytime release were 2.4 and 3.0 hr(-1), respectively, and 5-4 times higher than those in the nighttime release. Rate constants of D2O loss in leaves after daytime release were about twice those after the nighttime release. The half time of D2O loss was 0.6-0.7 hr for leaves of rice plant and soybean. After D2O release, OBD concentration in unhulled rice and soybean increased with time until 4 -5 days of the experiments and then decreased with time and the extent of decrease was remarkable in soybean pea.

In the offspring mice nursed by mother mice supplied with THO as drinking water, the largest contribution of OBT to the total accumulated dose was found in the brain. The percent contribution of OBT to the total dose distributed between 17 and 42% among various soft tissues The OBT localization to cell nuclei increases the microscopic dose to cell nuclei by a factor of 3 - 6 in the case of DNA-bound tritium in comparison with the dose estimated from the tissue-averaged tritium concentration. The tritium localization is of less importance in the case of protein-bound tritium. The blood level tritium was found to be useful and convenient for OBT dosimetry in a practical case of radiation protection of humans after acute and chronic intake of tritium. A new technique was developed to isolate mouse red bone marrow from tibia. A model experiment using mice has shown that the dose to red bone marrow in the case of oral THO intake was lower than the dose estimated for the blood pool.

There are presented in the paper the results of lichen application study for assessment of atmospheric pollution by tritium. Both tritium in tissue free water (TFWT) and organically bound tritium (OBT) were measured in lichen. Lichen species Hypogimnia physodes was used as a basic bio-indicator. Pieces of lichen were sampled within the distance of 30 km of emission source. Established sampling sites were rectangular in shape with linear dimensions 100*100 in. Lichen samples were sampled from various trees: birch tree, aspen tree, pine tree and linden tree at the level of 1.5 in above the ground. Thermal vacuum desorption technique was used to extract TFWT from lichen samples. Pyrolitic oxidation of dried lichen samples by vanadium oxide was used to extract tritium from OBT. Air monitoring stations equipped with active and passive samplers were used to sample HT and HTO from the atmosphere. Liquid scintillation counting was used to measure tritium content in water samples. It was determined that tritium content in lichen samples (both in TFWT and OBT) in vicinity of an emission source is higher than that of tritium content in lichen at distant sampling sites. Variation of tritium activity of TFWT was about 10 times, variation of tritium activity in OBT was about 70 times. It was supposed that tritium content in TFWT was in equilibrium with tritium content in atmosphere at the minute of sampling, while tritium content in OBT was determined by tritium content in atmosphere over longer period of time.

The system has been found to be 100-fold more sensitive for detecting mutations than the conventional system which uses an internal Hprt gene. The mutation frequency induced by 1 Gy of tritium radiation at different dose rates (0.9, 0.4, 0.04, and 0.018 Gy/h) was measured. No significant differences in mutation frequencies were observed within the range of dose rates used, suggesting that if a reverse dose-rate effect exists, it may not be observable with tritium radiation at dose rates over 0.018 Gy/h. Interestingly, molecular analysis of the Hprt locus in Hprt-deficient mutants induced by tritium showed that deletion sizes observed in the hamster cell's human X-chromosome under these conditions are much smaller in cells exposed at 0.04 (and 0.018 Gy/h) than in cells exposed at 0.9 Gy/h. This phenomenon seems to be specific for tritium radiation because it was not apparent after exposure to gamma-rays. The novel hyper-sensitive detection system used here is useful for analysis of the mutagenic effects of low doses of tritium radiation delivered at low dose rates.

ICRP report recommends that the dose due to OBT ingestion is 2.3 times higher than that due to HTO. Thymidine is a specific precursor of DNA. There were several reports on ingestion experiments of OBT including H-3-thymidine. However, the concentrations of tritiated compounds used in those experiments were extremely high compared with environmental tritium concentration. Therefore, in this study, we used tritiated compounds with 100 times of concentration based on the highest concentration in rain after nuclear tests during the 1960's, i.e. 700Bq tritium/l rainwater. Mice were chronically fed with each one of tritiated organic compounds, H-3-thymidine, H-3-leucine, H-3-glucose or HTO for comparison, and the excretion and distribution of tritium in mouse body and tritium uptake into DNA in each tissue were determined at 180th, 240th, and 300th day of ingestion. Almost no significant differences were found between the dose rates from DNA-bound tritium throughout long-term exposure by ingestion of tritiated organic compounds and that of HTO.

During the experiment, HT gas was continuously released to the atmosphere at the cultivated site for 12 days, and HTO and OBT concentrations in cultivated plants were measured. For plants' leaves, the conversion rate of HTO to OBT was about 0.2 (% hr(-1)), but it varied with their growth stage. A chamber experiment was also carried out in laboratory for comparison.

To estimate the dose due to internal exposure following intake of tritium, the distribution of tritium concentration has been measured with the bioassay method and the liquid scintillation counting method by using bioassay samples in man such as urine, exhaled water and so on. On the basis of their many tritium concentration data accumulated in the OKTAVIAN facility until now, a new tritium metabolic model has been developed by modifying a conventional three-compartment model known as the most famous model. The present model was verified using measured data, and compared with other models proposed previously.

In rats exposed to tritiated water (HTO) or some tritiated organic compounds by single ingestion, the concentrations of total tritium and organically bound tritium (OBT) in blood and various organs were determined at various time intervals after ingestion. The concentrations of total tritium in blood showed a tendency to be higher than those in the majority of organs. When the cumulative doses to blood and organs for 100 days after ingestion of various tritiated compounds were compared, the doses to blood were almost the same or higher as compared with the maximum doses to organs. These results indicated that blood analyses would be useful to estimate a maximum of internal doses for exposure to tritium in various chemical forms. It was also suggested that the concentration ratio of OBT to total tritium in blood could be used to deduce the chemical form of tritium at exposure and the elapsed time after exposure.

Modeling is the only method to obtain such assessment without any environmental contamination. The current paper describes the TRIEF model designed to assess consequences of long-term atmospheric tritium emission for such environmental compartments as atmosphere, soil, plants; tritium contamination of ground and underground water is also included. The model takes into account tritium transport among all of the compartments. The model has been successfully validated in model-experiment intercomparison study in framework of the IAEA co-ordinated research programme "BIOMASS" on assessment of environmental contamination from the continuous source of atmospheric tritium release. The experimental data included tritium concentrations in the atmospheric moisture, vegetation, soil and the overlying snow cover. The modelling period was 20 years. Most of the predicted values agreed with observations within experimental uncertainties, which were a factor of 2. The TRIEF model is based on both HTO equilibrium and material balance approach in all the compartments. Average concentrations in atmosphere are calculated by using the Gauss-type model for primary and secondary source. HT and HTO behavior are modeled separately. Both wet and dry deposition of HTO is taken into account in case of HTO emission. HTO concentration in soil moisture is determined by the moisture balance equation. HTO concentration in plant tissue free water and organically bound tritium are estimated as a combination of HTO content in soil moisture and atmospheric humidity. HTO contamination of aquifer is modeled using available finite-differences codes within 12 hydro-geological strata.

Column experiments using sandy soil and deuterated water (D2O) were performed and a scenario of HTO transport from contaminated aquifer to atmosphere through an unsaturated soil zone was investigated. The results obtained by both model calculations and column experiments indicated that hydraulic conductivity of soil is an important soil parameter characterizing D2O transport speed and that dispersion and advection are dominant elemental transport processes in unsaturated soil.

The site of the scavenging experiments was around a 30 m emission source. The sampling arcs were chosen at 150-300 m from the base of the source to minimize dry deposition on the precipitation collectors. To study dependence of scavenging of tritium on raindrops characteristics, an optical device was constructed and used to measure the distribution of the drop radii and velocities during the period of experiment. The washout model, used for assessments, takes into account dispersion, deposition and re-emission. The model of HTO wet deposition is taken into account kinetics of HTO exchange between vapor and liquid phase with parameters such as rain drop spectra, rain intensity, condensation-evaporation on drop's interface. Gauss type formulae for permanent emission source is used to calculate HTO atmospheric concentration. Meteorological data are used as input parameters for modeling.

The objective of the study was to develop a laboratory technique to study the kinetics of HT deposition to soil due to its oxidation and the kinetics of HTO retention in local soils, which are used for agriculture and forestry. Kinetics of HT to HTO oxidation and deposition to soil has been studied in laboratory conditions. An experimental cell was developed to prepare a mixture of air, water vapor and tritium gas and to pump the mixture through the soil sample under study. The activity of HTO converted in the soil sample during a certain period of time was used to determine the oxidation rate. This rate varies, depending on the catalytic and/or biological activity of the soil material. Theoretical considerations have shown that the deposition rate can be expressed by the effective rate of oxidation, which formally corresponds to the first-order HT oxidation. The rate of HT to HTO conversion and deposition to soil is required for assessment of consequences of HT release into the atmosphere.

The model consists of many compartments representing tritium reservoirs in a hydrological cycle in the local hydrosphere, and reservoirs in food chains in the aquatic and terrestrial environments, Underground tritium reservoirs are defined as three aquifers in the model, although the number of aquifers might depend on the site. Our present work was focused on an application of the model to an area with nuclear facilities, Tokai-mura, Japan, where there is only one aquifer, The Shinkawa (Shin River) flows through the Muramatsu area between two nuclear facilities, and then into the Pacific Ocean. About 2000 people live in the area and some use groundwater as a convenient daily water source as well as village tap water. Samples at 16 rainwater 2 and 20 groundwater sites from the Muramatsu area (5 kill) as well as 3 groundwater sites from an inland area were taken during 1983-90, and tritium concentrations were measured. In order to investigate the scale of the drainage system of the Shinkawa basin, time series data of excess tritium in rainwater and groundwater were applied to our transfer model. As a result, the volume of the aquifer was calculated as half of the annual rainfall in the area. This is so small that the tritium concentration of the groundwater has a quick time trend response to input of tritium from rainwater. The results can be used to estimate population dose of the residents in the Muramatsu area.

J	Amano, H				Amano, H			HTO emission from contaminated surfaces and distribution in environmental media around nuclear facilities	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	NOV 12-16, 2001	TSUKUBA, JAPAN				TRITIUM	Field studies were undertaken on both a wetland, which is downgrabient from a radioactive waste storage area at Chalk River Laboratory, and a grassland near Pickering nuclear power station. The purpose for this study was to quantify HTO (tritiated water/vapor) transfer in the land surface environment The amounts of evaporation and transpiration were separately estimated, because the specific activity of tritium (HTO) is commonly different between surface and subsurface soil. Most of the water and tritium fluxes are attributed to transpiration in the season examined. Measured tritium concentrations in leaves at daytime agreed with predicted values, which are based on a simple equation. The ratios of organically bound tritium (OBT) to free water tritium ranged from 0.2 to 0.8 in this study.

A model of helium exchanges with the atmosphere has been developed. It takes into account the diffusion phenomena and the influence of atmospheric pressure changes. The validation has been achieved with a pilot and the comparison between theoretical and experimental data has highlighted a very good agreement. Drum's helium-3 leak equilibrates after six months and then equals the helium-3 production in the drum and so to the total tritium activity. The measurement technique is also described. It's based on quantitative helium trace level determinations with an adapted leak detector. After a drum's confinement period of 5 hours and a cryogenic treatment of gaseous samples, the method allows to detect a 5 GBq activity of tritium in a drum.

This paper reports the results of experiments carried out to characterize the ability of this device to measure tritium activity on smear paper, on flat surfaces and in water. The characterization of the SAM involves measuring the minimum detection limit, the linearity, and the settling time after a disturbance. Experimental evidence is presented to show that SAM is an effective tool for smear, direct surface contamination, and tritiated water measurements. In addition, preliminary results are presented to demonstrate the potential for monitoring surfaces contaminated with alpha emitters.

For this purpose, various tritium-containing graphite plates were prepared at first by ion implantation. After the tritium implantation, measurements of an X-ray spectrum from the graphite plates were carried out in the argon atmosphere. A good linear relation was observed between the intensity of Ar(Kalpha) characteristic X-rays and the total amount of tritium deter-mined by full-combustion. The apparent conversion efficiency was determined as 4.15x10(-6) counts/s/Bq. To determine the intrinsic conversion efficiency for argon atoms, relevant correction factors such as geometrical efficiency, absorption of X-rays, effects of a tritium depth profile and a photoelectric effect were experimentally evaluated through numerical calculations. Taking into account these correction factors, the intrinsic conversion efficiency was determined to be 3.1x10(-4) photons/beta-particle.

Among the analytical techniques (mass spectrometry, gas chromatography, laser Raman spectroscopy, calorimetry, ionisation chambers, etc.) available at the TLK, gas chromatography plays a special role because different gas chromatographs are used not only for basic and applied research, but also for infrastructure applications. The TLK gas chromatographs are evaluated on the basis of flow diagrams and typical chromatograms. Further details such as type of columns, detectors and detection limits are also given.

Preparation and measurement includes three steps. The first step is to pump the dissolved gas from the environmental water samples stored in special glass bulb. The second step is the storage of the degassed water for a few months. In die final step the helium-3 formed from tritium is measured by mass spectrometer. In the course of tritium measurement there were some difficulties with the glass bulbs. such as pre-treatment of the glass. storage of the samples in deep freezer, long storage time, O-ring sealing. To solve these problems metal bulbs were built and applied with volume of six litres. The metal bulb was equipped with a metal valve. Three litres of water can be filled into the metal bulb. The large volume of the bulb causes an increase of degassing time, and a decrease of the storage time, The degassing of three litres of water needs twice one and a half hours in two days. The storage time is only two months in contrast to the half-year storage time of glass bulb. The background, the helium penetration from the air is less than using glass bulbs, because the metal bulb can be fitted to the inlet system via copper gasket instead of elastic O-ring.

It was demonstrated that the tritium distribution at a microscopic area in the specimens was quantitatively and graphically displayed. In the pure vanadium specimen, the local tritium concentration was about three times different depending on the crystal orientation of the grains. The tritium radioactivity of the grains with (00 1) and (111) orientation are 1 Bq/mm(2) and 0.4 Bq/mm(2), respectively. These values correspond to the tritium concentration of 15 mol ppb and 6 mol ppb. The difference of the local tritium concentration was attributed to the variety of the morphology of precipitated hydride depending on the crystal orientation of the grains. For the radioactivity recorded in the imaging plate, the component of the X-rays generated from tritium in the specimen was only 2%, i.e., most of the intensity was attributed to the beta-rays. In the V-Fe alloy specimen, it was shown that the tritium distribution correlates with iron segregation formed during solidification after the arc melting. The cross sectional observation showed that the local tritium concentration in equilibrium distribution depends on the local iron concentration in the specimen. The local tritium concentration gradually decreases from 115 mol ppb to 70 mol ppb as the iron concentration at the iron segregated region increases from 3 mol% to 4.5 mol%.

J	Klein, JE				Klein, JE			A summary of tritium in-bed accountability for 1500 liter LaNi4.25Al0.75 storage beds	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	NOV 12-16, 2001	TSUKUBA, JAPAN					In-bed accountability (IBA), a steady-state, flowing gas calorimetric method, has been implemented for production measurement of tritium inventories in metal hydride storage beds utilizing a LaNi4.25Al0.25 metal hydride alloy. Six-point calibration curves have been completed for six, nominal 390 gram, and two nominal 1310 gram tritium metal hydride storage beds. The equations used to calculate inventory errors are derived and presented in the Appendix. Beds with the same amount of insulation gave similar IBA calibration curves and bed temperature versus tritium inventory results. Tritium IBA inventory measurement errors varied slightly with bed inventory and maximum values at the 95% confidence level ranged from 4 to 9 grams for the 390 gram beds (1.1 to 2.6%) and from 8 to 13 grams for the 1310 gram beds (0.7 to 1.2%). Comparison of other methods for determining inventories on the same beds (hydride pressure, hydride bed temperature, and hydride bed temperature rise above the glove box temperature) showed the IBA method gave the highest accuracy tritium measurements. These other inventory methods also showed greater variability in measurement error over the range of tritium inventories. van't Hoff plots of hydride bed pressure under steady-state IBA conditions revealed a reduction in hydride pressure after several months of tritium service compared to other beds without tritium exposure.

This method expands upon a previous tritium imaging concept, also developed at PPPL.(1) Enhancements include an objective lens coupled to the entry aperture of a coherent fiber optic (CFO) bundle, and a relay lens connecting the exit aperture of the fiber bundle to an intensifier tube and a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera.(2) The system has been specifically fabricated for use in determining tritium concentrations on first wall materials. One potential complication associated with the development of D-T fueled fusion reactors is the deposition of tritium (i.e. co-deposited layer) on the surface of the primary wall of the vacuum vessel.(3) It would be advantageous to implement a process to accurately determine tritium distribution on these inner surfaces. This fiber optic imaging device provides a highly practical method for determining the location, concentration, and activity of surface tritium deposition. In addition, it can be employed for detection of tritium "hot-spots" and "hide-out" regions present on the surfaces being imaged.

Initial estimates of the period of time that the AGHS would be needed to detritiate the machine exhaust gases was of the order of a year. However tritium emanation from the machine and the in vessel inventory has meant that the AGHS has operated continuously since this time. It has therefore been necessary to continue operations whilst also carrying out plant development and maintenance.

The construction of the building and the safety systems was completed until 1985. The operations of the safety systems with tritium have been started from March 1988. The amount of tritium held at the TPL was 19.1 PBq at March 2001. The average tritium concentration in a stream from a stack of the TPL to environment was 2.3x10(-5)Bq/cm(3); and is 1/200 smaller than that of the regulation value for the concentration of HTO in the air. A record for the safety operation of tritium has thus been accumulated. The failure data of several main components of the TPL was also obtained giving valuable data of the tritium operation experience.

The tritium retention in the vacuum system is one important contribution to the overall tritium inventory. The high vacuum system for ITER is based on a set of cryogenic pumps, and sees the whole spectrum of tritiated gas species. The cryopumps are accumulation pumps; thus, the semi-permanent tritium inventory present in them is governed by the effectiveness of pump regeneration. Moreover, a permanent inventory background must also be envisaged. This paper delineates the staggered pump concept and a multi-stage regeneration scheme as main measures for step-wise minimisation of the tritium inventory in the high vacuum pump system and outlines the different contributions which add to it. By these methods, the 268 g of tritium inventory present after nominal long pulse operation of ITER, depending on the chosen fuelling case, can be reduced to 6 g in the pumps themselves, plus up to 100 g of codeposited tritium needing recovery clean-up.

This may involve on-site work and/or work in a number of support facilities either by remote handling or manual means. This paper gives a brief in-sight concerning these arrangements and the techniques used to control and contain tritium in it's various forms. Details of enclosures, their ventilation, decontamination techniques and operational experiences from three major engineering shutdowns are discussed in detail.

Though tritium concentration of drain water is below the limit of regulations of the local agreement and the law, small tritium contamination in the facility drain and in the rain drain of stack appeared occasionally. For a scheduled maintenance work of the in-vessel components, following an annual deuterium plasma discharge campaign, a 4-week no-deuterium (H or He) plasma discharge campaign and the succeeded ventilation by room air allow to reduce tritium on the interior surface of in-vessel components. This cleaning up shots and air introduction allowed workers to enter into the vacuum vessel. Air blow well tends to remove surface tritium elements and would be necessary before disassembly and replacement of components on vacuum pumping lines.
