The system consists of a high intensity proton beam accelerator, spallation target, and sub-critical reactor core. The liquid lead-bismuth, Pb-Bi, as spallation target, was put in the center of the core region. The general approach was conducted throughout the nitride fuel that allows the utilities to choose the strategy for destroying or minimizing the most dangerous high level wastes in a fast neutron spectrum. The fuel introduced surrounding the target region was the same with the composition of MOX from 33 GWd/t PWRs spent-fuel with 5 year cooling and has been compared with the fuel composition from 45 and 60 GWd/t PWRs spent-fuel with the same cooling time. The basic characteristics of the system such as burn-up reactivity swing, power density, neutron fluxes distribution, and nuclides densities were obtained from the results of the neutronics and burn-up analyses using ATRAS computer code of the Japan Atomic Energy research Institute, JAERI.

J	Yapici, H				Yapici, H			Temperature distribution in mixed ThO2-UO2 fuel rods located in blanket of an inertial fusion energy breeder	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							DRIVEN HYBRID REACTOR; NUCLEAR-WEAPON PROLIFERATION; LIGHT-WATER REACTOR; CANDU SPENT FUEL; NEUTRONIC PERFORMANCE; FISSILE FUEL; MODERATED D; OXIDE FUEL; THORIUM; REJUVENATION	Investigations of neutronic analysis and temperature distribution in fuel rods located in a blanket driven ICF (Inertial Confinement Fusion) have been performed for various mixed fuels and coolants under a first wall load of 5 MW/m(2). The fuel rods containing ThO2 and UO2 mixed by various mixing methods for achieving a flat fission power density are replaced in the blanket and cooled with different coolants; natural lithium, flibe, eutectic lithium and helium for the nuclear heat transfer. It is assumed that surface temperature of the fuel rod increases linearly from 500 degreesC (at top) to 700 degreesC (at bottom) during cooling fuel zone. Neutronic and temperature distribution calculations have been performed by MCNP4B Code and HEATING7, respectively. In the blanket fueled with pure UO2 and cooled with helium, M (fusion energy multiplication ratio) increases to similar to3.9 due to uranium having higher fission cross-section than thorium. The high fission energy released in this blanket, therefore, causes proportionally increasing of temperature in the fuel rods to 823 degreesC. However, the M is similar to2.00 in the blanket fueled with pure ThO2 and cooled with eutectic lithium because of more capture reaction than fission reaction. Maximum and minumum values of TBR (tritium breeding ratio) being one of main neutronic paremeters for a fusion reactor are similar to1.07 and similar to1.45 in the helium and the natural lithium coolant blanket, respectively. These consequences bring out that the investigated reactor can produce substantial electricity in situ during breeding fissile fuel and can be self-sufficient in the tritium required for the DT fusion driver in all cases of mixed fuels and coolant types, Quasi-constant fission power density profiles in FFB (fissile fuel breeding) zone are obtained by parabolically increasing mixture fraction of UO2 in radial and axial directions for all coolant types. Such as, in the helium coolant blanket and the case of PMF (parabolically mixed fuel), Gamma (peek-to-average fission power density ratio) of the blanket is reduced to similar to1.1, and the maximum temperatures of the fuel rods in radial direction of the FFB zone are also quasi-constant. At the same time, in the case of PMF for a I I coolant types, the temperature profiles in the radial direction of the fuel rods rise proportionally with surface temperature from the top to the bottom of fuel rods in the axial direction. In other words, for each radial temperature profile in the axial direction, temperature difference between centerline and surface of the fuel rods are quasi-constant. According to the coolant types, these temperature diffences vary between 30 and 45 degreesC. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The dependence of the full-energy peak efficiency on the sample density was obtained for some particular photon energies and, as a result, the corresponding self-attenuation correction factors were obtained. The calculations were performed by assuming that natural materials have mass attenuation coefficients very similar to those of water in the energy range studied. Three different HpGe coaxial detectors were considered: an n-type detector with 44.3% relative efficiency and two p-type detectors of relative efficiencies 20.0% and 30.5%. Our calculations were in very good agreement with the self-attenuation correction factors obtained experimentally by other workers for environmental samples of different densities. This work demonstrates the reliability of Monte Carlo calculations for correcting photon self-attenuation in natural samples. The results also show that the corresponding correction factors are essentially unaffected by the specific coaxial detector used. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

With time resolutions of about 1-3 d correlations between these Be-7-related properties and different meteorological parameters were identified. We found that AMAD is anti-correlated to Be-7 counts. It is correlated with the relative humidity (RH) and mean cloud cover with high confidence, but not with temperature. We also found that Be-7 radioactivity was correlated with the RH with a moderate confidence, but not with the mean cloud cover or temperature. Furthermore, wet precipitation present in the middle of the sampling period decreased the Be-7 activity and increased the AMAD, while wet precipitation before or at the beginning of the sampling period decreased both Be-7 activity and AMAD. Finally, after a cold front passed by, the AMAD decreased and the Be-7 activity increased. Possible explanations are also given. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Christopher, TA; Guldner, R				Christopher, TA; Guldner, R			Nuclear power in the United States of America and in Europe - a market survey from a vendor's point of view	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								A world population continuing to grow must be provided with sufficient energy supplies at acceptable prices and so as to affect the environment and the climate as little as possible. A growing energy requirement can be met sustainably by a diversified energy mix. Globally, there is a reassessment of nuclear power. Under aspects of the economy, protection of the environment and the climate, geological availability, and geopolitics, nuclear power will make valuable contributions to a solution. In the United States, the use of nuclear power has become attractive again in the course of deregulation and as a result of massive increases in plant availability. The nuclear power plants currently in operation offer a promising outlook for the future, also because of the current price increases for natural gas. As a consequence of the Green Paper by the EU Commission on the continuity of supply, nuclear power is being reassessed also in Europe. As a result of deregulation of the electricity market, efforts have been made to increase the competitiveness of existing generating capacities. In accordance with changed market conditions, producers have adapted to the requirements of the market by establishing strategic partnerships. The envisaged construction of a nuclear power plant in Finland shows that also new nuclear power plants can be attractive in deregulated European markets and that, e.g., also the problems of spent fuel and waste management can be solved if the political will exists to do so. In Germany, on the other hand, the political framework conditions for nuclear power continue to be difficult. Unless Germany is willing to fall behind internationally in power generation, all available types of power generation will have to be advanced and combined into a mix serving future needs also in this country. There must be no disruption of technological know-how. Nuclear power must be an important option kept open under reasonable political boundary conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	VERLAGSGRP HANDELSBLATT GMBH	DUSSELDORF	POSTFACH 10 11 02, D-40002 DUSSELDORF, GERMANY	1431-5254			ATW-INT Z KERNENERG	ATW-Int.

The fuel produced from uranium obtained from reprocessing and enriched uranium has characteristics which offer advantages both in fabrication and economic in-pile use. The ERU fuel elements are fabricated on the basis of Framatome ANP specifications by MSZ (Mashinostroitelny Zavod), Elektrostal, Russia. Cooperation of the two firms began in 1994. Meanwhile, 400 fuel elements have been fabricated by MSZ. They are used successfully in pressurized water and boiling water reactors and show optimum operating characteristics. Another step realized is the production of UO2/Gd2O3 fuel and fuel rods at MSZ. The necessary manufacturing technology was developed and qualified jointly; the rich background of experience of Framatome ANP GmbH in UO2/Gd2O3 technology was used for this purpose. The process line at MSZ has a manufacturing capacity of 10 t/a and represents another technically workable solution to the economic utilization of recycled uranium.

J	[Anonymous]				[Anonymous]			60-years controlled nuclear fission: CP-1	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								On December 2, 1942, the Chicago Pile 1 (CP-1) went critical for the first time. In this way, the scientists and engineers involved in the project under the leadership of Enrico Fermi succeeded in demonstrating that a self-sustaining nuclear reaction with nuclear fission processes was technically feasible. Only four years after the discovery and proof of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn, Fritz Strayssmann, and Lise Meitner, the experiment consisting of graphite blocks as the moderator and uranium dioxide pellets as the fuel, as well as instrumentation and control devices, had been set up in the former squash court of the field and track stadium of the University of Chicago. Precisely at 3.36 a.m. Chicago time, after control rods had been withdrawn, the instruments showed the chain reaction by the neutron flux they indicated. An important cornerstone in the use of nuclear power had thus been laid.									0	0	0	1	4	VERLAGSGRP HANDELSBLATT GMBH	DUSSELDORF	POSTFACH 10 11 02, D-40002 DUSSELDORF, GERMANY	1431-5254			ATW-INT Z KERNENERG	ATW-Int.

JET is thus the tokamak. best suited for studies of various nuclear technology issues that will be of importance for future DT fuelled machines. The Active Gas Handling System (AGHS) built for the supply and reprocessing of tritium is still in operation to detritiate the exhaust gases and to provide the necessary ventilation during vessel openings because > 1 g of tritium remain in the machine even 4 years after the DTE1 campaign. The tritium is bound in co-deposited layers and flakes formed mainly on the shadowed inner part of the divertor, and in the bulk of tiles. Areas of erosion and deposition are being identified and preliminary models for the material movement developed. Characterisation of the properties of tiles and flakes is very important to develop the best handling techniques. Due to the activation of the machine and the use of Be and T entry to the torus is limited by the need to minimise worker doses and is currently only possible in full pressurised. suite. Work inside it is, therefore, performed with remote handling tools where practicable, e.g. the removal of the divertor septum and the collection of dust and flakes from areas below the divertor to achieve a more accurate tritium balance. Techniques need to be developed to reduce the tritium content in waste to permit disposal as low level waste ( < 12 kBq/g) and to recover tritium for re-use. Validation of activation models, understanding of the risks due to inhalation of tritiated particles and the local environmental impact of tritium are further important aspects. The paper presents various nuclear issues studied at JET due to activation and tritium. Crown Copyright (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The ST power plant operates at a low aspect ratio of typically 1.4-1.6, which allows operation at high beta. This offers stability at high elongation which permits operation at high bootstrap current fraction ( > 95%), leaving only a modest external current drive requirement. This high elongation also results in a relatively uniform neutron wall loading giving the first wall components a longer life before replacement is required. The ST can be readily maintained on a timescale commensurate with this material life since its simple and robust centre column can be easily removed by lowering it into a hot cell beneath the load assembly and replaced with a new or reconditioned one. This is possible because it does not require inboard breeder blankets to maintain its tritium economy, or a substantial inboard shield since the centre column consists of a water-cooled copper centre rod surrounded by a relatively thin steel neutron shield. The plasma is operated in a double null configuration, forming both an upper and lower divertor. In order to accommodate the high erosion rates and heat fluxes developed in the divertors a novel system based on the use of a cascading flow of silicon carbide pebbles has been evaluated. The layout of the main elements of the power plant has been developed with revised power flows giving the steam cycle a thermal efficiency of about 43%.

The present design concept is based on nuclear, processing and fusion technologies that either exist or are at an advanced stage of development and on the existing tokamak plasma physics database. A FTWR, operating with k(eff) less than or equal to 0.95 at a thermal power output of about 3 GW and with a fusion neutron source operating at Q(p) = 1.5-2, could fission the transuranic content of about a hundred metric tons of spent nuclear fuel per full-power-year and would be self-sufficient in both electricity and tritium production. In equilibrium, a nuclear fleet consisting of Light Water Reactors (LWRs) and FTWRs in the electrical power ratio of 3/1 would reduce the actinides discharged from the LWRs in a once-through fuel cycle by 99.4% in the waste stream that must be stored in high-level waste repositories.

In this study a principal design of FPR blanket was examined for transmutation of long-life minor actinides (Np, Am, Cm). A production of minor actinide isotopes is equal to 20-30 kg/l GW(e) year for now operating fission reactors, and their amounts will rise with the expected growth of fission reactor power. These isotopes have long-life time and can be dangerous in big amounts in future. Plutonium isotopes are not included in an assumption that they will be used in fission reactors. The major goals of the study were to determine FPR blanket composition corresponding to fast transmutation rate of actinides and tritium self-supply simultaneously. Tritium breeding ratio (TBR) was obtained at level 1.11 for water cooling and reached up 1.56 in variant with helium-cooled assemblies with Np nitride. It was concluded that rows with actinides from processed waste fuel should be arranged near the plasma first wall. Advantages of helium above water cooling are observed in the twice-increased loading of waste fissionable materials and essential increase of achievable TBR. Burnout of Np, Am, Cm would remain at a level similar to40-50% after 4 full power years. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The detector consists of a well-type 22.8 x 22.8 cm(2) CSI scintillator (for photon detection) and a small plastic electron detector inserted in the well. This system has been used to measure the decay heat induced in 15 natural elements, irradiated with 14 MeV neutrons. The experimental results have been used to validate the calculation code system EASY-2001, especially developed for the prediction of induced radioactivity in fusion devices. The Calculation versus experiment (C/E) results are reported. For those results where deviations from the C/E = 1 line were found, outside the experimental uncertainty band, new effective (integral) cross-sections are proposed, able to bring the results inside the uncertainty estimations. The new cross-section values are discussed in the text. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A set of plasma parameter was decided suitable for the ST transmutation nuclear waste blanket. Using the 2-D neutron transport code TWODANT, the 3-D Monte Carlo code MCNP-4B and the 1-D burn-up calculation code BISON3.0 and their associated data libraries to calculate the transmutation rate, the energy multiplication factor and the tritium breeding ratio of the transmutation blanket. The calculation results of the system parameters and the actinide series isotopes for different operation times were also given. The engineering feasibility of the center-post of FDTR has been investigated. Relevant results were also given. A preliminary neutronics calculation based on ST transmutation blanket shows that the proposed system has a high transmutation capability for MA wastes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The concept has the attractive advantages e.g. tritium is self-sustainable, plutonium for the purpose of neutron multiplication is self-sustainable and the thermal power output is stable.

In Japan, tritium safety studies are being conducted in JAERI (Japan.Atomic Energy Research Institute), NIRS (National Institute of Radiological Sciences), and universities. In JAERI, experiments and experiences in Tritium Process Laboratory (TPL) are most important. Here, a few kilograms of tritium have been safely used from its start of operation in 1988. Recent important research subject is elucidation of tritium behavior in the tritium confinement system using a caisson (12m(5)) combined with tritium removal system. JAREI is also conducting safety related studies such as, tritium confinement, tritium decontamination, tritium permeation, off-normal events, and tritium accountancy. In universities, various fundamental researches have been conducted, including tritium permeation, simulation of tritium behavior in the fusion reactor system, tritium contamination and decontamination, tritium measurement, tritium interaction with materials, and tritium trapping on the surface of various fusion reactor components. Tritium environmental behavior and biological effect are important subjects to evaluate the consequences of released tritium and to provide an appropriate information to receive good public acceptance for fusion reactor. Fundamental and code development studies related to them are being conducted in universities, JAERI, and NIRS. Licensing preparation for ITER is being conducted at the Government in the collaboration with JAERI.

As the amount of dust increases, potential safety and operational concerns arise. The dust may contain tritium, may be radioactive from activation products, and may be chemically reactive and/or toxic. Possible accidents in large fusion reactors could mobilize the dust and threaten public safety. Dust also poses potential problems to device operation. For example, plasma startup could be impeded, particulate injected from flaking deposits may disrupt the fusion plasma, and tritium retention in dust will affect fuel recovery systems. The current understanding of dust's role in fusion devices is reviewed in this paper by discussing mechanisms of dust production, considering ways dust impacts device safety and operation, and comparing characteristics of dust collected from existing fusion plasma research devices.

Extensive probabilistic and deterministic analyses have been done to select abnormal event sequences, and to ensure that all potential consequences are within project guidelines. The paper deals with the work done for the tritium systems. A Bottom-Up methodology based on component level Failure Mode and Effect Analysis has been applied to point out accident initiators. Once possible accident sequences have been identified, detailed deterministic analyses on bounding events confirmed that the accidents in tritium plant are not a concern from a safety point of view. The no-evacuation goal of ITER-FEAT is attained also for accidents where 'ultimate safety margin' are challenged, as in case of hydrogen-air reactions in cold box or in hard shell, enclosing the process equipment of the isotope separation system.

All systems located in the tokamak building of ITER FEAT facility important from the radiological point of view are considered. Radiological source terms with an important collective dose impact are airborne tritium and activated corrosion products (ACP) in the coolant of the water cooling system (WCS). A suitable computer code is used to assess the ACP inventory in the different WCS components. The dose rate is then assessed by considering walls attenuation with the 3D transport code MCNP, a Monte Carlo code that performs gamma ray transport calculation. Working activities needed to operate, maintain and replace each component of systems under study are partly provided by system designers and partly derived from the experience developed in operating nuclear fission reactors. In conclusion the collective dose result is shown and partly compared with that of previous ITER design stages considering the different systems and solutions and pointing out ALARA improvements.

However, being a form of nuclear energy, fusion shares with fission most of its safety problems. This study concerns the assessment of both the short term and the long term hazards associated with fusion, compared with the same figures for fission reactors. Fission data derive from well-known PWR safety assessments, and in particular from the Italian project Progetto Unificato Nucleare (PUN). Fusion data derive from the latest findings of the European Safety and Environmental Assessment of Fusion Power (SEAFP) programme. Concerning inadvertent intrusion in a radioactive waste disposal site and long-term degradation for fusion, this analysis was performed in the frame of the SEAFP studies, while for fission data are taken from typical European waste disposal sites. In all relevant cases, evaluation of associated risks is carried out, with a comparison of the obtained results.

J	Reyes, S; Sanz, J; Latkowski, JF				Reyes, S; Sanz, J; Latkowski, JF			Use of clearance indexes to assess waste disposal issues for the HYLIFE-II inertial fusion energy power plant design	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	APR 07-12, 2002	SAN DIEGO, CA			inertial fusion energy; safety; environment		Traditionally, waste management studies for fusion energy have used the waste disposal rating (WDR) to evaluate if radioactive material from irradiated structures could qualify for shallow land burial. However, given the space limitations and the negative public perception of large volumes of waste, there is a growing international motivation to develop a fusion waste management system that maximizes the amount of material that can be cleared or recycled. In this work, we present an updated assessment of the waste management options for the HYLIFE-II inertial fusion energy (IFE) power plant, using the concept of clearance index (0) for radioactive waste disposal. With that purpose, we have performed a detailed neutronics analysis of the HYLIFE-II design, using the TART and ACAB computer codes for neutron transport and activation, respectively. Whereas the traditional version Of ACAB only provided the user with the gamma contact dose rate for recycling assessments and WDR as an index for waste disposal considerations, here we have modified the code to calculate CIs using the current international atomic energy agency (IAEA) clearance limits for radiological waste disposal. The results from the analysis are used to perform an assessment of the waste management options for the HYLIFE-II IFE design. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Youssef, MZ; Sawan, ME				Youssef, MZ; Sawan, ME			Radwaste volume in lithium and Flibe thick liquid wall and comparison to conventional SW concepts	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	APR 07-12, 2002	SAN DIEGO, CA			radwaste volume; thick liquid wall; SW concepts; high power density concepts	HEAT DEPOSITION; DESIGN; FW	Among the advantages offered by the deployment of thick liquid walls (LW) in high power density reactors is the substantial reduction in radwaste volume and hazard that is mainly attributed to the extended lifetime of structural materials. In this paper, we quantitatively estimate the volume of the generated waste when different thick LWs are used. In particular, we make a comparison of the radwaste volume between lithium and Flibe as potential candidates for deployment as the thick LWs in high power density reactors (10 MW/m(2)). In addition, the volume of the generated waste is compared with the corresponding volume in two conventional solid wall (SW) blankets with low wall load (LWL, 5 MW/m(2)) and high wall load (HWL, 10 MW/m(2)). In this assessment exercise, the blankets under consideration were optimized first such that adequate tritium breeding ratio (TBR) is obtained and the same level of magnet protection against radiation damage is reached. This initial optimization step was necessary to arrive at consistent comparisons. It is shown that using LWL conventional SW blanket generates similar to10% more waste volume per unit height than that generated with the lithium LW concept while similar to 35% more waste volume is generated if the HWL conventional SW blanket is deployed. On the other hand, it is shown that the thick Li LW option generates total waste whose volume is a factor of similar to 1.3 larger than the one with the thick Flibe option which has superior neutron moderating capabilities compared with lithium.

In order to simulate the circumstances, several sheets of foil with a thickness of 50-250 mum were laminated on a polyethylene board for six fusion materials (Fe, Cu, V, Ti, W, Pb). The laminated samples were irradiated with intense D-T neutrons at the fusion neutronics source facility in JAERI. After irradiation, the decay gamma rays emitted from the sequential reaction products ((56)Co, (65)Zn, (51)Cr, (48)V, (184)Re, (206)Bi) were measured and the effective cross-sections for producing those were obtained at several positions. The present results indicated that the sequential reaction rate increases prominently as the location becomes closer to hydrogen compounds. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A central part of EASY is the European activation file library of 12470 neutron-induced cross sections. A major effort to increase the accuracy and confidence in this library has been carried out by a process of validation with integral measurements. Experiments have been carried. out in three complementary neutron spectra by irradiating a series of fusion relevant materials. These irradiations can then be modelled by EASY, and the comparison between the calculated (C) and experimental (E) activity values enable C/E ratios to be found for the production of a set of radionuclides. Examples of reactions that can be validated and of discrepant C/E values and the resulting data improvements are given. These studies demonstrate the high level of validation that gives EASY-2001 its status as a first-class activation code and data package. (C) 2002 UKAEA. Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Electrical power has many uses in both magnetic and inertial fusion experiments; it is the most important support system for any fusion experiment. Electricity powers a wide variety of plant equipment, including vacuum pumps, magnets, coolant pumps, air handlers, compressors, and either plasma heating or target implosion drivers. Electricity also powers instrumentation and controls, control and data acquisition computers, accident mitigation systems and site security systems. Most facilities use electrical power to ensure adequate confinement of radioactive materials via air pressure zone control, valve isolation, and operation of cleanup systems. As a result, operating experiences of electrical switchgear, cabling, motor control centers, and electrical panels have been examined for reliability, maintenance times, accident case histories, accident initiating event frequencies, and personnel safety issues, Electrical component failure rates and repair times, and initiating event frequencies are presented in this paper.

J	Anderson, MH; Corradini, ML; Bonazza, R				Anderson, MH; Corradini, ML; Bonazza, R			Measurements of vapor flow regimes in liquid metal pools	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	APR 07-12, 2002	SAN DIEGO, CA			MHD; liquid metal; flow regimes	SYSTEM	There is significant ongoing research within the APEX project to develop innovative first wall/blanket concepts capable of efficiently extracting useful thermal energy from magnetic fusion devices that can substantially improve the attractiveness of fusion energy systems. Among the several different ideas are solid and liquid wall concepts. One solid wall concept being considered is the EVOLVE concept. This concept relies on liquid lithium filled tungsten trays to act as a heat transfer and tritium breeding media. In this design, liquid lithium flows into tungsten trays and is brought to the saturation temperature by volumetric neutronic heating of the liquid lithium and tungsten trays. The lithium vapor generated could then be used as the heat transfer media for the thermal power cycle. Key to this design is the vaporization and boiling of the lithium in the presence of a strong magnetic fields ( similar to 7 T). Initial analysis of the boiling phenomena lead to many questions regarding the void fractions and boiling flow regime (void distribution) that may exist in the trays [Fusion Technol. 39 (2001) 8 10]. Since it is necessary to know the void fraction and flow regime present during the boiling process to determine the neutronic heating and energy removal capability, experiments have been initiated to examine this issue. This paper presents initial experiments and scaling analysis conducted in a new test section, which provides real time X-ray determination of flow regimes and void fractions within a pool of low-density liquid metal (NaK) during gas injection inside a horizontal magnetic field. Data will be presented from a first series of tests with gas injection of volumetric flow rates from 0 to 5 SCFH (0 < J(g) < 0.06 m/s) with no field. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The problem of preparing the gamma-ray sources in cells of 3D geometry was solved by creation of an interface between the MCNP and FISPACT programs. The interface allows optimizing the process of activation analysis by revealing dominant sources of radiation. The developed interface essentially reduces the time needed for calculations. The main advantage of the method is realization of so-called 'multibox' procedure for decay gamma source sampling during decay gamma transport in very large and complex fusion reactor models. Shutdown dose rate calculations are faster (up to 600 times in ITER cryostat) in comparison with applied MCNP standard source definition by using an external user-supplied source subroutine of the 'multibox' procedure. The offered method is intended for solution of the activation tasks with deep penetration of radiation. The method was used in the engineering design of ITER-FEAT and RF DEMO-S.

The design of the following equipment has been adapted for the smaller machine with reduced access space for the RH equipment: the RH equipment used for the in-vessel RH operations to be deployed from the casks, the RH equipment that is used to remove the in-port assemblies (port plugs), as well as the remotely operated casks, which, with the use of double-door systems, can be attached to and removed from vacuum vessel ports. Defective components are loaded in transfer casks and moved by means of a remotely operated air floatation system attached underneath the cask, to the hot cell facility, where they dock against identical port interfaces and unload the component for remote refurbishment and/or waste storage.

In the case of a fast ignition inertial fusion system, advanced targets have been proposed that may be self-sufficient in terms of tritium breeding (i.e. the amount of tritium bred in target exceeds the amount burned). This aspect allows for greater freedom when selecting a liquid for the protective blanket, given that lithium-bearing compounds are no longer required. Materials selection may now be based upon other characteristics, such as safety and environmental (S&E), pumping power, corrosion, and vapor pressure, along with others. The present work assesses the characteristics of many single, binary, and ternary molten-salts and liquid metals using the NIST Properties of Molten Salts Database. As an initial screening, liquids were evaluated for their S&E characteristics, which included an assessment of waste disposal rating (WDR), contact dose, and radioactive afterheat. Liquids that passed the S&E criteria were then evaluated for required pumping power. The pumping power was calculated using three components: velocity head losses, frictional losses, and lifting power. The results of the assessment are used to identify those materials that are suitable for potential liquid-chamber fast-ignition IFE concepts, from both the S&E and pumping power perspective. Recommendations for further analysis are also made. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Multivariate analysis methods adapted for interactive effects allow such assessments. We have used a multivariate analysis approach to investigate the pair-wise interactions of the previously identified three main etiological factors for lung cancer induction in Russian workers of the Mayak Production Association (PA) nuclear enterprise. These three factors are as follows: (1) body burden of inhaled plutonium-239 (Pu-239), an influence on absorbed alpha-radiation dose; (2) cumulative, absorbed external gamma-radiation dose to the lung; and (3) level of cigarette smoking as indicated by a smoking index (SI). The SI represents the cigarettes smoked per day times years smoking. The Mayak PA workers were exposed by inhalation to both soluble and insoluble forms of Pu-239. Based on a cohort of 4,390 persons (77% male), we conducted a nested, case-control study of lung cancer induction using 486 matched cases and controls. Each case was matched to two controls. Matching was based on five factors: sex, year of birth, year work began, profession, and workplace. Three levels of smoking were considered: low (SI = 1 to 499), used as a reference level; middle (SI = 500 to 900); and high (SI = 901 to 2,000). For lung cancer induction, a supra-multiplicative effect was demonstrated for high external gamma-ray doses (> 2.0 Gy) plus high Pu-239 intakes (body burden >2.3 kBq). This observation is consistent with the hypothesis of curvilinear dose-response relationships for lung cancer induction by high- and low-LET radiations. The interaction between radiation (external gamma rays or Pu-239 body burden) and cigarette smoke was found to depend on the smoking level. For the middle level of smoking in combination with gamma radiation (> 2.0 Gy) or Pu-239 body burden (> 2.3 kBq), results were consistent with additive effects. However, for the high level of smoking in combination with gamma radiation (> 2.0 Gy) or Pu-239 body burden (> 2.3 kBq), results were consistent with the occurrence of multiplicative effects. These results indicate that low-dose risk estimates for radiation-induced lung cancer derived without adjusting for the influence of cigarette smoking could be greatly overestimated. Further, such systematic error may considerably distort the shape of the risk vs. dose curve and could possibly obscure the presence of a dose threshold for radiation-induced lung cancer.

Initial particle size distribution included the respirable range, with most of the particles between 0.5 to 5.0 mum. Tracers were released in a nuclear laboratory/work environment and were collected via passive collector foils to obtain the spatial distribution of deposition. The observed distribution characteristics did not always correspond to the measured air flow patterns, and they showed a non-negligible dependence on aerosol dynamics such as thermophoretic effects. The collected data represent integrated deposition flux, which can serve for validation of aerosol dynamics models that aim to predict the deposition fluence of particles and may also be used for planning surface contamination surveys following accidental releases.

It is important to understand how this dust loading affects the response of the continuous air monitors. Not only must a filter be changed if there is a reduction in airflow, but a change may be necessary if the energy resolution deteriorates and the continuous air monitor loses sensitivity and specificity for the radioactive aerosols of interest. A series of experiments were conducted to investigate alpha-particle energy resolution of continuous air monitor filters, particularly under dust loading conditions. Aerosol particles of various sizes were tagged with radon decay products to serve as surrogates for radioactive aerosols of interest such as plutonium or uranium. While the size of radioactive aerosols, filter type, and dust type affected the energy resolution, the thickness of an underlying (nonradioactive) dust layer did not show significant effect for the materials studied and a loading range of 0.01-10 mg cm(-2). Our results indicate that it is possible for continuous air monitors to detect the release of radioactive aerosols with little deterioration in energy resolution under conditions of significant dust loading provided that the deposited layer of radioactive aerosols remains thin (less than or equal to 0.1 mg cm(-2)).

For approximately 1 y an 8-stage cascade impactor was co-located with a high volume sampler and operated at the Fernald Environmental Management Project site to collect aerosol samples. During most of the year, the site was dominated by giant particles with more than 70% of the mass of U-238 above 15 mum. The seasonal average of the activity median aerodynamic diameter, based on the impactor samples, which excluded particles >15 mum, for both uranium and thorium was similar to6.5 mum. These numbers reflect the activities at the site and the domination of the resuspension processes. During most sampling periods the size distribution was bimodal. Thorium concentrations were comparable to the uranium concentrations during the late spring and summer period and decreased to similar to25% of the U-238 concentration in the late summer. Fernald Environmental Management Project is required to calculate the maximum allowable dose from airborne emissions, excluding radon, to meet NESHAP compliance. These calculations assume an AMAD of 1 mum. We found that if you combine size distribution information with the latest ICRP 66 lung model you reduce the estimated dose by a factor of 7. Inclusion of the size distribution of radionuclides at any sampling site would substantially improve the dose estimates to the population.

We propose to get rid of the digital data transmission limitations in highly radioactive environments by implementing an analog. fiber-optic link based on directly modulated vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSELs). In this paper, we introduce an architecture for highly radiation-tolerant instrumentation data links based on the intrinsic wavelength division multiplexing capabilities of fiber-optic data transmission. The potential radiation acceptance level of the analog fiber-optic link is estimated on the basis of irradiation results on individual COTS photonic components such as VCSELs, fiber-optic passive multiplexers, and optical fibers.

J	Haberschill, P; Gay, L; Aubouin, P; Lallemand, M				Haberschill, P; Gay, L; Aubouin, P; Lallemand, M			Performance prediction of a refrigerating machine using R-407C: the effect of the circulating composition on system performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH			English	Article						circulating composition; zeotropic mixture; R-407C; model		This article presents a steady-state model of a vapour compression refrigerating machine using a ternary refrigerant mixture R-407C. When using a zeotropic mixture in a refrigerant cycle, the circulating composition does not agree with the composition of the original charged mixture. It is mainly due to the temperature glide and the vapour-liquid slip ratio. As a result of the composition shift and its magnitude, the system performance changes depending on the system design, especially the presence of liquid receiving vessels. In this paper, a method that predicts the circulating composition has been associated to a refrigerating machine model. The results obtained with this model show an enrichment in the most volatile components of about 1% for the circulating composition, which is sufficient to decrease the system performance by about 3%. Factors affecting the overall performance have been investigated. The results show a very strong performance dependence on the refrigerant charge. The COP can decrease by 25% when the refrigerant charge is insufficient. An initial charged composition variation of 2% involves variations of the cooling capacity of about 5%. Furthermore, our model was employed to compare the performance for both R-22 and R-407C. The cooling capacity for R-22 is slightly greater in comparison to R-407C and the COP is almost constant.

J	Radford, IR				Radford, IR			Response of mammalian cell lines that undergo necrosis after ionizing irradiation to DNA-incorporated tritium and iodine-125 decays: implications for models of radiation action	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION BIOLOGY			English	Article							DOUBLE-STRAND BREAKS; HUMAN-TUMOR-CELLS; INVERSION GEL-ELECTROPHORESIS; REPAIR FIDELITY; LOW-LET; I-125 DECAYS; V79 CELLS; X-RAYS; RADIOSENSITIVITY; DAMAGE	Purpose: To test the validity of enzymatic DNA repaire-based models of ionizing radiation-induced mammalian cell killing. Materials and methods: Sensitivity to ionizing radiation-induced killing was determined by clonogenic survival assay. Results: A panel of seven cell lines that have apparently normal enzymatic DNA repair capability and die predominantly by necrosis were shown to have marked differences in their sensitivity to killing by gamma- or X-irradiation. Despite such differences, the pseudo-diploid cell lines CHO, V79, and Vero (when corrected for differences in cell cycle distribution) and normal mouse embryo fibroblasts all had comparable D-o values for killing by DNA-incorporated I-125 that were in the range of 57-66 decays: whilst the near-tetraploid or -triploid B16-F1, RUC-2 and SQ-20B cell lines had D-o values of around 130 I-125 decays. The sensitivity of these cell lines to killing by DNA-incorporated H-3 decays was similarly related to ploidy. Conclusions: Differences in sensitivity to killing by DNA-incorporated H-3 or I-125 decays between the cell lines tested were primarily related to differences in ploidy and, second, to differences to cell cycle distribution or nuclear volume. The data do not support suggestions that generalized variability in an hypothetical aspect of enzymatic DNA repair can explain differences in sensitivity to killing by external-beam, low-linear energy transfer ionizing radiation.

Materials and methods: Different proportions of neutron irradiation were produced from the reactor SILENE using a fissile solution of uranium nitrate (8, 47 and 87% neutron). Water and electrolyte fluxes were measured in the rat in vivo under anaesthesia by insertion into the descending colon of an agarose gel cylinder simulating the faeces. Functional studies were completed by histological analyses. In the first set of experiments, rats received 3.8 Gy with various neutron percentages and were studied from 1 to 14 days after exposure. In the second set of experiments, rats were exposed to increasing doses of irradiation (1 4 Gy) with a high neutron percentage (87%n) and were studied at 4 days after exposure. Results and conclusions: The absorptive capacity of rat colon was diminished by irradiation at 3 5 days, with a nadir at 4 days. The results demonstrate that an increase in the neutron proportion is associated with an amplification of the effects. Furthermore, a delay in the re-establishment of normal absorption was observed with the high neutron proportion (87%n). A dose-dependent reduction of water absorption by rat colon was also observed following neutron irradiation (87%n), with a 50% reductio n at 3 Gy. Comparison of this dose effect curve with the curve obtained following gamma Co-60-irradiation indicates an RBE of 2.2 for absorptive colonic function in rat calculated at 4 days after exposure.

D(beta) and D(gamma) intensities were observed during discharges. As a result, the intensities from the Ta surface were less than those from the W surface. This is attributed to the release ratio of molecules and atoms from the surface, i.e. less atomic release and more molecular release from Ta. Concerning long term D retention in Ta, D distributed uniformly over the limiter and the content was about 4 x 10(-5) D per Ta atom. The total amount in the Ta limiter was estimated 3 x 10(20) D in the half limiter. After exposure, the Ta bulk showed a significantly modified surface: grain growth, wrinkle like deformations and local recrystallization. However, open cracks were not observed in Ta exposed in the same condition in which W created big open crack. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Therefore, carbon fiber composites (CFCs) with high thermal conductivity are favorable. In the framework of the European Fusion Technology program, a great effort has been made to develop Si doped CFCs. NS31 is a 3D CFC containing about 8-10 at.% of silicon. The previous results showed, that NS31 poses lower chemical erosion, lower tritium retention and higher resistivity to water/oxygen reaction in comparing with undoped CFCs. Off-normal simulation experiments were performed under two conditions: (a) 700 MW/m(2), 10 ms and (b) slow transient 20 MW/m2, 2 and 4 s. NS31 behaved very stable even under these extremely severe conditions. In this paper. the detailed results of simulation experiment on high heat loading due to off-normal events are presented and consequences are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The results for fuel distribution and content in sole tungsten and composites (vacuum plasma sprayed tungsten layer on graphite and a B(4)C coating on copper) are reported and compared with earlier obtained results for sole tungsten and graphite. In sole tungsten the deuterium content is below 1 x 10(15) cm(-2), whereas in case of the composite targets the inventory found in the hottest parts of the limiters is one at least order of magnitude greater. The fuel content on composites is predominantly related to the co-deposition process with carbon and boron. The influence of material damage (melting, detachment of a coating) and material mixing processes on the fuel retention is also addressed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Surface modification and deuterium retention after the exposure have been investigated to prove the suitability of such materials in fusion devices. Blisters are formed on the PM-W by deuterium irradiation with a fluence of 7.5 x 10(25) m(-2). The amount of blisters and their average size increase with an increase of a fluence to 3.00 x 10(26) m(-2). On the other hand, no modification is observed on VPS-W/CX-2002U. Desorption of VPS-W/CX-2002U irradiated by deuterium is different from that of PM-W. The peak temperature of D, and HD release from PM-W is about 703 K. However, the desorption curve of VPS-W/CX-2002U gradually increases with increasing temperature up to 1273 K. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Pre-irradiation with He ions caused remarkable effects on the trapping of injected deuterium. Most of the injected deuterium is desorbed between 400 and 600 K for the case without helium pre-irradiation, while additional desorption occurs between 600 and 800 K for the helium pre-irradiation case. Total amount of the trapped deuterium for irradiations of 2.0 x 10(21) He/m(2) and 1.0 x 10(22) D-2/m(2) is 6.2 x 10(20) D-2/m(2), which is more than three times higher than that in the case of no helium pre-irradiation. The present result indicates that irradiation effects of He bombardment must be taken into account to understand and evaluate the behavior of hydrogen isotopes in fusion environment.
