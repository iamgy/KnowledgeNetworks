In addition to the O- and Zr3+ paramagnetic centers already observed after X-ray irradiation at g = 1.98 and g = 1.89, we bring clear evidence of an unknown paramagnetic center at g = 1.96 induced by charged particles. For the O- center. a maximum of the integrated spin intensity occurs near 50 K, suggesting some antiferromagnetic spin-pairing effect. Respective contributions of the ionization and atomic displacement processes in defect production are addressed. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

UO2 fuel disks were irradiated at four thermal conditions, between 400 and 1300 degreesC, and at four different burn-ups, between 36 and 96 MWd/kgU, without external mechanical constraint. The microstructural evolutions as a function of the irradiation parameters are observed by high resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The SEM observations reveal the transition from original to sub-divided grains of rim structure and make clear that the burn-up threshold is between 55 and 82 MWd/kgU. The temperature threshold of this restructuring Could be 1100 +/- 100 degreesC. Moreover, polyhedral subdivided-grains with size ranging between 0.5 and 2 mum, not only rounded grains in the size range 150-350 nm, are clearly observed. These configurations are explained by assuming that the grain sub-divisions occurred homogeneously within the original polyhedral grains, while the existence of rounded grains might be due to free surface effects. TEM observations of re-structured samples show that most of sub-grain boundaries are low angle and are heavily decorated by fission gas bubbles in the range 3.5-8 nm. In the non-restructured samples. dislocations and small precipitates are present, and many of the bubbles form "strings" along dislocation lines. In specimens irradiated at high temperature. many dislocations seem to be anchored by fission product precipitates. These results suggest that the formation mechanism of the restructuring is based on polygonization, and the precipitates could have some "pinning effect" on dislocations and defect clusters.

The depth distribution of K atoms was evaluated by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS). The phenomenon of decrease of contact angle was found to be related to the increase of K atomic concentration in an earlier X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study [1]. TRIM-98 code [2] predicts a Gaussian-like distribution K atom in a PS matrix. To examine the unexpected appearance of K atoms near or on the PS surface, K ion implantation in PS was performed at energies of 50 and 150 keV with doses ranging from 5 x 10(15) to 5 x 10(16) ions/cm(2), and the composition in the K implanted layers of PS has been investigated by RBS. The depth distribution of K atoms showed a Gaussian distribution for a low dose and is in a good agreement with the theoretical distribution calculated by TRIM. At an intermediate dose, the K depth profile changed to a trapezoidal distribution. At a high dose, K enrichment was found at the surface and shows different phenomena according to accelerator energy between 50 and 150 keV. The mechanism of enrichment of K atoms is discussed in relation to TRIM code results, varying the parameters of density, surface binding energy and replacement energy. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this method, the density of implanted deuterons is measured by detecting the emitted protons from the deuteron fusion reaction between the incident deuterons and the implanted deuterons. A negative deuterium beam with an energy of 90 keV is used both for the implanted atoms and a probe beam to measure the implanted deuterons. The density of the implanted deuterium atoms was observed to be drastically different between the single crystal and poly-crystal in Ta. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Auger electron spectroscopy, or seeondary-ion mass spectroscopy. sputtering processes are used for depth profiling. However. ion beam bombardment changes the surface composition and the surface structure, which deteriorates the accuracy of the surface analysis and the depth resolution. We studied the preferential sputtering in some materials consisting of two components with different mass ratio by using the dynamic Monte Carlo simulation. Dose dependence of the depth profile of composition is presented. By Ar sputtering, the surface compositions of Au0.25Cu0.75,Au0.67Al0.33, and Ni-0.5 Cu-0.5 alloys changed to Au0.28Cu0.72, Au0.76Al0.24, and Ni0.67Cu0.33, respectively. These results agreed with the experimental data. In order to compare the effect of mass ratio on the preferential sputtering, B-C. Si-C. and W-C systems were investigated. In B-C system, preferential sputtering by 1 and 3 keV Ar ion was negligible. In W-C system. a significant preferential sputtering occurred. In Si-C system. carbon was enriched in the outermost Surface layer at a fluence lower than 3 x 10(16) ions/cm(2). At higher fluence. the partiality in concentration recovers because of the balance between the enrichment and the preferential sputtering. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The composition and distribution of elements in cross sections of the tapes were probed with a scanned 3 MeV proton microbeam using proton induced X-ray emission (PIXE). Distributions of the constituent elements were found to be heterogeneous on a scale of 10 mum. By combining the PIXE analysis with Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, the stoichiometry of the superconductor within the tape was measured, including oxygen from elastic scattering, revealing a departure from the desired 2223 composition. In one of the tapes, PIXE elemental maps of the Ag distribution showed diffusion of Ag into the superconductor from the enclosing jacket. Crystals of the same material, not fabricated into tapes, did not contain the contaminants and had a more ideal stoichiometry. Correlation maps between the constituent elements, deduced from the elemental maps, indicate the presence of secondary or unreacted phases. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Following 60 keV room temperature implantation of radioactive Ag-111 at a dose of 2-3 x 10(12) cm(-2), we identify around 30% of Ag on near-substitutional sites (approximate to0.45 Angstrom from ideal S-sites). Upon annealing at 200-300 degreesC, the fraction on near-S sites reaches a maximum around 60-80%. For higher annealing temperatures it decreases again and at 600 degreesC Ag starts to diffuse out of the Si samples. We estimate the activation energy for the dissociation of near-substitutional Ag to be 1.82.2 eV. The experimental results are compared to those of Cu in Si, and common features and characteristic differences in the behavior of the two group 1 B metals are discussed.

Elemental concentrations and depth profiles of O, N, Ga were measured. Films deposited at 750 eV ion energy show that the Ga/N ratios are within 10% of unity and the Ga/O ratios are within 10-15%,, in the films having thicknesses ranging from 75 to 270 nm. Ga/N and Ga/O ratios in the films deposited at 800 and 900 eV were found to vary more than 10%. The Ga/N ratios of films produced at 400-750 eV are optimal for the production of single-phase a-GaN. There are only minor differences in the optical responses of these films and none at all in the Raman spectra within these levels of variation. Hydrogen analysis was also performed on the films using elastic recoil detection analysis with a 2.5 MeV4'He+ beam. This showed a surface enrichment of H in the thick films and low H concentration values of around 0.9%. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The accumulation and recovery of disorder on both the Si and C sublattices have been measured simultaneously using in situ 0.94 MeV D Rutherford backscattering Si-28(d,d)Si-28 and nuclear reaction C-12(d,p)C-13 along the <0 0 0 1>-axial channeling direction. The behavior of disorder accumulation and recovery on the Si and C sublattices is similar. The data suggest that a dynamic recovery stage occurs between irradiation temperatures of 190 and 250 K. At intermediate doses, isochronal annealing (20 min) results show that significant thermal recovery occurs between 420 and 720 K. Complete recovery is not observed by thermal annealing Lip to the highest temperature (870 K) used in this study. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

During implantation of He-4(+) with 2-10 keV at 295 K, an accumulation of H started in the He implanted layer when the retained He concentration saturated. For the crystal irradiated by 10 keV He at 820 K, a remarkable increase of H was found in the He saturated layer, after stopping the implantation and cooling down the crystal below 400 K. Though blisters and exfoliation were observed for the surface irradiated at 820 K, less lattice disorder was found in the implanted layer and the thermal release of H occurred at lower temperature, in comparison with the crystal implanted at 295 K.

The results show a constant corrosion rate of nickel alloy pipe (approximate to 4 nm/month), after a short running-in period. To simplify the use of this technique and to extend its application field, a Monte Carlo simulation program (Implantation of Recoil Ions Simulation) has been developed to calculate the depth profile of the implanted nuclei. It is associated with SRIM software for the transport of particles in matter. The validity and the interest of the IRIS computer program are demonstrated throughout the mentioned application.

In the past, ion implantation has been utilized to introduce these radioactive probes, resulting in a depth distribution of typically several hundreds of A, and damaging the sample. Both implantation-related deficiencies are incompatible with the ever shrinking sizes relevant in nanostructures. This problem can be circumvented by using ultra-low energy ion beams - of the order of 5 eV, i.e. below the displacement energy of the substrate atoms. Consequently, the radioactive probes are "deposited" on top of the sample. without generating damage to the substrate. Since the implantation chamber is in vacuo connected with the molecular beam epitaxy deposition chamber, the probe layer can be introduced at any stage during the sample growth (from surface to interface)-with monolayer depth resolution. As an example, we discuss the ultra-low energy ion deposition of In-111 in Cr. followed by analysis with perturbed angular correlation spectroscopy. The aim of the study is to explore the magnetic ordering of Cr thin films. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Williams, MMR				Williams, MMR			The effect of random geometry on the criticality of a multiplying system III: Three dimensional systems and spherical absorbers	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							TRANSPORT	A method has been developed for calculating the probability distribution of the multiplication factor in a system in which the fissile or absorbing elements are randomly distributed across the core and can have random material properties. It has practical applications to the storage of radioactive waste in drums in which fissile material is stored in a background matrix. The procedure is based upon the source-sink method of heterogeneous reactors developed by Feinberg, Galanin, Horning and Stewart in which the fuel element or absorber is replaced by a point sink of thermal neutrons and a point source of fast neutrons. The positions and material properties are sampled from a random distribution and a probability distribution is built up for the multiplication factor k(eff). Calculations are made for spheres in a cubic system and probability, distributions, mean values and variances are obtained for 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 and 25 spheres in both water and graphite moderated systems. Some interesting fine structure is found in the probability distributions which is attributed to preferred symmetric groupings of the spheres in the lattice. We also examine the effect of small random movements of the spheres about their mean positions and in particular study the effect of anisotropy of motion, i.e. perpendicular to the plane and in the plane, on the mean value of the multiplication factor and the associated probability distributions. Some experimental results obtained by, Lloyd on reactivity changes in random lattices are examined and qualitative agreement is obtained. A convenient form of the three dimensional Greens function for a rectangular box is developed which is especially, useful for numerical purposes due to its rapid convergence properties.

The assembly comprised fresh fuel with an average (235) U enrichment of 4.02 wt%, a maximum enrichment of 4.74 wt%, 14 burnable-absorber fuel pins, and full-density, water moderation. The experimental configuration investigated was core 1A of the LWR-PROTEUS Phase I project, where 61 different fuel pins, representing similar to64% of the assembly, were gamma-scanned individually. Calculated (C) and measured (E) values have been compared in terms of C/E distributions. For F-tot the standard deviations are 1.2% for HELIOS, 0.9% for CASMO-4, 0.8% for MCNP4B, and 1.7% for BOXER. Standard deviations of 1.1% for HELIOS, CASMO-4, and MCNP4B and 1.2% for BOXER were obtained in the case of C-8. Despite the high degree of accuracy observed on the average, it was found that the five burnable-absorber fuel pins investigated showed a noticeable underprediction of F-tot quite systematically, for the deterministic codes evaluated (average C/E for the burnable-absorber fuel pins in the range 0.974 to 0.988, depending on the code).

J	Suyama, K; Mochizuki, H; Kiyosumi, T				Suyama, K; Mochizuki, H; Kiyosumi, T			Revised burnup code system SWAT: Description and validation using postirradiation examination data	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						analyses of postirradiation examination; burnup calculation code; benchmark calculation	LIBRARIES	The burnup code system Step-Wise Burnup Analysis Code System (SWAT) is revised for use in a burnup credit analysis. An important feature of the revised SWAT is that its functions are achieved by calling validated neutronics codes without any changes to the original codes. This feature is realized with a system function of the operating system, which allows the revised SWAT to be independent of the development status of each code. A package of the revised SWAT contains the latest libraries based on JENDL-3.2 and the second version of the JNDC FP library. These libraries allow us to analyze burnup problems, such as an analysis of postirradiation examination (PIE), using the latest evaluated data of not only cross sections but also fission yield and decay constants. Another function of the revised SWAT is a library generator for the ORIGEN2 code, which is one of the most reliable burnup codes. ORIGEN2 users can obtain almost the same results with the revised SWAT using the library prepared by this function. The validation of the revised SWAT is conducted by calculation of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development/Nuclear Energy Agency burnup credit criticality safety benchmark Phase I-B and analyses of PIE data for spent fuel from Takahama Unit 3. The analysis of PIE data shows that the revised SWAT can predict the isotopic composition of main uranium and plutonium with a deviation of 5% from experimental results taken from UO2 fuels of 17 X 17 fuel assemblies. Many results of fission products including samarium are within a deviation of 10%. This means that the revised SWAT has high reliability to predict the isotopic composition for pressurized water reactor spent fuel.

The fuel cycle assessment was carried out by calculating the main performance parameters: natural uranium and separative work requirements, fuel cycle cost, and proliferation potential of the spent fuel. These performance parameters were compared with a corresponding slightly enriched (all-U) fuel cycle applied to a PWR of current technology. The main conclusion derived from this comparison is that fuel cycle requirements and fuel cycle cost for the mixed Th/U fuel are higher in comparison with those of the all-U fuel. A comparison and analysis of the quantity and isotopic composition of discharged Pu indicate that the Th/U fuel cycle provides only a moderate improvement of the proliferation resistance. Thus, the overall conclusion of the investigation is that there is no economic justification to introduce Th into a light water reactor fuel cycle as a homogeneous ThO2-UO2 mixture.

The properties include the radiotoxicity, decay heat, activity, and actinide content embedded in various spent fuels or high-level wastes, which could be measures of the effectiveness of waste management. From radiotoxicity analysis of fuel cycles, the toxicity of the DUPIC option based on 1 GW(electric) (.) yr is much smaller than those of other fuel cycle options such as the PWR once-through mode, mixed oxide fuel recycling mode, and CANDU once-through mode. The analysis shows that the value is just about half the order of magnitude of other fuel cycles until decayed to a level below the toxicity of initial ore. This means that the DUPIC option could have an indirect benefit on the environmental effects of long-term spent fuel disposal. From total activity analysis of various fuel cycle options, the activity per metric ton heavy metal of spent fuel is the lowest in natural uranium CANDU fuel, but in the case of activity based on 1 GW(electric) (.) yr, the DUPIC option has the smallest activity. In the meanwhile, from the activity analysis of Tc-99 and Np-237, which are important to the long-term transport in geologic media, the DUPIC option was being contained in only, about half of those other options. In conclusion, compared to other fuel cycle cases, the irradiated DUPIC fuels would have good properties from the perspective of environmental effects.

J	McFarlane, J; Wren, JC; Lemire, RJ				McFarlane, J; Wren, JC; Lemire, RJ			Chemical speciation of iodine source term to containment	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						iodine behavior; chemical thermodynamic modeling; Knudsen-cell effusion	CESIUM MOLYBDATE; VAPORIZATION; THERMODYNAMICS; DIOXIDE; UO2+X	Iodine species released into a reactor containment building following a loss-of-coolant accident is determined by the relative timing and quantity of iodine and other fission products released from the fuel, chemical thermodynamics in the fuel channel, and reaction kinetics in cooler regions of the heat transport system (HTS). Iodine speciation along the transport path from the fuel to cooler regions of the HTS and into containment is evaluated using chemical thermodynamics calculations, leading to a prediction of the volatile iodine mole fraction that theoretically would enter containment. Sensitivities to a decrease in the cesium-to-iodine ratio, a decrease in iodine concentration in the coolant, and an increase in oxygen partial pressure are tested. The role of the presence of other elements, namely, molybdenum, tellurium, uranium, and lithium, are also evaluated. Under most conditions, the mole fraction of iodine entering containment in volatile form is found to be <0.1%. There are circumstances, however, when cesium iodide can be destabilized by a low cesium-to-molybdenum ratio in an oxidizing atmosphere such as steam. To further explore this situation and to validate the code, chemical equilibrium calculations are also compared to earlier Knudsen-cell experimental studies of the interaction of cesium, iodine, molybdenum, and urania. In these experiments, the partial pressures of cesium molybdate and elemental iodine are measured as a function of temperature over the range 1100 to 1500 K.

J	Hedin, A				Hedin, A			Integrated analytic radionuclide transport model for a spent nuclear fuel repository in saturated fractured rock	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						analytic transport model; spent fuel; deep repository	CONTAMINANT TRANSPORT; POROUS-MEDIA; PARALLEL FRACTURES; SINGLE FRACTURE; SYSTEM	Simple analytic expressions are presented for radionuclide transport from a KBS 3-type repository, where spent nuclear fuel is placed in copper canisters surrounded by bentonite clay and deposited at a depth of 500 m in fractured granitic rock. Dissolution of readily accessible and fuel matrix embedded nuclides, chain decay, and nuclide precipitation is treated within the canister. Transport in the canister void and buffer is modeled with a dual stirred tank analogy, where transport resistances represent an assumed small initial damage in the canister and transport features of the buffer-geosphere interface. Initial, transient diffusion in the buffer is treated with a simple correction term. Chain decay is not included in the buffer. Geosphere transport expressions handle advection, longitudinal dispersion, matrix diffusion, sorption, and radioactive decay, but not chain decay. The treatment is based on earlier results for an instantaneous inlet and for a constant inlet to the geosphere in the nondispersive case. A correction is added so that longitudinal dispersion is taken approximately into account. The correction utilizes analytical expressions for the temporal moments of the geosphere release curve in the dispersive case. The near-field/geosphere integration is treated in a simplified manner avoiding numerical convolutions. The instantaneous inlet expression for the geosphere release is used when the near-field release decreases rapidly in comparison to a typical response tune in the geosphere; the constant inlet expression is used in the opposite case. Twenty-seven calculation cases from a safety assessment of a KBS 3 repository using borehole data from three different field investigation sites were repeated with the analytic expressions. The agreement in both near-field and geosphere releases is in general well within an order of magnitude for the variety of long- and short-lived, sorbing, nonsorbing, solubility limited, immediately accessible, and fuel matrix embedded single and ingrowing species dominating the releases and doses in the safety assessment calculations. Also, probabilistic dose calculation results are in good agreement, making the analytic model a versatile complement to the various tools used in long-term safety evaluations of a KBS 3 type of repository in saturated fractured rock.

Pyrolysis of the spent LLRA resin has been recognized to be very, effective in reducing the volume and mass of the waste. Experimentally, we found by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) method that the activation energy, for the pyrolysis of an LLRA resin was 319.2 kJ/mol. The reaction order and pre-exponential factor were 0.61 and 1.1 X 10(20) s(-1) respectively. Note that during the pyrolysis, similar to50% of the SO42- species in the resin was decomposed to SO2 at 673 to 873 K. At high temperatures (>873 K), most of the aromatics of the resin were also thermally cracked.

J	Raza, SS; Avila, RR				Raza, SS; Avila, RR			A comparison of direct gamma dose rates from a stationary Gaussian plume using different models	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Gaussian plume models; particle models; Lagrangian radiological models	TURBULENCE	The direct gamma dose rates due to a stationary Gaussian plume of radionuclides in the atmosphere have been calculated using different models [Lagrangian dose model (LDM), Gaussian plume model (GPM), and uniform cloud model (UCM)], and the results are compared. The atmospheric parameters (used in the Lagrangian model) like mean and fluctuating wind components, etc., were obtained from the published field data on a neutral atmosphere. In the LDM a continuous release of radionuclides into the atmosphere was simulated by liberating a large number of Lagrangian particles, whose trajectories were tracked for various hours in a three-dimensional computational domain. A point isotropic source formula was used for calculating the direct gamma dose contribution from all Lagrangian particles constituting the plume. Each particle represented a point source of radioactivity, whose strength a as calculated from the known release rate and was subsequently allowed to decay as a function of time. The comparison of the LDM results with the GPM indicated that both models predict comparable results in a homogeneous atmosphere. The LDM is, however, more versatile, as it can incorporate variation in meteorological data in space and time (of course when available). The UCM also compared well for ground releases; however; it cannot be used for elevated releases and short downwind distances. The purpose of this work was to test the LDM for simulating the transport, dispersion, and decay of a radionuclide plume. The LDM shall later be used for complex topographic and Meteorological conditions, where the GPM is not suitable.

This can produce a high radiation dose in small bodies of ice or rock. Such radiation may place constraints on the ability of living organisms to be transferred between planets or stellar systems because the mean interval between "sterilizing" doses is less than the expected transit time. In addition. a significant dose ( similar to 1 Gy) may penetrate the Earth's atmosphere with a mean interval of similar to 10 million years. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

A Thin Gap Chamber (TGC) will be used for forward muon triggering in the ATLAS experiment. According to a simulation, the main source of background around the TGC in the experimental hall will be neutrons and photons. In this report, we describe measurement of the sensitivity of the TGC to gamma-rays. The measurements were made with gamma-rays from radioactive sources with energies between 20 ke-V and 1.8 MeV. The sensitivity was found to be less than 1%, which is in good agreement with the EGS4-based simulator. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Below 4 MeV, the spectrum is dominated by radioactivities in the surrounding materials and rocks. Between 4 and 6 MeV, the shape of the spectrum is well explained by U, Th and daughters, which are internal contaminations in the NaI crystal. Between 6 and 10 MeV, the gamma-ray flux is strongly correlated with neutron captures in the surrounding materials. Finally, the gamma-ray flux above 10 MeV falls off and is related to the very weak cosmic muon flux via muon bremsstrahlung. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Careful analyses proved that the irradiation-induced resolution is strongly dependent of the hydrostatic pressure and a corrected formula has been proposed.

J	Bernard, LC; Jacoud, JL; Vesco, P				Bernard, LC; Jacoud, JL; Vesco, P			An efficient model for the analysis of fission gas release	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							IRRADIATION; MIGRATION; UO2	This paper presents the fission gas release (FGR) model that has been developed at Framatome ANP and incorporated into its fuel rod performance code COPERNIC in order to accurately predict FGR into pressurized water reactor fuel rods under normal and off-normal operating conditions including UO(2). gadolinia and MOX fuels. The model is analytical, thus enabling fast and robust fuel rod calculations. a must within an industrial framework where safety evaluations may require the analyses of a full core and of a very large number of transients. Although the model is simple, it includes the most important FGR features: athermal, thermal, steady-state, and transient regimes, burst effect, rim formation. and MOX-type microstructure. The validation of the model covers 400 irradiated rods that include high burnups, high powers, short to long transients, and shows the quality of the prediction of the model in all types of conditions. As temperature is a key parameter that affects FGR. the COPERNIC thermal model is briefly described and its impact on fission gas released uncertainty is discussed.

Namely, tritium would be released by the hydroxyl-exchange reaction between water and surface hydroxyl of silicate, not by the hydrogen-exchange reaction. Prior to the exchange reaction, water molecules are found to prefer adsorbing as proton acceptors in the water - silanol complex. whereas the hydroxyl-exchange reaction occurs from a complex with a different form, in which the water molecule adsorbs as a proton donor. The overall potential energy barrier is calculated as 24.4 kcal mol(-1) for the hydrogen release from the silicate in the presence of water molecules. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Experiments revealed that the density of the pellets doped with zinc compounds and sintered in CO2 also displayed a density decrease of 3%T.D. after resintering. Therefore, it was considered that the major cause of the large swelling of the pellets sintered in CO2 atmosphere after resintering was Zn residues. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The background reduction by Compton-event suppression made it possible to detect small peaks, which otherwise would not have been found in a conventional spectrum. In Compton-event suppression mode, the detection limit for Cs-137 was improved by a factor of about 3. for Am-241 we found a factor of 1.2 both in high and low active samples. The measurements of environmental reference samples showed good agreement with certifed values in both acquistion modes. The application of this instrument for the determination of fission products in smear samples is described. In particular, for nuclides like Mn-34, Sb-125, and Ce-144, an improvement in the detection limits by a factor of 1.6-2.4 was obtained. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Various aspects of the physical phenomena involved in the production Of Such radioactive beams are discussed, They include fragmentation cross-sections, energy losses in materials, ionic charge-state distributions, as well as ion Optics calculations and acceptance effects, This program is highly user-friendly, and is designed not only to forecast intensities and purities for planning future experiments, but also for beam tuning during experiments where its results can be quickly compared to on-line data. In addition, several general-purpose tools such as a physical parameters calculator, a database of nuclear properties, and relativistic two-body kinematics calculations make it useful even for experiments with stable beams. After a general description of fragment separators, the principles underlying the calculations are presented, followed by a practical description of the program and its features. Finally, a few examples of calculations are compared to on-line data, both qualitatively and quantitatively. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Pillay, AE				Pillay, AE			Cf-252: the potential for activation analysis of selected medium-weight and heavy elements in the limited neutron flux of a partially depleted 50 mu g source	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						Cf-252-source; neutron activation analysis		A 50 mug Cf-252 source, depleted by about 2 orders of magnitude from its original neutron output, was used to examine the sensitivity of neutron activation analysis for a selection of 20 pure materials and compounds containing elements with atomic numbers greater than 40. Generally speaking, the sensitivity is seriously restricted by the neutron flux of the source, but in certain specific cases the nuclear properties of the elements concerned, such as thermal absorption cross-section, isotopic abundance and half-life of the radioactive product were considered for the production of a practicable gamma-ray yield. A description of the irradiation assembly and the conditions of activation are presented. Detection limits varied between 30 mug g(-1) to 8.2 mg g(-1) based on the most suitable gamma-ray of the radionuclide of interest. For purposes of determining trace and minor concentrations of selected elements, a source of this nature could be acquired at a nominal cost especially in developing countries that do not have access to a nuclear reactor.

J	Bouhlassa, S; Aiachi, A				Bouhlassa, S; Aiachi, A			Groundwater dating with radiocarbon: application to an aquifer under semi-arid conditions in the south of Morocco (Guelmime)	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						dating; radiocarbon; groundwater; correction; model; isotope; Morocco	DISSOLVED CARBON; MODELS	Radiocarbon dating is based on measuring the loss of the parent radionuclide (C-14) in a given sample. This assumes two key features of the system. The first is that the initial concentration of the parent is known and has remained constant in the past. The second is that the system is closed to subsequent gains or losses of the parent, except through radioactive decay. But. the reaction and evolution of the carbonate system strongly dilute the initial C-14 activity in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). The result is an artificial "aging" of groundwater by dilution of C-14. Unravelling the relevant processes and distinguishing C-14 decay from C-14 dilution is an engaging geochemical problem. Several attempts to overcome these problems have been made during the past 30 years and a number of possible correction procedures have been presented by different authors. Environmental isotopes study (C-13, C-14) from the aquifers of the Guelmime under semi-arid conditions provides new information on recharge zones, mixing zones and the circulation routes of water. The combination of logP(CO2) the saturation index of dolomite and calcite, HCO(3) over bar, delta(13)C, C-14 and pH along flow paths can provide an indication of open- and closed-system conditions in the Oumlaachar and Seyyad sub-basins. This approach of geochemical analysis, when combined with correction procedures. allows us to understand age and recharge in the Guelmime aquifer. C-14 groundwater ages range from modern to about 2700 years in this aquifer. and indicate recharge values of 0.55-15mm/yr. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The model was developed for use in the mechanistic RTOP fuel element code. The model is based on theoretical ideas about the mechanisms leading to the,formation of the radial burnup profile and a simplified description of the neutron spectrum in the reactor, employing the idea of a hardness parameter. The hardness parameter gives the ratio of the thermal and superthermal parts of the neutron spectrum and is the only free input parameter of the model. The results, presented in the paper, of a comparison of the predictions of the model with the experimental data show that the model possesses much better predictability than the currently most widely used module - TUBRNP.

J	Lauvergeon, A				Lauvergeon, A			The contribution of nuclear power to the continuity of supply in Europe	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article; Proceedings Paper	Winter Meeting of the Deutschen-Atomforums eV	FEB 01-02, 2001	BERLIN, GERMANY	Deutsch Atom Forums eV				The perspectives of nuclear power are determined by a number of aspects, first of all, by the generating capacity requirement. As a consequence of the development in the electricity markets, new nuclear power plants are now the exception rather than the rule. However, this is a snapshot which does not reflect the future situation, as new generating capacities will have to be added in the next few years. A trend towards nuclear power plant construction is discernible in a number of countries and regions, such as Finland, France, Russia, North America, and the Far East. In some European countries, the political tendencies in power announced that they would not permit any new nuclear power plants to be built. The other aspect are the problem areas to be considered. The management of radioactive waste is an important subject as far as public acceptance of nuclear power is concerned. Technical solutions and a general will to solve the waste management problem, as in Finland, show that waste management is a safe proposition provided it is really wanted. Moreover, it must be made clear that the reality of public opinion is not distorted by vociferous minorities. Opinion polls conducted, for instance, in France and another in Germany reveal a clearly higher acceptance of nuclear power, of which the public must be made aware. With respect to another major problem, the protection of the world's climate, express reference must be made to the contribution, and the potential, of nuclear power free from CO2. Nuclear power therefore must be included in the list of clean development mechanisms also because it is available as an economically viable option. In view of these problems in the future we need all forms of energy without banning any of them.

J	Rittscher, D; Hager, M; Krause, F				Rittscher, D; Hager, M; Krause, F			The Greifswald and Rheinsberg Nuclear Power Stations: Decommissioning, demolition, and disposal	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								The Greifswald site (KGR) contains eight reactor units of the VVER 440 type as well as other facilities for the treatment and storage of fuel elements and radioactive waste. Units 1-4, which were operated in the power mode, were shut down after the unification of Germany, and the trial operation of unit 5 was discontinued. Construction work on units 6-8 was terminated. A precursor of this type of reactor is located on the Rheinsberg site. After thorough examination in 1990 and 1991, the decision was taken to decommission and immediately dispose of the total of six activated and contaminated units, respectively. After the necessary permits had been obtained, disassembly and demolition work on this biggest present nuclear power plant decommissioning project in the world was begun in 1995. The entire waste management concept was designed with the focus on the management of the considerable volumes of nuclear fuels, waste from plant operation, and the waste streams arising in decommissioning. Smooth operation of the overall project is ensured thanks to the construction of the Zwischenlager Nord (ZLN) interim storage facility, whose installations for treatment and storage constitute the key elements in the waste management chain. At present, the main activity within the project is the disassembly, on a model scale, of the reactor pressure vessel and its internals to ensure the reliability of the tools and steps in hot remote operation. This model-scale disassembly is about to be completed successfully. Work on the reactor of unit 2 will be started soon. Despite the special circumstances arising from German unification, Energiewerke Nord (EWN) GmbH succeeded in revamping the company so as to meet the new requirements, obtain the necessary permits in time, and advance the project speedily.

J	Helwig, U; Boessert, W				Helwig, U; Boessert, W			Disassembly and disposal of the nuclear installations of VKTA on the Rossendorf research site	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								The Verein fur Kernverfahrenstechnik und Analytik Rossendorf e.V. (VKTA) has been commissioned to shut down and dismantle the old nuclear installations of the former Central Institute for Nuclear Research of the Academy of Sciences of the GDR on the Rossendorf research site, some of which have existed since 1957, and to properly dispose of the nuclear fuels and radioactive waste. The application of the West German Atomic Law beginning in 1991 resulted in a difficult situation. A great number of new licenses was necessary as also equivalent structures at the licensee and the responsible authorities. All this tasks have been completed in time. New infrastructure was created for this purpose, such as facilities for the interim storage of nuclear material and the treatment for radioactive waste. The special activities are described in this contribution. Three demolition complexes were created at VKTA. Demolition complex I combines all reactors and the former experimental uranium facility. Demolition complex 2 includes all plants and buildings connected with the former isotope production. The former waste stores and the special sewer system constitute demolition complex 3. The status of decommissioning activities is presented, and the material to be managed as waste is described. In conclusion, an outlook is presented of the future activities of VKTA on the basis of the "VKTA 2000 plus Concept" approved by the Saxonian cabinet early this year.

J							ILK	ILK statement about the potential suitability of the Gorleben site as a geologic repository for radioactive waste	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								The International Nuclear Technology Committee (ILK) presents a statement outlining the criteria and positions relative to the final storage of radioactive waste and the potential suitability for this purpose of the Gorleben site. Two sets of questions are dealt with: (1) Site selection, including the site selection procedure. Reference is made to a number of criteria on which the past site selection had been based, and to aspects of general importance. The important fact is that the selected site of Gorleben stood, and continues to stand, a good chance of being a suitable site. (2) The required safety level: The comprehensive site exploration program for Gorleben is considered an important basis. The fact is criticized that, in the absence of the moratorium decided upon by the federal government, a complete database would be available for a properly qualified scientific and technical evaluation. No new aspects are seen in the list produced by the federal government with scientific and technical doubts about the suitability of the Gorleben site. Moreover, even if there were such aspects, they would not rule out the installation of a safe geologic repository in salt in general or at Gorleben in particular. The ILK arrives at the conclusion that it us up to a societal or political decision to write off investments into a potentially suitable site. Subjects in need of further clarification accordingly should be treated and advanced by the appropriate scientific and technical methods.
