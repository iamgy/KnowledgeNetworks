J	Pitts, M; Rahnema, F				Pitts, M; Rahnema, F			Analysis of unplated subcritical experiments using fresh fuel assemblies	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							SPECTRAL DENSITY-MEASUREMENTS; CF-252	The number of spent nuclear fuel assemblies taken from nuclear power plants and to be stored in existing storage pools is increasing. Therefore, there is a need to optimize the storage configurations. The computer codes and cross sections used to analyze proposed storage configurations must be validated through comparison with experimental data. Restrictive values of k(safe), caused by limited data, can prevent optimal storage utilization. As a collaborative effort between Westinghouse Safety Management Solutions, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Georgia Institute of Technology, and the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR), more than 120 experiments were performed using four highly enriched MURR fuel assemblies. The Cf-252-source-driven noise analysis technique developed at ORNL was used as the measurement method for these experiments. This method is based on calculating a specific ratio of measured auto-power and cross-power spectral densities. Twenty-two unique configurations from the MURR experimental program were analyzed for benchmarking purposes. These subcritical experiments were described and analyzed in this paper to provide new measurements to increase the amount of data available for benchmarking criticality codes and cross sections for systems that are far front critical (k(eff) < 0.9). All aspects of the experimental apparatus designed for the experiment program are thoroughly described to enable calculational modeling. Measured and calculated results for the 22 configurations of interest are given. Thorough perturbation studies on measurement uncertainties (e.g., fuel spacing and composition) were performed to determine the uncertainty on the ratio and k(eff) values. Inferred k(eff) values ranged from 0.648 +/- 0.005 to 0.860 +/- 0.006. A simplified benchmark model is described that consists Of the four fuel assemblies, four He-3 detectors, detector drywells, and the water reflector. For these measurements, the calculated ratio and k(eff) values agreed with the measurement results within the measurement uncertainty. All of the analyzed configurations were considered acceptable for validation of computer codes and cross sections.

J	Liu, LC; Neretnieks, I				Liu, LC; Neretnieks, I			A reactive transport model for oxidative dissolution of spent fuel and release of nuclides within a defective canister	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						spent fuel; dissolution; nuclide transport model	HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS; MASS-TRANSPORT; ADSORPTION; URANIUM(VI)	In this study, we develop a mechanism-based model to take into account most of the important processes that may influence the dissolution behavior of spent fuel and subsequently the release behavior of nuclides within a defective canister in a final repository for high-level nuclear waste. The model is, in essence, a redox-controlled reactive transport model that provides a description of the mass transport of multiple species involved in both local equilibrium and kinetically controlled reactions in the system. The complexity of the kinetics of the various redox reactions involved and the requirement of the long-term prediction, however, make numerical implementation of the fully coupled model computationally inefficient. A series of scoping calculations was performed to highlight the local characteristics and behaviors of the system, and to provide a basis for refinement of the reactive transport model. The results indicate that the rapid buildup of hydrogen within the system is mainly attributed to corrosion of the cast-iron insert that primarily occurs under anaerobic conditions, rather than to radiolysis of water. The system that is rapidly in equilibrium with 50 bar hydrogen would then keep pH constant throughout the system. In addition, simulations suggest that reduction of dissolved hexavalent uranium by ferrous iron adsorbed onto the corrosion products and by dissolved H-2 are the most important mechanisms to retard the release of uranium out of the canister. More importantly, it is found that the pseudo stationary state approximation may well be applied to the system. This greatly simplifies the numerical implementation of the reactive transport model.

J	Esh, DW; Scheetz, BE				Esh, DW; Scheetz, BE			Thermohydrological effects on a nonreactive aqueous species in unsaturated fractured geologic materials	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						thermohydrochemical; unsaturated; TOUGH2	FLOW; TRANSPORT; MODEL	The chemical and mineralogical conditions of the near-field, i.e., that area in the vicinity of the waste materials, may be significantly altered from ambient conditions by thermohydrological processes resulting from the placement of heat-generating radioactive materials in a geologic repository. Models are developed linking the thermohydrological effects simulated with TOUGH2 to a nonreactive aqueous species (chloride). Perturbations in near-field chemistry from the ambient conditions may have potential impacts on engineered barrier system (EBS) performance, waste-form degradation processes, and radionuclide transport. The results of thermohydrological simulations with TOUGH2 utilizing various conceptual models for fracture representation are coupled to simple chemical models (density and osmotic effects are neglected) to demonstrate the complexity and potential magnitude of thermohydrochemical (T-H-C) processes. The concentration of chloride in solution returning to the EBS following dryout, in extreme cases, is predicted to exceed 100 000 mg/l. The dimensionality of the problem and the rate at which the tuffaceous rocks rewet significantly affect the magnitude of the thermohydrological impact on chloride redistribution. A process metric (initial rewetting rate and distribution) that is ignored when evaluating thermohydrological response is very important when a more complex coupling (T-H-C) is considered.

A 3-5 MeV scanning electron beam linear accelerator (which is currently used for processing semiconductor devices) was employed to change the color of white topaz under room-temperature conditions, together with a cooling device. A radiation-induced ion color center is formed in white topaz by an electron beam. To finish the irradiation, the total dose needs to be more than 5 x 10(7)-1 x 10(8) Gy, the temperature of heat-treatment was between 180degreesC and 280degreesC in air conditions, after a while, a sky blue topaz was obtained. There was a bright color and no radioactivity was formed in the sky blue topaz by this production method. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The effect of ionising radiation was probed by transmission measurements performed before and after each irradiation on all analysed samples. From these data, the radiation-induced absorption coefficient was calculated, proportional to the density of colour centres induced by irradiation in the solid matrix. Results are discussed by taking into account the possible dependence of radiation hardness on the composition of glass matrix. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

An experimental set-up was installed in a CERN PS proton beam line to study how neutrons produced by spallation at relatively high energy (E-n greater than or equal to 1 MeV) slow down quasi-adiabatically with almost flat isolethargic energy distribution and reach the capture resonance energy of an element to be transmuted where they will have a high probability of being captured. Precision measurements of energy and space distributions of spallation neutrons (using 2.5 and 3.5 GeV/c protons) slowing down in a 3.3 m x 3.3 m x 3 in lead volume and of neutron capture rates on LLFFs Tc-99, I-129, and several other elements were performed, Ail appropriate formalism and appropriate computational tools necessary for the analysis and understanding of the data were developed and validated in detail. Our direct experimental observation of ARC demonstrates the possibility to destroy, in a parasitic mode, outside the Energy Amplifier core, large amounts of Tc-99 or I-129 at a rate exceeding the production rate, thereby making it practical to reduce correspondingly the existing stockpile of LLFFs. In addition, TARC opens up new possibilities for radioactive isotope production as all alternative to nuclear reactors. in particular for medical applications, as well as new possibilities for neutron research and industrial applications, (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Koo, YH; Lee, BL; Cheon, JS; Sohn, DS				Koo, YH; Lee, BL; Cheon, JS; Sohn, DS			Modeling and parametric studies of the effect of inhomogeneity on fission gas release in LWR MOX fuel	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							MIXED-OXIDE FUELS; PLUTONIUM	To analyze the effect of an inhomogeneous mixture of an PuO2 powder on fission gas release in MOX fuel, a model has been developed using the assumption that gas release mechanism in Pu-rich particles is identical with that in. UO2 fuel. A parametric study was performed to see the respective effect of the number density, size and fraction of Pu retained in the Pu-rich particles on gas release in MOX fuel. The model shows that, for the condition of all the other remaining parameters being fixed, more gas is released in a MOX fuel for lower number density of, smaller size of, and larger fraction of Pu retained in, the Pu-rich particles. However, there exists some condition or combination of parameters for which the effect of inhomogeneity on gas release is negligible depending on the characteristics of MOX fuel. Comparison with measured data for OCOM MOX fuel shows that the present model can predict the level of gas release in MOX fuel once the release mechanism in the Pu-rich particles is known.

J	Akansu, SO; Unalan, S				Akansu, SO; Unalan, S			Investigation of the flattened fissile fuel enrichment possibility with a (D, T) driven hybrid blanket cooled by flibe (Li2BeF4)	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							CANDU SPENT FUEL; NEUTRONIC PERFORMANCE; REJUVENATION; REACTOR; IMPROVEMENT; MODERATORS	This work investigated the possibility of the fuel production with flattened cumulative fissile fuel enrichment (CFFE) at the hybrid reactor, to be cooled by the flibe (Li2BeF4) and fueled by UO2 with a LWR fuel rod and CANDU fuel rod diameters, LWR spent fuel and CANDU spent fuel, with an original fuel rod diameter during the operation period of 5 years. For that purpose, the new fuel zone structure is provided by means of the ratio of the flibe to fuel per fuel row in the fuel zone being varied. Neutronic performance of the (D, T) driven hybrid blanket with this fuel zone is followed by a plant factor of 75% under a. first wall load of 5 MW/m(2). The fuel row numbers are selected as 10. For all fuels, the possibility of the fuel production having almost the same CFFE in all fuel rows of the fuel zone of the hybrid blanket is possible by a deviation of 2%. Moreover, the fissile fuel production capability of the suggested blanket increased considerably. However, tritium breeding ratios and the displacement-per-atoms (dpa) values in the first wall and clad material are almost not affected by this blanket structure, the energy production decreased slightly. At the end of the operation period of 5 years, the CFFE value reached approximate to8.5, approximate to9.3, approximate to8.4 and approximate to8.2% for UO2 with LWR rods, LWR spent fuel, UO2 with CANDU rods and CANDU spent fuel, respectively. The remaining fuel from hybrid blankets with CANDU and LWR spent fuels have enough safety from the viewpoint of the plutonium non-proliferation since the isotropic percentage of Pu-240 in the produced plutonium is higher than 7%. However, other cases with UO2 fuel can reach sufficient safety after an operation period of 30 months. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Schwarz, G; Ridder, K				Schwarz, G; Ridder, K			The regulatory framework concerning the safe transport of radioactive material in the European Union	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			English	Article								Radioactive materials of natural and manmade origins are employed worldwide in many areas, such as medicine, research, energy generation, and industry. As a consequence of the special nature and the properties of radioactive substances, irregular handling and use of such materials entails hazards. This is why special safety and protection provisions have been made in the interest of protecting health, life, property, and the environment from such hazards. The development and use of harmonized goals of protection and standards of safety is essential to free trade and the exchange of goods and services within the European Union and worldwide. The national and international institutions and organizations responsible for the protection and safety of transports of radioactive materials, including the European Union and its member countries, early on recognized the need for harmonized safety standards and criteria for transports of dangerous goods and developed an appropriate system of standards of safety and protection and a comprehensive set of tools for monitoring and checking observance of these standards. These tools have been laid down in a system of legally binding agreements, regulations, directives etc., or in recommendations, for the fifteen EU member states. The article presents this system of legally binding agreements, regulations, and recommendations, respectively, which covers the protection and safety of national and international transports of radioactive materials.

This requires the generation of a plasma of high temperature (>100 million degreesC) and the necessary density. Studies of problems of plasma physics are accompanied by developments of the technologies for fusion reactors in scientific installation. These technologies are to be employed in the international test reactor, ITER, currently in the planning stage. Within the European Fusion Research Program, the Karlsruhe Research Center makes major contributions in plasma heating, superconducting magnets, energy conversion in the blanket, the fuel cycle of ITER, primary vacuum pumps for ITER, and structural materials and erosion of armoring materials (the latter two items will be covered in part II of this Article in atw 3 (2002)). The planned ITER plant needs plasma heating powers of approx. 70-150 MW. Work performed at the Karlsruhe Research Center under this heading mainly comprises the development of microwave oscillators (gyrotrons) and their use for an electron cyclotron resonance heating system and for non-inductive plasma current operation. The plasma, which is approx. 100 million degreesC hot, is confined in a "magnetic cage" so as to avoid any contact with the wall structures of the vacuum vessel. Building up a magnetic field of this magnitude requires field strengths of at least 2-5 tesla in the plasma; field strengths of 11-13 tesla at the magnet coils are required for future fusion plants, such as ITER. Consequently, the development of the required future superconducting magnet coils enjoys high priority. The blanket, i.e. the enclosure around the combustion chamber of a fusion reactor, plays a major role in the design of a future fusion power plant. Blanket concepts meeting technical requirements are being developed and studied. A blanket must meet three requirements: It must convert the neutron energy into heat, breed the tritium fuel by nuclear reactions, and shield the magnets from neutron and gamma radiations. The fuel cycle of fusion reactors is determined by the gaseous phase of the two hydrogen isotopes, deuterium and tritium. In general, hydrogen handling technologies have been developed to a high level, but can be transferred to the handling of deuterium and radioactive tritium only to a very limited extent. Consequently, the necessary development work is carried out. The state of the plasma, also with respect to its purity, is a factor of special importance, as impurities will cause the plasma to dissolve and thus the fusion reaction to break down. Primary vacuum pumps, another area of activity of the Karlsruhe Research Center, first must evacuate the reactor vessel and then, during operation, maintain the necessary atmosphere.

J	Kuhn, K				Kuhn, K			Final storage in Germany. Who is interested?	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								The final storage of radioactive waste and spent fuel in Germany - who, in Germany, has any interest in this subject, especially now that the new Atomic Energy Act has been adopted, and who is going to read this article? The author, Professor Klaus Kuhn, examines this question, analyzing in his contribution the current situation and the points of view of those who may be interested in this topic. In Prof. Kuhn's opinion, the addressees in particular are these: the federal government, the opposition in the federal parliament, the federal states, the Federal Ministry for the Environment, the Federal Ministry for Research, the Federal Ministry of Economics, the Federal Office for Radiation Protection, the operators of nuclear power plants, the Working Group Elaborating Procedures for Selecting Repository Sites (AkEnd). Klaus Kuhn concludes that there is little interest at the present time in the subject of Final Storage in Germany, for reasons explained in detail which result both from the political constellation and from existing constraints.

J	Knizia, K				Knizia, K			The THTR-300 - an opportunity missed?	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article								Approximately thirty years ago, construction of the thorium high-temperature reactor (THTR-300) was started in HammUentrop. A new epoch in generating nuclear power was to begin, as this reactor line cooled by helium gas, was to be used not only for electricity generation, but also to supply high-temperature heat for a variety of uses. Accordingly, the federal and state governments together with the group of operators supported the development of this line. High-temperature reactors of the THTR-300 concept are characterized by these features: integrated design of the reactor pressure vessel; high safety and technological advantages of the reactor concept employing graphite fuel spheres and helium as a chemically inert primary coolant; high inherent safety as a result of the overall concept; optimum thermodynamic parameters of the high-efficiency water-steam cycle. The construction and operation of the THTR-300 suffered from a number of obstacles in the forms of licensing technicalities and licensing policy, which caused major delays in completion. In the absence of any perspectives of continued operation, the shareholders decided to decommission the plant in 1988. After the first partial construction permit in 1971, a total of 16 partial construction permits with 21 supplements and 1 350 new conditions had been considered necessary by the licensing authority up to the date of full commissioning. The planned delivery period of approx. 60 months thus grew to almost 200 months. As a consequence, the original costs of construction of approx. EUR 350 million rose to approx. EUR 2 050 million. Valuable experience was accumulated in the 16,410 hours of operation of the THTR-300. On the whole, the concept turned out to be excellent, also thanks to the commitment of all participating scientists, engineers, and economists.

J	Rood, AS; Grogan, HA; Till, JE				Rood, AS; Grogan, HA; Till, JE			A model for a comprehensive assessment of exposure and lifetime cancer incidence risk from plutonium released from the Rocky Flats Plant, 1953-1989	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						plutonium; risk analysis; inhalation; Monte Carlo	SOILS	A model was developed to calculate ambient air concentrations, surface deposition, and lifetime carcinogenic risk with uncertainty from plutonium released to the air from the Rocky Flats Plant between the years 1953 and 1989. The model integrated airborne release estimates and atmospheric dispersion and deposition calculations from 37 years of routine plant operations and episodic releases. Episodic releases included two major fires in 1957 and 1969 that breached the building air filtration systems, and suspension of plutonium contaminated soil from the former 903 waste storage area during high winds. Predicted air concentrations included contributions from site releases and resuspension from contaminated soil. Inhalation was the only exposure pathway considered. Environmental measurements suitable for model validation were lacking for the period when major site releases occurred (1953 to 1970). However, environmental media, such as soil and lake sediment, are natural accumulators and provided evidence of past offsite releases. The geometric mean predicted-to-observed (P/O) ratio for soil was 0.93 with a geometric standard deviation of 1.6. The model systematically underpredicted concentrations near the 903 Area because large, nonrespirable particles that deposited close to the source were not included in release estimates. Plutonium soil inventories for the model domain had P/O ratios ranging from 0.22 to 4.2. The geometric mean P/O ratio for ambient air was 0.90 with a geometric standard deviation of 2.6. Age-dated sediment cores from Standley Lake had a geometric mean P/O ratio of 1.0 with a geometric standard deviation of 1.7. Predicted-to-observed ratios for plutonium inventories in Great Western Reservoir ranged from 0.36 to 1.7. Lifetime cancer incidence risks were calculated for a male laborer scenario who resided in the model domain for the entire assessment time. Maximum cancer risks ranged from 10(-6) (5th percentile) to 10(-4) (95th percentile). Most of the exposure was incurred during the 1950's.

J	Peterson, SR; Davis, PA				Peterson, SR; Davis, PA			Tritium doses from chronic atmospheric releases: A new approach proposed for regulatory compliance	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						tritium; modeling, dose assessment; emissions, atmospheric; regulations	IN-VITRO DETERMINATION; CHRONIC HT RELEASE; BIOLOGICAL-SYSTEMS; CHALK-RIVER; FALLOUT H-3; VEGETATION; OXIDATION; SOIL; JAPAN; AIR	Regulatory models for atmospheric releases of tritium approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (CAP88, AIRDOS-PC, and COMPLY) calculate doses only from tritiated water (HTO) taken into the body. They do not deal with dose from emissions of tritiated hydrogen gas (HT) and conversion of HT to HTO in the environment, nor do they address the dose from ingesting tritium incorporated into organic compounds. A simple model (NEWTRIT) is proposed that accounts for all pathways to dose from atmospheric releases of HT and HTO. The model is formulated in terms of the tritium-to-hydrogen ratio in each environmental compartment. With each transfer, a small reduction in the ratio is introduced to reflect the dilution that occurs in nature. Conversion of HT to HTO in the environment is modeled using the latest experimental data. Concentrations of organically bound tritium are calculated in foodstuffs based on amounts of hydrogen in proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. Concentrations in foodstuffs and doses calculated by NEWTRIT are consistent with the predictions of existing regulatory models. In addition, the HTO component of NEWTRIT is tested using public bioassay data and the HT component is tested using results from a model intercomparison study for a hypothetical HT release. Although tritium doses probably have not been underestimated by regulatory models that account only for HTO (due to the high degree of conservatism built into these models), the explicit treatment of HT and organically bound tritium proposed here will make the dose assessments more comprehensive, defensible, and scientifically acceptable.

Recent experimental work has improved the state of knowledge of relevant processes and parameter ranges. The results presented in this paper represent a first approach to a detailed assessment of doses from radiopollutant deposition on the human body, based on contaminant-specific data. Both the dose to skin from beta-emitters and the whole-body dose from gamma-emitters on body surfaces were found to give potentially significant contributions to dose. Further, skin penetration of some contaminants could lead to significant internal doses.

Meteorological data are available only for a small number of locations, but routine field measurements in 1997 of exposure rates in areas still contaminated by Cs-137 revealed that there is a natural indicator of wet deposition. Follow-up measurements confirmed that there is a significant difference in exposure rates measured on different sides at the bases of inclined birch trees in areas of wet deposition. In such areas, the exposure rates measured on the "sheltered" sides of the trees were on average 2.3 +/- 0.2 times those measured on the unsheltered side. In areas of dry deposition the comparable ratio was 1.01 +/- 0.02 for similarly inclined trees. Because birch trees are a common feature in the contaminated territories, this effect has a wide potential for use in determining whether the fallout in many areas was due to wet or dry deposition.

J	Munyon, WJ; Lee, MB				Munyon, WJ; Lee, MB			Summary of stationary and personal air sampling measurements made during a plutonium glovebox decommissioning project	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						air sampling; aerosols; plutonium; decontamination		Workplace air sampling was performed during the decommissioning of a previously active plutonium glovebox facility located at Argonne National Laboratory. Personal air samplers (PAS) were used to measure breathing zone activity concentrations of workers engaged in size-reducing contaminated gloveboxes. Stationary air samplers (SAS) were used to measure the work area activity concentrations and test their application in providing representative sampling of breathing zone activity concentrations. The relative response of these samplers (PAS:SAS) was tracked during the course of the decommissioning work, with results yielding favorable agreement to within a factor of +/-5. A cascade impactor was used to determine the particle size distribution of workplace aerosols. The average activity median aerodynamic diameter (AMAD) was estimated to be 3.0 mum, with a corresponding geometric standard deviation of 2.4. A gas-flow proportional counter was utilized to measure the gross alpha activity collected on both the SAS glass fiber and the PAS cellulose fiber filters. A subset of this filter group was subsequently analyzed using an alpha spectrometer post radiochemical processing and isotopic separation. The quantity of alpha activity measured on the SAS filters was generally within +/-30% of the alpha spectrometry measurements. However, measurements made of the activity present on the PAS cellulose fiber filters were consistently underestimated using a gas-flow proportional counter, suggesting a small correction factor of 15-20% to account for the absorption of alpha particle emissions.

J	Aker, RE				Aker, RE			Historical site assessments - They're not just for decommissioning anymore	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topic; radioactivity; removal of; decontamination; nuclear reactor		At the conclusion of its mission, every nuclear facility eventually undergoes decommissioning. An early and essential part of decommissioning is the conduct of an extensive site characterization process. A Historical Site Assessment (HSA), a critical aspect of the site characterization process, sufficiently informs the facility owner anti stakeholders of the radiological contaminants on the facility site. This allows for a safe anti optimal decommissioning process. Although many nuclear facilities in the United States are permanently closed, many are entering a long-term storage condition typically known as safe storage (SAFSTOR). In these cases, only minimal characterization may be conducted initially. Full characterization may not occur for several decades. Additional delays in decommissioning will occur in operating facilities that successfully extend their operating licenses. In both of these cases, the conduct of a robust HSA can provide a valuable and cost-beneficial decommissioning step. This paper suggests that a substantial portion of the early site characterization process should be conducted prior to the conclusion of a facility's mission.

This diminished support occurs despite the fact that the potential for laser-related occupational injuries is much greater than the potential for injury from radioactive materials used in biomedical research. Therefore, a small emphasis on laser safety can potentially produce a much greater return on investment than more conventional health physics programs. Dei,eloping and implementing a formal laser hazard evaluation procedure provides an efficient mechanism for identifying potential laser safety hazards and offers a great professional development opportunity in this important area of health physics expertise. This paper outlines a process for developing such a university laser hazard evaluation program.

Often radioactive material vendors' safety literature fills this need, but may leave out key information (e.g., site-specific requirements) that the radiation safety program would like to convey. Instead, the Nuclide Safety Data Sheet concept provides this safety information using a hazard communication medium and format-the Material Safety Data Sheet-that is well established in the work-place. In addition to allowing institutions to customize the information provided to radioactive material users, the Nuclide Safety Data Sheet also gives workers a familiar format in which to view radiation hazard communication information.

Researchers using radioisotopes that placed orders from a partnering vendor were afforded an added price discount if verified by the institutional radiation safety program to be ill compliance with laboratory-contamination survey requirements. The program piloted for I period of 1 y, resulted in a total institutional savings of approximately $2,200 and a 27% improvement in compliance with targeted objectives when compared with previous years. Feedback from pilot participants was extremely positive, its the program served to shift the perception of the radiation protection program from one that sanctions non-compliance to one that rewards compliance. The relative success of the pilot program suggests that the approach may be broadly applicable both within radiation safety programs and other safety-related settings as well.

J	Lubenau, JO				Lubenau, JO			Too many notes?	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topic; accidents; nuclear; regulations; waste storage		Orphan sources tire now recognized as a radiation protection problem needing, attention. Government and private sector initiatives have been mounted in response. Should more be done? There are promising possibilities. Under the ICRP 60 system of radiation protection, any rise at radiation should be justified. Key NRC licensing regulations predate ICRP 60 and, consequently, if a use is authorized by license, then the we is presumed to be justified even if alternatives tire available. As an example, x-ray, gauges can be successfully substituted for nuclear container fill level gauges in the food and beverage industry But this development is not widely known to potential users and regulators, and current regulatory, policies do not address this. Limiting the number of radioactive devices would limit the number of potential orphan sources. From an operational radiation safety point of view, persons wanting to dispose of unneeded or unwanted radioactive sources are filled with a system loaded with disincentives, in part because disposition options tire riot well known and in part becauses options have become limited, complex, and expensive. New approaches are needed if the orphan source problem is to be effectively addressed. Paramount are the needs to (1) update U.S. regulatory policies to incorporate the ICRP principle of justification, (2) create a system that encourages prompt, sale dispositioning of unneeded and unwanted radioactive sources, and (3) make information on these points universally, known to users of radioactive sources.

Comparison of an alpha-emitting radioimmunoconjugate and external gamma-irradiation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION BIOLOGY			English	Article							HEMATOPOIETIC STEM-CELLS; ANTI-CD20 ANTIBODY; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; HUMAN OSTEOSARCOMA; B-CELLS; RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY; PARTICLES; SURVIVAL; I-131; CD20	Purposes: The alpha-emitting radionuclide At-211 conjugated to the CD20 targeting chimeric monoclonal antibody rituximab was studied to: (a) Estimate radiation dose components to lymphoma and bone marrow (BM) cells exposed in vitro. (b) Calculate the mean absorbed radiation doses in various normal tissues of mice following intravenous injection. Materials and methods: B-lymphoma cells (RAEL) and normal human BM cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of the radioimmunoconjugate. Based on binding kinetics and on measured cellular and nuclear diameters, the radiation doses were calculated using microdosimetric methods. Results: Targeting of At-211-rituximab to RAEL cells was extensive and stable compared with the binding to BM cells. The absorbed radiation doses from cell-bound activity at an initial activity concentration of 10 kBq ml(-1) were 0.645 and 0.021 Gy to RAEL and BM cells, respectively. In comparison, the contribution from unbound conjugate in the medium during 1 h exposure was 0.042 and 0.043 Gy. The D-0 value for RAEL cells was 0.55 Gy, but only 0.34 Gy for BM cells, whereas corresponding D-0 values were 0.72 and 1.21 Gy after a single exposure to external Co-60 gamma-rays. Mean absorbed doses of 1.31, 0.48 and 0.36 Gy for blood, lungs and heart were calculated in mice injected with 5.4 kBq g(-1) of At-211-rituximab. Conclusion: Despite the higher inherent sensitivity of the BM cells to the alpha-irradiation, there was, related to the radioactivity concentrations of At-211-rituximab, several logs greater cell kill in RAEL cells, illustrating the tumour-specific nature of the targeting.

The ADS dedicated to transmutation is the key technology of the double-strata fuel cycle concept. The proposed system is a lead-bismuth cooled, nitride fuel 800 MW ADS for transmutation of minor actinides and long-lived fission products. JAERI has carried out a conceptual design study under the joint project between JAERI and KEK (High Energy Accelerator Research Organization) on high-intensity proton accelerators. In addition to a high-intensity proton accelerator complex, two experimental facilities are planned for development and demonstration of accelerator driven transmutation technology: The major objective of an ADS physics experimental facility is to obtain reactor physics data of hybrid suberitical system. The major objective of an ADS engineering experimental facility is to accumulate material data for the design of a lead-bismuth target system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

From the tritium inventory point of view, it is absolutely necessary to understand the short-term and long-term hydrogen isotopes retention characteristics of the individual materials used for the first wall and divertor. From the plasma density and fueling point of view, it is necessary to understand the recycling characteristics of these materials. This report is an overview of the available data on hydrogen isotope retention and recycling for beryllium, tungsten, carbon, and selected liquid metals.

J	Laux, D; Cros, B; Despaux, G; Baron, D				Laux, D; Cros, B; Despaux, G; Baron, D			Ultrasonic study of UO2: effects of porosity and grain size on ultrasonic attenuation and velocities	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							URANIUM-DIOXIDE	Ultrasonic techniques applied to nuclear fuel characterisation are developed in our group since 1996. Before applying our methods to irradiated fuel, we are searching sensitive parameters which could give interesting information. That is the reason why only results concerning non-irradiated UO2 are presented. This paper mainly deals with the investigation of a relevant acoustic parameter: the attenuation. Indeed. the ultrasonic attenuation in UO2 as a function of the operating ultrasonic frequency has been measured on samples with various microstructures: variable fraction volume porosity (1-6%) and grain size (10-90 mum). Using a 15 MHz operating frequency, no attenuation has been observed. With frequencies around 40 MHz. we show that the measured ultrasonic attenuation is only sensitive to grain size (no effect of porosity has been observed). On the contrary, the ultrasonic velocities (which are very sensitive to porosity) are not affected by the sizes of the grains. These reversed and non-correlated effects constitute an interesting toot for UO2 study because two aspects of the microstructure can be studied separately with ultrasonic waves.

The objective of the study was to determine whether proton irradiation does indeed emulate the full range of effects of in-reactor neutron irradiation: radiation-induced segregation (RIS), irradiated microstructure, radiation hardening and IASCC susceptibility. The work focused on commercial heats of 304 stainless steel (heat 13) and 316 stainless steel (heat P). Irradiation with protons was conducted at 360 degreesC to doses between 0.3 and 5.0 dpa to approximate those by neutron irradiation at 275 degreesC over the same dose range. Characterization consisted of grain boundary microchemistry, dislocation loop microstructure, hardness as well as stress corrosion cracking (SCC) susceptibility of both un-irradiated and irradiated samples in oxygenated and de-oxygenated water environments at 288 degreesC. Overall, microchemistry, microstructure, hardening and SCC behavior of proton- and neutron-irradiated samples were in excellent agreement. RIS analysis showed that in both heats and for both irradiating particles, the pre-existing grain boundary Cr enrichment transformed into a W shaped profile at 1.0 dpa and then into a 'V' shaped profile between 3.0 and 5.0 dpa. Grain boundary segregation of Cr. Ni, Si, and Mo all followed the same trends and agreed well in magnitude. The microstructure of both proton- and neutron-irradiated samples was dominated by small, faulted dislocation loops, Loop size distributions were nearly identical in both heats over a range of doses. Saturated loop size following neutron irradiation was about 30% larger than that following proton irradiation. Loop density increased with dose through 5.0 dpa for both particle irradiations and was a factor of 3 greater in neutron-irradiated samples vs. proton-irradiated samples. Grain boundary denuded zones were only observed in neutron-irradiated samples. No cavities were observed for either irradiating particle. For both irradiating particles, hardening increased with dose for both heats, showing a more rapid increase and approach to saturation for heat B. In normal oxygenated water chemistry (NWC) at 288 degreesC, stress corrosion cracking in the 304 alloy was first observed at about 1.0 dpa and increased with dose. The 316 alloy was remarkably resistant to IASCC for both particle types. In hydrogen treated, de-oxygenated water (HWC), proton-irradiated samples of the 304 alloy exhibited IG cracking at 1.0 dpa compared to about 3.0 dpa for neutron-irradiated samples, although differences in specimen geometry, test condition and test duration can account for this difference. Cracking in heat P in HWC occurred at about 5.0 dpa for both irradiating particles. Thus, in all aspects of radiation effects, including grain boundary microchemistry, dislocation loop microstructure, radiation hardening and SCC behavior, proton-irradiation results were in good agreement with neutron-irradiation results, providing validation of the premise that the totality of neutron-irradiation effects can be emulated by proton irradiation of appropriate energy.

Thorium dioxide feed powders thus prepared were cold compacted without binder or lubricant and sintered to a high density ( greater than or equal to 9.5 Mg m(-3)) at relatively low temperatures ( less than or equal to 1623 K). The powders were characterised for the residual carbon, crystallite size, specific surface area. particle size distribution and bulk density. The distribution of the dopant in the thoria matrix was analyzed by electron probe microanalysis. The reactivity of the calcined powders was determined by measuring the density of the sintered compacts prepared from them. For the first time it is demonstrated that apart from niobia, even tantala and vanadia can bring about accelerated sintering in thoria if they are doped through a wet chemical route viz., the gel-combustion procedure. The maximum densities obtained by doping with vanadia (0.02 mol%), niobia (0.50 mol%) and tantala (0.50 mol%) were 9.8 Mg m(-3) (1573 K), 9.68 Mg m(-3) (1423 K) and 9.69 Mg m(-1) (1623 K), respectively.

J	Hertz, KL; Causey, RA; Cowgill, DF				Hertz, KL; Causey, RA; Cowgill, DF			The effect of coatings on deuterium retention and permeation in aluminum 6061-T6 APT tritium production tubes	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							ION-IMPLANTED DEUTERIUM; HYDROGEN; COPPER; RELEASE	The accelerator production of tritium project will utilize spallation neutrons incident on thousands of He-3 gas filled metal tubes to produce tritium by way of the exothermic He-3(n,p)H-3 reaction. Tritons with energies up to 192 keV and protons with energies up to 576 keV are directly implanted into the tube walls. To minimize tritium retention in the tubes and permeation into the coolant surrounding the tubes, it is desirable to have the implanted tritium migrate back to the inner surface of the tubes and rapidly recombine to be released as T-2 and HT. Aluminum alloy (Al 6061-T6) is the primary candidate material for fabrication of the tubes. Aluminum alloy samples implanted with deuterons and protons to fluences as high as 3 x 10(22) D (and p)/m(2) were studied. Deuterium retention was measured by mass spectrometry during thermal desorption. Approximately 10% of the implanted deuterium was retained. Copper, nickel and anodized coatings on aluminum alloy were studied as possible methods of reducing retention and permeation of the tritium. In these experiments, the Cu and Ni coatings reduced the retention significantly, whereas retention increased in the anodized coated sample. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

An important issue concerning these materials is the investigation of their ability to confine radiotoxic elements resulting from the fission of actinides. This letter reports the study of the release. upon annealing or irradiation at high temperature, of one of the most toxic fission product (Cs) in zirconia. The foreign species are introduced by ion implantation and the release is studied by Rutherford backscattering experiments. The results emphasize the decisive influence of the fission product concentration on the release properties. The Cs mobility in zirconia is strongly increased when the impurity concentration exceeds a threshold of the order of a few atomic per cent.

J	Kleykamp, H				Kleykamp, H			Fission product precipitates in irradiated uranium carbonitride fuel	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Letter								Austenitic steel-cladded uranium carbonitride fuel pins were irradiated in the BR2 up to 6.4% burnup. A cross-section of the pin RV 24 with the fuel composition UC0.86N0.09O0.05 was prepared for X-ray microanalysis of the fission product precipitates. Rare-earth oxide and U(Mo,Tc)C-2 phases were observed in the whole fuel region, Bright phases present in annular rings of the outer fuel zone were identified as U-2(Tc, Ru, Rh)C-2. Alkaline-earth oxide and U-Pd-Ni phases were shown in the fuel-cladding gap. The rare-earth and alkaline-earth fission products extracted the oxygen from the fuel matrix which became nearly oxygen free. The formation of nitrides could not be detected.

The chemical composition near surface of the fine fragments of the oxidized specimen was measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The appreciable enrichment of tin oxide SnO2 near surface of fine fragments was observed, and it was attributed to the segregation of tin oxide SnO2 at the grain boundaries of zirconium oxide. It was also concluded that tin oxide SnO2 was not dissolved in ZrO2 in the initial stage of oxidation at temperatures below 873 K, and that the solubility of SnO2 in ZrO2 at 1,173 K was larger than 0.23 mass%. The diffusion coefficient of tin in the monoclinic phase of ZrO2 at 1,173 K was evaluated to be in the order of magnitude of 10(-1)9-10(-18) cm(2)/s.

Chromatography was performed in a break-through manner by feeding a zinc chloride solution into the columns. The mass analysis revealed that the heavier isotope was enriched at the front part of the zinc adsorption band. This result means that the heavier isotopes are preferentially fractionated into the solution phase. The largest single-stage separation coefficient (epsilon) in the present work is 1.0x10(-3) for the isotopic pair of Zn-64 and Zn-66 at 35 degreesC.

The abnormal outflow affected the concentration profile in the same manner as the decrease in the rate of the corresponding liquid flow rate entering the bank. The results suggested that the solvent extractor at the aqueous inlet stage in stripping banks and the solvent extractor at the organic inlet stage in extraction banks should be carefully designed to restrict the respective abnormal aqueous and organic outflows within the normal operational liquid flow rate range. Combining the result and the inherent phase separation behavior of the extractor suggested the possibility of designing the process with the self-controlled function of throughput, which eases the change of the concentration profile due to the undesirable increase in the rate of liquid flow rate entering the bank. Basically the proposed approaches are probably applicable to other general extraction and stripping processes.

J	Ko, WI; Kim, HD; Yang, MS				Ko, WI; Kim, HD; Yang, MS			Radioactive waste arisings from various fuel cycle options	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						radioactive waste; radwaste generation; fuel cycle; material flow; DUPIC; waste management		This study examines all kinds of waste volumes from various fuel cycle options including DUPIC (Direct Use of Spent PWR Fuel In CANDU) fuel cycle and compares each other. The fuel cycle option considered the PWR (Pressurized Water Reactor) once-through cycle, the PHWR (Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor) once-through cycle and the thermal recycling option using an existing PWR with MOX (Mixed Oxide) fuel. This study focuses on the radioactive wastes including mill waste, low-level waste and high-level waste generated by all fuel cycle steps, which can be one of the effectiveness measures of waste management. All waste disposition volume is estimated in terms of m(3)/GWe-yr. We find in the estimation of radioactive waste volume that PWR-MOX option has the lowest mill tailings and spent fuel volumes among the options, but the option has high volume of ILW and HLW. Mill tailings and spent fuel volumes of the DUPIC fuel cycle are lower than those of other competitive options such as PWR-PHWR once-through cycle. PWR once-through cycle has the lowest LLW and ILW volume among the options, but has high mill tailings and spent fuel volume. The data obtained in this study would be helpful to further estimate environmental effect and/or waste disposition costs in various fuel cycle options.

J	Schnier, C				Schnier, C			A new hypothesis for the existence of superheavy elements in the earth's crust	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ALPHA-RECOIL; SERIES DISEQUILIBRIUM; NOBLE-GASES; URANIUM; GROUNDWATER; TRANSPORT; CONSTRAINTS; GENERATION; SUPERNOVA; STATE	In a new hypothesis the existence of superheavy elements (SHE) in the earth's crust that decays by spontaneous fission into two unequal fragments around 50 and 230 is postulated. Several phenomena such as excesses of stable and unstable isotopes and radioactive daughter isotopes in natural decay series are interpreted as fission fragments of spontaneously splitting long-lived SHE. These phenomena are only indirect indications, not a proof of the existence of SHE.

J	Cosma, C				Cosma, C			Some aspects of radioactive contamination after Chernobyl accident in Romania	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							FALLOUT; CS-137; SR-90	After the Chernobyl disaster, the radioactive cloud passage over Romania beginning with the April 30th, 1986 caused fall-out of different intensities in different regions.. The principal contributors to the radioactive exposure during the month of May and rest of 1986 were the short and medium half-live radionuclides: Te-132+L-132 L-131, Ba-140+La-140, Ru-103+Rh-103, Ru-106+Rh-106, Zr-95+Nb-95, Cs-136, Ce-141, Ce-144 and Sb-125. After four-five years only Cs-137 and Sr-90 remained significant radioactive contaminants. During May 1986 the grass was the mostly affected component of the environment and it contaminated rapidly the majority of foods. Measurements made on the daily gathered pollen samples and eggs during May 1986 clearly indicated that these samples can be used as bioindicators of radioactive contamination of the atmospheric air and, respectively, for soil and grass. Regarding soil contamination, the higher Cs134+137 deposits in Romania following the northeast-southwest direction were measured, some of these being above 80 kBq/m(2). This direction is the same with the cloud passage over Romania during the first week of May 1986 and it was confirmed by measurements in the former Yugoslavia, Albania, Greece, and south of Italy.

J	Premadas, A; Srivastava, PK				Premadas, A; Srivastava, PK			Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometric determination of lanthanides and Y in various uranium hydrometallurgical products	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							RARE-EARTH ELEMENTS; SOLVENT-EXTRACTION; GEOLOGICAL-MATERIALS; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; YTTRIUM; ROCKS; SEPARATION; EXCHANGE; THORIUM; PRECONCENTRATION	An ICP-AES method for the analysis of trace amounts of lanthanides and yttrium in sodium or magnesium diuranate samples (yellow cake) and other beneficiation product generated during the uranium extraction process (hydrometallurgy) from its ores is described. Most of the matrix elements are removed by an initial oxalate precipitation of lanthanides using calcium as carrier. A solvent extraction procedure using a mixture of mono 2-ethylhexyl dihydrogen phosphate (H2MEHP) and bis (2-ethylhexyl) hydrogen phosphate (HDEHP) is used for the removal of calcium, iron and the occluded uranium. A combination of oxalate precipitation and solvent extraction procedure is applied for the selective separation and preconcentration of traces of lanthanides from yellow cake and iron cake samples. The solvent extraction procedure is directly applied for the separation of lanthanides from the uranium leach liquor and lime cake. The accuracy of the method is checked by analyzing synthetic mixture containing known amounts of traces of lanthanides and also by comparing with another standard separation procedure like ion exchange method, and the recovery was better than 95%.

Sertraline was labeled with I-131 by using iodogen method. Labeling yield was 85-90% and specific activity was approximately 64.75 GBq/mmol. The purification of radioiodinated Sertraline was performed by Sep Pak C-18 plus and the radiochemical purity was determined to be over 99%. Biodistribution studies were carried out by male Albino Wistar rats. The percentage of injected radioactivity per gram of tissue was calculated, and these data versus time curves were generated for organs and brain regions. The results showed that I-131 labeled Sertraline may be a promising radiopharmaceutical for the investigation of serotonin 5-HT receptor functions of brain.

In order to follow the distribution of radioactive ions Cs-137(+), Co-60(2+) and Cr-51(3+) in various cell components extracted from Spirulina platensis, Porphiridium cruentum, Scenedesmus quadricauda, Lemna minor, Elodea canadensis, Pistia stratiotes and Riccia fluitans, the plants were cultivated in radioactive solutions. The resulting complexes were extracted with acetone or acetic acid and separated chromatographically. The results show an intense activity of the polysaccharide and lipoid fractions in the bioaccumulation process. The bioaccumulation varies in the series: Spirulina > Scenedesmus > Porphiridium > Riccia > Pistia > Lemna greater than or equal to Elodea for Cs-137(+) and Co-60(2+); Spirulina > Porphiridium > Scenedesmus > Riccia > Pistia > Lemna > Elodea for Cr-51(3+).

Preliminary tests showed that, the effect of different parameters such as uranium oxidation stage, temperature and the molar ratio of D2EHPA/TOPO on the uranium recovery was in good agreement with those of previous investigations. However, a detailed investigation into the effect of phosphoric acid concentration, organic concentration and acid/organic phase ratios suggested that the mechanism of D2EHPA/TOPO synergism was rather complex and it presented a different character depending on the acid concentration.
