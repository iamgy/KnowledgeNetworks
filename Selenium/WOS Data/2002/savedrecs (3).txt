J	Ogorodnikov, BI				Ogorodnikov, BI			Origin and components of radioactive aerosols on the cover site at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								It is shown that essentially three sources determine the Cs-137 concentration in aerosols at the site of the object Cover at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. a natural source (global transport of air masses and local wind uplift of dust) and two technogenic sources (work performed at the industrial site and operation of the object). Continual aerosol sampling for two weeks at the site in 2000 using FPP-15-1,5 filters shows that the Cs-137/(241)AM ratio remained in the range 50-70. This shows that during that period the artificial radioactive aerosols resulted from work performed at the site and wind uplift. The effect of work performed inside the object Cover on the aerosol conditions around the object is studied for the fire which occurred on January 14, 1993 in room 805/3.

J	Abraham, S				Abraham, S			Generation IV International Forum 2002 - Remarks	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			English	Article								Analyses and forecasts underscore the important role of nuclear power in energy supply in the 21 st century. Important aspects in this respect are the conservation of fossil resources, the protection of the world's climate, and the continuity of supply. Present 1st and 2nd generation nuclear power plants ensure an economical and technically mature electricity supply. Advanced systems offering, e.g., higher efficiency of fuel utilization, simplified systems technology, and advanced safety characteristics, can make available additional benefits in using nuclear power. Upon an initiative of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), ten countries combine their efforts in developing such reactor concepts in the Generation IV International Forum (GIF). Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Japan, South Africa, South Korea, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States pursue the common objective in GIF to identify suitable nuclear power systems and promote their development up to the envisaged readiness for construction in 2030. Besides technical and economic questions of nuclear power generation, also other aspects must be considered with a view to the future use of nuclear power. The particularly relevant issues, such as the management of radioactive waste, the intensification of research and development, and international cooperation, have been taken up by the Bush administration at an early point in time and have been, or will be, incorporated in practical solutions, as in the case of the Yucca Mountain repository project.

J	Rosenberger, S				Rosenberger, S			US nuclear power stations reduce liquid waste processing costs and clean liquid waste to the detection limits	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			English	Article								Deregulation in the United States since 1995 has given rise to a consolidation wave and to immense cost pressure. At the same time, great efforts are being undertaken to reduce radioactivity releases. The two objectives seem hardly compatible. As a response, a method of treatment of liquid waste has been developed on the basis of ultrafiltration membranes and ion exchangers. The article covers the main underlying physics principles and the methodological steps which must be taken into account in a successful introduction of a technique like this. The problem of an efficient and cost-effective treatment of the concentrate from ultrafiltration plants has been solved for the first time in Solids Collection System, on which a patent has been applied for. The only liquid leaving the system is clean water. Several U.S. nuclear power plants have meanwhile decided in favor of adopting this new method. Experience accumulated at the Callaway pressurized water reactor is cited as an example in the article. This nuclear power plant, whose annual arisings of contaminated liquid effluent totaled up to 6 000 m(3), had pursued the aim, among others, of reducing the total activity to less then 9.25 E9 Bq or 1 500 Bq/l. On the basis of a plant throughput of 120 l/min, the new method is employed to clean the liquid effluent to levels between 0.37 Bq/l and 3.7 Bq/l. The waste volume is reduced by roughly 75%, with major cost reductions resulting as a consequence.

J	Fabian, HU				Fabian, HU			Nuclear waste and spent fuel management - Kept on a political backburner	ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE			German	Article							FINAL STORAGE; TECHNICAL BASIS; GERMANY	The nuclear controversy has dominated the media and the public at different levels of intensity for more than thirty years. Especially the "unsolved" problem of nuclear waste management is used as an argument against nuclear power. This partly ignores or disregards the concepts, work, and findings about the repositories and the repository sites of Gorleben and Konrad. The German federal government made up of the Social Democrats (SPD) and Alliance 90/The Greens introduced a concept, after it came into power in 1998, which is hardly feasible, its purpose being the construction of one single repository around 2030. This delays a solution of nuclear spent fuel and waste management in Germany, and it is also associated with tremendous economic burdens to the government, and with a potential for further societal conflict, also because of the possibility of another site selection procedure. Repositories and repository projects abroad, on the other hand, demonstrate that the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle has been solved technically. The emplacement, in this country, of chemical and toxic wastes in underground repositories, which imposes the same requirements in terms of safety, demonstrates the feasibility and responsibility of this approach even in Germany. The problem of final storage could be solved more speedily if exploration work in Gorleben were resumed, technical and scientific problems were handled quickly and with a solution in mind, if executability at short notice of the plans approval decision for Konrad were examined, and if the appropriate administrative preconditions were established for repository research and the allocation of competences in the field of final storage.								*AKEND, ARB AUSW ENDL AUSW E; *BMU, 2001, ABL KLAR SICH EINZ E; Clos KD, 2002, ATW-INT Z KERNENERG, V47, P302; *DTSCH BUND, 2001, BT DRUCKS 14 7840 V; *GRUPP OK, 1998, AN ENTS BUND DEUTSCH; Holmes J, 1999, ATW-INT Z KERNENERG, V44, P647; *IEG, 2001, GORL REP PROJ GORL E; *ILK, 2000, STELL INT LAND KERNT; *ILK, 2002, ATW, V47, P262; Kuhn K, 2000, ATW-INT Z KERNENERG, V45, P540; Kuhn K, 2000, ATW-INT Z KERNENERG, V45, P453; Kuhn K, 1996, ATW-INT Z KERNENERG, V41, P627; Petroll MR, 1999, ATW-INT Z KERNENERG, V44, P641	13	0	0	1	2	VERLAGSGRP HANDELSBLATT GMBH	DUSSELDORF	POSTFACH 10 11 02, D-40002 DUSSELDORF, GERMANY	1431-5254			ATW-INT Z KERNENERG	ATW-Int.

A strong effort is also devoted to the validation of the design of an intense 14 MeV neutron source (IFMIF). The material programme includes the development of reduced activation ferritic martensitic steel (EUROFER) to be used as structural material in a DEMO reactor, and potentially more attractive higher performance materials: ODS and SiC/SiC composites. The breeding blanket activities are focussed in the preparation of the two European Test Blanket Moduli to be installed in ITER. The Fuel Cycle activities for ITER include development of the torus exhaust cryopump, fuel storage system, performance characterisation of the torus exhaust processing and design of water detritiation system. High heat flux components have been developed in the framework of ITER R&D programme and based on copper alloy heat sink protected by an armour of beryllium, CFC or tungsten. Studies give an important contribution in defining the nuclear technology programme strategy. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Okui, T; Matsuhiro, K; Nishikawa, M				Okui, T; Matsuhiro, K; Nishikawa, M			Performance characteristics of pebble flow for pebble divertor	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	APR 07-12, 2002	SAN DIEGO, CA			pebble divertor; multi-layer pebble; pebble curtain; block flow model; heat and particle removal		The pebble divertor concept is proposed for the high-power density fusion reactor. In this system, a large number of multi-layer pebbles are dropped in the divertor region to form the pebble curtain as the divertor plate. The multi-layer pebble consists of three layers, i.e. kernel, a plasma facing layer and an immediate tritium permission barrier. The performance characteristics of the pebble flow are related to flow rate and flow pattern for shielding the incident particle flux. In this study, we have studied fundamental designs of the dropping system. The dropping system consists of a container with the single slit at the bottom. The pebbles are stored in the cuboid container. In the experiment, the dependence of the flow rate of the pebble on the slit width is observed. Al(2)O(3) pebbles and active carbon pebbles were used at the point of view for mechanical performance instead of using the multi-layer pebbles because the multi-layer pebble is very expensive now so that it is difficult to prepare a large number of pebble enough to perform the experiment. In the calculation, we estimated the dependence of the flow rate on the slit width. The calculation results have been coincident with the experimental results. It is possible to estimate the relation between slit width and flow rate of the multi-layer pebble with SiC kernel. From this study, the pebble curtain can shield more than 90% of heat flux from core plasma when the slit width is more than 3 cm. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Initial lithium limiter experiments were conducted with a toroidally-local liquid lithium rail limiter (L3) from the University of California at San Diego (UCSD). Spectroscopic measurements showed a clear reduction of impurities in plasmas with the L3, compared to discharges with a boron carbide limiter. The evidence for a reduction in recycling was less apparent, however. This may be attributable to the relatively small area in contact with the plasma, and the presence of high-recycling surfaces elsewhere in the vacuum chamber. This conclusion was tested in subsequent experiments with a fully toroidal lithium limiter that was installed above the floor of the vacuum vessel. The new limiter covered over ten times the area of the L3 facing the plasma. Experiments with the toroidal lithium limiter have recently begun. This paper describes the conditioning required to prepare the lithium surface for plasma operations, and effect of the toroidal liquid lithium limiter on discharge performance.

Deuterium retention is explored as a function of plasma ion fluence in the range 6 x 10(19)-4 x 10(22) atoms cm(-2) and exposure temperatures of 523-673 K. The results are consistent with full uptake of the deuterium ions incident on the liquid metal surface, independent of the temperature of the liquid lithium. Full uptake continues until the sample is volumetrically converted to lithium deuteride. Helium retention is not observed for fluences up to 5 x 10(21) He atoms cm(-2). Measurements of the erosion of lithium are found to be consistent with physical sputtering for the lithium solid phase. However, a mechanism that provides an increased evaporative-like yield and is related to ion impact events on the surface, dominates during the liquid phase leading to an enhanced loss rate for liquid lithium that is greater than the expected loss rate due to evaporation at elevated temperatures. Further, the material loss rate is found to depend linearly on the incident ion flux, even at very high temperature. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Test Blanket Modules (TBMs) based on these two concepts will be tested in ITER during the first 10 years of operation. The EU R&D programme is mainly focussed on the development and characterisation of materials: structural (EUROFER), breeding (Pb - 17Li, Li(4)SiO(4), Li(2)TiO(3)) and neutron multiplier (beryllium), and manufacturing technologies (powder and solid HIP, joining, tritium permeation barrier).

The ITER parameters have been revised during this period and it was not clear that for new conditions a reasonable test program could be developed. Considerable extrapolations have to be made from the ITER conditions to those of a potential fusion reactor. To cope with the problems an approach to testing based on the 'act alike' principle has been developed. Key aims of the tests are code validation and verification of design assumptions based on calculations and results of out-of-pile or in-pile experiments. It is shown that most of the important breeding' blanket functions can be investigated with the parameters of ITER, and that the blanket test program can be synchronized with the machine operational scenario. It is recommended that a strong effort be maintained on this area of R&D in the future. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Several studies have been performed in the past. The most recent proposals are the TAURO blanket concept in the European Union, the ARIES-AT concept in the US, and DREAM concept in Japan. The first two concepts are self-cooled lithium-lead blankets, while DREAM is an helium-cooled beryllium/ceramic blanket. Both TAURO and ARIES-AT blankets are essentially formed by a SiCf/SiC box acting as a container for the lithium-lead which has the simultaneous functions of coolant, tritium breeder, neutron multiplier and, finally, tritium carrier. The DREAM blanket is characterized by small modules using pebble beds of Be as neutron multiplier material, of Li2O (or other lithium ceramics) as breeder material and of SiC as shielding material. The He coolant path includes a flow through the pebble beds and a porous partition wall. For each blanket, this paper describes the main design features and performances, the most recent design improvements, and the proposed manufacturing routes in order to identify specific issues and requirements for the future R&D on SiCf/SiC.

The purpose of the tests is to validate the design principles and the operational feasibility for the demonstration blanket system. This includes the basic support functions like tritium extraction, helium cooling and heat transport, and helium purification. In addition, the basic properties and operating characteristics of the system's materials will be validated. Safety, reliability, maintenance and dismantling will be equally addressed. To assess these qualities, the ITER horizontal ports will be used to provide a relevant fusion plasma and the appropriate nuclear environment. At conclusion of the ITER feat EDA phase (July 2001), a revised design of the HCPB test blanket system have been completed to adapt the previous design (for ITER FDR) to the new operational conditions of ITER and to a new strategy for the blanket testing in this reactor.

However, its structural property, especially the possibility of non-stoichiometric composition, has not been well established yet. Therefore, the composition of Li2TiO3 has been further investigated by means of thermogravimetry, XRD etc. Also, thermal diffusivity measurement was carried out. Mass of Li2TiO3 was found to change after the change of the atmosphere from hydrogen to oxygen as observed by means of thermogravimetry. At the same time, the color was observed to change from dark blue to initial color, white. These behaviors suggest not only oxygen deficient but also lithium oxide deficient defects formation. Thus, the doubly non-stoichiometric composition, Li2-xTiO3-y, has been confirmed. Further, it was shown by thermal diffusivity measurement that 95Li(2)TiO(3) (i.e. Li2O/TiO2 = 0.95) has a higher thermal conductivity than 100Li(2)TiO(3). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

For the thermo-mechanical characterisation of such pebble beds, bed compression experiments are the standard tools. New bi-axial compression experiments on 20 and 30 mm high pebble beds show pebble flow effects much more pronounced than in previous 10 mm beds. Owing to the greater bed height, conditions are reached where the bed fails in cross direction and unhindered flow of the pebbles occurs. The paper presents measurements for the orthosilicate and metatitanate breeder materials that are envisaged to be used in a solid breeder blanket. The data are compared with calculations made with a Drucker-Prager soil model within the finite-element code ABAQUS, calibrated with data from other experiments. It is investigated empirically whether internal bed friction angles can be determined from pebble beds of the considered heights, which would simplify, and broaden the data base for, the calibration of the Drucker-Prager pebble bed models.

The method of tritium inventory estimation was proposed by the present authors. The overall mass transfer coefficient of the isotope exchange reaction 1 between H-2 in the purge gas and tritium on grain surface of Li2TiO3 was obtained in this study. This equation shows that the rate of isotope exchange reaction 1 in the Li2TiO3 bed is much smaller than that was observed by the authors for Li2O, LiAlO2, LOA, and Li2ZrO3. This phenomenon is caused by a surface reaction that occurs at high temperature between Li2TiO3 and H-2 in the gas phase. It was observed that the color of Li2TiO3 surface was changed from white to black, and quartz tube was corroded by this reaction. Tritium inventory in the Li2TiO3 blanket estimated in this study is about ten times larger than for any other solid breeding blanket at 973 K. It must be also cared that most tritium is released as HTO in this case. The use of He with H-2 on purge gas of Li2TiO3 blanket gives contradictory effect. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

In fact global dimensions and output power of ITER-FEAT have been approximately reduced by a factor of 3. The BB under study corresponds to the main solutions of ITER-98 project [1] [2], that is: breeder in tube, consisting of pellets of a Lithium compound; neutron multiplier made of a pebble bed of Beryllium; cooling plates (using pressurized water as coolant) as basic cell boundaries; stainless steel as structural material. This paper deals with the neutronic as well as the thermal mechanical analyses of the envisaged BB in order to assess its performances in terms of Tritium production and thermal mechanical resistance. The code MCNP version 4B [3] has been used for the neutronic analyses while the thermal-mechanical analyses have been performed by means of the FEM codes MARc and ANSYS. The preliminary analyses demonstrated that the proposed BB verifies the temperature constraints for the Breeder (temperature contained in the 'thermal window') as well as for the multiplier (Be temperature lower than 500 degreesC, but the configuration of the breeder and multiplier in the basic cell have to be modified in order to obtain a Tritium Breeder Ratio larger than 1.

One of its main objectives is to demonstrate the availability and integration of technologies essential for a fusion reactor by testing of components for a future reactor including the tritium breeding modules. Hence, a task for all the ITER Parties (EU, JA, RF) that are engaged in the blanket development, is to draw up a Testing Programme aiming at exploiting the unique features of this machine, but also to take into account its intrinsic limitations. In this paper the Testing Programme for the EU Helium Cooled Pebble Bed (HCPB) Blanket concept is presented. The test strategy is based on four different Test Blanket Modules (TBM) each devoted to a family of objectives (electromagnetics, neutronics and tritium production, thermomechanics and plant integration); the general external design of these modules is similar, but intemals, instrumentation and operation mode will be different to cope with the specific testing objectives. These modules will be successively irradiate starting from the beginning of ITER operation; the time schedule of the tests of each module is co-ordinate with the different plasma operations (H-H phase, D-D, etc.).

This specific goal has been maintained also in ITER-FEAT program even if the general design parameters of the TBMs have reported some changes. This paper is focused on the investigation of the WCLL-TBM nuclear response in ITER-FEAT through detailed 3D-Monte Carlo neutronic and photonic analyses. A 3D heterogeneous model of the most recent design of the WCLL-TBM has been set-up simulating realistically its new lay out and taking into account 9% Cr martensitic steel as structural material. It has been inserted into an existing 3D semi-heterogeneous ITER-FEAT model accounting for a proper D-T neutron source. The analyses have been performed by means of MCNP-4C code running on a cluster of four workstations through the implementation of a parallel virtual machine. The main WCLL-TBM nuclear responses have been determined focusing the attention on power deposition density, material damage through displacement per atom (DPA) and He and H production rate, daily tritium production and tritium production rate radial distribution in the module. Moreover, the impact of using lithium at various Li(6) enrichment on the TBM nuclear response has been investigated. The results obtained are herewith presented and critically discussed.

However, because of its lower Li concentration relative to LiF-BeF(2) (Flibe, with ratio 2:1), its deployment as a breeder has been a concern. In this paper, we compare the local tritium breeding ratio (TBR) of Flinabe to Flibe in two arrangements: (1) as a FFLL and breeder in the blanket; and (2) as only the FFLL with LiPb/SiC conventional blanket following the FW. The impact of the choice of ferritic steel (FS) and SiC as the structural material on TBR was also examined. In addition, the paper discusses what constitutes a reasonable value for local TBR if all sources of uncertainties in the achievable and the required TBR are considered (e.g. modeling, nuclear data, burn up rate in the plasma, etc.) (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Because tritium is both radioactive and expensive, it is absolutely necessary that there be an understanding of the tritium retention characteristics of the materials used in these devices as well as how to recover the tritium. There are three materials that are strong candidates for plasma-facing-material use in next-step fusion devices. These are beryllium, tungsten, and carbon. While beryllium has the disadvantage of high sputtering and low melting point (which limits its power handling capabilities in divertor areas), it has the advantages of being a low-Z material with a good thermal conductivity and the ability to get oxygen from the plasma; Due to beryllium's very low solubility for hydrogen, implantation of beryllium with deuterium and tritium results in a saturated layer in the very near-surface with limited inventory (J. Nucl. Mater. 273 (1999) 1). Unfortunately, there are nuclear reactions generated by neutrons that will breed tritium and helium in the material bulk (J. Nucl. Mater. 179 (1991) 329). This process will lead to a substantial tritium inventory in the bulk of the beryllium after long-term neutron exposure (i.e. well beyond the operation life time of a next-step reactor like ITER). Tungsten is a high-Z material that will be used in the divertor region of next-step devices (e.g. ITER) and possibly as a first wall material in later devices. The divertor is the preferred location for tungsten use because net erosion is very low there due to low sputtering and high redeposition. While experiments are still continuing on tritium retention in tungsten, present data suggest that relatively low tritium inventories will result with this material (J. Nucl. Mater. 290-293 (2001) 505). For tritium inventories, carbon is the problem material. Neutron damage to the graphite can result in substantial bulk tritium retention (J. Nucl. Mater. 191-194 (1992) 368), and codeposition of the sputtered carbon with the tritium from the plasma will produce a layer of carbonaceous material potentially containing kilograms of tritium in the cooler areas of the tokamak (J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A5 (1987) 2286). This paper reviews the tritium retention mechanisms for the three materials discussed above.

Four catalyst-packing combinations from different manufacturers (SCK-CEN Belgium, Mendeleev University Russia, Institute of Cryogenics and Isotopic Technologies (ICIT) Romania-TLK, Showa Eng. Japan) are currently being tested. Experiments have been performed to determine the height equivalent of theoretical plate (HETP) and the mass transfer coefficients during deuterium, tritium or simultaneous deuterium and tritium exchange between deuteriated and tritiated water and gaseous hydrogen. isotopes. In the simultaneously tritium and deuterium transfer experiments, both the transfer of tritium and deuterium from liquid to gas and the transfer of tritium from liquid to gas and deuterium in the opposite direction from gas to liquid was investigated.

In the decomposition-processing vessel, tritiated compounds are decomposed so that it is possible to extract the tritium in the form of hydrogen molecules while other elements such as carbon are fixed within the vessel. In our computer simulation of the removal of tritium, a single run of processing was assumed to handle 1 N m(3) of a gaseous mixture that contained 1 GBq tritium and was 90% hydrogen, 5% methane and 5% helium. As a result, three pressure curves, one for hydrogen, a 'both-sum' (hydrogen + methane) curve and a 'total-sum' (hydrogen + methane + helium) curve, showed strong and marked changes in trend at almost the same elapsed time. This time corresponded to the completion of a single cycle of processing. The changes in trend suggest that the three curves had been dominated in the first cycle by the hydrogen initially contained in the exhaust gas and that, after one cycle, they had come to be dominated by the remaining methane and by the hydrogen generated by methane decomposition. It took about 8.7 h for the concentration of tritium in the gas being processed to fall below the relevant limit. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The ISS for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), is characterized by its required flexibility for the variability of feed composition, which is not considered in the existing industrial distillation columns, so that the development of evaluation method of dynamic behavior, which is the base for the establishment of ISS control system, is essential as original technology. At the Tritium Process Laboratory in Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (TPL/JAERI), H-D-T cryogenic distillation experiments have been carried out to acquire the systematic data for the design of the ISS for the ITER. The value of height equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP) was estimated to be 5 cm by the results of present experiments and it was adopted in the ITER-ISS design. The in situ, multi-points and reliable high-speed gas analytical system with Laser Raman spectroscopy was successfully demonstrated in the experiment to analyze the hydrogen isotopes of H(2)-HD-HT-D(2)-DT-T(2) within 1 min with the analysis limit of 1000 ppm, which indicates that this system enables fine control of the ISS. The reliability of this system was also proved through its use without any mechanical trouble for more than 2 years. The analysis codes were developed and improved through the experiments, and it was succeeded to simulate the dynamic behavior of the distillation column. Through a series of the ISS experiments at the TPL/JAERI, effective design and effective operation of the ISS became to be possible. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

For a catalyzed D-D system (no tritium removal), the peak dpa rate in candidate structural materials is 25-35% lower than that in an equivalent D-T system with the same fusion power wall loading. The gas production and transmutation rates are about 60% lower. As tritium is removed gas production and transmutations decrease by more than two orders of magnitude and the dpa rate decreases by a factor of 2.3-2.8. An additional reduction of a factor of 1.6-1.7 in damage parameters is achieved by recycling the removed tritium as He-3. This results in significant lifetime enhancement of structural materials. Information from tests in fission reactor spectra would be directly relevant in determining the lifetime of the structural material in this He-3-recycled system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Besides the gases from other operational modes of the tokamak, such as deuterium or helium from glow discharge cleaning or the fluids from the retrieval of tritium from co-deposits, various other sources within ITER will generate tritiated waste gases which have to be processed. Since ITER does not have a dedicated system for the treatment of gaseous wastes, all the tritium needs to be recovered by the tokamak exhaust processing (TEP) system. Consequently the TEP system has many more duties than the name of this particular part of the ITER tritium plant may suggest. The TEP process is designed to be fully continuous and based on permeation of hydrogen isotopes through palladium/silver (first process step), heterogeneously catalyzed cracking or conversion reactions (second process step), and counter-current isotopic swamping (third process step). The overall decontamination factor of the three-stage TEP process for tritium removal from tokamak exhaust gas at a composition as specified for the DT phase of ITER is at least 10(8). Off-gases from this system can therefore be stacked via the normal vent detritiation system (N-VDS) of ITER after intermittent storage for decay of gamma-active species in dedicated tanks.

Being radioactive, tritium is a health, safety and environment concern. Room air tritium clean systems can be used to handle tritium that has been lost to the room from primary or secondary containment. Such a system called the Experimental Tritium Cleanup (ETC) systems is installed at the Tritium Systems Test Assembly (TSTA) at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The ETC consists of (1) two compressors which draw air from the room, (2) a catalyst bed for conversion of tritium to tritiated water, and (3) molecular sieve beds for collection of the water. The exhaust from this system can be returned to the room or vented to the stack. As part of the US-Japan fusion collaboration, on two separate occasions, tritium was released into the 3000 m(3) TSTA test cell, and the ETC was used to handle these releases. Each release consisted of about one Curie of tritium. Tritium concentrations in the room were monitored at numerous locations. Also recorded were the HT and HTO concentrations at the inlet and outlet of the catalyst bed. Tritium surface concentrations in the test cell were measured before and at a series of times after the releases. Surfaces included normal test cell equipment as well as idealized test specimens. The results showed that the tritium became well-mixed in the test cell after about 45 min. When the ETC was turned on, the tritium in the TSTA test cell decreased exponentially as was expected. The test cell air tritium concentration was reduced to below one DAC (derived air concentration) in about 260 min. For the catalyst bed, at startup when the bed was at ambient temperature, there was little conversion of tritium to HTO. However, once the bed warmed to about 420 K, all of the tritium that entered the bed was converted to HTO. Immediately after the experiment, surfaces in the room initially showed moderately elevated tritium concentrations. However, with normal ventilation, these concentrations soon returned to routine levels. The data collected and reported here should be useful for planning for the operation of existing and future tritium facilities. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

However, it is difficult to measure the amount of tritium on the surface of materials such as tritium gas cylinder or pipes and reaction vessels in a tritium handling system. In this study, several experiments were performed applying the isotope exchange reaction between water vapor in the gas phase and tritium in the surface water to estimate the amount of tritium on the inner surface of used tritium gas cylinder made with aluminum alloy, and the results obtained from these experiments were compared with result of the smear method. Observed value for the amount of tritium on the surface of the aluminum alloy was similar to the value estimated using the trapping capacity of water on aluminum obtained by our previous experimental results. It is confirmed that injection of a little amount of water is possible to extract all tritium on the cylinder inner surface. The smear method could not give quantitatively reliable results for measuring the amount of tritium on the surface. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The removal rate of the codeposits was about 3 mum/h near the surface and 0.9 mum/h in the deeper region. Total amount of tritium released from the cube during 10 h baking was 202 MBq, while remaining tritium in the cube after baking was 403 MBq. Thus 10 h baking at 240 degreesC with 933 Pa O(2) removed 1/3 of tritium from the cube. After 10 h baking, the tritium concentration on the cube surface also dropped by about 1/3. In addition, some tritium was released from another cube of the tile during baking at 240 degreesC in pure Ar, and a rapid increase of tritium release was observed when the purging gas was shifted from pure Ar to Ar-1%O(2). When a whole TFTR tile was baked in air at 350 degreesC for 1 h and then at 500 degreesC for 1 h, the ratios of tritium released were 53 and 47%, respectively. Oxygen reacted with carbon to produce carbon monoxide during baking in air. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In a case of D(2) gas absorption, the amount of retained deuterium was very low, D/C similar to 10(-3) in the atomic ratio of D/C, when the gas pressure was 1 Pa and the temperature 573 K. In a case of the deuterium ion irradiation, the amount of retained deuterium was very similar to the case for graphite. Thus, at a divertor wall temperature higher than 1073 K, the amount of retained deuterium can be regarded negligible small, D/C similar to 0. During the plasma discharge, carbon eroded at a divertor trace by both plasma irradiation and high heat flux co-deposits on the vacuum vessel with fuel hydrogen atoms. In order to estimate the amount of retained fuel hydrogen in the co-deposited carbon dust, D(2) arc discharge with carbon electrodes was conducted and the amount of retained deuterium in the co-deposited dust was measured. In a case that the D(2) gas pressure was approximately 1 Pa and the wall temperature approximately 400 K, the amount of retained deuterium was low, D/C similar to 0.06. Above results showed that fuel hydrogen inventory of the co-deposited carbon dust was largest. In a DT plasma, the corresponding tritium inventory becomes a half, T/C similar to 0.03, which is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than the value estimated so far.

The specific purpose and requirements of the coatings vary widely, depending on the blanket concept. The efforts on coating development to date have focused primarily on electrically insulating coatings for the self-cooled lithium concepts with a vanadium alloy structure, and the tritium barrier coatings for the water-cooled, Pb-Li (WCLL) breeder concepts with ferritic steel structures. Although other coating materials are under consideration, most of the effort on the electrically insulating coatings has focused on CaO and AIN coatings on V-4Cr-4Ti alloy structure. Most of the effort on the tritium barrier coating development is focused on Al(2)O(3) coatings formed on aluminized ferritic steels.

The protium ions or deuterium ions were implanted into SiC at room temperature up to almost the saturation. Successively, the ion source was switched to deuterium ions or protium ions and the samples were irradiated at the same fluence under the same experimental conditions, respectively. The mass balance equations were applied to analyze the retention curves and the curves of decay and uptake in the isotope replacement. The saturation concentrations of H and D have been found to be about 0.70 and 0.75, respectively. The detrapping cross sections of H and D implants by the D-2(+) and H-2(+) ion bombardments have been determined to be 3.2 +/- 0.3 x 10(-22) m(2)/ D+ and 2.6 +/- 0.2 x 10(-22) m(2)/H+ , respectively. The magnitude of these detrapping cross sections from SiC is as large as that from graphite. These isotope differences are discussed in terms of the elementary processes included in the mass balance equations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

To optimise the design, a reliable prediction of swelling due to helium bubbles and of tritium inventory during normal and off-normal operation of a fusion power reactor is needed. The ANFIBE code (ANalysis of Fusion Irradiated BEryllium) is being developed to meet this need. The code has to be applied in a range of irradiation conditions where no experimental data are available, therefore a detailed gas kinetics model, and a specific and particularly careful validation strategy are needed. The validation procedure of the first version of the code was based on macroscopic data of swelling and tritium release. This approach is, however, incomplete, since a verification of the microscopic behaviour of the gas in the metal is necessary to obtain a reliable description of swelling. This paper discusses a general strategy for a thorough validation of the gas kinetics models in ANFIBE. The microstructure characterisation of weakly irradiated beryllium pebbles, with different visual examination techniques, is then presented as an example of the application of this strategy. In particular, the advantage of developing 3D techniques, such as X-ray microtomography, is demonstrated. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

When the iron was irradiated with electron or photon, water and hydrogen molecules were desorbed. Desorption behavior of water and hydrogen molecules depended on the incident energy of electron or photon. We discussed desorption mechanism of water and hydrogen molecules by electron or photon irradiation. It was found that the electronic excitation process contributes to desorption. Based on these results, tritium decontamination by ESD and PSD was evaluated. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

H/D isotopic exchange experiments were conducted to select a Flibe-facing material. Because of hydrogen isotope interactions with carbon, Ni crucibles were selected for Flibe/tritium behavior experiments. A Flibe-tritium pot with two Ni (or Cu) permeable probes was designed. The rate of the overall tritium permeation through the Flibe-facing Ni or Cu was estimated by numerical simulation using TMAP4 code. Diffusion in bulk Flibe was found to be the rate-determining step for purified Flibe. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Austin, SM; Rau, EH; Holcomb, WF; Zoon, RA				Austin, SM; Rau, EH; Holcomb, WF; Zoon, RA			Reduction in radioactive material use and waste generation at the National Institute's of Health	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topic; waste disposal; waste management; regulations		The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has implemented an enhanced and comprehensive program to reduce the rise of radioactive materials and to minimize the generation of radioactive and mixed wastes. The primary drivers for this program were increasing waste management costs, difficulties in disposing of certain types of radioactive wastes, particularly mixed wastes, and the increasing burden of managing radioactive materials in accordance with new regulatory requirements. These minimization efforts, coupled with the development of new on-site waste treatment options and the use of commercially available waste processing facilities, have resulted in significant reductions in the use of radioactive materials in bench research and the resultant amounts of radioactive and mixed waste generated and disposed off-site. A survey of users of radioactive materials was conducted to examine the reasons for this reduction and to predict future ordering trends. The primary factors contributing to reductions in ordering appear to be rapidly increasing use or non-radioactive research techniques, and increasingly burdensome safety and security regulations governing the use of radioactive material, which tend to discourage their use. The downward trends in use and disposal of radioactive materials at the NIH appear to be continuing.

We evaluated a Clinac 2100 CID at 18 MV photon mode for radionuclidic exposure, contamination, and airborne potential to the accelerator staff entering the room after patient radiation treatment. The gantry, patient couch, wedges, floor, and air were activated. Most activated components appear to decay with a half-life of 2.5 min, except the gantry and port with half-lives approaching 10 min. The highest exposure was from the port at <2 mR h(-1). No removable contamination on any activated component was detected including coolant water in the machine. Airborne radionuclides were measured in the room and at the roof exhaust. The airborne potential is short lived because of ventilation and decay with the highest exposure of 0.3 mR h(-1) lasting for 1 s. Our measurements support the insignificant exposures received by accelerator staff wearing whole body personnel monitors. Accelerator roof effluents to unrestricted areas during patient treatments indicate that regulatory limits are not exceeded.

J	Friedman, MI; Ghesani, M				Friedman, MI; Ghesani, M			Interactive software automates personalized radiation safety plans for (NaI)-I-131 therapy	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topic; radiation, medical; radiopharmaceuticals; safety standards	RECEIVING I-131 THERAPY; THYROID REMNANTS; DOSE RATES; DOSIMETRY; RADIOIODINE; CARCINOMA; RELEASE; CODE	NRC regulations have liberalized the criteria for release from control of patients administered radioactive materials but require written radiation safety instruction if another individual is expected to receive more than I mSv. This necessitates calculation or expected doses, even when the calculated maximum likely dose is well below the 5 mSv release criterion. NRC interpretations or the regulation provide the biokinetic model to be used to evaluate the release criterion for patients administered No 1311, but do not provide guidance as to either the specifics of minimizing the dose of others or the length of time restrictions should remain in effect. Interactive software has been developed to facilitate creation of radiation safety plans tailored to patients' expected interactions. Day-by-day and cumulative effective exposures at several separation distances, including sleeping, are presented in grid format in a graphic interface. In an interview session, the patient proposes daily contacts, which are entered separately for each individual by point-and click operation. Total dose estimates are accumulated and modified while negotiating contact schedules, guided by suggested age-specific limits. The software produces printed radiation safety recommendations specific to the clinical, dosing, and social situations and reflective of the patient's choice of combinations of close contact with others. It has been used in treating more than 100 patients and has been found to be very useful and well received.

Materials and methods: NIH3T3 murine cells transfected with mutant p53 constructs were examined for the influence of pentoxifylline on radiotoxicity to Co-60 gamma-irradiation by colony assay. DNA repair (0-100 Gy) was measured by constant-field gel electrophoresis. Apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry with the an nexin-V-binding assay. Results: In the two p53 hot-spot mutant cell lines p53-S269R and p53- + 15, the SF10 radiotoxicity enhancement factors induced by the pentoxifylline were 8.0 and 9.7, respectively. In the 1:63 deletion mutant p53-DeltaA cell line, the radiotoxicity enhancement factor was 2.6. No radiosensitization was obtained in the untransfected p53 wild-type cell line U-Wt and in the transfected p53 double-wild-type p53-Wt cell line. When pentoxifylline was added after irradiation at the time of maximum G2 block expression, no radiosensitization was observed in any of the five cell lines. Constant-field gel electrophoresis analyses after 20 h of repair showed that pentoxifylline suppresses DNA double-strand break repair in all p53 mutant cell lines, as indicated by repair inhibition factors of 2.0-2.3. No repair suppression was found in the p53 wild-type cell lines. Conclusions: p53 mutations are a general requirement for radiosensitization by pentoxifylline and the level of radiosensitization depends upon the location of the p53 mutation.

Sinteractive thoria (crystallite size 6-20 nm) obtained from the de-agglomerated thorium oxalate was characterised for residual carbon, crystallite size, specific surface area, particle size distribution and bulk density. Microstructure of the precursor and the product was studied using TEM and HRTEM. The morphology of the sintered pellets was studied using SEM. The reactivity of the calcined powders was determined by measuring the density of the sintered compacts. The solvent used for de-agglomeration was found to have significant influence on the microstructure of the powders. Thoria derived through aqueous precipitation route could be sintered to a density of 9.7 Mg m(-3) at 1673 K. It was demonstrated that ultrasonic de-agglomeration could be a useful method for obtaining sinteractive thoria. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Literature on the high temperature properties of this compound is not available and there is no report at all on the thermal conductivity of these compounds. Hence a study of thermal conductivity of this compound has been taken up. The compounds were synthesized by a solution combustion method using metal nitrates and urea. Thermal diffusivity of these compounds was measured by the laser flash method in the temperature range 673-1373 K. The specific heat data was computed using Neumann-Kopp's law. Thermal conductivity was calculated using the measured thermal diffusivity value, density and specific heat data for different temperatures. The temperature dependence of thermal conductivity and the implication of structural aspects of these compounds on the data are discussed here. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The results are found to follow an Arrhenius relationship in the temperature range 573-873 K and are compared to the prediction of a kinetic model for the release of hydrogen from metals. The data are lower than would be predicted by the model for an atomically clean surface, but lower than predicted recombination rates are ubiquitous with this type of measurement and well known to result from surface contamination, which reduces surface-site availability and gives rise to variations in the surface chemisorption potential.

Hot vacuum extraction enables complete removal of the hydrogen isotopes from the sample. The isotope dilution technique is used to determine quantitatively the amount of hydrogen isotopes in the extracted gas. Methods for preparing standards of H, D or H and D in Zr-2.5Nb have also been established. These 'in-house' standards are used to assess the performance of the analysis method. The analysis uncertainty, based on the determined content relative to the dosed H or D isotope content of each standard, is 1% (at a level of confidence of 95%) for samples containing greater than similar to5 mumoles H or D. The uncertainty increases to 5% as the sample content decreases to 0.5 mumoles H or D. The uncertainty of this analysis method is well within the requirements for surveillance examinations of CANDU(R) reactors and post-irradiation examinations of reactor components.

J	Lewis, BJ; Szpunar, B; Iglesias, FC				Lewis, BJ; Szpunar, B; Iglesias, FC			Fuel oxidation and thermal conductivity model for operating defective fuel rods	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							FISSION-PRODUCT RELEASE; UO2 OXIDATION; NUCLEAR-FUEL; ELEMENTS; BEHAVIOR	A model has been developed to describe the fuel oxidation behaviour, and its influence on the fuel thermal conductivity, in operating defective nuclear fuel rods. The fuel-oxidation model is derived from adsorption theory and considers the influence of the high-pressure environment that results from coolant entry into the fuel-to-clad gap. This model is in agreement with the fuel-oxidation kinetics observed in high-temperature annealing experiments conducted at 1473-1623 K in steam over a range of pressure from 0.001 to 0.1 MPa. Using a Freundlich adsorption isotherm, the current model is also consistent with recent experiments conducted at a higher pressure of 7 MPa. The model also considers radiolytic effects as a consequence of fission fragment bombardment in the fuel-to-clad gap. This treatment suggests that radiolysis-assisted oxidation is insignificant in operating defective rods (as compared to thermal effects), as supported by limited in-reactor data. The effects of diffusion of the interstitial oxygen ions in the solid in the operating rod is further discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Knight, TW; Anghaie, S				Knight, TW; Anghaie, S			Processing and fabrication of mixed uranium/refractory metal carbide fuels with liquid-phase sintering	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article								Optimization of powder processing techniques were sought for the fabrication of single-phase, solid-solution mixed uranium/refractory metal carbide nuclear fuels - namely (U, Zr, Nb)C. These advanced, ultra-high temperature nuclear fuels have great potential for improved performance over graphite matrix, dispersed fuels tested in the Rover/NERVA program of the 1960s and early 1970s. Hypostoichiometric fuel samples with carbon-to-metal ratios of 0.98, uranium metal mole fractions of 5% and 10%, and porosities less than 5% were fabricated. These qualities should provide for the longest life and highest performance capability for these fuels. Study and optimization of processing methods were necessary to provide the quality assurance of samples for meaningful testing and assessment of performance for nuclear thermal propulsion applications. The processing parameters and benefits of enhanced sintering by uranium carbide liquid-phase sintering were established for the rapid and effective consolidation and formation of a solid-solution mixed carbide nuclear fuel.

J	Tabasso, A; Counsell, GF; Hole, D; Coad, JP				Tabasso, A; Counsell, GF; Hole, D; Coad, JP			Observations of hydrocarbon film deposition in the MAST tokamak	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article								Two divertor tiles from the Mega-Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST) were analysed using interference fringe analysis, nuclear reaction analysis and Rutherford backscattering analysis. The analysis allowed the quantification of the co-deposited layers thickness of the deuterium and carbon mixture and the detection of the presence of other impurities such as oxygen and iron. A layer thickness varying from 10 to 270 nm was measured with a typical D/ (D + C) ratio of approximate to0.36. During the same campaign in which the analysed divertor tiles were exposed to the plasma, the ion flux to the divertor plates has been measured by a set of Langmuir probes mounted on the divertor ribs. This paper shows that the sputtering co-efficient that can be inferred from the ion fluences measured by the probes and by the redeposition of C in those amorphous layers is consistent with physical and chemical sputtering yields in conventional tokamaks. This paper reports the beginning and the intended developments of a project undertaken in MAST to study and quantify the phenomena of plasma surface interaction both at the walls and at the divertor of the machine in order to contribute to the material choice and design of the plasma facing components of a next step device such as ITER.

J	Takeshita, K; Nakano, Y; Shimizu, M; Fuji, Y				Takeshita, K; Nakano, Y; Shimizu, M; Fuji, Y			Recovery of C-14 from graphite moderator of gas-cooled reactor (GCR)	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						decommissioning; graphite; GCR type reactors; carbon 14; recovery; isotope separation; chemical exchange; environmental protection; process design; continuous process; batch process; moderators		The chemical exchange method of carbon isotopes between CO2 and carbamate was applied to the recovery of C-14 from 1,600 t graphite moderator of a gas-cooled reactor (GCR), Tokai-1, and the dimensions of C-14-enrichment process were evaluated numerically. Applicability of two processes with different operation modes, continuous process and batch process, was discussed under the conditions that the concentration of (CO2)-C-14 in the stripped flow corresponding to 99% of feed CO2 is less than the environmental standard. For the continuous process using 2 mol/l diethylamine (DEA)-octane solution as a working fluid at -20degreesC and 0.2 MPa, the column dimensions were evaluated as 3.2 m in diameter and 5.7 in in height in the case of operating period of 20 yr. For the batch process using 4 mol/l DEA-octane solution, the column dimensions were comparable to those of continuous process, when the process was operated at the rate of 4 batch/month under the conditions of -20degreesC and 0.3 MPa. From these results, it is concluded that the CO2/carbamate exchange method is applicable to the recovery of C-14 from irradiated graphite. However, the batch process has serious disadvantages, such as large energy consumption to maintain the top reservoir at low temperature and the generation of a large quantity of secondary wastes. At the present stage, the continuous process should be selected for the practical process design.
