Mayak worker dosimetry study: An overview	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article							EXTRAPULMONARY ORGAN DISTRIBUTION; PRODUCTION-ASSOCIATION; PLUTONIUM WORKERS; TECHA RIVER; CHRONIC INHALATION; HEALTH; MODEL; EXCRETION; RECONSTRUCTION; CONTAMINATION	The Mayak Production Association (MPA) was the first plutonium production plant in the former Soviet Union. Workers at the MPA were exposed to relatively large internal radiation intakes and external radiation exposures, particularly in the early years of plant operations. This paper describes the updated dosimetry database, "Doses-2005." Doses-2005 represents a significant improvement in the determination of absorbed organ dose from external radiation and plutonium intake for the original cohort of 18,831 Mayak workers. The methods of dose reconstruction of absorbed organ doses from external radiation uses: 1) archive records of measured dose and worker exposure history, 2) measured energy and directional response characteristics of historical Mayak film dosimeters, and 3) calculated dose conversion factors for Mayak Study-defined exposure scenarios using Monte Carlo techniques. The methods of dose reconstruction for plutonium intake uses two revised models developed from empirical data derived from bioassay and autopsy cases and/or updates from prevailing or emerging International Commission on Radiological Protection models. Other sources of potential significant exposure to workers such as medical diagnostic x-rays, ambient onsite external radiation, neutron radiation, intake of airborne effluent, and intake of nuclides other than plutonium were evaluated to determine their impact on the dose estimates.

Uncertainties analysis for the plutonium dosimetry model, doses-2005, using mayak bioassay data	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article							RESPIRATORY-TRACT MODEL; ICRPS DOSE COEFFICIENTS; EXTRAPULMONARY ORGAN DISTRIBUTION; PRODUCTION-ASSOCIATION; LUNG-CANCER; PARAMETER UNCERTAINTIES; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; INTERNAL DOSIMETRY; NUCLEAR ENTERPRISE; CHRONIC INHALATION	The Doses-2005 model is a combination of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) models modified using data from the Mayak Production Association cohort. Surrogate doses from inhaled plutonium can be assigned to approximately 29% of the Mayak workers using their urine bioassay measurements and other history records. The purpose of this study was to quantify and qualify the uncertainties in the estimates for radiation doses calculated with the Doses-2005 model by using Monte Carlo methods and perturbation theory. The average uncertainty in the yearly dose estimates for most organs was approximately 100% regardless of the transportability classification. The relative source of the uncertainties comes from three main sources: 45% from the urine bioassay measurements, 29% from the Doses-2005 model parameters, and 26% from the reference masses for the organs. The most significant reduction in the overall dose uncertainties would result from improved methods in bioassay measurement with additional improvements generated through further model refinement. Additional uncertainties were determined for dose estimates resulting from changes in the transportability classification and the smoking toggle. A comparison was performed to determine the effect of using the model with data from either urine bioassay or autopsy data; no direct correlation could be established. Analysis of the model using autopsy data and incorporation of results from other research efforts that have utilized plutonium ICRP models could improve the Doses-2005 model and reduce the overall uncertainty in the dose estimates.

J	Acir, A; Ubeyli, M				Acir, Adem; Ubeyli, Mustafa			Burning of reactor grade plutonium mixed with thorium in a hybrid reactor	JOURNAL OF FUSION ENERGY			English	Article						reactor grade plutonium; thorium; hybrid reactor; fusion; fission	FREE HELICAL REACTOR; SPENT FUEL; NEUTRONIC ANALYSIS; FUSION BREEDER; FISSILE FUEL; OXIDE FUEL; POWER; TRANSMUTATION; BLANKET; PROLIFERATION	Significant amount of plutonium have been discharged and accumulated from the conventional LWRs and CANDU reactors. Reducing this reactor grade (RG) plutonium is very important because it may be misused and/or released accidentally into the environment. Fusion-fission (hybrid) reactors have strong potential on burning plutonium effectively. This study presents the burning of RG plutonium mixed with thorium in a hybrid reactor for an operation period of 24 months. The effect of various fuel mixtures (98% ThO2 + 2% RG-PuO2, 94% ThO2 + 6% RG-PuO2 and 90% ThO2 + 10% RG-PuO2) and coolants (Flinabe, natural lithium and Li20Sn80) on the reactor's performance was investigated. Numerical results showed that utilization of RG plutonium in the mixed fuel in such a hybrid reactor not only enhanced the reactor's performance but also reduced its Pu-239 content significantly.

Studies on the characteristic of titanium-tritium reaction	JOURNAL OF FUSION ENERGY			English	Article						titanium; tritium; thermodynamics; kinetics	HYDROGEN	The p-c-T curves of tritium absorption and desorption of titanium were measured using the method of step equilibrium by stepping up the tritium quantity on an experimental apparatus of metal hydride. The p-c-T curves for tritium have one plateau at temperature below 300 degrees C and two plateaus at temperature above 300 degrees C. The thermodynamic parameters of the different phases were determined according to the van't Hoff equation. The hysteresis effect was not observed in reversible process of tritium absorption and desorption of titanium on our experimental condition. The tritium absorption behavior of titanium in the temperature ranging from 550 degrees C to 750 degrees C and desorption behavior of titanium in the temperature ranging from 350 degrees C to 550 degrees C have been investigated in a constant volume system. A method of the reaction rate analysis was proposed and examined for determining the rate constant. The apparent activation energy obtained by this analysis for the absorption and the desorption were 155.5 +/- a3.2 kJ mol(-1) and 62.1 +/- a1.6 kJ mol(-1) respectively.

The MASCA test shows that the molten corium can be stratified with the metal layer under the oxide when sub-oxidized corium including iron was retained in the lower head of the reactor vessel. This stratification is caused by the increased density of the metal layer attributed to a transfer of uranium metal that was reduced from uranium oxide by zirconium. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations with the database, which was developed for the corium U-Zr-Fe-O-B-C-FPs system using the ionic two-sublattice model for liquid, show quantitative agreements with the MASCA test. such as the composition of each layer, fission product (FP) partitioning between the layers and B4C effect on the stratification.

It is known that ultrasound irradiation to water causes the oxidation and/or reduction of the solute by Ho or OHo. There were some reports on the redox behavior of actinide elements under ultrasound irradiation. Nevertheless, they showed that the ability of ultrasound is not sufficient for the use of the actinide separation processes. However, very recently we found that a noble metal catalyst drastically enhances the sonochemical effect and that even highly stable U(VI) is reduced to U(IV) by ultrasound irradiation. Employing this catalytic reaction, we are developing low-emission actinide ion separation schemes driven by external ultrasound irradiation. In the present work, U(VI), Np(VI) and Pu(VI) in 3 M HNO3 medium were chosen as target ions. Their valency was first adjusted to U(VI)/Np(V)/Pu(IV) by external ultrasound irradiation and, then, further sonochemical reduction to U(IV)/Np(IV)/Pu(III) was carried out. The present results confirmed the possibility to design the low-emission U/Np/Pu Mutual separation scheme driven by external ultrasound irradiation.

In the perchlorate and organic acid solutions, a redox reaction of UO22+/UO2+ and an oxidation reaction of U(TV) produced by a disproportionation Of UO2+ were observed. The peak potentials of the UO22+ reduction showed a good linear relationship with the stability constants of 1:1 UO22+-organic complexes. In the presence of malonic acid, the redox potential for UO22+/UO2+ was constant at pH 1-2 and 5-6 while it decreased with an increase in pH from 2 to 5. Additionally, it was independent of inalonate concentration at 0.1-0.5 M while it decreased with an increase in the concentration from 0.005 to 0.1 M. Based on the experimental and the speciation calculation results, we determined the redox reactions Of UO22+-malonate complexes as a function of pH and malonate concentration. We also determined the redox reactions Of UO22+-oxalate complexes in the same way.

Study of natural radionuclides and its radiation hazard index in Malaysian building materials	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							RADON EXHALATION; RADIOACTIVITY	The main component of most building materials in Malaysia is rock. All rocks are known to contain natural radionuclides such as(238)U and Th-232 series as well as K-40. In order to estimate the radiological impact to the dweller, the level of radionuclides present in various building materials available in Malaysia were analyzed using gamma-spectrometry. The radiation hazard indexes were calculated based on the above results. The results showed that the activity concentration of natural radionculides(238)U, Th-232,K-40 was between 19.0-42.2 Bq/kg, 16.5-28.8 Bq/kg and 243.3-614.2 Bq/kg, respectively. On the whole, the radionuclides concentration was still below the global average of 50 Bq/kg, 50 Bq/kg and 500 Bq/kg for U-238, Th-232, and K-40, respectively The radiation hazard indexes of the building materials were also lower than the maximum value suggested.

Adsorption of hexavalent uranium on biomass by-product	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							HEAVY-METALS; REMOVAL; EQUILIBRIUM; WASTE	The effectiveness of the uranium removal by olive cake from aqueous solutions has been demonstrated in batch type experiments under normal atmospheric conditions. The adsorption capacity has been evaluated by using both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The optimum pH regarding for uranium adsorption on olive cake is 7.5. The amount of adsorbed uranium is governed by the amount of active sites on the biomass surface indicating an inner sphere complexation. The adsorption of uranium on olive cake is an endothermic and entropy-driven process and does not depend on the ionic strength of the solution.

K-40 activities and potassium concentrations in tobacco samples of Mexican cigarettes	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							NEUTRON-ACTIVATION ANALYSIS; RADIOCESIUM; ELEMENTS	Nine brands of tobacco cigarettes manufactured and distributed in the Mexican market were analyzed by gamma-spectrometry to certify their non-artificial radioactive contamination. Since natural occurring radioactive materials (NORM) K-40, Th-232, U-235, and U-239 (and decay products from the latter three nuclides) are the main sources for human radiation exposure, the aim of this work was to determine the activity of K-40 and potassium concentration. Averages of (40)supercript stopK and potassium concentration were of 1.29 +/- 0.18 Bq center dot g(1), and 4.0 +/- 0.57%. The annual dose equivalents to the whole body from ingestion and inhalation of 26 Bq K-40 were 0.23 mu Sv and 15.8 mu Sv, respectively. The corresponding 50 years committed dose equivalents was 0.23 mu Sv. The total committed dose to the lungs due to inhalation of K-40 in tobacco was 16 mu Sv. Potassium concentrations obtained in this work were in the same range of those obtained by INAA, so showing that the used technique is acute, reproducible, and accessible to laboratories equipped with low background scintillation detectors.

A standard material NIST-981 was used to monitor accuracy and to correct mass fractionation. The calculated enrichment factors of lead (taking rubidium as a conservative endogenous element) show its anthropogenic origin with percentages higher than 97.65%.Pb-206/Pb-207 ratio in dry deposit samples ranges from 0.816 to a maximum of 1.154, following a normal distribution. Arithmetic mean was 0.9967 +/- 0.0864 lower than those of possible pollution sources: 1.1395 +/- 0.0165 for gasoline, 1.071 +/- 0.008 for industrially derived lead and, for the more radiogenic natural soil and urban dust values ranging from 1.2082 +/- 0.022 to 1.211 +/- 0.108.

Labeling of a bifunctional monophosphinic acid DOTA analogue with In-111: Radiochemical aspects and preclinical results	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							COMPLEXES	The complex formation of the bifunctional monophosphinic acid DOTA analogue DO3AP(ABn)(1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-4,7,10-triacetic-1-{methyl[(4-aminophenyl)methyl] phosphinic acid}) with(111)In at a tracer level was analyzed. Formation of a complex between In-111 and DO3AP(ABn) was very rapid even at room temperature and high radiolabeling yields were achieved. As introducing the methylphosphinic acid arm to the DOTA structure generated a chiral centre, more than one peak (probably corresponding to various diastereoisomers) of In-111-DO3AP(ABn) were separated on HPLC. Four peaks were separated by HPLC, they probably correspond to four diastereoisomers of In-111-DO3AP(ABn) originating from combination of chirality of complexes of DOTA-like ligands with chirality of coordinated phosphorus atom. Studies in rats showed rapid elimination of radioactivity from the blood and other organs and tissues. The results indicate that DO3AP(ABn) represents a promising ligand for radiolabeling of target-specific biomolecules with radiometals.

Radiolabeling of the peptide is simple and high radiolabeling yields were achieved. The agent was stable in in vivo conditions, the radioactivity eliminated by urine was nearly completely in the parent form. The affinity of In-111-DOTA-Tyr(3)-octreotate to somatostatin receptor-rich organs was substantially higher than that of commercially available In-111-DTPA-octreotide (OctreoScan). The study confirmed high in vivo affinity of the peptide to somatostatin receptors and revealed that receptor binding alters both distribution profile and elimination pathways of the agent in preclinical experiments.

Consequences of external irradiation on the chemical durability of the beta-thorium phosphate-diphosphate during leaching tests	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							LOW-TEMPERATURE PRECURSORS; SOLID-SOLUTIONS; DEFECT PRODUCTION; CERAMICS; THORIUM-URANIUM(IV); AMORPHIZATION; DISSOLUTION	The effect of external irradiation on beta-thorium phosphate-diphosphate (tetravalent actini des bearing storage matrix) and the influence on its dissolution in aqueous media were studied. Highly energetic heavy ions were used to get the amorphization of the crystalline structure of the ceramic. The ex-situ dissolution expenments showed an increase of the dissolution versus amorphous fraction in several pH and temperature conditions. The in-situ dissolution experiments highlighted the primordial importance of radiolytic produced free radical species. From these results, the ceramic presents a good resistance to aqueous alteration even in amorphous state.

Industrial production and purification of P-32 by sulfur irradiation with partially moderated neutron fluxes and target melting	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								Target purification of S-alpha is carried out by distillation at 444 +/- 2 degrees C under N atmosphere and diluting the vapors in CS2. The solution is filtered through fiberglass, Teflon and cellulose to obtain S-alpha by CS2 evaporation. Once 30 g of this target are irradiated with fast neutron fluxes from 4.5 to 7.4 center dot 10(12) n(.)cm (2.)s (1) from 6 to 12 hours, the nuclear reaction S-32(n,p)P-32 takes place. So, the irradiated S-alpha sample is placed in a Pyrex container situated inside a furnace as the most important piece of equipment in one aluminum and Lucite glove box. The distillation of irradiated sulfur takes place at 444 +/- 2 degrees C under N atmosphere during 1-2 hours. The vapors are connected to a sulfur diluter containing 20% CS2 aqueous solution, followed by an activated carbon filter and the two similar additional sulfur diluters. Once cooled, the distillation chamber keeps the radioactive, carrier-free P-32 stuck to the wall. Then 25-50 ml of 0.1N HCl acid was injected by suction and heated again at 110 +/- 2 degrees C during 1 hour. The corresponding chemical reaction takes place and the labeled (H3PO4)-P-32 solution is produced. In such a way, industrial production of P-32 labeled molecules has started in Mexico, with an initial production of 3700-5550 MBq per week.

The siderophore desferrioxamine B (DFO) has hydroxamate functional groups, similar to acetohydroxamic acid (AHA), a ligand that is proposed for actinide complexation in advanced separations. In the proposed separation involving AHA, the exact role of the complex in the extraction behavior of actinides is unclear DFO can be used to clarify the role of AHA if the fundamental interactions of DFO with actinides are determined Experiments with uranyl are performed from pH 3.5 to pH 10 showing three complexes.

Actinide speciation in the environment	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Nuclear Chemistry Congress (1st-INCC)	MAY 22-29, 2005	Kusadasi, TURKEY				METAL CARBONATE EQUILIBRIA; COMMON MINERAL SURFACES; OXIDATION-STATES; NATURAL-WATERS; SEAWATER; PLUTONIUM; CHEMISTRY; SYSTEM; SOLUBILITY; ISOTOPES	Nuclear test explosions and nuclear reactor wastes and accidents have released large amounts of radioactivity into the environment. Actinide ions in waters often are not in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium and their solubility and migration behavior is related to the form in which the nuclides are introduced into the aquatic system. Chemical speciation, oxidation state, redox reactions, and sorption characteristics are necessary in predicting solubility of the different actinides, their migration behaviors and their potential effects on marine biota. The most significant of these variables is the oxidation state of the metal ion as the simultaneous presence of more than one oxidation state for some actinides in a solution complicates actinide environmental behavior. Both Np(V)O-2(+) and Pu(V)O-2(+) , the most significant soluble states in natural oxic waters, are relatively noncomplexing and resistant to hydrolysis and subsequent precipitation. The solubility of NpO2+ can be as high as 10 (4) M while that of PuO2+ is much more limited by reduction to the insoluble tetravalent species, Pu(OH)(4), (pK(sp)>= 56) but which can be present in the pentavalent form in aqautic phases as colloidal material. The solubility of hexavalent UO22+ stop in sea water is relatively high due to formation of carbonate complexes. The insoluble trivalent americium hydroxocarbonate, Am(OH)(CO3) is the limiting species for the solubility of Am(III) in sea water. Thorium(IV) is present as Th(OH)(4), in colloidal form. The chemistry of actinide ions in the environment is reviewed to show the spectrum of reactions that can occur in natural waters which must be considered in assessing the environmental behavior of actinides. Much is understood about sorption of actinides on surfaces, the mode of migration of actinides in such waters and the potential effects of these radioactive species on marine biota, but much more understanding of the behavior of the actinides in the environment is needed to allow proper and reliable modeling needed for disposition of nuclear waste over many thousands of years.

Results obtained by gamma-spectrometry, UV-visible spectrophotometry and gravimetry have been compared. It was observed that the results obtained by gamma-spectrometric and gravimetric methods were in good agreement and consequently they gave similar deviation error values, whereas the error values for UV-spectrophotometric method were higher than these values. As a conclusion, gamma-spectrometric method was found to be more suitable for analysis of uranium in solid and aqueous phases and may be preferred over the UV-spectrophotometric method.

Study of the effect of uranium and thorium on the growing of pepper (Capsicum annuum var. longum) and cucumber (Cucumis sativus) plants	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							SOIL; PHYTOREMEDIATION; RADIONUCLIDES; VEGETATION	The transportation rate of uranium and thorium to different plants grown in soils having high level of these elements varies closely with the plant characteristics. In this study, the pepper (Capsicum annuum var. longum) and cucumber (Cucumis sativus) plants were chosen as vegetables which are commonly consumed over different regions by different populations. The results obtained can be summarized as follows. (1) High uranium concentration in the soil prevents the growing of the plants. Only the plants in the pot having the uranium concentration of about 263 ppm grew significantly. The plants in other pots having a higher concentration turned pale and died in a few weeks. (2) In the pot having thorium level of about 263 ppm, the plants were well grown and fruited in comparison to the control plants, but the increase of thorium concentration inversely influenced their growing. (3) The gross activities measured in different parts of the plants were not particularly high, however, in both cases the maximum activities were measured in the stems rather than in the fruits and leaves. (4) The plants grown in soils having thorium content lived longer than the control plants and at the greenhouse conditions indicated above, all plants lived more than one whole year flowering and fruiting.

Determination of Am-241/Am-243 ratios	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							SPECTROMETRY; PLUTONIUM	Determination of Am-241/Am-243 ratios is required for various purposes including assay of Am by isotope dilution techniques. Alpha-spectrometry on electrodeposited sources is a preferred technique for this determination. However, there is an inherent problem of tail contribution which necessitates the use of suitable algorithms to account for the same. Recently, in the frame of a Coordinated Research Program (CRP) of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), WinALPHA software has been developed which is a combination of an asymmetrical Gaussian for the main part of the peak and a low energy function. Therefore, it was of interest to compare the use of this algorithm with the routinely used method, in our laboratory, based on geometric progression (G. P.) decrease. Since, there are no reference materials available commercially for Am-241/Am-243 ratios, synthetic mixtures covering a wide range (0.3 to 2.0) of Am-241/Am-243 alpha-activity ratios were used and un-ignited electrodeposited sources were prepared for alpha-spectrometry. The alpha-spectra obtained using PIPS detector, were evaluated using the two algorithms The Am-241/Am-243 alpha-activity ratios obtained were also compared with those determined by thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS). An agreement of about 1% was obtained in the Am-241/Am-243 ratios determined by the two methods and also by using the two algorithms for alpha-spectrum evaluation.

Determination of Pu-238 in plutonium bearing fuels by thermal ionization mass spectrometry	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ISOTOPE CORRELATIONS; ALPHA-SPECTROMETRY; TIMS	Determination of Pu-238 in plutonium bearing fuels is required as a part of the chemical quality assurance of nuclear fuels. In addition, the determination of Pu-238 is required in nuclear technology for many other applications, e.g., for developing isotope correlations and while using Pu-238 as a spike (tracer) in isotope dilution alpha-spectrometry (IDAS). This determination usually involves the use of alpha-spectrometry on purified Pu sample. In view of the random errors associated with the counting statistics and the systematic errors due to (1) in-growth of Am-241 in purified Pu sample and (2) tail contribution correction methodology in alpha-spectrometry, the precision and accuracy obtainable by alpha-spectrometry are limited. Thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) is generally used for the determination of different Pu isotopes other than Pu-238. This is due to the ubiquitous isobaric interference from U-238 at Pu-238 in TIMS. Recently, we have carried out studies on the formation of atomic and oxide ions of U and Pu by TIMS and developed a novel approach using interfering element correction methodology to account for the isobaric interference of U-238 at Pu-238 in TIMS. This methodology is based on the addition of U-235 (enrichment > 90 atom%) to Pu sample followed by the determination of U-238/U-235 atom ratio using UO+ ion and determination of Pu isotope ratios using Pu+ ion, from the same filament loading. The TIMS methodology was used for the determination of Pu-238 in different Pu samples in U based nuclear fuels from PHWRs with Pu-238 content about 0.2 atom%. The Pu-238 determination was also carried out using alpha-spectrometry. This paper reports the results obtained by the two methods and presents the merits and shortcomings of the two approaches.

Determination of radium isotopes in soil samples by alpha-spectrometry	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ENVIRONMENTAL-SAMPLES; RA-226; RN-222	A sensitive and accurate method for determination of radium isotopes in soil samples by alpha-spectrometry has been developed Ra-225, which is in equilibrium with its mother Th-229, was used as a yield tracer. Radium in soil samples was fused together with Na2CO3 and Na2O2 at 600 degrees C, leached with HNO3, HCl and HF, preconcentrated by coprecipitation with BaSO4, separated from uranium, thorium and iron using a Microthene-TOPO chromatographic column, isolated from barium in a cation-exchange resin column using 0.05M 1,2-cyclohexylene-dinitrilo-tetraacetic acid monohydrate as an eluant, electrodeposited on a stainless steel disc, and counted by alpha-spectrometry. The detection limit of the method is 0.43 Bq(.)kg (1) for Ra-226, Ra-228 and Ra-224 if 0.50 g of soil sample are analyzed. The method was checked with two certified reference materials supplied by the IAEA, and reliable results were obtained Fourteen soil samples collected from the refractory industry in Italy were also analyzed. The mean radiochemical yields for radium were 85.7 +/- 4.3%, and the obtained radium concentrations in the soil samples were in the range of 8.08-3878 Bq(.)kg (1) for Ra-226, of 1.60-678 Bq(.)kg (1) for Ra-228 and 1.25-550 Bq(.)kg (1) for Ra-224, with Ra-228/Ra-226 and Ra-224/Ra-226 ratios ranged from 0.159-0.821 and from 0.142 to 0.525, respectively.

District surveys following the windscale incident, October 1957	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article								During 10-11 October 1957 a fire in the core of a nuclear reactor at Windscale Works, Sellafield ( in the current county of Cumbria, England) led to a significant release of radioactive material to atmosphere. The accident at Windscale No. 1 Pile required a large-scale environmental monitoring programme to be conducted and the results of this survey led to a restriction on the distribution of milk from an area adjacent to Windscale Works for a period of several weeks. This monitoring programme was described in detail by H J Dunster and his colleagues from the Industrial Group of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority ( which operated Windscale Works in 1957) in a paper presented to the Second United Nations International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, held in Geneva during 1-13 September 1958. The paper, from the proceedings of this conference, is reproduced here.

J	Charles, MW				Charles, M. W.			Radon exposure of the skin: I. Biological effects	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Review							ATOMIC-BOMB SURVIVORS; LUNG-CANCER; ALPHA-IRRADIATION; BETA-IRRADIATION; URANIUM MINERS; UNITED-STATES; HAIR CYCLE; MOUSE SKIN; DOSE-RATE; RADIATION	Radon progeny can plate out on skin and give rise to exposure of the superficial epidermis from alpha emitters Po-218 (7.7 MeV, range similar to 66 mu m) and Po-214 ( 6 MeV, range similar to 44 mu m). Dose rates from beta/gamma emitters Pb-214 and Bi-214 are low and only predominate at depths in excess of the alpha range. This paper reviews the evidence for a causal link between exposure from radon and its progeny, and deterministic and stochastic biological effects in human skin. Radiation induced skin effects such as ulceration and dermal atrophy, which require irradiation of the dermis, are ruled out for alpha irradiation from radon progeny because the target cells are considerably deeper than the range of alpha particles. They have not been observed in man or animals. Effects such as erythema and acute epidermal necrosis have been observed in a few cases of very high dose alpha particle exposures in man and after acute high dose exposure in animals from low energy beta radiations with similar depth doses to radon progeny. The required skin surface absorbed doses are in excess of 100 Gy. Such effects would require extremely high levels of radon progeny. They would involve quite exceptional circumstances, way outside the normal range of radon exposures in man. There is no definitive identification of the target cells for skin cancer induction in animals or man. The stem cells in the basal layer which maintain the epidermis are the most plausible contenders for target cells. The majority of these cells are near the end of the range of radon progeny alpha particles, even on the thinnest body sites. The nominal depth of these cells, as recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), is 70 mu m. There is evidence however that some irradiation of the hair follicles and/or the deeper dermis, as well as the inter-follicular epidermis, is also necessary for skin cancer induction. Alpha irradiation of rodent skin that is restricted to the epidermis does not produce skin cancer. Accelerator generated high energy helium and heavy ions can produce skin cancer in rodents at high doses, but only if they penetrate deep into the dermis. The risk figures for radiation induced skin cancer in man recommended by the ICRP in 1990 are based largely on x and beta irradiated cohorts, but few data exist below absorbed doses of about 1 Gy. The only plausible finding of alpha- radiation induced skin cancer in man is restricted to one study in Czech uranium miners. There is no evidence in other uranium miners and the Czech study has a number of shortcomings. This review concludes that the overall balance of evidence is against causality of radon progeny exposure and skin cancer induction. Of particular relevance is the finding in animal studies that radiation exposure of cells which are deeper than the inter-follicular epidermis is necessary to elicit skin cancer. In spite of this conclusion, a follow-on paper evaluates the attributable risk of radon to skin cancer in the UK on the basis that target cells for skin cancer induction are the cells in the basal layer of the inter-follicular epidermis since this is the conservative assumption made by international bodies such as the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) for general radiological protection purposes.

Mortality among residents of Uravan, Colorado who lived near a uranium mill, 1936-84	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article							MATERIALS PROCESSING FACILITIES; KINGDOM CHILDHOOD-CANCER; DRINKING-WATER; LUNG-CANCER; NATURAL RADIONUCLIDES; IONIZING-RADIATION; DOMESTIC SOURCES; CASE-COHORT; RADON; RISK	A cohort mortality study was conducted of all adult residents who ever lived in Uravan, Colorado, a company town built around a uranium mill. Vital status was determined through 2004 and standardised mortality analyses conducted for 1905 men and women alive after 1978 who lived for at least 6 months between 1936 and 1984 in Uravan. Overall, mortality from all causes (standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 0.90) and all cancers (SMR 1.00) was less than or as expected based on US mortality rates. Among the 459 residents who had worked in underground uranium mines, a significant increase in lung cancer was found (SMR 2.00; 95% CI 1.39-2.78). No significant elevation in lung cancer was seen among the 767 female residents of Uravan or the 622 uranium mill workers. No cause of death of a priori interest was significantly increased in any group, i.e. cancers of the kidney, liver, breast, lymphoma or leukaemia or nonmalignant respiratory disease, renal disease or liver disease. This community cohort study revealed a significant excess of lung cancer among males who had been employed as underground miners. We attribute this excess to the historically high levels of radon in uranium mines of the Colorado Plateau, coupled with the heavy use of tobacco products. There was no evidence that environmental radiation exposures above natural background associated with the uranium mill operations increased the risk of cancer. Although the population studied was relatively small, the follow-up was long, extending up to 65 years after first residence in Uravan, and nearly half of the study subjects had died.

Environmental, health and safety assessment of decommissioning radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) in northwest Russia	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article							IONIZING-RADIATION	This paper presents findings from public health and environmental assessment work that has been conducted as part of a joint Norwegian-Russian project to decommission radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG) in northwest Russia. RTGs utilise heat energy from radioactive isotopes, in this case Sr-90 and its daughter nuclide Y-90, to generate electricity as a power source. Different accident scenarios based on the decommissioning process for RTGs are assessed in terms of possible radiation effects to humans and the environment. Doses to humans and biota under the worst-case scenario were lower than threshold limits given in ICRP and IAEA literature.

Hot particle dosimetry and radiobiology - past and present	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Ukaea Conference on Managing Historical Hot Particle Liabilities in the Marine Environment around Dounreay	AUG 30-31, 2005	Nairn, SCOTLAND	UKAEA, Scottish Environm Protect Agcy, British Nuclear Energy Soc, Inst Environm Management & Assessment			BETA-IRRADIATION; SKIN; PROTECTION; RISK	Small high-activity radioactive particles of nominal diameter ranging from similar to 1 mm down to several mu m have been a radiological concern over the last 30 years in and around European and American nuclear reactor facilities. These particles have often been referred to as ' hot particles'. The ' hot particle problem' came into prominent concern in the late 1960s. The potential carcinogenic effects in lungs as the result of irradiation by discrete small particles containing alpha- emitting radionuclides, particularly Pu-239, were claimed by some to be several orders of magnitude greater than those produced by uniform irradiation to the same mean dose. The phrase ' hot particle problem' was subsequently used to refer to the difficulty of predicting health effects for all microscopic radioactive sources. The difficulty arose because of the paucity of comparative human, animal or cell studies using radioactive particles, and the lack of validated measurement or calculational techniques for dose estimation for non- uniform exposures. Experience was largely restricted to uniform, large- area/ volume exposures. The concern regarding cancer induction was extended to deterministic effects when the ICRP in 1977 failed to give adequate dose limits for dealing with 'hot particle' exposures of the skin. Since 1980, considerable efforts have been made to clarify and solve the dosimetric and radiobiological issues related to the health effects of 'hot particle' exposures. The general recommendations of the ICRP in 1991 used the latest radiobiological data to provide skin dose limits which are applicable to 'hot particle' exposures. More recently the NCRP has extended considerations to other organs. This progress is reviewed and applied to the specific case of the recent evaluation of potential health effects of Dounreay fuel fragments commissioned by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency ( SEPA). Analyses of possible doses and risks in this case indicate that the principal concern following skin contact, ingestion or inhalation is the possibility of localised ulceration of skin or of the mucosal lining of the colon or extra- thoracic airways.

J	Crawford, R; Toole, J; Innes, S				Crawford, Ron; Toole, Joe; Innes, Steve			Studies at Dounreay on the repopulation of offshore sediments by hot particles	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th IEEE International Workshop on Object-Oriented Real-Time Dependable Systems	OCT 01-03, 2003	Anacapri, ITALY	IEEE Comp Soc, Tech Comm Distributed Proc, IFIP WG 10 4, OMG, EOARD, Microsoft Corp, Ansaldo Segnalamento Ferroviario, Univ Naples Federico II				Since 2000, much of the effort of diving surveys offshore of Dounreay to locate the presence of radioactive particles in the seabed sediments has been directed to a programme of repopulation studies, in which selected areas of the seabed have been surveyed a number of times and cleared of identified particles on each occasion. This work has led to an understanding of the distribution of particles within the seabed off Dounreay. The two-population model originally proposed by Atkinson ( 2001 UKAEA Document reference 000052) and further refined into three populations by Clayton and Atkinson ( 2002 UKAEA Document PSG Issue Note ( 02) 33) has been substantially confirmed by the extended data set now available. It is apparent that the upper layers of the seabed sediments, containing a population of particles, are essentially mobile. These sediments migrate over the seabed driven by tidal wave and surge induced seabed currents, recontaminating areas which have been previously cleared of particles. The number of particles present in this layer at any given location has not been effectively reduced by the removal of particles over the years, nor has the distribution of activity within this population varied significantly. The highest concentration of particles, and the most active, reside close to and to the northeast of the effluent diffuser outfall. Particle numbers and their activity decrease with distance from the diffuser, and the rate of decrease is significantly greater to the southwest compared to the northeast. By contrast, there is evidence that the population of particles retained in the deeper sediments has changed significantly as a result of the repopulation surveys. Close to the diffuser, the population of particles identified at depth during initial surveys is high and contains significantly more highly active particles than are found in the surface sediments. It is also evident that once the deeper sediments are cleared of particles, the level of repopulation of these sediments over time is substantially reduced. There is little mixing of the more deeply buried sediments.	Jacobs Babtie, Scrabster, England; UKAEA, Dounreay, Scotland	Crawford, R (reprint author), Jacobs Babtie, Scrabster, England.

The experience is from operating a near-continuous monitoring program, for a period of eight years, on beaches near the Dounreay site. The reliability and failure mechanisms of the monitoring systems used will be discussed, together with remedial actions employed. The viability and performance of several types and configurations of radiation detectors will be described, along with methods by which particles might be detected, given their response to buried particles. When large areas are being monitored at high spatial resolution, which is required for efficient particle detection, the volume of data recorded for audit purposes can be very large. The use and abuse of Geographical Information Systems for this work is described. Other practical aspects of performing surveys are also discussed, including understanding health- and-safety requirements; constraints imposed by weather, tides and tidal speed; the logistics of making vehicles available to perform the work; and how a particle should be recovered once detected.

Assumptions are made regarding particle density, distribution, size and bio- availability of the radioactive materials. From this, impacts are assessed against the likelihood of mortality or other significant harm to individuals and interpreted in terms of local populations. Results obtained indicate that no significant impact, at the population level, is likely to be observed. This does not preclude that some individuals will be affected. It does, however, suggest that any decision to remediate, if based predominantly on environmental considerations, should be cognisant of the damage caused by remediation itself and subsequent exploitation of the environment by humans.

Determining a strategy for managing radioactive particles in the environment: establishing the BPEO	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Ukaea Conference on Managing Historical Hot Particle Liabilities in the Marine Environment around Dounreay	AUG 30-31, 2005	Nairn, SCOTLAND	UKAEA, Scottish Environm Protect Agcy, British Nuclear Energy Soc, Inst Environm Management & Assessment				The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) is in the process of identifying the long-term management strategy for radioactive particles in the environment. Application of the standard best practicable environmental option (BPEO) methodology to this issue is, however, complicated because particles reside in both the on-shore and off-shore environments. Methods for implementation of potential management options may vary due to the differing characteristics of the on-and off-shore environments. A different management option may therefore be required, and furthermore the dynamic interaction between these two environments influences how these options could be combined to provide an overall management strategy. UKAEA has developed the standard BPEO appraisal process so that distinct management options for both environments are initially assessed separately. This allows identification of the key issues that influence how they are combined into an overall management strategy. Over the last two years the public consultation on this issue has progressed substantially and therefore the paper presented at the Nairn conference in 2005 has been revised to take into account the work carried out to date.

Past radioactive particle contamination in the Columbia river at the Hanford site, USA	JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th IEEE International Workshop on Object-Oriented Real-Time Dependable Systems	OCT 01-03, 2003	Anacapri, ITALY	IEEE Comp Soc, Tech Comm Distributed Proc, IFIP WG 10 4, OMG, EOARD, Microsoft Corp, Ansaldo Segnalamento Ferroviario, Univ Naples Federico II				One closed-loop and eight single-pass plutonium production reactors originally operated on the Columbia river. During the 26 years of single-pass reactor operations, small amounts of radioactive particles were released in liquid discharges to the Columbia river and were deposited in sediment and cobble along the shoreline and on islands in the river. Islands located adjacent to D island and immediately downstream of D island had the greatest density of particles. In 1979, the small particles contained between 63 and 890 kBq of cobalt-60 activity. Dose rates emanating from those particles ranged from 1 to 14 mu Gy h(-1). Because of the short half-life of cobalt-60 ( 5.3 y), the hotparticle problem at Hanford has taken care of itself through radiological decay. Some scientists have proposed that it is economically and environmentally advantageous to manage isolated low-level contaminated sites with institutional controls until the activity decays and the sites can be released rather than to pursue expensive clean-up options.

This programme has evolved over the years: gradually more intensive monitoring has been required by the site regulator, the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency ( SEPA), while UKAEA have managed the deployment of increasingly more sophisticated radiation detection technology to meet or exceed regulatory expectations. This paper provides an overview of the beach monitoring programmes, and summarises how many particles have been detected, where they have been found, and how radioactive they are. The large number of in situ measurements typically recorded during surveys and the large areas of beach sands monitored are illustrated by reference to survey data acquired in the first half of 2005. Finally, the implications of the detection of a small particle at a large public beach some 23 km east of the Dounreay site are briefly discussed, as is the nature of some future work related to this environmental legacy.

Thermalhydraulics studies examining the feasibility for introducing slightly enriched uranium fuel into the Embalse CANDU reactor	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th International Topical Meeting on Nuclear Reactor Thermal Hydraulics (NURETH-11)	OCT 02-06, 2005	Avignon, FRANCE					A joint study on the technical feasibility of using 0.9% slightly enriched uranium (SEU) fuel in the Embalse CANDU reactor was performed by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) and Nucleoelectrica Argentina S.A. (NASA). The feasibility study focused on the following technical areas: reactor physics and fuel management, fuel performance, and safety. Part of the safety assessment involved detailed thermalhydraulics analyses of three accident scenarios for a full core of SEU fuel bundles: (i) slow loss-of-reactivity control (LORC) event, (ii) large-break loss-of-coolant accident (LBLOCA) with emergency core cooling system (ECCS) available, and (iii) end-fitting failure. Other accident scenarios possibly encountered during the demonstration irradiation exercise or transition core have also been examined. It is concluded that introducing SEU fuel into the Embalse CANDU reactor is feasible. Clear advantages (e.g., fuel cost saving, increase in fuel exit burnup, and reduction in spent fuel volume) have been identified. The reduction in maximum bundle powers and the shift of the maximum bundle-power location to the inlet of the channel for the SEU fuel improve operating and safety margins. These margins are higher with the CANFLEX SEU fuel than the 37-element SEU fuel, due to lower linear powers and improved thermalhydraulic design. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All fights reserved.

We present the electrical characteristics of the fabricated sensors such as the leakage currents and the capacitances as a function of reverse bias voltage. We also discuss results of the radiation damage test with 45 MeV proton beam of a cyclotron in Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Science (KIRAMS) in Seoul, Korea. The leakage currents and the full depletion voltage were measured to be less than 10 nA/strip and about 60 V, respectively. We conclude that developed sensors have an excellent safety margin of radiation hardness appropriate for the ILC. The results of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the fabricated silicon strip sensors with Sr-90 radioactive source and the proton beam of the KIRAMS are also presented. The SNRs of the strip sensor are measured to be 25.0 and 6.7-16.4 for the source test and for the proton beam test, respectively. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Cr, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Ga, Se, Y, Mo, Cd, In, Sn, Te and Ba metals were excited by 59.5 keV gamma-ray from 50 mCi Am-241 radioactive source and the Ta, W and Bi targets were excited by 123.6 keV gamma-ray from 25 mCi Co-57 radioactive source. The characteristic K X-rays emitted by samples were detected by using a super Si(Li) detector having a resolution of 150 eV at 5.9 keV. In addition, the I-K beta/I-K alpha intensity ratios for these metals were studied. The obtained experimental values of the K-shell X-ray fluorescence cross-sections and the I-K beta/I-K alpha intensity ratios have been compared with theoretical values. The measured values were in good agreement with theoretical values. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.

J	Magistris, M				Magistris, M.			The matrix method for radiological characterization of radioactive waste	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						radioactivity; characterization; activation; waste		Beam losses are responsible for material activation in some of the components of particle accelerators. The activation is caused by several nuclear processes and varies with the irradiation history and the characteristics of the material (namely chemical composition and size). Once at the end of their operational lifetime, these materials require radiological characterization. The radionuclide inventory depends on the particle spectrum, the irradiation history and the chemical composition of the material. As long as these factors are known and the material cross-sections are available, the induced radioactivity can be calculated analytically. However, these factors vary widely among different items of waste and sometimes they are only partially known. The European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN, Geneva) has been operating accelerators for high-energy physics for 50 years. Different methods for the evaluation of the radionuclide inventory are currently under investigation at CERN, including the so-called, "matrix method". This paper provides a mathematical formulation of the matrix method highlighting its advantages and limits of validity. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Pa-231 has widespread applications in the earth sciences. It can be used for U-series disequilibrium dating, and Pa-231 is an important tracer in Paleoceanography. The Pa isotopes were measured with the compact ETH/PSI-AMS facility TANDY operating at about 300 kV. The linearity of the AMS is documented with two standard-dilution experiments and first measurements of natural samples from very different climate archives are presented. Our results show that it is possible to determine Pa-231 amounts in the lower fenitogram. (1 fg = 10(-15) g) range with the TANDY. In natural samples, Pa-231 concentrations between 1 and 4 pg/g (I pg = 10(-12) g) were measured with an average total error of 3% (one sigma). The average over all reproducibility of these first measurements was better than 2% with clear potential for improvement. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We then use the relationship between the generalized flux importance and generalized source importance functions to transform the generalized flux importance transport equations into the integrodifferential equations for the generalized adjoints. The resulting adjoint and generalized adjoint transport equations are then solved using the method of cyclic characteristics (MOCC). Because of the presence of negative adjoint sources, a coupled flux biasing/decontamination scheme is applied to make the generalized adjoint functions positive in such a way that it can be used for the multigroup rebalance technique. After convergence is reached, the decontamination procedure extracts from the generalized adjoints the component parallel to the adjoint function. Three types of biasing/decontamination schemes are investigated in the study. To demonstrate the efficiency of our solution algorithms, calculations are performed on 17 x 17 pressurized water reactor and 37-pin Canada deuterium uranium reactor (CANDU) lattices. Numerical comparisons of the generalized adjoint functions and GPT estimates using the MOCC and collision probability method are presented as well as sensitivity coefficients of nuclide densities.

Beryllium layer deposition on carbon and tungsten from beryllium-seeded plasmas	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						deposition; seeded; plasmas; layers	EROSION	The deposition of beryllium (Be) on carbon (C) and tungsten (W) has been studied at the PISCES-B divertor simulator. Samples of C and W were exposed to a deuterium plasma that was seeded with Be from a small effusion cell mounted similar to 120 mm upstream from the sample. The incident and eroded flux of Be from these samples was monitored through visible light spectroscopy. The surface composition and layer thickness were measured using Auger electron spectroscopy and ion beam analysis. Results on the formation of Be layers on C and W focusing on the layer growth rate and thickness as functions of temperature are presented. Modeling calculations of Be layer formation on graphite can explain the equilibrium surface composition, but a prediction of the layer formation rate is hampered by an incomplete model of the influence of surface morphology on chemical erosion of the surface. For Be layer formation on W, the modeling calculations including Be diffusion and sublimation correctly predict the Be uptake into the W surface.

J	Tiliks, J; Kizane, G; Vitin, A; Kolodinska, E				Tiliks, Juris; Kizane, Gunta; Vitin, Aigars; Kolodinska, Elina			Magnetic field effects on tritium release from neutron-irradiated beryllium pebbles	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						irradiated beryllium; pebbles; chemical forms of tritium; tritium release	BLANKET	The effects of temperature, magnetic field (MF), and ionizing radiation on the release of tritium from the Be pebbles irradiated in the BERYLLIUM experiment in 1994 in Petten, The Netherlands (irradiation neutron fluence 1.24 x 10(25) m(-2) irradiation temperature 780 K, and H-3 content 7 appm) were investigated in this study. Simultaneous action of these factors corresponds to the real operating conditions of the blanket of a fusion reactor. The total amount of tritium in a separate pebble, the chemical forms of localized tritium (T-0, T-2, and T+), and the tritium distribution in the pebble volume were determined by a lyomethod (dissolution). Thermoannealing experiments were performed at a constant temperature of 1123 K for 2 h under the following conditions: separately both in MF (1.7 T) and under fast electron radiation (E = 5 Me V; P = 14 MGy center dot h(-1)) as well as under the action of all three factors. Tritium in the Be pebbles is localized for the most part as T-2 (85 to 94%). The abundances of T+ (4 to 5%) and T-0 (5 to 10%) are little. The tritium distribution in a pebble is not uniform; most of the tritium is localized in the inner part of a pebble. An MF of (1.7T) decreases slightly the fractional release of tritium under the given conditions of thermoannealing (from 30 to 25%), the fast electron radiation increases it (from 30 to 40%), but the simultaneous action of the MF and radiation increases it (from 30 to 54%). The effects observed are explained that the MF and radiation affect the concentration of main diffusing particles T-0 in a beryllium matrix.
