J	Laufs, P				Laufs, P.			The development of engineered safeguards for nuclear power plants in the political and technical environment in the Federal Republic of Germany since 1955	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								The safety of nuclear power plants is determined largely by the integrity of the internally pressurized coolant containment system. The highly radioactive materials (fission products) generated within this pressurized containment (primary system) in the reactor core during nuclear power plant operation constitute an extremely great potential hazard. Catastrophic failure of the primary system, and the release into the environment of the radioactive inventory, must be avoided at all costs. Because of the high coolant pressure and the high power density, pressurized water reactors (PWR) impose particularly strict requirements with respect to reactor safety. German nuclear power plants equipped with light water reactors enjoy the reputation of being among the safest plants in the world. This frequent statement is justified in the light of the research and development work performed jointly by industry, government agencies, science, and expert bodies between the 1960s and the 1990s. The research projects, which implied considerable financial expenditures, their internationally acknowledged results, and the resultant additional backfitting measures conducted in German nuclear power plants at many billions of expenditures, were hardly noticed by the German body politic.

J	Allelein, HJ				Allelein, H. -J.			Chemistry in reactor safety research	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								In the realm of government- sponsored measures for the public welfare, reactor safety research in Germany is involved also in studying severe accidents and, in this effort, not only in ways and means of avoiding them, but also in limiting their impact on the environment. There are two key problems associated with severe accidents: On the one hand, there is the problem of the integrity of the reactor cooling system and of the reactor pressure vessel and, in case this could not be ensured, that of the containment. On the other hand, there is the issue of releases of radioactive substances into the environment. For comprehension and reliable simulation of the interdisciplinary phenomena of systems engineering, physics and chemistry potentially arising in the containment in severe accidents, appropriate models are designed. The Gesellschqft fur Anlagenund Reaktorsicherheit (GRS) has pursued this topic for well over ten years in the development and validation of its COCOSYS (COntainment COde SYStem) systems code. The behavior of iodine is described as a topical example. Iodine transport behavior in the containment is determined by iodine chemistry and by the complex influences of thermal hydraulics. In a containment of 50,000 in 3 volume or more, different iodine concentrations are established in the respective atmospheres as a function of the thermal hydraulics conditions prevailing in different regions of that space. Although COCOSYS had forecast this in the past, these findings had yet to be confirmed experimentally.

J	Schwarz, W				Schwarz, W.			Radiochemistry in nuclear power plants	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								Radiochemistry is employed in nuclear power plants not as an end in itself but, among other things, as a main prerequisite of optimum radiation protection. Radiochemical monitoring of various loops provides important information about sources of radioactivity, activity distribution in the plant and its changes. In the light of these analytical findings, plant crews are able to take measures having a positive effect on radiation levels in the plant. The example of a BWR plant is used to show, among other things, how radiochemical analyses helped to reduce radiation levels in a plant and, as a consequence, to decrease clearly radiation exposure of the personnel despite higher workloads.

The Chart of the Nuclides shows 28 radioactive isotopes of poloniurn (Po) ranging in mass numbers between 190 and 218. Some isotopes have halflives of several years, others have much shorter ones even extending down to the range of microsecends. Nearly all isotopes from natural sources discovered exist on earth only in ,,unweighable" quantities. The article contains descriptions of the basic physical, chemical, geochemical, and radiological properties of polonium, especially those of isotope 210. Moreover, natural and technical sources of polonium are discussed, and the behavior of polonium in the biocycle is outlined.		Stoll, W (reprint author), Ameliastr 25, D-63452 Hanau, Germany.

The main objective was to verify the integral data related to the tritium production on lithium isotopes. Tritium production rates, as well as activation reaction rates were measured inside the beryllium assembly that was shaped as a pseudo-cylindrical slab with an area-equivalent diameter of 628 mm and a thickness of 355 mm. Experimental results were analyzed with a three-dimensional Monte Carlo transport code MCNP-4C and FENDL/MC-2.0, JENDL-3.2/3.3 neutron transport libraries. Evaluation of reaction rates was based on the cross section data taken from the JENDL Dosimetry File and ENDF B-VI data libraries. Analysis shows that all calculation combinations (transport and activation cross section libraries) used for evaluation of reaction rates give data that is agreeable with measured values within 10%.

J	Stacey, WM				Stacey, W. M.			Transmutation missions for fusion neutron sources	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							FUEL-CYCLE ANALYSIS; WASTE REACTOR; NUCLEAR	There are a number of potential neutron transmutation missions (destruction of long-lived radioisotopes in spent nuclear fuel, 'disposal' of surplus weapons-grade plutonium, 'breeding' of fissile nuclear fuel) that perhaps best can be performed in sub-critical nuclear reactors driven by a neutron source. The requirements on a tokamak fusion neutron source for such transmutation missions are significantly less demanding than for commercial electrical power production. A tokamak fusion neutron source based on the current physics and technology database (ITER design base) would meet the needs of the spent nuclear fuel transmutation mission; the technical issue would be achieving >= 50% availability, which would require advances in component reliability and in steady-state physics operation.

In order to have a practical usage for industrial applications, it is important to compile a set of quantitative data on such properties. It is also important to develop fabrication and processing paths to assure the processing of inherently brittle beryllides. The characterization and manufacturing technologies development have been carried out mainly on the Be12Ti interemetallic compounds at the Be-rich side of the Be-Ti binary system. In the present paper, up-dated results on several properties are described for the compound fabricated by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) and ingot metallurgy. Mechanical properties of the compounds having a duplex microstructure with neighboring phases are evaluated by compressive tests from room temperature to 1273 K. Radiation damage of the compound is preliminary studied by charged particle irradiation. Oxidation in air and the interaction with water vapor are evaluated. Thermal desorption of the deuterium is examined by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and thermal desorption spectrometry (TDS). Through these evaluations it seems that Be12Ti is superior as neutron multiplier with respect to pure Be metal. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Ninety male Wistar rats, 8 wk old, were divided into six groups of 15 rats. Rats of five groups were each preinjected intraperitoneally with 8 mg kg(-1) DU in pH 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 solutions. In each pH group, rive rats were injected intraperitoneally with 240 mg kg(-1) CBMEDA, and the other five with 10 mg kg(-1) EHBP; the remaining five were used as the corresponding group with no chelating agent. One group was kept as the control (no injected DU) group, which consisted of five intact, five with CBNMA, and five with EHBP administration. Chelating agents were administered for 3 d. Rats were injected with the DU 30 min prior to treatment with chelating agents on the first day. The gathered data indicated that the DU toxicity varied according to differences in pH; in addition, at pH 7, when varied DU-complexes formed, the DU toxicity including renal dysfunction increased, and the DU removal effects of chelating agents were not obtained. Both CBMEDA and EHBP were effective in excreting DU, reducing DU concentrations in organs, and preventing DU-induced toxicity, and CBMIDA was superior to EHBP, particularly in the prevention of renal dysfunction. These results indicate that the excretion and distribution of soluble DU changes and the removal effects of chelating agents according to pH differs, indicating that the treatment with chelating agent should begin in the DU-contaminated person as early as possible after an accident.

J	Han, T; O'Neal, DL; Ortiz, CA				Han, Taewon; O'Neal, Dennis L.; Ortiz, Carlos A.			A generic-tee-plenum mixing system for application to single point aerosol sampling in stacks and ducts	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						aerosols; sampling; radioactivity, airborne; emissions, atmospheric	ELEMENTS	The ANSI/HPS-NI3.1-1999 standard is based on the concept of obtaining a single point representative sample from a location where the velocity and contaminant profiles are relatively uniform. It is difficult to predict the level of mixing in an arbitrary stack or duct without experimental data to meet the ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999 requirements. The goal of this study was to develop experimental data for a range of conditions in "S" (S-shaped configuration) duct systems with different mixing elements and "S" systems having one or two mixing elements. Results were presented in terms of the coefficients of variation (COVs) for velocity, tracer gas, and 10-mu m aerodynamic diameter (AD) aerosol particle profiles at different downstream locations for each mixing element. Five mixing elements were tested, including a 90 degrees elbow, a commercial static mixer, a Small-Horizontal Generic-Tee-Plenum (SH-GTP), a Small-Vertical Generic-Tee-Plenum (SV-GTP), and a Large-Horizontal Generic-Tee-Plenum (LH-GTP) system. The COVs for velocity, gas concentration, and aerosol particles for the three GTP systems were all determined to be less than 8%. Tests with two different sizes of GTPs were conducted, and the results showed the performance of the GTPs was relatively unaffected by either size or velocity as reflected by the Reynolds number. The pressure coefficients were 0.59, 0.57, and 0.65, respectively, for the SH-GTP, SV-GTP, and LH-GTP. The pressure drop for the GTPs was approximately twice that of the round elbow, but a factor of 5 less than a Type IV Air Blender. The GTP was developed to provide a sampling location less than 4-duct diameters downstream of a mixing element with low pressure drop condition. The object of the developmental effort was to provide a system that could be employed in new stack; however, the concept of GTPs could also be retrofitted onto existing system applications as well. Results from these tests show that the system performance is well within the ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999 mixing criteria-the COVs for velocity, tracer gas, and 10-mu m AD aerosol particles are less than the 20% criteria levels.

In this work, the concentration of Po-210 was determined in 17 of the most frequently smoked cigarette brands in Italy. Samples of tobacco, fresh filters, ash, and post-smoking filters were analyzed; Po-210 was determined by alpha spectrometry after its spontaneous deposition on a silver disk. To verify the radioactive equilibrium between Po-210 and Pb-210, lead was determined in one tobacco sample by counting the beta activity of its decay product Bi-210 with a gas flow proportional detector after separation. The results of the present study show Po-210 concentrations ranged from 6.84 to 17.49 mBq per cigarette. Based on these results, smokers who smoke 20 cigarettes per day inhale, on average, 79.53 +/- 28.65 mBq d(-1) of Po-210 and Pb-210 each. The mean value of the annual committed effective dose for Italian smokers, calculated by applying the dose conversion factor for adults of 4.3 mu Sv Bq(-1) for Po-210 and 5.6 mu Sv Bq(-1) for Pb-210, was estimated to be 124.8 and 162.6 mu Sv y(-1) for Po-210 and Pb-210, respectively. The lung dose from inhalation of cigarette smoke is much higher than the lung dose from inhalation of atmospheric Po-210 and Pb-210.

The diffusion coefficients (effective D-e and apparent D-a) and the distribution coefficient for sorption K-d for Cs-137 in compacted and dispersed bentonite saturated with saline water were investigated at 60 degrees C by four different sorption and diffusion experiments: the in-diffusion, through-diffusion, reservoir-depletion and batch sorption experiments. The system of the through-diffusion experiment was carefully designed to maintain the boundary conditions of constant concentration at each end of the specimen. D-e and D-a were found to be reproducible and showed good consistency among three of the diffusion experiments (through-diffusion, in-diffusion and reservoir depletion). K-d of Cs-137 in compacted bentonite determined from the three types of diffusion experiments was in good accordance with that determined by the batch sorption experiment for dispersed bentonite.

Instrumental neutron activation analysis for the elemental analysis of cement	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Modern Trends om Activation Analysis	JUN 20-25, 2004	Univ Surrey, Guildford, ENGLAND	e	Univ Surrey			Cement is widely used as a construction material in Libya. Production plants introduce certain contaminants to the environment. The dust from such plants is carried away to neighbouring areas. This dust contains a substantial amount of contaminants depending on the origin of clays used in the production. In this study, a survey of elemental concentration of clay and cement was carried out to assess the environmental impact of such plants, especially those that are situated near residential and agricultural areas. Cement and clay samples, imported and locally produced, were analyzed. Instrumental neutron activation analysis was utilized to determine the elemental concentration of As, Ca, Ce, Co, Cr, Eu, Fe, Hf, La, Na, Rb, Sb, Sc, Sm, Ta, Th, U, Yb and Zn. Elevated concentrations of U and Th were found in a number of cement samples. The two nuclides are part of an elaborate decay scheme producing a range of radioactive elements, which emit alpha-, beta- and gamma-radiation. With K-40, they could give elevated levels of background radiation in buildings resulting in higher exposure doses. This could pose a health hazard and a detrimental effect on the well being of residents, especially in poor ventillated buildings. Also, cement is the main component for constructing underground reservoirs for collecting rainwater for drinking in private residences, so some harmful elements could leach into water. This is the first comprehensive survey of commercial cement brands and clays used in Libya. These results are intended to build a database for trace element concentrations using INAA.

The role of NAA in nuclear chemistry education	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Modern Trends om Activation Analysis	JUN 20-25, 2004	Univ Surrey, Guildford, ENGLAND	e	Univ Surrey		NEUTRON-ACTIVATION ANALYSIS; PHYSICS; HOWITZER; DUST	One of the missions of our Institute is the promotion of basic nuclear teaching for students as well as professional teaching for workers in nuclear industry and research. For nuclear chemistry education, we present here a one day teaching course on radioactive decay and nuclear reactions, and a two or three days course based on reactor irradiation of uranium oxide, instrumental and radiochemical analysis of fission products. In the first experiment, the neutron capture is presented as an example of nuclear reaction; the neutron activation of a silver coin with a Am-Be neutron source, followed by gamma-ray spectrometry, is used to identify three radionuclides of silver and to calculate their half-lives. In the second experiment, our teaching reactor is used as a neutron source with a flux about 10(10) n center dot cm(-2)center dot s(-1) at a low thermal power (10 kW). This low flux allows us to irradiate a small uranium sample which is usable for spectrometry after a short cooling time of about two hours. The first day is reserved for instrumental analysis of the fission products and a second day for the radiochemical separation of a fission radionuclides. With these experimental results, the students have to calculate the number of fissions in the irradiated sample. On optional third day for postgraduate students is devoted to the presentation of NAA and some applications as uranium determination by the fission product spectrometry.

Separation and enrichment of Ir from seawater by a simple anion-exchange resin Bio-Rad AG1x8 was carried out prior to neutron activation. Ir concentrations in the vertically distributed Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean seawater samples were in range of 0.85-3.58 pg/l and 1.26-1.97 pg/l, respectively. The reagent blanks of the procedures were 0.42-0.60 pg Ir. It was found that Ir in the Bering Sea and in the Arctic Ocean displayed different types of vertical profiles.

Preconcentration of traces of rhenium in geological matrix by NAA	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Modern Trends om Activation Analysis	JUN 20-25, 2004	Univ Surrey, Guildford, ENGLAND	e	Univ Surrey		SEPARATION; OSMIUM	A simple preconcentration approach for quantitative separation and determination of traces of rhenium in geological matrix using neutron activation analysis is presented in this work. Anionic species of rhenium were collected on small amounts of anion-exchange resin beads from a large-size geological sample solution followed by neutron irradiation of the resin beads and measurements of rhenium activity for its quantification. -200 mg of resin beads were used to concentrate rhenium from 0.5 to 5 gram of the borehole samples. Radioactive tracers of the analyte directly and in the presence of the matrix were used to establish the separation process. During the present work the detection limit of rhenium was found to be 10 ng/g.

Multielement analysis of concrete from nuclear reactors by INAA, ICP-MS and ICP-AES	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Modern Trends om Activation Analysis	JUN 20-25, 2004	Univ Surrey, Guildford, ENGLAND	e	Univ Surrey		NEUTRON-ACTIVATION ANALYSIS	There is a need to know, before dismantling nuclear plants, how the induced radioactivity is distributed in concrete. Computer codes are used to predict such a distribution, by applying input data like, among others, the chemical composition of the material. Biological shield concretes with particularly high boron or barium concentrations had to be analyzed. Instrumental neutron activation analysis is not able to determine all elements, thus, additional techniques are required, like ICP-MS and ICP-AES. The respective performances of these techniques are discussed. For INAA, the thermal neutron self-shielding was empirically corrected by using comparisons between thermal neutron activation (TNAA), epithermal and fast neutron activation ( ENAA), ICP-AES and ICP-MS measurements.

Instrumental neutron activation analysis was used, to determine concentrations of various elements. The k(0) standardization method was used. Some interferences corrections, particularly due to high concentrations of uranium were applied. The quality of the method was checked by using the CRM 140, a Fucus provided by IAEA. Important pollutions appear for several heavy metals from the Morrocan phosphate industry, with respect to the natural background environment.

Monte Carlo generated spectra for QA/QC of automated NAA routine	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Modern Trends om Activation Analysis	JUN 20-25, 2004	Univ Surrey, Guildford, ENGLAND	e	Univ Surrey			A quality check for an automated system of analyzing large sets of neutron activated samples has been developed. Activated samples are counted with an HPGe detector, in conjunction with an automated sample changer and spectral analysis tools, controlled by the Canberra GENIE 2K and REXX software. After each sample is acquired and analyzed, a Microsoft Visual Basic program imports the results into a template Microsoft Excel file where the final concentrations, uncertainties, and detection limits are determined. Standard reference materials are included in each set of 40 samples as a standard quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) test. A select group of sample spectra are also visually reviewed to check the peak fitting routines. A reference spectrum was generated in MCNP 4c2 using an F8, pulse-height, tally with a detector model of the actual detector used in counting. The detector model matches the detector resolution, energy calibration, and counting geometry. The generated spectrum also contained a radioisotope matrix that was similar to what was expected in the samples. This spectrum can then be put through the automated system and analyzed along with the other samples. The automated results are then compared to expected results for QA/QC assurance.

Monte Carlo evaluation of the muon-induced background in the GERDA double beta decay experiment	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						neutrinoless double beta decay; cosmic ray background	DARK-MATTER SEARCHES; GRAN-SASSO 1990-2003; GERMANIUM DETECTORS; GEANT4; SIMULATION; PHYSICS; ENERGY; GE-76; PROPAGATION	The new generation of experiments searching for neutrinoless double beta decay is aiming at a background level of 10(-3) counts/(kg keV y) or better at the respective Q-values. Cosmic ray muons can be a significant contribution due to a number of physics processes. The GERmanium Detector Array, GERDA, located at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory in Italy, uses germanium enriched in Ge-76 as source and detector material. Germanium is submerged into liquid nitrogen or argon that acts as cooling medium and radiation shield simultaneously. A detailed GEANT4-based Monte Carlo simulation was performed to calculate the photon and neutron fluxes induced by cosmic ray muons. The prompt background contributions from gamma-ray and neutron interactions as well as the delayed contributions due to the production of radioactive isotopes within the setup are given.

Fission fragments from an uranium target are thermalized in a large helium gas cell and extracted by a combination of do and inhomogeneous rf electric fields. They are subsequently mass separated by an electromagnetic mass separator. Test experiments with a radioactive a-source and with fission fragments produced in the proton-induced fission of U-238 reveal that the yields of mass-separated radioactive ion beams are enhanced, due to the do and rf electric fields in the gas cell.

The mechanical compatibility can be assessed for the fuel management, primary heat transport system, fuel channel, and fuel handling system in the reactor core by both experimental and analytic methods. Because the physical dimensions of the DUPIC fuel bundle adopt the CANDU flexible (CANFLEX) fuel bundle design, which has already been demonstrated for a commercial use in CANDU reactors, the experimental compatibility analyses focused on the generation of material property data and the irradiation tests of the DUPIC fuel, which are used for the computational analysis. The intermediate results of the mechanical compatibility analysis have shown that the integrity of the DUPIC fuel is mostly maintained under the high-power and high-burnup conditions even though some material properties, such as the thermal conductivity, are a little lower compared to the uranium fuel. However, it is required that the current DUPIC fuel design be changed slightly to accommodate the high internal pressure of the fuel element. It is also strongly recommended that more irradiation tests of the DUPIC fuel be performed to accumulate a database for the demonstration of the DUPIC fuel performance in the CANDU reactor.

Zirconium matrix cermet for a mixed uranium-thorium oxide fuel in an SBWR	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						zirconium cermet fuel; thorium fuel cycle; high-burnup simplified boiling water reactor		The thorium oxide fuel cycle has been a viable technology option since the beginning of the nuclear era. By placing (Th, U)O-2 in a zirconium matrix, the resulting cermet nuclear fuel properties create a strong negative void reactivity coefficient, which is especially appealing for boiling water reactor applications. The combination of the thorium fuel cycle and zirconium matrix cermets has enabled a new core design for a simplified boiling water reactor (SBWR). Core design simulations show that an 8-yr fuel cycle is achievable using this fuel concept. Further, if burnable poisons are added to the powder fabrication mix, an essentially flat reactivity swing is created that could enable an autonomous control system. In addition to the SBWR core design, a preliminary investigation is presented for experimental fuel fabrication methods designed to simplify cermet fabrication. Spray drying and sintering were used to create mixed-oxide (Th, U)O-2 powders with a nominal diameter of similar to 200 mu m, with similar to 10 vol% uniformly distributed porosity and nominal grain size of 5 mu m. In addition, a low-temperature cermet fabrication method was used to fabricate simulated fuel pins with a porous zirconium matrix.

The models have been improved for the fuel thermal conductivity, the fission gas release, and the cladding corrosion and creep. In particular, the thermal conductivity and fission gas release models were restructured with due consideration for the inhomogeneity of the MOX fuel. These improvements enhanced COSMOS's precision for predicting the in-pile behavior of the MOX fuel. The COSMOS code also extends its applicability to the sophisticatedly instrumented fuel test in a research reactor. With the improved models, the recent in-pile test results were analyzed and compared with the code's prediction. The database consists of the instrumented MOX fuel test in a research reactor, the postirradiation examination results after an irradiation in a commercial reactor, and a preliminary instrumented test in the HANARO reactor. With the rigorously characterized fabrication data and irradiation information, the COSMOS code predicted the in-pile behaviors well, such as the fuel temperature, rod internal pressure, fission gas release, and cladding properties of MOX and UO2 fuels. The estimations by COSMOS also demonstrated its applicability to the instrumented irradiation test.

J	Ahn, J				Ahn, Joonhong			Environmental impact of Yucca Mountain Repository in the case of canister failure	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						radiotoxicity; environmental impact; Yucca Mountain Repository	TRANSPORT; MODEL	Mathematical models and a computation code have been developed for total release of transuranic (TRU) and fission product radionuclides from waste packages in the Yucca Mountain Repository (YMR) into the surrounding geosphere in the case of simultaneous package failure. The total amount of these radionuclides in the geosphere, which is called the environmental impact in this paper, has been expressed in terms of radiotoxicity. Inventory abstraction has been made, based on the data provided in the Final Environmental Impact Statement published by the U.S. Department of Energy. Various types of waste packages in the YMR have been abstracted into commercial spent nuclear fuel (CSNF) and defense waste. For defense waste, co-disposal and naval spent fuel have been abstracted separately. Numerical results show that within the total environmental impact, contribution from the defense waste packages is about 10%, which is close to the fraction of the repository capacity allocated for defense waste. Impacts due to isotopes of TRU and their decay daughters are dominant, compared with those from fission product nuclides. If the mass of TRU nuclides to be disposed of in the repository were reduced by a factor of 100, the impact from defense waste.

This additional correction accounts for the decay of radioactivity during the dead time, and therefore the expression for the additional correction includes the specimen half-life. This additional correction is significant for some specialized applications involving very short-lived nuclides. These results may be useful for neutron activation analysis of short-lived isotopes and certain medical imaging applications.

In particular, the paper investigates the effects of the 237Np or 231Pa production zone thickness and the composition of the next zone on the production rates of fissionable isotopes under neutron irradiation of U-238 or Th-232. It is demonstrated that relatively thin ( about 10 cm thick) uranium or thorium zones should be applied for the production of 237Np and 231Pa. Also, it is revealed that incorporation of Np-237 or Pa-231 production zones into the blanket module of an International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor type of fusion facility leads to reduced attenuation of the fast-neutron flux by the blanket module.

The limitations of modern reactors are the low fission materials breeding in thermal reactors and the large amount of uranium needed for start-up of fast reactors. Thermal reactor breeding can be increased under the following conditions: a decrease in the neutron losses in structural materials, leakage and operative control, and the use of a closed balanced fuel cycle. In this case, some of the raw U-235 in the fuel at the start of the campaign decreases. Replacement of the raw U-235 by U-233 produced from thorium increases the raw usage up to 100%. The yield of 233U in a fission reactor decreases the burning-out. Production of U-233 by a tokamak-based volumetric neutron source (VNS) removes the burning-out limitation. In this case, the energy consumed by the VNS is much less than the gain in the fission reactor energy production.

J	Kim, SI; Lee, KJ				Kim, Sung Il; Lee, Kun Jai			Requirement of decontamination factor for near-surface disposal of PEACER wastes	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						decontamination factor; PEACER; disposal		A pyrochemical process has been introduced and utilized so that the transmutation of spent PWR fuel in PEACER can produce mainly low- and intermediate-level waste for near-surface disposal. Major radioactive nuclides from PEACER pyroprocessing are composed of transuranic element (TRU) and long-lived fission product (LLFP). In this study, the requirement for the final waste from PEACER is evaluated based on the methodology for establishment of waste acceptance criteria. Also, sensitivity analysis for several input parameters is conducted in order to determine acceptable decontamination factor (DF) and LLFP removal efficiency and to find out input parameter that extremely has an effect on DF. As a result of the study, LLFP removal efficiency, especially Sr-90 and Tc-99, is proved to be a major nuclide which contributes to annual dose by human intrusion scenario rather than TRU DF. To satisfy the acceptance criteria, DF for TRU and removal efficiency for LLFP have to be achieved more than 104 and 96%, respectively. Besides, because of the relative short half-life of Sr-90, the increasing of the institutional control period is recommended for the most important input parameter to determine DF.

J	Osmanlioglu, AE				Osmanlioglu, Ahmet Erdal			Progress in cementation of reactor resins	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						radioactive resins; cementation; bentonite; fly ash	IMMOBILIZATION; OPTIMIZATION	Effect of bentonite and ash additives on the leaching and strength properties of cement-resin matrix was investigated. Three groups of samples have been prepared by cementation of low-level-radioactive resin. These are (A) cement-resin-ash matrix, (B) cement-resin-bentonite matrix and (C) cement-resin matrix. Each of the samples has different amounts of resin, cement, water and additives. Water/Cement ratio of the samples was arranged in the range of 0.4-0.5. Group (A) samples included fly ash as an additive in the range of 10-30% (w/w). Group (B) samples included bentonite as an additive in the range of 3-12% (w/w). Group (C) samples were prepared without any additives. Leaching rates of radionuclides (Co-60, Cs-137) and stabilities of these waste forms were compared to each other. Although long-term leach tests showed that bentonite additives significantly decrease the leaching rates (4.85 x 10(-8) kg m(2)/s for Co-60 and 2.68 x 10(-8) kg m(2)/s for Cs-137), compressive strength of these samples was not sufficient for handling. Optimum values have been measured by the tests of samples B4 and B5 in this group. Bentonite contents of these samples were between 5 and 7% (w/w). Evaluation of test results showed that optimum ratio of resin to matrix material was between 0.36 and 0.67. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

S.; Kwak, Tai-Wan			A comparison of the HLW underground repository cost for the vertical and horizontal emplacement options in Korea	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						cost estimation; spent fuel; repository; construction cost; cost driver		This study presents the results of an economic analysis for a comparison of the vertical and horizontal emplacement alternatives with respect to an HLW repository. According to the cost analysis undertaken in the Korean case, the horizontal emplacement option was more economical than the vertical one. In order to estimate such an emplacement alternative, a conceptual framework should be designed first to the cost objects, and then cost drivers and economic indicators are taken into consideration. The major difference between a vertical emplacement and a horizontal one was that the long horizontal disposal drifts of the horizontal emplacement replace the disposal holes and disposal tunnels of the vertical emplacement with vertical holes. Therefore, in the case of a horizontal emplacement, several canisters are installed in the long horizontal disposal drifts instead of one canister per one disposal hole of the vertical emplacement option.
