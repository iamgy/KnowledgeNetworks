This function will be fulfilled by transfer cask systems. This paper describes the recent design progresses on interfaces in order to increase components handling feasibility by implementing continuous guiding features that avoid cantilevered loads on the in-cask tractor. Also the design has progressed in order to allow generic docking of the casks. When the cask is connected to the port, it becomes part of the machine first confinement boundary, thus it must provide tightness continuity. This high level safety function was one of the main concerns of a finite element analysis study that has been performed to assess the behavior of the whole system. Numerical analysis methodology and results are explained and shown in order to highlight how it has reinforced the knowledge of the system. (C) 2011 International Fusion Energy Organization.

Conceptual design of the hot cell facility universal docking station at ITER	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	26th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2010	Porto, PORTUGAL			ITER; Docking; Universal; Hot Cell Facility; Cask		Between main shutdowns of the ITER machine, in-vessel components and Iter Remote Maintenance System (IRMS) are transferred between the Tokamak complex and the Hot Cell Facility using different types of sealed casks. Transfer Casks have different physical interfaces with the Vacuum Vessel, which need to be the same at the docking stations of the HCF. It means that in-vessel components and IRMS are cleaned in the same cells, which is in fact not convenient. Furthermore, logistic studies showed that the use rate of the cells is very inhomogeneous. In order to have dedicated cell for decontamination of Remote Handling tools, in order to increase the operability efficiency and to removes the hot cell docking operation from the critical path, the concept of a universal docking station has been investigated. Based on an existing design, the work was focused on a review of requirements, the re-design and the integration within the HCF layout. The universal docking station has been proposed and is now integrated in HCF design. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Dammann, A.; Benchikhoune, M.; Friconneau, J.

Operability of the ITER Hot Cell Facility	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	26th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2010	Porto, PORTUGAL			Maintenance; Facility integration; Operability		The maintenance operation of the ITER in-vessel components are executed in the Hot Cell Facility (HCF). Therefore maintenance requirements and the operability analysis are essential inputs for the design. To fulfill the maintenance strategy, the HCF shall be capable of refurbishing and replacing vacuum vessel components and processing radwaste simultaneously. Based on the top level project requirements, the design scenario giving the most stringent constraints is based on the following tasks during the main shutdown: replacement of 54 cassettes, 3 Test Blanket Modules Port Plugs, the In Vessel Viewing System, the repair of 2 Equatorial and 2 Upper Port Plugs and the use of the Multi-Purpose Deployer. The operability between shutdowns needs also to be compliant with scheduled and unscheduled maintenance tasks. Furthermore, regular maintenance of the facility itself needs to be considered. This paper will outline the methodology, the basic tasks considered and it will present the schedule during shutdown and between shutdown periods. The goal is also to check the use rate of each workstation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. Published by All rights reserved.

ITER remote maintenance system configuration model overview	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	26th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2010	Porto, PORTUGAL			ITER; Maintenance; Remote handling; Design integration		A challenge for the ITER project is to manage the design of many systems being developed in parallel. In order to control the machine configuration and ensure proper design integration, the ITER project has implemented the so-called "configuration management models" (CMMs), aimed at controlling and managing the machine systems' interfaces. Specific issues are raised for modelling the ITER remote maintenance system (IRMS). That system shall provide the mean to support the remote maintenance operations for in-vessel components, remote transfer of activated components between the vacuum vessel (VV) and the hot cell facility and remote repairing, refurbishing and/or processing operations in the hot cell facility. The IRMS are dynamic, constantly changing morphologies, working envelopes and locations within the plant. This raises the issue of how to integrate the dynamic nature of this equipment into the CMM required for design integration. This paper describes the design methodology that is being developed to address the specific nature of the IRMS in the building of the CMM and gives examples to demonstrate the benefits to be gained by adopting this approach.

ITER Hot Cell process operability analysis using discrete event simulation tools	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	26th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2010	Porto, PORTUGAL			Remote handling; Hot Cell; Simulation; Optimisation		This paper reports on the use of Discrete Event Simulation tools for operability analysis of the Iter Hot Cell (HC) design. A simulation model representing the operation of the ITER Hot Cell has been created. The model incorporates the process logic for ITER components that are required to be refurbished, maintained and disposed of Within the Hot Cell. This paper presents some results of the simulation indicating the performance of the Hot Cell for Divertor and Port Plug refurbishment. The results show that based on the established task durations a full 54 cassette Divertor refurbishment takes 4536 h, longer than the planned 6-month shutdown scheduled for the task. The simulation provides a platform to accurately size the capacity of process equipment with respect to given budgetary constraints and to identify opportunities to smooth the process flow. Effects of parameters such as human resource shift patterns, equipment mean time between failure and random variability in process times on overall Hot Cell productivity have been studied. The simulation model is flexible, capable of evolving in parallel with the Hot Cell design as more detailed input data becomes available thereby providing a valuable decision making and design optimisation tool throughout the development of the Hot Cell and beyond that into operation.

Application of remote handling compatibility on ITER plant	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	26th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2010	Porto, PORTUGAL			Remote handling; RH compatibility		The ITER plant will require fully remote maintenance during its operational life. For this to be effective, safe and efficient the plant will have to be developed in accordance with remote handling (RH) compatibility requirements. A system for ensuring RH compatibility on plant designed for Tokamaks was successfully developed and applied, inter alia, by the authors when working at the JET project. The experience gained in assuring RH compatibility of plant at JET is now being applied to RH relevant ITER plant. The methodologies required to ensure RH compatibility of plant include the standardization of common plant items, standardization of RH features, availability of common guidance on RH best practice and a protocol for design and interface review and approval. The protocol in use at ITER is covered by the ITER Remote Maintenance Management System (IRMMS) defines the processes and utilization of management controls including Plant Definition Forms (PDF), Task Definition Forms (TDFs) and RH Compatibility Assessment Forms (RHCA) and the ITER RH Code of Practice. This paper will describe specific examples where the authors have applied the methodology proven at JET to ensure remote handling compatibility on ITER plant. Examples studied are: circle ELM coils (to be installed in-vessel behind the Blanket Modules) - handling both in-vessel, in Casks and at the Hot Cell as well as fully remote installation and connection (mechanical and electrical) in-vessel. circle Neutral beam systems (in-vessel and in the NB Cell) - beam sources, cesium oven, beam line components (accessed in the NB Cell) and Duct Liner (remotely replaced from in-vessel). circle Divertor (in-vessel) - cooling pipe work and remotely operated electrical connector. The RH compatibility process can significantly affect plant design. This paper should therefore be of interest to all parties who develop ITER plant designs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The NB IRMS will be installed and removed with the assistance of human workers during the preparation, and post-operation phase. During the maintenance operation after opening the Passive Magnetic Shield (PMS) and vessels, the maintenance activity and recovery from failure should be conducted remotely. This paper describes the concept design of the NB IRMS operating inside the NB cell for maintenance of the plant equipment such as NB components, and Upper Port Plugs (UPP). The main tasks of the IRMS, the description of the subsystems and their specification, and deployment/operation principles are presented.

Feasibility of Upper Port Plug tube handling	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	26th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2010	Porto, PORTUGAL			Tube; Upper Port Plug; Diagnostic; Handling; Hot Cell Facility; Shut down		Central, retractable tubes are proposed in several Upper Port Plugs (UPPs) designs for ITER, to enable fast exchange of specific components of diagnostics housed in these UPPs. This paper investigates into possible designs to enable the efficient handling of tubes. The feasibility of tube handling is analysed by first reviewing the designs drivers. Several concepts for handling of the tube are proposed, exploring the limits described by the design drivers. Suggestions are presented for tube integration into the UPP design, concerning the tube mounting into the UPP, the load takeover and coping with the thermal elongation. It is found that the handling of tubes is feasible but still requires a lot of system level integration. Also, the added value of a tube as a feature in an UPP design to the availability of the subsystem the UPP is a part of, is questionable and needs further assessment on ITER system level.

During this process, the activated divertor will cause a large increase of radiation in the ITER building. 3D analysis has been performed to assess the radiation maps throughout the ITER building for assisting the shielding design for personnel and sensitive equipment. The activation of the divertor has been determined by coupled neutron transport and inventory calculations, radiation maps have been obtained from gamma transport calculations. The neutron and gamma transport calculations have been performed by MCNP5 code with FENDL2.1library. The inventory calculations have been performed by FISPACT2007 code with EAF-2007 library. The results of these 3D decay gamma radiation maps are presented by pictures in this paper, including the biological dose maps and maps of heat deposition in electronic equipment.

Transfer cask system design activities: status and plan	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	26th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2010	Porto, PORTUGAL			ITER; Fusion For Energy; Remote Handling; Cask & Plug Remote Handling System; Maintenance		The ITER Cask & Plug Remote Handling System (CPRHS), a.k.a. Transfer Cask System, is a critical element of the ITER Remote Maintenance System (IRMS) devoted to transportation of components between the Tokamak building and Hot Cell. Due to the necessary confinement of contaminated components the CPRHS is defined as Safety Importance Class 1 (SIC-1) plus the mobile nature of the CPRHS brings with it a significant number of complex interfaces with other ITER sub-systems. With a total CPRHS fleet in excess of 20 units, including seven typologies, the management of design and procurement needs to be carefully planned and implemented to ensure compliance with ITER's requirements. Fusion for Energy (F4E) and its beneficiaries/contractors are currently working under ITER Task Agreements (ITAs) on the conceptual design of the CPRHS and, following the signing of the Procurement Arrangement (PA) in mid 2012, will take responsibility for the entire CPRHS fleet. F4E must, therefore, develop a robust strategy to meet the needs of both ITER machine assembly (for which a number of CPRHS units will be utilised) and the remote maintenance of ITER. Within this context this paper will present the status of the current CPRHS design activities, highlight some of the significant issues which will be faced during procurement and present the overall strategy which is being implemented by F4E in order to meet these challenging objectives.

Enhancement of the remote handling strategy for the refurbishment of the backplate bayonet concept of IFMIF target system	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	26th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2010	Porto, PORTUGAL			IFMIF; Target assembly; Remote handling		One of the most technically challenging activities of the IFMIF facility is the maintenance and the refurbishment of its components, and among these the target system appears to be critical since it is located in the most severe region of neutron irradiation (60 dpa/fpy). Two different target assembly systems have been developed: the first is known as integral target while the second one is based on the so called replaceable backplate bayonet concept. The present remote handling (RH) procedures developed for the refurbishment of the removable backplate foresee the removal of all the components from the upper part of the test cell. This operation has a strong impact on the intervention time for the backplate refurbishment which has to be repeated at least every year. Consequently the need to update the RH strategy for the refurbishment of this component becomes a precondition in order to fulfill the stringent requirement to enhance the duty cycle of IFMIF plant. In this paper two potential approaches are presented: the first relies on the possibility to perform all the refurbishment operations in situ in the test cell cavern, whilst the second one foresees to perform these operations off-line in a hot cell. Advantages and disadvantages of these approaches together with the RH requirements for the refurbishment operations of the backplate bayonet concepts are also reported. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The inner part of CVP is used for the condensation of hydrogen, deuterium, etc. and chevrons are used to protect the inner part from the radiation and gas loads. The inner part is cooled with cold helium (He) and operated at 3.4 K and 3.9 K during peak power and standard modes of operation. The chevrons are operated at 80 K and supplied with liquid nitrogen (LN(2)). Three different helium cooling schemes were worked out using forced flow supercritical helium, namely, parallel flow, parallel flow with intermediate sub-cooling and series flow with intermediate sub-cooling. For the chevrons, three cooling schemes, i.e. bath cooling, forced flow two phase and single phase with pump, were worked out. The analysis involved the process calculations and thermo-hydraulic calculations considering the operational requirements of CVP. The optimisation was also coupled with the LN(2) heat exchangers of the helium refrigerator to find the optimum flow scheme. The regeneration of inner part up to LN(2) temperatures and the complete CVP up to ambient conditions is foreseen without affecting the other cooling applications connected to refrigerator.

Tritium distribution and chemical forms in the irradiated beryllium pebbles before and after thermoannealing	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	26th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2010	Porto, PORTUGAL			Beryllium; Tritium inventory; Chemical forms; Structure	NEUTRON-IRRADIATION; RELEASE; PERFORMANCE	Beryllium pebbles are foreseen as a neutron multiplier in the tritium breeding blanket of the future fusion devices. Tritium inventory in the beryllium as a result of neutron-induced transmutations is a significant safety and technological issue for the operation of the breeding blanket. In this study, beryllium pebbles from 3 different irradiation experiments: BERYLLIUM, EXOTIC 8/3-13 and PBA, performed at High Flux Reactor HFR have been investigated. The distribution of tritium in the bulk of the pebbles and the abundance ratios of chemical forms of tritium T(0), T(+) and T(2) have been analysed before and after the different thermo-annealing experiments. In order to determine the abundance ratios of chemical forms, the method of chemical scavengers has been used. The structure analysis has been done by scanning electron microscopy. The main chemical form of the tritium localized in the irradiated beryllium pebbles is T(2), especially in the pebbles from PBA experiment. As a result of thermo-annealing, the abundances of the T(2) and T(0) change, T(+) stays unaffected up to relatively high temperatures. The distribution of the tritium in the bulk is uneven - it increases rapidly at the centre of the pebble. Changes of pebble structure as a result of thermal treatment have been observed.

This article supported by the EFDA Goal Oriented Training Program Eurobreed presents the difference in results between the CEA MC code TRIPOLI-4 and MCNP on two fusion neutronics benchmarks, assessing therefore TRIPOLI-4 calculation capabilities on shielding and tritium production rate (TPR). The first selected benchmark, assessing the shielding capability, is the Frascati neutron generator (FNG) ITER bulk shield experiment whereas the second benchmark, assessing the TPR calculation, is the preliminary design of the FNG helium cooled lithium lead (HCLL) test blanket module (TBM) mock-up. To ensure the consistency of the geometry description, MCAM tool is used for automatic TRIPOLI - MCNP geometry conversions and check. A good coherence between TRIPOLI-4 and MCNP for neutron flux, reaction rates and TPR calculations is obtained. Moreover, it appears that MCAM performs fast, automatic and appropriate TRIPOLI MCNP geometry conversions and finally that the tabulated FNG neutron source model from KIT is appropriate for TRIPOLI-4 calculations.

Test Blanket Module Pipe Forest integration in ITER equatorial port	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	26th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2010	Porto, PORTUGAL			Test Blanket Modules; ITER; RCC-MR; Pipe Forest; Design		ITER Test Blanket Modules (TBMs) will allow testing Breeding Blanket concepts for a future application in DEMO. IRFM (Institut de Recherche sur la Fusion Magnetique) contribution to this test program consists in the integration of the 2 European TBMs (Helium Cooled Lithium Lead and Helium Cooled Pebble Bed) in a dedicated equatorial port. The two Breeding Blanket concepts use Helium gas as a coolant, liquid PbLi as breeder (for HCLL process) and Helium gas for Tritium extraction (for HCPB process). These materials are passing through the cryostat interspace forming a pipe network called the Pipe Forest. The main structural function of the Pipe Forest is to absorb the thermal expansion due to the Vacuum Vessel and due to the pipe system itself. The Pipe Forest has to cope with several design issues. In this study, the different key parameters of the Pipe Forest design are identified and their relative influence is analysed. Several design options were investigated and compared based on: - Thermo-mechanical finite element calculations - Pipe Forest integration within the cryostat interspace - Interface management - Assembly and maintenance scenarios - Complex pipe routing due to the expansion bends - RCC-MR 2007 requirements The chosen thermal compensation solution (thermal expansion loops) led to a Pipe Forest design. The CAE analysis of this Pipe Forest showed that it fulfills the requirements of the RCC-MR 2007, which is the reference design and construction code selected for the European TBM.

The pebble bed will not take part in the structural rigidity of a breeder unit. Still the pebbles need to withstand forces originating from thermal expansion mismatches and neutron irradiation. A designated breeder ceramic for this concept is lithium orthosilicate with a slight surplus of silica. It has been demonstrated that lithium orthosilicate can be processed by melt spraying, which is favorable to other processes in terms of recycling. This work summarizes changes to the process and investigations of the current limitations that have to be overcome to enhance not only the mechanical properties of the pebbles, but also the yield of the process. A key feature of the improvements is to control the forming of the single pebbles more precisely than in the past. Thereby, not only the generation of pores should be avoided, but also the size distribution of the pebbles should be more accurately controlled. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recent activities of R&D on effects of tritium water on confinement materials and tritiated water processing	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	26th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2010	Porto, PORTUGAL			Tritium; Tritiated water; Permeation; Chemical exchange; Durability; Corrosion	JAEA	The permeation behavior of tritium through pure iron into the gas containing water vapor has been studied. It was found that the permeation rate of tritium was almost the same as that with no water vapor, and the major chemical form of tritium was HTO. It was also found that the permeation rate was decreased to similar to 1/10 of the above value by plated with gold, and the major chemical form was HT. As for the behavior of high concentration tritium water, it was observed that the formation of the oxidized layer was prevented by the presence of tritium in water (0.23 GBq/cc). A set of data for an advanced chemical exchange column has been obtained as R&D on the tritiated water processing. The packing and catalyst were uniformly mixed into the advanced column. It has been proved that there was possibility that the advanced column has a large separation factor in comparison with the ordinary columns, where the packing and catalyst were alternately packed. Tritium durability tests were also carried out for the electrolysis cell of the chemical exchange column. The ion conductivity of the main material of the cell (Nafion) was hardly decreased even in the case of 1600 kGy irradiation by gamma ray. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this respect, the present paper reports on sensitivity and uncertainty analyses for the EU HCLL Test Blanket Module (TBM) of ITER. Neutron flux spectra and tritium production rates have been calculated using MCNP with a modified version of the ITER Alite torus sector model with integrated TBMs. Sensitivities of such parameters to nuclear cross sections of isotopes contained in the TBM as well as in the ITER device have been calculated using the Monte Carlo code MCSEN. Uncertainties could be obtained by using existing covariance data of the important nuclear cross section files, mainly from ENDF/B-VI, SCALE6.0, but also from recent JEFF/EFF evaluations. Like in the HCLL mock-up experiment two positions at front and back of the TBM have been selected. In both cases the calculated uncertainties of the responses (tritium production rate, neutron flux) are in the range of 2-4%. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this work, transportation properties of multi-component hydrogen isotopes including tritium were investigated experimentally. Ceramic proton conductor membrane used in this work was SrCe(0.95)Yb(0.05)O(3-alpha) made by TYK Co. H(2)-D(2) mixture balanced with He was supplied to the hydrogen pump, that was kept at 873 K and applied the voltage between 0 and 1000 mV, and the permeated gas was analyzed with a gas chromatograph. The rate-determining step of hydrogen transfer via ceramic membrane seems to be close to the diffusion step in the bulk of ceramic with increase of the applied voltage. HT-H(2) mixture balanced with He was also supplied to the hydrogen pump, and recovery of tritium via ceramic membrane was done. Diffusivity of hydrogen in the proton conductor ceramic is larger than that of tritium. Hence, hydrogen is enriched in the gas of the permeation side. In this experimental condition, about 40% of tritium supplied was recovered and the decontamination factor was 1.5. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Efficient tritium oxidation performance at room temperature has been strongly required taking a severe accident in a facility into consideration. We have developed hydrophobic Pt catalysts applicable for tritium oxidation in the presence of saturated water vapor at room temperature. A new type of hydrophobic catalyst, Pt/ASDBC, has been prepared by dipositting platinum on alkyl-styrene diviyl-benzene copolymer (ASDBC). Tritium oxidation tests of the catalysts using 3 GBq/m(3) of tritium were performed in the absence/presence of saturated water vapor at room temperature. The overall reaction rate constant for Pt/ASDBC catalyst in the ambient temperature range was considerably larger than that for the traditionally applied Pt/Al(2)O(3) catalyst. Oxidation reaction on the catalyst surface is the rate-controlling step in the ambient temperature range. The overall reaction rate constant in the ambient temperature range was dependent on the space velocity and hydrogen concentration in carrier. Values of the overall reaction rate constant in the ambient temperature range were correlated to k(overall) =1.60 x 10(5)exp(-33.0 (kJ/mol)/R(g)/T) (s(-1)) at the space velocity of 5556 h(-1) under the dry condition.

New lithium isotope separation technique using ionic-liquid impregnated organic membranes (lonic-Liquid-i-OMs) have been developed. Lithium ions are able to move by electrodialysis through certain lonic-Liquid-i-OMs between the cathode and the anode in lithium solutions. In this report, the effects of protection cover and membrane thickness on the durability of membrane and the efficiency of isotope separation were evaluated. In order to improve the durability of the Ionic-Liquid-i-OM, we developed highly-durable Ionic-Liquid-i-OM. Both surfaces of the Ionic-Liquid-i-OM were covered by a nafion 324 overcoat or a cation exchange membrane (SELEMION (TM) CMD) to prevent the outflow of the ionic liquid. It was observed that the durability of the Ionic-Liquid-i-OM was improved by a nafion 324 overcoat. On the other hand, the organic membrane selected was I, 2 or 3 mm highly-porous Teflon film, in order to efficiently impregnate the ionic liquid. The (6)Li isotope separation factor by electrodialysis using highly-porous Teflon film of 3 mm thickness was larger than using that of 1 or 2 mm thickness. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the mass of Li(2)TiO(3) decreased with time by Li evaporation in a hydrogen atmosphere and by Li burn-up. In order to prevent the mass decrease at high temperatures, Li(2)TiO(3) with added Li (Li(2+x)TiO(3+y)) have been developed as one of advanced tritium breeders. Li(2)TiO(3) with added Li was synthesized from proportionally mixed LiOH center dot H(2)O and H(2)TiO(3) with a Li/Ti ratio of 2.2, and then the sol-gel method were selected as the candidate for the pebble fabrication technique of advanced tritium breeders. In this study, trial fabrication of pebbles was performed by the sol-gel method. The diameter of the pebbles is 1.18 mm, and the sphericity is 1.04. The density of the pebbles is about 89%T.D analyzed by mercury intrusion technique. Molar ratio (Li/Ti) of the sintered pebbles evaluated by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) is 2.12. These results show that the pebble fabrication using the sol-gel method is a promising production technique for mass production of the advanced tritium breeder pebbles. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Design of Pd-based membrane reactor for gas detritiation	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	26th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2010	Porto, PORTUGAL			Pd membrane reactor; Hydrogen isotopes separation; Detritiation	PERMCAT REACTOR; SYSTEM; CLEANUP; ALLOY	The development of a Pd-based membrane reactor to be applied in processes for tritium removal from various gaseous streams of tokamak systems has been carried out. In particular, the membrane reactor has been designed for decontaminating soft housekeeping wastes of JET. This membrane reactor consists of Pd-Ag permeator tube fixed in a finger-like mode into a stainless steel shell. The feed stream (gases to be detritiated) is fed inside the membrane lumen where the isotopic exchange takes place on to a catalyst bed while pure hydrogen (protium) is sent in countercurrent mode in the shell side. The feed stream consists of 200 Ncm(3) min(-1) of helium with 10% of tritiated water (tritium content 1.11 x 10(8) Bq h(-1)). The membrane reactor design has been based on a simplified calculation model which takes into consideration the very low tritium content of the gas to be processed and the complete oxidation of the tritiated species in the feed stream. The model considers a tubular Pd-Ag membrane divided into finite elements where the mass balances are performed according to both the thermodynamic equilibrium reactions and permeation rates through the membrane of the hydrogen isotopes. The reactor model has permitted to verify that a Pd-Ag commercial tube of diameter 10 mm, length 500 mm and wall thickness 0.150 mm is capable to attain a decontamination factor larger than 10. A new mechanical design of the Pd membrane reactor has been also developed: especially, harmful mechanical stresses of the long permeator tube consequent to the hydrogenation and thermal cycling has been avoided. Furthermore, an innovative effective heating system of the membrane has been also applied. (C) 2011 EURATOM ENEA Association-ENEA Unit. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

On the other hand, the influence of the reflector on the TPR prediction accuracy was not seen in the recent blanket experiment with a natural Li2TiO3 layer, beryllium layers and the reflector. We investigated the former experiment in detail, and found an unphysical tendency in the measured TPR distribution. In order to clarify whether the deterioration of the TPR prediction accuracy originates from the reflector or not, we have conducted the same experiment as the previous experiment again. In the present experiment, the measured TPR distribution inside the (6)Li-enriched Li(2)TiO(3) layer agreed well with the calculated value within an estimated experimental error of 6%. We conclude that the overestimation of TPR observed in the previous experiment would be due to some experimental faults and that the TPR prediction accuracy is good even in the case with the reflector.

The driving deuterium pressure dependence of the coated sample shows a large surface contribution. Deuterium trapping in the amorphous structure is suggested by the temporal change in the permeation flux. Permeation reduction factors of 10(3) are achieved with 1.5-mu m-thick coated F82H at 723-823 K; however, the coating degraded at 873 K. Cracks are generated in the coating because of the tensile stress derived from a large difference in the thermal expansion between the coating and the steel. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

For the development of metal hydride bed, rapid delivery/recovery rate according to the tokamak operation scenario and accurate and rapid measurement of tritium inventory are major concerns. It has to store the tritium safely and satisfy the requirements of the facility where metal hydride bed is installed. To fulfill these requirements, we developed a thin double-layered annulus metal hydride bed. A mock-up with the capacity of 70 g tritium storage (1250 g ZrCo) is fabricated. Using hydrogen gas, the recovery and delivery performance during absorption or desorption process is tested. With 7.5 mole of H(2) gas, the recovery rate of 72.5 Pa m(3)/s for 90% absorption and the delivery rate of 15.6 Pa m(3)/5 for 90% desorption is achieved. The thermal insulation test and tritium inventory measurement test using in-bed gas flowing calorimetry are also performed. It took less than 24 h for the in-bed calorimetry procedure to reach the steady state. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Under the environment with various fuelling scenarios and with the limitation of tritium compatible equipments it is needed to determine the process design for the fuel delivery in the SDS. The SDS has functions to satisfy the various fuelling scenarios, to minimize the tritium inventory in vapor state, and to operate safely. Based on the preliminary analysis, the configuration of pumps is selected as the three and two parallel-combined MB 601 pumps for the fuelling of T2 and D2(T) gases, respectively. The volumes of buffer vessels are determined as 0.4 m(3) and 0.3 m(3) as minimum values to satisfy the all fuelling scenarios with 120 kPa for the initial pressure for T2 and D2(T) gases, respectively. The numerical process simulations identify the new issue between the SDS and the fuelling system (FS). It needs the guideline for the lower bound of the inlet pressure in the FS to reduce the tritium inventory in long tubes between the SDS and the FS and to optimize the operability of the SDS.

The scope of the present contribution is to report activities performed on the helium cooled lithium lead (HCLL) TBM, in its EM version for the H-H phase. This phase is characterized for the TBM by relevant D-T phase magnetic field, surface heat flux and disruption induced loads, and the lack of nuclear volumetric heating. On one hand. H-H phase gives the opportunity of experiments and use of instrumentation which will not be possible in the irradiated environment of D-T phase. On the other hand, H-H phase specificity is a temperature level in the breeder zone much lower than that in the D-T phase. Main EU objectives assigned to TBM testing in H-H phase for design validation and for the build-up of a reliability database can be fulfilled at this temperature level, which is not the case for the scientific experimental program (MUD, corrosion and tritium permeation). Hence, partial heating of the TBM is foreseen. A technical solution for an electrically heated configuration of the breeder zone has been investigated. Finite element (FE) analyses were performed to assess the thermal behaviour of the TBM for the non-heated and heated cases. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The objectives of this new design are (i) achievement of rapid hydrogen delivery performance on a ZrCo hydride bed, (ii) simplification of the bed internal configuration for manufacturing cost saving and (iii) improvement of operation reliability in 20 years operation of the nuclear fusion fuel cycles. The ZrCo bed composed of three trays was fabricated. ZrCo powder of 414 g per tray packed in thin wire mesh bags was placed on the surface of each tray.

Characterisation of a multitube PERMCAT reactor in view of a technical facility for highly tritiated water processing at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	26th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2010	Porto, PORTUGAL			Fuel cycle; Tritiated water; Catalytic membrane reactor; Palladium membrane	MEMBRANE REACTOR; SIMULATION; GAS	In the frame of the design and development of the Water Detritiation System (WDS) for ITER, the TRENTA facility was installed at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (ILK). This facility allows processing up to 1.7 kg h(-1) of tritiated water, it is however restricted to a maximum activity concentration of 3.7 x 10(11) Bq kg(-1). Because highly tritiated water (HTW) still is an issue for fusion technology, it is necessary to develop an additional process to decontaminate the highly tritiated part of the water waste stream. In order to provide a viable solution to process tritiated water in excess of 10(13) Bq kg(-1) an inactive experimental study was carried out to substantiate the design of an experimental facility based on a PERMCAT type catalytic palladium membrane reactor. A feasibility study was made to provide an outline design for an experimental plant to be used for parametric investigations with tritiated water of up to 5.2 x 10(16) Bq kg(-1). In parallel to experiments with a large technical PERMCAT using D(2)O and protium, a design study was made to define process steps and interfaces relevant for a technical scale experiment using a PERMCAT to decontaminate HTW at TLK.

However, beryllium nuclear data are differently presented in modern nuclear data evaluations. Recent investigations with the TRIPOLI-4 Monte Carlo simulation of the tritium breeding ratio (TBR) demonstrated that beryllium reaction data are the main source of the calculation uncertainties between ENDF/B-VII.0 and JEFF-3.1. To clarify the calculation uncertainties from data libraries on beryllium, in this study TRIPOLI-4 calculations of the Karlsruhe Neutron Transmission (KANT) experiment have been performed by using ENDF/B-VII.0 and new JEFF-3.1.1 data libraries. The KANT Experiment on beryllium has been used to validate neutron transport codes and nuclear data libraries. An elaborated KANT experiment benchmark has been compiled and published in the NEA/SINBAD database and it has been used as reference in the present work. The neutron multiplication in bulk beryllium assemblies was considered with a central D-T neutron source. Neutron leakage spectra through the 5, 10, and 17 cm thick spherical beryllium shells were calculated and five-group partial leakage multiplications were reported and discussed. In general, improved C/E ratios on neutron leakage multiplications have been obtained. Both ENDF/B-VII.0 and JEFF-3.1.1 beryllium data libraries of TRIPOLI-4 are acceptable now for fusion neutronics calculations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Evolution of beryllium pebbles (HIDOBE) in long term, high flux irradiation in the high flux reactor	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	26th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2010	Porto, PORTUGAL			Beryllium; HIDOBE; Irradiation; DEMO; HCPB		In the HIDOBE (High DOse irradiation of BEryllium) experiment, various grades of constrained and unconstrained beryllium pebbles, beryllium pellets and titanium-beryllide samples are irradiated in the high flux reactor (HFR) in Petten at four different temperatures (between 425 degrees C and 750 degrees C). The irradiation has been performed in a high flux position in order to obtain a DEMO relevant dpa-helium ratio. High dose irradiation testing is important because the beryllium irradiation behaviour, in particular its swelling and creep, has impact on, e.g. structural integrity of the breeder blanket and the tritium inventory and it is considered a critical issue for the HCPB concept for performance, safety and waste management. The first of two HIDOBE experiments, HIDOBE-01, has reached its irradiation target of 3000 appm He production after two years of irradiation and has been dismantled. The sample specimens have been retrieved and Post Irradiation Examination (PIE) has started on a selection of materials. This work presents the first observations of the material and preliminary results of material evolution (e.g., swelling, porosity/density changes, etc.) due to irradiation effects on different beryllium grades.

Although the conceptual design of a tritium-breeding blanket for SlimCS has been studied in the past several years, the structure of the previous blanket seems to be complex and difficult to manufacture from the viewpoint of engineering. In this paper, we proposed simplification of blanket structure without decreasing the net Tritium Breeding Ratio (TBR). In the proposed concept, the blanket is filled with the mixture of Li(4)SiO(4) pebbles or Li(2)O pebbles for the tritium breeding and Be(12)Ti pebbles for the neutron multiplication. To confirm the effectiveness of this concept, an ANIHEAT code with the nuclear library FENDL-2.0 was used for calculations of the neutronic and thermal analyses. The result indicated that, under the constraint of the blanket thickness being less than 0.5 m, the mixture of Li(2)O pebbles and Be(12)Ti ones is the most effective and that the TBR is expected to be greater than 1.05.

Development of pellet fuelling system in HL-2A tokamak	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	26th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2010	Porto, PORTUGAL			Pellet injection; Extrusion technology; HL-2A tokamak	STEADY-STATE PLASMA; TORE-SUPRA; CONFINEMENT; DISCHARGES	For increasing the plasma density and improving the plasma confinement, a new pellet fuelling system based on the extrusion technology has been developed successfully and set up in the low field side of the HL-2A tokamak. It is designed to produce 1-40 solid pellets of hydrogen/deuterium in one injection cycle. The pellet fuelling system consists of six main parts: (1) Vacuum system, which includes two independent sub-systems and can pump the corresponding spaces to 10(-3) Pa and below 10(-5) Pa, respectively. (2) A closed-cycle helium cryorefrigerator of 1 W power at 4.2K, which is used for cooling of the injector and pellet production. (3) A pellet size regulator, which is used for extrusion of ice ribbon with different dimensions. (4) Electromagnetic cutter, which is used to cut the ice ribbon to pellets with high frequency (up to 30 Hz). (5) Gas supply system, it can provide the pellet material of D(2) or H(2) and propellant gas of helium, and (6) control and diagnostic system. During our 2009-2010 experimental campaign, we made some commissioning tests for the fuelling system and injected the deuterium pellets into the plasma with the typical parameters as follows: pellet size are with the diameter = 1.3 mm and length = 1.3-1.7 mm, number of pellet N(p) = 3-5, frequency of injection F(i) = 10/20 Hz, velocity of pellet V(p) = 200-300 m/s by helium propellant gas with pressure of 0.6-1 MPa. The injection reliability is more than 90%. This paper will describe the new pellet fuelling system in detail, and present some preliminary injection experimental results in HL-2A tokamak.

Neutronic analysis of a dual He/LiPb coolant breeding blanket for DEMO	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	26th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2010	Porto, PORTUGAL			Blanket; Fusion; Neutronics; TBR; Shielding; Damage	ITER	A conceptual design of a DEMO fusion reactor is being developed under the Spanish Breeding Blanket Technology Programme: TECNO_FUS based on a He/LiPb dual coolant blanket as reference design option. The following issues have been analyzed to address the demonstration of the neutronic reliability of this conceptual blanket design: power amplification capacity of the blanket, tritium breeding capability for fuel self-sufficiency, power deposition due to nuclear heating in superconducting coils and material damage (dpa, gas production) to estimate the operational life of the steel-made structural components in the blanket and vacuum vessel (VV). In order to optimize the shielding of the coils different combinations of water and steel have been considered for the gap of the VV. The used neutron source is based on an axisymmetric 20 fusion reaction profile for the given plasma equilibrium configuration. MCNPX has been used for transport calculations and ACAB has been used to handle gas production and damage energy cross sections. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Catalan, J.

Determination of flow distribution in a HCLL blanket mock-up through electric potential measurements	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	26th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2010	Porto, PORTUGAL			Liquid-metal experiments; HCLL blanket; Electric potential; Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD); Average velocity		Magnetohydrodynamic experiments in a scaled mock-up of a helium-cooled lead lithium blanket module have been performed with the aim of determining the liquid-metal flow distribution inside breeder units and between sub-channels formed by the cooling plates. It has been observed that, even for strong magnetic fields, the distribution of the flow among these sub-channels is not completely uniform, i.e. inertial entrance and exit conditions still affect the flow partitioning in the breeder units. Moreover, depending on the balance between inertia, viscous and electromagnetic forces namely on Reynolds and Hartmann numbers, regions with almost stagnant or reversed flow can be observed.

A new combination of membranes and membrane reactors for improved tritium management in breeder blanket of fusion machines	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	26th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2010	Porto, PORTUGAL			ITER; Test blanket modules; Zeolite membrane; Palladium membrane; Catalytic membrane reactor	MECHANICAL DESIGN; ZEOLITE-MEMBRANES; PERMCAT REACTOR; GAS SEPARATION; ITER; RECOVERY; MODULES; SYSTEMS; DEMO	Tritium used as fuel in future fusion machines will be produced within the breeder blanket. The tritium extraction system recovers the tritium to be routed into the inner-fuel cycle of the machine. Accurate and precise tritium accountancy between both systems is mandatory to ensure a reliable operation. Handling in the blanket huge helium flow rates containing tritium as traces in molecular and oxide forms is challenging both for the process and the accountancy. Alternative tritium processes based on combinations of membranes and membrane reactors are proposed to facilitate the tritium management. The PERMCAT process is based on counter-current isotope swamping in a palladium membrane reactor. It allows recovering tritium efficiently from any chemical species. It produces a pure hydrogen stream enriched in tritium of advantage for integration upstream of the accountancy stage. A pre-separation and pre-concentration stage using new zeolite membranes has been studied to optimize the whole process. Such a combination could improve the tritium processes and facilitate accountancy in DEMO. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Test facility for a neutron flux spectrometer system based on the foil activation technique for neutronics experiments with the ITER TBM	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	26th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2010	Porto, PORTUGAL			TBM; Neutron generator; Activation foil spectrometer; Multi-foil		An important aim of neutronics Test Blanket Module experiments in ITER will be to check the prediction accuracy of nuclear responses in an environment more closely resembling a future fusion reactor than could be achieved so far with existing facilities. Quantities to be measured and checked are for example spectral neutron fluxes, tritium production rates, and nuclear heating. KIT, in cooperation with Technical University of Dresden (TUD), is developing a test measurement system with the goal to allow automated measurements of time profiles of spectral neutron fluxes by means of activation foil packages. The system is currently being installed at the Neutron Laboratory of TUD. In the present state, irradiation in the TBM is simulated with the intensive DT neutron generator of TUD, and a high-purity Ge-Detector is utilized for collecting the gamma-ray spectra of the activated foil packages. The test facility is flexible to explore also other types of gamma-ray detectors such as CdTe or CZT in future investigations which might be found better suited for the final system to be used with the TBM. First test measurements are underway with sets of activation foils which are based on well-established dosimetry reactions while extension to short-living radioisotopes is foreseen for future work (C) 2011 EURATOM.

For this reason activation detectors (foils) are planned to be used. The measurement circumstances, such as the irradiation time and the accessibility of the foils, highly depend on the detailed design of the TBMs and are not yet completely specified. Therefore, the flexible design requires an objective qualification method to select the optimal foil set for an actual experiment. The qualification method presented in this paper assigns a quality factor to each foil set. This factor depends on the orthogonality of the cross sections, the energy range covered by the foils and the discreteness of the energy range. A computer code has been developed to calculate the quality factor based on a calculated neutron spectrum and cross section data available in the nuclear data libraries. This study has been made in the framework of the Work Package No. 5 (measurement techniques development for breeder blankets) of the Breeding Blanket Developments for Fusion Reactors (EUROBREED) Goal Oriented Training Project supported by EFDA.

Such a high decontamination factor is achieved by multistage processes. The last stage of the three-step CAPER process developed at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK) is based on a so-called permeator catalyst (PERMCAT) reactor. The PERMCAT principle is based on isotopic swamping in a counter current mode. To support experiments, dynamic process simulation is indispensable for process design, analysis, and operation. A first numerical calculation code has been developed for the process simulation of PERMCAT. The numerical model developed was based on counter current one-dimensional plug flows partitioned with a membrane. In this study, the axial dispersion was newly taken into consideration to the numerical simulation code and its effect was examined. Improvement of the numerical simulation code considering a 2-dimensional model was developed and test calculations were carried out. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The aim of the work is to clarify the application of the used loading method for modeling of neutron irradiation from the point of view of tritium loading into beryllium samples with bulk uniformity. The formation of surface beryllium oxide layer on pebbles during the loading leads to limitation of tritium/hydrogen permeation into the loaded beryllium pebbles. The thickness of the oxide layers increases with the growth of loading temperature at the investigated temperature area. The optimal loading temperature for beryllium pebbles is supposed to be not higher than 973 K. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The chemical states of tritium were T(-) state and T(+) state. The abundance of T(-) state was increased in the temperature region of 400-500 K (Conversion I) and it was decreased above 500 K (Conversion II). These kinetic constants were determined. The kinetics of Conversion I and Conversion II was determined to be 7.79 exp(0.45 +/- 0.04 eV/kT)s(-1) and 8.53 x 10(4) exp(0.90 +/- 0.08 eV/kT)s(-1), respectively. The annealing kinetics of irradiation defects of F-centers (oxygen vacancy occupied by one electron), which was a major defect in neutron-irradiated Li(2)O, was also studied. Based on those experimental results, a comprehensive migration model for energetic tritium produced in lithium oxides including the dynamics of irradiation defects was proposed.

The annealing experiments showed that the amounts of E'-center and O-related defects which are the Frenkel pair decreased in the two temperature ranges of 300-400 and 550-650 K. The first and second stages were identified to reactions between E'-center and O--center and E'-center and O-2(-)-center, respectively. By comparing annihilation with formation behaviors of irradiation defects, it was revealed that the activation energy of annihilation for irradiation defects was influenced by the ratio of O-2(-)-center and O-related defects. Therefore, the annihilation process of irradiation defects was dominated by pyrolysis of O-2(-)-center. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

For lead-lithium eutectic, diverse technologies are currently being investigated and qualified. Permeator Against Vacuum (PAV) solution represents a firm candidate because: (i) runs as a single-step process for tritium on-line recovery, (ii) works passively allowing to be thermally governed, (iii) can be easily in-pipe integrated in Pb15.7Li loop systems and (iv) can be conceived with high compactness. An optimal design of a PAV requires a detailed hydraulic design optimization for established operational ranges. An optimal PAV design is proposed and qualified by numerical simulation.

Two experiments, Libretto 4/1 and 4/2, have been irradiated in HFR for 730 Full Power Days. The objective was to monitor on line the in-pile tritium production and permeation through Eurofer in contact with lead lithium eutectic. The irradiation of Libretto 4/1 and 4/2 has been conducted at 550 degrees C and 350 degrees C, respectively. Libretto 5 experiment has been irradiated for 520 Full Power Days in the temperature range of 300-500 degrees C with the objective to study tritium behavior in a lead lithium eutectic. The operation of the Libretto experiments included in-pile variations of hydrogen concentration in the purge gas and temperature transients. The irradiation of all three Libretto experiments has finished in 2009 and this work reports the analysis of the in-pile data. To analyze the data a model of tritium transport in lead lithium has been developed. The model incorporates two transport mechanisms: bulk diffusion and via rising tritium-helium bubbles. It was demonstrated that the bubble transport mechanism is much faster and in better agreement with the tritium residence times measured in the Libretto experiments. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

LIBRETTO-4: Understanding and modeling tritium transport under irradiation	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	26th Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT)	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2010	Porto, PORTUGAL			Breeder materials; Tritium; Permeation; Predictive transport modeling tools		LIBRETTO-4 irradiation experiment with in situ T production in eutectic alloy LiPb inside EUROFER97 capsules was performed at the High Flux Reactor (HFR), Petten. Two identical capsules at two temperature ranges (500-550 degrees C and 300-350 degrees C) tested the tritium permeation rate through pre-oxidized ferritic-martensitic EUROFER97 into a He + 1000 H(2) vppm cooling channel. A second channel with similar flowing gas composition obtained the tritium released from the LiPb and permeation through the internal wall of austenitic steel AISI316L. A 2-dimensional mathematical model has been developed. The model simulates tritium fluxes in capsule materials for variable experimental conditions (generation rates, gas pressures and flow rates) for a 27 days cycle. Modeling provides a consistent physical picture of release-rate mechanisms within the capsule. Tritium transport data under irradiation in capsule's material have been derived. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A remarkable feature of the code is a user-friendly graphical interface which allows to prepare an appropriate analysis model of a variety of blanket concepts with different materials in a short time. Furthermore, the code has a strong point that it provides the cross-sectional distribution of temperature, neutron/gamma fluxes, nuclear heating and tritium breeding ratio (TBR) inside the blanket after the completion of a single run. Throughout the DEMO design work in JAEA, it has proven that DOHEAT is extremely valuable in guiding the design study toward a wide variety of blanket concepts. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
