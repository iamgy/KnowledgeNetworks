J	Reisch, F				Reisch, Frigyes			HIGH PRESSURE BOILING WATER REACTOR	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						high pressure; boiling; water		Some 400 boiling water reactors (BWRs) and pressurized water reactors (PWRs) have been in operation for several decades. The presented concept, the high pressure boiling water reactor (HP-BWR), combines the best parts and omits the troublesome components of traditional BWRs and PWRs by taking into consideration the experiences gained during their operation. One of the major benefits of the HP-BWR is that safety is improved. The design utilizes gravity-operated control rods, and there is a large space for the cross-formed control rods between fuel boxes. The bottom of the reactor vessel is smooth and without penetrations. All the pipe connections to the reactor vessel are well above the top of the reactor core, and core spray is not needed. Additionally, internal circulation pumps are used. The HP-BWR concept is also environmentally friendly: Improved thermal efficiency is achieved by feeding the turbine with similar to 340 degrees C (15 MPa) steam instead of similar to 285 degrees C (7 MPa), and there is less warm water release to the recipient and less uranium consumption per produced kWh, resulting in the production of less waste. Finally, the HP-BWR is cost effective and simple, operating in direct cycle mode with no need for complicated steam generators. Moisture separators and steam dryers are placed inside the reactor vessel, and additional separators and dryers can be installed inside or outside the containment. Well-proved simple dry containment or wet containment can be used. In more than half a century, an extensive regulatory licensing experience has been built from traditional BWRs and PWRs. The HP-BWR is a developed, high-performance successor of those conventional designs. Therefore, it can be expected that licensing can be accomplished in a reasonable time. Several utilities are supporting manufacturers to study concepts for future reactors. It is likely that an application to one or more electrical power companies for financial support by a manufacturer to make a detailed feasibility study of the HP-BWR would be positively treated. This could be the next step to the implementation of the HP-BWR.

J	Uchikawa, S; Okubo, T; Nakano, Y				Uchikawa, Sadao; Okubo, Tsutomu; Nakano, Yoshihiro			FUEL ASSEMBLY DESIGN FOR PLUTONIUM CONSERVATION IN A LIGHT WATER REACTOR WITH HARD NEUTRON SPECTRUM	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						light water reactor; high conversion; fuel assembly design	RECYCLE	The FLWR is a boiling water reactor type with a core consisting of hexagonal-shaped fuel assemblies with a triangular-lattice fuel rod configuration, which has been proposed in order to ensure a sustainable energy supply in the future based on well-established light water reactor technologies. This paper proposes a new concept of fuel assembly design named FLWR/MIX. The first stage of FLWR is designed to conserve plutonium effectively with a fissile plutonium conversion ratio of around 1.0, keeping negative void reactivity characteristics. Enriched UO(2) fuel rods are arranged in the peripheral region of the assembly, surrounding the mixed oxide (MOX) fuel rods in the central region. Performance evaluation shows that the FLWR/MIX concept is effective for controlling the void reactivity characteristics in the tight-lattice fuel rod configuration and is promising under the framework of the UO(2) and MOX fuel technologies and related infrastructures that have been established for the current LWR-MOX utilization.

AN ANALYTICAL SIMULATION TO CALIBRATE GAMMA-RAY CYLINDRICAL DETECTORS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND RADIOACTIVE WASTE MEASUREMENTS	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						HPGe detectors; self-attenuation; coincidence summing corrections	COMPACT ANALYTICAL EXPRESSIONS; INCLUDING SELF-ABSORPTION; COINCIDENCE CORRECTIONS; EFFICIENCY; HPGE	The calibration of gamma-ray cylindrical detectors is often required in the analysis of high or low environmental samples and the homogenously distributive nuclear waste drums. Therefore, a new analytical simulation method is proposed in the present work to calculate the full-energy peak efficiencies of high-purity germanium cylindrical detectors using extended sources of low and high volumes. The sources were mounted at three different positions with respect to the detector's axis (coaxial, parallel, and perpendicular), labeled as Position 1, Position 2, and Position 3, respectively. The self-attenuation and the coincidence summing effects at low source-detector distance are also included in the algorithm. A remarkable agreement between the measured and the calculated efficiencies is achieved with discrepancies <4% for the first two positions and between 5 and 7% for the last one.

The first measurement of the neutron leakage spectra from a 10 x 10 x 5 cm pure uranium slab sample at 45 degrees and 135 degrees was reported. The experimental results were compared with the calculated ones by MCNP-4C simulation, using the evaluated data of uranium from the CENDL3.0, ENDF/B-VII and JENDL3.3 libraries. This work shows that the apparatus and the data processing procedures work well. And more experiments will be done in the future for benchmarking of the evaluated data, especially for the CENDL data.

J	Ikeda, K; Sekimoto, H				Ikeda, Kazumi; Sekimoto, Hiroshi			Nuclear mechanism for TRU burning oxide fueled core in Advanced Recycling Reactor	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Sodium cooled fast reactor; Transuranics; Sodium void reactivity; TRU transmutation; Advanced Recycling Reactor; GNEP		This paper presents an approximation approach to predict the core characteristics based on parametric survey and an analysis of nuclear mechanism in a conceptual nuclear design for enhanced transuranics (TRU) burning mixed oxide fueled and sodium cooled fast reactor which can be realized in the near future. The design study of Advanced Recycling Reactor was conducted in the context of the program for the industry in Global Nuclear Energy Partnership initiatives, including a core in the first plant for demonstration and cores with enhanced TRU burning capability for the future plants. Both concepts for the first plant; low core height and large volume fraction of structure are deployed, seeking small TRU conversion ratio (CR)* and small void reactivity which are crucial in the design, but different approaches. In this paper, the TRU CR and the sodium void reactivity have been approximated with a single equation in these concepts, based on the theoretical formula related to the chain reaction in the reactor and the calculation results. Shortening the core height and increasing the structure volume fraction will enhance TRU enrichment through increased neutron leakage and capture, which will reduce a ratio of U-238 to sum of Pu-239 and Pu-241 so that TRU CR decreases from 0.78 to 0.57. A small ratio of sodium loss to plutonium fissile will be effective also in the reduction of positive reactivity effect by spectral hardening. On the other hand, when this ratio and geometrical buckling of flux reduce, negative contribution by the neutron leakage becomes small. Theses relations related to the positive void reactivity have been formularized by the approximation with few parameters within several percent respectively as well as the TRU CR, indicating that one of dominating parameters is the ratio of sodium loss to plutonium fissile in the void reactivity at large fast reactors. * = (1 - net loss of TRU/loss of heavy metal).

J	Lafuente, A				Lafuente, A.			On the potential use of F2Be-molten-salt for hybrid reactors	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Breeder nuclear reactors; Void coefficient; Molten salts; Coolant selection; Hybrid reactors; Thorium cycle	HIGH-TEMPERATURE REACTOR; REACTIVITY COEFFICIENTS; FUEL; PERFORMANCE; PLUTONIUM; DESIGN; LIFE	Breeder reactors are considered a unique tool for fully exploiting natural nuclear resources. In current Light Water Reactors (LWR), only 0.5% of the primary energy contained in the nuclei removed from a mine is converted into useful heat. The rest remains in the depleted uranium or spent fuel. This evident need to improve resource-efficiency has stimulated interest in Fast-reactors, and with it, boosted the need to answer many of the remaining safety issues attached to such systems (i.e. coolant positive void coefficients). Among the existing candidates to overcome this fundamental drawback, the F2Be-molten-salt, has proved to feature outstanding neutronic properties. In previous studies, in an analysis that took into account requirements for criticality, for breeding, and for safety, it was demonstrated that a design window could be found in the definition of an F2Be-cooled system, where the safety requirement was met for a critical breeder reactor. In this paper we give a deeper insight on the neutronic features of F2Be coolant by comparing it with the moderator par excellence; light water. Its potential use on a thorium-fuel based system will be completed by a resilience analysis of the design window along the burn-up cycle. The ultimate goal is to give a sound answer to how a F2Be-cooled system could contribute to improve the resource-efficiency of nuclear systems without overlooking the main safety aspects. This is one of the main pending questions in the quest to sustainability. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Interpretation of the VENUS VIP-BWR program with APOLLO2.8 reference and optimized MOC schemes for 8 x 8 UO2 and MOX BWR assemblies	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						APOLLO2; BWR; JEFF3.1.1; Calculation scheme; Gadolinium; MOX	UNSTRUCTURED MESHES; ACCELERATION	The interpretation of the VIP-BWR program conducted in the CEN.SCK Mol VENUS critical facility (Belgium), has been performed with the new APOLLO2.8 product and its CEA2005V4.1 library based on the JEFF3.1.1 file. Both reference SHEM-MOC (281groups without equivalence) and Optimized BWR 26G (26 groups with equivalence) schemes are used for UO2 and MOX BWR assembly calculations. The VIP-BWR program was aimed to provide an experimental database for BWR neutronics tools in mixed Gd poisoned configurations with 8 x 8 UO2 and MOX assemblies. The experimental conditions are relatively representative of actual industrial BWR core characteristics, at least in terms of void fraction. Measured pin-by-pin power distributions enable to exact valuable information at various interfaces. For fresh (UO2/UO2-Gd) and recycled UO2 (UO2 only) cores loadings, the information is given through the "UO2" core. In the case of partial MOX loadings (UO2/MOX interface), the power distributions are available through the "T-MOX" core. All critical sizes are predicted within 1 with SHEM-MOC reference calculation scheme. For UO2 core, the (C-E) on keg are (95 +/- 266) pcm and (203 +/- 266) pcm for SHEM-MOC and Optimized scheme respectively. For MOX core, the results are (87 +/- 214) pcm and (283 +/- 214) pcm. The uncertainties take into account both measurement uncertainties and technological uncertainties such as enrichment, clad thicknesses, grid pitch or fuel densities. Average (C-E)/E on radial fission rate distributions are in excellent agreement in the UO2 and UO2-Gd assemblies. In mixed loading cores, the calculation shows an over prediction in the MOX fuel pin. This points out a systematic swing between UO2 and MOX. For average fission rates in UO2, the C/E results are within +/- 0.2% with SHEM-MOC and Optimized BWR 26G. For average power in MOX, the C/E results are within +/- 0.5% with SHEM-MOC and +/- 0.9% with Optimized BWR 26G. The P-MOX/PUO2 fission rate ratios are (+3.7 +/- 1.8%) and (+2.5 +/- 1.8%) for SHEM-MOC and Optimized BWR 26G respectively.

RECYCLING OF URANIUM FROM SPENT RBMK FUEL IN THE NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								It is shown that there is promise in using the uranium product obtained by reprocessing spent nuclear fuel from RBMK reactors as a non-initial fuel source for thermal reactors. A technical path for spent nuclear fuel from RBMK reactors is proposed: radiochemical reprocessing and obtaining oxides of recycled uranium. Oxides of the category RBMK-poor are packed and then stored in a near-surface storage facility; oxides of the category RBMK-rich are fluoridated, and UF(6) is fed into separation production for additional enrichment to the required content of (235)U. Additional advantages of recycled RBMK uranium as a source of non-initial (235)U are the low content of (232)U and the relatively low activity of spent fuel, which simplifies its reprocessing.

The systems are studied under equilibrium conditions, under which a constant distribution of fluorocarbons is established between the phases in a closed volume, and under nonequilibrium conditions created with stationary removal of the gas phase from the volume with liquid or solid uranium hexafluoride. The investigations were performed on specially prepared standard mixtures of uranium hexafluoride with fluorocarbon fraction from 10(-4) to 10(-1)%. The special features of the evaporation processes in the two-phase systems studied are shown, the distribution laws of the fluorocarbons between phases of the main substance are established, and the regimes of evaporation of the mixtures with the smallest disruptions in the uniformity of the fluorocarbon inflow with the flow of the evaporated uranium hexafluoride are determined.

MODELING THE DYNAMICS OF IODINE IN THE PROTECTIVE SHELL DURING ACCIDENTS IN NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS WITH VVER	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article								During a loss-of-coolant and core meltdown accident at a nuclear power plant fission products enter the atmosphere inside the protective shell. One of the main factors determining the effect on the environment, the dose loads in personnel and the general public in the first days after the accident is radioactive iodine. To evaluate the mass of the radioactive iodine entering the environment, it is necessary to calculate its concentration in the protective shell. The model developed to describe the dynamics of iodine and the computational module in the integrated code make it possible to perform numerical modeling of the behavior of iodine in the protective shell in the case of accidents at nuclear power plants with VVER reactors. The model makes it possible to take account of the effect of physicochemical processes on the formation of volatile forms of iodine as well as the dynamics of thermohydraulic parameters on the iodine distribution. Verification showed an adequate description of the dynamics of the volatile forms of iodine in the protective shell.	[Lebedev, L. E.; Bezlepkin, V. V.; Semashko, S. E.; Frolov, A.

INVESTIGATION OF AEROSOL KINETICS IN THE PROTECTIVE ENVELOPE WHEN ANALYZING ACCIDENTAL EMISSIONS AT NUCLEAR PLANTS	ATOMIC ENERGY			English	Article							COAGULATION; PARTICLES; EQUATIONS; DYNAMICS; GROWTH	The course of an unanticipated accident with serious damage to the core is characterized by the emission of a large quantity of radioactive materials into the first loop and then into the space inside the protective shell. The majority of the fission products enter the protective shell in the form of radioactive aerosols, whose leakage largely determines the consequences of a serious accident. This makes it necessary to model the dynamics of multicomponent aerosols taking account of the coagulation, change of their composition and mass as a result of the condensation-evaporation and dissolution of the gaseous components as well as the precipitation of the particles on different surfaces. A program for calculating the aerosol kinetic during the course of a serious accident is examined.	[Ivkov, I. M.; Zatevakhin, M. A.; Bezlepkin, V. V.; Semashko, S. E.; Ignatiev, A.

For the temporary storage site in Gremikha this is the preparation and removal of about 800 fuel assemblies and eight spent parts removed from Alpha class boats. The unsatisfactory state of the infrastructure and the sanitary-hygienic support on the object made it impossible remove the spent fuel immediately. Several years of work were needed to remove at the end of 2008, following the standard scheme, the first batch of 294 fuel assemblies for reprocessing at the Industrial Association Mayak. This was accomplished with the active and financial support of the French Atomic Energy Commission, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the European Commission (TACIS).

J	[Anonymous]				[Anonymous]			Uranium: Resources, Production, and Market-2009 Red Book	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								The "Red Book" has been compiled since the mid-1960s as a joint OECD/NEA and IAEA publication. The analysis presents an overview of present uranium supply and demand with perspectives reaching as far as 2035. Data from 35 countries were accumulated about exploration, resources, production, and prices. The 23(rd) edition contains the most recent basic evaluations of the world uranium market, providing a profile of nuclear fuel supply. Forecasts of nuclear generating capacity and uranium requirement for reactor use up until 2035 are presented along with a discussion of uranium supplies and aspects of demand beyond that time frame. Worldwide expenditures for the exploration of uranium resources in 2008 to-taled more than US$ 1.6 billion, which is a 133 % increase over expenses in 2006. Most of the important producer countries reported rising expenses for exploration as well as for commissioning new production centers. The total "identified" (=reasonably assured and inferred) reserves as of January 1, 2009 in the <$130/kg U (<$50/lb U(3)O(8)) category decreased slightly to 5,404,000 t U while a clear increase to 6,306,300 t U was seen in the re-introduced "high cost" category (<$260/kg U or <$100/lb U(3)O(8)). Uranium production in 2008 amounted to 43,880 t U, which is an increase of 6% over 2007 (41,244 t U), and of 11% over 2006 (39,617 t U). In 2008, worldwide uranium production (43,880 t U) covered roughly 74 % of the worldwide requirement for use in reactors (59,065 t U). The balance was met out of secondary sources.									0	0	0	0	4	INFORUM VERLAGS-VERWALTUNGSGESELLSCHAFT MBH	BERLIN	ROBERT-KOCH-PLATZ 4, BERLIN, 10115, GERMANY	1431-5254			ATW-INT J NUCL POWER	ATW-Int.

NSTX Res Team	Lithium coatings on NSTX plasma facing components and its effects on boundary control, core plasma performance, and operation	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						Lithium; Lithium wall fusion regime; Recycling; Plasma wall interactions; Divertors; Spherical torus	LIQUID LITHIUM; DIVERTOR; TOKAMAK	NSTX high power divertor plasma experiments have used in succession lithium pellet injection (LPI), evaporated lithium, and injected lithium powder to apply lithium coatings to graphite plasma facing components. In 2005, following the wall conditioning and LPI, discharges exhibited edge density reduction and performance improvements. Since 2006, first one, and now two lithium evaporators have been used routinely to evaporate lithium onto the lower divertor region at total rates of 10-70 mg/min for periods 5-10 min between discharges. Prior to each discharge, the evaporators are withdrawn behind shutters. Significant improvements in the performance of NBI heated divertor discharges resulting from these lithium depositions were observed. These evaporators are now used for more than 80% of NSTX discharges. Initial work with injecting fine lithium powder into the edge of NBI heated deuterium discharges yielded comparable changes in performance. Several operational issues encountered with lithium wall conditions, and the special procedures needed for vessel entry are discussed. The next step in this work is installation of a liquid lithium divertor surface on the outer part of the lower divertor. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Kugel, H. W.; Bell, M.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH DECOMMISSIONING THE CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR POWER PLANT COOLING POND	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						Cs-137; decontamination; dose assessment; environmental impact		Decommissioning of nuclear power plants and other nuclear fuel cycle facilities associated with residual radioactive contamination of their territories is an imperative issue. Significant problems may result from decommissioning of cooling ponds with residual radioactive contamination. The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (ChNPP) Cooling Pond is one of the largest self-contained water reservoirs in the Chernobyl region and Ukrainian and Belorussian Polesye region. The 1986 ChNPP Reactor Unit Number Four significantly contaminated the ChNPP Cooling Pond. The total radionuclide inventory in the ChNPP Cooling Pond bottom deposits are as follows: Cs-137: 16.28 +/- 2.59 TBq; Sr-90: 2.4 +/- 0.48 TBq; and Pu239+240: 0.00518 +/- 0.00148 TBq. The ChNPP Cooling Pond is inhabited by over 500 algae species and subspecies, over 200 invertebrate species, and 36 fish species. The total mass of the living organisms in the ChNPP Cooling Pond is estimated to range from about 60,000 to 100,000 tons. The territory adjacent to the ChNPP Cooling Pond attracts many birds and mammals (178 bird species and 47 mammal species were recorded in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone). This article describes several options for the ChNPP Cooling Pond decommissioning and environmental problems associated with its decommissioning. The article also provides assessments of the existing and potential exposure doses for the shoreline biota. For the 2008 conditions, the estimated total dose rate values were 11.4 40 mu Gy h(-1) for amphibians, 6.3 mu Gy h(-1) for birds, 15.1 mu Gy h(-1) for mammals, and 10.3 mu Gy h(-1) for reptiles, with the recommended maximum dose rate being equal to 40 mu Gy h(-1). However, drying the ChNPP Cooling Pond may increase the exposure doses to 94.5 mu Gy h(-1) for amphibians, 95.2 mu Gy h(-1) for birds, 284.0 mu Gy h(-1) for mammals, and 847.0 mu Gy h(-1) for reptiles. All of these anticipated dose rates exceed the recommended values. Health Phys. 99(5):639-648; 2010	[Farfan, E.

Aerosols were collected using a cascade impactor, and the amount of surrogate on each stage of the impactor was measured using neutron activation analysis. The aerodynamic mass median diameter of particles in the breathing zone of a worker was found to be 0.35 +/- 5.1 mu m. During a 2-h period when normal work activities were mimicked, an average of 3% of the material or 11.13 +/- 0.54 mu g escaped the hood. This was calculated to be equivalent to 10,000 +/- 487 Bq (Pu-239). The activity in the breathing zone of the worker is estimated, based on other research, to be 36 times less than this, or approximately 280 Bq. Worker occupancy factors were considered and a committed effective dose equivalent of 5 mSv was calculated. The cost-benefit analysis showed the use of the open front hood as a reasonable protective measure. Although worker exposure may approach the International Commission on Radiological Protection limit, the cost of the ergonomic injuries caused by work in a glove box is 5,000 times greater than the dose received by the worker. Protective measures such as respiratory protection should be evaluated on a case by case basis to keep worker exposure as low as reasonably achievable.

CHEMICAL AND RADIOACTIVE CARCINOGENS IN CIGARETTES: ASSOCIATED HEALTH IMPACTS AND RESPONSES OF THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY, U.S. CONGRESS, AND FEDERAL REGULATORY AGENCIES	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						cigarettes; carcinogenesis; health effects; Po-210	RADON; POLONIUM-210; SMOKE	Po-210 and Pb-210 were discovered in tobacco in 1964. This was followed by detailed assessments of the nature of their deposition, and accompanying dose rates to the lungs of cigarette smokers. Subsequent studies revealed: (1) the sources and pathways through which they gain access to tobacco; (2) the mechanisms through which they preferentially deposit in key segments of the bronchial epithelium; and (3) the fact that the accompanying alpha radiation plays a synergistic role in combination with the chemical carcinogens, to increase the fatal cancer risk coefficient in cigarette smokers by a factor of 8 to 25. Nonetheless, it was not until 2009 that Congress mandated that the Food and Drug Administration require that the cigarette industry reveal the presence of these carcinogens. In the meantime, cigarette smoking has become not only the number one source of cancer deaths in the United States, but also a major contributor to heart disease and other health impacts. If the latter effects are included, smoking is estimated to have caused an average of 443,000 deaths and 5.1 million years of potential life lost among the U.S. population each year from 2000 through 2004. The estimated associated collective dose is more than 36 times that to the workers at all the U.S. nuclear power plants, U.S. Department of Energy nuclear weapons facilities, and crews of all the vessels in the U.S. Nuclear Navy. This unnecessary source of lung cancer deaths demands the utmost attention of the radiation protection and public health professions.

The radiation protection section staffs should check the sources manually. Annual effective dose concerning stocktaking of them are estimated at some mSv concerning fingers. A radio frequency identification (RFID) tag's absorbed dose is estimated at some dozen Gy. RFID for stocktaking automatically was devised. Radiation effects on the communication performance of RFID tags were investigated by using response times and read ranges as indices. The RFID system was composed of a computer, a detector, and transponders (tag) consisting of an integrated circuit chip and an antenna. The tag is joined to the source for identification. The tags were irradiated at doses between 5 and 5,000 Gy by an x-ray irradiator. The response times and the read ranges were tracked from 40 to 23,200 min after irradiation. Relative read ranges fluctuated between 0.9 and 1.1 in the dose region less than 2,000 Gy, but fluctuated greatly in the dose region beyond 2,000 Gy. Malfunctioning tags appeared from 3,000 Gy, and all tags malfunctioned in the dose region over 4,500 Gy. The threshold dose leading to malfunction was determined to be 2,100 Gy. Time variation of relative read ranges was classified into four patterns. The pattern shifted from pattern 1 to 4 when the dose was increased. The relative read ranges lengthened in pattern 1. The relative read rages were approximately 1.0 in pattern 2. The read ranges tentatively shortened, then recovered in pattern 3. The tags malfunctioned in pattern 4. Once the tags malfunctioned, they never recovered their performance. Radiation enhances or deteriorates communication performance depending on dosage. Tags can spontaneously recover from radiation deterioration. The time variation of the read ranges can be illustrated by enhancement, deterioration, and recovery. The mechanism of four patterns is explained based on the variation of the frequency harmonization strength and activation voltage by irradiation. The annual effective dose of radiation protection section staffs can be reduced considerably.

Urine bioassay is one of the most commonly used methods for assessing radionuclide intake and radiation dose. This paper attempts to derive the sensitivity requirements (from inhalation exposure) for the urine bioassay techniques for the top 10 high-risk radionuclides that might be used in a terrorist attack. The requirements are based on a proposed reference dose to adults of 0.1 Sv (CED, committed effective dose). In addition, requirements related to sample turnaround time and field deployability of the assay techniques are also discussed. A review of currently available assay techniques summarized in this paper reveals that method development for Am-241, Ra-226, Pu-238, and Sr-90 urine bioassay is needed.

Natural radionuclides in fish species from surface water of Bagjata and Banduhurang uranium mining areas, East Singhbhum, Jharkhand, India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						fish; natural radionuclides; concentration factor; ingestion dose; excess lifetime cancer risk	RELATIVE IMPORTANCE; MARINE FOOD; PO-210; PB-210; ENVIRONMENT; ECOSYSTEM; LAKE; BIOAVAILABILITY; DIGESTION; SEDIMENTS	Purpose: To study the natural radionuclides in the freshwater fish samples around the uranium mining areas of Bagjata and Banduhurang, East Singhbhum, Jharkhand, India Materials and methods: The naturally occurring radioisotopes of uranium, U(nat), consisting of (234)U, (235)U and (238)U; (226)Ra, (230)Th and (210)Po were analysed in the fish samples from the surface water of Bagjata and Banduhurang mining areas after acid digestion. The ingestion dose, concentration factor and excess lifetime cancer risk of the radionuclides were estimated. Results: The geometric mean activity of U(nat), (226)Ra, (230)Th and (210)Po in the fish samples was found to be 0.05, 0.19, 0.29 and 0.95 Bq kg(-1) fresh (Becquerel per kilogram fresh fish), respectively, in the Bagjata mining area, while for Banduhurang mining area it was estimated to be 0.08, 0.41, 0.22 and 2.48 Bq kg(-1) fresh, respectively. The ingestion dose was computed to be 1.88 and 4.16 mu SvY(-1), respectively, for both the areas which is much below the 1 mSv limit set in the new International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) recommendations. The estimation of the Concentration Factors (CF) reveal that the CF from water is greater than 1 l/kg (1)in most of the cases while from sediment CF is less than 1. The excess individual lifetime cancer risk due to the consumption of fish was calculated to be 2.53 x 10(-5) and 6.48 x 10(-5), respectively, for Bagjata and Banduhurang areas, which is within the acceptable excess individual lifetime cancer risk value of 1 x 10(-4). Conclusion: The study confirms that current levels of radioactivity do not pose a significant radiological risk to freshwater fish consumers.

Utilities that operate these reactors need to quantify the ageing and the potential degradations of some essential structures of the power plant to ensure safe and reliable plant operation. So far, the material databases needed to take account of these degradations in the design and safe operation of installations mainly rely on long-term irradiation programs in test reactors as well as on mechanical or corrosion testing in specialized hot cells. Continuous progress in the physical understanding of the phenomena involved in irradiation damage and continuous progress in computer sciences have now made possible the development of multi-scale numerical tools able to simulate the effects of irradiation on materials microstructure. A first step towards this goal has been successfully reached through the development of the RPV-2 and Toughness Module numerical tools by the scientific community created around the FP6 PERFECT project. These tools allow to simulate irradiation effects on the constitutive behaviour of the reactor pressure vessel low alloy steel, and also on its failure properties. Relying on the existing PERFECT Roadmap, the 4 years Collaborative Project PERFORM 60 has mainly for objective to develop multi-scale tools aimed at predicting the combined effects of irradiation and corrosion on internals (austenitic stainless steels) and also to improve existing ones on RPV (bainitic steels). PERFORM 60 is based on two technical sub-projects: (i) RPV and (ii) internals. In addition to these technical sub-projects, the Users' Group and Training sub-project shall allow representatives of constructors, utilities, research organizations... from Europe, USA and Japan to receive the information and training to get their own appraisal on limits and potentialities of the developed tools. An important effort will also be made to teach young researchers in the field of materials' degradation. PERFORM 60 has officially started on March 1st, 2009 with 20 European organizations and Universities involved in the nuclear field. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

Sediments were sampled with grab corer at six locations in the Southeast Adriatic Sea. Rocks were collected on three islets in the Adriatic Sea. In the samples, natural radionuclides U-238, U-234, Th-232, Th-230, Ra-226 and Pb-210 were determined. After sampling and sample preparation, radiochemical separation procedures were applied. Then the samples were measured by alpha spectrometry system equipped with passivated implanted planar silicon detectors or by low background gas-flow proportional counter. Activity concentrations of natural radionuclides in samples were from 6.2 to 27.0 Bq/kg for U-238, from 7.9 to 28.1 Bq/kg for U-234, from 1.6 to 31.9 Bq/kg for Th-232, from 9.7 to 42.0 Bq/kg for Th-230, from 8.3 to 45.7 Bq/kg for Ra-226 and from 3.0 to 113.4 for Pb-210. The obtained values are discussed in detail and compared with results of similar investigations carried out elsewhere.

From 1 to 1.5 L of sample the nuclides were extracted and measured sequentially: the radium isotopes as well as Pb-210 were measured by liquid scintillation counting after separation on a membrane loaded with element-selective particles (Empore Radium Disks), Po-210 was determined by a-particle spectroscopy after spontaneous deposition onto a copper planchette and uranium was determined also by a-particle spectroscopy after anion separation and micro-precipitation with NdF3. The calculated committed effective doses for adults, teens and babies were compared to the total indicative dose of 0.1 mSv/year given in the EC Drinking Water Directive. The dominant portion of the committed effective dose was due to Ra-228. Highly mineralised waters showed also higher Ra-226 and Ra-228 levels.

Determination of Sr-90 in Portuguese foodstuffs	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th Radiochemical conference - RadChem	APR 18-23, 2010	Marianske Lazne, CZECH REPUBLIC			Sr-90 concentrations; Foodstuffs; Extraction chromatography; Liquid scintillation counting	RAPID-DETERMINATION; RADIOSTRONTIUM; SR-89	The Nuclear and Technological Institute (ITN) has the legal responsibility to carry out the environmental radiological monitoring at a national level. This survey was planned to provide relevant information on radioactivity levels in different components of the ecosystem. In what concerns the terrestrial environment the evaluation of the Sr-90 activity concentrations in foodstuffs has been performed using a method based on the separation of Sr-90 by extraction chromatography and beta determination by liquid scintillation counting (LSC) technique. The trials were carried out using 7 g of ash samples and 3 g of commercial Sr-resin (Eichrom). Validation trials were also performed using Sr-90 spiked samples. The chemical yields were determined by gravimetric method, after the addition of stable strontium to the foodstuffs. The Sr-90 activity concentrations in complete meals, meat and vegetables were determined after Y-90 ingrowths in the region 12-862 keV, using the Tri-Carb 3170 TR/SL scintillation counter in normal mode and a counting time of 120 min. The results obtained were low and of the same order of magnitude of those reported by other European countries.	[Lopes, I.; Madruga, M.

The river system consists of the Freiberger Mulde River and the Zwickauer Mulde River, which merge to form the Vereinigte Mulde River. The Zwickauer Mulde River drains the former uranium mining and milling areas in Saxony. This research project was established to quantify the long-term effect of the former uranium mining and milling activities by investigating the content of uranium of the water of the Mulde River. The activity concentration of uranium in samples from the Zwickauer Mulde River is still high compared with the natural background. The values measured in the water of the Vereinigte Mulde River are also elevated, but to a lesser extent due to the dilution effect caused by the merging with the uncontaminated Freiberger Mulde River. Furthermore, the level of contamination of the river water decreased by at least a factor of three as compared to the early 1990s.

Microorganisms were isolated from samples collected from the low-level radioactive waste repository within the confines of Ignalina NPP. Abilities of the fungi (Absidia spinosa var spinosa Lendn. and Paecilomyces lilacinus Thom Samson) as well as Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus mycoides and Micrococcus luteus) and Gram-negative bacterium I-m1 to transform the oxidation states of Pu under aerobic conditions were investigated. Oxidized and reduced Pu was tested using two radiochemical procedures. The amount of reduced and oxidized Pu was determined by measuring alpha activity after radiochemical separation. The results have shown that all bacteria and fungi can very slightly alter oxidation states of Pu due to their microbial activity. All the microorganisms tested demonstrate quite a fast process of Pu biosorption under the experimental conditions.

In the mass spectrometry sector, applications of Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICPMS) for the analysis of long-lived radionuclides in the environment are the most important recent achievements. These developments in both sectors did not only considerably decrease the detection limits for several radionuclides (up to several orders of magnitude), but they also enable to decrease sample volumes so that sampling, e. g. of the water column, can be much easier and more effective. Applications of radiometrics and mass spectrometry techniques in isotope oceanography, specifically on the distribution of H-3, C-14, Sr-90, I-129, Cs-137, Pu-239 and Pu-240 in the water column of the North Pacific and South Indian Oceans are presented and discussed.

Samples were selected randomly and were taken from different regions of Hungary (Balaton Upland, Bukk Mountain, Somogy Hills, Mezofold, and Lake Heviz). Concentration (mBq L-1) of U-234, U-235, and U-238 in the waters varied from 1.1 to 685.2, from <0.3 to 7.9, and from 0.8 to 231.6 respectively. In general, the highest uranium concentrations were measured in spring waters, while the lowest were found in tap waters. In most cases radioactive disequilibrium was observed between uranium isotopes (U-234 and U-238). The activity ratio between U-234 and U-238 varies from 0.57 to 4.97. The calculated doses for the analyzed samples of spring water are in the range 0.07-32.39 mu Sv year(-1) with an average 4.32 mu Sv year(-1). This is well below the 100 mu Sv year(-1) reference level of the committed effective dose recommended by WHO and the EU Council. The other naturally occurring alpha emitting radionuclides (Ra-226 and Po-210) will be analyzed later to complete the dose assessment. This study provides preliminary information for consumers and authorities about their internal radiological exposure risk due to annual intake of uranium isotopes via water consumption.

After the nuclear weapon tests the average deposition of Sr-90 in Austria amounted to 3.3 kBq/m(2). In 1986 the average deposition was 0.9 kBq/m2 [1]. To assess the actual condition in soil, grass and cereals Sr-90 was measured in these samples. For all samples oxalate precipitation was conducted and strontium specific columns (Eichrom Industries, Inc.) were used. The calcium concentration in these samples was determined to estimate the amount of resin needed for the preparation. For grass and cereal samples columns were packed with the 100-150 mu m resin to gain a lower limit of detection LLD below 2 and below 0.1 Bq/kg(dry matter) respectively. The prepacked 2 mL columns with particle size 100-150 mu m were used for soil (LLD below 2 Bq/kg(dry matter)). After digestion of soil samples, hydroxide precipitation was used as an additional separation step. The Sr-90 was measured by liquid scintillation counting. For quality control reasons, first the initial strontium concentration in the sample was determined then a strontium carrier solution was added and after the separation steps the chemical recovery was determined by ICP-MS. Thus, no radioactive tracer and just a small amount of the measuring solution were needed. The results are presented and discussed. These results will be used as reference for further Sr-90 analyses which will be conducted in a 5 year period to detect any radiological impact of the nuclear power plant Temelin on the environment of Austria.

Selected minor and trace elements from water bodies of western Paraguay	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th Radiochemical conference - RadChem	APR 18-23, 2010	Marianske Lazne, CZECH REPUBLIC			Bottom sediments; Western Paraguay; Chaco rivers; XRF; Refractory elements; LREE; Andean; Denudation; Recycled	PROVENANCE	Minor and trace elements composition of bottom sediments from water bodies in Western Paraguay have been investigated by XRF techniques to determine their correlation as well as provenance. The analysis of complex spectra was performed by the AXIL software and the quantitative analysis by the QAES software. Analyzed trace elements were the refractory elements Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Zr, y and other HFSE as Cr, Ni, Cu, together with Zn. Minor elements were Ti, Mn, Fe which are often to the above refractories related. According to their normalized spidergrams two sets of sediments can be differentiated. Those from Pilcomayo and Verde rivers as well as from km164-Wetland show light rare earth elements (LREE) enrichment, negative Nb and Ti anomalies and no spike at Zr. On the other hand, sediments from Confuso, Aguaray(Jehe), Negro and Montelindo rivers have spidergrams very alike, with strong negative anomalies at Nb, Nd and Ti whereas a positive at Zr. Further, in the former there is a strong correlation of Fe versus the refractory elements; such a correlation does not exist in the latter. The sediments from the Pilcomayo & Verde Rivers and from the km164-Wetland evolved as the sub-Andean/Andean metamorphic/sedimentary materials.	[Facetti-Masulli, J.

Both radionuclides are preconcentrated from 0.5 dm(3) saline media by co-precipitation with hydrated manganese dioxide, followed by dissolution of the precipitate in 200 mL of 1 M HCl. Uranium isotopes U-235 and U-238 can be directly determined by ICP MS method with a detection limit of 0.01 ppb for U-238. Prior to a selective determination of Po-210, the majority of other naturally occurring a-emitting radionuclides (uranium, thorium and protactinium) can be stripped from this solution by their extraction with a 50% solution of HDEHP in toluene. Finally, Po-210 is simply separated by direct transfer to an extractive scintillator containing 5% of trioctylphosphine oxide in Ultima Gold F cocktail and determined by an alpha/beta separation liquid scintillation technique with detection limit below 0.1 mBq/dm(3)	[Grabowski, Pawel; Bem, Henryk] Tech Univ Lodz, Dept Chem, PL-90924 Lodz, Poland	Bem, H (reprint author), Tech Univ Lodz, Dept Chem, Zeromskiego St 116, PL-90924 Lodz, Poland.	henrybem@p.lodz.pl					BAKIR YY, 1994, APPL PULSE DECAY DIS; Becker JS, 2005, INT J MASS SPECTROM, V242, P183, DOI 10.1016/j.ijms.2004.11.009; Bem H, 2004, NUKLEONIKA, V49, P1; Bem H, 2004, ENVIRON INT, V30, P123, DOI 10.1016/S0160-4120(03)00151-X; Bem H, 1998, NUKLEONIKA, V43, P459; Chau ND, 2009, J RADIOANAL NUCL CH, V279, P121, DOI 10.1007/s10967-007-7276-6; Desideri D, 2007, J ENVIRON RADIOACTIV, V94, P86, DOI 10.1016/j.jenvrad.2007.01.005; Eikenberg J, 2001, J ENVIRON RADIOACTIV, V54, P109, DOI 10.1016/S0265-931X(00)00170-3; Harrison J, 2007, J RADIOL PROT, V27, P17, DOI 10.1088/0952-4746/27/1/001; Hossain MMM, 2002, J RADIOANAL NUCL CH, V251, P333, DOI 10.1023/A:1014897101149; Hou XL, 2008, ANAL CHIM ACTA, V608, P105, DOI 10.1016/j.aca.2007.12.012; Jia GG, 2004, APPL RADIAT ISOTOPES, V61, P279, DOI 10.1016/j.apradiso.2004.03.021; Jia GG, 2000, APPL RADIAT ISOTOPES, V53, P115, DOI 10.1016/S0969-8043(00)00121-4; Jia GG, 2008, APPL RADIAT ISOTOPES, V66, P1478, DOI 10.1016/j.apradiso.2008.03.015; Kohler M, 2002, APPL RADIAT ISOTOPES, V56, P387, DOI 10.1016/S0969-8043(01)00219-6; KOZLOWSKA B, 2007, GEOCHIM COSMOCHIM AC, V42, P1380; LANGMUIR D, 1978, GEOCHIM COSMOCHIM AC, V42, P547, DOI 10.1016/0016-7037(78)90001-7; MATTHEWS KM, 2007, APPL RADIAT ISOTOPES, V65, P207; Pawlak Z, 2002, ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL, V36, P5395, DOI 10.1021/es020632g; Rathore DPS, 2008, TALANTA, V77, P9, DOI 10.1016/j.talanta.2008.06.019; Rodriguez MB, 2000, APPL RADIAT ISOTOPES, V52, P705, DOI 10.1016/S0969-8043(99)00233-X; SALONEN L, 1993, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V130, P23, DOI 10.1016/0048-9697(93)90056-C; Skwarzec B, 2003, J RADIOANAL NUCL CH, V256, P361, DOI 10.1023/A:1023970308882; Skwarzec B, 2006, NUKLEONIKA, V51, pS45; Stepnowski P, 2000, J ENVIRON RADIOACTIV, V49, P201, DOI 10.1016/S0265-931X(99)00094-6; Theng TEL, 2005, J ENVIRON RADIOACTIV, V80, P273, DOI 10.1016/j.jenvrad.2004.10.004; *UN ENV PROGR, 2003, DEPL UR BOSN HERZ PO, P88; UNESCAR, 2000, SOURC EFF RISKS ION; *US EPA, 2002, RAD DRINK WAT SMALL, P4; Varga Z, 2007, APPL RADIAT ISOTOPES, V65, P1095, DOI 10.1016/j.apradiso.2007.05.001; Veronneau C, 2000, ANAL CHIM ACTA, V415, P229, DOI 10.1016/S0003-2670(00)00859-X; Vesterbacka P, 2005, 238U SERIES RADIONUC; Wallner G, 2008, J ENVIRON RADIOACTIV, V99, P1090, DOI 10.1016/j.jenvrad.2007.12.021; World Health Organization, 2006, GUID DRINK WAT QUAL, V1	34	0	0	1	14	SPRINGER	DORDRECHT	VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS	0236-5731	1588-2780		J RADIOANAL NUCL CH	J.

For CPE, tributyl phosphate (TBP) is used as the complexing agent and (1,1,3,3-Tetramethylbutyl) phenyl-polyethylene glycol (Triton X-114) as the surfactant. The measurement is performed after phase separation by mixing of the surfactant phase with the liquid scintillation cocktail. The effect of experimental conditions such as pH, reactant ratio (e. g. m(TBP)/m(Triton), ionic strength (e. g. [NaCl]) and the presence of other chemical species (e. g. Ca2+ and Fe3+ ions as well as humic acid and silica colloids) on CPE has been investigated. According to the experimental results the total method efficiency is (13 +/- 2)% and the chemical recovery (50 +/- 10)% at pH 4 and reactant ratio (V(TBP)/V(Triton) = 0.1). Regarding the other parameters, generally Ca2+ and Fe3+ ions as well as the presence of colloidal species in solution (even at low concentrations) results in significant decrease of the chemical recovery of uranium. On the other hand increasing NaCl concentration leads to enhancement of chemical recovery. The detection limit under optimum experimental conditions has been found to be 0.5 Bq L-1 indicating that the method could be applied only to waters samples with increased uranium concentration. Moreover, the negative effect of the chemical species found in natural waters limits the applicability of the method with the respect to environmental radioactivity measurements.

The investigation was performed to evaluate the applicability of cation exchange as separation and pre-concentration method prior to the radiometric analysis of uranium and plutonium isotopes in natural water samples. Application of the method to test solutions of constant radionuclide concentration and variable composition (0.1, 0.5 and 1 M NaCl; 0.1 and 0.5 M Ca(NO3)(2); 0.1 and 1 mM FeCl3; 10) has generally shown that: (1) the optimum pH is 4.5 for uranium and plutonium, (2) increasing salinity results in slightly lower for uranium and significantly higher chemical recovery plutonium and (3) the presence of Ca(II) cations doesn't significantly affect the chemical recovery of both radionuclides. Contrary, the presence of Fe(III) cations ([Fe(III)] > 0.1 mM) results in significantly lower chemical recovery for both radionuclides (<50%). The later is attributed to the formation of Fe(III) colloids, which present increased chemical affinity for uranium and plutonium and hence compete with the radionuclide binding by the resin. Nevertheless, the results indicate that the method could be successfully applied to a wide range of natural waters.

This method appears suitable for fast determination of activity of radionuclides due to direct alpha and beta separation, measurement in 4 pi geometry and without sample treatment. The selected group of radionuclides was chosen with respect to military significance, radiotoxicity, and possibility of potential misuse. Sr-90 and Pu-239 were selected as model radionuclides. Three types of filters were examined, and the attention was also focused on optimizing the type and volume of LSC cocktail. The efficiencies for Pu-239 and Sr-90 were 90% and 79%, respectively. This method was the most effective for the glass fiber filters measured with the MaxiLight cocktail.

Radioanalytical determination of actinoids in refractory matrices by alkali fusion	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th Radiochemical conference - RadChem	APR 18-23, 2010	Marianske Lazne, CZECH REPUBLIC			Uranium; Thorium; Alkali fusion; Alpha spectrometry	SPECTROMETRY; TITANIUM; THORIUM; URANIUM; SAMPLES	In this work a method used conventionally for ICP-MS measurements have been modified and readapted for the determination of actinides (U and Th isotopes) in refractory samples by alpha-spectrometry. The method is based in a total dissolution of the sample by alkali fusion. In the first stages of our studies, we try to digest refractory samples by leaching with aqua regia followed by the application of a liquid-liquid solvent extraction process for the sequential isolation of the uranium and thorium isotopes from the dissolved fraction. These actinides were finally electroplated in stainless steel discs and measured in an alpha-spectrometer using PIPS detectors. On the other hand, gamma measurements were carried out in aliquots of the same samples in order to check the results produced by alpha spectrometry. Clear disagreements were found between the results obtained by both techniques. This problem was solved by the application of an alkali fusion technique where a total dissolution of the sample is performed. It was found in addition that the alkali fusion is easily applicable, less time-consuming, needs less reagents than leaching and it does not require sophisticated apparatus to be executed. In this paper the whole procedure for U and Th determination in refractory samples by alphaspectrometry with alkali fusion is presented and validated.

Cereals are an obvious choice as primary vehicles for food-supplementation programs, especially in countries where they definitely weigh in the dietary intake (like Portugal), and regions whose geographical and/or pedological features may account for nutrient deficiencies in typical diets. Mature rye plants (Secale cereale L.; roots and grains) and local soils were collected in the summer of 2009 from two regions of northern Portugal, and put through k(0)-standardized, instrumental neutron activation analysis (k(0)-INAA). Overall, the results (elemental concentrations, enrichment factors, transfer coefficients) seem to confirm an efficient uptake of elements from soil and their translocation to the aerial parts of the plants, notably to the ones that really matter in human nutrition (grains).

Source term evaluation for the upgraded LEU Pakistan Research Reactor-1 under severe accidents	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							REACTIVITY; CORE; MTR; HEU; PARAMETERS; INVENTORY; OPERATION; RELEASE; FUELS; POWER	Evaluation of source term has been carried out for the upgraded LEU PARR-I system taken as a typical material test reactor (MTR). The modeling and simulation of release of radioactivity has been carried out by developing a Matlab based computer program which uses the ORIGEN2 code for core inventory calculations. For post 180 full-power days continuous operation, various accident scenarios, with instantaneous release of radioactivity to containment, have been considered including the startup, fuel loading, and loss-of-coolant accidents. For noble gases, iodine and for aerosols, the release rate studies have been carried out for the normal, emergency and for the isolation states of containment. The values of source term as well as that of containment retention factor show rapid increase followed by an approach towards saturation values as the exhaust rate values are increased. The isotope-dependency of the containment retention factor has been studied and the results indicate strong sensitivity for (85)Kr, (137)Xe, (138)Xe and (138)Cs towards exhaust rate values.

Development of a real-time detection strategy for process monitoring during nuclear fuel reprocessing using the UREX+3a method	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								Reprocessing nuclear fuel is becoming more viable in the United States due to the anticipated increase in construction of nuclear power plants, the growing stockpile of existing used nuclear fuel, and a public desire to reduce the amount of this fuel. A new reprocessing facility will likely have state of the art controls and monitoring methods to safeguard special nuclear materials, as well as to provide real-time monitoring for process control. The focus of this research was to create a proof of concept to enable the development of a detection strategy that uses well established gamma and neutron measurement methods to characterize samples from the Uranium Extraction Plus 3a (UREX+3a) reprocessing method using a variety of detector types and measurement times. A facility that implemented real-time gamma detection equipment could improve product quality control and provide additional benefits, such as waste volume reduction. In addition to the spectral analyses, it was determined by Monte Carlo N Particle (MCNP) simulations that there is no noticeable self-shielding for internal pipe diameters less than 5.08 cm, indicating that no self-shielding correction factors are needed. Further, it was determined that High Purity Germanium (HPGe) N-type detectors have the high gamma ray energy resolution and neutron damage resistance that would be required in a reprocessing facility. Finally, the gamma ray spectra for the measured samples were simulated using MCNP and then the model was extended to predict the responses from an actual reprocessing scenario from UREX+3a applied to fuel that had a decay time of 3 years. The 3-year decayed fuel was more representative of commercially reprocessed fuel than the acquired UREX+3a samples. It was determined that the 3-year decayed fuel is easier to apply real-time process monitoring due to an increased number of short lived detectable isotopes. This research found that real-time gamma ray detection for process monitoring would be beneficial to a reprocessing facility and that commercially available detectors may be adequate for the neutron environment.

It is crucial to accurately and efficiently detect the charged decay particles, in the high-density particle environment of the LHC. For this, the Outer Tracker (OT) was constructed, consisting of similar to 55,000 straw tubes, covering in total an area of 360 m(2) of double layers. The detector is foreseen to operate under large particle rates, up to 100 kHz/cm per straw in the region closest to the beam. The front-end electronics is expected to provide the precise (0.5 ns) drift-time measurement, at an average occupancy of 5% and at 1 MHz trigger rate. The tracking procedure requires high-efficiency (low thresholds), while at the same time putting stringent limits on the noise level. The modular detector structure reflects on the FE electronics: 128 channels are read out by one FE Box. During installation, the dark current, the response to radioactive sources, and the gas-tightness of all detector units was checked and only a handful of bad channels were found. Special hardware and dedicated procedures, integrated within the experimental control system, have been designed for the detector calibration during data taking. At the time of the conference, the detector has been installed and commissioned with the help of cosmic rays events producing tracks through OT. During the first days of the LHC commissioning, the detector was operated on nominal voltage and large-multiplicity events originating at the circulating beam were recorded and studied.

The system is able to operate with different types (p- and n-type) and different sizes (up to 3 cm(2)) of microstrip silicon sensors, both irradiated and non-irradiated. Heavily irradiated sensors will be used at the Super Large Hadron Collider, so this system can be used to research the performance of microstrip silicon sensors in conditions as similar as possible to the Super Large Hadron Collider operating conditions. The system has two main parts: a hardware part and a software part. The hardware part acquires the sensor signals either from external trigger inputs, in case of a radioactive source setup is used, or from a synchronised trigger output generated by the system, if a laser setup is used. The software controls the system and processes the data acquired from the sensors in order to store it in an adequate format. The main characteristics of the system are described. Results of measurements acquired with n- and p-type detectors using both the laser and the radioactive source setup are also presented and discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The biasing resistors are made of p-doped polysilicons and the coupling capacitors are built by separating implanted strips and readout strips by a thin oxide layer. The p-stops in the atoll patterns are introduced to disrupt an electron accumulation layer at the Si-SiO(2) interface on the ohmic side. The junction side has a double metal structure using two metal layers separated from each other by a thick insulator layer. The strip sensors are fabricated on a 5-in., high resistivity, < 100 >-orientation, and 380 mu m thick n-type double-sided polished silicon wafer. The prototype sensor with an area of 2.8 x 2.8 cm(2) consists of 256(512) readout channels with a strip pitch of 100(50) mu m. The leakage currents and the bulk capacitances as a function of the reverse bias voltage are measured to understand the fabrication process of the prototype sensors. The signal to noise ratios are measured by using a (90)Sr radioactive source in order to evaluate performance of the sensors. The design of the AC-coupled double-sided silicon strip sensor and its various components are described, and measurements of the electric characteristics and the signal to noise ratio are presented.

The baseline design uses (82)Se as the source. A sensitivity to a ov beta beta half-life greater than 10(26) years can be reached giving access to Majorana neutrino masses of 50-100 meV. SuperNEMO sensitivity is dependent upon the calorimeter parameters such as energy and time resolution, radio-purity and aging. One of the main challenges of the SuperNEMO project is the development of the calorimeter. This calls for an unprecedented energy resolution for plastic scintillators of 4% FWHM at 3 MeV (Q(beta beta) value of (82)Se) and radio-purity. The collaboration is carrying out a broad R&D programme focusing on the development of liquid and solid scintillators and ultralow radioactive highly efficient photo-detectors. Extensive laboratory measurements are complimented by the most up-to-date Monte Carlo optical simulations using GEANT4. In parallel an alternative design for SuperNEMO using 2 m scintillator bars as the calorimeter is being investigated and is also discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
