In many cases the technologies required to manufacture these components are well established, in others there is still ongoing design and R&D work to select and optimise the final design solutions and to consolidate the underlying technologies as, for example, in the areas of heating and current drive, plasma diagnostics, shield blanket and first wall, remote handling, etc. A design review has recently been conducted by the ITER Organisation, with the support of the Domestic Agencies (DAs) established by the countries participating to ITER, to address the remaining outstanding technical issues and understand the associated implications for design, machine performance, schedule and cost. This paper provides an update of the design and technical status of EU contributions to ITER. (C) 2009 Maurizio Gasparotto. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Development of key ITER relevant technologies on the Tore Supra tokamak	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	25th Symposium on Fusion Technology	SEP 15-19, 2008	Rostock, GERMANY	Max Planck Inst Plasmaptys		Tokamak; Long pulse; Plasma facing components; RF heating; Real time	HEAT-FLUX; RETENTION; PROJECT; POWER	As the largest superconducting tokamak presently in operation, with all plasma facing components (PFC) actively cooled, Tore Supra is able to routinely address critical issues of high power long duration discharges. Twenty years of operation of Tore Supra have been valorised through "lessons learnt" studies on systems critical for long pulse operation. Real time feedback systems have been developed to safely operate at a high level (>10 MW) of injected power. The versatility of the integrated plasma controller has allowed extending feedbacks to plasma performance optimisation. A dedicated long discharges campaign, cumulating 5 h of plasma in 10 operation days without any conditioning procedure meanwhile, has allowed to gain new insights in deuterium retention studies and to reveal a new operational limit characterised by a progressive decreases of the power handling capability. A strong development effort has been undertaken to follow up the PFC ageing during and between experimental campaigns. This includes the development of an articulated inspection arm, of lock-in thermography and confocal microscopy techniques. An important part of the Tore Supra programme, is the development of reliable heating and current drive systems. Progress in the development of lower hybrid couplers, klystrons and test of a load resilient ion cyclotron range of frequency are reported. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Gruber, O				Gruber, O.			ASDEX Upgrade enhancements in view of ITER application	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	25th Symposium on Fusion Technology	SEP 15-19, 2008	Rostock, GERMANY	Max Planck Inst Plasmaptys		Tokamaks; ITER; ASDEX Upgrade; Tungsten wall; Advanced scenarios; MHD control; Current drive; Edge Localized Modes	SCENARIO; TOKAMAK	The aim of the ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) programme is to support the design, prepare the physics base and develop regimes beyond the baseline of ITER and for DEMO. Its ITER-like geometry, poloidal field system, versatile heating system and power fluxes make AUG particularly suited. After the transition to fully tungsten coated plasma facing components AUG could be operated without prior boronizations and a low permanent deuterium retention was found qualifying W as wall material. ITER-like baseline H-modes (H98 similar to 1, beta(N) similar to 2) were routinely achieved up to 1.2 MA plasma currents. W concentrations could be kept at an acceptable level of <5 x 10(-5) by central wave heating (enhancing impurity outward transport) and ELM pacing with gas puffing. The compatibility of high performance improved H-modes, the ITER hybrid scenario, with all un-boronized W wall was demonstrated achieving H(98) similar to 1.1 and beta(N) up to 2.6 at modest triangularities delta <= 0.3. This performance is reached despite the gas Puffing needed for W influx control. Increasing delta to 0.35 allowed at even higher puff rates still a H(98) similar to 1.1. Reliable plasma operation in support of ITER comprised the demonstration of ECRF assisted low voltage plasma Start-up and current rise at toroidal electric fields below 0.3 V/m resulting in a ITER compatible range of plasma internal inductance of 0.71-0.97. Disruption mitigation is feasible using strong gas puffs, and the achieved electron densities approach values needed for runaway Suppression. Present hardware extensions in support of ITER include file upgrading of ECRH by a 4 MW/10s system with large deposition variability (tuneable frequency between 105 and 140 GHz, real-time steerable mirrors) for central heating and MHD mode control. A powerful system of 24 in-vessel coils produces error fields up to toroidal mode number n = 4 for ELM suppression and mode rotation control. In connection with a close conducting wall they will open up the road for RWM stabilization in advanced scenarios. For those we are considering LHCD for current drive and profile control With Up to 500 kA driven Current. The tungsten sources are dominated by Sputtering from intrinsic light impurities, and the W influx from the outboard limiters are the main source for the core plasma. ICRH induced electric fields accelerate light impurities, restricting the use of ICRH to just after boronization. 4-strap antennas imbedded in extended wall structures might solve this problem. Finally, doubling the plasma Volume with plasma currents above 2 MA in AUG Could be the solution for a needed ITER satellite. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Efficiency and availability driven R&D issues for DEMO	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	25th Symposium on Fusion Technology	SEP 15-19, 2008	Rostock, GERMANY	Max Planck Inst Plasmaptys		DEMO; Efficiency; Availability; Materials; Tokamak operation; Heating and current drive	BEAM INJECTION SYSTEM; MARTENSITIC STEELS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; TRANSPORT BARRIER; BOOTSTRAP CURRENT; FUSION POWER; HIGH-BETA; IRRADIATION; DIVERTOR; TOKAMAKS	DEMO is the main step foreseen after ITER to demonstrate the technological and commercial viability of a fusion power plant. DEMO R&D requirements are usually identified on the basis of the functions expected from each individual system. An approach based on the analysis of overall plant functional requirements sheds new light on R&D needs. The analysis presented here focuses on two overall functional requirements, efficiency and availability. The results of this analysis are presented here putting emphasis on systems not sufficiently considered up to now, e.g. the hearing and current drive systems, while more commonly addressed systems such as tritium breeding blankets are not discussed in detail. It is also concluded that an overall functional analysis should be adopted very early in the DEMO conceptual design studies in order to provide a fully integrated approach, which is an absolute requirement to ensure that the ambitious goals of this device will be ultimately met.

This paper presents the progress in compatibility experiments with liquid LiPb achieved up to now in China for some candidate structural materials. The results showed that CLAM steel had good compatibility with flowing LiPb at 480 degrees C with the velocity of 0.08 m/s after 5000 h in DRAGON-I loop. On the other hand, after exposed in static LiPb at 700 degrees C for 500 h in a SiC crucible, the W and Mo specimens suffered much more weight loss compared with Nb specimen, and a thin reaction product layer was visible on the surface of all the three refractory metals. Preliminary analysis on SiC(f)/SiC composite specimens indicated that there was no penetration of LiPb and no reaction products on the surface with CVD SiC coating, which showed SiCf/SiC composite were stable and compatible with static LiPb under 700 degrees C after 500h exposure.

The aim of the project is to deliver by June 2013 the complete engineering design file of this major facility. This engineering design will be validated by the design. the construction and the operation of three prototypes representative of the main challenging systems of IFMIF: The low energy part of the accelerator (up to 9 MeV), tested at full Current (125 mA) in continuous wave at Rokkasho, Japan. The lithium target at a scale 1/3, including all purification (hot and cold traps) and monitoring systems foreseen for IFMIF, and tested at Oarai, Japan. The high flux test module's main components, with in particular the irradiation of scale 1:1 rigs and thermo-hydraulic demonstration of the modules, tested in Europe. The main outcomes 1 year after the start of the project are: The accelerator main subsystems (radiofrequency quadrupole and drift tube linac) are being optimized and have improved characteristics compared to those described in the Comprehensive Design Report, initial base of the work; in particular, the high energy drift tube linac (accelerating the beam from 5 to 40 MeV) is now a superconducting half wave resonator structure. As a result of recent experimental work, the shape of the backplate has now very smooth variation of curvature radii to drastically reduce the risks of flow instabilities. An important preparatory experimental work is being conducted to assess the purification conditions and minimize erosion and corrosion by lithium of the loop components. The Test Cell, hosting the modules is under major revision. Thermo-mechanical and hydraulic calculations also led to changes in the test facilities and their high flux test module.

Neutronics design analyses of fusion power reactors based on a novel integral approach	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	25th Symposium on Fusion Technology	SEP 15-19, 2008	Rostock, GERMANY	Max Planck Inst Plasmaptys		Fusion; Power reactor; Neutronics; Monte Carlo; CAD	BLANKET DESIGN; PLANT	A novel integral approach was applied for the nuclear design analyses performed for the European DEMO Conceptual Study including, for the first time, the automatic generation of analysis models for Monte Carlo calculations from available CAD geometry data by the new McCad conversion tool. Starting from neutronics pre-analyses to define the radial reactor build, a generic neutronics CAD model of the DEMO reactor was constructed serving as basis for the generation of DEMO reactor models employing the HCLL (Helium Cooled Lithium Lead) and HCPB (Helium Cooled Pebble Bed) blankets for the tritium breeding and the power production. The HCLL and HCPB DEMO reactor models were converted to the MCNP geometry representation by the newly developed McCad software tool, The nuclear analyses performed on the basis of MCNP Monte Carlo calculations using the converted models showed that both DEMO reactor variants could satisfy the requirements for a sufficient shielding and tritium breeding performance. As a major outcome of this work it is concluded that the newly established integral approach for neutronics analyses, including the automatic generation of analysis geometry models by McCad, is mature for applications to reactor design analyses and studies.

Both the test blanket modules (TBMs) box design and the associated systems (Helium Cooling Systems. PbLi loop for the HCLL system, helium processing systems for tritium extraction, etc.) have been revised and, where needed, modified according to the assumption that one ITER equatorial port could be available for testing the two European test blanket modules (TBMs). According to EU TBMs programme, two reliable test blanket systems shall be ready for installation on the first day of ITER operation. In order to comply with this ambitious objective, six EURATOM associates who have sustained the TBM program so far have joined themselves in a consortium aiming to ensure an efficient management of the project tasks and exploit specific competences enhancing potential synergies. The consortium objectives and development programme are summarised in the paper. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Boccaccini, L.

While the engineering design of Korean helium cooled solid breeder (HCSB) TBM and its ancillary systems has been performed, a safety assessment on different possible accident scenarios should be carried Out for the purpose of licensing. In this paper, accident analyses for several loss of coolant accident (LOCA) cases were performed in order to assess safety aspects of the TBM design using RELAP5/MOD3.2. Since the TBM forms a loop with helium cooling system (HCS) which is one of ancillary systems required for removing heat deposited in the TBM by neutron wall loading and Surface heat flux from plasma, it is necessary to model the complete loop for accident analysis. In this Study, the helium passage including the TBM and HCS was nodalized for each accident scenario. The TBM and HCS components were modeled as the associated heat structures provided by RELAP5 to include heat transfer across solid boundaries. Based Oil Computational results it was found that current design of the TBM is robust from the safety point of view. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Experimental study of efficiency of natural oxide layers for reduction of tritium permeation through Eurofer 97	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	25th Symposium on Fusion Technology	SEP 15-19, 2008	Rostock, GERMANY	Max Planck Inst Plasmaptys		Tritium; Permeation barriers; TBM; Eurofer 97	BARRIER	Tritium permeation from the breeder through the helium coolant is a fundamental safety issue in the design of the HCLL (Helium coolant lithium lead) blanket system. The permeation of hydrogen isotopes through Eurofer in different conditions was deeply studied in the past, demonstrating that it is necessary to reduce this amount using tritium permeation barriers (TPB). A strong effort has been made to select the best technological solution for the realisation of tritium permeation barriers on complex structures not directly accessible after the completion of the manufacturing process, but after many years of activity for the qualification of different materials acting as TPBs it was demonstrated that these technologies are not yet mature for nuclear applications. An easier solution was identified in the nucleation and growth of natural oxides on the helium-exposed surface of cooling system components. The major objective of this work is the evaluation of the Permeation Reduction Factor (PRF) of natural oxides on Eurofer steel adding a known content of water and hydrogen to argon, used in substitution of helium. The PRF was measured on disk shaped specimens, in gas phase, using the PERI II apparatus, at a temperature of 550 degrees C. The oxide layer was produced in situ, in a well-defined range of hydrogen on water ratios. The obtained results are presented and discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The TRENTA facility has been conceived to allow operation in a closed loop with respect to tritium inventory and to allow investigations of key design and operation issues of combined CECE (Combined Electrolytic Catalytic Exchange) and CD (Cryogenic Distillation) processes in similar conditions as envisaged for the ITER WDS-ISS. Activities combining CECE and CD processes are on going at TLK. For the CD system, dedicated heat-exchangers have been designed and manufactured to make the combination possible. The system of heat-exchangers has to provide a double barrier to avoid tritium contamination of the helium stream. The design of the heat-exchangers for feeding of the CD column, equilibrator loop and condenser will be presented. In addition, the ongoing experimental activities for to the investigation of different CD fillings will be presented. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Design optimisation and measuring techniques for the neutronics experiment on a HCLL-TBM mock-up	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	25th Symposium on Fusion Technology	SEP 15-19, 2008	Rostock, GERMANY	Max Planck Inst Plasmaptys		Tritium breeder blanket; Tritium production; Nuclear cross sections	LITHIUM	A neutronics experiment on a mock-up of the EU Test Blanket Module (TBM), helium cooled lithium lead concept, is in preparation with the objective to validate the capability of the neutronics codes and nuclear data to predict nuclear responses, such as the tritium production rate (TPR), with qualified uncertainties. Three independent measurements of the TPR will be performed using Li(2)CO(3) pellets. Other measurement techniques have been developed using thermo-luminescence detectors, and diamond detectors covered with (6)LiF. Neutron fluxspectra will also be measured from fast energies down to thermal energies, relevant for TPR. Comparison of measured quantities (E) with the same calculated quantities (C) will be provided, together with the related uncertainties. The paper presents the results of development of the measurement techniques and their relevance for tritium measurements in TBM in ITER. It presents also the pre-analyses conducted to optimise the mock-up configuration so that the neutron spectra are as similar as possible to those in the TBM in ITER. Sensitivity/uncertainty assessments of the TPR show that the calculation uncertainty due to the uncertainties of the neutron cross sections amounts to a few %, depending on position. The largest uncertainties are due to the elastic scattering (n,2n), and (n,3n) reactions on Pb. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The NBI is based on the acceleration of hydrogen or deuterium negative ions up to 1 MeV. This work has been aimed at assessing the tritium release from the NBTF in order to provide data for the safety analysis. In particular, the diffusion of the tritium through the neutral beam target material (the CuCrZr alloy calorimeter panels) has been assessed by using literature data of the diffusion coefficient. The tritium generated inside the calorimeter panels moves into both the vacuum and water side: the tritium diffusion flux has been evaluated during the beam-on (200 degrees C) and the beam-off (20 degrees C) phases of the NBTF experiments consisting of an interim campaign and a final test. The penetration depth of the tritium through the 2 min thick CuCrZr alloy material has been also evaluated by using a Monte-Carlo code. As main result, the assessed diffusion flux of tritium during both the beam-on and the beam-off phases are modest. In fact, at the end of the interim campaign (100 days). about the 96% of the all generated tritium (626.5 MBq) exits the calorimeter while the residual tritium inventory (25 MBq) leaves the copper alloy with a diffusion time of about 1 month. At the end of the final test (14 days) about the 99% of the total generated tritium (1.023 x 10(4) MBq) leaves the copper alloy and the remaining tritium inventory (152.2 MBq) is released by about 32 days. In both the interim campaign and the final test, more than the 99% of the total tritium is transferred into the vacuum side of the calorimeter panel while negligible tritium amounts enter the cooling water system thus showing a very low impact on the environment.

Measurements of time-dependent liquid-metal magneto hydrodynamic flows in a flat rectangular duct	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	25th Symposium on Fusion Technology	SEP 15-19, 2008	Rostock, GERMANY	Max Planck Inst Plasmaptys		Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD); Duct flows; Instabilities; Flow regimes	MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC FLOWS	In the helium-cooled lead lithium (HCLL) blanket, which has been chosen as a reference concept for a liquid-metal breeding blanket to be tested in ITER, the heat is removed by helium cooled plates aligned with the strong toroidal magnetic field that confines the fusion plasma. The liquid breeder lead lithium circulates through gaps of rectangular cross-section between the cooling plates to transport the generated tritium towards external extraction facilities. Under the action of the strong magnetic field, liquid metal flows in conducting rectangular ducts exhibit jet-like velocity profiles in the thin boundary layers near the side walls, which are parallel to the magnetic field like the cooling plates in HCLL blankets. The velocity in these side layers may exceed several times the mean velocity in the duct and it is known that these layers become unstable for sufficiently high Reynolds numbers. The present paper summarizes experimental results for such unstable time-dependent flows in strong magnetic fields, which have been obtained in the MEKKA liquid metal laboratory of the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe. In particular, spatial and temporal scales of perturbation patterns are identified. The results Suggest that the flow between cooling plates in a HCLL blanket is laminar and stable. The observed time-dependent flow behavior appears at larger velocities so that the present results are more relevant for applications in dual coolant concepts where high-velocity jets have been predicted along side walls.

Tritium permeation experiment at IFMIF Medium Flux Test Module	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	25th Symposium on Fusion Technology	SEP 15-19, 2008	Rostock, GERMANY	Max Planck Inst Plasmaptys		IFMIF; DEMO; Liquid breeders; Tritium permeation	HYDROGEN; BLANKET	Tritium release experiments using different breeding material candidates are planned for the medium flux region of the I FM IF Test Cell. Nowadays, only ceramic breeder materials have been suggested to be tested in the Tritium Release Module located in the Medium Flux Test Module of IFMIF Liquid breeder blankets are very promising and for that reason, several concepts will be tested in ITER. One of the main problems concerning the liquid blankets is the permeation of the generated tritium in the breeder throughout the walls. Since tritium permeation is highly influenced by irradiation conditions, IFMIF is a suitable scenario to perform tritium permeation related experiments. In this paper, a preliminary design of a tritium permeation experiment for the Medium Flux Test Module of IFMIF is proposed, in order to contribute to the progress of the liquid breeder blanket concept validation. The conceptual design of the capsule in which the experiment will be performed is carried out, taking into consideration the experiment necessities and its implementation in the Tritium Release Module. In addition to this, some thermal hydraulic calculations have been performed to evaluate the thermal behaviour of the irradiation capsule. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, deuterium permeation experiments have been performed on four kinds of steels and erbium oxide coatings fabricated by a filtered arc deposition method. The permeation flux of uncoated samples shows diffusion-limited regime in the temperature range 573-723 K and the permeability is corresponding to literature data. The coated samples deposited at room temperature have been tested at 773 K. It is found that the coatings suppress the deuterium permeation to a close level in spite of different types of steel substrates. In addition, the exponent of the driving pressure slightly changes compared to the uncoated sample. However, the permeation regime is still near diffusion limited. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Tritium generated in the heavy water of the plant has been removed by Wolsong TRF (tritium removal facility)since 2007. Korea has developed a 500-kCi BU-type tritium transport container. Furthermore, strictly controlled tritium release to the environment from the CANDU nuclear power plant in Korea will also be a helpful experience for ITER. The BU-type tritium transport container will be unpacked and the quantity of tritium in the metal tritides of the primary vessel will be measured accurately before the tritium is liberated by heating the metal tritides. In the ITER fuel cycle plant, Korea is responsible for the development and supply of the SDS (fuel storage and delivery system). We present the on-going R&D progress to use a non-nuclear material ZrCo for the storage and delivery of tritium. Especially we present the delivery characteristics of the ZrCo hydride bed by considering the fueling requirement and maintainability of the ZrCo hydride bed. We also present various test results for the experimental ZrCo beds and the test programs for the leak tight large scroll pump with a magnetic coupling-drive. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Design update, thermal and fluid dynamic analyses of the EU-HCPB TBM in vertical arrangement	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	25th Symposium on Fusion Technology	SEP 15-19, 2008	Rostock, GERMANY	Max Planck Inst Plasmaptys		Test blanket module; Helium cooled pebble bed; Finite elements	TEST BLANKET MODULE; TEST STRATEGY; ITER; DEMO	In the frame of the activities of the EU Breeder Blanket Programme and of the Test Blanket Working Group of ITER, the Helium Cooled Pebble Bed Test Blanket Module (HCPB TBM) is developed in Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (FZK) to investigate DEMO relevant concepts for blanket modules. The three main functions of a blanket module (removing heat, breeding tritium and shielding sensitive components from radiation) will be tested in ITER using a series of four TBMs, which are irradiated successively during different test campaigns. Each HCPB TBM will be installed, with a vertical orientation, into the vacuum vessel connected to one equatorial port. As the studies performed up to 2006 in FZK concerned a horizontal orientation of the HCPB TBM. a global review of the design is necessary to match with the new ITER specifications. A preliminary version of the new vertical design is proposed extrapolating the neutronic analysis performed for the horizontal HCPB TBM. An overview of the new HCPB TBM vertical designs, as well as the preliminary thermal and fluid dynamic analyses performed for the validation of the design, are presented in this paper. A critical review of the results obtained allows us, in the conclusion, to prepare a plan for the future detailed analyses of the vertical HCPB TBM. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Preparation of spherical particles of Li2TiO3 (with diameters below 100 mu m) by sol-gel process	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	25th Symposium on Fusion Technology	SEP 15-19, 2008	Rostock, GERMANY	Max Planck Inst Plasmaptys		Fusion reactor; Lithium titanate; Sol-gel		Medium sized spherical particles of Li2TiO3 (With diameters below 100 mu m) can be prepared from peroxy lithium titanate solution (stabilized with citric acid) by a modified INCT (institute of Nuclear Chemistry and Technology) variant of the sol-gel process. The process consists of the following main steps: (I) formation of aqueous phase emulsion in 2-ethylhexanol-1; (II) gelation of emulsion drops by extraction of water with partially dehydrated EH: (III) filtration and washing with carbon tetrachloride or acetone; (IV) non-destructive thermal treatment. The medium size particles can be used for increasing pebble bed density by infiltration them into bed larger spheres (1 mm diameter). The tritium release from sol-gel process preparation of Li2TiO3 microspheres was found very close to that observed for other traditional material however, the new process is more efficient than other processes because of the morphology of the sintered specimens.

One of the research topics aims at improving effectiveness and safety of remote handling manipulation of heavy loads, a significant challenge associated with ITER's maintenance scheme. In all areas needing scheduled maintenance work-in-vessel components, neutral beam injector, hot cells-introduction of man-in-the-loop technologies would provide very useful help in case of unexpected events. The focus of this work is the problem of vibrations experienced when handling heavy loads using flexible robotic structures. Vibrations are induced during start and stop movements, high accelerations or in the case of collision. It is therefore necessary to develop strategies to remove undesired effects of Stimulating dynamics or critical trajectories. Analysis of previous works on flexible arms proves that model-based control of light Structures gives good performance providing that dynamic terms take into account the compliance of the joints and the structural deformation.

Design optimisation of air-fed full pressurised suits	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	25th Symposium on Fusion Technology	SEP 15-19, 2008	Rostock, GERMANY	Max Planck Inst Plasmaptys		Pressurised-suit; Scanning; Respirator protection; CFD		The JET machine and associated facilities require significant maintenance and enhancement installation activities in support of the experimental exploitation programme. A proportion of these activities are within radiological and respiratory hazardous environments. As such, breathing air-fed one-piece pressurised suits provide workers with protection from the inhalation of both airborne tritium and beryllium dust. The design of these suits has essentially developed empirically. There is a practical necessity to improve the design to optimise worker performance, protection and thermal comfort. This paper details the complexity of modeling the three-dimensional thermofluid domain between the inner surface of the suit and under garments that includes mass as well as heat transfer, suiting geometry, human metabolism and respiration and effects of limb movements. The methods used include computational fluid dynamics (CFD), theoretical adaptations of mixed-phase turbulent now, profile scanning of a suit and actuating life size mannequin and data processing of the images and experimental validation trials. The achievements of the current programme and collaborations are presented in the paper and future endeavors are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The maintenance strategy for these components has to ensure system availability after failure or scheduled maintenance. This paper shows how virtual reality (VR) simulation [1] can be used as a tool to analyze the maintenance process, to predict the mean time to repair and to ensure the RH compatibility of one ITER sub-system, the Upper Port Launcher (UPL) [2]. Special emphasis is put on the development of RH procedures and the identification of tooling requirements. The possibility to Simulate RH logistics and repair actions in an early stage of the design process allows for the identification of those maintenance actions that require dedicated tests in the Launcher Handling Test Facility at Karlsruhe. The VR analysis. together with dedicated mock-up tests will demonstrate the RH compatibility of the UPL plug, provide input to the design of the Port Plug maintenance area in the ITER Hot Cell, and support the development of RH maintenance tooling.

The experimental temperature range used has been from 573 K to 793 K and the high purity hydrogen loading pressures from 10(3) Pa to 1.5 x 10(5) Pa. The resultant diffusive transport parameters are a permeability of Phi (mol m(-1) Pa-1/2 s(-1)) = 5.87 x 10(-7) exp(-80.6 kJ mol(-1)/RT), a diffusivity of D (m(2) s(-1)) = 5.70 x 10(-5) exp(-76.8 kJ mol(-1)/RT and a Sieverts' constant of K-s (mol m(-3) Pa-1/2) = 6.01 x 10(-3) exp(-3.7 kJ mol(-1)/RT). The resultant trapping parameters are a trap density of N-t = 3.1 X 10(22) m(-3) and a trapping energy of E-t = 75.4 kJ mol(-1). The presence of ultrafine Al2O3 particles in this material has been demonstrated to affect enormously the hydrogen isotope transport behaviour in comparison to the corresponding base material (Cu) and other copper alloys. Hydrogen trapping phenomenon has become more noticeable in the lower temperature range, yielding an exothermic absorption of hydrogen below 688 K and a decrease in the effective hydrogen diffusivity.

The production of negative ions relies mainly on the conversion on a cesiated surface with a low work function. The influence of Cs on the work function and the optimal layer thickness is discussed. A list of Cs properties relevant for the ion source is compiled. The Cs oven used at IPP Garching is introduced and its modification with a valve is described, test results are presented. The standard of knowledge at IPP of the Cs dynamics in the plasma source is discussed. With respect to the Surface bonding of Cs two methods to control the Cs are presented: the temperature-controlled source chamber and the heated plasma grid. The success of coating the inner source walls with molybdenum is mentioned. Further Cs diagnostics applied and explored at IPP are presented. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Optimisation of operating parameters for plasma facing components detritiation	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	25th Symposium on Fusion Technology	SEP 15-19, 2008	Rostock, GERMANY	Max Planck Inst Plasmaptys		Waste treatment; Detritiation; Plasma facing components; Parameters sensitivity		Within the framework of management of waste produced by fusion facility, the presence of high tritium content in large pieces is very specific. This question is very sensitive in the case of maintenance of plasma facing components (PFC). In order to reach several goals (tritium recovery, limitation of tritium content in the waste), several treatment methods have been analysed and thermal detritiation is selected as a reference process. In the case of ITER facility a tritium recovery station based on this technique is foreseen. In order to better understand which parameters have important influence on the efficiency of the treatment (detritiation factor), a recall of the process principle and of the main data concerning tritium behaviour in different materials is done. For example, low tritium diffusion coefficient in Be which is the material of the first layer on some components can limit drastically the process performance. In this paper a recall of the different process parameters is presented. Some important parameters are selected in order to lead a sensitivity study on adequate variation domains. It allows studying several scenarios of treatment and analysing the consequences of them. The main parameters of this study are the level of temperature, the duration of treatment, the renewal rate of the furnace atmosphere, the presence of Be or not. The main response to this sensitivity analysis is the detritiation factor, however some other consequences such as tritiated water flow rate and also tritium concentration in water are evaluated. Then the consequences of change of operating parameters are compared in order to identify what could be the most appropriate operating domain. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Pre-study of a detritiation process for plasma facing components in the ITER hot cells	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	25th Symposium on Fusion Technology	SEP 15-19, 2008	Rostock, GERMANY	Max Planck Inst Plasmaptys		Detritiation; Plasma facing components; ITER; Tritium fuel cycle		In ITER and future fusion reactors, high heat flux (plasma facing) components will be replaced at regular intervals. Before being stored in hot cells or sent to final disposal, these components or parts of them must be detritiated to recover the large quantities of tritium still contained in the matrix (recycling tritium as fuel) and facilitate the waste acceptance in storage. This paper aims at evaluating the capability of a detritiation process to match the ITER requirements. For that purpose potential detritiation methods have been analysed in terms of detritiation performance leading to the choice of a reference process based on thermal treatment. In parallel, some detailed data concerning the waste have been compiled mainly concerning the amount of waste to treat, and its tritium specific activity with its profile in bulky materials. Since no tritium profile is currently available in ITER documents, an estimation of such profile has been performed based on the modelling of tritium diffusion into the plasma facing components. Thus, the reference detritiation process has been evaluated by a simple but representative modelling. Basically, this first approach enables to confirm the interest of such thermal process. Nevertheless, its design in the ITER hot cells requires a more sophisticated approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Design verification of the heating neutral beam port liner for the ITER vacuum vessel	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	25th Symposium on Fusion Technology	SEP 15-19, 2008	Rostock, GERMANY	Max Planck Inst Plasmaptys		International thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER); Equatorial port; Heating neutral beam (HNB)		The ITER vacuum vessel provides a high quality vacuum for the plasma, as well as the first confinement barrier of radioactive materials. It has upper, equatorial and lower port structures used for equipment installation, utility feedthroughs, vacuum pumping. and access inside the vessel for maintenance. The heating neutral beam (HNB) ports are located side by side at two equatorial ports and provide a path of neutral beam (NB) for plasma heating and current drive. An internal duct liner around the NB is built in the HNB ports, and special panels with tubes armored by copper tiles are placed in the top and bottom of the liner to protect duct surface from high-power heat loads. A global HNB liner model including panels, bulk shielding and tube shielding has been developed, and conjugate heat transfer analyses have been performed to find out pressure drop and heat transfer characteristics of the liner. Heat loads such as NB Power, volumetric heating and surface heat flux without beam steering and misalignment are applied in the analyses. Particularly,severe NB power conditions such as local increment due to the the displacement and peak NB power are considered. Local flow distributions and pressure drop values at each header and branch of the tube are obtained by applying three different coolant flow rates. Together with the coolant How field, temperature and heat transfer coefficient distributions are also acquired. Utilizing temperature gradient data of the panels, thermal stress analyses have been conducted for various analysis conditions. As results of the thermo-hydraulic and the thermal stress analyses, the overall design adequacy of the HNB liner has been evaluated. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Ham, J. K.; Kim, Y.

Conductance modelling of ITER vacuum systems	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	25th Symposium on Fusion Technology	SEP 15-19, 2008	Rostock, GERMANY	Max Planck Inst Plasmaptys		ITER; Vacuum	DESIGN	This paper presents the full network model of the ITER torus vacuum system including the toroidal and radial conductances inside the divertor cassettes, the by-pass leaks between and inside the cassettes, the conductances between the divertor cassettes and the vacuum vessel and inside the pumping ducts up to the cryopumps. The model was built in ITERVAC which is a program for smooth simulation of the mass flow through ducts at isothermal conditions in a wide flow regime including the difficult to describe transitional flow regime that is most relevant to the application for ITER. Simulations were performed for the burn and dwell mode of ITER; deuterium was used as model gas within the simulations. The results show for the burn phase(with four torus cryopumps in pumping mode) a strong back streaming of gas into the plasma which can be 30% higher than the actual throughput to the torus cryopumps. For the dwell phase the effect of pumping with four and eight torus pumps was investigated, respectively. It is shown in this paper that the throughput can be increased between 30% (end of dwell) and 60% (start of dwell) by using eight pumps. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The residual gas analyzer was able to distinguish between D(2) and He peaks during He-GDC. Since the He-GDC started, the partial pressure of D(2) gas increases with time and reached its highest pressure (3.8 x 10(-4) Pa), which was about ten times larger than that before He-GDC. The total amount of D(2), which was released during the He-GDC (7 h), was evaluated as 4.4 Pa m(3). The pressure of D(2) after He-GDC was significantly lower than before He-GDC,which indicates that the He-GDC is effective to remove the deutrium from plasma facing components. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Remotely performed maintenance actions tend to be more time-costly than actions performed by direct human access. With a human operator in the control loop and adequate situational feedback, a two-armed master slave manipulator system can mimic direct access with dexterous manipulation, tactile feedback and vision. But even then, turnaround times are still very high. Adapting the design for simplified maintenance operations can yield significant time savings. One of the methods known to produce a simpler, more robust design, which is also better suited for handling with robots, is Design For Assembly (DFA). This paper discusses whether and how the principles of DFA can be applied to simplify maintenance operations for ITER. While DFA is normally used with series-production and ITER is a unique product. it is possible to apply the principles of DFA to ITER maintenance operations. Furthermore, DFA's principles can be applied at different abstraction levels. Combining principles of DFA with Virtual Reality leads to new insights and provides additional value.

Development of a Laser Ablation System Kit (LASK) for Tokamak in vessel tritium and dust inventory control	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	25th Symposium on Fusion Technology	SEP 15-19, 2008	Rostock, GERMANY	Max Planck Inst Plasmaptys		Laser ablation; LIBS; Dust recovery; Integration	DEPOSITION	During Tokamak operation, Plasma Facing Components (PFCs) are subjected to severe interaction with plasma. As a consequence and independently of the PFCs composition, materials eroded and then redeposited in the form of layers on the surfaces, can flake and produce dusts. These fragile structures are able to trap part of the hydrogenated species (tritium for example) in vessel inventory. For safety reasons, it is mandatory to measure and to control vessel dust and tritium inventory. Up to now, laser techniques are a part of the most promising methods able to solve these ITER open issues. Of special interest are laser systems loaded on a miniature tool that can be attached to a Multi Purpose Deployer (MPD) and used for laser treatments (detritiation and other), for PFCs chemical analysis as well as for micro particles recovery of dust produced during laser ablation. Such a system (Laser Ablation System Kit: LASK) is currently under development at IRFM and the following presentation will describe the current achievements of this project and the perspectives. In this paper, we will present an innovative compact system, which, loaded on a Multi Purpose Deployer, could allow operation in a harsh environment (pressure range from atmospheric to Ultra High Vacuum and temperature up to 120 degrees C). According to the process conditions, different treatments can be performed: at low laser fluence, PFCs thermal treatment will be expected, while at high laser fluence material will be ablated allowing Dust (and T) recovery as well as chemical analysis of material. This "in-line" chemical analysis based on Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) enables the ablation process to be controlled and preserves the substrate integrity. The paper will be focussed on the methodology followed during the LASK development and the method used to determine a laser process window able to remove co-deposited film without damaging the bulk material and taking into account external parameter variation (Multi Purpose Deployer vibrations for example). The first design of the system is proposed that complies with the process requirements and the external constraints. Special emphasis will be given on limitations, and alternatives to these limitations will be proposed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Addition of H-2 to inert sweep gas has been proposed for enhancing the release of bred tritium from breeder material. However, the mass of Li2TiO3 has been found to decrease with time in the hydrogen atmosphere. This mass change indicates that the oxygen content of the sample decreased, suggesting the change from Ti4+ to Ti3+. Development of Li2TiO3 with Li4TiO4 additive is expected to be effective in control the mass change at the time of high temperature use. In the present paper, synthetic methods of advance lithium titanate (Li2TiO3 added with Li4TiO4) have been extensively investigated by solid state reaction. The crystal structure of the sample was analyzed by means of inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The molar raticis Li2O/TiO2 of samples after the reaction were in good agreement with the values at the time of mixing LiOH center dot H2O and H2TiO3. The overall results suggest that the solid state reaction of LiOH center dot H2O and H2TiO3 is one of the most appropriate synthesis methods for advanced lithium titanate with Li4TiO4 in prospect of mass production technology for the test blanket module (TBM) of International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER).

In 2005, a need for an 'absolute' isolation valve was identified to facilitate injector maintenance procedures and protect the system from an in-vessel ingress of coolant event(ICE). An outline concept for an all-metal seal valve was developed during 2006, in close cooperation with the Swiss valve manufacturer VAT. During the following year, it became apparent that the length of beamline available for the valve was significantly less than originally envisaged, resulting in a radical revision of the design concept. A casing length of 760 mm has been achieved by means of major changes to the casing structure. plate dimensions, pendulum mechanism and seal actuators. A concept for a seal protection system has been developed to prevent beam line contamination reaching the valve components and to protect the valve plate from surface heating by plasma radiation. The new design concept has been extensively validated by analysis, including a whole-system FE model of the valve. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nuclear performance analyses of the HCLL breeder blanket for a fusion power reactor	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	25th Symposium on Fusion Technology	SEP 15-19, 2008	Rostock, GERMANY	Max Planck Inst Plasmaptys		Nuclear energy deposition; Tritium breeding ratio; Radiation damage	DESIGN; PLANT	This paper summarizes results of a neutronic study on the performance of the helium-cooled lithium-lead (HCLL) blanket for a fusion power reactor. The analysis is based on three-dimensional radiation transport calculations with the Monte Carlo code MCNP-4C. The neutronic model based on the PPCS reactor model AB developed by FZK has been used in the analysis. Nuclear performance parameters such as the tritium breeding ratio and the energy deposition rate in the blanket and shield and their radial distributions have been evaluated. The radiation-induced displacement and the helium gas production in the steel structure has been calculated. It was shown that the blanket configuration considered provides TBR greater than the required design value. The gaps between blanket modules was shown to affect the global TBR only insignificantly. The radiation damage assessment has indicated that the HTS could not be designed as a life-time component of the reactor for the anticipated 40 years of plant operation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

One of the bed concepts considering now consists of the thin and double layers of ZrCo which are confined by the cylinder-shaped SUS filter and the primary vessel wall. The primary vessel wall is wound by the heating coils, and has the helium channels for the in-bed calorimetry. In this study, the three-dimensional thermo-hydraulic analysis is performed for the bed to investigate the in-bed calorimetry performance. Based on the transient simulation results with an assumption of complete removal of the decay heat by He-loop, it is found that the bed under pre-cooling condition satisfies the accountancy of +/- 1 g-T accuracy in 24h and +/- 3 g-T accuracy in 8 h.

The impact of specific surface area on the retention of deuterium in carbon fiber composite materials	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	25th Symposium on Fusion Technology	SEP 15-19, 2008	Rostock, GERMANY	Max Planck Inst Plasmaptys		Retention; Carbon; Diffusion; Tritium inventory	FACILITY; GRAPHITE; PISCES	In this study, the PISCES-A linear plasma instrument has been used to characterize retention in several carbon fiber composites in order to better understand the factors which lead to elevated retention levels in these materials. The PISCES instrument is capable of subjecting materials to intense fluxes (up to 10(22) m(-1) s(-1)) of low energy (150eV) D(+) ions, producing conditions similar to those encountered by plasma facing components in a fusion reactor. In this investigation, three CFCs (fabricated with different manufacturing processes) are compared with the N11 composite used in the Tore Supra reactor. The specific surface areas for these materials were within the range of 0.14-0.55 m(2)/g. The plasma bombardment conditions were adjusted to provide doses on the order of 10(25)-10(26) m(2) at a sample temperature of 200 degrees C. After removal from PISCES-A, the amount of D retained in the sample Surface was determined via thermal desorption spectroscopy. The measured retention showed a strong correlation with the type of material used and the corresponding BET surface area. By using a CFC with a lower internal porosity, one could expect a reduction in retention by a factor of 5 or more. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Kolasinski, R. D.; Causey, R.

To calibrate a GC for tritium, certified gas mixtures with different tritium concentrations are necessary. These mixtures can be produced directly in a laboratory. In this case an independent method is needed to determine the tritium concentration in the mixture with high accuracy. Calorimetry is the method of choice because its accuracy is better than 1% and it is non-destructive method. Using the closed tritium loop of the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK), different mixtures containing tritium in the range 1-100% have been produced and measured with one of the in-house calorimeters. After that the GC of the CAPER facility at TLK has been calibrated several times with an uncertainty of a few percents. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper presents the arguments in support of the case for the maintainability of the design, notably if this maintenance is to be performed by advanced remote methods. This structure is compliant to the evolving maintenance strategy of ITER. Initial results of a Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) and a development risk analysis for the ITER upper port plug #3, housing the Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy (CXRS) diagnostic, are employed for the definition of the maintenance strategy. The CXRS upper port plug is essentially an optical system which transfers visible light from the plasma into a fiber bundle. The most critical component in this path is the first mirror (M1) whose reflectivity degrades during operation due to deposition and/or erosion dominated effects. Amongst other measures to mitigate these effects, the strategy is to allow for a replacement of this mirror. Therefore it is mounted on a retractable central tube. The main purpose of this tube is to make frequent replacements possible without hindering operation. The maintenance method in terms of time, geometry and spare part policy has a large impact on cost of the system and time usage in the hot cell. Replacement of the tube under vacuum and magnetic field seems infeasible due to the operational risk involved. The preferred solution is to have a spare tube available which is replaced in parallel with other maintenance operations on the vessel, as to avoid any interference in the hot cell with the shutdown scheduling. This avoids having to refurbish a full port plug and also allows for a more frequent replacement of M1, as we can replace the mirror anytime the vacuum vessel is vented, estimated to be once a year.

Molecular-sieving effect of zeolite 3A on adsorption of H-2, HD and D-2	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	25th Symposium on Fusion Technology	SEP 15-19, 2008	Rostock, GERMANY	Max Planck Inst Plasmaptys		Hydrogen-isotope separation; Adsorption; Molecular sieve; Sieving; Confinement; Tritium	HYDROGEN ISOTOPE-SEPARATION; PRESSURE SWING ADSORPTION; WATER VAPOR REMOVAL; 77.4 K; TRITIUM; ADSORBENTS; CONDENSER; RECOVERY; SYSTEMS	Synthetic zeolite 3A has the molecular-sieving windows of nominal diameter 0.3 nm in its crystal lattice framework, which obstruct the crystalline adsorption of molecules of diameter larger than 0.3 nm, except water, hydrogen and helium. The window's diameter slightly varies with temperature, however, that is endorsed in experimental results that hydrogen cannot be adsorbed at the liquid-nitrogen temperature. Authors measured the range of temperature where zeolite 3A permits hydrogen adsorption, and revealed the temperature difference of several degrees in appearance of molecular sieving for H-2 and D-2. This difference is important because from a H-2-D-2 mixture one isotope could be isolated by adsorption if operated at a temperature regulated between the molecular-sieving appearance temperatures. We have reported large values of D-2/H-2 separation factor obtained from molecular-sieving experiments. In this study, the effect of sieving for the hybrid-atomic isotope HD is examined using a H-2-HD-D-2 mixture. We here report the experimental HD/H-2 separation factor evaluated between the D-2/H-2 factor and unity. This result is significant because where the effective molecular diameter concerning the sieving mechanism is suggested. From this knowledge, the isotopic effect of sieving for HT and DT can be predicted. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A HCLL-DEMO reactor has been assessed in 2007, a near term fusion power plant based on limited technologies and plasma extrapolation from ITER. In this frame, this paper presents the results of the activities carried out by CEA teams, including both in vessel and ex vessel components. The high interdependency between the several technological components is highlighted. A careful integrated assessment to further account for the integration of all the components of the machine towards a final robust and consistent version of HCLL-DEMO is also recommended as future activity.

The experimental nature of the ITER Tokamak dictates that Hot Cell tasks will be complex in nature and will evolve over the lifetime of the project. This paper presents the results of a study commissioned by the ITER Organisation and undertaken by Oxford Technologies Ltd and Comex Nucleaire to investigate optimisation of the Hot Cell baseline design to ensure it is able to fulfil these challenging requirements. The study reviews the rationale for the current baseline Hot Cell design, derives a set of design variables which have a significant influence on the Hot Cell (e.g. Divertor refurbishment strategy) and assesses the impact of these variables. The method adopted was to perform a quantitative analysis of the impact of each variable individually without consideration of any other factors. Following on from this a multidimensional analysis, performed by expert assessment, was undertaken to assess the relative benefits and limitations of all of these interacting variables. The output of this study are alternative Hot Cell layouts which are optimised for criteria considered critical to the ITER Organisation, i.e. maximising Tokamak availability and minimising Hot Cell cost and size. This paper discusses the overall study process, issues raised and results. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It requires the development of two independent experiments referred to as SPIDER (source for production of ions of deuterium extracted from Rf plasma) and MITICA (megavolt ITer injector & concept advancement). SPIDER will explore the full-size negative ion source for ITER, whereas MITICA will explore the full-size ITER neutral beam injector. Both experiments will be designed for long-pulse operation, up to 3600 s, as ITER itself. MITICA includes three functional components: the heating neutral beam injector plant system (HNB). which is the device under test; the auxiliary plant system (AUX), which includes all equipment to operate the HNB in the test facility (e.g. the local electric grid to feed the HNB power supplies), and MITICA supervisory system that is an electronics/informatics infrastructure to operate the facility. The paper introduces the requirements for the control and data acquisition systems of the experiments and proposes a preliminary design for both systems. SPIDER, which is preparatory to MITICA and will be developed on a shorter time scale, has no constraints coming from ITER CODAC, whereas MITICA includes the ITER neutral beam injector and therefore must be fully compatible with ITER CODAC.

Engineering studies for integration of the test blanket module (TBM) systems inside an ITER equatorial port plug	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	25th Symposium on Fusion Technology	SEP 15-19, 2008	Rostock, GERMANY	Max Planck Inst Plasmaptys		TBM; ITER; Tritium; Shield; Port plug	DESIGN	The European test blanket module (EU-TBM), first prototype of the breeding blanket concepts under development for the future DEMO power plant to produce the tritium, will be developed to be tested in three equatorial ports of ITER dedicated to this. The CEA Cadarache under the contract of Association EURATOM/CEA and in close relation with Association EURATOM/HAS works on the integration of the EU-TBM inside ITER tokamak. The installation of the TBM into the vacuum vessel is made with the help of a port plug, constituted with two components: the Shield module and the Port-Plug frame. The Shield module provides the neutron shielding inside the Port-Plug frame, which maintains in cantilever position the TBM and its shield module and closes the vacuum vessel port. This paper will describe the EU-TBM design and integration activities on the cooled shield module and on its interface with the TBM component. A particular attention, in term of thermal and mechanical studies, is dedicated to the design of the shield and test blanket module attachment, and also to the shield design and its internal cooling system.

These conditions do not require only a selection of advanced structural materials, but also the development of reliable means to assemble the in-vessel components together; allowing thermal expansions, disassembly, and maintenance in attractive scenarios. Over the course of DEMO lifetime, the materials are subjected to embrittlement by neutron irradiation, swelling, considerable thermo-mechanical fatigue and creep. Traditional joining methods may be rarely used in the harsh fusion environment to assemble different components. In addition any proposed layout should cope with the limited space available inside the vacuum vessel (VV). The objective of this study is to review the proposed attachment systems (developed within the latest European DEMO Conceptual Study) for the vertical segmentation concept called "multi module segments" (MMS). In order to find some place to house the attachments the blanket is cut respecting the Tritium Breeding Ratio limit for tritium self sufficiency. The conditions, neutronic and thermal, in which the attachments are supposed to operate. are calculated. The effects of pulsed operations have also been taken into account. The design of the attachments with the available structural materials with and without an active cooling system is analysed and a new concept for plug/unplug attachments is also suggested.

The three RF additional heating systems for FAST	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	25th Symposium on Fusion Technology	SEP 15-19, 2008	Rostock, GERMANY	Max Planck Inst Plasmaptys		Satellite Tokamak; Heating systems; RF launchers; Multijunction; PAM	PAM LAUNCHER; LHCD; ITER; FTU	FAST (Fusion Advanced Studies Torus) is a new tokamak machine proposed by the Italian Fusion Association as a Satellite Tokamak for the ITER programme. FAST will operate with deuterium plasmas to avoid the complexity deriving from the use of tritium. Therefore burning plasma conditions, where energy density of fast ions and of charged fusion products is a significant fraction of the total plasma energy density, will be achieved by accelerating plasma ions above the half-MeV range through an Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ICRH) system (P=30 MW, f=60-90 MHz). For long pulse Advanced Tokamak (AT) scenarios, a Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) system (P=6 MW,f=3.7 GHz) has been envisaged to actively control the current profile, whereas an Electron Cyclotron Resonant Heating (ECRH) system (P=4 MW. f=170 GHz) will provide enough RF power for MHD control.
