J	Kuczera, B				Kuczera, Bernhard			Through Nuclear Power to Einstein and Back	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article							URANIUM; BODY	Nuclear engineers are more than familiar with the principle of neutron-induced nuclear fission for the peaceful use of nuclear energy. When a neutron has penetrated a fissionable nucleus, that nucleus decays mostly into 2 medium-heavy fragments, releasing an average of three other neutrons plus nuclear power in the process. The neutrons released allow the chain reaction of nuclear fissions in a nuclear reactor to be self-sustaining under control by appropriate devices. The balance of nuclear fission indicates a mass defect related to the release of energy, as can be found in Einstein's famous formula of the equivalence of mass and energy: E = mc(2). Einstein derived this relation when developing his Theory of Special Relativity, which he published at the age of 26 in 1905 in a contribution about electrodynamics. Important findings of that theory are summarized and presented clearly.		Kuczera, B (reprint author), Badenwerkstr 7, D-76137 Karlsruhe, Germany.

WET SCRUBBER COLUMN FOR AIR DETRITIATION	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						air detritiation; tritium facility; packed column	TRITIUM; SYSTEM; JET; PERFORMANCE; FACILITY	This paper evaluates detritiation of air contaminated with tritium in the form of water vapor using a scrubber column filled with structured packing. This technique is based on isotopic exchange between tritiated water vapor and liquid water. In combination with a catalytic oxidizer operated at room or slightly elevated temperature, the scrubber column can also decontaminate air contaminated with tritiated molecular hydrogen. Mass transfer rates measured for structured packings made of stainless steel and copper alloy confirmed high efficiency of the detritiation process. Study of the effect of various operation parameters on column efficiency allows optimization of column operation. It was demonstrated that this technique is competitive with the drying technique with respect to the decontamination factor (DF) provided and the amount of tritiated water to be generated. Benefits offered by the wet scrubber technology are based on the nature of the isotopic exchange process. No need for regeneration allows reduction in the number of units and as such decreases the capital cost of the facility for continuous operation. The DF can be controlled by changing the flow rate of feedwater.	[Perevezentsev, A. N.; Bell, A. C.] UKAEA Euratom Fus Assoc, Culham Sci Ctr, Abingdon OX14 3DB, Oxon, England; [Andreev, B.

SIMULATION OF CECE FACILITY FOR WATER DETRITIATION	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						water detritiation; CECE facility; simulation	ISOTOPIC EXCHANGE; COLUMNS	This paper presents a program to simulate performance of a liquid phase catalytic exchange (LPCE) column of a water detritiation facility based on combined electrolysis and catalytic exchange (CECE) technology over a wide range of deuterium contents in a feed stream. The program uses rate constants of the chemical isotopic exchange reactions between gaseous hydrogen and water vapor occurring on a hydrophobic catalyst and the mass transfer rate between water vapor and the film of liquid water on packing material in the LPCE column, which have been measured experimentally using a specially developed method and at a low concentration of deuterium in a three-isotope mixture. The effect of the deuterium presence on the kinetics of isotopic exchange reactions and the performance of the LPCE column are taken into account considering several possible mechanisms that can control the overall rate of reaction. Selection of the most suitable mechanism was carried out by comparing the simulations with the results of an experimental test with a large deuterium content. The simulation program allows calculation of isotope profiles in streams of liquid water, water vapor, and gaseous hydrogen along the LPCE column over a very wide range of isotopic compositions and for CECE facilities of several different layouts.

DEMONSTRATION OF THE NEXT-GENERATION TCAP HYDROGEN ISOTOPE SEPARATION PROCESS	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						hydrogen isotopes; TCAP process; separation		The first generation of a hydrogen isotope separation process called the thermal cycling absorption process (TCAP) has been in service for tritium separation at the Savannah River Site since 1994. To prepare for replacement, a next-generation TCAP process has been developed. This new process simplifies the column design and reduces the equipment requirements of the thermal cycling system. An experimental 12-m column was fabricated and installed in the laboratory to demonstrate its performance. This new design and its initial test results were presented at the Eighth International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology and are published in the proceedings, Fusion Sci. Technol., Vol. 54, No. 2, p. 399 (2008). We have since completed the start-up and demonstrated the separation of protium and deuterium in the experimental unit. The unit has been operated for more than 200 cycles. A feed of 25% deuterium in protium was separated into two streams, each with better than 99.7% purity.	[Heung, L. K.; Sessions, H.

TAYLOR LECTURE: YUCCA MOUNTAIN RADIATION STANDARDS, DOSE/RISK ASSESSMENTS, THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX, EVALUATIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						regulations; risk estimates; safety standards; National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements	RADIOACTIVE-WASTE REPOSITORY; CANCER; I-129; VALLEY; C-14	The Yucca Mountain high-level radioactive waste repository is designed to contain spent nuclear fuel and vitrified fission products. Due to the fact that it will be the first such facility constructed anywhere in the world, it has proved to be one in which multiple organizations, most prominently the U.S. Congress, are exercising a role. In addition to selecting a site for the facility, Congress specified that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) promulgate the associated Standards, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission establish applicable Regulations to implement the Standards, and the U.S. Department of Energy (U.S. DOE) design, construct, and operate the repository. Congress also specified that U.S. EPA request that the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) provide them guidance on the form and nature of the Standards. In so doing, Congress also stipulated that the Standards be expressed in terms of an "equivalent dose rate." As will be noted, this subsequently introduced serious complications.Due to the inputs of so many groups, and the fact that the NAS recommendations conflicted with the Congressional stipulation that the limits be expressed in terms of a dose rate, the outcome is a set of Standards that not only does not comply with the NAS recommendations, but also is neither integrated, nor consistent. The initial goals of this paper are to provide an independent risk/dose analysis for each of the eight radionuclides that are to be regulated, and to evaluate them in terms of the Standards. These efforts reveal that the Standards are neither workable nor capable of being implemented. The concluding portions of the paper provide guidance that, if successfully implemented, would enable U.S. DOE to complete the construction of the repository and operate it in accordance with the recommendations of NAS while, at the same time, provide a better, more accurate, understanding of its potential risks to the public. This facility is too important to the U.S. nuclear energy program to be impeded by inappropriate Standards and unnecessary regulatory restrictions. As will be noted, the sources of essentially all of the recommendations suggested in this paper were derived through applications of the principles of good science, and the benefits of "thinking outside the box."

LOW-DOSE EXTRAPOLATION OF RADIATION HEALTH RISKS: SOME IMPLICATIONS OF UNCERTAINTY FOR RADIATION PROTECTION AT LOW DOSES	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						cancer; epidemiology; linear hypothesis; National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements	ATOMIC-BOMB SURVIVORS; CANCER-RISKS	Ionizing radiation is a known and well-quantified human cancer risk factor, based on a remarkably consistent body of information from epidemiological studies of exposed populations. Typical examples of risk estimation include use of Japanese atomic bomb survivor data to estimate future risk from radiation-related cancer among American patients receiving multiple computed tomography scans, persons affected by radioactive fallout, or persons whose livelihoods involve some radiation exposure, such as x-ray technicians, interventional radiologists, or shipyard workers. Our estimates of radiation-related risk are uncertain, reflecting statistical variation and our imperfect understanding of crucial assumptions that must be made if we are to apply existing epidemiological data to particular situations. Fortunately, that uncertainty is also highly quantifiable, and can be presented concisely and transparently. Radiation protection is ultimately a political process that involves consent by stakeholders, a diverse group that includes people who might be expected to be risk-averse and concerned with plausible upper limits on risk (how bad could it be?), cost-averse and concerned with lower limits on risk (can you prove there is a nontrivial risk at current dose levels?), or combining both points of view. How radiation-related risk is viewed by individuals and population subgroups also depends very much on perception of related benefit, which might be (for example) medical, economic, altruistic, or nonexistent The following presentation follows the lead of National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) Commentary 14, NCRP Report 126, and later documents in treating radiation protection from the viewpoint of quantitative uncertainty analysis.

THE ROLE OF DOSE-RATE ON RISK FROM INTERNALLY-DEPOSITED RADIONUCLIDES AND THE POTENTIAL NEED TO SEPARATE DOSE-RATE EFFECTIVENESS FACTOR (DREF) FROM THE DOSE AND DOSE-RATE EFFECTIVENESS FACTOR (DDREF)	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						dogs; dose; dose, low; National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements	FUSED CLAY PARTICLES; TRANSFORMATION IN-VITRO; IONIZING-RADIATION; ADAPTIVE RESPONSE; INHALED Y-90; LUNG-CANCER; BEAGLE DOGS; GAMMA-IRRADIATION; INDUCTION; TOXICITY	In 1980, National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements suggested the term dose-rate effectiveness factor (DREF) to describe the reduction of effectiveness of protracted radiation in producing biological damage and risk. A nonlinear decrease in damage was also noted following low total doses. The International Commission on Radiological Protection therefore combined the influence of low dose and low dose-rate and assigned a single value of 2.0 for a dose and dose-rate effectiveness factor (DDREF) to be applied for estimating risk for both low total dose and low dose-rate exposures. This paper re-evaluates one extensive data set on inhaled radionuclides in dogs which suggests that there may be a need to separate these factors (DREF and DDREF) for larger protracted doses from internally-deposited radioactive materials. Extensive recent research on the mechanisms of action of both low dose and low dose-rate radiation exposure at the molecular, cellular, and animal level of biological organization suggest that the influence of protraction of radiation may be large and variable, due to adaptive and protective responses, following very low doses and dose-rate exposures. Important observations in this paper in dogs exposed by inhalation to beta-gamma emitting radionuclides include (1) discontinuities in the data sets as a function of both dose and dose-rate suggesting shifts in mechanisms of action following high doses from protracted exposure away from those postulated for cancer from low total doses; (2) no increase in non-neoplastic disease, cancer frequency, or life-shortening following low dose-rate exposures to high total lung doses (up to 25 Gy); (3) all dogs that received doses below 25 Gy were combined and a decrease in the frequency of lung cancer in these exposed animals relative to the controls was noted, while very large doses from all radionuclides studied resulted in very marked increases in lung cancer; (4) a significant increase in hemangiosarcoma in the heart and tracheobronchial lymph nodes was observed after very high doses; (5) in this paper the DREF for lung cancer in dogs relative to single acute radiation exposure was as high as 35; and (6) the amount of life-shortening increased per unit dose as a function of the half-life with Y-90 being eight times as effective per unit of dose as Sr-90. Such information suggests that there may be a need to assign different values for DDREF and DREF, especially in situations where there are large nonuniform total doses delivered by internally-deposited radionuclides. This is extremely important since the risk from radiation exposure from internally-deposited radionuclides in the lungs following nuclear fallout, accidents and terrorist activities may be much less than currently projected.

THE IMPACT OF DOSIMETRY UNCERTAINTIES ON DOSE-RESPONSE ANALYSES	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						analysis, statistical; dosimetry; epidemiology; National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements	EXPOSURE MEASUREMENT ERROR; LUNG-CANCER; RESIDENTIAL RADON; RADIATION WORKERS; NUCLEAR INDUSTRY; RISK; REANALYSIS; PLUTONIUM; COHORT; MODEL	Radiation dose estimates. used in epidemiological studies are subject to many sources of uncertainty, and the error structure may be a complicated mixture of different types of error. Increasingly, efforts are being made to evaluate dosimetry uncertainties and to take account of them in statistical analyses. The impact of these uncertainties on dose-response analyses depends on the magnitude and type of error. Errors that are independent from subject to subject (random errors) reduce statistical power for detecting a dose-response relationship, increase uncertainties in estimated risk coefficients, and may lead to underestimation of risk coefficients. The specific effects of random errors depend on whether the errors are "classical" or "Berkson." Classical error can be thought of as error that arises from an imprecise measuring device, whereas Berkson error occurs when a single dose is used to represent a group of subjects (with varying true doses). Uncertainties in quantities that are common to some or all subjects are "shared" uncertainties. Such uncertainties increase the possibility of bias, and accounting for this possibility increases the length of confidence intervals. In studies that provide a direct evaluation of risk at low doses and dose rates, dosimetry errors are more likely to mask a true effect than to create a spurious one. In addition, classical errors and shared dosimetry uncertainties increase the potential for bias in estimated risks coefficients, but this potential may already be large due to the extreme vulnerability to confounding in studies involving very small relative risk.

J	Poston, JW; Ford, JR				Poston, John W., Jr.; Ford, John R.			HOW DO WE COMBINE SCIENCE AND REGULATIONS FOR DECISION MAKING FOLLOWING A TERRORIST INCIDENT INVOLVING RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS?	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						emergency planning; exposure, population; regulations; National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements		Approaches to safety regulations-particularly radiation safety regulation-must be founded on the very best science possible. However, radiation safety regulations always lag behind the science for a number of reasons. First, the normal scientific process of peer-review, debate, and confirmation must ensure that the conclusions are indeed correct, the implications of the research are fully understood, and a consensus has been established. Second, in the U.S., there is a well-established, all-inclusive political process that leads to changes in radiation safety regulations. This process can take a very long time, as was demonstrated when the process was initiated to change the Code of Federal Regulations more than 20 y ago in response to International Commission on Radiation Protection Publication 26 and other recommendations. Currently, we find ourselves in a situation where the possibility of a terrorist radiological attack may occur and where the existing body of regulations provides very little guidance. Many international and national bodies, including several federal agencies, have provided recommendations on the appropriate levels of exposure for first-responders and first-receivers, as well as for the general public. However, some agencies provide guidelines based on very conservative dose limits which are not appropriate in situations where there is a substantial chance for the loss of lives and critical infrastructure. It is important that an emergency response is not hampered by overly cautious guidelines or regulations. In a number of exercises the impact of disparate guidelines and training in radiological situations has highlighted the need for clear reasonable limits that maximize the benefit from an emergency response and for any cleanup after the incident. This presentation will focus first on the federal infrastructure established to respond to radiological accidents and incidents. It will review briefly the major recommendations, both international and national, for responders and will attempt, where possible, to establish the scientific foundation for these guidelines. We will also stress the need to clearly and openly communicate the recommendations to the first-responders and the public so that no unnecessary anxiety or associated actions on their part impedes the ability to respond to a disaster. Finally, the use of these guidelines and recommendations by decision-makers at all levels will be discussed.

Determination of an Environmental Background Level of Sr-90 in Urine for the Hanford Bioassay Program	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topics; Sr-90; excretion, urinary; bioassay		During the decommissioning and maintenance of some of the facilities at the U.S. Department of Energy Hanford Site in Washington State, workers have potential for a Sr-90 intake. However, because of worldwide radioactive fallout, Sr-90 is present in our environment and can be detectable in routine urine bioassay samples. It is important for tire Hanford Site bioassay program to discriminate an occupational intake from a nonoccupational environmental one. A detailed study of the background Sr-90 in the urine of unexposed Hanford workers was performed. A survey of the Hanford Site bioassay database found 128 Hanford workers who were hired between 1997 and 2002 and who had a very low potential for an occupational exposure prior to the baseline strontium urinalysis. Each urinalysis sample represented excretion during an approximate 24-h period. The arithmetic mean value for the 128 pre-exposure baselines wars 3.6 +/- 5.1 mBq d(-1). The 99(th) percentile result was 17 mBq d(-1), which was interpreted to mean that 1% of Hanford workers not occupationally exposed to strontium might exceed 17 mBq d(-1).

Results of a Self-Absorption Study on the Versapor 3000 47-mm Filters for Radioactive Particulate Air Stack Sampling	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topics; air sampling; correction factors; radioactivity, environmental	ALPHA	Since the mid-1980's the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has used a value of 0.85 as a correction factor for the self absorption of activity for particulate radioactive air samples collected from building exhaust for environmental monitoring. More recently, an effort was made to evaluate the current particulate radioactive air sample filters (Versapor (R) 3000, 47-mm diameter) used at PNNL for self absorption effects. There were two methods used to characterize tire samples. Sixty samples were selected frost the archive for acid digestion to compare the radioactivity measured by direct gas-flow proportional counting of filters to the results obtained after acid digestion of the filter and counting again by gas-flow proportional detection. Thirty different sample filters were selected for visible light microscopy to evaluate filter loading and particulate characteristics. Mass-loading effects were also considered. Large error is associated with the sample filter analysis comparison and subsequently with the estimation of the absorption factor resulting in an inadequate method to estimate losses from self-absorption in the sample filter. The mass loading on the sample filter as determined after digestion and drying was similar to 0.08 mg cm(-2); however, this value may not represent the total flier mass loading given that there may be undetermined losses associated with tire digestion process. While it is difficult to determine how much material is imbedded in the filter, observations front the microscopy analysis indicate that the vast majority of the particles remain on the top of the filter. In comparing the results obtained, the continued use of 0.85 as a conservative correction factor is recommended. Health Phys. 97(Supplement3): S161-S168; 2009	[Barnett, J. M.; Barnett, D.

Surge Capacity Volunteer Perspectives on a Field Training Exercise Specifically Designed to Emphasize Likely Roles During a Disaster Response	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topics; emergency planning; accidents, handling; radiological terrorism		Experience gained from involvement in a number of emergency response activities since September 2001 in Texas indicated that the likely roles of statewide medical reserve corps units typically included aspects such as crowd control, registration and tracking, and information management. The need for training specifically focused on these likely roles became apparent. A novel field training exercise was developed that specifically focused on these likely roles. The exercise centered on a scenario involving the surreptitious placement of radioactivity in high traffic areas across the country, resulting in the contamination of large numbers of individuals. Because the source of the contamination was unknown, surge capacity contamination screening and data collection centers became necessary. Feedback collected from drill participants was measured to be overwhelmingly positive, with the vast majority of participants indicating a marked improvement in their understanding of their likely roles in a disaster of this type. The approach used in this training effort may be of use to other disaster surge capacity organizations as part of their strategic planning efforts as a means of ensuring that individuals involved in response activities possess familiarity with their likely roles during a wide scale public health disaster event.

In this study, the electrochemical codeposition of uranium and zirconium on a solid cathode was performed. It was found that the delta-(U, Zr) phase, which is the only intermediate phase of the uranium-zirconium binary alloy system, was deposited on a tantalum substrate by potentiostatic electrolysis at -1.60 V (vs. Ag(+)/Ag) in LiCl-KCl melts containing 0.13 in mol% UCl(3) and 0.23 in mol% ZrCl(4) at 773 K. To our knowledge. this is the first report on the electrochemical formation of the delta-(U, Zr) phase. The relative partial molar properties of uranium in the delta-(U, Zr) phase were evaluated by measuring the open-circuit-potentials of the electrochemically prepared delta-phase electrode.

Phase constituents of Al-rich U-Mo-Al alloys examined by transmission electron microscopy	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							DISPERSION FUEL; DIFFUSION COUPLES; INTERACTION LAYER; IRRADIATION BEHAVIOR; LOW-TEMPERATURE; URANIUM; ALUMINUM; GROWTH; SYSTEM; INTERDIFFUSION	To supplement the understanding of diffusional interactions involving Al-rich region of the U-Mo-Al system, alloys with composition 85.7Al-11.44U-2.86Mo and 87.5Al-10U-2.5Mo in at.%, were examined to determine the equilibrium phase constituents at 500 degrees C. These alloys were triple arc-melted, homogenized at 500 degrees C for 200 h, and water-quenched to preserve the high temperature microstructure. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (XEDS). and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with high angle annular dark field (HAADF) imaging via scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) were employed for the characterization. Alloy specimens for TEM/STEM were prepared using site-specific focused ion beam (FIB) in situ lift-out (INLO) technique. Despite the homogenization time and temperature, five different phases, namely fcc-Al solid solution, cubic-UAl(3), orthorhombic-UAl(4), hexagonal-U(6)Mo(4)Al(43) and diamond cubiC-UMo(2)Al(20), were observed. Based on U-Al, U-Mo and Al-Mo binary phase diagrams, previously proposed U-Mo-Al isotherms, and the solidification microstructure of these alloys, the Al-rich region of the equilibrium ternary isotherm at 500 degrees C was constructed. The fcc-Al solid solution, orthorhombic-UAl(4), and diamond cubic-UMo(2)Al(20) which were determined to be the equilibrium phases in 85.7Al-11.44U-2.86Mo and 87.5Al-10U-2.5Mo alloys.

Thermogravim etric and differential thermal analysis reaction profiles are described that reflect changes in the uranium fluorination/oxidation state, physiochemical effects, and instances of discrete chemical speciation. Large differences in the onset temperatures for each system investigated implicate changes in mode of the NF3 gas-solid surface interaction. These studies also demonstrate that NF3 is a potential replacement fluorinating agent in the existing nuclear fuel cycle and in actinide volatility reprocessing. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Models of thermal, mechanical and chemical properties of the materials are used in a series of finite-element simulations to study the effect of the coupled phenomena on the temperature profile, oxygen distribution and radial deformation of the fuel element. The simulations include steady-state and time-dependent regimes in a variety of initial- and boundary value conditions that include sudden changes in the power density, variable oxygen content in the atmosphere, and variable temperature of the coolant. The study reveals the difference in the characteristic times associated with these phenomena and the importance of performing coupled simulations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two important things were observed. The first was that three kinds of precipitated phase had been detected in the saturated liquid Cd cathode, such as a U metal and two rids of U-Pu-Cd compound. The compositions of the compounds were roughly (U+Pu):Cd = 1: 11 and (U+Pu):Cd = 1:6. The second was that the U metal had selectively precipitated in the saturated liquid Cd cathode under the condition that the U:Pu ratio is higher than about 0.8 in the liquid Cd phase. In the present study, phase diagrams were evaluated by the CALPHAD method on the liquid Cd cathode containing U and Pu. The U-Pu-Cd compounds were modeled as MCd11-type and MCd6-type, respectively, based on the reported binary phase diagrams of U-Cd and Pu-Cd. The calculated result reasonably agreed with the experimental observations. The variations in the U and Pu activities were estimated along with the U:Pu ratio, which is related to the precipitation of various phases in the liquid Cd cathode.

In the weakly acidic and neutral pH regions, the apparent solubility in the presence of carboxylic acids was higher than that in the absence of the acids, due to the formation of soluble carboxylate complexes. Under acidic conditions, the precipitation of oxalate salt influenced the apparent solubility in the presence of oxalic acid, while no precipitate was observed in the presence of rnalonic acid. The Solubility product was obtained for the solubility-limiting phase from the analysis of the solubility data.

Experiments have been carried out to develop a simple but robust radionuclide sequential extraction method for identification of radionuclide partitioning in sediments and soils. The sequential extraction protocol was optimized for temperature, concentration of reagents and reaction time. Optimum extraction conditions were chosen based on the release of (239,240)Pu, (238)U and stable elements. Results from the experiments with lake sediment (SRM 4354) are compared to the previous trials where the sequential extraction protocol was optimized with the ocean sediment (SRM 4357). Based on these two trials the NIST standard sequential extraction protocol is established for defined extraction settings for temperature, reagent concentration and time.

These materials were analyzed using a KF fusion procedure and an acid dissolution procedure. The latter method yielded radioactive concentrations that were 15-20% lower then that of the former. This was thought to be due to a fraction of the sample, "resistates," that did not dissolve during the dissolution. In this study, HF dissolutions were conducted on NIST natural matrix SRMs, in which similar to 0.08% of total sample mass remained after dissolution. The acid resistant residual materials were concentrated, then dissolved using a LiBO(2) fusion procedure and were found to contain a considerable fraction of the uranium and thorium.

The soil samples were spiked with (233)U and (242)Pu tracers, dissolved in minerals acids, and U and Pu isotopes isolated and purified on commercially available ion-exchange columns. The ion-exchange technique employed a TEVA(A (R)) column coupled to a UTEVA(A (R)) column. U and Pu isotope fractions were then further isolated using separate elution schemes, and the purified fractions containing U and Pu isotopes analyzed sequentially using multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MCICP-MS). High precision measurements of (234)U/(235)U, (238)U/(235)U, (236)U/(235)U, and (240)Pu/(239)Pu in soil samples were attained using the described methodology and instrumentation, and provide a basis for conducting more detailed assessments of the behavior and transfer of uranium and plutonium in the environment.

To obtain reliable results, however, a sufficiently long counting time at every probing energy and a large number of experimental points per XANES spectrum are required, due to the complex mathematical model used to fit the measured spectrum. This makes micro-mapping difficult, since the time required for data collection becomes unacceptably long. A simplified model for data collection and evaluation is presented. Its effectiveness has been tested by measuring the distribution of Pu oxidation states in a "hot" particle coming from a nuclear weapon test site.

Experimental measurements of short-lived fission products from uranium, neptunium, plutonium and americium	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Fission products; Short-lived radionuclides; Research reactor experiments; Actinide fission	GAMMA-RAYS; ENERGY	Fission yields are especially well characterized for long-lived fission products. Modeling techniques incorporate numerous assumptions and can be used to deduce information about the distribution of short-lived fission products. This work is an attempt to gather experimental (model-independent) data on short-lived fission products. Fissile isotopes of uranium, neptunium, plutonium and americium were irradiated under pulse conditions at the Washington State University 1 MW TRIGA reactor to achieve similar to 10(8) fissions. The samples were placed on an HPGe (high purity germanium) detector to initiate counting in less than 3 min post irradiation. The data was analyzed to determine which radionuclides could be quantified and compared to the published fission yield data.

A measure of the neutron capture cross sections on Lu-173 is needed to improve the interpretation value of the Lu radiochemistry isotopic ratios. A natural hafnium target was irradiated with protons to produce neutron poor lutetium radioisotopes. The short lived species were allowed to decay prior to chemical processing resulting in predominantly Lu-173 with a small amount of Lu-174.

Seelmann-Eggebert; Nuclide data; Nuclide chart history		Radioactivity has been known for more than a hundred years. Nuclear data compilations through nuclide charts began in the 1920s with the work of Soddy, and were later rationalized in the Karlsruher Nuklidkarte. For 50 years, it has depicted the status of our nuclear knowledge in an easy reading form. It was born as an educational and scientific tool that gives access to the basic bricks that the nuclear Physics community needs to build the physics knowledge at the femtometer (10(-15) m) level. Nuclide data is a bridge between research and development. On the one hand, the nucleus can be regarded as a vast laboratory with, the possibility to test from fundamental concepts of the Standard Model to the genesis of the elements in the Universe. On the other hand, this data is also leading to applications in many areas of everyday life such as health care or environmental monitoring.

A naturally occurring radioactive isotope of potassium, (40)K, is found in the food and water that we consume. This paper presents the results of a gamma spectrometry analysis of the (40)K concentrations of a selection of commercial soft drinks. The (40)K concentrations are used to calculate the overall potassium concentrations. The analysis was carried out using a hyper-pure germanium (HPGe) detector with Ortec(A (R)) ASPEC-927 multichannel analyzer module and GammaVision(A (R)) software. This system was chosen for its high resolution and automatic data processing. The carbonated soft drinks (sodas) Coca-Cola(A (R)), Coca-Cola Light(A (R)) (sold as Diet Coke(A (R)) in the USA and other countries), Coca-Cola Zero(A (R)), Pepsi(A (R)), Pepsi Light(A (R)), Pepsi Max(A (R)), Big Cola(A (R)), Lulu-Cola(A (R)), Manzana Lift(A (R)), Sprite(A (R)) and Fanta(A (R)) and the mineral waters Ciel(A (R)) and Peafiel(A (R)) were analyzed. These brands are all international registered trademarks. The products analyzed were manufactured and bottled in Mexico. The results show a great variety of potassium concentrations in the different soft drinks analyzed (from 128.0 to 1113.1 mg/L). The concentration of potassium in the sodas, in conjunction with the amounts drank by one person in a year (180 L/year), are high enough to warrant consideration by public health authorities and by people to whom high potassium intakes pose a risk.

Industrial commercial respirator filter as indoor radon monitor	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Indoor radon; Gamma spectrometry; (214)Bi; Respiratory filter		This paper presents a method for measuring indoor radon concentrations using a commercially available air-purifying respirator filter as a component of the radon monitor. The filter used was Survivair's NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety)-approved 100800 model. The method is based on the diffusion of radon gas into the activated carbon of the filter and the measurement of the radioactive daughters resulting from the radon decay. The photopeaks of the (214)Bi daughter gamma rays (0.609 MeV) were analyzed with a Hyper-Pure Germanium (HPGe) detector and a multichannel system. A monotonically increasing and very close to linear response relation between the integrated area under the (214)Bi photopeak and the radon concentration of the activated carbon was found. A well-defined relation held for radon levels ranging from 15 to 4,700 Bq/m(3). This procedure results in highly reproducible and reliable measurements of indoor radon levels. Interesting applications include the investigation of radiological accidents involving radon and the retrospective measuring of indoor radon concentrations by analyzing the filters of the respirators worn by personnel working during the relevant period.

A radiation index and measurements with a radiation meter established that the annual effective dose rates due to a 1 h/day exposure to gamma rays emitted by the granite samples were often low, but can occur as high as 1 mSv/year.

Screening of foods and related products for toxic elements with a portable X-ray tube analyzer	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Portable XRF; Toxic elements; Foods; Thin films; Glazes	CERAMIC GLAZES; SPECTROMETRY; HOUSEWARES; LEAD	Capabilities of a portable X-ray tube-based analyzer were evaluated for screening foods, thin films, and ceramic glazes for toxic elements. A beverage spiked with Cr, Cu, and As and cocoa powder spiked with As and Pb could easily be distinguished from unadulterated products when analyzed through their original container walls. With calibration, results for thin films and ceramic glazes yielded accurate Pb results. Limits of detection (LODs) were 0.2-15 and 15 mu g cm(-2), respectively, for Pb and Cd in thin films and about 2 mu g cm(-2) for Pb in glazes. With analysis times of 0.5-1 min, sensitivities and LODs were superior to those obtained with radioisotopic X-ray fluorescence analysis.

It was significantly contaminated by radioactivity following the Chernobyl accident in 1986, the major contaminant being long-lived Cs-137. Due to the slow exchange of water between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea and the relatively rapid sedimentation rates, radionuclides have prolonged residence times in the Baltic Sea. Cs-137 levels are consequently still clearly higher than in other water bodies around the world. In addition to the Chernobyl accident, artificial radionuclides in the Baltic Sea originate from the global fallout following nuclear weapons testing in the 1950s and 1960s, while discharges into the Baltic Sea from nuclear power plants and other facilities are of minor importance. Here, inventories and the temporal evolution of radionuclides both in seawater and sediments of the Baltic Sea are presented and discussed.

Mushroom samples were collected in a forest environment between 1986 and 2007 and the transfer of Cs-137 to two edible species, Suillus variegatus and Cantharellus spp., was investigated. The Cs-137 uptake by the collected samples did not decrease over time and in Cantharellus spp. a significant increase was observed. Most of the Cs-137 in soil still appears to be available for uptake and radioactive decay of the radionuclide is likely the main factor for the reduction of Cs-137 in a forest ecosystem.

Evaluation of heavy metal uptake in micropterus salmoides (Largemouth Bass) of Lake Austin, TX by neutron activation analysis	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Neutron activation analysis; Environmental monitoring; Heavy metals		Neutron activation analysis was used to investigate and quantify the level of heavy metal uptake in the marine environment of Lake Austin in Austin, TX. Specifically, the samples studied were largemouth bass, or micropterus salmoides. The presence of heavy metals in the food chain presents multiple hazards, mostly as a food hazard for those species that ingest the fish, namely humans. To measure the concentrations of heavy metals in various fish samples, the nuclear analytical technique of neutron activation analysis (NAA) was used. Both epithermal and thermal irradiations were conducted for the NAA to look for short and long-lived radioisotopes, respectively. The samples themselves consisted of liver and tissue samples for each of the fish caught. Each sample was freeze-dried and homogenized before irradiation and spectrum acquisition. The results showed that all levels of heavy metals were not sufficient enough to make the fish unsafe for eating, with the highest levels being found for iron and zinc. Gold was found to be at much higher concentrations in the younger fish and virtually non-existent in the larger of the samples.	[Weaver, J.; Wilson, W. H.; Biegalski, S. R. F.; O'Kelly, D.

A forced convection of molten eutectic (LiCl-KCl) electrolyte in an electrorefining cell is considered to establish an appropriate electro-fluid model within the 3-dimensional framework of a conventional computational fluid dynamic model. This computational platform includes the electrochemical reaction rate of charge transfer kinetics which is described by a Butler-Volmer equation, while mass transport is considered using an ionic transport equation. The coupling of the local overpotential distribution and uranium concentration gradient makes it possible to predict the local current density distribution at the electrode surfaces.	[Kim, K.

The average Pu-240/Pu-239 atom ratio observed in dried F. distichus collected from Amchitka Island was 0.227 +/- A 0.007 (N = 5) and compares with the expected Pu-240/Pu-239 atom ratio in integrated worldwide fallout deposition in the Northern Hemisphere of 0.1805 +/- A 0.0057. In the absence of any evidence of a local source of plutonium containing an elevated Pu-240/Pu-239 isotopic signature, the characteristically high Pu-240/Pu-239 content of F. distichus supports the view of the existence of a discernible, basin-wide non-fallout source of plutonium entering the subarctic Pacific.

Stan; Westmoreland, James B.; Rhineheart, April			Self contained enrichment cell for tritium	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Tritium; Enrichment; Concentration; Analysis		Tritiated water is probably the most mobile manmade nuclide found in the environment. The low-energy beta decay produces few health concerns except at extremely high concentrations of tritium. However, because of the ubiquitous nature of tritiated water, when identified in the bionetwork, it can be viewed as a precursor of nuclides with greater health risks. For this reason alone it becomes desirable to determine tritium concentrations many orders of magnitude below that considered a health concern. A devise is described that eliminates the need for large water-filled chest freezers used as coolers. The enrichment cells can be employed individually or in series.	[Morton, J.

Weighted exponential regression for characterizing radionuclide concentrations in soil depth profiles	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Radionuclide concentrations; Soil; Gamma-ray spectrometer; (137)Cesium data; Alpha/rho estimation; Exponential regression analysis		Characterization of radionuclide concentrations in soil profiles requires accurate evaluation of the depth distribution of the concentrations as measured by gamma emissions. Recent studies of (137)Cs activity at the Idaho National Laboratory indicate that these data consistently follow exponential trends when the fraction of radioactivity below depth is plotted against depth. The slope of the exponential regression fit is defined as alpha/rho (alpha/rho), the depth profile parameter. A weighted exponential regression procedure has been developed to compute a mean alpha/rho for a group of related soil samples. Regression results from different areas or from different time periods can be used to compare representative radionuclide concentrations for the specified groupings.

Spatial distribution investigation of radioactivity of potable waters in Luxembourg	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Radioactive isotopes; Radiochemical separation; Spectroscopy of radioactivity; ICP-MS; Waters in Luxembourg	THORIUM; URANIUM; RADIUM; GROUNDWATER; LEAD	A survey of naturally occurring radio-nuclides was performed on the territory of Luxembourg in order to identify the main physical and chemical parameters in drinking waters. During last summer water samples from 316 different outflows were collected twice and analyzed. A routine laboratory sequentional extraction radiochemistry procedure was applied for monitoring low concentrations of radio-nuclides in natural waters. New investigations were done to optimize some analysis conditions for the different determination procedures. A quality assurance procedure was applied. The obtained results are analyzed in term of spatial distribution, supported geology and chemistry.

The applied procedures were adapted for very small amount (0.25 g) of sample material and were checked in actual biota samples. Measurements were made by liquid scintillation counting, alpha- and gamma-spectrometry. All the results show that Ca(3)(PO(4))(2) precipitation technique is better for determination of trace radionuclide concentrations in biota. The procedure of separation is stable with significant yield for the both (210)Pb and radium's isotopes and can be successfully used for assessment of environmental stressors in field of bio-monitoring.

Determination of tritium enrichment parameters of a commercially available PEM electrolyzer: a comparison with conventional enrichment electrolysis	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Isotopic enrichment; Proton exchange membrane; Electrochemical reduction; Nafion		Aqueous tritium enrichment parameters of a commercially available Iridium/Platinum (Ir/Pt) polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) cell were determined after electrolysis of tritium aqueous standards, and compared to those of a conventional Nickel/Iron (Ni/Fe) electrochemical cell. Lower aqueous enrichment is seen in the Ir/Pt PEM electrolyzer in comparison to the conventional Ni/Fe electrolytic cell. This is explained by the values found for the PEM cell fractionation factor beta (Ir/Pt) and electrolytic fractionation factor beta (eIr/Pt) values determined to be 4.7 +/- A 0.3 (beta (Ni/Fe) = 26), and 6.6 +/- A 0.7 (beta (eNi/Fe) = 37), respectively. A direct consequence of the Ir/Pt beta (e) value is the richer tritium gas phase produced relative to the conventional cell, which is advantageous for direct reduction of HTO to HT gas.

Unique challenges with recent gamma spectroscopy measurements at Los Alamos National Laboratory	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Gamma ray spectroscopy; Non-destructive assay; Isotopic analyses; Monte Carlo neutral particle; MCNP; FRAM; SNAP; Plutonium; Uranium; Natural uranium; Neutron sources; Plutonium-Beryllium; PuBe		A variety of unique radioactive samples have been measured recently at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) using an electrically-cooled high-purity germanium detector. In each case the purpose of the measurements included one or more of the following objectives: (1) an accurate determination of the isotopic weight fractions of different plutonium or uranium materials; (2) an accurate determination of the isotopic quantity in the absence of relevant calibration standards; and (3) a qualitative determination of various sample impurities for additional forensic information. This paper discusses how simple modifications to the PC-FRAM parameter sets enabled a better determination of the isotopic content of the following samples: (1) high-purity plutonium metal, (2) plutonium-beryllium (PuBe) neutron sources, (3) neutron-irradiated natural uranium, and (4) re-processed HEU fuel with elevated (236)U content. The isotopic quantity in a variety of samples was determined using a combination of the Spectral Nondestructive Assay Platform (SNAP (TM)) routine from Eberline Services and the Monte Carlo Neutral Particle (MCNP) code developed at LANL.

Analysis of nuclear materials by energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence and spectral effects of alpha decay	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						X-ray fluorescence (XRF); EDXRF; Alpha decay		Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) spectra collected from alpha emitters are complicated by artifacts inherent to the alpha decay process, particularly when using portable instruments. For example, (239)Pu EDXRF spectra exhibit a prominent uranium L X-ray emission peak series due to sample alpha decay rather than source-induced X-ray fluorescence. A portable EDXRF instrument was used to collect qualitative spectra from plutonium and americium, and metal alloy identification was performed on a Pu-contaminated steel sample. Significant alpha decay-induced X-ray fluorescence peaks were observed in spectra obtained from the plutonium and americium samples due to the (235)U and (237)Np daughters, respectively. The plutonium sample was also analyzed by wavelength dispersive XRF (WDXRF) to demonstrate that alpha decay-induced X-ray emission has a negligible effect on WDXRF spectra.

Rapid radiochemical sample preparation for alpha spectrometry using polymer ligand films	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Sample preparation; Plutonium; Americium; Alpha spectrometry; Extraction; Bioassay	THIN-FILMS; PRECONCENTRATION; EXTRACTION; ACTINIDES; LIQUIDS; RA-226	Rapid radioanalytical methods are adversely affected by many different sample-matrix interferences, which make analyzing samples a difficult and time consuming process. A new method for preparing radioactive samples for analysis by alpha spectrometry has been demonstrated. In this technique, a selective extractive ligand is immobilized in a polymer film coated on a metal surface. This polymer ligand film is then used to extract plutonium and other radioactive analytes from solution over a short period of time. The prepared substrate is then counted directly by alpha spectroscopy in a small single detector alpha spectrometer. The method has been demonstrated for the analysis of americium and plutonium in liquid samples such as water and urine.

Mass measurement uncertainty for plutonium aliquots assayed by controlled-potential coulometry	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Coulometry; Coulometric assay; Plutonium; Mass; Buoyancy; Uncertainty; Propagation; GUM		Minimizing plutonium measurement uncertainty is essential to nuclear material control and international safeguards. In 2005, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) published ISO 12183 "Controlled-potential coulometric assay of plutonium," 2nd edition. ISO 12183:2005 recommends a target of +/- 0.01% for the mass of original sample in the aliquot because it is a critical assay variable. Mass measurements in radiological containment were evaluated and uncertainties estimated. The uncertainty estimate for the mass measurement also includes uncertainty in correcting for buoyancy effects from air acting as a fluid and from decreased pressure of heated air from the specific heat of the plutonium isotopes.

Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) re-established the program in 2001 to assess the quality of analytical chemistry capabilities that support special nuclear material characterization. It is the only program of its kind for the preparation and distribution of plutonium metal reference materials with a range of impurity contents to multiple laboratories for destructive measurements of elemental concentration, isotopic abundance, and both metallic and non-metallic impurity levels. This program provides independent verification of analytical measurement capabilities for each of the seven currently participating laboratories, and allows any technical problems with analytical measurements to be identified and corrected. This paper focuses on basic program elements and presents a summary of methods and results for plutonium, uranium, neptunium, and americium, measurements.

Three of these targets were destructively characterized using Los Alamos National Laboratory actinide analytical chemistry capabilities. A validated conduct-of-operations protocol was followed for this characterization effort. Chemical analyses included measurements for radionuclides, uranium assay, uranium isotopic abundances, trace actinides, trace metals, and non-metals. Material scientists also examined materials for morphological and microstructural properties and individual particles were examined for trace impurities. After characterization of the targets was completed, a reactor modeling effort was undertaken to corroborate target details in historical records. Time since irradiation calculations utilized both activation and fission products. The described examination of uranium targets has a tremendous impact from a safeguards verification and nuclear forensics perspective.
