<td valign="top">AB </td><td>9-Deazaadenosine (DZA), one of the potent inhibitors of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, is known to possess several biological properties including an induction of apoptosis. To evaluate a possibility that DZA may be utilized for the treatment of human leukemia, we studied molecular events of cell death induced by DZA in human leukemia HL-60 and U-937 cells. DZA induced a specific cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and an activation of the cysteine protease caspase-3/CPP32 which is known to cleave PARP. DZA-mediated nuclear DNA-fragmentation was completely blocked in the presence of a universal inhibitor of caspases (z-VAD-fmk) or the specific inhibitor of caspase-3 (z-DEVD-fmk) unlike of cycloheximide (CHX). DNA fragmentation was preceded by the lowering of c-myc mRNA in the DZA treated cells. In addition, DZA-induced apoptosis was blocked by pretreatment with adenosine transporter inhibitors such as nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBTI) and dipyridamole (DPD). Taken together, these results demonstrate that DZA-Induced apoptosis initiated through an active transport of DZA into human leukemia cells, is dependent on the caspase-3-like activity without de nova synthesis of proteins and possibly involves c-myc down-regulation.</td>

GABP alpha subunit binds the PEA3/Ets binding sites (EBS), while GABP beta contains a transcription activation domain and mediates alpha beta dimer and alpha (2)beta (2) tetramer formation essential for activation of transcription. Here we report the cloning of 2449 bp of the mouse (m) GABP alpha promoter region including 201 bp of the 5' end of the published mGABP alpha cDNA sequence. Surprisingly, sequences homologous to the 5'UTR of mouse, rat and human mitochondrial ATP synthase coupling factor 6 (ATPsynCF6) cDNAs were found165-240 bp upstream of the mGABP alpha cDNA. A search of the non-redundant nucleotide database revealed a human genomic sequence derived from chromosome 21 (21q22) bearing significant homology to the mGABP alpha /ATPsynCF6 promoter region and encompassed the entire hGABP alpha and hATP-synCF6 genes. Primer extension analysis revealed multiple transcription start sites for both mGABP alpha and mATPsynCF6 mRNAs that mapped near the published cDNA 5' ends. Sequence analysis identified several binding sites upstream of the GABP alpha cDNA sequence including sites for GABP (-86, -104, -169, -257, and -994), YY1 (-57), Spl (-242 and -226), and NRF1 (-5). No 'TATA' motif was identified near either the GABPa or ATPsynCF6 transcription start sites. The human and mouse promoters retain significant sequence identity including binding sites for several tissue-specific transcription factors. Transient transfection assays using Luciferase reporter constructs containing the intergenic region and flanking sequences confirmed that this region of DNA promotes transcription in both directions.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The mammary gland has been found to express the gene encoding growth hormone (GH) in several species. Within the mammary gland, it may act as an autocrine paracrine growth factor for cyclic epithelial changes. and may be a determinant in mammary carcinogenrsis. In the dog, progestins enhance mammary GH expression. To elucidate the mechanism of progestin-induced mammary GH expression. the canine progestorone receptor (PR) is characterized and the cellular localization of the PR in normal and tumorous mammary tissues is examined. Sequence analysis of the canine PR revealed two in-frame ATG codons, encoding a putative PR-B protein of 939 amino acids and a putative PR-A protein of 765 amino acids. Western blot analysis indicated that both isoforms occur in uterus and mammary plant issues. Immunohistochemical analysis of the PR revealed that the PR was differentially expressed in mammary tissue. with many PR-positive epithelial cells in the proliferation phase of the glandular tissue and a low number of PR-positive cells in differentiated mammary tissue. Stromal and myoepithelial cells had no specific PR staining. Mammary tumours had a variety of staining patterns, including no staining. normal nuclear staining, marked heterogeneous immunoreactivity and perinuclear staining of tumorous epithelial cells and cytoplasmic-staining of spindle cells. Double staining showed that all GH-producing cells were positive for PR, whereas not all PR containing cells stained for GH. It is concluded that the activated PR may transactivate GH expression in the mammary gland within the same cell and functions as a pre-requisite transcription factor. However. during malignant transformation this regulation may be lost. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Modification of transcription factors would result in significant changes in the expression of related genes. Recently, the presence of transglutaminase (TGase) has been reported in nuclei, the biological significances of which have attracted a great concern. In this study, we tested the possibility that nuclear TGase would crosslink and regulate the activity of a glutamine-rich transcription factor Sp1. The addition of purified guinea pig liver TGase increased the binding activity of Sp1 to the target DNA sequence by gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The activity of the human p21(WAF1) promoter containing six Sp1 binding sites was increased by the cotransfection of the TGase 2 gene, and two Spl sites at -82 and -69, relative to the transcription start site, were essential for the increased activity in human renal embryonic 293T cells. The activity of a minimal promoter containing three consensus Sp1 binding sites was increased by co-transfection of human TGase 2 gene. The amount of Sp1 protein was increased dramatically in TGase 2-transfected 293T cells and the Sp1 protein itself from HeLa cell nuclear extracts was crosslinked readily by-purified TGase at 37 degreesC in the presence of Ca2+. These results suggest that the nuclear TGase might modulate the activity of the Spl transcription factor probably via the posttranslational or transcriptional modification of the factor by TGase.</td>

Murine MAGE (also called SMAGE or Mage) genes were found in a study aimed at detecting mouse genes homologous to human MAGE genes. However, the biological functions of MAGE and Mage are currently unknown. To understand the biological functions of Mage, in the present study a recombinant SMAGE2 (Mage-b2) protein of 43 kDa was produced and monoclonal antibodies reactive with Mage-b2 protein were generated. One monoclonal antibody, smpG4A, specifically recognized a 43 kDa protein in lysates of Mage-b2 mRNA-positive sarcoma cells and of the testis. Immunohistochemistry showed that Mage-b2 is located in the nucleus of Mage-b2 mRNA-positive sarcoma cells. These results should contribute to understanding the biological functions of Mage.</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Culture of the green mussel Perna viridis (L.) in Thai coastal waters is almost exclusively based on extensive pole culture, where spat are allowed to settle naturally on densely planted poles in shallow waters close to the shore. Such culture is limited in terms of space, and the shallow inshore regions suitable for it are vulnerable to pollution. There is immense potential for the development of suspended culture in Thai waters. In addition to increasing the yield and quality of the product, suspended cultures offer additional benefits such as providing habitats for the development of juvenile fish, and providing refugia from overfishing in relatively open waters. This study examines one potential drawback of suspended mussel culture in shallow waters such as are found in large areas of the Gulf of Thailand, namely the impact of such culture on the benthic communities. Nematode genera have been shown to be sensitive to ongoing physical and biological disturbance. In this study univariate and nonparametric multivariate analyses of nematode abundances are used to measure the extent of benthic impact resulting from a mussel raft. Although large differences in community structure are found beneath the raft, the areal extent of these changes is limited. It is concluded that if problems related to water quality and infrastructure can be dealt with, the localised benthic impact of such culture methods for the green mussel should not prevent their development in Thai coastal waters.</td>

Our analysis is focused on the structure of the uppermost mantle and based on 2D ray-tracing and inversion of the data from all 51 shots along the profile, on 2D attenuation measurements, and on the results of an analysis of the long-range P(n) phase. Three groups of reflectors within the lithosphere are associated with regional- to global boundaries previously recognized in stable continental environments. One almost continuous upper mantle boundary occurs at 65 to 80-km depth and another with an approximately 40-km-thick low-velocity zone (LVZ) occurs at 120-140 km depth. The shallow upper mantle blocks and the extensive interfaces indicate strong upper mantle heterogeneity imaged by this unique profile. The thickness of the lithosphere varies from 220 km under the Baltic Shield to about 120-130 km under the tectonically active Himalayan Altay-Sayan fold belt. Within the lower part of the lithosphere, a zone of lower velocity, increased attenuation, and varying thickness might be related to hydration and partial melting, Large structural differences related to tectonic ages and histories are characteristic for the entire lithosphere and extend 200-400 km into the asthenosphere. Analysis of QUARTZ data gives confident indication of seismic heterogeneity from crustal to regional mantle scales indicating strong involvement of the mantle in tectonic processes.

The adsorbed structure influences subsequent functional interactions with other blood components that mediate surface induced thrombosis. To examine the surface-dependent properties of VWF, we compared the adsorbed structures of VWF molecules on two different surfaces: Mica, which is hydrophilic; and octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) modified glass, which is hydrophobic. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to image adsorbed VWF under aqueous conditions at physiologic pH and ionic strength. Individual VWF molecules were clearly discernible on both surfaces. On the hydrophobic surface, VWF displayed compact tertiary structures with rare: examples of extended molecules. In addition, these data revealed intramolecular structural arrangements of the repeat units within VWF multimers. On the hydrophilic mica surface, VWF displayed extended structures in which intramolecular repeat units were exposed. The lateral dimensions of VWF on mica (640 +/- 161 x 303 +/- 113 nm were larger than on the hydrophobic OTS (256 +/- 74 x 152 +/- 62 nm, P &lt; 0.005). Our results demonstrate how surface properties mediate the molecular level structure and probable function of VWF: and provide some essential groundwork to develop a mechanistic understandings of surface-induced thrombosis.

Under this buffer condition they adsorb preferred with their extracellular side to the solid support mica. The structure of the two-dimensional light adapted crystals was resolved with an imaging force of about 100 pN up to a resolution of 13 Angstrom. The topography of the surface gets smoother if an imaging force of 1000 pN was applied indicating that protruding structures are compressed. Upon illumination with white light, during imaging with a force of 200 pN, the surface structure of the BR lattice changed. The force- and light-induced structural changes were reversible.

This technique is especially powerful for biological macromolecules because it can be utilized in situ, in the crystallization mother liquor, over long periods of time without perturbing the growing crystals. We present here observations using AFM of the nucleation and growth of crystals of satellite tobacco mosaic virus, and some recordings as well of bromegrass mosaic virus.

The overall structural features in AFM images are in good agreement with the X-ray diffraction data of these OmpC osmoporin crystals: monoclinic P2(1), with the unit cell constants a = 117.6 Angstrom, b = 110 Angstrom, c = 298.4 Angstrom, beta = 97 degrees. Such a good correspondence between X-ray diffraction and AFM data suggests that the slow and mild air-drying of these crystals did not induce any significant alterations in the crystal lattices as expected upon crystal dehydration. At the (100) crystal face, individual trimeric protein-detergent complexes were resolved. These results show the potential for studying the molecular structure of microcrystals of integral membrane proteins. This study also suggests that the crystal grew in a fashion of rapid two-dimensional expansion along the be plane followed by a slow deposition along the a axis, perhaps as a rate-limiting nucleation process. Thus, AFM imaging of air-dried crystals would also be of considerable use in the early stages of a project to grow large three-dimensional crystals of membrane proteins suitable for high-resolution X-ray diffraction studies.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to study the phase separation process occurring in block copolymers in the solid state. The simultaneous measurement of the amplitude and the phase of the oscillating cantilever in the tapping mode operation provides the surface topography along with the cartography of the microdomains of different mechanical properties. This technique thus allows to characterize the size and shape of those microdomains and their organization at the surface (e.g. cubic lattice spheres, hexagonal lattice of cylinders, or lamellae). In this study, a series of symmetric triblock copolymers made of a inner elastomeric sequence (poly(butadiene) or poly(alkylacrylate)) and two outer thermoplastic sequences (poly(methylmethacrylate)) is analyzed by AFM in the tapping mode. The microphase separation and their morphology are essential factors for the potential of these materials as a new class of thermoplastic elastomers. Special attention is paid to the control of the surface morphology, as observed by AFM, by the molecular structure of the copolymers (volume ratio of the sequences, molecular weight, length of the alkyl side group) and the experimental conditions used for the sample preparation. The molecular structure of the chains is completely controlled by the synthesis, which relies on the sequential living anionic polymerization of the comonomers. The copolymers are analyzed as solvent-cast films, whose characteristics depend on the solvent used and the annealing conditions. The surface arrangement of the phase-separated elastomeric and thermoplastic microdomains observed on the AFM phase images is discussed on the basis of quantitative information provided by the statistical analysis by Fourier transform and grain size distribution calculations.

<tr>
<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Solid state CP/MAS C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study of the insoluble organic fraction isolated by HF/HCl treatment under an inert atmosphere from the Orgueil and Murchison carbonaceous meteorites is reported. Based on these spectra, eight different types of carbons (aro- and all-linked CH3, CH2, aliphatic C-linked to heteroelements, protonated and non-protonated aromatic C, carboxyls and carbonyls) were identified, their relative amounts were determined and theoretical NMR-derived H/C atomic ratios were calculated. Comparison of these H/C ratios with those obtained from elemental analysis revealed that a large part of the carbons of the insoluble fraction of both meteorites are not detected by CP/MAS C-13 NMR. Taking into account these undetected carbons, the relative abundance of aromatic carbons (as % of the total carbons) was calculated as between 69 and 78% in Orgueil and 61 and 67% in Murchison and thus shown to be much higher than previously thought. In addition, the NMR data allowed to calculate the ratio of non-protonated and protonated aromatic carbons. Based on previous studies on chemical and thermal degradation, the present NMR data were interpreted as reflecting the occurrence of highly substituted rather small aromatic moieties in these insoluble organic materials. Along with FTIR data, NMR results also pointed to a relatively high branching level in the aliphatic chains, especially for Murchison. According to the above results, the insoluble organic matter in these meteorites did not suffer a marked thermal maturation during the late hydrothermalism of the parent body. Its synthesis involved a statistical combination of all the possible bonds between -CH3, -CH2 and -CH radicals, producing both the aliphatic and the aromatic moieties. This model explains not only the chemical features of the chondritic insoluble organic material but also the typical FTIR signature of the interstellar medium. Therefore, organic material found in the interstellar medium and that incorporated in the most primitive objects of the solar system seem to share a common organosynthesis.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The oxygen isotopic compositions of seven Al-rich chondrules from four unequilibrated ordinary chondrites were measured in situ using an ion microprobe. On an oxygen three isotope plot, the data are continuous with the ordinary chondrite ferromagnesian chondrule field but extend it to more O-16-enriched values along a mixing line of slope = 0.83 +/- 0.09, with the lightest value recorded at delta O-18 = -15.7 +/- 1.8 parts per thousand and delta O-17 = -13.5 +/- 2.6 parts per thousand. If Al-rich chondrules were mixtures of ferromagnesian chondrules and CAI material, their bulk chemical compositions would require them to exhibit larger O-16 enrichments than we observe. Therefore, Al-rich chondrules are not simple mixtures of these two components. Three chondrules exhibit significant internal isotopic heterogeneity indicative of partial exchange with a gaseous reservoir. Porphyritic Al-rich chondrules are consistently O-16-rich relative to nonporphyritic ones, suggesting that degree of melting is a key factor and pointing to a nebular setting for the isotopic exchange process. Because Al-rich chondrules are closely related to ferromagnesian chondrules, their radiogenic Mg isotopic abundances can plausibly be applied to help constrain the timing or location of chondrule formation.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Oxygen isotope ratios in phenocrysts from recent Theistareykir lavas (Iceland) are consistently O-18-depleted relative to common terrestrial basalts (e.g. delta O-18 olivine = 4.7-4.1 parts per thousand) and correlate with geochemical indices of 'enrichment' (e.g. K2O/TiO2; La/Sm) and major element indices of differentiation (e.g. Mg#; CaO/Na2O). The sense of these correlations is that decreasing delta O-18 is accompanied by increasing 'enriched' geochemical signatures and an increasing extent of differentiation. These trends are similar to (although more subtle than) those defined by highly differentiated and contaminated Icelandic andesites, dacites and rhyolites. The trends we observe are consistent with models in which primary recent Theistareykir magmas are highly 'depleted' in their incompatible element geochemistry and similar in delta O-18 to common terrestrial basalts; differentiation of these magmas is accompanied by contamination by the low delta O-18, and on average more 'enriched' rocks of the Icelandic crust to produce the observed spectrum in delta O-18 and other geochemical indices. Our results suggest that geochemical variations among recent Theistareykir lavas are only indirect constraints on the composition and dynamics of the Iceland plume. Extrapolation of the geochemical trends we observe to oxygen isotope compositions within the range of common oceanic basalts suggests that primary recent Theistareykir magmas are exceptionally depleted (e.g. La/Sm = 0.2-0.5), indicating unusually high degrees and/or multiple stages of melting of their sources.

<tr>
<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Nautile submersible investigations of mud volcanoes and brine seep areas of the eastern Mediterranean Sea during the MEDINAUT cruise in November 1998 discovered extensive areas of authigenic carbonate crusts associated with methane emissions. Carbonate crusts form pavements, round slabs and circular mounds on the central, most active parts of mud volcanoes and in a fault-related valley where brines have accumulated to form a submarine brine lake. Authigenic carbonate nodules have been recovered from the same areas during the MEDINETH cruise in July 1999. Large C-13 depletions of authigenic calcite, aragonite and dolomite indicate methane as a major carbon source for the carbonate. Crust pavements are formed when methane from a freshly emplaced, methane-charged mud flow is oxidised at the seafloor. In this environment, where bottom waters provide the sulphate and magnesium, aragonite is favoured versus calcite and accounts for the majority of the methane-related authigenic carbonates. Calcite, when present, contains significant amounts of Mg2+ (high-Mg calcite), and possibly other divalent ions in its crystal lattice. In areas of brine seep and accumulation, dolomitic nodules are present at shallow depth in the sediment. The O-18 enrichment of the authigenic carbonates (up to 4 parts per thousand greater than calculated values for carbonates precipitating from modern eastern Mediterranean bottom waters) is interpreted as due to precipitation from O-18-rich fluids rather than as a temperature effect. The source of the O-18-rich fluids may be multiple and possibly includes the destabilisation of gas hydrates present at shallow subbottom depth, and the seepage of relic Messinian brines.

Here, the independent multicodon (IMC) model, a nearly neutral mutation model assuming no interaction among codons, was studied when population size changes using computer simulation. Patterns of variation expected under the model were investigated using statistics for the neutrality tests. The average dispersion index is more than one when population size changes slowly but it never becomes large. The diversity at linked silent site decreases when the strength of selection is intermediate and the reduction is larger when population size changes slowly. Tajima's (1989. Genetics 123, 585-595) D is generally negative. Rejections by the Tajima's test occur more frequently if population size changes quickly but the effect of selection is confounded with the size change itself in this case. If we apply the test of McDonald and Kreitman (1991. Nature 351, 652-654), the rejection is always in the direction of excess replacement polymorphisms. The rejection probability decreases as the rate of population size changes decreases. These results show that the predictions of the IMC model are consistent with the pattern observed in mitochondrial DNA data but not consistent with some data of nuclear DNA. Interaction among codons or variable selection would be necessary to explain such cases. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

While the strictly neutral model suggests a neutralist-selectionist dichotomy, the nearly neutral model is a continuous model spanning strict neutrality through weak selection (Ns similar to 1) to deterministic selection (Ns &gt; 3). We illustrate these points with polymorphism and divergence data from a sample of 73 genes (31 mitochondrial, 36 nuclear genes from Drosophila, and six Arabidopsis data sets). In an earlier study we used the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test to show that amino acid replacement polymorphism in animal mitochondrial genes and Arabidopsis genes show a consistent trend toward negative selection, whereas nuclear genes from Drosophila span a range from negative selection, through neutrality, to positive selection. Here we analyze a subset of these genes (13 Drosophila nuclear, ten mitochondrial, and six Arabidopsis nuclear) for polymorphism and divergence of conservative and radical amino acid replacements (a protein-based conservative-radical MK, or pMK, test). The distinct patterns of selection between the different genomes is not apparent with the pMK test. Different definitions of conservative and radical (based on amino acid polarity volume or charge) give inconsistent results across genes. We suggest that segregating fitness difference between silent and replacement mutations are more visible to selections than are segregating fitness differences between conservative and radical amino acid and replacement mutations are more visible to selection than are segregating fitness differences between conservative and radical amino acid mutations. New data on the variation among genes with different opportunities for positive and negative selection are as important to the continuum view of the neutralist-selectionist debate as is the distribution of selection coefficients within individual genes.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>NKX3A (NKX3.1) is a recently identified androgen-regulated gene that is largely specific to prostate for expression and likely to code for a homeobox protein. Here we report the full-length mRNA and genomic organization of human NKX3.1. There are at least five different splice variants of NKX3.1 mRNA that result in different open reading frames (ORFs). There is extensive similarity between the human and the mouse NKX3.1 cDNA sequences outside of the ORFs (greater than 60% overall identity), which may be involved in modulating NKX3.1 expression. In addition to its androgen regulation in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, we show that NKX3.1 expression is androgen-dependent in the CWR22 prostate cancer xenograft model. Interestingly, NKX3.1 is highly expressed in the androgen-independent derivative CWR22R in the absence of androgens, indicating that it may be deregulated in advanced prostate cancer. Using a Green Flourescent Protein fusion construct, we show that NKX3.1 is a nuclear protein consistent with its proposed function as a homeobox transcription factor. Furthermore, in addition to androgens, NKX3.1 expression is up-regulated by 17 beta -estradiol, but not by progesterone, dexamethasone, or 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine in LNCaP cells. Regulation of NKX3.1 by androgens and 17 beta -estradiol in prostate cancer cells and its deregulation in androgen-independent prostate cancer suggest that it may have important regulatory roles during prostate cancer progression.

With two-hybrid screening using DREF as a bait, we have obtained a clone encoding a protein homologous to human myelodysplasia/myeloid leukemia factor 1 (hMLF1). We termed the protein Drosophila MLF (dMLF); it consists of a polypeptide of 309 amino acid residues, whose sequence shares 23.1% identity with hMLF1. High conservation of 54.2% identity over 107 amino acids was found in the central region. The dMLF gene was mapped to 52D on the second chromosome by in situ hybridization. Interaction between dMLF and DREF in vitro could be confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay, with the conserved central region appearing to play an important role in this. Northern blot hybridization analysis revealed dMLF mRNA levels to be high in unfertilized eggs, early embryos, pupae and adult males, and relatively low in adult females and larvae. This fluctuation of mRNA during Drosophila development is similar to that observed for DREF mRNA, except in the pupa and adult male. Using a specific antibody against the dMLF, we performed immunofluorescent staining of Drosophila Kc cells and showed a primarily cytoplasmic staining, whereas DREF localizes in the nucleus. However, dMLF protein contains a putative 14-3-3 binding motif involved in the subcellular localization of various regulatory molecules, and interaction with DREF could be regulated through this motif. The transgenic fly data suggesting the genetic interaction between DREF and dMLF support this possibility. Characterization of dMLF in the present study provides the molecular basis for analysis of its significance in Drosophila. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The different roles of variable mantle sources and intra-crustal differentiation processes at Bakening volcano (Kamchatka) and contemporaneous basaltic monogenetic centers are studied using major and trace elements and isotopic data. Three suites of volcanic activity are recognized: (1) plateau basalts of Lower Pleistocene age; (2) andesites and dacites of the Bakening volcano, the New Bakening volcano dacitic centers nearby; and (3) contemporaneous basaltic cinder cones erupted along subduction zone--parallel N-S faults. Age-data show that the last eruptions in the Bakening area occurred only 600-1200 years ago, suggesting the volcano is potentially active.
   <br>Major element variations and petrographic observations provides evidence for a fractionation assemblage of olivine, clinopyroxene, +/-plagioclase, +/-magnetite (?) within the basaltic suite. The fractionation in the andesites and dacites is dominated by amphibole, clinopyroxene. orthopyroxene and plagioclase plus minor amounts of magnetite and apatite. The youngest cpx-opx-andesites of Bakening main volcano deviate from that trend. Their source was probably formed by mixing of basaltic magmas into the silicic magma chamber of the Bakening volcano. Overall trace element patterns as well as the Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions are quite similar in all rocks despite large differences in their chemical composition (from basalt to rhyodacite). In detail however, the andesite-dacites of the central Bakening volcano show a stronger enrichment in the more incompatible elements and depletion in HREE compared to the monogenetic basaltic centers. This results in a crossing of the REE-pattern for the two suites. The decrease in the HREEs can be explained by amphibole fractionation. A slab component is less likely because it would result in fractionation of the HREE from each other, which is not observed. The higher relative amounts of LILE in the dacitic and the large scatter in the basaltic rocks must be the result of a variable source enrichment by slab-derived fluids overprinting a variable depleted mantle wedge. The plateau basalts are less depleted in HFSE and show a more fractionated HREE pattern. These lavas could either result from a slab component or the addition of an OIB-type enriched mantle in their source. (C) 2000 EIsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Calmodulin (CaM), a keg calcium sensor in all eukaryotes, regulates diverse cellular processes by interacting with other proteins. To isolate CaM binding proteins involved in ethylene signal transduction, we screened an expression library prepared from ethylene-treated Arabidopsis seedlings with S-35-labeled CaM. A cDNA clone, EICBP (Ethylene-Induced CaM Binding Protein), encoding a protein that interacts with activated CaM was isolated in this screening. The CaM: binding domain in EICBP was mapped to the C-terminus of the protein. These results indicate that calcium, through CaM, could regulate the activity of EICBP. The EICBP is expressed in different tissues and its expression in seedlings is induced by ethylene. The EICBP contains, in addition to a CaM binding domain, several features that are typical of transcription factors. These include a DNA-binding domain at the N terminus, an acidic region at the C terminus, and nuclear localization signals. In database searches a partial cDNA (CG-1) encoding a DNA-binding motif from parsley and an ethylene up-regulated partial cDNA from tomato (ER66) showed significant similarity to EICBP. In addition, five hypothetical proteins in the Arabidopsis genome also showed a very high sequence similarity with EICBP, indicating that there are several EICBP-related proteins in Arabidopsis. The structural features of EICBP are conserved in all EICBP-related proteins in Arabidopsis, suggesting that they may constitute a new family of DNA binding proteins and are Likely to be involved in modulating gene expression in the presence of ethylene.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is an autosomal dominant form of diabetes characterized by early onset of pancreatic dysfunction. MODY type 3 is caused by mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1 alpha. During a screening of Norwegian patients with suspected MODY we identified two novel HNF-1 alpha mutations, P112L and Q466X. The molecular mechanisms underlying the disease were studied by analyzing the DNA binding properties, transcriptional activation, and subcellular localization of HNF-1 alpha P112L and Q466X compared to wild type HNF-1 alpha. P112L had reduced ability to bind an HNF1 consensus sequence and to activate transcription. Q486X did not differ from wild type HNF-1 alpha in DNA binding activity. Transactivation, however, was markedly reduced. When both mutants were coexpressed with wild type HNF-1 alpha in HeLa cells, transcriptional activity appeared unaffected, suggesting that a dominant-negative mechanism was not present. Immunolocalization experiments showed that P112L HNF-1 alpha was correctly targeted to nuclei in HeLa cells. In contrast, some Q466X HNF-1 alpha protein was retained in the cytoplasm, which indicated that the mechanism for nuclear localization was disturbed. Thus, the HNF-1 alpha mutations P112L and Q466X both seem to impair pancreatic p cell function by loss of-function mechanisms; P112L by reduced DNA binding and reduced ability to transactivate, and Q466X by reduced transactivation and incomplete nuclear targeting.

Sequence analysis of the ER beta isoform PCR product reveals the absence of 139 bp that corresponds to the entire exon 5 of wild-type ER beta, which predicts 60 lack part of the hormone-binding domain, The transient expression of the exon 5-deleted isoform of ERP (ERP beta Delta5) had no effect on basal transactivation activity of an estrogen-responsive luciferase reporter gene. This finding was in contrast to the previous reports that the exon 8-deleted isoform of ER alpha (ER alpha Delta5) acts as a dominant positive receptor, increasing basal gene transactivation itself. Moreover, when ER beta Delta5 was cotransfected with the wild-type ER alpha or ER beta, it behaved as a dominant negative receptor that inhibited not only estradiol-stimulated transactivation by ER beta but also that by ER alpha. The ligand-independent nuclear localization of ER beta Delta5 was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, and the coexpression of the isoform and the wild-type receptors could be observed in a single cell that transfected with both receptor cDNAs, These findings indicate that ER beta Delta5 has a potential as a dominant negative receptor that blocks both ER alpha and ER beta signaling pathways, suggesting some physiological roles of this isoform as an "ER inhibitor''.

An RXR alpha mutant in which serine residue 27 is mutated to alanine is no longer phosphorylated by PKA. In vivo transfection experiments in COS cells indicate that cyclicAMP represses retinoic acid-mediated transcriptional activation of RXR alpha and this repression is mediated by serine 27. These results indicate that serine 27 of RXR alpha is an unique target for phosphorylation by PKA in vitro and it has an important role in the crosstalk between RXR alpha and cyclicAMP signalling pathways.

NIH3T3 cells cultured in bovine serum albumin-coated dishes (detached from the extracellular matrix) underwent apoptosis under serum-free conditions, which was inhibited by UVB (&lt;0.1 J/cm(2)) irradiation, keeping suspension conditions, as determined by chromatin condensation and the appearance of a subG1 DNA fraction. Furthermore, UVB irradiation decreased caspase-3/7, -8/6, and -9 activation and eliminated loss of mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential, suggesting suppression upstream of the caspase cascade. Treatment with PI3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin, and LY294002 partly eliminated the UV-mediated inhibition of cell death and recovered the inhibited caspase-3/7 activity. Phosphorylation of Akt was observed from 15 min after UVB irradiation. These results suggested that UVB irradiation transduced a survival signal via PI3 kinase activation and phosphorylation of Akt, and induced some apoptosis inhibition factors upstream of the caspase cascade.

For these reasons along with the timely cloning of the gene, ease of expression and purification and availability of atomic resolution structures, subtilisin became a model system for protein engineering studies in the 1980s. Fifteen years later, mutations in well over 50% of the 275 amino acids of subtilisin have been reported in the scientific literature. Most subtilisin engineering has involved catalytic amino acids, substrate binding regions and stabilizing mutations. Stability has been the property of subtilisin which has been most amenable to enhancement, yet perhaps least understood. This review will give a brief overview of the subtilisin engineering field, critically review what has been learned about subtilisin stability from protein engineering experiments and conclude with some speculation about the prospects for future subtilisin engineering.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Previous studies have shown that during hypoxia, neuronal nuclear high affinity Ca2+-ATPase activity is increased in the cerebral cortex of newborn piglets. The present study tests the hypothesis that pretreatment with N-nitro-L-arginine (NNLA) will prevent the hypoxia-induced increase in high affinity Ca2+-ATPase activity in cortical neuronal nuclear membrane of newborn piglets. We also tested the hypothesis that nitration is a mechanism of elevation of the high affinity Ca2+-ATPase activity during hypoxia. Studies were performed in Rye normoxic, five hypoxic, and six NNLA-pretreated (40 mg/kg) hypoxic newborn piglets. Cerebral cortical neuronal nuclei were isolated and the high affinity Ca2+-ATPase activity was determined. Further, normoxic samples were aliquoted into two sub-groups for in vitro nitration with 0.5 mM peroxynitrite and subsequent determination of the high affinity Ca2+-ATPase activity. The activity increased from 309+/-40 nmol Pi/mg protein/h in the normoxic group to 520+/-108 nmol Pi/mg protein/h in the hypoxic group (P&lt;0.05). In the NNLA-pretreated group, the activity was 442+/-53 nmol Pi/mg protein/h (P&lt;0.05), which is 25% lower than in the hypoxic group. Tn the nitrated group the enzyme activity increased to 554+/-59 nmol Pi/mg protein/h (P&lt;0.05). Thus peroxynitrire-induced nitration in vitro increased the high affinity Ca2+-ATPase activity and NNLA administration in vivo partially prevented the hypoxia induced increase in neuronal nuclear high affinity Ca2+-ATPase activity. We conclude that the hypoxia-induced increase in nuclear membrane high affinity Ca2+-ATPase activity is NO-mediated and that nitration of the enzyme is a mechanism of its modification.

A basic issue remains unresolved concerning the distribution of cranin in brain: are the alpha and beta subunits coordinately expressed at the synapse? We report here that cranin is indeed enriched progressively in synaptosomes and synaptic membranes of sheep brain, as assessed by immunoblotting and laminin-blotting assays, and that the extent of enrichment is similar for both alpha and beta subunits. These findings support the hypothesis that cranin (dystroglycan) contributes to synaptic function in the CNS. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science BN. All rights reserved.</td>

In the current studies, mice with lupus-like systemic autoimmunity were able to learn active, as well as passive, avoidance protocols with shock as reinforcement. Therefore, the behavioral deficits seen in active avoidance tasks are not a consequence of the use of electric shock. Rather, the current findings suggest that the inability of autoimmune mice to learn shock motivated responding is due to multiple performance factors, including shock level and properties of the testing apparatus.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Recent data imply that mitochondrial regulation of calcium is critical in the process leading to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. The aim was to study the subcellular distribution of calcium in correlation with ultrastructural changes after hypoxia-ischemia in neonatal rats. Seven-day-old rats were subjected to permanent unilateral carotid artery ligation and exposure to hypoxia (7.7% oxygen in nitrogen) for 90 min. Animals were perfusion-fixed after 30 min, 3 h or 24 h of reperfusion. Sections were sampled for light microscopy and electron microscopy combined with the oxalate-pyroantimonate technique. At 30 min and 3 h of reflow, 3 progressive accumulation of calcium was detected in the endoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasm, nucleus and, most markedly, in the mitochondrial matrix of neurons in the gray matter in the core area of injury. Some mitochondria developed a considerable degree of swelling reaching a diameter of several mum at 3 h of reflow whereas the majority of mitochondria appeared moderately affected. Chromatin condensation was observed in nuclei of many cells with severely swollen mitochondria with calcium deposits. A whole spectrum of morphological features ranging from necrosis to apoptosis was seen in degenerating cells. After 24 h, there was extensive injury in the cerebral cortex as judged by breaks of mitochondrial and plasma membranes, and a general decrease of cellular electron density. In the white matter of the core area of injury, the axonal elements exhibited varicosity-like swellings filled with calcium-pyroantimonate deposits. Furthermore, the thin myelin sheaths were loaded with calcium. Numerous oligodendroglia-like cells displayed apoptotic morphology 'with shrunken cytoplasm and chromatin condensation, whereas astroglial necrosis was not seen. In conclusion, markedly swollen 'giant' mitochondria with large amounts of calcium were found at 3 h of reperfusion often in neuronal cells with condensation of the nuclear chromatin. The results are discussed in relation to mitochondrial permeability transition and activation of apoptotic processes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

Using the silver carbonate method we have been able to study the ciliary pattern of vegetative and dividing cells. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that there is no micro-macronuclear complex in this species. This type of nuclear apparatus thus cannot be considered as most important apomorphy of the Cyrtolophosidida. Division is in the swimming condition, stomatogenesis is pleurotelokinetal. Feulgen stain indicates the absence of a macronuclear chromatin extrusion process during both division and encystment. Cortical and cytoplasmic phenomena during encystment are similar to those of Colpoda spp. These data and ultrastructural observations of mature resting cysts indicate that Cyrtolophosis elongata has resting cysts of PKR (Partial-kinetosome-resorbing) type, with a cyst wall composed by two layers.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In 1940, Tetrahymena pyriformis GL was reported amicronucleate by W. H. Furgason. Unable to renew its genetic complement through conjugation, the ciliate still thrives with unchanged phenotype. This fact indicates physical integrity of the haploid macronuclear genome (5 "chromosomes") during cell division, as also reflected in 90 unit-sized chromatin aggregates ("subnuclei") distributed equally to the daughters. This stands in contrast to biochemical sizing of bulk macronuclear DNA in thousands of subchromosomal DNA fragments distributed randomly during cell division. The purpose was to investigate the problem utilizing vanadate that affects nuclear division so that the daughters may receive anything from the entire G(2)-nucleus to no nucleus at all [39]; in theory a single aggregate suffices to survive. Single cell cultures of daughters, derived from cells divided in vanadate, revealed survival of all, but not anucleate, daughters and progeny of unchanged phenotype, hence indicating that the macronuclear chromatin aggregates contain full genetic complement. "Amitosis" in Tetrahymena is genome segregation but equal karyokinesis depends on correct positioning of the macronucleus, properly related to its anterior and posterior movements prior to elongation as though it becomes anchored to both cell poles. Vanadate disturbed correct positioning of the nucleus.</td>

The in vitro translated protein shows a molecular weight of 57 kDa. WHSC2 has two nuclear translocation sequences which actively mediate its transport to the nucleus, as shown in whsc2-GFP-transfected NIH-3T3, We also found a helix-loop-helix (HLH) motif in region 130-185, Since members of the HLH family control differentiation and cell cycle progression, we hypothesize that WHSC2 may function as a transcriptional repressor.

Both HO isoforms were detected in rat IBAT. They were immunolocalized in the cytoplasm and/or nuclei of brown adipocytes, in parenchymal capillaries, arteries and in some veins and nerves. Whereas cold exposure did not affect HO-2 expression, it significantly increased the expression of HO-1, both at mRNA (about 3-fold) and protein (about 2-fold) levels, reflecting the increased expression of HO-1 in the brown adipotytes and endothelial cells of parenchymal capillaries. Western blotting of cytosolic and nuclear protein extracts from cultured differentiated brown adipocytes showed that HO-1 and HO-2 are indeed localized in the cytosol and nuclei of brown adipocytes; and that noradrenaline stimulation significantly increased their amount in cytosol but not in the nuclear fraction.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>As a result of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant (NPP) the environment was contaminated with spent nuclear fuel. The U-236 isotope was used in this study to monitor the spent uranium from nuclear fallout in soil samples collected in the vicinity of the Chernobyl NPP. A rapid and sensitive analytical procedure for uranium isotopic ratio measurement in environmental samples based on inductively coupled plasma quadrupole mass spectrometry with a hexapole collision cell (HEX-ICP-QMS) was developed. Figures of merit for the HEX-ICP-QMS were studied with a plasma-shielded torch using different nebulizers [such as an ultrasonic nebulizer (USN) and a Meinhard nebulizer] for the solution introduction. An U-238(+) ion intensity of up to 27 000 MHz/ppm in HEX-ICP-QMS with USN was observed by introducing helium into the hexapole collision cell as the collision gas at a how rate of 10 mL min(-1). The formation rate of uranium hydride ions UH+/U+ of 2 x 10(-6) was obtained by using USN with a membrane desolvator. The detection limit for U-236 in 10 mug L-1 uranium solution was 3 pg L-1 corresponding to the limit of U-236/U-238 ratio determination of 3 x 10(-7). in the case of low isotopic abundance of U-236 (&lt;10(-5)). the measured isotopic ratio in the synthetic mixture was systematically lower than the calculated ratio. The precision of uranium isotopic ratio measurements in 10 &lt;mu&gt;g L-l laboratory uranium isotopic standard solution was 0.13% (U-235/U-238) and 0.33% (U-236/U-238) using a Meinhard nebulizer and 0.45% (U-235/U-238) and 0.88% (U-236/U-238) using an USN. The isotopic composition of all investigated Chernobyl soil samples differed from those of natural uranium: i.e. in these samples the U-236/U-238 ratio ranged from 10(-5) to 10(-3). Results of isotopic ratio measurement by HEX-ICP-QMS in soil samples are in agreement with those obtained by using a double-focusing sector field ICP-MS within experimental errors.(C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.</td>

It is often necessary to perform measurements rapidly at the parts per million level on milligram quantities of sample. However, current methodologies require conversion to gas and/or time consuming multiple precipitation steps or insensitive nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. in the electrospray method developed here, lengthy analyses requiring precipitation of phosphate are unnecessary. Moreover, there is no requirement for conversion to a simple gas and indirect evaluation. Accuracy is demonstrated by good agreement with NMR measurements on concentrated laboratory prepared chemical solutions. After dilution, electrospray analyses gave similar results.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a member of the steroid/retinoid receptor superfamily of nuclear receptors that has potential tumor-suppressive functions. We show here that VDR interacts with and is regulated by BAG1L, a nuclear protein that binds heat shock 70-kDa (Hsp70) family molecular chaperones. Endogenous BAG1L can be eo-immunoprecipitated with VDR from prostate cancer cells (ALVA31; LNCaP) in a ligand-dependent manner. BAG1L, but not shorter non-nuclear isoforms of this protein (BAG1; BAG1M/Rap46), markedly enhanced, in a ligand-dependent manner, the ability of VDR to trans-activate reporter gene plasmids containing a vitamin D response element in transient transfection assays. Mutant BAG1L lacking the C-terminal Hsc70-binding domain suppressed tin a concentration-dependent fashion) VDR-mediated trans-activation of vitamin D response element-containing reporter gene plasmids, without altering levels of VDR or endogenous BAG1L protein, suggesting that it operates as a trans-dominant inhibitor of BAG1L. Gene transfer-mediated elevations in BAG1L protein levels in a prostate cancer cell line (PC3), which is moderately responsive to VDR ligands, increased the ability of natural (1 alpha ,25(OH)(2) vitamin D-3) and synthetic (1 alpha ,25-dihydroxy19-nor-22(E)-vitamin D-3) VDR ligands to induce expression of the VDR target gene, p21(Waf1), and suppress DNA synthesis. Thus, BAG1L is a direct regulator of VDR, which enhances its trans-activation function and improves tumor cell responses to growth-suppressive VDR ligands.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Drosophila Uba2 and Ubc9 SUMO-1 conjugation enzyme homologs (DmUba2 and DmUbc9) were isolated as calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) interacting proteins by yeast two-hybrid screening of an adult head cDNA library. We found that at least one isoform of Drosophila neuronal CaMXII is conjugated to DmSUMO-1 in vivo. The interactions observed in the two-hybrid screen may therefore reflect catalytic events. To understand the role of SUMO conjugation in the brain, we undertook a characterization of the system. The other required components of the system, Drosophila Aos1 and SUMO-1 (DmAos1 and DmSUMO-1), were identified in expressed sequence tag data base searches. Purified recombinant DmUbaB/DmAos1 dimer can activate DmSUMO-1 in vitro and transfer DmSUMO-1 to recombinant DmUbc9. DmSUMO-1 conjugation occurs in all developmental stages of Drosophila and in the adult central nervous system. Overexpression of a putative dominant negative DmUba2(C175S) mutant protein in the Drosophila central nervous system resulted in an increase in overall DmSUMO-1 conjugates and a base-sensitive p120 species, which is likely to be DmUba2(C175S) linked to endogenous DmSUMO-1 through an oxygen ester bond. Overexpression of DmUba2(wt) protein in vivo also led to increased levels of DmSUMO-1 conjugates. High level overexpression of either DmUba2(wt) or DmUba2(C175S) in the Drosophila central nervous system caused pupal and earlier stage lethality. Expression in the developing eye led to a rough eye phenotype with retinal degeneration. These results suggest that normal SUMO conjugation is essential in the differentiated nervous system and reveal a potential novel mechanism that regulates neuronal calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II function.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Receptor-interacting protein 140 (RIP140) encodes a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor-sensitive repressive activity. Direct interaction of RIP140 with HDAC1 and HDAC3 occurs in vitro and in vivo as demonstrated in co-immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments. The HDAC-interacting domain of RIP140 is mapped to its N-terminal domain, between amino acids 78 and 303 based upon glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, it is demonstrated that histone deacetylation occurs at the chromatin region of the Ga14 binding sites as a result of Ga14 DNA binding domain-tethered RIP expression. The immunocomplexes of RIP140 from cells transfected with RIP140 and HDAC are able to deacetylate histone proteins in vitro. This study presents the first evidence for RIP140 as a negative coregulator for nuclear receptor actions by directly recruiting histone deacetylases and categorizes RIP140 as a novel negative coregulator that is able to directly interact with HDACs.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Members of the p160 coactivator family (steroid receptor coactivator-l (SRC-1), glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1), and activator of thyroid and retinoic acid receptors (ACTR)) mediate transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors, After being recruited to the promoter by nuclear receptors, the p160 coactivator transmits the activating signal via two C-terminal activation domains, AD1 and AD2, AD1 is a binding site for the related coactivators cAMP-response element binding protein binding protein (CBP) and p300, whereas AD2 binds to another coactivator, coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1), a protein-arginine methyltransferase. The current study explored the cooperative functional and mechanistic relationships among GRIP1, CARM1, and p300 in transient transfection assays, where they enhanced the ability of the estrogen receptor (ER) to activate transcription of a reporter gene. The coactivator functions of p300 and CARM1 depended on the co-expression of GRIP1. Simultaneous co-expression of all three coactivators caused a synergistic enhancement of ER function. Deletion of the AD1 domain of GRIP1 abolished the ability of p300 to potentiate ER activity but had no effect on CARM1-mediated stimulation. In contrast, when the AD2 domain of GRIP1 was deleted, p300 still stimulated ER function through the mutant GRIP1, but CARM1 failed to do so. Thus, both binding of p300 to AD1 and binding of CARM1 to AD2 are required for their respective coactivator functions and for their synergy. Furthermore, CARM1 and p300 function independently through different activating domains of GRIP1, and their synergy suggests that they enhance transcription by different, complementary. mechanisms.</td>
